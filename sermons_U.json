After a forest fire in \nYellowstone National Park, forest rangers began their trek up a \nmountain to assess the inferno's damage.   One ranger found a bird \nliterally petrified in ashes, perched statuesquely on the ground at \nthe base of a tree.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with a \nstick.  When he struck it, three tiny chicks scurried from under \ntheir dead mother's wings. The loving mother, keenly aware of \nimpending disaster, had carried the offspring to the base of the tree \nand had gathered them under her wings, instinctively knowing that the \ntoxic smoke would rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe could have flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies. \nWhen the blaze had arrived and the heat had scorched her small body, \nthe mother had remained steadfast.  Because she had been willing to \ndie, those under the cover of her wings would live.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will \nfind refuge;..

    "title": "UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY - HOLOCAUST",
    "words": "Most people in Europe during the Holocaust silently stood by and did \nnothing.  In spite of the risks, a small number of individuals \nrefused to stand by and watch. These people had the courage to help \nby providing hiding places, underground escape routes, false papers, \nfood, clothing, money, and sometimes even weapons.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some examples of \"underground\" activity:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) Denmark was THE ONLY country that actively resisted the Nazi \nregime's attempts to deport its Jewish citizens.  On September 28, \n1943, Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, a German diplomat, secretly informed \nthe Danish resistance that the Nazis were planning to deport the \nDanish Jews.   The Danes responded quickly, organizing a nationwide \neffort to smuggle the Jews by sea to neutral Sweden.  Warned of the \nGerman plans, Jews began to leave Copenhagen (the capitol), where \nmost of the 8,000 Jews in Denmark lived, and other cities, by train, \ncar and on foot.  With the help of the Danish people, they found \nhiding places in homes, hospitals, and churches.  Within a two week \nperiod fisherman helped ferry 7,220 Danish Jews and 680 non-Jewish \nfamily members to safety across the narrow body of water separating \nDenmark from Sweden.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effort was not totally successful, however.  Almost 500 Danish \nJews were deported to the Theresienstadt (pronounced -- \nTer-reeson-stot) ghetto, an area of a city where people were confined \nagainst their will, in Czechoslovakia.  Yet even of these Jews, all \nbut 51 survived the Holocaust, largely because the Danish Red Cross \nsent food to the Jews in the ghetto, and because the Danish officials \npressured the Germans with their concerns for the well-being of those \nwho had been deported.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. In France nearly 12,000 Jewish children were rescued by clergymen \nwho found housing for them and even smuggled some into Switzerland \nand Spain.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. About 20,000 Polish Jews were able to survive in hiding outside \nthe ghetto in Warsaw (the worst of all the ghettos) because some \nChristians and some others provided shelter for them in their homes.  \nSome Jews were even hidden in the Warsaw Zoo by the zoo's director, \nJan Zabinski  (Jan -- pronounced - Yan)\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat based in Budapest, Hungary, \nhelped protect TENS OF THOUSANDS of Hungarian Jews from being \ndeporteod to Auschwitz (the worst of all the extermination/labor \ncamps) by distributing Swedish passports to them. Because Sweden was \na neutral county, Germany could not easily harm Swedish citizens. \nWallenberg also set up hospitals, nurseries, and soup kitchens for \nthe Jews of Budapest.  Wallenberg disappeared during the Russian \nliberation of Budapest.  He was seen for the last time in the company \nof Soviet troops on January 17, 1945.  Ten years later, the Soviet \nUnion admitted that he had been arrested and claimed that he died in \nprison in 1947.  (It is believed that he was alive much later than \nthat, as reported by some soviet prisoners who had been released \nearlier.)  That is the greatest tragedy of the war, a man so \ncommitted to saving the lives of others he didn't even know, and it \ncost him his life.  The street on which the National Holocaust Museum \nis located in Washington is named after him. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Of the Germans who opposed Hitler's dictatorship, only one group \nopenly protested the Nazi genocide (the attempt to blot out the \nJewish people) against the Jews.  The \"White Rose\" movement was \nfounded in June, 1942 by Hans School, a 24-year-old medical student \nat the University of Munich (pronounced - Mu-nick), his 22-year-old \nsister Sophie, and 24-year-old Christoph Probst.  Although the exact \norigin of the name \"White Rose\" is unknown, it clearly stands for \npurity and innocence in the face of evil.  Hans, Sophie, and \nChristoph were outraged that educated Germans went along with Nazi \npolicies.  They distributed anti-Nazi leaflets and painted slogans \nlike \"LFreedom!\" and \"Down with Hitler!\" on walls of the university.  \nIn February, 1943, Hans and Sophie were caught distributing leaflets \nand arrested.  Together with their friend Christoph, they were \nexecuted four days later.  Han's last words were \"Long Live Freedom!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n6. In the summer of 1942, when about 300,000 Jews were being deported \nfrom Warsaw to Treblinka (one of the concentration camps), a \n23-year-old Mordecai Anielewicz (pronounced= mordi-ki  \noni-ay-lo-vitch) issued a proclamation calling for the Jewish people \nto resist going to the railroad cars that were to take them away.  \nGhetto fighters firied upon German troops as they tried to round up \nanother group of ghetto inhabitants for deportation.  After a few \ndays the troops squashed the uprising, but the small victory inspired \nghetto fighters to prepare for future resistance.  Mordecai was \nkilled but remains a major figure in the history of Jewish resistance.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Twenty-three-year-old Hannah Senesh, a Hungarian Jew who had \nemigrated (left Hungary earlier) to go to Palestine in 1939, was one \nof  the  thirty-two Palestinian parachutists the British dropped \nbehind German lines to organize resistance and rescue efforts.  \nBefore crossing the border into Hungary on  June 7, 1944, to warn \nHungarian Jews about the extermination camps, Senesh, a poet, handed \na poem to one of her companions.  It ended with these lines:\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\t\tBlessed is the heart with strength to stop its beating\u0014\n                                                                for \nhonor's sake\u0014\n                                   Blessed is the match consumed in \nkindling flame.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSenesh was captured the next day and executed as a traitor.\u0014",

These days we even celebrate unwed \nmotherhood as though we've managed to do something remarkable  rather \nthan something unforgivably selfish.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're especially rewarded when a famous person behaves infamously. \nMadonna and Jo-die Foster come to mind. Who can forget the People \nmagazine cover a few years ago that featured a pregnant Foster and \nthe breathless headline: And Baby Makes Two!\u0014\n\u0014\nNow nearly half the women in U.S. maternity wards are following the \nstars. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, some \n1.29 million babies were born to single women in 1998, a statistic \nthat prompted even Donna Shalala to furrow her brow. The Secretary of \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services called the trend \ntroubling. In my tribe, troubling is what we say when the \ncrabgrass is taking over the yard. When half the babies in America \nare being born outside wedlock, we use words like outrageous and \ntragic.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHESE AREN'T teen moms, either. In fact, teens are behaving better \nthan grownups these days. The teen birth rate is down. It's twenty- \nand thirty somethings making stray dogs blush.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research group, has tried to \nsoften the implications of these strange tidings by reminding us that \nunwed motherhood doesn't necessarily mean no dad. Many of these \nwomen are living with a partner, according to a spokesperson for \nthe institute.\u0014\n\u0014\nAh, Mommy and Partner. So generic. So open-ended. So millennium. \nThe growth of mommies 'n' partners as a family substitute is being \nattributed to two cultural trends: the fact that women in their \nchild-bearing years aren't willing to rewind their bio-clocks while \nwaiting for the right dude to darken their door; and the more relaxed \nattitudes toward unwed mothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho's relaxed? I'm almost hysterical. As a mother of sons, I'm \nwondering whether my boys will ever find a woman willing to marry and \nraise a family.\u0014\n\u0014\nREMEMBER when guys suffered Fear of Commitment? Today, young women \nsuffer Contempt for Commitment. Gloria Steinhem' s maxim springs to \nmind: A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle. Women \ncome equipped with all the heavy machinery, after all. To the modern \nmaternal mind, a man's contribution is equivalent to a few drops of \noil.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is almost axiomatic in such a culture that if a woman doesn't need \na man, her children don't need a dad. Oh, the occasional \nsuperfeminist might concede that children need a father figure, but \nfew see the superior value of a wedded family over a partnering \narrangement. Divorce, after all, is almost inevitable. And then what? \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe this: male abstinence. Don't laugh. Dr. Gerald Rowles, a family \nconsultant- and psychologist, is suggesting exactly that on his \npro-family Web site (www.dadi.org). In a spinoff of Rudyard Kipling's \npoem, If, Rowles has created a new male credo: If you aspire to be \na man, father, husband, then you must exercise a man's unique freedom \nof Choice--abstinence.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nRowles calls abstinence a man's most powerful victory in the 'gender \nwars'  the conquest of his own body.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a world where women devalue men and fathers, where women hold the \nhigh cards in divorce and family-making decisions, it may have been \ninevitable that men would begin guarding their bodies and that which \nis uniquely their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as women once did.\u0014\n\u0014\nKathleen Parker,  tribune Media Services ~\u0014",

    "words": "Nov 17, 2000 - Richmond Times Dispatch   -- editorial\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunate Trend\u0014\n\u0014\nFashion has given the world many a dubious garment, from the corset \nto pre-stressed jeans. But a recent trend in teen-age girls' T-shirts \ncrosses the line from dubious to sinister.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Boys Are Great,\" one reads, \"Every Girl Should Own One.\" Another \nsays: \"I Make Boys Cry.\" A third shows the rear end of a donkey with \nthe legend, \"Boys Will Be Boys.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFemale assertiveness should be nurtured, especially among girls, whom \nresearch suggests show more reticence in the classroom when boys are \npresent. That is one reason Chicago has established an all-girl \npublic school, and why graduates of\u0014\nwomen's colleges tend to make strong leaders in business and \nacademia. Assertiveness, however, is not synonymous with acerbity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd boys have troubles of their own. Five out of six youth suicides \nare boys, and that proportion is rising. Boys do worse than girls in \nEnglish and social studies. They are less likely to graduate, to go \non to college, to stay out of jail. They are diagnosed with Attention \nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder far more often.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch comparisons can descend into a contest over who carries the \nheavier cross. The point here simply is that \"Boys Make Good Pets\" \nand \"So Many Boys, Such Little Minds\" T-shirts will exacerbate the \nproblems facing boys far more than they will elevate girls' \nself-esteem. (Even if they elevated self-esteem, the strategy seems \nakin to keeping one's head above water by\u0014\nstanding on a drowning person's shoulders.)\u0014\n\u0014\nDefenders of boy-bashing fashion say it simply responds to the \nHooters T-shirts occasionally seen on the street. Those shirts - \nwhile not exhibiting the most elevated conception of women - do not \nsend the same message of animosity. Like a copy of Playboy on the \ncoffee table, they label the wearer as one of those men proud to be \npowerlessly in thrall to his gender's strong\u0014\nappetite for visual stimulation. They identify him not as a \nmisogynist but as a clod.\u0014\n\u0014\nMisogyny, however, might be one result of the anti-boy shirts. It is \nhard to see a man developing warm personal friendships with women if \nhe spent his formative years being warned off from making friends \nwith girls. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis story can be found at : \nhttp://WWW.TiMeSDIspatch.com/editorial/mgbni0c3nfc.html\u0014",

The number of families \nheaded by single\u0014\n                        mothers has increased 25 percent since 1990, \nto more than 7.5\u0014\n                        million households. Contributing to the \nnumbers are a high rate of\u0014\n                        divorce and out-of-wedlock births. For most \nof the past decade,\u0014\n                        about a third of all babies were born to \nunmarried women,\u0014\n                        compared with 3.8 percent in 1940. \nDemographers now predict\u0014\n                        that more than half of the youngsters born in \nthe 1990s will spend\u0014\n                        at least part of their childhood in a \nsingle-parent home. The\u0014\n                        number of single fathers raising kids on \ntheir own is also up; they\u0014\n                        now head just over 2 million families.

It wouldnt \nhave been a\u0014\n                                                 good marriage, she \nsays. Its\u0014\n                                                 better for both of \nus this way,\u0014\n                        especially my son. Her steady salary meant \nshe had choices. I\u0014\n                        had an apartment, she says. I had a car. I \nfelt there was no\u0014\n                        reason why I shouldnt have the baby. I felt \nI could give it\u0014\n                        whatever it needed as far as love and support \nand I havent\u0014\n                        regretted it for even a minute since. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                For many women, the\u0014\n                        barrier to marriage may be that\u0014\n                        they care too much about it, not\u0014\n                        too little, and they want to get it\u0014\n                        right. If they cant find the perfect\u0014\n                        soulmate of their dreams, theyd\u0014\n                        rather stay single.

They take it seriously. Thats \nwhy theyre more\u0014\n                        likely to cohabit. They want to be sure \nbefore they take the\u0014\n                        ultimate step. The average age of first \nmarriage is now 25 for\u0014\n                        women and 27 for menup from 20 and 23 in \n1960. Thats the\u0014\n                        highest ever, which leaves plenty of time for \na live-in relationship to\u0014\n                        test a potential partners compatibility. \nToday its unusual if you\u0014\n                        dont live with someone before you marry \nthem, says Andrew\u0014\n                        Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. Before 1970,\u0014\n                        it wasnt respectable among anyone but the \npoor. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                        THEYRE NOT TRYING TO BE IMMORAL\u0014\n                               Some of these women are adult children \nof divorce who dont\u0014\n                        want to make their own offspring suffer the \npain of watching a\u0014\n                        parent leave. They see living together as a \nkind of trial marriage\u0014\n                        without the legal entanglements that make \nbreaking up so hard to\u0014\n                        doalthough research indicates that \ncohabiting couples dont\u0014\n                        have a much better track record. Theyre \ntrying to give their\u0014\n                        marriages a better chance, says Diane \nSollee, founder of the\u0014\n                        Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples \nEducation. Theyre\u0014\n                        not trying to be immoral and get away with \nsomething.\u0014\n                                And if the first (or the second) \nrelationship doesnt work out,\u0014\n                        many women think theres no reason to forgo \nmotherhood.\u0014\n                        Wellesley researcher Hertz has been studying \nmiddle-class single\u0014\n                        mothers older than 35. Most of the 60 women \nshe has interviewed\u0014\n                        in depth became pregnant accidentally. \nWhile their babies may\u0014\n                        have been unplanned, they were not unwanted. \nHertz says that for\u0014\n                        many of these women, the decision to become a \nmother was all\u0014\n                        about the modern version of settling. In \nthe old days a woman\u0014\n                        did that by marrying Mr. Almost Right. Now \nsettling means having\u0014\n                        the baby even if you cant get the husband. \nWhen I started this\u0014\n                        project in the mid-90s, Hertz says, these \nwomen were tough to\u0014\n                        find. Now theyre all overnext door, at the \nplayground, in your\u0014\n                        kids classroom. Theyve become a normal part \nof the terrain.\u0014\n                                Not all single mothers by choice wait \nfor a serendipitous\u0014\n                        pregnancy. There are so many options: sperm \nbanks, adoption.\u0014\n                        New Yorker Gail Janowitz, a market researcher \nin her mid-40s,\u0014\n                        decided to adopt two years ago. She always \nwanted to be a\u0014\n                        mother, but never married. As I got older, \nshe says, I didnt\u0014\n                        know if the timing of meeting a man was going \nto work out. I\u0014\n                        thought, well, Ill do the child part first. \nA year ago she adopted\u0014\n                        Rose, now 18 months old, in Kazakhstan. \nAlthough there have\u0014\n                        been difficult moments, Janowitz says she has \nno regrets. Ive\u0014\n                        never stopped knowing it was the right thing \nto do, she says. I\u0014\n                        think I will still have the opportunity or \nthe option, hopefully, to get\u0014\n                        married. But right now, I have a family. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                 A LONG, HARD JOURNEY\u0014\n                                                        Even under \nthe very best of\u0014\n                                                 conditions, single \nmotherhood is\u0014\n                                                 a long, hard journey \nfor both\u0014\n                                                 mother and children. \nNo one\u0014\n                                                 really knows the \nlong-term\u0014\n                                                 consequences for \nyoungsters\u0014\n                                                 who grow up in these \nnew\u0014\n                                                 varieties of \nsingle-parent and\u0014\n                                                 cohabiting homes. \nMuch of the\u0014\n                                                 research in the past \non\u0014\n                                                 alternative living \narrangements\u0014\n                                                 has concentrated on \nchildren of\u0014\n                        divorce, who face very different issues than \nyoungsters whose\u0014\n                        mothers have chosen to be single from the \nstart or are cohabiting\u0014\n                        with their childrens fathers or other \npartners.

    "words": "If there are Americans\u0014\n                       who wish to celebrate the Bible in America, I \nthink it might be good\u0014\n                       if they were educated as to just what horrors \nhave been based on\u0014\n                       it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Of course, any time the Bible is used to \njustify an action, a\u0014\n                       particular interpretation must be employed \n(after all, the Bible\u0014\n                       contains quite a number of broad, vague, and \neven contradictory\u0014\n                       statements). The problem arises when the \nperson refuses to\u0014\n                       recognize that they are using an \ninterpretation. Few Christian\u0014\n                       arguments annoy me quite so much as that \nsomeone's\u0014\n                       interpretation of the Bible is just \"common \nsense\" - and that thus\u0014\n                       anyone with a modicum of \"common sense\" will \nimmediately see\u0014\n                       what the Truth is and agree with them. In \nfact, it is rare that any\u0014\n                       interpretation of any text is really \"common \nsense.\" Either an\u0014\n                       interpretation can be objectively defended by \nappeal to text and\u0014\n                       context, or it cannot. Those who can will do \nso, and those who\u0014\n                       cannot will most likely refuse to admit it. \nOne of those issues\u0014\n                       which will appear to be \"common sense\" to the \naverage Christian\u0014\n                       will be the biblical position on slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Unfortunately, one of the most abominable \nchapters in the history\u0014\n                       of how the Bible has been used and interpreted \ninvolve the\u0014\n                       questions of race and slavery. Racial \nrelations, especially\u0014\n                       between whites and blacks, have long been \ndeplorable in the\u0014\n                       United States. They started out badly, got \nworse before they got\u0014\n                       better, and are nevertheless still poor with \nslim prospects of\u0014\n                       improving a great deal any time soon. Although \nChristians will be\u0014\n                       loathe to admit it, their religion shares a \nsignificant part of the\u0014\n                       blame for this situation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       People on all sides of racial and slavery \nissues have interpreted\u0014\n                       the Bible through the filters of their \npersonal and cultural\u0014\n                       assumptions - but at no point will you find \nthem admitting this. In\u0014\n                       every case people have seen their \ninterpretations as \"common\u0014\n                       sense\" - the only and obvious way Christians \nshould interpret\u0014\n                       their scriptures. The results will be the \nfocus of this week's article.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Old Testament\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The first, and most obvious, thing to remember \nis that there is no\u0014\n                       specific condemnation of slavery to be found \nanywhere in the\u0014\n                       Bible. At no point does God express even mild \ndisapproval of\u0014\n                       enslaving human beings, robbing them of what \nfreedom and\u0014\n                       independence they might have had. On the \ncontrary, God is\u0014\n                       depicted of both approving of and regulating \nslavery, ensuring\u0014\n                       that the traffic and ownership of fellow human \nbeings proceeds in\u0014\n                       an acceptable manner. In many cases, the \nregulations display a\u0014\n                       horrible disregard for the lives and dignity \nof enslaved individuals,\u0014\n                       hardly the sort of thing one would expect from \na loving God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Passages referencing and condoning slavery are \ncommon in the\u0014\n                       Old Testament. In one place, we read:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            When a slave owner strikes a male or \nfemale slave with a rod\u0014\n                            and the slave dies immediately, the owner \nshall be punished.\u0014\n                            But if the slave survives a day or two, \nthere is no punishment;\u0014\n                            for the slave is the owner's property. \n(Exod. 21:20-21)\u0014\n\u0014\n                       So, the immediate killing of a slave is \npunishable but a man may\u0014\n                       so grievously injure a slave that they die a \nfew days later from\u0014\n                       their wounds without facing any punishment or \nretribution. All\u0014\n                       societies in the Middle East at this time were \ncondoned slavery,\u0014\n                       so it shouldn't be surprising to find approval \nfor it in this\u0014\n                       document. As a human law, the above would be \ncommendable -\u0014\n                       after all, there was nothing quite so advanced \nanywhere else in\u0014\n                       the Middle East. But as the will of an all \nloving god, it's\u0014\n                       abominable.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       As a side note, it should be observed that the \nKing James Version\u0014\n                       of the Bible presents the above verse in an \naltered form,\u0014\n                       replacing \"slave\" with \"servant\" - thus \ngravely misleading\u0014\n                       Christians as to the intentions and desires of \ntheir God. One more\u0014\n                       reason to reject fundamentalist claims that \nthe KJV is the only true\u0014\n                       and valid translation!\u0014\n                      \u0014\n                       New Testament\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The New Testament, unfortunately, is little \nbetter. Jesus never\u0014\n                       even comes close to expressing disapproval of \nthe enslaving of\u0014\n                       other human beings, and many statements \nattributed to him\u0014\n                       reveal a tacit acceptance or even approval of \nthat inhuman\u0014\n                       institution. Throughout the Gospels we read \npassages like:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            A disciple is not above the teacher, nor \na slave above the\u0014\n                            master (Matt. 10:24)\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Who then is the faithful and wise slave, \nwhom his master has\u0014\n                            put in charge of his household, to give \nthe other slaves their\u0014\n                            allowance of food at the proper time? \nBlessed is that slave\u0014\n                            whom his master will find at work when he \narrives. (Matt.\u0014\n                            24:45-46)\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Although Jesus is using slavery in order to \nillustrate larger points,\u0014\n                       the question still remains why he would \ndirectly acknowledge the\u0014\n                       existence of slavery without saying anything \nnegative about it?\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The letters (rightly or wrongly) attributed to \nPaul are even worse,\u0014\n                       making it clear that the existence of slavery \nis not only\u0014\n                       acceptable, but that slaves themselves should \nnot presume to\u0014\n                       take the idea of freedom and equality preached \nby Jesus too far\u0014\n                       by attempting to escape their forced servitude.\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Let all who are under the yoke of slavery \nregard their masters\u0014\n                            as worthy of all honor, so that the name \nof God and the\u0014\n                            teaching may not be blasphemed. Those who \nhave believing\u0014\n                            masters must not be disrespectful to them \non the ground that\u0014\n                            they are members of the church; rather \nthey must serve them\u0014\n                            all the more, since those who benefit by \ntheir service are\u0014\n                            believers and beloved. Teach and urge \nthese duties.\u0014\n                            Whoever teaches otherwise and does not \nagree with the\u0014\n                            sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and \nthe teaching that\u0014\n                            is in accordance with godliness, is \nconceited, understanding\u0014\n                            nothing, and has a morbid craving for \ncontroversy and for\u0014\n                            disputes about words. From these come \nenvy, dissension,\u0014\n                            slander, base suspicions, and wrangling \namong those who\u0014\n                            are depraved in mind and bereft of the \ntruth, imagining that\u0014\n                            godliness is a means of gain. (1Tim. \n6:1-5)\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Slaves, obey your earthly masters with \nfear and trembling, in\u0014\n                            singleness of heart, as you obey Christ; \nnot only while being\u0014\n                            watched, and in order to please them, but \nas slaves of Christ,\u0014\n                            doing the will of God from the heart. \n(Eph. 6:5-6)\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Tell slaves to be submissive to their \nmasters and to give\u0014\n                            satisfaction in every respect; they are \nnot to talk back, not to\u0014\n                            pilfer, but to show complete and perfect \nfidelity, so that in\u0014\n                            everything they may be an ornament to the \ndoctrine of God\u0014\n                            our Savior. (Titus 2:9-10)\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Slaves, accept the authority of your \nmasters with all\u0014\n                            deference, not only those who are kind \nand gentle but also\u0014\n                            those who are harsh. For it is a credit \nto you if, being aware of\u0014\n                            God, you endure pain while suffering \nunjustly. If you endure\u0014\n                            when you are beaten for doing wrong, what \ncredit is that? But\u0014\n                            if you endure when you do right and \nsuffer for it, you have\u0014\n                            God's approval. (1Pet. 2:18-29)\u0014\n\u0014\n                       What are we to make of passages such as those \nquoted above?\u0014\n                       We must conclude that the author(s) did not \ndisapprove of the\u0014\n                       institution of slavery and probably regarded \nit as an appropriate\u0014\n                       part of society. Again, slavery was common in \nall contemporary\u0014\n                       societies, and it would be surprising to find \ncondemnation here.\u0014\n                       But if those authors were indeed divinely \ninspired, as is commonly\u0014\n                       thought by Christians, then we must conclude \nthat God's attitude\u0014\n                       towards slavery is not particularly negative. \nChristians are\u0014\n                       certainly not prohibited from owning slaves, \nand anyone who does\u0014\n                       not agree is directly condemned. There is, \nthen, no conflict\u0014\n                       between being a Christian and being an owner \nof other human\u0014\n                       beings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       No \"common sense\" interpretation can deny such \nthings without\u0014\n                       doing violence to the text itself, and nothing \ncan be criticized as\u0014\n                       having been \"taken out of context.\" Christians \nshould perhaps\u0014\n                       consider admitting that their Bible was \nwritten in a primitive,\u0014\n                       barbaric age and as such represents the \nprimitive, barbaric\u0014\n                       attitudes of that age.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Early Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\n                       How did the early Christians deal with the \nissue of slavery? There\u0014\n                       was almost universal approval of slavery among \nchurch leaders.\u0014\n                       Christians vigorously defended slavery (along \nwith other forms of\u0014\n                       extreme social stratification) as instituted \nby God and as being an\u0014\n                       integral part of the natural order of men. At \nall points, their\u0014\n                       reasoning was clearly and easily supported by \nthe Bible passages\u0014\n                       quoted above.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Let's allow them to tell us in their own words:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            The slave should be resigned to his lot, \nin obeying his\u0014\n                            master he is obeying God...

For example, through the late \n1700s, Reverend\u0014\n                       William Graham was rector and principle \ninstructor at the Liberty\u0014\n                       Hall Academy, now Washington and Lee \nUniversity in Lexington,\u0014\n                       Virginia. Every year, he lectured the senior \ngraduating class on\u0014\n                       the value of slavery and used the Bible in his \ndefense of it. For\u0014\n                       Graham and the many like him, Christianity was \nnot a tool for\u0014\n                       changing politics or social policy, but \ninstead to bring the\u0014\n                       message of salvation to everyone, regardless \nof their status of\u0014\n                       freedom. In this, they were certainly \nsupported by biblical text.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       As Kenneth Stamp wrote in The Peculiar \nInstitution, Christianity\u0014\n                       actually became a way to add value to slaves \nin America:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            ...when southern clergy became ardent \ndefenders of slavery,\u0014\n                            the master class could look upon \norganized religion as an\u0014\n                            ally ...the gospel, instead of becoming a \nmean of creating\u0014\n                            trouble and strive, was really the best \ninstrument to preserve\u0014\n                            peace and good conduct among the negroes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Through teaching slaves the message of the \nBible, they could be\u0014\n                       encouraged to bear the earthly burden in \nexchange for heavenly\u0014\n                       rewards later on - and they could be \nfrightened into believing that\u0014\n                       disobedience to earthly masters would be \nperceived by God as\u0014\n                       disobedience to Him. Ironically, enforced \nilliteracy prevented\u0014\n                       slaves from reading the Bible themselves. This \nis ironic because a\u0014\n                       similar situation existed in Europe during the \nMiddle Ages, as\u0014\n                       illiterate peasants and serfs were prevented \nfrom reading the\u0014\n                       Bible in their own language - a situation \nwhich was instrumental in\u0014\n                       the Protestant revolution. Now, Protestants \nwere doing much the\u0014\n                       same thing African slaves: using the authority \nof their Bible and\u0014\n                       the dogma of their religion to repress a group \nof people without\u0014\n                       even allowing them to read the basis of \nauthority on their own.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Division and Conflict\u0014\n\u0014\n                       As Northerners decried slavery and called for \nits abolition,\u0014\n                       southern political and religious leaders found \nan easy ally for their\u0014\n                       pro-slavery cause in the Bible and Christian \nhistory. In 1856\u0014\n                       Reverend Thomas Stringfellow, a Baptist \nminister from Culpepper\u0014\n                       County in Virginia, put the pro-slavery \nChristian message\u0014\n                       succinctly in his \"A Scriptural View of \nSlavery:\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                            ...Jesus Christ recognized this \ninstitution as one that was\u0014\n                            lawful among men, and regulated its \nrelative duties... I affirm\u0014\n                            then, first (and no man denies) that \nJesus Christ has not\u0014\n                            abolished slavery by a prohibitory \ncommand; and second, I\u0014\n                            affirm, he has introduced no new moral \nprinciple which can\u0014\n                            work its destruction...\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Of course, Christians in the North disagreed - \nand some\u0014\n                       denominations, like Quakers, appear to have \nnever been afflicted\u0014\n                       by slavery. Interestingly, most abolitionist \nattacks were based on\u0014\n                       the premise that the nature of Hebrew slavery \ndiffered in\u0014\n                       significant ways from the nature of slavery in \nthe American South.\u0014\n                       Although this was meant to argue that the \nAmerican form of\u0014\n                       slavery did not enjoy Biblical support, it \nnevertheless tacitly\u0014\n                       admitted that the institution of slavery did, \nin principle, have\u0014\n                       divine sanction and approval so long as \nconducted in an\u0014\n                       appropriate manner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       In the end, the North won on the question of \nslavery. Although the\u0014\n                       Southern Baptist Convention was formed in an \neffort to preserve\u0014\n                       the Christian basis for slavery before the \nstart of the Civil War,\u0014\n                       they did not feel it necessary to bother \napologizing until June\u0014\n                       1995. The reason was that even though the \nquestion of slavery\u0014\n                       had been settled, the question of race still \nburned.\u0014\n                        \u0014\n                       Repression and Superiority\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The later repression and discrimination \nagainst the freed black\u0014\n                       slaves received as much biblical and Christian \nsupport as the\u0014\n                       earlier institution of slavery itself. This \ndiscrimination and the\u0014\n                       choice to enslave blacks only was made \nprimarily on the basis of\u0014\n                       what has become known as the \"sin of Ham\" or \n\"the curse of\u0014\n                       Canaan.\" Occasionally there would also be \ndefenses of the\u0014\n                       inferiority of blacks by asserting that they \nbore the \"mark of Cain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                       We read in Genesis, chapter nine, that Noah's \nson Ham comes\u0014\n                       upon him sleeping off a drinking binge and \nsees his father naked.\u0014\n                       Instead of covering him, he runs and tells his \nbrothers. Shem and\u0014\n                       Japheth, the \"good\" brothers, return and cover \ntheir father. In\u0014\n                       retaliation for Ham's \"sinful act\" of seeing \nhis father nude, Noah\u0014\n                       puts a curse on his grandson (Ham's son) \nCanaan: ?Cursed be\u0014\n                       Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his \nbrothers\" (Gen 9:25).\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Over time, this curse came to be interpreted \nthat Ham was literally\u0014\n                       \"burnt,\" and that all his descendants had \nblack skin, marking them\u0014\n                       as slaves with a convenient color-coded label \nfor subservience.\u0014\n                       When and how this gained widespread acceptance \nis\u0014\n                       questionable, but anti-slavery religious and \npolitical leaders have\u0014\n                       worked to refute it for more than a century. \nToday, biblical\u0014\n                       scholars note that the ancient Hebrew word \n\"ham\" does not have\u0014\n                       to be translated as \"burnt\" or \"black\" - but \nthere is unfortunately\u0014\n                       little consensus on how the name and passage \nshould be\u0014\n                       interpreted. Further complicating matters is \nthe position of some\u0014\n                       Afrocentrists that Ham, although not actually \ncursed (despite what\u0014\n                       the Bible says!) was indeed black, as were \nmany other characters\u0014\n                       in the Bible. Once again, people end up \nreading the passage as\u0014\n                       supporting their own racial assumptions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Although many Christians today would be \nhorrified at using the\u0014\n                       Bible as a support for racism, they should \nrecognize that it was\u0014\n                       used in just such a fashion by Christians in \nAmerica in the same\u0014\n                       way and with the same justification as \nChristians today use the\u0014\n                       Bible in their defense of their favorite \nideas. Even as recently as\u0014\n                       the 1950's and 60's, Christians vehemently \nopposed\u0014\n                       desegregation or \"race-mixing\" for religious \nreasons. The \"curse\"\u0014\n                       of poor Ham lingered on in the minds of white \nChristians who\u0014\n                       fought to preserve a constant separation of \nthe races.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       A corollary to the inferiority of blacks has \nlong been the\u0014\n                       superiority of white Protestants - something \nwhich has not yet\u0014\n                       dissipated in America. Although \"Caucasians\" \nare not to be found\u0014\n                       anywhere in the Bible, that hasn't stopped \nmembers of Christian\u0014\n                       Identity groups from using the Bible to prove \nthat they are the true\u0014\n                       \"chosen people\" or \"true Israelites.\" This may \nseem bizarre, but it\u0014\n                       has long been popular among American \nProtestants to see\u0014\n                       themselves as being \"divinely appointed\" to \ntame the American\u0014\n                       wilderness despite the \"demon Indians.\" \nAmericans are supposed\u0014\n                       to be blessed with a special destiny by God, \nand many read an\u0014\n                       American role in Armageddon in the book of \nRevelations. I am\u0014\n                       ever amazed at the degree to which \nChristianity encourages\u0014\n                       extreme egotism and inflated sense of \nself-importance or\u0014\n                       personal destiny.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Christian Identity is just a new kid on the \nblock of White Protestant\u0014\n                       Supremacy - the earliest such group was the \ninfamous Ku Klux\u0014\n                       Klan. Too few people realize that the KKK was \nfounded as a\u0014\n                       Christian organization and still sees itself \nin terms of defending\u0014\n                       true Christianity. Especially in the earliest \ndays, Klansmen openly\u0014\n                       recruited in churches (white and segregated, \nof course),\u0014\n                       attracting members from all strata of society, \nincluding the clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Although Klan ceremonies have varied greatly, \none common form\u0014\n                       will include an American flag, a cross, and a \nBible opened to\u0014\n                       Romans 12, exhorting Christians to \"godly \nconduct, godly nature.\"\u0014\n                       Also common is a sword representing the war \nagainst all enemies\u0014\n                       of the Christian life an the American \n\"Christian Nation.\" Opening\u0014\n                       and closing prayers may often include \"The \nliving Christ is a\u0014\n                       Klansman's criterion of character.\" The origin \nof a burning cross\u0014\n                       is unclear - it may stem from the ancient \nScottish tradition of\u0014\n                       burning a cross on a hill to call together the \nclans, or it may be\u0014\n                       representative of spreading the light of the \nTrue Cross in an effort\u0014\n                       to promote Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Interpretation and Apologetics\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The cultural and personal assumptions of the \npro-slavery\u0014\n                       Christians (and pro-slavery biblical authors) \nquoted above are\u0014\n                       probably obvious to all of us now, but I doubt \nthat they were\u0014\n                       obvious to slavery supporters at the time. \nSimilarly, today, I'm\u0014\n                       sure that few people are aware of the cultural \nand personal\u0014\n                       baggage which they bring to their readings. \nThey assume the\u0014\n                       truth of what they believe, and are determined \nto find divine\u0014\n                       sanction for their beliefs in their holy book. \nI think that these\u0014\n                       Christians would be better off defending their \nideas on their own\u0014\n                       merits, but I quite honestly doubt they are \ncapable of it. Perhaps\u0014\n                       they doubt themselves too, and that's why they \ndon't try.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       My recommendation is against ever accepting \nany sort of\u0014\n                       \"common sense\" defense of any biblical \ninterpretation.\u0014\n                       Throughout history, the idea that someone's \ninterpretation is just\u0014\n                       \"common sense\" has been used on every side of \nevery issue,\u0014\n                       including today's topic of slavery. Defense of \nan interpretation\u0014\n                       can only be done via rational, logical \nargument. Unfortunately for\u0014\n                       Christians, that has been used effectively on \nevery side of every\u0014\n                       issue, too - including today's topic of \nslavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Maybe that means that using the Bible isn't a \nvalid defense of an\u0014\n                       idea?

    "words": "An Episcopalian Experiment \u0014\nUnorthodox Ministry Invites the Alienated Back to Church \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Susan DeFord\u0014\nWashington Post Staff Writer\u0014\nThursday, October 18, 2001; Page HO06 \u0014\n\u0014\nHarry Brunett and Chuck Donofrio remember when they felt that church \nwas worthless. Brunett left the Episcopal\u0014\nChurch as a young minister in 1965 because it seemed irrelevant to \nthe civil rights struggle. Donofrio grew up\u0014\nsinging in an Episcopal boys' choir in downtown Baltimore, but he \nnever considered himself a Christian and dropped\u0014\nout of church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter spending years in community organization, Brunett returned to \nministry in 1992 as pastor of St. Andrew's\u0014\nEpiscopal Church, a growing parish in western Howard County.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonofrio also came back to the fold. But the two men retained a \nprofound sense of their earlier alienation, which\u0014\nthey are now using to shape an unorthodox ministry in Howard.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo reach people who never enter a sanctuary, Brunett and Donofrio \nhave used market research and focus groups,\u0014\nand have designed weekly services that, among other things, \ndeliberately de-emphasize Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The sad fact is the name of Jesus Christ has become for many people \nexclusionary,\" said Donofrio, president and\u0014\nCEO of a Baltimore marketing and public relations firm. \"Many people \nexperience using Jesus almost as a bludgeon\u0014\nto beat them into submission.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis effort to arouse the alienated has the backing and financial \nsupport of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland and\u0014\nthe keen interest of its bishop, the Rev. Robert Wilkes Ihloff.\u0014\n\u0014\nTypical Christian evangelism, Ihloff said, \"has been a turnoff for \npeople. This is really kind of experimental. What you\u0014\nhave, in effect, is a dialogue with unchurched people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBrunett and Donofrio teamed up in 1998, when Donofrio was giving \ntalks to Maryland Episcopal clergy about\u0014\nmarketing the church. After two years of research and planning, and a \nyear of experimental services, weekly\u0014\ngatherings began last month at Clemens Crossing Elementary School in \nColumbia.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo far, the services have drawn a small crowd of about two dozen. The \neffort includes a newly launched Web site,\u0014\nwww.journeyscommunity.org.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the small turnout so far, ministry members think there is a \nwide audience for their message. According to\u0014\nrecent research, only 20 percent of Americans regularly attend \nchurch, not the 40 percent that pollsters have\u0014\nreported for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main Protestant denominations have declined from a high of 30 \nmillion in 1965 to 22 million in 1995, according\u0014\nto the Hartford Institute for Religious Research. Episcopalians have \nmirrored that decline, from 3.4 million to 2.5\u0014\nmillion during the same period.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn blunt business terms, mainline churches are losing market share \neven as their potential audience grows larger.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It took at least a decade before churches acknowledged, 'This is a \nreal trend, and we've got to do something about\u0014\nthis,' \" said Scott L. Thumma, a Hartford Institute researcher.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome have succeeded by shedding hymnals and pews for contemporary \n\"seeker services\" -- so named for people\u0014\nwho wanted a spiritual dimension but were not attracted to a \ntraditional church.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst developed 26 years ago by a suburban Chicago church, these \nservices, which feature popular music and\u0014\nmultimedia presentations, are offered at dozens of Washington-area \nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Maryland Episcopal diocese, which covers most of the state \nbeyond suburban Washington, the bishop is\u0014\nsupporting such outreach even in a denomination that venerates \ntradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years ago, Ihloff defended the provocative -- some said \nsacrilegious -- television and newspaper advertising\u0014\nby a Frederick County Episcopal church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore recently, he helped direct $40,000 from the diocese to Brunett's \neffort. The ministry attracted an additional\u0014\n$55,000 from private and Episcopal church foundations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To really reach unchurched people, we're going to have to develop a \nnew style of being churched,\" Ihloff said.\u0014\n\"That's not historically different from how Christianity operated in \nthe early days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDonofrio's research has revealed that many people are exposed to \nformal religion as children, reject it and then\u0014\nbecome spiritually curious as adults. At that point, say outreach \nministry members, people want to ask questions, not\u0014\nlisten to answers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're enabling people to discover God themselves, maybe through \nJesus, maybe through Buddha, maybe through\u0014\nany number of ways,\" Brunett said. \"It's not a back-door way to catch \npeople and bring them to the Episcopal\u0014\nChurch.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, St. Andrew's officials aren't counting on new faces in their \npews.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We don't see it necessarily as a direct benefit to us,\" said Peter \nRadue, the senior warden of St. Andrew's vestry, its\u0014\ngoverning board. \"Ministry shouldn't be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the services, the writings of Saint Benedict and Zen master \nThich Nhat Hanh have equal exposure, along with\u0014\ncountry singer Willie Nelson's tune \"On The Road Again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are meditation and movie clips, elements of Judaism and even \n12-step programs for substance abusers. The\u0014\nservices are designed by a ministry team that includes not only \nBrunett and Donofrio, but also a psychologist and a\u0014\nBaltimore fiction writer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can relate to a movie clip more readily than I relate to the \nBible,\" said writer Jennifer Grow, a member of the\u0014\nministry team. \"If things [in the service] are only Christian, I \nwould have a hard time with this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut officials with the Episcopal Church's national offices in New \nYork City weren't sure how the ministry fits with the\u0014\ndenomination's mission.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is so radically different, some would see it as a repudiation of \nthe basic tenets of the Episcopal Church, which is a\u0014\ncommunity gathered around for the story, Jesus's story,\" said James \nSolheim, director of the Episcopal Church's\u0014\noffice of news and information. \"I haven't heard of anything like \nthis since the '60s.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rev. Melford \"Bud\" Holland, national coordinator for the \nEpiscopal Church's ministry development, said seeker\u0014\nministries shouldn't be preachy, but at some point they need to make \ntheir pitch for Christianity. \"That's who we are,\"\u0014\nhe said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome who have visited these small gatherings in Columbia prefer the \npotpourri of spiritual exercises.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I like the intent of people coming together to seek something -- not \nhaving the answers is a nice part of it,\" said\u0014\nSheila Campbell, who grew up in a Southern Baptist family and now is \na member of a Unitarian Universalist Church in\u0014\nWashington. \"You can give yourself over to the moment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMichele Consentini traveled from Carroll County last spring to try \nthe experimental services. She enjoyed the small\u0014\ngroup discussions and Brunett's informal talk about namaste, a \nSanskrit word meaning, \"I bow to the divine in you.\"\u0014\nHindus greet each other with the expression, which urges people to \nrecognize God in others.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was an idea, Consentini said, that reverberated days later when a \ncasual acquaintance unexpectedly helped her\u0014\ncope with her disabled son.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For me, it's the message and what you are going to take away and \nincorporate into your daily life,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, this woman who grew up in a nonreligious family, who felt out of \nplace in a traditional church, stands before the\u0014\nmicrophone each Sunday and sings for the gathering. She is a new \nmember of the ministry team.\u0014\n\u0014\n                               2001 The Washington Post Company\u0014",

    "title": "UNDERSTANDING ISLAM'S IDEOLOGY AND WORLDVIEW",
    "words": "Understanding Islam's Ideology and Worldview\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Colson Commentary\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans are confused about how Islam -- a religion that we've been\u0014\ntold is known for peace and morality -- can spawn the vicious murder \nof\u0014\ninnocents in the name of God. The key to understanding those who\u0014\ncommitted the atrocities in New York and Washington, and those who\u0014\nsupported them, has to do with the Islamic worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor most Muslims in America, Islam is simply a religion. Muslims\u0014\nbelieve in the six articles of Islam and practice the required \"Acts \nof\u0014\nWorship\" which include prayer five times a day, fasting through the\u0014\nmonth of Ramadan, and, if possible, a pilgrimage to Mecca, where\u0014\nMuhammad founded the religion in A.D. 622.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is, however, another aspect of Islam that many seem reluctant to\u0014\nacknowledge. Islam is more than a religion: It is an ideology with a\u0014\nclear sociopolitical agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Dr. Samuel Schlorff, an expert on Islam with Arab World Ministries\u0014\nputs it, \"The truth is that there is another side to Islam, a side \nthat\u0014\nembraces violence 'in the way of Allah.' . . . It holds that all men\u0014\nare created to live in submission to Allah, as prescribed by Islamic\u0014\nlaw. Muslims believe that Islam's destiny is to extend its control\u0014\nuntil the whole Dar al-Harb [which means \"House of War\" -- that is, \nthe\u0014\nwhole non-Muslim world] is subject to Islamic law in an Islamic state,\u0014\nand this includes the use of force.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam, we've been told, is related to the Arabic word meaning \"peace.\"\u0014\nThis is correct, except that the word means a particular kind of \npeace.\u0014\nA better translation is \"surrender\" or \"submission.\" It describes the\u0014\npeace when a vanquished soldier lays down his arms in submission. And\u0014\nso the very name, Islam, has militaristic connotations, and in this\u0014\nlies the root of radical Islam. That root then grows in the soil of \nthe\u0014\nIslamic worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuslims view God, Allah, as absolutely transcendent. While Christians\u0014\nunderstand that the Lord God reveals himself through the Scriptures \nand\u0014\npreeminently in the Incarnation, Muslims insist that Allah never\u0014\nreveals himself in that way. He primarily reveals his will.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuslims also believe in the inherent goodness of people as over \nagainst\u0014\nthe Christian doctrine of original sin. Christians understand that we\u0014\nare incapable of following God's law and are thus in need of \nsalvation,\u0014\na fundamental difference. Muslims believe that we don't need \nsalvation.\u0014\nWhat we need is guidance and that guidance is the Islamic law, an all\u0014\nencompassing system that controls every aspect of everyday life. (It \nis\u0014\nadministered, by the way, by religious leaders.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Dr. Schlorff puts it, \"The model requires a Muslim government to\u0014\nprovide the legal and social framework necessary to facilitate\u0014\nsubmission to the law. There is no separation between the sacred and\u0014\nthe secular, between church and state. This community is one,\u0014\nuniversal, and cohesive, representing for Muslims the kingdom of God \non\u0014\nearth.\" And all people of earth are called to submit, for based on \nthis\u0014\nworldview, any who do not submit are living sub-human lives and are\u0014\nimpeding Islam's utopian vision for the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians certainly talk about submitting to God, but we do not mean\u0014\nwhat Muslims mean. Now all Christians should respect law-abiding\u0014\nMuslims in this country. But we also should understand our \ndifferences.\u0014\nIt is all in the worldview, and our differences are very great.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor further reading:\u0014\n\u0014\nDr Samuel Schlorff, \"Can you explain for me the Mindset of the Islamic\u0014\nTerrorist?\" Arab World Ministries, 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr Samuel Schlorff, \"Muslim Ideology and Christian Apologetics,\"\u0014\nMissiology, Vol. 21, No. 2 (April 1993).\u0014\nislam.org/Christians/schlorff2.html>\u0014",

    "words": "Monday, Oct. 22, 2001 TIME\u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. Intelligence: Let the Finger-Pointing Begin\u0014\nReeling from the September 11th terrorist attacks, lawmakers are \naccusing the\u0014\nintelligence community of a spectacular lapse. What changes can we \nexpect?\u0014\nBY JESSICA REAVES\u0014\n\u0014\nPeacetime in Washington is over. Caught up in a period of national \nmourning,\u0014\nlegislators have spent the last several weeks in a state of \nself-imposed silence,\u0014\nreluctant to cast blame for or even ask many questions about the \nSeptember\u0014\n11th attacks. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo longer. Sunday, during consecutive appearances on NBCs \"Meet the\u0014\nPress,\" Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman urged the White House \nto\u0014\nappoint a blue-ribbon panel to investigate the intelligence lapses \nleading up to\u0014\nthe September 11th attacks. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe panels, McCain and Lieberman agreed, would be formed in the \nspirit of the\u0014\nWarren Commission, which investigated President Kennedys \nassassination,\u0014\nand the Roberts Commission, which scrutinized the intelligence \nfailure that led\u0014\nto the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, across Capitol Hill, the House has already established a \ncommittee to investigate\u0014\nwhat failures may have contributed to Septembers terrorist attacks. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe inquiries, lawmakers warn, could stretch on for months, even \nyears, before any conclusions\u0014\ncan be drawn. Until that day, U.S. intelligence will continue its \nwork  but under what conditions, and by whose rules? In search of \nanswers,TIME.com spoke with Steve Cimbala, professor of political \nscience at Penn State University and an expert on U.S. national \nsecurity and defense. Cimbala has also served as a consultant to \nnumerous government agencies. \u0014\n\u0014\nTIME.com: What kind of response can we expect from the intelligence \ncommunity in\u0014\nthe wake of the September 11th attacks? Professor Cimbala:The U.S. \ngovernment does\u0014\ntwo things when confronted with a crisis: One, it reorganizes itself; \nand two, it throws a lot of\u0014\nmoney at things and hopes something will change. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the current, very unfamiliar situation, theres little doubt about \nwhether to proceed with an\u0014\ninvestigation. Do we need to investigate our colossal intelligence \nfailures that led to\u0014\nSeptember 11th? Of course we do, But this shouldnt be just a blame \nrain dance, where the\u0014\nBeltway types just move the same problems from one box into another. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe real issue here is the mindset of the intelligence community  \nmore specifically, the\u0014\nmindset of the post-cold war intelligence community, which I would \ncharacterize\u0014\nas juridical complacency. In other words, a mentality that forced \nintelligence\u0014\nagents to ask how well an action or appointment will stand up in a \ncommittee, or\u0014\nhow it will look on paper. Thats opposed to the more archaic \nmindset, which\u0014\nwas, who are the bad guys and how do we find them? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second problem the government needs to confront is that the worst \nfailure\u0014\nwas in counterintelligence. The ideal philosophy in \ncounterintelligence is, \"We\u0014\npresume there are bad guys who are out to get us and we need to \nfigure out\u0014\nhow to stop them.\" Unfortunately, thats not evident anywhere in the \nintelligence\u0014\ncommunity right now, except perhaps in the cyber-terrorism \nsubsections. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you look at what happened in September, youll see the terrorists \ndid\u0014\nbrilliantly in finding and exploiting the weak spots in our \ncounterintelligence.\u0014\nThose failings, unfortunately, run the gamut. Ive been told, for \nexample, that\u0014\nthroughout the 1990s people on terrorist watch lists were just \nwandering back\u0014\nand forth across the Canadian border like cockroaches. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvents in the recent past really should have clued us in to the \nproblems in our\u0014\ncounterintelligence measures; the Robert Hanssen case, for example.\u0014\nApparently, no one took serious notice. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow enthusiastic will lawmakers be about an investigation? \u0014\n\u0014\nLawmakers will all want what I call investigative photoops. Everyone \nwill talk\u0014\nabout wanting to clean this up, but the truth that no one should \nforget is that\u0014\nCongress shares a lot of the blame for the intelligence communitys \nlapses. It\u0014\nwas Congress, after all, that imposed all sorts of legal restrictions \nthat made\u0014\ninvestigations much more difficult. And it was Congress, of course, \nthat cut the\u0014\nbudget for intelligence communities. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs CIA director George Tenet in trouble? Alabama Senator Richard\u0014\nShelby, for one, is lobbying for the CIA directors removal, telling\u0014\nreporters last week, \"I believe there have been too many failures on\u0014\nhis watch.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI dont think Tenet will last. Mueller will be okay because hes new. \nI dont think\u0014\nthats necessarily fair  this was a system-wide failure. But its \njust the way\u0014\nthings work. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Bay of Pigs fiasco, JFK said to then-CIA director Allen \nDulles, \"If this\u0014\nwere a parliamentary system, Id have to resign. But its not  and \nthat means\u0014\nyou do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWill we see an increase in the intelligence budget? \u0014\n\u0014\nWe probably will, but that doesnt necessarily mean well see better \nresults. We\u0014\nneed human intelligence, not high-tech gadgets. We need more case \nofficers\u0014\ntrained in relevant languages and customs of the Milddle East and \nAsia. And\u0014\nfrankly, we need good old espionage. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres been a lot of talk about interagency competition between the\u0014\nFBI and the CIA. Could those tensions cause problems in an\u0014\ninvestigation? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe FBI and CIA have a history of being very competitive and not \nsharing data,\u0014\nand I think thats the number one issue for Homeland Security \nDirector Tom\u0014\nRidge. Hes got to get the FBI and CIA talking to one another in a \nmore open,\u0014\npublic way. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is about a culture clash, more than anything. The FBI is about \ngathering\u0014\nevidence for a criminal prosecution that will stand up in court, \nwhile the CIA is\u0014\nabout gathering information about foreign intelligence any way they \ncan, using\u0014\nall techniques at their disposal. Their cultures are so different, \nwhich makes it\u0014\ntough to share information. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat being said, I do think we can look for real progress in this \narea over the\u0014\nnext few years, simply because the need for change in both agencies \nis so\u0014\nself-evident.\u0014",

The \"magic\u0014\n      dragon\" was supposed to be the marijuana, which, of course,\u0014\n      you \"puff\" on. We bought into this secret meaning because\u0014\n      it was not unlike contemporary musicians to hide\u0014\n      countercultural messages in their songs. That, to us, was\u0014\n      what the song meant.\u0014\n\u0014\n      But is that really what the song meant?\u0014\n\u0014\n      Peter, Paul, and Mary had a 30year reunion tour. Late in\u0014\n      the program, Peter Yarrow was about to lead the audience in\u0014\n      singing \"Puff,\" which had since become a popular American\u0014\n      folk song. But he prefaced the song with a comment: \"Many\u0014\n      people thought this song was about drugs. But it never was.\u0014\n      It was a simple song about a boy and his dragon, and the\u0014\n      sorrows of leaving boyhood. I know. I'm Puff's daddy.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Unholy Crisis\u0014\n                                  After more sex-abuse scandals, \nwhat's next for the Catholic Church? \u0014\nBY JEFFERY SHELER \u0014\n\u0014\nA sex-abuse scandal that has hounded the Roman Catholic Church for \nyears grew deeper and wider last week as disturbing new details of \npedophile priests and complicit church officials emerged in \nMassachusetts, Arizona, and elsewhere. The worsening scandal and a \nresulting proliferation of punishing lawsuits and costly legal \nsettlements threaten to take an increasingly heavy toll on the \nchurch's finances and its already tarnished public image. More than \nthat, it could further erode confidence within the church itself, \nchallenging the ability of embattled church leaders to speak with a \ncredible moral voice to their own flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe latest revelations came in court records unsealed in mid-January \nin the case of John Geoghan, a former parish priest convicted last \nmonth of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy a decade ago. The \nrecords, obtained and first reported by the Boston Globe, depict the \nloathsome deeds of a sexual predator who allegedly preyed on more \nthan 100 innocent children over three decades. The church already has \npaid more than $10 million to settle 50 civil lawsuits against \nGeoghan alone, who faces a second criminal trial later this month on \ncharges of raping a 7-year-old. And last week, an examination of \ncourt records by the Globe revealed that the Boston archdiocese has \nquietly settled child sex-abuse claims against at least 70 other \npriests in the past 10 years. The size of those secret payouts is \nunknown. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbuse and power. No less troubling was the behavior, depicted in \ncourt records, of church leaders who could have stopped the abuse but \ndidn't. Instead, they quietly shuttled the predatory priest from \nparish to parish where he continued to prey on children. Geoghan \nwasn't even defrocked until 1998. Last month, Cardinal Bernard Law \napologized for failing to stop Geoghan sooner and promised that the \ndiocese would begin reporting to civil authorities all allegations of \nchild sex abuse, both past and future. Law has rejected calls for his \nown resignation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoston is not the only place where the Catholic Church faces a \nworsening sex-abuse crisis. In Tucson last week, the Roman Catholic \ndiocese settled a case against four priests accused of molesting nine \naltar boys and another youth in the 1970s. Terms of the settlement \nwere not disclosed but reportedly was in the millions of dollars. In \na letter to his parishioners, Tucson Bishop Manuel D. Moreno said the \npayout would have \"very painful consequences\" for the diocese, \ncausing it to go further into debt. Moreno also planned to send \npersonal apologies to each of the victims. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland agreed last week to \npay $110 million to settle cases involving hundreds of people who \nclaim they were sexually abused as children by priests, nuns, and \nother church officials over several decades. Many of the incidents \nare said to have occurred at state-funded, church-run schools. In \nexchange for the settlement, the government agreed to indemnify the \nchurch against further legal action by sex-abuse victims in Ireland.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were just the latest in a string of cases that have emerged \nsince the late 1980s. Exactly how large the problem has become is \ndifficult to judge. There is no official tally of victims and \nabusers, and the church says it doesn't keep track. And while some \nbig settlements have been made public--a $120 million jury award in \nDallas in 1997 that later was reduced to $23 million and a $5.2 \nmillion award in Los Angeles late last year--many lawsuits are \nsettled out of court with details kept confidential.\u0014\nBut lawyers and sex-abuse experts familiar with many of the cases say \nthose that have been made public represent only a small fraction. \nSome have estimated that the scandal to date has involved more than \n3,000 priests and tens of thousands of victims. At least one noted \nexpert, A. W. Richard Sipe, a retired psychotherapist and author of \nSex, Priests, and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis, estimates that since \nthe late 1980s, the church has paid out close to $1 billion in \nsettlements and legal and other expenses. Church officials say that \nfigure is exaggerated. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the huge financial strain the settlements are creating, some \nchurch analysts say the scandal has exposed deep fissures in the \nchurch's governing structure, revealing a bureaucracy unable--or \nunwilling--to keep discipline within its own ranks. After a flurry of \ndamaging lawsuits in the early 1990s, U.S. bishops rushed to set \ntough standards to root out pedophile priests and help sex-abuse \nvictims. Most of the nation's 188 dioceses adopted stricter \nguidelines. But enforcement of those standards was largely left to \ndiocesan bishops, and some were more aggressive than others. As a \nresult \"enforcement has been spotty at best,\" notes Jason Berry, \nwhose 1992 book, Lead Us Not Into Temptation: Catholic Priests and \nthe Sexual Abuse of Children, first brought the widening scandal into \nnational focus. Exacerbating the problem, Berry says, has been \"the \ntotal lack of leadership from the Vatican on this issue . . . . They \ndon't want to get near it, or if they do, it's in secret.\" A new \nVatican policy quietly circulated to bishops last summer requires \nchurch authorities to swiftly inform the Holy See of sex-abuse \nallegations. But it also declared the cases subject to secret \ninternal proceedings, prompting some to argue that the new rules \nwould erode rather than build trust in the church. \u0014\nTrouble everywhere. While recent cases have focused on Catholic \nclergy, virtually every religious denomination has had its scandals. \nOver the past decade, reports of sexual misdeeds by clergy have cut \nacross the religious landscape, from Protestant and Mormon churches \nto Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist congregations. One nationwide survey \nfound that 1 in 4 members of the clergy reported having had some kind \nof sexual contact with someone other than their spouse, and more than \n1 in 10 said they had committed adultery. Another recent nationwide \nstudy found that nearly 90 percent of pastoral counselors have had \nclients report incidents of clergy sexual abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nConfronted by the current rash of publicity and lawsuits, several \nProtestant denominations have implemented policies in recent years to \ndeal with sexual abusers. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, \nthe Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United \nMethodist Church, and the United Church of Christ all have reworked \nor implemented policies to identify sexual abuse and harassment and \nto spell out procedures for removing offending pastors. Most of the \nnation's 188 Roman Catholic dioceses also have revised policies in \nline with a call by U.S. bishops in the mid-1990s to \"break this \ncycle of abuse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether any of this will work, of course, remains to be seen. \"Sexual \nabuse is still occurring, and the recycling of abusers is still \noccuring,\" says David Clohessy, national director of Survivors \nNetwork of Those Abused by Priests, a nationwide support group. But \nwith jury awards and settlements mounting, and church finances and \nreputations increasingly at risk, there are powerful incentives for \nthe nation's churches to put their houses in order. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith Justin Ewers\u0014",

    "words": "Apr 25, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\nUniverse age: 13 billion years - plus\u0014\n\u0014\nBY A.J. HOSTETLER\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers double-checking the \nbirth certificate of dying stars confirm the age of the universe at \njust under 14 billion years.\u0014\n\u0014\nScientists \"carded\" the universe by creating a cosmic clock to \nmeasure the ages of white dwarfs, those cooling embers of burnt-out \nstars that can be eight times the size of our sun. The Hubble's \ncameras zeroed in on a somewhat nearby but very faint cluster of white\u0014\ndwarfs located about 7,000 light-years away in the constellation \nScorpius.\u0014\n\u0014\nCooler stars are older, and white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, \nsaid team member Harvey Richer of the University of British Columbia. \nThat makes the dim stars a great timer by which to independently \ngauge the age of other objects, such as the universe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's like finding a birth certificate,\" said Bruce Margon of the \nSpace Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which manages the \nHubble for NASA. The space agency announced the findings yesterday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new work confirms by a different method the age calculated about \nfive years ago by astronomers examining how fast the universe is \nexpanding.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The fact that we're in the same ball- park says something\" about the \nstrength of the conclusions, said astronomer Wendy Freedman of the \nCarnegie\u0014\nObservatories in Pasadena, Calif., who led the expansion-rate \ncalculation research in 1997.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trick for Richer's team was to find the faintest, most ancient \nwhite dwarfs and snap their picture with very long exposures. This \nrequired focusing the Hubble on the cluster for eight days over a \n67-day period to allow even fainter dwarfs to become visible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cluster, called M4, and other old star clusters are thought to \nhave formed the original Milky Way galaxy. Globular clusters contain \nhundreds of thousands of stars and are among the oldest clusters of \nstars in the universe.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce they found the faintest, and thus the oldest, of white dwarfs in \nthe cluster, Richer and his colleagues \"took\" their temperature and \ncalculated their birth date: about 12 billion to 13 billion years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, they added to that a billion years that the Hubble previously \nestimated it takes for such star clusters to form. That leads to the \nestimation that the Big Bang jump-started the universe some 14 \nbillion years ago, give or take a half-billion years.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past century, astronomers have tussled over the age of the \nuniverse. In 1928, Edwin Hubble concluded that the universe was \nuniformly expanding, which meant the universe had an age that could \nbe determined by mathematically \"running the expansion backward\" \nbased on that uniform rate. He first estimated the universe was only \n2 billion years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater studies gave an estimate of about 9 billion years for the \nuniverse age, which created a problem because some stars were known \nto be older.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1997, Freedman and other astronomers using the Hubble telescope \nand ground-based observatories discovered the universe was not \nexpanding at a constant rate, but accelerating, due to an unknown \nforce called \"dark energy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen dark energy is factored into the expansion, the age of the \nuniverse measures 13 billion to 14 billion years. That age is now \nindependently verified by the ages of the \"clockwork\" white dwarfs \nmeasured recently by Hubble.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hubble's \"snapshots\" of the white dwarf cluster were taken before \nthe installation of new camera equipment on the telescope earlier \nthis year by space shuttle astronauts. Richer said the same research \nteam hopes to use the new equipment to date another, similar dwarf \ncluster to verify its findings.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaunched 12 years ago, the Hubble telescope orbits some 375 miles \nabove Earth, using powerful optical instruments to provide stunning \nviews of the cosmos that cannot be made using ground-based \ntelescopes. The latest images from the Hubble's recently upgraded \ncameras are to be released next month.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nContact A.J.

    "title": "UKROP'S CEO WALKS THE TALK",
    "words": "Ukrop's CEO Walks the Ethics Talk\u0014\nBY David Wilkinson \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians would say the Golden Rule--treating others as you \nwish to be treated--is a good way to live.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Virginia food store executive Bobby Ukrop and his family, it's \nalso a good way to do business.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Ukrop's Super Markets, a chain of 28 stores scattered across \ncentral Virginia, the Golden Rule is incorporated into the company's \nmission: \"to serve our customers and community efficiently and \neffectively while treating our customers, associates, and suppliers \nas we personally like to be treated.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ukrop family's commitment to Christian principles is also \nreflected in the company's daily business practices. Alongside \nfamiliar core values such as \"superior customer service,\" \"superior \nquality and freshness\" and \"cost consciousness\" is a commitment to \n\"honesty and fairness: acting openly, equitably and consistently in \nall we do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a time when corporate scandals have fueled Americans' skepticism \nabout such lofty language, Ukrop recognizes that belief must be \nbacked by behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our shared values are very important to us,\" he told \nEthicsDaily.com, \"but our words have to be consistent with our \nactions. We need to 'walk the talk.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's very important that I practice what I preach,\" added the \ncompany's president and CEO, \"whether it's picking up trash in the \nparking lot or trying to set a good example by how I speak to a \ncustomer or an associate. We try to model the behavior we're desiring \nin our associates.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChief among Ukrop's own role models--for his business and for his \nlife--were his parents: \"In their souls, they believed serving others \nwas the noble thing to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUkrop's stores are closed on Sundays, do not sell alcohol or tabloid \nnewspapers, and donate 10 percent of pre-tax profits to charity. Yet \nthe company has earned the food store industry's largest market share \nin central Virginia since 1985. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Being closed on Sundays means we have to be better (than the \ncompetition),\" Ukrop said with a chuckle, \"and I like that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe company has thrived in an era when family businesses are becoming \nan endangered species. Ukrop's father opened the first store in 1937; \nhis brother Jim, now Ukrop's chairman, talked their father into \nopening a second store in 1963, the first step in a carefully \ndesigned expansion plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong the way, Ukrop's has earned a widespread reputation for its \ncommitment to quality service, innovative practices and the welfare \nof its employees. For each of the past three years, it has been \nlisted in Fortune magazine's \"100 Best Companies to Work For.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith competitive wages and benefits and a hospitable work \nenvironment, Ukrop's employee retention ranks consistently higher \nthan industry standards. The company's annual picnic resembles a big \nfamily reunion. Last year, a $1,500, interest-free loan was made \navailable to all employees wanting to purchase a computer, with \npayments processed through payroll deduction. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We try to treat people right, to value them, respect them,\" said \nUkrop. \"People want to be part of something that's about more than \njust dollars and cents.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ukrop brothers launched \"VALUES,\" an employee orientation \nprogram, in 1976. It introduces new associates to Ukrop's corporate \nculture and helps each employee \"learn both the work ethic and the \nworth ethic\" of the company, Ukrop explained. \"We have 5,700 \nassociates, ranging from age 16 to 86, and we want their work \nexperience at Ukrop's to be a life-enriching experience.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUkrop believes another driving force in the company's success is \"a \ndeep dissatisfaction with the status quo. We're continually trying to \nraise the bar, to get better at what we do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We try to listen very carefully to our customers and then be willing \nto change to embrace the changing needs of our customers,\" he added. \n\"We have found that people come to us not only to buy food but also \nfor the environment created in our stores by our associates. We want \npeople to leave our store feeling better than when they came in.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're not perfect, but when we make a mistake, we try to learn from \nit. Ultimately, our business is built on trust; and you can only \nbuild trust over time through relationships.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUkrop and his family are faithful members of Richmond's First Baptist \nChurch, where he teaches a fifth-grade Sunday school class. While he \nis open about his Christian faith, he refuses to equate business \nsuccess with God's favor and remains leery of the label \"Christian \nbusiness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We don't want anybody to shop with us because we happen to be \nChristians,\" he recently told Richmond's Inside Business newspaper. \n\"We want them to come because of our products and services. We don't \nthink we have a 'divine right' to be successful; we have to work at \nit very hard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think there are times being Christians does enable us to run our \nbusiness more effectively,\" he said. \"We try to model servant \nleadership. Jesus was a great example of a servant leader, and we try \nto model our lives after Jesus. But we also know that we have people \nfrom many different races and faiths who work with us and shop with \nus, and we try to value and respect everybody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUkrop noted that a poster in the stores encourages employees to \"go \nto our house of worship this week.\" A few decades ago, he said, the \nsign would have read \"church\" instead of \"house of worship.\" The \nchange in language respects employees' different faith traditions \nwhile still reflecting Ukrop's core values.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe company's mission-based focus is mirrored in the personal mission \nstatement that guides Ukrop's life: \"to use my passion to inspire \nmyself and others to help build loving families who honor God daily.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNot surprisingly, he believes his vocation involves more than earning \na living.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I look upon what I do as a ministry,\" he said. \"And I love it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Wilkinson is a well-known Baptist journalist currently writing \nnews stories and features for EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "words": "Unwanted Girls Aborted\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians in India fight female feticide and illegal prenatal \ntesting.\u0014\nBy Manpreet Singh in New Delhi | posted 03/21/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nAn ill-looking pregnant woman stands outside an unlicensed medical \nclinic in Chandigarh, the capital city of Punjab state. Only 31, \nMadhu has already undergone four abortions after illegal prenatal \ntests indicated she was pregnant with girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadhu, a Hindu, already has given birth to two daughters. Her husband \nhas threatened to abandon her, and his parents verbally abuse her for \nnot producing a boy to carry on the family name. Madhu's own parents \nsay it is her \"curse\" to bear only girls.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think bad thoughts,\" Madhu says in a feeble voice. \"If the test \nsays it is a girl again, I will commit suicide.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn India, a cultural obsession for boys drives 5 million women to \nkill their unborn baby girls every year, according to the United \nNations Children's Fund. But that may be changing. In January, \nIndia's highest court ordered state officials to confiscate the \nphysical assets of prenatal sex-determination clinics that use \nunlicensed ultrasound machines. India's high court sometimes takes \nthe unusual step of issuing rulings apart from specific court cases. \nThis ruling was in response to a plea from health activist Sabu M. \nGeorge and two nongovernmental organizations.\u0014\n\u0014\nHigh-tech Killing\u0014\n\u0014\nThe advent of high-tech ultrasound equipment in India has encouraged \na boom in female feticide, despite a 1994 law that bans using the \ntechnology to determine the sex of unborn children. Many Indians see \ngirls as an excessive financial burden because of the dowry system. \nAlthough the system has been illegal for 40 years, many families of \ngirls must still pay dowries ranging from $500 to $50,000, depending \non social status, to marry into good families.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For a mother to kill her child is not easy,\" says Neelam Gupta, \nsenior program officer at the Indian Council of Child Welfare. \"She \nis forced to kill. She has no right on her womb. She is pressured by \nher husband, in-laws, and relatives to commit this crime.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statistics tell a grim story. Among children up to 6 years old, \nthere were only 945 girls for every 1,000 boys in 1991. Last year, \nthe ratio slipped to 933 per 1,000. Many physicians provide the \nillegal tests and abort female babies for hefty bribes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Doctors have sold their soul for greed,\" says George, who comes from \na Christian background. \"It is tragic. While in the West the \ntechnology is being used to bring healthier children, here [it is \nused to select] boys.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians say that churches need to speak out more loudly. \"[The] \nSupreme Court order would no doubt give more teeth to the law, but \nlarger social awareness and education [are] required,\" says Joseph \nD'Souza, president of the All India Christian Council (AICC). \n\"Christians can do a lot in this field.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProblem for Christians\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians admit that feticide is practiced even in their own \ncommunities, \"wherever there is high dowry,\" says John Dayal, \nsecretary general of the AICC. \"In [the] south, particularly in parts \nof Kerala, the dowry is becoming a major problem among Christians and \nhas tragic social ramifications.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe AICC organized a seminar on the issue last October. Its women's \ndepartment is drawing up plans that will include starting support \ngroups. The Indian Medical Association last year organized a \nconvention that asked religious leaders to use their influence to \nstop female feticide.\u0014\n\u0014\nAICC president D'Souza admits that India's Christian minority is \npractically invisible on the issue. \"[The] Indian church is \ndefinitely guilty of ignoring and remaining silent on this very \nimportant issue,\" D'Souza says. A \"minority complex has kept the \nchurch silent, thinking that the problem is too big and we [are] so \nfew.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The reason why [the] church has not come out strongly is because the \nproblem is so massive,\" says Donald H. R. De Souza, deputy secretary \ngeneral of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. \"It's like \n[trying] to solve the problem of poverty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndia's Christian community, about 2.4 percent of the nation's 1 \nbillion people, has historically exerted a social influence far \nbeyond its numbers. Englishman William Carey (17611834), sometimes \ncalled the father of modern missions, led the fight against the \nnow-banned Hindu practice of suttee, or widow burning. Christians \nhave started many hospitals and coeducational schools in India.\u0014\n\u0014\nHonoring Girls\u0014\n\u0014\nJyotsna Chatterjee, a Christian, directs the Joint Women's Program, \nan umbrella organization for several women's rights organizations. \n\"We create awareness, lobby for women's power, have workers visiting \nnursing homes,\" Chatterjee says. \"We work at the grassroots levels to \nspread awareness by visiting slums and rural villages and educate \n[people] by staging street plays and other cultural programs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDonald De Souza says the Catholic Church is preparing to observe \nSeptember 8 as Girl Child Day in India. He says, \"We go to the poor \nin the rural areas and make them aware of the dignity of life created \nin the image of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Madhu discovers from her ultrasound that she is \"luckily\" \ncarrying a boy.

If the happy songs of a Disney \nmovie on the VCR fill her house long\u0014\n                      past the 9 p.m. bedtime of 6-year-old twins \nVictoria and Gregory, so be it. The kids are\u0014\n                      having a blast, and Rudd is \"too tired to be \ndisciplined.\" But the Chicago nonprofit\u0014\n                      executive dreads what she and her husband will \nface the next day: the miserable\u0014\n                      chore of rousing the kidsparticularly a grumpy \nVictoria; Gregory is more\u0014\n                      manageablein time for the 8:50 a.m. school \nbell. This week starts another jampacked\u0014\n                      school year when Rudd worries that \"you can't \nfit it all in.\" With dance classes,\u0014\n                      soccer, gymnastics, arts and crafts sessions, \nand homework, the bedtime deadline is\u0014\n                      in constant jeopardy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The first school bell of  the year also signals \ncrunch time for the Pass family of Fair\u0014\n                      Lawn, N.J. Nearly every day, Hayley, 8, and \nEric, 11, have some combination of\u0014\n                      baseball, soccer, or softball practice, \nreligious school, bowling, Brownies,\u0014\n                      and play dates.\u0014\n                      \u0014\n                      Something's got to give, and sometimes it's \nsleep. \"It's just the way life is now,\"\u0014\n                      sighs their mom,  Andrea, a publicist.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hard day's night. Choosing activities and \nfamily time over sack time seems natural\u0014\n                      for many parents, who want to bond with their \nkids and don't see enough of them. But\u0014\n                      the resulting lack of sleep is having \ndisastrous consequences on children's health. Up\u0014\n                      to 25 percent of U.S. children now suffer from \nsleep problems ranging from sleep\u0014\n                      walking to hormonal disruptions that can slow \ntheir growth, says Jodi Mindell, a\u0014\n                      psychologist at St. Joseph's University and \nassociate director of the Sleep Disorders\u0014\n                      Center at the Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia. Sleep-deprived kids often perform\u0014\n                      poorly in school and can be too erratic to \nmaintain friendships. A handful are\u0014\n                      misdiagnosed with attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when they're really\u0014\n                      just too tired to pay attention. Sometimes a \nmedical problem, like trouble breathing, is\u0014\n                      behind sleeplessness. But whatever the reason, \nthis generation of children is up at all\u0014\n                      hours. According to one study, 27 percent of \nschool-age kids resist going to bed, and\u0014\n                      11 percent can't fall asleep. In the morning, \n17 percent can't get up. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's particularly troubling to physicians is \nthat parents are often behind these\u0014\n                      problemsthey simply don't make routine bedtime \na priority. Many are hectic,\u0014\n                      sleep-starved people themselves, and they \nforget that children are not miniature\u0014\n                      adults; kids are hit much harder by sleep \ndeprivation. \"If you are keeping your child up\u0014\n                      until 11 p.m. for family time, you need to \nre-examine your life.\" says child\u0014\n                      psychotherapist Barbara Braun-McDonald of \nBrewster, Mass. \"It's not a tough call,\"\u0014\n                      adds Minneapolis therapist William Doherty, who \nstudies family dynamics at the\u0014\n                      University of Minnesota. \"Kids need sleep, and \nif they don't get enough, it affects\u0014\n                      everything else in their lives and the time you \nhave together. Kids need sleep as they\u0014\n                      need food.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet there is a night light at the end of this \ntunnel. Adopting a tight bedtime and\u0014\n                      wake-time routineand maintaining it on \nweekendsbuilds healthy sleep patterns, gets\u0014\n                      children the sleep recommended for each age \n(related story), and still creates family\u0014\n                      bonding time. There's also medical help \navailable. If a parent suspects an undiagnosed\u0014\n                      problem, such as the breathing trouble known as \nsleep apnea, doctors and therapists\u0014\n                      at a sleep laboratory can monitor, detect, and \ntreat it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pediatric sleep disorders blipped onto doctors' \nradar screens in the past 10 years,\u0014\n                      says Stephen Sheldon, a pediatrician at \nNorthwestern University and director of the\u0014\n                      Sleep Medicine Center at Children's Memorial \nHospital in Chicago. \"It's not like we've\u0014\n                      been studying this since 1900,\" he says. \"It \nwas recognized before the 1990s, but\u0014\n                      there wasn't a lot of emphasis placed on it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What doctors are learning is that the physical \nconsequences of sleep\u0014\n                      deprivationwhether rooted in medical or \nbehavioral problemsstart when children\u0014\n                      doze off. Deep sleep triggers releases of human \ngrowth hormone, a substance that\u0014\n                      stimulates bone and muscle growth and revs the \nbody's energy consumption up or\u0014\n                      down. Release of the substance partly depends \non body temperatures during sleep.\u0014\n                      Sleep brings a temperature drop and a hormone \nsurge. If a child stays awake, his\u0014\n                      temperature remains high and growth hormone can \nstay aaaaaaaaaaaaa up. Kids who don't get\u0014\n                      enough of the hormone tend to be underweight. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Other body chemicals can be disrupted by an odd \nsleep schedule, too. Thyroid\u0014\n                      hormones, which also affect energy levels, can \nbe thrown off, as can cortisol, which\u0014\n                      helps the body respond to stresswhether it's \nthe result of being chased on the\u0014\n                      playground or fighting off an infectionand \nhelps control the levels of sugar in the\u0014\n                      blood.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Cranky kids. What's the upshot of the chemical \nconfusion? Crankiness is a common\u0014\n                      consequence, though not one to be taken \nlightly. Children with sleep debts often have\u0014\n                      a shortened attention span, and are irritable, \nfrenetic, and impatient. These kids may\u0014\n                      have a hard time making friends, says Beth \nGoodlin-Jones, a psychiatrist at the\u0014\n                      University of California-Davis. Such children \ncould also face difficulties at school\u0014\n                      because they can't follow directions. \"As \nchildren are growing, they are developing\u0014\n                      their personalities, learning social \nstrategies, and building relationships,\" says\u0014\n                      Goodlin-Jones. \"If they are doing that with a \nchronic sleep problem, their interaction\u0014\n                      and how they treat others will be impacted.\" \nThe longer these issues go unresolved,\u0014\n                      the more serious social friction can become.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tired school-age children have trouble \nregulating their behavior, though nobody knows\u0014\n                      for sure the exact mechanism behind the \n\"bouncing off the walls\" phenomenon, says\u0014\n                      Sheldon. One theory is that the brain and \nmuscles in children are not synchronized\u0014\n                      and don't tire simultaneously. Instead, the \nbrain gets tired first and loses control of the\u0014\n                      muscles, meaning drowsy kids might start \nrunning around somewhat chaotically. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once you suspect a sleep deficit, take a hard \nlook at everything that may be robbing\u0014\n                      your child of slumber, says Judith Owens, a \npediatrician at Brown University Medical\u0014\n                      School and director of the pediatric sleep \ndisorders clinic at Hasbro Children's Hospital\u0014\n                      in Providence, R.I. That includes late-night \nswim meets, favorite video games, worries\u0014\n                      like a bully at school, new medications, \nbreathing problems, or even a barking dog. Her\u0014\n                      surveys of schoolchildren found nearly 40 \npercent had at least one sleep-related\u0014\n                      problem, such as irregular breathing or bedtime \nresistance. \"Any kid who has\u0014\n                      academic or behavior problems needs to be \nscreened for sleep problems,\" says\u0014\n                      Owens. \"That could be all of or at least part \nof the issue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And don't assume that anxiety about separating \nfrom you is behind your child's\u0014\n                      reluctance to sleep. The reasons can range from \npreteen rebellion to unresolved fears\u0014\n                      and anxieties that have little to do with \nseparation. One of the most common backdrops\u0014\n                      to bedtime resistance is what's called a \"sleep \nonset association disorder\"a fancy\u0014\n                      term for when a child must have a certain item, \nlike a blanket, or setting, like in Mom's\u0014\n                      arms, in order to fall asleep. The longer such \nneeds are humored, the harder it is to\u0014\n                      break the pattern.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But with some planning and vigilance, parents \ncan effectively foster healthy sleep\u0014\n                      patterns in most children. The process doesn't \nhave to be a battle of wills, say\u0014\n                      experts, if parents focus on the two clocks of \ncritical importance to a child's health:\u0014\n                      the body clock and the alarm clock. \"If you can \nkeep your child's body clock consistent\u0014\n                      day to day, that's when they will sleep at \ntheir best,\" says Mindell. That means dusting\u0014\n                      off the alarm clock and setting firm bedtimes \nand wake timesand not just on\u0014\n                      weekdays.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Humans' body clocks run on a close-to-24-hour \nschedule and are pinned to daylight as\u0014\n                      a cue for waking and nightfall as a cue to \nsleep. Shifting bedtime and wake time by\u0014\n                      even three hours over the course of a \nweekendtwo days of staying up later and\u0014\n                      getting up later than usualcan reset the \ninternal clock. Letting children have lax sleep\u0014\n                      schedules on the weekends is like deliberately \ngiving them jet lag, says Sheldon. You\u0014\n                      know that condition: It makes you tired, \ncranky, and generally discombobulated. It's\u0014\n                      especially hard for children, whose systems \nthrive on consistency, to reset their body\u0014\n                      clocks come Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Doctors say you can only let the wake-up time \non weekends slide by two hours\u0014\n                      maxmore than that and the body clock will \nlikely start to reset. If necessary, offer\u0014\n                      children a reason to rise \"even if it means \ninviting their friends to the house at 10 a.m.,\"\u0014\n                      says Alexander Golbin, director of the Sleep \nand Behavior Medicine Institute at Rush\u0014\n                      North Shore Medical Center in Skokie, Ill. Naps \nare fine if they last no more than 45\u0014\n                      minutes and occur between noon and 3 p.m. Naps \nthat exceed 11/2 hours or occur\u0014\n                      too late in the day can fluster normal body \nrhythms. \"If the nap is too long, you can ruin\u0014\n                      your night's sleep,\" he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If getting kids into bed at night becomes a \npower play, parents should focus on\u0014\n                      sticking to a consistent nightly ritual that \ncan include quiet time, baths, cuddling, reading\u0014\n                      stories, singing, and talking. But the ritual \nshould be a bit flexibleto settle down after\u0014\n                      an exciting day, let the child finish drawing a \npicture, or engage in a quiet activity, such\u0014\n                      as playing with a doll or reading a book. Offer \na warm, sweet liquid like hot milk with\u0014\n                      honey to be sipped slowly and quietly. Forget \nswitching on the televisionit will only\u0014\n                      further stimulate the child. The idea is to \ncreate a cozy, comfortable environment to\u0014\n                      help children relax and feel secure. And the \nbest benefit: Parents and kids get to\u0014\n                      spend some special time together.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When it comes to teenagers, of course, the warm \nand fuzzy approach often\u0014\n                      disappearsbehind a door slammed in your \nwell-meaning parental face. For teens,\u0014\n                      hours of homework, multiple extracurricular \nactivities, and after-school jobs can\u0014\n                      severely affect their sleep, says Lauren Broch, \ndirector of education training at the\u0014\n                      Sleep-Wake Disorders Center in New York \nPresbyterian Hospital. A typical teen needs\u0014\n                      about nine hours of sleep at night to operate \nwell during the day; most get only\u0014\n                      between 7 and 7 hours per night, and often \nless. \"Sleep is really being put on the\u0014\n                      back burner in teenagers, and that affects \nmood, cognitive functioning, the choices\u0014\n                      they make, and their quality of life,\" says \nBroch. Parents should help teens sketch out\u0014\n                      schedules that emphasize sleep and limit \nlate-night jobs or other nocturnal activities. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When it gets physical. If a child's lifestyle \nhas been examined, and no obvious\u0014\n                      causes for the lack of rest are discovered, \nit's time to analyze the quality of sleep.\u0014\n                      That's what doctors did for 9-year-old Nikolaus \nLetizio. As a kindergarten student he\u0014\n                      was diagnosed with ADHD as well as a form of \nautism. But in the past two years, the\u0014\n                      Philadelphia third grader began to misbehave \nmore at school and seemed extremely\u0014\n                      tired in the morning. His mother, Barbara, knew \nher son was restless in\u0014\n                      bedfrequently twisting positions and wrapping \nthe sheets into knotsbut he fell\u0014\n                      asleep easily and usually got his 10 hours. \nNikolaus's doctors decided it was time for a\u0014\n                      sleep study. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One evening this May, Barbara toted Nikolaus \nand his little teddy bear and favorite\u0014\n                      blanket to the Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia Sleep Disorders Center and Mindell's\u0014\n                      four-bed sleep lab. The kids and parents \nusually come in around 6 p.m. and stake out\u0014\n                      one of the private rooms, which feature \ntelevisions, video games, and a cot for the\u0014\n                      parent. After they settle in, a technician \nhooks up electrodes (wires connected to\u0014\n                      adhesive pads) to the child's head to monitor \nbrain activity, little sensors under the\u0014\n                      nose and belt around the chest and abdomen to \nmeasure breathing, and electrodes to\u0014\n                      the torso that monitor heart rate. Looking at \nNickolaus with all these gizmos stuck to\u0014\n                      him \"almost made me think of the Frankenstein \nstory,\" says Barbara, but he fell asleep\u0014\n                      in about 20 minutes. The sensors send back \ninformation in 30-second increments to a\u0014\n                      computer that creates a picture of how the \nchild sleeps. The portrait will later help\u0014\n                      Nickolaus's parents to focus on the boy's \nproblems.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Medical sleep disorders are rare; apnea, for \nexample, affects only about 4 percent of\u0014\n                      U.S. children, but it's one of the most serious \nproblems doctors see. Children with the\u0014\n                      condition stop breathing during the night, \nsometimes hundreds of times. The cause is\u0014\n                      often an obstruction in the respiratory tract \nor an actual closing of this vital airway.\u0014\n                      Each time, the body must partially rouse itself \nto open the throat. These episodes\u0014\n                      prevent deep sleep, reduce oxygen levels, and \ncause daytime irritability, and can\u0014\n                      prevent weight gain and the release of growth \nhormone. The good news is that apnea\u0014\n                      is easily treatedoften, removing extralarge \ntonsils does the trickso the American\u0014\n                      Academy of Pediatrics recommends doctors screen \nall children for snoring, a hallmark\u0014\n                      of the condition.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two other troubles that can keep kids up are \nrestless leg syndrome and what may be\u0014\n                      a related problem, periodic limb movement \ndisorder. Restless leg syndrome often\u0014\n                      produces complaints about a \"creepy-crawly\" \nfeeling in a child's legs. Children feel\u0014\n                      they have to move or walk around to get rid of \nit, making it hard to fall asleep.\u0014\n                      Scientists estimate that the syndrome affects 5 \npercent of the population. Many\u0014\n                      sufferers of restless legs also have a related \nneurological problem that causes them\u0014\n                      to rhythmically move their legs as they sleep. \nThis is called periodic limb movement\u0014\n                      disorder. It's not just kicking off the \ncoverspeople with PLMD move their limbs every\u0014\n                      few seconds or minutes. The body partially \nwakes up every time, keeping the sufferer\u0014\n                      from sleep. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In some cases, the symptoms of a severely \nsleep-deprived child mimic those of ADHD,\u0014\n                      the behavioral disorder usually treated with \nstimulant drugs or counseling. Owens\u0014\n                      believes that sleep quality and quantity should \nbe considered \"as either a major factor\u0014\n                      or contributing factor to ADHD symptoms. As \nmany as 25 percent of these [ADHD]\u0014\n                      kids may have an underlying sleep problem.\" She \nremembers one little girl who was\u0014\n                      unsuccessfully treated for ADHD for five years. \nThe 9-year-old, it turned out, had a\u0014\n                      nasty case of apnea: She stopped breathing an \naverage of 114 times every hour she\u0014\n                      slept.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though Mindell sees some of the most likely \ncandidates for medical disorders, still only\u0014\n                      half the children who bed down in her lab turn \nout to have one. Young Nikolaus was\u0014\n                      not in that group; he had normal sleep \npatterns. Now, doctors are looking at whether\u0014\n                      the medications he takes at night for his \nmyriad allergies could be making him overly\u0014\n                      tired, or whether his asthma is creating \nfatigue. Sleep studies are like X-rays or blood\u0014\n                      tests: They rule out some problems, detect \nothers, or force physicians to just look\u0014\n                      harder, says Mindell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The quiet life. All this harping about sleep \nmay grate on parents who are bombarded\u0014\n                      with media messages about the importance of \nfamily time. How does a parent help a\u0014\n                      kid grow up and develop coping strategies to \ndeal with the world? Just watching\u0014\n                      won't do, says child psychiatrist Stanley \nGreenspan of George Washington University\u0014\n                      Medical School, author of the new book The \nSecure Child. One of the keys is finding\u0014\n                      about a half hour after school or early in the \nevening to bond. For 5- to 7-year-olds,\u0014\n                      Greenspan calls for \"floor time,\" in which \nparents and children play games and have\u0014\n                      fun on the kid's terms. For older kids, he \ncalls the half-hour \"hang-out mode\"a time to\u0014\n                      chat about one's day and get updated on what's \ngoing on. This sliver of time offers\u0014\n                      children \"the basic sense of feeling cared \nfor,\" says Greenspan. \"You don't sacrifice\u0014\n                      sleep for time with parents or vice versa. If \nyou are doing one properly, you will help\u0014\n                      the other one. What's good for the kids' coping \nstrategies is also good for their sleep.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bugs Peterschmidt discovered this three years \nago, and the lesson came from the\u0014\n                      mouths of her children. Bugs (who prefers the \nnickname to her more formal given\u0014\n                      name, Margaret), 45, lives outside Minneapolis \nwith her two children and husband,\u0014\n                      Eric. In 1999, Max, then 11, and Betsy, then 7, \ntold their mother they wanted off their\u0014\n                      soccer teams. Between the two kids they had \nseven activities, and soccer was just\u0014\n                      too much. \"They were tired of always having to \ndo something,\" says Peterschmidt, a\u0014\n                      cake decorator. \"Max was tearful and burned \nout.\" Peterschmidt looked at her kids and\u0014\n                      decided everything was too much. \"I said: Let's \nexperiment and take a sabbatical from\u0014\n                      everything, and we did. It's been great, and we \nnever went back.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Peterschmidts started \"unplugged \nsummers\"no television or computers after\u0014\n                      dinner. During the school year, their \nnot-so-much-action plan means Max and Betsy's\u0014\n                      activities are kept to a minimum. Dinner is at \n6:15 p.m. sharp, with candlelight and\u0014\n                      without phone calls. The kids wash the dishes \nafter the meal while their parents read\u0014\n                      to them. \"My kids are so much happier,\" says \nPeterschmidt, a member of Putting Family\u0014\n                      First, a grass-roots group in Minnesota started \nby Doherty, the family therapist, that\u0014\n                      emphasizes family time.

    "words": "Ugly Evangelicals\u0014\nIs this us?\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the most interesting letters we receive are too long for \npublication in the magazine. One such letter arrived a couple of \nweeks ago from a new subscriber, William Mehr of Dumfries, Virginia, \nin response to our September/October issue. A small portion of his \nletter will appear in the Letters section of the November/December \nissue, but I wanted to share the entire letter with you. I'll respond \nto it in this space next week. (And I hope you will respond as wellI \nlook forward to your reactions to Mr. Mehr's letter.)\u0014\n* * *\u0014\nDear Editor:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe September/October issue (Christianity Today) was marvelous! It's \nthe second of my subscription, and I'm thrilled. Perhaps it's just \nthe way my mind works, but the articles seemed to flow in a way where \none or two central ideas kept surfacing in different form. If that \nwas intentional, bravo to the editor! If it wasn't,\"never mind!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith your continued indulgence, though, I wanted to ride that train \nthrough a few stations and maybe convince you of something that \nwasn't intended! To begin, the word, \"evangelical\" in the handy \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, 1981, is defined as \"of, pertaining to, \nor being a Protestant group emphasizing the authority of Gospel and \nholding that salvation is from faith and grace rather than from good \nworks and sacraments alone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been reading the stories of 19th-century abolitionists like John \nQuincy Adams and William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison was an evangelical \nof sorts, not one primarily operating through an otherworldly faith \nand grace but one who moved toward achieving salvation through the \ncreation of justice in culture. These are not mutually exclusive \npositions. There is discernment, rather, of where obedience lies \nwithin the call of an American social gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis summer, as chairperson of an ecumenical Christian council, I've \nled an effort to fund and manage a local homeless shelter in \npartnership with the financially strapped county government. There \nwere times when the secular professionals and the Christian \n\"do-gooders\" clashed, especially in terms of how many chances people \nare entitled to, but all things tended to work productively on a \ndaily ongoing basis, as the process of open discourse continued, not \ncompletely resolved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe editorial, \"Seven Years of Culture,\" quotes poet Joy Harjo: \n\"there's no sense engaging evangelical Christianity . because they \ndon't encourage interaction and thinking for yourself.\" In one sense \nour presence at the homeless shelter refutes Harjo's charge. We are \ncertainly Christians who encourage interaction and thinking. But do \nwe still belong in a category called \"evangelical\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, I look toward Garrison. In his newspaper, The Liberator, he \nrelished nothing better than to publish the letters and speeches of \nopponents so he could publicly debate the contents. Liberal \nChristiansnot entitled by common usage to call themselves \n\"evangelicals\" any longersense that those described as evangelicals \ntoday are unwilling to engage in discourse, and would rather move to \nsuppress disagreeable media than to openly dispute opposing views, \nand further that the evangelicals of today disingenuously claim \ndiscrimination when their efforts to suppress materials are \nchallenged and thwarted! Is that a fair judgment by the liberals? Is \nthere truth in it?\u0014\n\u0014\nWould David Lyle Jeffrey, following the logic of his column \"The \nBeginning of Wisdom,\" describe the progressive actions of the \nabolitionists of the 19th century as \"usurpations of God's \nprerogatives that are at best unworkable\"? Remember, the vast \nmajority of American clergy and university educators in the 19th \ncentury never endorsed abolition, nor even were willing to provide \nmeeting space to debate the issues. Is the Sermon on the Mount a \nguidebook for daily living, or is it an example posited by Jesus of \nwhat's not achievable by humans unless they surrender total obedience \nand personal initiative to God?\u0014\nJeffrey declares that \"every educational project including Christian \nones should declare a truth about its own limits,\" and that, \"moral \nintelligence does not follow from analytical intelligence; it \nprecedes it.\" Is it in Hauerwasian isolation, and Anabaptist retreat, \nthat a Christian works out a place, or not a place, in the world \nbased on an inherent vision, which is already severely limited in its \npotentiality by original sin? Or does moral intelligence rather \naccompany analytical intelligence, more than precede it, creating a \nNiebuhrian synthesis so that each quality transforms the other, in an \nencompassing woven spiral of mutual growth? It appears that the \nevangelicals of today are afraid of knowledge, regardless of its \nsource or precedence of acquisition. Why must that be so if they are \nconfidently convicted of eternal truth?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"Why Separation of Church and State Is Still a Good Idea,\" Alan \nWolfe quotes Philip Hamburger: \"while hostile to Christianity and any \nother distinct religion, the Liberals glowed with religious \nintensity.\" While liberal evangelicals like Garrison abandoned a \nmainline denominational Christianity that offered no support to their \ncause, their writings convey an intensely spiritual devotion to God, \nthe creator, and to the rights of all people as endowed in His image \nand as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. When Wolfe \nwrites of how \"strict separationists treat those who disagree with \nthem as un-American,\" is it not also true that those who desire to \ndismantle separations also claim a devoted allegiance to an America \nwhere pluralism is codified in law, yet claim that it is that same \npractice of pluralism that is at the relativistic root of an evil in \nthe culture that spawned and protects both parties of contention?\u0014\nIt may not be possible to have it both ways, and as Wolfe avows, \n\"opportunities for corruption are presented whenever government and \nreligion work too closely together.\" That, indeed, may be so in some \ncases, but it has not been our experience this summer operating a \nhomeless shelter. Garrison, indeed, rejected partisan politics \nholding fast to a moral vision that, in the end, swung his way due to \nthe eventual national recognition of the righteousness of his cause. \nIn our local cause and service, the government offers expertise and \nexperience from which our guests have benefited and from which we \nhave learned much. Conversely, the government has witnessed the high \nvalue we place on the lives of each person, regardless of \ncircumstances, and that there are other things that are effective, \nsuch as intercessory prayer, that are not recognized by officialdom. \nIt's within this partnership with the world, in extraordinary, \nfrequently life-and-death circumstances, that deep has cried out to \ndeep, and where both parties have grown together in witness that all \nthings are possible on heaven and earth, including miracles. It's \nservice that simultaneously functions as an effective \nnon-proselytizing evangelism that sits well in the pluralistic \nAmerican context. In that sense, then, are we acting as evangelicals \nas defined today?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"Force of Habit: Hostility and condescension toward religion in \nthe university,\" Christian Smith employs anecdotes as evidence, much \nas President Reagan did when he set out to create the myth of the \nwelfare queen. From that subjective foundation, he strives to take a \nleap towards objectivity, by writing \"we can see in their \nanti-religion, these faculty are expressing a deeply interiorized \nmental scheme that is more prereflective than conscious, more \nconventional then intentionalyet one that has an immense power to \nreproduce a pervasive institutional culture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals of today, in like vein, don't seem to evince much faith \nin people, perhaps because they, indeed, believe in the severe \nlimitations that original sin has imposed. But, the American \npopulace, borne from the Common Sense philosophy of the Scottish \nenlightenment, has always showed a remarkable sound judgment and \ndecisional capability that has served as the continual bedrock of \npolitical stability in this country. It bends and swings, right and \nleft, but never breaks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe evangelicals of today can claim many virtues, but subtlety is not \nperceived to be among them, and this greatly hurts their cause. \nThat's their greatest, possibly irresolvable, conundrum. For just as \nSmith notes inconsistencies with \"champions of diversity and equality \nwho would like nothing more than to see religion disempowered and \nmarginalized from public life,\" the evangelicals of today don't \nappear as if they'd be satisfied to merely exist within a greater \ncivic sphere, but would only be satisfied if they were successful in \nimposing their creed on that public arena. The burden of proof falls \non them to prove otherwise, and so far, they have not been able to do \nso in light of a higher obedience to accomplish the Great Commission, \nand out of a sincere and genuine love and motivation to save souls.\u0014\nSmith writes of an American higher educational system that embraces \n\"the variety of religious perspectives,\" but the general impression \nof evangelicals today is that this is not what is desired, and that \nrather evangelicals are just as likely as the left to impose a narrow \nsystem of learning as any other coterie that emerges with the \nauthority to do so. John Henry Newman wrote much in this area about \nthe ways people learn. Most people consciously or subconsciously read \nto confirm pre-existing views. Newman strongly advocated that people \napproach education in a manner that allows for reason to formulate \nconclusions, and along with the apostolic Fathers, and later Aquinas, \nNewman conveyed in his writings (if not his actions at Oxford) \nconfidence that people would naturally draw towards the good, and \nGod, through an open learning process. How that differs from Luther \nand the evangelicals of today, who at best, view humanity, even \nbaptized and saved, in Luther's colorful phrase as \"snow-covered \ndung,\" and as incapable of being left alone in a world of endless \ncompeting sources of data and images to draw their own conclusions.\u0014\n\u0014\nLastly, Alan Jacobs, in \"Computer Control, Part 3,\" writes \nwhimsically of a \"virtual National Gallery [that] lacks the surround \nof the real world,\" and how it can't \"provide the contexts, \ncontrasts, and surprises that the world offers.\" I, on the other \nhand, relish and welcome, without fear or trepidation, the technology \nthat has created another public square for disputate. Left on its \nown, the new world would become an end in itself, designed for profit \nand immediate gratification. That's exactly the place where the \nevangelicals of today can make themselves known, without boundaries, \nand where the Gospel and love of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, can \nsave, and also remind the world, through our story, that no one needs \nbe left behind in body and spirit. This summer, through email, I've \nhotly debated the professionals and shelter directors who work in the \nfield of homelessness, urging them evermore to witness to grace, and \ninclude forgiveness, in their hospitalityand when they turn away a \nperson who has relapsed for the tenth time, I've argued that \nChristians will always keep the door open to the possibility of \nredemption for every person regardless of past transgressions. \nTechnology robbed nothing of the \"surround\" and passion of this vital \ndiscourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Jacobs quotes John Updike, \"the mind needs resistance in \norder to function properly; it understands itself and its \nsurroundings through encountering boundaries, borders, limitsall \nthat pushes back or refuses to yield.\" When this self-styled \nevangelical of the 19th century-type enters into negotiations with \ncorporal authority, on behalf of the people we serve, he makes sure \nthat the evangelicals of the 21st century-type are providing \nintercessory prayer. It works. Just as Daniel Taylor described in \n\"Many Bibles, One Scripture,\" the differing new versions complement \neach other, as do the varied denominations of our ecumenical council, \neach free to operate, as God calls through their gifts, in the \ncultural pluralism of America today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is that freedom to think and choose whichas I read and devour \nyour publicationI sense we both celebrate, despite the tactics we \nboth employ of the world for the same ultimate purpose in the world. \nWas I able to convince you, dear editor, that this issue contained a \nsingle theme running throughout the articles? That's up to you now. I \ncan't wait for the next issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Mehr\u0014\nDumfries, Virginia\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Min.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Fundamentalist movements in \nAmerican Protestantism in the\u0014\n                                    20th century have found the need \nfor rule-bound rigidity,\u0014\n                                    religious purification and the \nall-sufficiency of a perceived\u0014\n                                    source of orthodox authority, an \ninerrant application of the Holy\u0014\n                                    Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    It is possible that at least a \npart of the driving force behind\u0014\n                                    these movements lay in the \nshame-bound behavior of\u0014\n                                    fundamentalist believers and \nleaders. The implication is that\u0014\n                                    religious fundamentalists bear a \nburden of unhealthy guilt that\u0014\n                                    we can call shame. If this is \ntrue, a direct link would lie between\u0014\n                                    the ethical behavior of religious \nfundamentalists and the shame\u0014\n                                    they carry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    To pursue this theme, we need to \nclarify terms. For our\u0014\n                                    purposes, we can define \nfundamentalism as a religious\u0014\n                                    movement that militantly defends \northodoxy against modern\u0014\n                                    incursions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    These intrusions may be about \nshifting interpretations of holy\u0014\n                                    writings, changing ethical values \nin the native culture or the\u0014\n                                    complicated anxiety that \naccompanies intense and rapid social\u0014\n                                    change. Although guilt and shame \nmay have the same\u0014\n                                    emotional origin, it is important \nthat the reader understands\u0014\n                                    they are different. Shame, an \nunhealthy form of guilt, is toxic to\u0014\n                                    the victim's selfhood. Kaufman, \nGershen, Shame: the Power of\u0014\n                                    Caring, says:\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         \"Shame is an inner sense of \nbeing completely\u0014\n                                         diminished or insufficient \nas a person. It is the self\u0014\n                                         judging the self. A moment \nof shame may be\u0014\n                                         humiliation so painful or an \nindignity so profound\u0014\n                                         that one feels one has been \nrobbed of her or his\u0014\n                                         dignity or exposed as \nbasically inadequate, bad,\u0014\n                                         or worthy of rejection. A \npervasive sense of shame\u0014\n                                         is the ongoing premise that \none is fundamentally\u0014\n                                         bad, inadequate, defective, \nunworthy, or not valid\u0014\n                                         as a human being.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Therefore, guilt is not \nsynonymous with shame.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         \"Guilt is the \ndevelopmentally more mature, though\u0014\n                                         painful feeling of regret \none has about behavior\u0014\n                                         that has violated a personal \nvalue.\" Kaufman said\u0014\n                                         in The Psychology of Shame. \n\"Guilt is immorality\u0014\n                                         shame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    That is, it is a violation of the \ninternal moral code one has\u0014\n                                    developed. Guilt is a \nself-generated feeling of disgust with\u0014\n                                    one's actions. Shame is an \nother-generated sense of disgust\u0014\n                                    with oneself as a person of \nworth. Parents and the victim's\u0014\n                                    family of origin more often \nassign it to the victim.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    If you ever heard a parent say \nsomething like, \"why can't you\u0014\n                                    be like your brother,\" or \"I \ncan't believe you are so stupid,\" then\u0014\n                                    you have known shame. When a \nchild hears statements like\u0014\n                                    these throughout maturing years, \nthe adult-child becomes\u0014\n                                    shame-based.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    The church, undoubtedly, also has \nbeen a source of shame for\u0014\n                                    Christians. When you hear sermons \nrepeatedly calling you an\u0014\n                                    evil sinner, when you hear often \nthat you are dirty and filthy\u0014\n                                    with sin, you can feel soiled \nspiritually.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Seeing shame-based Christians \nmaking repeated public\u0014\n                                    statements of rededication is \ncommon among Baptists and\u0014\n                                    other evangelicals using the \naltar call or invitation as a time of\u0014\n                                    public profession of faith. They \nhear their inner critic declaring\u0014\n                                    them unclean.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Guilt is not their issue. It is \nshame. The very institution founded\u0014\n                                    on the grace of God in Christ, \nthe church, can enhance and\u0014\n                                    empower this inner critic. They \nneed deliverance from\u0014\n                                    self-loathing, not forgiveness \nfor sins committed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Merle Fossum and Marilyn Mason, \nThe Psychology of Shame,\u0014\n                                    suggested that a shame-bound \nfamily is a group of people who\u0014\n                                    feel alone together. We may also \nsay that a shame-bound\u0014\n                                    church is one in which the \nmembers feel alone together.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Church members judge each other \non a goodness vs. badness\u0014\n                                    scale. In this system, the \npreservation of one's personal\u0014\n                                    goodness is foundational to one's \nacceptance by other church\u0014\n                                    members. They subsequently reach \nfor connection in the\u0014\n                                    powerful inner circle.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    However, a member of an inner \ncircle that requires them to\u0014\n                                    stick to goodness as defined by \nthe group becomes\u0014\n                                    preoccupied with maintaining the \ngoodness factor. They have\u0014\n                                    little time for fellowship and \nauthentic expressions of affection\u0014\n                                    and need.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Grace, the unconditional love of \nothers as God loves us, is not\u0014\n                                    the operative ethic. Preserving \none's personal goodness is.\u0014\n                                    Intimate relationships with \nbrothers and sisters in Christ is\u0014\n                                    subordinated to preserving the \nappearance of goodness even\u0014\n                                    when there may be feelings of \nlittle or none.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Shame-bound systems follow \ncertain rules, according to\u0014\n                                    Fossum and Mason. These are just \nas true of shame-based\u0014\n                                    persons, marriages, families and \nchurches. While there are at\u0014\n                                    least eight of these regulations, \nthis article will allow for only\u0014\n                                    three.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    The first and all-important rule \nis that one must always\u0014\n                                    give the impression of being in \ncontrol of one's life at all\u0014\n                                    times. This is the cardinal rule \nof all shame-bound relational\u0014\n                                    groups in that all other rules \nflow from this one and help it\u0014\n                                    remain in place.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Since shame-bound persons come \nfrom families-of-origin in\u0014\n                                    which their worth is always \nquestioned and diminished, one way\u0014\n                                    an adult-child learns to cope \nwith these subsequent feelings of\u0014\n                                    inferiority is always to seem \npowerful and in control of one's life,\u0014\n                                    proving his worth in his world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    The second rule of shame-bound \nfundamentalism is that\u0014\n                                    one must always be right and do \nthe right thing\u0014\n                                    according to group law and \nespecially the leadership.\u0014\n                                    This means that the individual \nstrives for a kind of spiritual\u0014\n                                    perfection to maintain his sense \nof personal power and control\u0014\n                                    from within the group.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Apart from the parent \norganization, there is no awareness of\u0014\n                                    increased self-worth but only \ndeep self-questioning. These\u0014\n                                    persons become strong competitors \nbecause they have to be\u0014\n                                    proving their inherent value to \nothers. They must look better\u0014\n                                    than others.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    They become the hard-working \nchurch members who can be\u0014\n                                    used up and burnt out by \ncontrolling leadership. Their personal\u0014\n                                    worth depends on their winning \nand being seen by others as\u0014\n                                    high-achieving winners. The \npersonal, family, or church image,\u0014\n                                    what the rest of the world sees, \nis foremost.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    The third rule of shame-bound \nfundamentalist religious\u0014\n                                    groups is blaming others. If \nsomething does not happen the\u0014\n                                    way you planned, blame yourself \nor someone else, if possible.\u0014\n                                    Blame helps one maintain the \nillusion of control and helps the\u0014\n                                    system remain pure.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    They can transfer one's personal \nsins to another thereby\u0014\n                                    helping the blamer feel freed \nfrom his own anxieties. Blame\u0014\n                                    also keeps the rules rigidly in \nplace. By blaming, one declares\u0014\n                                    they did not break the rules. \nAnother did. Therefore, the rules\u0014\n                                    become more important than \nrelationships.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    They thereby elevate rules to the \nlevel of love and mercy in\u0014\n                                    terms of importance in one's life \nof faith.

    "words": "Did You Know? \u0014\nInteresting and unusual facts about John and Charles Wesley. \u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman \u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas Miracle\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Charles was born, on December 18, 1707, his parents thought he \nwas dead because he neither cried nor opened his eyes. He was several \nweeks premature, so they wrapped him in wool until the day he should \nhave been delivered. He eventually came around and apparently had a \nhealthy childhood. His parents lost eight or nine other children in \ninfancy. \u0014\n\u0014\nBooks Are Made for Walking\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wesley brothers never hitched a ride from collegethey walked the \n150 miles to Epworth instead. The journey was often marred by bad \nroads, inclement weather, and even highwaymen. To make matters worse, \nthe brothers read books while they walked. The trip scared their \nfather so badly that he once told them, \"I should be so pleased to \nsee ye here this spring, if it was not upon the hard conditions of \nyour walking hither.\" John maintained that reading for 10 of his 25 \ndaily miles never caused any harm.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrickly Peer\u0014\n\u0014\nThe curmudgeonly Samuel Johnson (1709 1784) had mixed feelings about \nthe Wesleys. He knew John at Oxford, and said of him, \"John Wesley's \nconversation is good, but he is never at leisure. He is always \nobliged to go at a certain hour. This is very disagreeable to a man \nwho loves to fold his legs and have out his talk, as I do.\" Johnson \nlater applauded Oxford's expulsion of six Methodist students (see \npage 22), which could hardly have endeared him to the movement's \nfounding family. Yet at the end of his life, he wanted to invite \nJohn's brilliant but financially restricted sister Martha to live at \nhis house. Unfortunately, Johnson died before his wish could be \ncarried out.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"An Odd Way of Thinking\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSusanna Wesley was not quite sure what to make of her sons' \nheart-warming conversion experiences. She wrote to Charles, \"I think \nyou are fallen into an odd way of thinking. You say that till within \na few months you had no spiritual life, nor any justifying faith. Now \nthis is as if a man should affirm he was not alive in his infancy, \nbecause when an infant he did not know he was alive. All, then, that \nI can gather from your letter is that till a little while ago you \nwere not so well satisfied of your being a Christian as you are now.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPepper-upper\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles could sympathize with today's caffeine addicts. In 1746 he \ntried to give up tea, but writes, \"my flesh protested against it. I \nwas but half awake and half alive all day; and my headache so \nincreased toward noon, that I could neither speak nor think. This so \nweakened me, that I could hardly sit my horse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThanks, but No Thanks\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the Methodists earned early acclaim for their ministry to \nmarginalized groups such as prisoners, orphans, and the ill, they \nlater became so unpopular that even these doors closed to them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs John recorded in his journal for February 22, 1750, \"So we are \nforbid to go to Newgate [a prison], for fear of making them wicked; \nand to Bedlam [an asylum], for fear of driving them mad!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNot Dead Yet\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1753, John became so ill that his doctor thought he would die. \nJust in case, John penned this epitaph:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHere lieth the Body of\u0014\nJohn Wesley\u0014\nA brand plucked out of the burning:\u0014\nwho died of a consumption in the fifty-first year of his age,\u0014\nnot leaving, after his debts are paid,\u0014\nten pounds behind him:\u0014\npraying,\u0014\nGod be merciful to me, an unprofitable servant! \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn, whose mother had called him \"a brand plucked out of the \nburning\" after he was rescued from a house fire in 1709, resolved to \ncheat death again. Two days after he wrote the epitaph, he made \nhimself a poultice of brimstone (sulfur), egg white, and brown paper, \nwhich immediately relieved his pain. He recovered and lived another \n38 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nReady to Rumble\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter increasingly severe earthquakes in England on February 8 and \nMarch 8, 1750, a self-proclaimed prophet predicted another quake in \nApril that would destroy half of London. The city went berserk. \nCharles wrote 19 hymns on the subject and published a sermon called \n\"The Cause and Cure of Earthquakes.\" On the foretold night, John \nreported, \"Places of worship were packed, especially the chapels of \nthe Methodists.\" Nothing happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2001 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014\nClick here for reprint information on Christian History.\u0014\nIssue 69, Winter 2001, Vol. XX, No. 1, Page 2\u0014",

He had \nevery Jew wear the star and he himself wore the Star of David. He \ntold his people that he expected every loyal Dane to do the same. The \nKing said, \"We are all Danes.

The King of Denmark identified with \nhis people, even to the point of putting his own life on the line.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a wonderful story with a powerful point.

    "words": "U.S. Apathetic to Middle East Injustices\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Vinoth Ramachandra\u0014\nTuesday, February 14, 2012 \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nFundamentalists in the American \"Bible Belt\" and elsewhere \"fail to \nsee that the modern state of Israel has nothing at all to do with the \nancient covenant people, the Israelites,\" Ramachandra says.\u0014\nI once had an argument with an American atheist Jew, who insisted \nthat being a Jew was a matter of ethnicity and had nothing to do with \n\"religion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLater, I found that I had on my side Jonathan Sacks, perhaps the most \narticulate and winsome spokesperson for Judaism in today's world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Judaism is not an ethnicity and Jews are not an ethnic group,\" \nwrites Sacks. \"Go to the Western Wall in Jerusalem and you will see \nJews of every colour and culture under the sun, the Beta Israel from \nEthiopia, the Bene Israel from India, Bukharan Jews from central \nAsia, Iraqi, Berber, Egyptian, Kurdish and Libyan Jews, the Temamim \nfrom Yemen, alongside American Jews from Russia, South African Jews \nfrom Lithuania, and British Jews from German-speaking Poland. Their \nfood, music, dress, customs, and conventions are all different.\" \n(Future Tense, 2009)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe late Arthur Koestler believed that most Jews today are \ndescendants of the semi-nomadic Turkic people from the Caucasus, the \nKhazars, who converted to Judaism in the seventh to 10th centuries.\u0014\nThe latest theory, advanced by Tsvi Misinai, a retired Israeli \ncomputer expert, is that the Palestinians are actually the people who \nmay be ethnically Jewish.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are descendants of Jews who remained in the land when, under \nRoman rule, most Jews went into exile in Babylon and elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews who left continued to practice Judaism. Those who stayed \nbecame first Christian, then Muslim. It is a theory once held by none \nother than David Ben Gurion.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the Palestinians at war with Israel may be \"Jewish,\" while the \n\"Jews\" may not be genetically \"Jewish\" at all!\u0014\n\u0014\nI wish I could say this to those fundamentalists in the American \n\"Bible Belt\" and elsewhere, who are uncritically pro-Israeli even as \nthe Israeli state bulldozes Palestinian homes, forces thousands of \nmen, women and children into dehumanized camps, and appropriates land \nto which it has absolutely no right.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelecting isolated texts from the Old Testament, and bypassing the \nNew Testament entirely, they fail to see that the modern state of \nIsrael has nothing at all to do with the ancient covenant people, the \nIsraelites.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are more Jews living outside Israel than within. But, if you do \nbelieve that Israel today is an answer to biblical prophecy, then \nspeak to the leaders of Israel the way the biblical prophets did: \"If \nyou continue to commit oppression and atrocities against others, I \nwill spew you out of the land.\"\u0014\nLast month, an Iranian university professor, 32-year-old Mostafa \nAhmadi-Roshan, was killed when unidentified men on motorcycles \nattached a magnetic bomb to his car in a Tehran street.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was the fourth Iranian nuclear scientist to be assassinated in \nrecent years by what every reasonable observer knows are Israeli \nagents, with at least the tacit approval of the CIA. These are \nblatant acts of terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf committed on Western soil, they would evoke outrage in the \nAmerican and European media. But, instead, they are met with apathy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn typical fashion, the U.S. administration is now bullying the rest \nof the world to boycott Iran economically and isolate it politically.\u0014\n\u0014\nIran has a scientific and intellectual culture greater than that of \nany of the West's allies in the Middle East, excepting Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, the murder of its top scientist engaged in their nuclear energy \nprogram is an attack on Iran's ability to function as a society \nwithout dependence on Western technical hegemony.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd why should Iran not have nuclear weapons to match Israel? \nAmerican-Soviet relations in the Cold War were conducted under the \nmorally perverse doctrine known as MAD (Mutually Assured \nDestruction): as long as two hostile states could keep match with \neach other's capacity for annihilating the other, they will not go to \nwar. Why not apply MAD to the Middle East?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all the bluster that comes out of Tehran, the real terror has \nbeen inflicted in the opposite direction, beginning with the \ninterference in 1953 by the U.S. and Britain to install a dictator \nwho would protect their oil companies.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd have Americans forgotten the shooting down of an Iranian \ncommercial airliner in Iranian airspace by a U.S. guided missile \ncruiser, the USS Vincennes, in 1988?\u0014\n\u0014\nAll 290 passengers on board were killed. To this day, no U.S. \ngovernment has apologized to the Iranian people.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the American public, including many American church leaders, \nare profoundly ignorant of the history of the Middle East, let alone \nwhat is still being done by American soldiers and citizens in other \nparts of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have nothing but disgust for their culpable ignorance, culpable \nbecause the facts are in their computers and libraries if only they \ntake the trouble to look.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I have nothing but disgust for those who know the facts but are \ntoo uncaring to speak out and hold their governments accountable for \nwar crimes and other human rights abuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I have nothing but deep admiration for those Israelis and \nIranians who courageously seek to bring moral and political change in \ntheir nations; as well as for those Palestinian Christians who \ncontinue to show patience and goodwill to their American brethren who \nhave betrayed them and the Christian faith by their guilty silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me end with Rabbi Sacks who writes that \"at some stage Jews \nstopped defining themselves by the reflection they saw in the eyes of \nGod and started defining themselves by the reflection they saw in the \neyes of their Gentile neighbours  obsessed by the Holocaust.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he calls on them to \"take a stand, not motivated by fear, not \ndriven by paranoia or a sense of victimhood, but a positive stand on \nthe basis of the values by which our ancestors lived and for which \nthey were prepared to die: justice, equity, compassion, love of the \nstranger, the sanctity of life and the dignity of the human person \nwithout regard to colour, culture or creed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians and Muslims can learn from him to do the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nVinoth Ramachandra is secretary for dialogue and social engagement \nfor the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. He lives in \nSri Lanka. A version of this column first appeared on his blog.\u0014",

Paying \nthis tribute to the crown allowed nobleman and peasant alike to hunt, \nfish, and frolic on the regal property.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe king, looking to reduce the strain on this resource and increase \nthe empire's income (to help support the war with France), decided to \nraise the usage fee and restrict use of the forest to the upper \nclasses.  To carry out this decree, he appointed Thomas Mulberry as \nRoyal Forester.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it wasn't long before Thomas realized he had a problem.  The \nking expected a certain amount of revenue each month, but there \nsimply weren't enough customers among the upper classes to maintain \nthe projected revenues.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to keep to the crown's budget, Thomas decided to allow use \nof the forest by some of the local peasants at a discounted rate.  \nThis kept the king's coffers filled and, at the same time, still \nrestricted the use of the land to the upper class and a relatively \nsmall number of peasants.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter six months, the king summoned Thomas to report.  \"Well, my \nRoyal Forester, is my plan working as expected?\" asked the king.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, your highness,\" replied Thomas.  \"Revenues are as projected.\"  \nThe king was obviously pleased.  Added Thomas, \"There was one \nproblem, but I managed to solve it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas described how there were not enough noblemen to maintain the \nbudgeted revenues and how he allowed some local peasants use of the \nland at a discounted rate.  The king listened intently and offered an \noccasional \"Uh-huh,\" or \"Yes, I see.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following morning Thomas was hanged for treason.\u0014\nTom O'Keefe, writing in Magazine Week\u0014",

The marriage \nrate has fluctuated in the past, with dips in the 1930s and 1960s, \nbut it has been in steady decline since the 1970s. Now, researchers \nreport that the marriage rate has dropped to a new low of 31.1, \nmeaning there are about 31 marriages in the U.S. for every 1,000 \nunmarried women, researchers found. In 1950, that number was 90.2. In \n1920, it was 92.3. \"Marriage is no longer compulsory,\" said study \nresearcher Susan Brown, co-director of the National Center for Family \nand Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. \"It's just \none of an array of options. Increasingly, many couples choose to \ncohabit and still others prefer to remain single.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTo calculate the marriage rate, researchers look at the percentage of \nwomen older than age 15 who get married each year, so the plummeting \nnumbers could also be explained, in part, by Americans delaying \nmarriage longer than they have in the past. A woman's average age at \nfirst marriage in the United States is now nearly 27, the highest in \nmore than a century, according to thereport. Still, among all \nAmerican women over 15, less than half (47 percent) are married \ntoday, the lowest since the turn of the 20th century, and down from a \npeak of 65 percent in 1950, the report found. On the other hand, the \nproportion of women who are separated or divorced is on the rise, at \n15 percent today, compared with less than 1 percent in 1920, the \nresearchers say.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 7/23/13\u0014",

    "title": "USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN YOUR CHURCH",
    "words": "Using Social \nMedia in Your Church\u0014\n\u0014\nFeb 13, 2014  Social Media    Ed Stetzer blog\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can churches leverage social media for kingdom work? \u0014\n\u0014\n rise of social media has provided for churches both challenges and \nopportunities. Long-lost connections have been restored giving way to \nextra-marital affairs. Marriages have suffered as one spouse or the \nother has been lost in a world of faux-farms, patience challenged \nfowl, or tales of crushed candies. \"Fasting\" from social media has \nbecome as common as nuns staying away from romance or Tweedledum \navoiding the gym.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other side are those who have pondered how social media might \nbe used as a means to spread the gospel. As Clark Campbell said on \nthis blog in January:\u0014\n\u0014\n[Social media] is a tool for interaction and connection, not merely a \nmegaphone to announce the next church program and party. Social media \nopens doors and opportunities to engage with people who rarely, if \never, step foot in a church building.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can your church use social media?\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Facebook searches are influenced by friends \"likes\" on Facebook.\u0014\n\u0014\nSays Danny Sullivan on Search Engine Land:\u0014\n\u0014\nWith Facebook Graph Search, the objects we search for aren't Web \npages but instead virtual representations of real world objects: \npeople, places and things. The connections are primarily Facebook \nLikes. Did such-and-such a person like a particular photo? A \nparticular doctor? A particular restaurant? Those likes are the ties \nthat bind the information in Facebook together.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reviewer calls it the \"friend powered engine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne way to take advantage of Facebook search is to get every person \nin your church to like your church's page, then encourage them to \nsuggest liking your church page to their friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink of it like this: When a person moves to your town, they may use \nGoogle or Bing to find a church. But after they have been in the \ncommunity for a while, have made friends and have connections on \nFacebook, they may use Facebook search instead. The number of people \nwho have liked your church's Facebook page can influence the search \nresults.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Your church need not be on Twitter, but your pastoral staff needs \nto be.\u0014\n\u0014\nMen and students populate the Twitterverse making it a great place to \ninteract and inform. Tweeting about big time events (Superbowl, World \nSeries, the Olympics) allow much cross-communication with those who \nmay not know Christ. Using hashtags for a sermon series \n(#GenerousLiving) allows members to find what others are saying. \nNon-members can see it, too.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. A pastoral blog\u0014\n\u0014\nMany, many pastors I know blog. Blogs are a way to add to or prepare \nmembers for a sermon, address an issue not in an upcoming sermon, \nshare a devotional thought, and point members to other web content. I \nthink blogging can make pastors better preachers as it helps one \nrefine thoughts and have a focus on clarity.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Even with social media, do not overlook your website.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong gone are the days of using the Yellow Pages or the Church \nDirectory from the newspaper. Today people use Google, Bing, Yahoo or \nother search engine. If your church does not have a website, or if it \nlooks like it was assembled with wheat straw and baling wire, you may \nlose guests before they ever step foot on your campus. Often when \nsearchers find your Facebook page, the next thing they do is click \nthe link to your website. If the site is out of date they will assume \nthe same thing about your church. (The will assume the same thing if \nyou do not have a Facebook page or if that page is a digital \nwasteland.)\u0014\n\u0014\nYour website must be visually appealing and easy to navigate. The \nlanding page should be oriented toward non-members rather than \nmembers. Do not load the landing page with announcements, activity \nlists, a Twitter feed and the like. Create a member area for \nsign-ups, announcements and calendars. Make the landing page (home \npage) attractive, clean, and, above all, easy to navigate. Directions \nto your campus, service times and contact information should be in \nplain view. (Also, the site should be mobile friendly since people \nincreasingly access the Internet on mobile devices even from home.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial media, like TV, radio and other technologies, are tools to be \nused for good or bad. The intent of the user says much about the \neffect of the tool. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs and other \nsocial media, may be used by churches and believers to impact a dying \nworld with the gospel. Says author Andy Crouch:\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches should find ways to use social media to do what you most \ncare about doing well. They just have to be who they are...It can be \ndone beautifully; it can be done well. It's an opportunity to bear \nwitness to things we care about anyway.\u0014",

    "words": "Sometimes, if you will just wait, problems take care of themselves. \nJ. Arthur Rank had a system for doing that. He was one of the early \npioneers of the film industry in Great Britain, and he also happened \nto be a devout Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nRank found he couldn't push his worries out of his mind completely; \nthey were always slipping back in. So he finally made a pact with God \nto limit his worrying to Wednesday. He even made himself a little \nWednesday Worry Box and he placed it on his desk. Whenever a worry \ncropped up, Rank wrote it out and dropped it into the Wednesday Worry \nBox. \u0014\n\u0014\nWould you like to know his amazing discovery? When Wednesday rolled \naround, he would open that box to find that only a third of the items \nhe had written down were still worth worrying about. The rest had \nmanaged to resolve themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you have a troubled heart, ask God to give you a new perspective. \nAlso ask Him to give you patience so you do not jump ahead and worry \nabout a problem that may never come. Most important of all, ask God \nfor more faith. Faith in God is the best remedy for all our problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(King Duncan, Collected Sermons, adapted from Daily Bread, Dec. 1, \n1999\u0014",

    "words": "From Laura Hillenbrand, the bestselling author of Seabiscuit, comes \nUnbroken, the inspiring true story of a man who lived through a \nseries of catastrophes almost too incredible to be believed. In \nevocative, immediate descriptions, Hillenbrand unfurls the story of \nLouie Zamperini--a juvenile delinquent-turned-Olympic \nrunner-turned-Army hero. During a routine search mission over the \nPacific, Louies plane crashed into the ocean, and what happened to \nhim over the next three years of his life is a story that will keep \nyou glued to the pages, eagerly awaiting the next turn in the story \nand fearing it at the same time. Youll cheer for the man who somehow \nmaintained his selfhood and humanity despite the monumental \ndegradations he suffered, and youll want to share this book with \neveryone you know. --Juliet Disparte \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Story of Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand\u0014\n\u0014\nEight years ago, an old man told me a story that took my breath away. \nHis name was Louie Zamperini, and from the day I first spoke to him, \nhis almost incomprehensibly dramatic life was my obsession.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a horse--the subject of my first book, Seabiscuit: An American \nLegend--who led me to Louie. As I researched the Depression-era \nracehorse, I kept coming across stories about Louie, a 1930s track \nstar who endured an amazing odyssey in World War II. I knew only a \nlittle about him then, but I couldnt shake him from my mind. After I \nfinished Seabiscuit, I tracked Louie down, called him and asked about \nhis life. For the next hour, he had me transfixed.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing up in California in the 1920s, Louie was a hellraiser, \nstealing everything edible that he could carry, staging elaborate \npranks, getting in fistfights, and bedeviling the local police. But \nas a teenager, he emerged as one of the greatest runners America had \never seen, competing at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he put on a \nsensational performance, crossed paths with Hitler, and stole a \nGerman flag right off the Reich Chancellery. He was preparing for the \n1940 Olympics, and closing in on the fabled four-minute mile, when \nWorld War II began. Louie joined the Army Air Corps, becoming a \nbombardier. Stationed on Oahu, he survived harrowing combat, \nincluding an epic air battle that ended when his plane crash-landed, \nsome six hundred holes in its fuselage and half the crew seriously \nwounded.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a May afternoon in 1943, Louie took off on a search mission for a \nlost plane. Somewhere over the Pacific, the engines on his bomber \nfailed. The plane plummeted into the sea, leaving Louie and two other \nmen stranded on a tiny raft. Drifting for weeks and thousands of \nmiles, they endured starvation and desperate thirst, sharks that \nleapt aboard the raft, trying to drag them off, a machine-gun attack \nfrom a Japanese bomber, and a typhoon with waves some forty feet \nhigh. At last, they spotted an island. As they rowed toward it, \nunbeknownst to them, a Japanese military boat was lurking nearby. \nLouies journey had only just begun.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat first conversation with Louie was a pivot point in my life. \nFascinated by his experiences, and the mystery of how a man could \novercome so much, I began a seven-year journey through his story. I \nfound it in diaries, letters and unpublished memoirs; in the memories \nof his family and friends, fellow Olympians, former American airmen \nand Japanese veterans; in forgotten papers in archives as far-flung \nas Oslo and Canberra. Along the way, there were staggering surprises, \nand Louies unlikely, inspiring story came alive for me. It is a tale \nof daring, defiance, persistence, ingenuity, and the ferocious will \nof a man who refused to be broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe culmination of my journey is my new book, Unbroken: A World War \nII Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. I hope you are as \nspellbound by Louies life as I am.\u0014",

    "title": "UNBROKEN,  A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Starred Review. From the 1936 Olympics to WWII Japan's most brutal \nPOW camps, Hillenbrand's heart-wrenching new book is thousands of \nmiles and a world away from the racing circuit of her bestselling \nSeabiscuit. But it's just as much a page-turner, and its hero, Louie \nZamperini, is just as loveable: a disciplined champion racer who ran \nin the Berlin Olympics, he's a wit, a prankster, and a reformed \njuvenile delinquent who put his thieving skills to good use in the \nPOW camps, In other words, Louie is a total charmer, a lover of \nlife--whose will to live is cruelly tested when he becomes an Army \nAir Corps bombardier in 1941. The young Italian-American from \nTorrance, Calif., was expected to be the first to run a four-minute \nmile. After an astonishing but losing race at the 1936 Olympics, \nLouie was hoping for gold in the 1940 games. But war ended those \ndreams forever.\u0014\n\u0014\n In May 1943 his B-24 crashed into the Pacific. After a \nrecord-breaking 47 days adrift on a shark-encircled life raft with \nhis pal and pilot, Russell Allen \"Phil\" Phillips, they were captured \nby the Japanese. In the \"theater of cruelty\" that was the Japanese \nPOW camp network, Louie landed in the cruelest theaters of all: Omori \nand Naoetsu, under the control of Corp. Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a \npathologically brutal sadist (called the Bird by camp inmates) who \nnever killed his victims outright--his pleasure came from their slow, \nunending torment. After one beating, as Watanabe left Louie's cell, \nLouie saw on his face a \"soft languor.... It was an expression of \nsexual rapture.\" And Louie, with his defiant and unbreakable spirit, \nwas Watanabe's victim of choice. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy war's end, Louie was near death. When Naoetsu was liberated in \nmid-August 1945, a depleted Louie's only thought was \"I'm free! I'm \nfree! I'm free!\" But as Hillenbrand shows, Louie was not yet free. \nEven as, returning stateside, he impulsively married the beautiful \nCynthia Applewhite and tried to build a life, Louie remained in the \nBird's clutches, haunted in his dreams, drinking to forget, and \nobsessed with vengeance. In one of several sections where Hillenbrand \nsteps back for a larger view, she writes movingly of the thousands of \npostwar Pacific PTSD sufferers. With no help for their as yet \nunrecognized illness, Hillenbrand says, \"there was no one right way \nto peace; each man had to find his own path....\" \u0014\nThe book's final section is the story of how, with Cynthia's help, \nLouie found his path. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is impossible to condense the rich, granular detail of \nHillenbrand's narrative of the atrocities committed (one man was \nexhibited naked in a Tokyo zoo for the Japanese to \"gawk at his \nfilthy, sore-encrusted body\") against American POWs in Japan, and the \ncourage of Louie and his fellow POWs, who made attempts on Watanabe's \nlife, committed sabotage, and risked their own lives to save others. \nHillenbrand's triumph is that in telling Louie's story (he's now in \nhis 90s), she tells the stories of thousands whose suffering has been \nmostly forgotten. She restores to our collective memory this tale of \nheroism, cruelty, life, death, joy, suffering, remorselessness, and \nredemption. (Nov.) -Reviewed by Sarah F. Gold\u0014",

    "title": "UNBROKEN, ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE BOOK",
    "words": "Louis Zamperini? Who is he? Laura Hillenbrand's near 500-page reply \nwill answer the question not only once, but for all. He is the \nCalifornia boy who was a kleptomaniac. He is the running prodigy who \ncompeted at Hitler's Berlin Olympics, shook hands with the Fuhrer, \nand was almost shot by Nazi guards for stealing a Nazi souvenir. He \nis the American serviceman who entered the Pacific theater, crashed \ninto the sea, and spent a harrowing forty-odd days floating on a \ndisintegrating raft circled by aggressive sharks, scorched by a \nrelentless sun, and gnawed to the bone by an inescapable hunger.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho is Louis Zamperini? He is a man who overcame all THAT only to be \n\"rescued\" by the wrong side -- the Japanese. He is the man who went \nfrom being a prisoner of starvation and sharks that actually leaped \nup and tried to snatch him out of the foundering raft to being a \nprisoner of Japanese guards who were every bit as predatory as the \ngreat white of the seas. He is the man who was beaten every day by a \nparticular Japanese corporal named Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a.k.a. \"the \nBird.\" He is, in short, the Unbroken One -- the man who kept getting \nup, coming back, rebounding, and holding on to the tenuous thread \nthat connected him with life and hope, past any duration that any of \nus could possibly imagine. And, as YOU can imagine, his story is \ncompelling. In fact, in the capable hands of Laura Hillenbrand, \nauthor of SEABISCUIT, it reads like a thriller, a page-turner, a \nfictional product of a keenly talented mind -- proving once again \nthat truth can trump fiction when it comes to stories and mankind's \nlove of hearing them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you reach the end of this man's incredible journey, you will be \nawed by the scope of Hillenbrand's writing. It is clear that she did \na vast amount of research -- reading letters, telegrams, newspaper \nclippings, radio transcripts, etc., AND interviewing not only \nZamperini himself, but his family members, friends, surviving fellow \nservicemen, and even Japanese captors. Woven in her biography are \nmany statistics and facts from the history of World War II as well. \nYou will learn about the science of survival -- why certain men live \nand certain men die -- and about the strengths and weaknesses of \nAmerica's planes that carried servicemen over the vast distances of \nthe Pacific Ocean. You will learn about the war strategy, the \nJapanese culture and its effects on treatment of POWs as well as on \nconducting (and refusing to surrender in) a war to the bitter end. \nAnd, sadly, you will learn about the aftermath of war in Japan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's all here, bigger than life, packed into the small frame of one \nman from Torrance, California -- a man that could, and did, live to \ntell about a page in history we hope never to repeat. Both a personal \ntale of redemption and resilience, UNBROKEN is destined to become a \nclassic in the category of narrative nonfiction. Ordinarily I'm a \nfiction guy, but I was spellbound from the start. Honest. Give it a \ntry. It's big, but reads small. I think, when you reach the end, you, \ntoo, will sing its (and Louie's) praises (at 93, Zamperini is still \nalive and still \"Unbroken\"!).\u0014",

    "words": "William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet and playwright, and one of the \nforemost figures of 20th century literature. A pillar of both the \nIrish and British literary establishments, in his later years he \nserved as an Irish Senator for two terms. Yeats was a driving force \nbehind the Irish Literary Revival and, along with Lady Gregory, \nEdward Martyn, and others, founded the Abbey Theatre, where he served \nas its chief during its early years. In 1923 he was awarded the Nobel \nPrize in Literature as the first Irishman so honoured for what the \nNobel Committee described as \"inspired poetry, which in a highly \nartistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.\" \nYeats is generally considered one of the few writers who completed \ntheir greatest works after being awarded the Nobel Prize; such works \ninclude The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair and Other Poems \n(1929). Yeats was a very good friend of Indian Bengali poet Nobel \nlaureate Rabindranath Tagore. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, then a 23-year-old heiress and ardent \nNationalist. Gonne was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later \nclaimed she met the poet as a \"paint-stained art student.\" Gonne had \nadmired \"The Isle of Statues\" and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats \ndeveloped an obsessive infatuation with her beauty and outspoken \nmanner, and she was to have a significant and lasting effect on his \npoetry and his life thereafter. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn later years he admitted, \"it seems to me that she [Gonne] brought \ninto my life those daysfor as yet I saw only what lay upon the \nsurfacethe middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an \nover-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes.\" \nYeats' love initially remained unrequited, in part due to his \nreluctance to participate in her nationalist activism. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHis only other love affair during this period was with Olivia \nShakespear, whom he had first met in 1896, and parted with one year \nlater. In 1891, he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage, \nbut was rejected. He later admitted that from that point \"the \ntroubling of my life began\". Yeats proposed to Gonne three more \ntimes: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in \n1903, to his horror, married the Irish nationalist Major John \nMacBride. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were two main reasons why Yeats was so horrified. To lose his \nmuse to another made him look silly before the public. Yeats \nnaturally hated MacBride and continually sought to deride and demean \nhim both in his letters and his poetry. The second reason Yeats was \nhorrified was linked to the fact of Maud's conversion to Catholicism, \nwhich Yeats despised. He thought his muse would come under the \ninfluence of the priests and do their bidding. The marriage, as \nforecast by both their sets of friends and relations was an early \ndisaster. This pleased Yeats as Maud began to visit him in London. \nAfter the birth of her son, Sen MacBride, in 1904, she and MacBride \nagreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the \nchild's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case \nensued in Paris in 1905. Maud made a series of allegations against \nher husband with Yeats as her main 'second' though he did not attend \ncourt or travel to France. A divorce was not granted as the only \naccusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk \nonce during the marriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nA separation was granted with Maud having custody of the baby with \nJohn having visiting rights. Yeats' friendship with Gonne persisted, \nand, in Paris, in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \n\"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his \nlovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later \nremarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual \nvirginity of the soul.\" The relationship did not develop into a new \nphase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to \nthe poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they \ncould not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have \nall earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you \nas I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire \nfor me may be taken from you too.\" By January 1909, Gonne was sending \nYeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain \nfrom sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with \nGonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\": \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMy arms are like the twisted thorn \u0014\nAnd yet there beauty lay; \u0014\nThe first of all the tribe lay there \u0014\nAnd did such pleasure take; \u0014\nShe who had brought great Hector down \u0014\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.\u0014",

    "title": "U.S. BILL OF RIGHTS",
    "words": "In 1787 a convention in Philadelphia drafted what is usually \nrecognized as the most extraordinary political document of history. \nThe Constitution of the United States created a federal system with \nchecks and balances on power. The world had never seen anything like \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite its benefits, there was doubt it would be ratified by the \nindividual states. Having recently escaped one tyranny, the people of \nthe United States did not want to subject themselves to another. They \nfeared the new constitution because, while it specified the rights of \nthe new government, and gave such rights as the writ of habeas \ncorpus, it did not list other rights that the people felt it should. \nThese could be inferred, but the majority of Americans felt safer \nhaving them spelled out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the most part, those who were for the federal system were for the \nconstitution as it stood. Those who opposed a federal system, wanted \nmore guarantees of rights. Several state conventions asked for such a \nbill. Thomas Jefferson urged that they be given their wish. A \"bill \nof rights is what the people are entitled to against every government \non earth, general or particular, and what no just government should \nrefuse, or rest on inference.\" The U. S. Congress agreed and by a two \nthirds majority passed ten amendments to the constitution, called the \nBill of Rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified. It \nis significant to church history because of its first Amendment: \n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof..\" This amendment was the \nresult of long centuries of efforts by religious groups such as the \nQuakers and Baptists to obtain religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first amendment meant that the Federal government of the United \nStates could not establish a national church, such as was common in \nmany other nations. Anyone could worship as he or she pleased and the \nFederal government could not say \"boo\" except under special \ncircumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederal civil rights are not obligatory for states, however. At the \nstate level, established churches continued to exist for some years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany battles have been fought in the courts over just what this \namendment means. Today, when its words are used as an excuse to \nforbid children to pray in school or read a Bible on school property, \nit is good to remember that in the understanding of the generation \nthat adopted the amendment was not that the government should oppose \nreligion or deny it the same rights of expression enjoyed by other \norganizations, but rather that it not impose a national religion nor \nstop people from engaging in their preferred form of worship. It \nguaranteed freedom for worship, not freedom from religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bill of Rights in the United States of America.\" \nhttp://www.magnacartaplus.org/usa-rights/\u0014\nBowen, Catherine Drinker.

The data indicate that \ntheir shift was evenly split, the report said. Half of them fell \naway from consistent faith engagement, essentially becoming \nnon-practicing Christians, while the other half moved into the \nnon-Christian segment. This shift also contributed to the growth of \nthe atheist / agnostic / none segment, which has nearly doubled in \nsize during this same amount of time.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeekly church attendance has also declined in recent decades. \nAttendance has ebbed and flowed since 45% of U.S. adults reported \nattending each week in 1993.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter declining to 37% in 1996, reported attendance rose to 48% by \n2009, before beginning a steady decline over the next eight years, \nreaching a low of 27% in 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\nReported attendance rose to 33% the next year, before dropping back \nto 29% in 2019 and 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\nElders (born before 1946) are the most faithful churchgoers, with 37% \nattending weekly, followed by boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) at \n32%, Gen-Xers (born between 1965 and 1983) at 29% and millennials \n(born between 1984 and 1998) at 25%.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther indicators such as daily prayer and daily Bible reading have \nalso seen declines, after seeing increases and high points during the \n2000s.\u0014",

    "words": "Under Half of US Adults Affiliate with House of Faith\u0014\nby Zach Dawes Jr | Mar 30, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nFewer than half of U.S. adults now claim membership in a church, \nmosque or synagogue, according to a Gallup report published March 29.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the first time in polling history when a majority has not \ndone so, following a decades-long membership decline.\u0014\n\u0014\nGallup began polling on this question in 1937, when 73% said they \nwere members of a house of faith. That number ticked up to 76% over \nthe next decade before stabilizing at 73% until the mid-70s when \nmembership dropped slightly to 71%.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1977-99, membership was relatively consistent, moving between \n71% and 68% before seeing a steady downward trend over the next two \ndecades. In 2020, 47% of U.S. adults claimed membership in a church, \nmosque or synagogue.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile all age groups have seen a decline, membership is significantly \nlower among younger adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 2018-20, an average of 36% of Millennials (born 1981-96) said \nthey were part of a house of faith, compared to 50% of Generation X \n(born 1965-80), 58% of Baby Boomers (born 1946-64) and 66% of \nTraditionalists (born before 1946), during the same period.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillennials average membership dropped 15 points between 2008-10 and \n2018-20, compared to seven points for Generation X, five points for \nBaby Boomers and seven points for Traditionalists.\u0014\n\u0014\nA key part of this membership trend is that the number of adults who \nclaim no faith affiliation has been increasing across all age groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the turn of the century, there has been a near doubling in the \npercentage of Traditionalists (from 4% to 7%), Baby Boomers (from 7% \nto 13%) and Gen Xers (11% to 20%) with no religious affiliation, the \nreport said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince 2008-10, Millennials claiming no religious affiliation have \nincreased nine points to 31%.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese increases account for more than half of the membership decline, \nwith the other portion resulting from a drop in the number of \nrespondents who claim a faith tradition but are not members of a \nchurch, mosque or synagogue.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince 2008-10, membership among Traditionalists who affiliate with a \nreligious tradition has dropped six points to 72%, compared to a \nfour-point decline for Baby Boomers (down to 65%), eight points for \nGeneration X (to 60%) and 13 points for Millennials (to 50%).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. remains a religious nation, with more than seven in 10 \naffiliating with some type of organized religion. However, far fewer, \nnow less than half, have a formal membership with a specific house of \nworship, the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it is possible that part of the decline seen in 2020 was \ntemporary and related to the coronavirus pandemic, continued decline \nin future decades seems inevitable, given the much lower levels of \nreligiosity and church membership among younger versus older \ngenerations of adults.\u0014\n\u0014\n info@goodfaithmedia.org\u0014",

    "words": "US Homelessness Continues Inching Upward\u0014\nby Zach Dawes Jr | Apr 30, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than half a million people in the U.S. were homeless in early \nJanuary 2020, according to a U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \nreport published last month.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 580,466 people counted during HUDs annual point-in-time \nassessment is a 2.2% (12,751-person) rise from 2019  an increase HUD \nSecretary Marcia L. Fudge called very troubling since it doesnt \nfactor in the impacts of the pandemic.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoint-in-Time Counts are unduplicated one-night estimates of both \nsheltered and unsheltered homeless populations. The one-night counts \nare conducted  during the last week in January of each year, the \nreport explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the total number of unhoused persons, 61% spent the night in \nemergency shelters or transitional housing while 39% did so in \nunsheltered locations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the fourth year in a row that the total number of unhoused \npersons increased, and it is the first time that there was a bigger \nincrease in the number of unhoused people staying in unsheltered \nlocations (up 7% from 2019 to 2020) than those who spent the night in \nsheltered locations (down 0.6%).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis same pattern was repeated in several subgroups.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the percentage both of families with children and of \nmilitary veterans staying in unsheltered locations increased from \n2019 to 2020, even as the overall levels of homelessness among both \ngroups remained steady.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain groups continue to be overrepresented among the unhoused.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Blacks accounted for 39% of the U.S. homeless population \nin the 2020 count while comprising 12% of the total population, and \nHispanics represent 16% of the U.S. population but made up 23% of the \nhomeless population.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, though collectively making up 1% of the U.S. population, \nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders and Native \nHawaiians comprised 5% of the homeless counted in 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the exception of 2009-10, overall homeless levels in the annual \npoint-in-time counts declined each year from 2007 to 2016, falling \nfrom 647,258 to 549,928, before reversing course in the past four \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe overall increase is due to a steady rise in the number of \nhomeless persons spending the night in unsheltered locations  up to \n226,080 in 2020 from a low of 173,268 in 2015.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this same time, the unhoused staying in sheltered locations \ndeclined from 391,440 to 354,386.\u0014",

After more than two unthinkably harrowing \nmonths, 16 of the 45 who boarded the plane will be rescuedand \nsometimes referred to as the Miracle in the Andes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe plane had been chartered to fly the Old Christians Rugby Club of \nMontevideo, Uruguay to a match in Santiago. 19 of those aboard were \nmembers of the team, while most of the other passengers were friends \nand family of team members. Flying through the cloud-obscured \nmountains, the co-pilot began his descent prematurely. Survivors \nrecalled feeling turbulence before a black ridge appeared directly in \nfront of the plane. The pilot tried to fly straight up and over the \nridge, but the plane nonetheless hit the mountain, breaking into \nseveral pieces and skidding until coming to rest on a glacier. 12 \npeople died in the crash, including the pilot, and five more died \nshortly thereafter, including the co-pilot who had been operating the \ncontrols. Within an hour of the crash, the Chilean Air Search and \nRescue Service had planes in the air looking for survivors, but it \nwould be 72 days they were found.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn their eleventh day in the mountains, the survivors learned via a \nmakeshift radio that the search had been called off. They quickly ran \nout of food. As survivor Roberto Canessa remembered, After just a \nfew days, we were feeling the sensation of our own bodies consuming \nthemselves just to remain alive.  We knew the answer, but it was too \nterrible to contemplate. Eventually, after prayer and \nheart-wrenching deliberation, all but one agreed that the solution \nwas to eat the dead. It is a virtual certainty that all those \nremaining would have died had they not resorted to cannibalism. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the seventeenth day, an avalanche struck the fuselage of the \nplane, where the survivors were taking shelter, killing eight more \nand nearly burying the rest alive. On November 15, an expedition of \nfour set out in an attempt to find help by heading into a nearby \nvalley. Although they were forced to turn back, they did find the \ntail of the wrecked plane, which contained a small amount of food and \nmedicine as well as comic books.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnderstanding, based on the failure of the first expedition, that the \nonly way to reach help would be to climb the mountain that lay to the \nWest, the survivors knit insulation from the airplane into a sleeping \nbag that could protect Canessa, Nando Parrado and Antonio Vizintn, \nwho were chosen for the second expedition. After a grueling three-day \nclimb, Parrado and Canessa reached the summit, where they learned \nthat they were deeper into the mountains than they had expectedtheir \nassumption that they were close to Curic, Chile had been based on \nthe same navigational error that had caused the crash in the first \nplace. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf the 45 people on the plane, 12 died in the crash or shortly \nthereafter; another five had died by the next morning, and one more \nsuccumbed to injuries on the eighth day. The remaining 27 faced \nsevere difficulties in surviving high in the freezing mountains. Many \nhad suffered injuries from the crash, including broken legs from the \naircraft's seats piling together. The survivors lacked equipment such \nas cold-weather clothing and footwear suitable for the area, \nmountaineering goggles to prevent snow blindness (although one of the \neventual survivors, 24-year-old Adolfo \"Fito\" Strauch, devised a \ncouple of sunglasses by using the sun visors in the pilot's cabin \nwhich helped protect their eyes from the sun). They lacked any kind \nof medical supplies, and the death of Dr. Francisco Nicola left a \nfirst and a second year medical students who had survived the crash \nin charge to improvise splints and braces with salvaged parts of what \nremained of the aircraft.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally fed up with the extremely low temperatures and the avalanche \nthreats, as well as anguished by the continuos deaths of their \npartners and the bad rescue prospects, two of them decided to cross \nthe huge mountains to reach Chile. Rescuers did not learn of the \nsurvivors until 72 days after the crash when passengers Nando Parrado \nand Roberto Canessa, after a 10-day trek across the Andes, found a \nChilean huaso, who gave them food and then alerted authorities about \nthe existence of the other survivors.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 22nd of December of 1972, after being isolated for 72 days, the \nWorld found out and knew there were 16 survivors that beat Death in \nthe Andes mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain that they were going to their deaths, Parrado and Canessa \nhiked onward for nine more days, eventually following a river down \ninto a valley where they were able to find help. After being rescued \nby a local muleteer, they guided two Chilean Air Force helicopters to \nthe crash site, where half the survivors were evacuated on December \n22 and the rest were evacuated on the morning of the 23rd.\u0014",

    "title": "ULRICH ZWINGLI--CREATIVE, COMBATIVE AND CONTROVERSIAL",
    "words": "Switzerlands Original Reformer Was Creative, Combative, and \nFrequently Controversial\u0014\nA new biography captures the misunderstood faith of Huldrych Zwingli.\u0014\n\u0014\nSCOTT M. MANETSCH   MAY 23, 2022  CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\nHuldrych Zwingli (14841531) has not usually fared well at the hands \nof historians. Whether cast as Martin Luthers antagonist or as John \nCalvins (largely forgotten) understudy, the Zurich reformer has been \nwidely misunderstood, oftentimes vilified, and frequently ignored. \nEven in death, Zwingli proved to be controversial: Though a fierce \nopponent of the Swiss mercenary system, he perished in battle, sword \nin hand, seeking to extend Reformed Christianity to neighboring \nCatholic territories.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his insightful new biography, Zwingli: Gods Armed Prophet, \nhistorian Bruce Gordon offers a compelling interpretation of this \n16th-century preacher, theologian, political strategist, and \nself-styled prophet, demonstrating that Zwinglis creative vision of \nchurch, sacrament, and sacred community forged a new form of \nChristianity that came to be known as the Reformed faith. For Gordon, \nZwinglis creative but combative leadership in Zurich proved to be \nremarkably generative, fecund, and destructive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe embattled reformer\u0014\nBorn in the high Alpine village of Wildhaus on January 1, 1484, the \nboy Huldrych Zwingli grew up in a world of subsistence farming, \nCatholic piety, and stunning natural beauty. From an early age, he \ndeveloped a deep attachment to the Swiss Confederation, its land and \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwinglis formal schooling took him to Basel, Bern, Vienna, and then \nback to Basel (where he earned a bachelors degree in 1504 and a \nmasters in 1506). This academic journey instilled in him a permanent \nlove for humanistic learning, including the study of classical Greek \nand Roman literature, the mastery of the biblical languages, and the \napplication of Scripture for the renewal of church and society. \nSomewhat later, in 1514 or 1515, Zwingli was introduced to the \nwritings of the famous Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, whose \nbiblical scholarship and Christ-centered piety played a significant \nrole in Zwinglis emerging reformist convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrdained to the priesthood in 1506, Zwingli served parishes in Glarus \nand Einsiedeln over the next 12 years. During this period, he \nwitnessed firsthand the brutality of war and became an outspoken \ncritic of the mercenary system and the pensions paid to wealthy Swiss \ncitizens who recruited the mercenaries. Zwingli also cultivated a \ngrowing network of friends and fellow humanists, including Joachim \nVadian, Heinrich Glarean, and Erasmus.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli was known as a conscientious priest who supported the papal \nparty, studied early-church writings, loved music, and excelled as a \npreacher. He also had the reputation for being promiscuous, a \nfrequent visitor to the local brothel. According to Gordon, it was \nduring his years in Einsiedeln that Zwingli experienced a kind of \nreligious conversion when, following Erasmuss lead, he began looking \nto Scripture as the highest authority in the Christian life. It was \nErasmus more than Luther who contributed to Zwinglis religious \nawakening.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwinglis popularity as a preacher gained the attention of Zurichs \nmagistrates, and on January 1, 1519, he assumed his new duties as the \npeoples priest in the city. In this capacity, Zwingli preached \nsuccessively through texts of Scripture several times each week from \nthe pulpit of Zurichs Grossmnster Church. Over the next six years, \nthe pulpit served as Zwinglis primary platform for promoting \nreligious change, as he became increasingly critical of medieval \ndevotional practices, including the veneration of Mary and the \nsaints, Lenten fasts, the use of religious images, clerical celibacy, \nand transubstantiation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1522, Zwingli took the fateful step of marrying Anna Reinhart and \nthen resigned from the priesthoodonly to be reappointed as a city \npreacher. Gordon shows that, throughout this dramatic period, Zwingli \ndemonstrated real skill as a political strategist: While staging \npublic provocations with his combative sermons and inflammatory \npublished writings, he and his allies consistently submitted to the \nleadership of Zurichs political authorities. Thus, it was the \nmagistrates, not the bishop or city clergy, who convened and judged \nthe First and Second Disputations, held in the summer and fall of \n1523at which Zwingli and his views emerged victorious. As Gordon \nnotes, The Reformation [in Zurich] was a movement not of the people, \nbut of educated men working within the system.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the mass was abolished and Zurich became an evangelical city in \nthe spring of 1525, Zwingli encouraged and cooperated with the \nmagistrates as they moved swiftly to stamp out religious dissenters, \nboth Catholics and Anabaptists. Throughout these years, his \nself-perception as Gods prophet took shape: The prophet was one whom \nGod called, and the Spirit illuminated, to defend divine \nrighteousness and instruct the community through the public \nexposition of the Scriptures. This prophetic ideal took institutional \nshape in 1525, when Zwingli inaugurated the Prophezei, a regular \ngathering of ministers and theological students who studied the \nScriptures together in the original languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1520s, Zwingli gradually developed his original version of \nChristianity, articulated in works such as the Sixty-Seven Articles \n(1523) and the Commentary on True and False Religion (1525), and \nexpressed in Zurichs religious establishment. According to Gordon, \nthis reformed vision included several distinct aspects: The temporal \nand the sacred spheres formed a single religious community (corpus \nChristianum), with the visible church under the authority of the \ncitys godly magistrates. Moral renewal required purging the churches \nof idols and adopting a simple form of worship following the \npattern of Scripture. The two sacraments, baptism and the Lords \nSupper, were no longer thought to impart grace but were understood as \nsymbols of Gods work in Christ. Undergirding this theological vision \nwere two of Zwinglis bedrock convictions: that Gods timeless \ncovenant with his elect people entailed the positive use of divine \nlaw in the Christian life, and that Gods Word was powerful to \ntransform both individuals and society.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than the pastor of a single city, Zwingli emerged after 1525 as \na leading figure in a network of like-minded reformers (including \nVadian, Johannes Oecolampaius, Martin Bucer, and Wolfgang Capito) who \nwere intent on bringing religious change to southern Germany as well \nas to the Swiss Confederation. What Gordon calls the commanding \nmoment for Zwingli was at the Disputation of Bern (1528), when he \nand his colleagues convinced the Bernese magistrates to abolish the \nmass and embrace the evangelical faith. The next year, Zwingli and \nLuther locked horns at the Marburg Colloquy, failing to find \nconsensus on the contentious question of the nature of Christs \npresence in the Lords Supper. Gordon does not take sides in this \ndebate, but does observe that the Reformation, even in its earliest \nyears, never enjoyed an arcadian age of peace and unity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the last years of his life, Zwingli became increasingly isolated \nboth theologically and politically as he refused all compromise and \naggressively pursued the expansion of the Reformed faith to Catholic \nterritories through force of arms. His death on the battlefield of \nKappel on October 11, 1531, was the tragic consequence of his own \nbelligerence. Indeed, as Gordon observes, Zwinglis violent death \ncast a long shadow over his legacy  for centuries to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordon devotes his final chapters to tracing this troubled legacy, \ndescribing the variety of ways that 16th-century contemporaries as \nwell as modern scholars and filmmakers have sought to make sense of \nit. For Gordon, Zwingli is best remembered as neither a hero nor a \nmartyr, but as an embattled prophet.\u0014\n\u0014\nA reformer remembered\u0014\nFor too long, the Zurich Reformation and the life of Zwingli have \nremained unfamiliar territory for English-speaking readers. Gordons \nmagisterial biography does much to fix this shortcoming.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordons skills as a first-rate historian are on display throughout \nthis volume as he explores the dynamic relationship between high \ntheology, political factors, and everyday social realities that \nshaped Zwinglis experience and leadership as a reformer. This rich \ncontextual reading provides a portrait of Zwingli that is noteworthy \nfor its jarring inconsistencies, complexity, and sheer fascination.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book takes seriously Zwinglis development and contribution as a \ntheologian. Gordon devotes one of his chapters to providing a \nsuccinct and insightful summary of Zwinglis theology through the \nlens of his most comprehensive work, the Commentary on True and False \nReligion. Gordon is especially helpful in showing ways that Zwinglis \ndistinctive theological viewshis commitment to moral renewal, simple \nworship, sacramental symbolism, and a town hall-centered \nreformationappealed to the civic ideals of many of Zurichs \ninhabitants. Clearly, Zwinglis theology not only shaped, but was \nshaped by the urban context in which he served. (At the same time, \none is left wondering about the exegetical and patristic sources \nunderlying his distinctive theological views.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother strength of Gordons analysis is the manner in which he \nsituates Zwinglis reform efforts within the extensive network of \nfriends and allies who served alongside him in Zurich and beyond. \nEven in his dramatic confrontation with Luther at Marburg, Zwingli \nwas not a solitary reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Gordons portrait of Zwingli as a self-styled prophet \nleaves the reader with questions about the nature of this office. Did \nthe Zurich reformer distinguish his prophetic gifts from those of \nother reformed pastors? If Zwingli believed that he had received the \nWord as divine illumination through the Spirit (as Gordon indicates), \nin what ways did he distinguish his prophetic gift from those of the \nOld Testament prophetsif at all?\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly, the greatest strength of Gordons outstanding biography is \nthat it allows readers to discover this complex reformer on his own \ntermsas a charismatic preacher, a creative theologian, a political \nstrategist, a flawed reformer, and, to the end, an embattled prophet.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nScott M.

    "words": "Understanding Loneliness \u0014\n\u0014\nLoneliness is an unpleasant emotion that often coincides with \nisolation. And its not just physical isolation. It can be the social \npain that comes from being in a group of people who all seem to have \nsomething in common  except for you. \u0014\n\u0014\nLoneliness can last for a moment, an hour, a day or a week. But \nongoing loneliness that lasts several weeks or more is a greater risk \nduring the winter months. This type of loneliness has a significant \nimpact on physical and mental health. It can lead to depression, \nsleep disorders, substance abuse and serious illness. \u0014\n\u0014\nSigns and symptoms of chronic or prolonged loneliness include: \u0014\n\u0014\ninability to connect deeply with others, even with old friends or \nfamily \u0014\nthe feeling that no one is close to you or truly understands you \u0014\nan overwhelming feeling of isolation no matter where you are \u0014\nnegative thoughts of self-doubt and self-worth \u0014\nnot feeling heard, even when you reach out \u0014\nexhaustion and burnout when trying to engage \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Does the Bible Say About Loneliness?  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible contains many examples of Scriptural loneliness. David was \nwell-acquainted with it. Several Psalms can be found expressing his \nloneliness, like Psalm 25:16-21: Turn to me and be gracious to me, \nfor I am lonely and afflicted. Relieve the troubles of my heart, and \nbring me out of my distress (25:16-17, NRSV). \u0014\n\u0014\nGods prophets often suffered deep loneliness as they were rejected \nand abused for what they were saying. Jeremiah was instructed not to \nmarry. He had few friends and is often called the weeping prophet \nby Bible scholars.  \u0014\n\u0014\nEven Jesus must have felt lonely after 40 days of fasting in the \nwilderness. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut God has answers for loneliness. He often makes deep connections \nwith believers who reach out to Him in their time of need. He doesnt \nexpect us to be impervious to tough feelings, He simply asks us to \nreach out to Him and trust Him when these feelings overcome us. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst Peter 5:6-7 (ESV) says Humble yourselves, therefore, under the \nmighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, \ncasting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.\u0014",

    "words": "U.S. Protestant population seen losing majority status\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Joyce Howard Price\u0014\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States will lose its historic status as a \nmajority-Protestant nation as early as this year, according to a \nnational survey released yesterday.(July 22, 2004)\u0014\n  \u0014\nBetween 1993 and 2002, the proportion of Americans who said they were \nProtestants fell from 63 percent to 52 percent after decades of \nstability, according to the study released by the National Opinion \nResearch Center at the University of Chicago.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Since Colonial times, the United States has been a Protestant \nnation. But this year or next, the proportion of all Protestants will \nfall below 50 percent\" of the total U.S. population for the first \ntime, said Tom Smith, director of NORC's General Social Survey, which \nmeasures public trends. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe NORC survey identifies Protestants as \"any post-Reformation \nChristian denomination,\" including some groups, such as the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and Jehovah's Witnesses, \nalthough their theologies differ substantially from those of most \nChristians and they are not universally viewed as Protestant. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the United States \"has been seen as white and Protestant, we're \nnot going to be majority Protestant any longer,\" added Mr. Smith, \nco-author of the study titled \"The Vanishing Protestant Majority.\" \u0014\nMainline Protestant churches, such as United Methodist, Presbyterian \nand Episcopal, have been losing members for years, but those losses \nhave been cushioned by gains in the number of people joining \nevangelical or fundamentalist denominations. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Some evangelical faiths are growing, while none of the major liberal \nProtestant denominations are,\" Mr. Smith said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"But with the exception of Southern Baptists,\" the largest Protestant \ndenomination with more than 16 million members, he said, \"most \nevangelical denominations are quite small,\" so any gains they have \nmade in members have not increased the total number of Protestants in \nthe United States today. \u0014\nKey factors in the decline of Protestantism are as follows, according \nto the NORC report: \u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of Americans who said they had no religion rose from 9 \npercent in 1993 to 14 percent in 2002. Many in this group were former \nProtestants. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans who said they belonged to religions other than \nChristianity or Judaism rose from 3 percent to 7 percent between 1993 \nand 2002. Other religions included Islam, Orthodox Christianity, \nBuddhism and other Eastern faiths, and those who describe themselves \nas inter-denominational. \u0014\n\u0014\nLarge numbers of young people and adults have been leaving \nProtestant denominations, as the number of non-Protestant immigrants \nincreased, making up a greater share of the population. \u0014\n\u0014\nA lower percentage of U.S. residents are being raised as \nProtestants. Surveys indicate that 55 percent of U.S. adults today \nwere raised as Protestants. But in the early 1980s, 67 percent to 68 \npercent of U.S. adults were raised in Protestant households. \u0014\n\u0014\nFewer U.S. Protestants are maintaining their faith as adults. In the \n1970s through 1993, Protestant denominations enjoyed a retention rate \nof 90 percent or more. But since then, retention has remained in the \n80 percent range. \u0014\n\u0014\nc A growing number of Americans who have become inactive in \nProtestant denominations are describing themselves as Christians, \nrather than Protestants. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"About 2 percent of Americans today are what we call generic \nChristians. That's up from less than 1/2 percent who described \nthemselves that way\" a decade ago, Mr. Smith said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNORC is not the only national research or polling organization whose \ndata indicate Protestantism is close to losing its majority status. \nSimilar findings have come from the Gallup Poll, the 1988-2002 \nNational Election Studies (NES); and the 1990 and 2001 American \nReligious Identification Studies (ARIS).\u0014\n\u0014\nFrank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, which tracks \nreligious affiliation, said yesterday that in his group's survey, \n\"the percentage who say they are Protestant is getting close to the \n50 percent level. It was 51 percent in 2003.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAs recently as 1996 or 1997, the proportion of Protestants was 58 \npercent, he said. \u0014\n\"It's not that people are abandoning Christianity. They may just be \nabandoning the label Protestant,\" Mr. Newport added. \u0014\n\u0014\nFigures from both Gallup and NORC indicate Roman Catholics make up \nabout 25 percent of the total U.S. population, a statistic that has \nremained stable for decades, and that Jews constitute 2 percent. \u0014\nAsked why the percentage of Catholics has not risen, given all the \nimmigrants that have come from Mexico and other Latin American \ncountries, Mr. Newport said that Hispanics arrive in this country as \nCatholics, but do not always retain their Catholic roots. However, \nRoman Catholicism remains the nation's largest Christian faith, with \nmore than 65.2 million members. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike NORC, Mr. Newport says Gallup has found no evidence that the \npercentage of Americans with no religion is climbing. Gallup data \nindicate the share of those with no religion remains at 9 percent, \nwhere it was in 1992. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Smith of NORC said Gallup stands alone with its finding that \nthe number of nonbelievers has remained flat and said he is convinced \nGallup is wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nGallup does not include Mormons in its Protestant category. But its \n\"other\" religion category accounts for 13 percent of the total. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"An increasing number of people are saying they are something other \nthan Protestant ... but some [who identify themselves as 'other'] \ncould actually be Protestant,\" Mr. Newport said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Washington Times, 7/23/04\u0014",

    "words": "From Publishers Weekly\u0014\nYankoski's parents were right: It was crazy to live as a homeless \nperson in six American cities for five months; fortunately, this \ncrazy idea makes for quite a story. Yankoski, a Christian college \nstudent, challenges the reader to learn about faith, identify with \nthe poor and find \"more forgotten, ruined, beautiful people than we \never imagined existed, and more reason to hope in their redemption.\" \nThe journey begins at a Denver rescue mission and ends on a \nCalifornia beach. Along the way, Yankoski and a friend learn the \nperils of poor hygiene and the secrets of panhandling. They meet \nunfortunates like Andrew, who squanders his musical talent to feed \nhis drug habit, and hustlers like Jake, who gives the pair tips about \nhow to look and sound more pitiful to get more money. Yankoski tends \nto moralize: \"If we respond to others based on their outward \nappearance, haven't we entirely missed the point of the Gospel?\" \nStill, the book features fine writing (\"I awoke, rolled over and saw \nbeads of sweat already forming on my arms. Saturday, early morning, \nPhoenix\") and vivid stories, authentically revealing an underworld of \nneed. (Apr.)\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom School Library Journal\u0014\nAdult/High School-As a college student in Santa Barbara, Yankoski was \ncomfortable with his life. However, listening to a Sunday sermon one \nmorning, he began to wonder whether his faith would remain as strong \nif his privileged upbringing and typical college existence were taken \naway. So began his decision to put his faith to the test. After \ndiscussing his plans with his family and various advisors, he and a \nfriend took a leave of absence from their studies and their \nmiddle-class lives to enter the world of the homeless. They spent \nfive months in 2003 on the streets of Denver; Phoenix; Washington, \nDC; and other cities. Playing their guitars and panhandling, they \nrelied entirely on charity. The harshness, hunger, dangers, and \nindignities they faced are reported in detail. They formed \nfriendships with other homeless people and watched many of them \nstruggle with alcoholism and drug addiction. Yankoski steers clear of \npreachy or patronizing tones, and his dry sense of humor makes the \nbook thoroughly readable. Teens will appreciate the frankness with \nwhich he approaches the day-to-day challenges and his personal \nstruggles.-Kim Dare, Fairfax County Public Library System, VA\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom AudioFile\u0014\nThe phrases \"God's will be done\" and \"God will provide\" take on new \nmeaning when one is homeless and jobless. This is what the authors \nexperienced when they spent months on the streets as homeless men, \nplaying their guitars and singing praise songs for food money and \nsleeping in sleeping bags wherever they felt safe. Yankoski's \nconversational tone is enjoyable but sometimes becomes too casual in \nits diction, which can make understanding difficult for listeners. He \nis much clearer when he reads Bible passages. Purvis does the other \nvoices well. He varies his speech patterns without affectation to \ndifferentiate the people they talk to. R.C.G. AudioFile, Portland, \nMaine-- Copyright  AudioFile, Portland, Maine--This text refers to \nthe Audio CD edition.\u0014\n\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\nAfter meals from garbage cans and dumpsters, night after night Mike \nand Sam found their beds under bridges and on the streets. They were \nforced to depend on the generosity and kindness of strangers as they \npanhandled to sustain their existence. For more than five months, the \npair experienced firsthand the extreme pains of hunger, the constant \nuncertainty and danger of living on the streets, exhaustion, \ndepression, and social rejection - and all of this by their own \nchoice. This is their story. Through Mike's firsthand account, Under \nthe Overpass provides important insight into the truths of the street \nand calls the younger generation of believers to take great risks of \nfaith to bring Christ's love to the neediest corners of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author\u0014\nDuring high school, Michael Yankoski was actively involved in his \nlocal church and youth group, with whom he went on several \ninternational mission trips, including a two-month outreach in the \nDominican Republic. Mike lives out his faith with radical intensity, \nand he is intentional in his pursuit of a lifestyle that reaches \nothers for Christ and glorifies God. Now a student at Westmont, a \nsmall Christian liberal arts college in Santa Barbara, California, he \nis studying theology and computer science.\u0014",

Complications after surgery in August led to severe infection \nthat led to organ shutdown and ultimately resulted in surgeons having \nto amputate Ess arms beneath the elbows and legs beneath her knees.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Still in intensive care, Ess, 24, faces an altogether \ndifferent-looking future than she or her family and friends \nenvisioned. Its heartbreaking, said Karen M. Videtic, chairwoman \nof Virginia Commonwealth Universitys department of fashion design \nand merchandising who was Ess adviser. Absolutely heartbreaking.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Shes quite an amazing young woman. Tall. Striking. \nBeautiful. Athlete. Shes just a really sweet, loving young lady. \nIts your worst nightmare.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Known to many as Lulu or Lu, Ess, a fashion \nmerchandising major who graduated in May, was student director of the \ndepartments annual fashion show and also worked as a teaching \nassistant in VCUs School of the Arts summer program. She also had \ndone some modeling. Shed been hired to teach fashion marketing at \nMaggie L. Walker Governors School.

We \nwere looking forward to her not having to suffer with Crohns \nanymore.\u0014\n  \u0014\n              Two days later, things were going well. Ess was up and \nabout and beginning to recuperate. But she suddenly fell ill. \nSurgeons had to go back in and repair a section of the intestine. She \nwas dagnosed with severe sepsis, a life-threatening illness typically \ncaused by the bodys response to a\u0014\n bacterial infection. The quadruple amputation was necessary because \nof lost circulation in her extremities. In the past  two months, \nshes also experienced pneumonia, congestive heart failure and  a \nseizure.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Shes a fighter, shes strong; she was physically \nfit, Aronson said.

    "words": "Ugandan pastor prays for an end to sexual violence in Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nTim Morgan\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Martin Ssempa, who I believe is one of Africa's most passionate \nchurch leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS, has been published in a \nleading Ugandan newspaper, asking what can be done about sexual \nviolence associated with HIV/AIDS.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Ssempa, who spoke at the first Saddleback HIV/AIDS conference, \nsaid:\u0014\n\u0014\n    This Christmas I am praying for the end of sexual violence in \nAfrica. Last week the High Court in South Africas Cape convicted \nGeorge Mugalula who killed his five year-old stepdaughter Aakifah \nSalie due to marital frustrations with his wife, also Aakifahs \nmother, Faiza Salie. According to court documents, Mugalula was \nangered and tortured by his wifes many affairs and secret work as a \nprostitute at Paradise Penthouse, a massage parlour in Cape Town. \nApparently he thought that his wife was working in a night painterly \nbut was shocked to discover that she was listed as one of the \nplaygirls in Paradise Penthouse. This apparently triggered off his \nviolent behaviour which in the end was directed at the vulnerable \nfive year-old who bore the brunt of his traumatised love.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some African nations, there's a persistent belief, promoted by \n'traditional healers,' that sexual relations with a virgin are a cure \nfor HIV/AIDS.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Ssempa notes:\u0014\n\u0014\n    We need the gospel to dispel the dangerously grotesque idea that \nsex with a virgin girl can cure HIV/AIDS. This prescription spread by \nAfrican traditional healers in East and Southern Africa has \nmultiplied sexual violence among virgin young girls and boys. There \nis a need to condemn this practice both by the perpetrators as well \nas the healers who perpetuate his dangerous idea.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong quite a few health care leaders, there's a professional \nreluctance to address the false traditional belief systems that have \narisen in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Traditional healers are \noften revered and feared figures in village life. The church has the \nmoral authority to take on harmful beliefs and practices without \ndemonizing the messengers.\u0014",

In this \ncontext (3:1-10, 12-13), the office of deaconess is clearly implied. \nThe likewise in verse 11 ties the qualifications of these women to \nthose already given for the offices of overseer and deacon. In verse \n11, Paul did not refer to those women as deaconesses because diakonos \nhas no feminine form. During the first few centuries of the church, \nthe role of a woman servant (diakonos) was to care for fellow \nbelievers who were sick, for the poor, for strangers passing through, \nand for the imprisoned.

    "title": "UNSPEAKABLE SUFFERING IN TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S LIFE",
    "words": "Here is the story of a man who endured unspeakable suffering in his \nlife, but triumphed in the end. The man was a politician, a member of \nthe New York State Assembly. One day a telegram arrived in his office \nin Albany. It contained a single three-word sentence: \"Come home \nnow!\" Not long before, his wife had given birth to a baby girl; he \nhad gone back to work thinking all was well, but it was not.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man took the next train back to his home in New York City, \nand as he walked through the door of his house, his brother greeted \nhim with a strange lament: \"There's a curse on this house.\" Rushing \nup to the bedroom, he found that his wife, Alice, lay dying from \nunforeseen complications of childbirth. He sat and held her, and \ncould be heard pleading: \"Let her live, let her live.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSometime during the night, a family member intruded on their \nsolitude, whispering into his ear, \"If you want to see your mother \nbefore she dies, come downstairs now.\" The man left his wife and \nwalked down a flight of stairs into his mother's room, where he held \nher until she died at 3 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned immediately to his wife's bedside, where he kept vigil \nuntil she also died, at two that afternoon. As heavy grief descended \non that household, occasionally there could be heard the cry of his \ninfant daughter, who was now without a mother. The man opened his \ndaily diary and slashed a huge \"X\" across that day's page. There he \nscribbled: \"The light has gone out of my life.\" The date was February \n14, 1884: ironically, it was Valentine's Day.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, as identical rosewood caskets were brought into New \nYork's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, friends observed that this \ndoubly bereaved man was \"in a dazed, stunned state.\" They wondered if \nhe would ever recover.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe did, though. As difficult and painful as that Valentine's Day was \nfor him, he did recover. Over time, he would find healing. He would \nmarry again. Professionally, he would serve as assistant secretary of \nthe Navy, governor of New York, and president of the United States. \nHis name was Theodore Roosevelt. In his later life, he would triumph \nnot only over personal tragedy, but also over political and \nprofessional defeat. (adapted from a story told by Victor Parachin, \n\"Tending a Wounded Heart,\" in Plus magazine, December, 2002, pp. \n25-27.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is what Teddy Roosevelt wrote, after some of these experiences \n-- wise advice for all who must live for a season through the \ntumbling of temple stones:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the \nstrong man tumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them \nbetter. The credit belongs to the person who is actually in the \narena; whose face is marred by dust, sweat and blood; who strives \nvaliantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the \ngreat enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy \ncause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high \nachievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while \ndaring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and \ntimid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.

It is \ndefinitely not taught in the New Testament, and the church at large \nhas never accepted it. But many wishful-thinking people (including \nmany Christians) are uncomfortable with the idea that anyone would \nsuffer eternal torment, so there have been and probably always will \nbe universalists.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an organized religion, Universalism began in America in the 1700s, \nwith the first congregation organized in 1779. The Winchester \nPlatform of 1803 stated that man is perfectible and all men will \neventually be saved. Since their beliefs did not square with the \nBible, Universalists gained a reputation for being unorthodox. They \nbecame increasingly less comfortable under the designation of \nChristian (even though they had started out that way), and in 1942 \nthey affirmed that they welcomed all humane people, whether or not \nthey called themselves Christian. In 1961 they merged with another \nnotably liberal group, the Unitarians, forming the \nUnitarian-Universalist Association. Burdened with this cumbersome \nname, the members now refer to themselves simply as Unitarians.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Universaliststhe no hell people, as their opponents called \nthemplayed down human sinfulness and played up mans potential. But \northodox Christians saw them as taking a too-rosy view of humankind, \nignoring the reality that mankind desperately needs a Savior and is \nin danger of hell without one. The Universalists of the 1800s did \nnumber a few celebrities among their members, including showman P. T. \nBarnum and education pioneer Horace Mann.\u0014\n\u0014\n========================================\u0014\n\u0014\nHosea Ballou (17711852)\u0014\n\u0014\nYou might call him the Apostle of Universalism. Ballou, son of a \nBaptist minister, was a conventional Christian in his early life, but \nhe later began to doubt certain basic Christian beliefs, notably that \nthere is a hell. He was ordained in the Universalist Church in 1794 \nand became one of its most noted leaders. While the early \nUniversalists were orthodox Christians (excepting their belief that \nall men will finally be saved), Ballou pushed the church in a more \nliberal direction. He reasoned (and it makes sense) that if there is \nno hell to be saved from, what is the need for all the other \nimportant Christian doctrines? So he cast doubt on belief in the \nTrinity, the divinity of Christ, and (of course) the authority of the \nBible. He would have been pleased that, more than a century after his \ndeath, the Universalists merged with the extremely liberal Unitarians.\u0014",

    "title": "UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND PRAYER",
    "words": "Understanding That We Don't Understand Prayer\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Trey Lyon\u0014\nPosted: Tuesday, November 30, 2010, Ethics Daily.com\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nPrayer is images and daydreams, visions and dirt under your \nfingernails. It is conversation and laughter, wordless grief and \nbitter tears, Lyon observes. \u0014\nI genuinely long for honesty and transparency so it's only fair to \ndisclose here that which I've privately held for many years: I don't \nunderstand prayer. This isn't some blithe ministerial \nbait-and-switch. I really, really don't get it. \u0014\n\u0014\nI've genuinely tried to diagnose this problem, and it wasn't until \nrecently that my wife managed to help me realize my aversion to \nprayer stems directly from my own \"collapse narrative.\" At some \npoint, one must confront the realities of higher textual criticism \nand all its claims on Scripture. For most college and seminary \nstudents, this is the point at which one's faith is exposed for \nalleged certainty, and the rock-solid foundations crumble like a \nparlor game of stacking bricks.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the collapse I prayed fervently  violently at times. I can \nremember sitting in a courtyard around midnight as a 16-year-old \ntalking with friends as we shared our struggles. I actually thought I \nmight be able to understand how Jesus could burst a few capillaries \nin Gethsemane. I didn't feel far from it that night. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the collapse, I confess I couldn't really figure out (and for \nthat matter, I still can't) how or what to pray for. Some of this is \ntheological. If God has it all figured out, what effect can prayer \nhave? Conversely, the thought that God is swayed by petition hardly \nseems fair. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut a far more likely explanation is that I just wasn't sure what, if \nanything, was to be accomplished by it. In this case, prayer became \npurely existential. I consoled myself with a somewhat apocryphal \nremark from C.S. Lewis in the film Shadowlands: \"I pray because I \ncan't help myself. I pray because I'm helpless. I pray because the \nneed flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn't \nchange God, it changes me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was in seminary, I was asked to lead community prayers for \nchapel one day. I remember quoting that exact line and saying, \"We \npray because we are helpless  we pray because we need to get it out \nof us, whether or not God hears us, unsure if God hears us, \nultimately in spite of whether God is listening or not.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI felt awkward about it afterward, and even now regret forcing my own \npain on others. I was at the water fountain right after the service \nwhen John Claypool spoke to me. \"What you said about prayer  what \nLewis said  is right you know. Everyone offers these things up, but \nwe don't know where they're going, what they're doing  but they get \nus through  we're just reaching at Mystery.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI felt some consolation in that, but I'm not sure I've pushed past \nthat. Friends, professors and colleagues all extolled to me the \nbenefits of spiritual formation, but I dismissed it as \"un-academic.\" \nWe always push away that which we fear, which goads our inadequacies \nand puts them front and center for all the world to see. \u0014\n\u0014\nPraying in public wasn't daunting because it was an opportunity to \ngive a light sermon or, at best, a form of public poetry that \nhappened to thank God for the things already received and petition \nGod for the outcome I desired. It was selfish, unhealthy and flat-out \nwrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince that time I have struggled all the more. About a year ago I \nfound a wonderful Jesuit resource that provides a disciplined, guided \nprayer process online. I could easily rattle off endless quotes and \nimages that God has used to move me to action or inspiration, \nthoughtfulness or repentance. I could also tell you just as many \ntimes I have clicked my mouse through those pages as fast as I \npossibly could. \u0014\n\u0014\nI know that this impulse comes from something I heard many years ago. \nA campus minister spoke to our Baptist Student Union (as it was known \nback then) and described himself as \"half cynic, half mystic.\" That \nstuck with me, mostly because I felt the tension of my unyielding \nacademic side pulling over and against my mystic side, which was and \nis now all the more fascinated by the person of Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nTrying to reclaim that mystic side has been an uphill battle, but \nI've found some fellow cynics-turned-mystics along the way. Recently \nI read of the poem of George Herbert, an Anglican minister and poet \nwho managed to pen a poem devoid of punctuation or rhyme scheme \nbefore E.E. Cummings was a glint in his father's eye. \u0014\n\u0014\nApparently poets and professors speculate on the inspiration for \nHerbert's heretofore unseen \"free-form.\" I think it far more likely \nthat Herbert knew what everyone who prays knows  and what I am \ns-l-o-w-l-y learning. Prayer is images and daydreams, visions and \ndirt under your fingernails. It is conversation and laughter, \nwordless grief and bitter tears. It is strife, it is conflict, and \nyet it is peace and irrational, unspeakable calm. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is, as Herbert writes, \"something understood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTrey Lyon is associate pastor for faith development at Towne View \nBaptist Church in Kennesaw, Ga.\u0014",

    "words": "Myth Busted: U.S. Not Founded as Christian Nation \u0014\nMiguel De La Torre,   June 1, 2011   Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if we ignore the historical account and insist that the Founding \nFathers were mostly Christians, that does not mean that our present \npolitical structures and systems should be Christian, De La Torre \nwrites. \u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical mythology provides the opportunity to construct a \nhistorical genealogy that both frames the overall public discourse \nand the mystical, if not spiritual, justification for maintaining \noppressive and repressive policies. \u0014\n\u0014\nTake for example the general belief that the Founding Fathers were \nfollowers of Jesus, purposely starting a Christian nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHolding on to this \"truth\" allows those on the Religious Right to \nadvocate for public policies that are the antithesis to the \nfundamental American rhetoric of liberty and freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIgnore for the moment that most of the writings and speeches of the \nFounding Fathers point to the fact that many, if not most, were \ndeists  a philosophical ideology containing a veneer of Christian \njargon. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be difficult to define men like Washington, Franklin or \nJefferson as Christians in the present-day evangelical usage of that \nterm. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sprinkling of Christian buzzwords in their pronouncements is \ninsufficient to maintain the proposition that the Founding Fathers \nwere disciples and believers in the Jesus of the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, contrary to the overwhelming evidence, the myth is \ncreated that they were \"born-again\" Christians as the term has come \nto be known in the 20th century. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut my purpose here is not to debunk their faith based on what they \nsaid or wrote. I have no doubt that regardless of how many footnotes \nI use, or how extensive my documentation may be, those who cling to \nthe myth of a Judeo-Christian foundation for this country would \nsimply dismiss my observations as wrong. Hence, I plan to use a \ndifferent approach.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a tree is indeed known by its fruits, then their actions within \nthe political sphere should clearly point to their faith commitment \nor their lack of faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we find is that many, if not most, of the Founding Fathers \nprovided more telling proof concerning their rejection of the gospel \nmessage of Jesus Christ than its acceptance. \u0014\n\u0014\nAllow me to provide two examples. The first entails genocidal \npractices toward the original inhabitants of the land; the second \nentails the brutal and inhumane institution of slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll the Founding Fathers were engaging in policies that brought death \nto indigenous people. In fact, one of the main motives for the \nRevolutionary War  a motive seldom appearing in our history \ntextbooks  was the eradication of British policies that kept the \noriginal colonies east of the Appalachians. \u0014\nThe Revolutionary War was as much a war for the right to move \nwestward to acquire another people's land as it was for the right of \nself-determination. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur Founding Fathers advocated and encouraged the settlement of the \nso-called wilderness. That venture could only be accomplished with \nthe genocide of those who were presently living on the land. If you \nwanted land, you first had to get rid of its inhabitants.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Founding Fathers may be great men. Yet the simple truth is that \nheaven is not for those who unrepentantly profited and participated \nin the act of genocide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second fruit that reveals the nature of the Founding Fathers' \ntree was slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne simply cannot reconcile the satanic institution of slavery with \nthe Christian faith. To do so only makes a mockery of Jesus' mission. \u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of how many Bible verses are quoted by these Founding \nFathers, the repugnant practice of trading in human flesh stands as \ntestament to their rejection of the basic Gospel message. \u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, there is no one in heaven who unrepentantly profited and \nparticipated in the institution of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy am I so intent on debunking the mythology that the United States \nwas founded as a Christian nation? \u0014\n\u0014\n1. To be faithful to scholarship.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. To be faithful to the message of Jesus Christ, opposing any \nsocietal narrative that deludes the Gospel's radical call for \nliberation.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. To be faithful to the cause of justice, refusing to sweep under \nthe carpet any \"inconvenient\" past that might prove embarrassing. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. To struggle against the danger of making a fictitious history the \ndominating storyline. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if we ignore the historical account and insist that the Founding \nFathers were mostly Christians, that does not mean that our present \npolitical structures and systems should be Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are a nation that strives toward total inclusion, the exclusive \ncall for returning to some mystical past is both dangerous and \noppressive. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am a Christian by choice. For me to be faithful to my faith, I must \nfight for the rights of Hindus, Muslims, agnostics, Santros/as, \natheists, Buddhists, and yes, even those who erroneously preach the \nend of the world, to participate in and be part of the political \nstructures. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe text on which we rely to organize our political process is the \nUnited States Constitution, a flawed and non-divine document, not the \nBible. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo rely on the Bible as the basis for governance is to flirt with \ntheocracy, an anti-democratic and historically oppressive political \nsystem. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy commitment to an ecumenical inclusion of all people of faith (or \nlack thereof) is not based on me sharing their views or beliefs. \nFreedom of religion and conscience must reign supremely. \u0014\n\u0014\nAny insistence that we were founded as a Christian nation and thus \nmust return to those roots threatens our democratic ideals.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel A. De La Torre is professor of social ethics at Iliff School \nof Theology in Denver.\u0014",

    "title": "USES OF ADULTERY AND FORNICATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT",
    "words": "USUE OF \"ADULTERY\" AND \"FORNICATION\" IN THE NEW TESTAMENT\u0014\n\u0014\nMy purpose in doing this was to clear up the fact that many \nexpositors maintain that fornication (porneia=pornography) is a \nsexual act by/with someone BEFORE marriage, and adultery (moicheia) \nis by/with someone who is married having sex with another married \nperson. That is generally true but not always, as you can see below. \nThe terms are used very loosely. My point is that you cannot say that \nfornication (porneia) always applies to only unwed people and \nadultery (moicheia) applies to married people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis ethic basically came from the Old Testament, and there is \nanother whole other mentality back of that. My paper on Theology and \nSexuality spells out that position very clearly. Unfortunately, as \nit is with our Christian ethics, they knew better than the way they \nbehaved, they just didn't do better in many cases. Samuel, Israel's \nspiritual leader, visited prostitutes as did many of his cohorts. The \nHebrews even set up prostitution sites for both men and women. Some \nrulers took them down; others put them back up. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no formal instruction in the NT forbidding unmarried people \nfrom having sexual relations with other unmarried people. It is more \nby innuendo. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCOMPARISON OF 'ADULTERY AND 'FORNICATION IN SCRIPTURE\u0014\n\u0014\nAdultery:  Moichos (adulterer or adulteress)  notes one who has \nunlawful intercourse with the spouse of another.\u0014\nLuke 18: 11\u0014\nI Cor. 6~9\u0014\nHeb. 13:4\u0014\nJas. 4:4  in KJV incorrectly translates unfaithful creatures as \nadulterers, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdultery (noun)  moicheia is found in:\u0014\nMark 7:21\u0014\nMatt. 15:19\u0014\n\u0014\nmakes  adulteress\"  moichao\u0014\nMatt. 5:32\u0014\nMatt. 19:9\u0014\n\u0014\ncommit adultery  moicheuo\u0014\nMatt.5:27,28,32\u0014\nMatt.19:18\u0014\nMark 10:19\u0014\nLuke 16:18\u0014\nLuke 18:20\u0014\nJohn 8:4\u0014\nRom. 2:22\u0014\nRom. 13:9\u0014\nJames 2:11\u0014\nRev.2:22 (metaphorical)\u0014\n\u0014\nFORNICATION  porneia  of every kind of unlawful sexual \nintercourse.\u0014\n'prostitution, unchastity, any illicit sex (used below). Note:  For \nmany interpreters, it has been the view that porneia had a different \nmeaning in first century Judaism, when it referred mainly to \n'fornication' (interpreted as sexual sin before marriage). This \nwell-established theory was popularized a few decades ago by the \nCatholic scholar Murphy O'Connor, who found supporting evidence in \nthe Dead Sea Scrolls. Since O'Connor put forward this theory, \nhowever, other scrolls have been studied (especially the Temple \nScroll) and most scholars have concluded that the early \ninterpretations of this passage were mistaken, and that it was \nactually forbidding polygamy. Porneia is not just used for sexual \nsin before marriage as can be seen in the references cited below. It \nis used interchangeably to refer to both adultery and illicit sex \nbehavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMATT. 5:32 (REFERRING TO UNFAITHFULNESS OF A MARRIED WOMAN)\u0014\nMatt. 19.9 (To a MARRIED woman)\u0014\nJohn 8:41\u0014\nActs 15: 20,29\u0014\nActs 21.25\u0014\n1 Cor. 5:1\u0014\n1 Cor. 6:13,18\u0014\n2 Cor. 12:21\u0014\nGal. 5:19\u0014\nEph. 5:3\u0014\nCol. 3:5\u0014\nI These. 4:3\u0014\nRev. 2:21)  metaphorical\u0014\nRev. 9:21)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nby FRS\u0014",

Little is known about him \nexcept that he was a Jewish doctor who lived in postrevolutionary \nRussia. He was taken prisoner and placed in a concentration camp \nwhere he continued to  practice his medical profession. Someonewho, \nwe dont know; theyre a prisoner of obscuritybut someone shared the \ngospel of Christ with him somewhere along the way, and the good \ndoctor became a believer.\u0014\n \u0014\n\tOne day he was given charge of another prisoner who was very ill. As \nthat prisoner lay in the hospital, slowly coming out from under the \nanesthesia, Boris spent the night telling him how he had found the \nMessiah and had become a Christian. For this, the record shows, Dr. \nKornfeld lost his life before the light of day, but his words never \nleft the patients mind. This particular patient was an especially \nbrilliant man, an exceptional writer whos honest and caustic pen got \nhim placed there in the Russian Gulag, where he was most often highly \nsedated and kept in the psycho ward, along with many others of his \nskills.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFeeling alone with a great spiritual void, that prisoner patient \ngave his heart to Christ and lived to write about it.

    "words": "David Branon tells about the time he and his family were savoring \nthe last few minutes of their vacation at a campground: \"The usual \nmode of transportation at the park is a golf cart, and we were taking \nout last swing around the lake before going back to the trailer and \nheading home.  But we didn't make it. About halfway around the lake \nour battery-powered cart stopped dead in its tracks.  It had run out \nof energy.  It was a long push back.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"A golf cart has no power of its own.  Every ounce of energy our \ncart used to haul us around came from an outside source. Each night \nwe plugged the buggy in to an electrical outlet that juiced it up for \nthe next day.  The problem on our last excursion was that we had \ndriven too far.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"We do the same thing in our spiritual life all the time.  We \nforget that our power is 'of God and not of us', and that we need out \nspiritual batteries recharged every day.  Instead, we keep going on \nour own until we run out of energy and nothing is left with which to \nserve the Lord.\u0014",
