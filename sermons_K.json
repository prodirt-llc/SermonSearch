    "words": "Keep Your Fork: \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and \nhad been given three months to live. As she was getting things in \norder, she contacted her pastor for him to come to her house to \ndiscuss certain aspects of her final wishes. She told him which songs \nshe wanted sung at the service, what scriptures she would like read, \nand what outfit she wanted to be buried in. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman also requested to be buried with her favorite Bible. \nEverything was done and the pastor was leaving when the woman \nsuddenly exclaimed, Theres one more thing, The pastor asked, \nWhats that? As he turned, he saw that she had left the living room \nand was in the kitchen. He heard her rummaging around as she called, \nThis is... she came back in to the living room,...very important. \nwith a fork in her right hand!\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to be buried with a fork in my right hand. she proclaimed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the pastor could say was a slow, Well...\u0014\n\u0014\nThat surprises you, doesnt it? the woman asked, smiling.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it show? the pastor asked\u0014\n\u0014\nShe nodded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor said, Well, it does seem strange.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman explained. In all my years of attending church social and \npotluck dinners, I always remember when the dishes of the main course \nwere being cleared, someone would inevitably lean over and say, Keep \nyour fork. It was my favorite part because I knew that something \nbetter was coining...like velvety chocolate cake or deep dish apple \npie. Something wonderful, and with substance! The lady said, I just \nwant people to see me there in that casket with a fork in my hand and \nI want them to wonder, Whats with the fork? Then I want you to \ntell them, Keep your fork...The best is yet to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastors eyes welled up with tears of joy as he hugged her \ngood-bye. He knew this would be one of the last times he would see \nher before her death. But he also knew that the woman had a better \ngrasp of heaven than he did. She KNEW that something better was \ncoming. At the funeral people were walking by the womans casket and \nthey saw the pretty dress she was wearing and her favorite Bible and \nthe fork placed in her right hand. Over and over, the pastor heard \nthe question, Whats with the fork? And he just smiled. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his message, he told the people of the conversation he had \nwith the woman shortly before she died and what the fork symbolized \nto her. The pastor told the people how he could not stop thinking \nabout the fork and told them that they probably would not be able to \nstop thinking about it either. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo the next time you reach down for your fork, let it gently remind \nyou that the best is yet to come...\u0014",

It thus \noriginated within the context of the Black Freedom Movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nKarenga established Kwanzaa to reinforce African culture, communal \nbonds and \"seven communitarian African values\" known as the Nguzo \nSaba or Seven Principles. The principles are:\u0014\n\u0014\n1)  Unity\u0014\n2)  Self-determination\u0014\n3)  Collective work and responsibility\u0014\n4)  Cooperative economics\u0014\n5)  Purpose\u0014\n6)  Creativity\u0014\n7)  Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nKwanzaa also uses seven basic symbols:\u0014\n\u0014\n1)  Crops, which represent harvest celebrations and rewards of labor\u0014\n2)  A mat, which represents tradition and therefore a foundation\u0014\n3)  A candle holder, which represents ancestors\u0014\n4)  Seven candles, which represent the Nguzo Saba\u0014\n5)  Corn, which represents children and the future\u0014\n6)  A cup, which represents unity\u0014\n7)  Gifts, which represent the bonds between parents and children\u0014\n\u0014\nKwanzaa is not an alternative to Christmas. It is \"a cultural choice \nas distinct from a religious one,\" according to the site.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas is both a \"religious holiday for Christians\" and a \n\"cultural holiday for Europeans.\" Karenga emphasizes the possibility \nthat one may accept the religious nature of Christmas and reject its \ncultural baggage (e.g. Santa Claus, reindeer, etc.), according to the \nsite.\u0014\n\u0014\nKwanzaa constitutes a cultural, but not religious, holiday. \nNevertheless, its African heritage imbues it with a concern for \nspirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a real and important difference between spirituality as a \ngeneral appreciation for and commitment to the transcendent, and \nreligion which suggests formal structures and doctrines,\" reads the \nsite.\u0014\n\u0014\nKwanzaas \"profound and pervasive concern with values\" has resulted \nin grave efforts to resist commercialization.\u0014\n\u0014\nFaith, one of the Seven Principles, \"stresses the spiritual and \nethical resistance to market values which undermine and distort the \nsacred and significant,\" Karenga says on the site.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe official site emphasizes how, and why, Kwanzaa celebrants work to \npreserve the holidays values in the face of corporate efforts to \nmarket the seven-day celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Any particular message that is good for a particular people, if it \nis human in its content and ethical in its grounding, speaks not just \nto that people,\" says Karenga on the site. \"It speaks to the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n*Cliff Vaughn is BCEs project coordinator.*\u0014\n\u0014\n:-) To learn more about Kwanzaas history, symbols and celebration, \nvisit Kwanzaas official Web site at \nhttp://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org\u0014",

It took two years to \nget things rolling in her town of Warner Robins, Georgia, but after \ntwo summers she and 130 child volunteers had served 3,600 meals. \"I \nhad been wondering what happens to the children during the summer \nwhen the free-lunch program ends at the close of the school yearwhat \ndid they eat?\" says Sagen, now 12. \"If they couldn't afford lunch for \nnine months of the year, what did they do for the other three months?\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      These were heavy questions for an 8-year-old to \nask, her parents thought. But Sagen wasn't just asking questions; she \nwanted solutions. When Sagen decided the community needed a summer \nfeeding program for children, her parents said, \"Great; now you need \nto find a way to do it,\" recalls her mother, Pam Woolery.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"We gave her some guidance and pointed her in \nthe direction of where to look for support in Warner Robins, but we \nstressed that it was her responsibility to make it\u0014\nwork.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                                       Gentle Army mess sergeant\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Sagen's parents suggested she go to Sam \nGuimond, a member of the family's church, Sacred Heart Catholic. The \nelderly Guimond, who oversaw a soup kitchen for\u0014\nmany years, was polite but didn't take the child seriously. \"I kept \nasking him so many questions that he eventually started ignoring me \nat church, but I just kept after him for a year,\" Sagen says with a \nshy smile.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Eventually Guimond saw her level of commitment \nand began to mentor her, teaching her how to organize a feeding \nkitchen and planting ideas about how to bring her vision\u0014\nto reality.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      What her parents thought would be a short-term \npreoccupation soon became a burning passion. Before long, \nthird-grader Sagen was on the Warner Robins speaking circuit, making \nvisits to a variety of civic groups and churches to share her passion \nfor hungry children.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Some adults politely shrugged her off. Whenever \nshe faced indifference or opposition, Guimond would prompt her with \none question: What would Jesus do? \"There were a\u0014\nlot of  people who didn't take me seriously,\" she says, \"but God took \nme seriously, and that's all that mattered.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      By the summer of 1998, Sagen had obtained the\u0014\nsupport of\u0014\n                      10 churches for the community's first \"Kids'\u0014\nKitchen\" at First\u0014\n                      United Methodist Church. With Guimond in the\u0014\nbackground,\u0014\n                      Sagen, then a fourth-grader, supervised the\u0014\nministry like a\u0014\n                      gentle Army mess sergeantpolite but always in\u0014\ncharge.\u0014\n                      Only child volunteers would do the work, she\u0014\ndecided. Adults\u0014\n                      could keep their eyes on the clocks to ensure \nthe\u0014\nwork\u0014\n                      progressed on time, but they were not allowed to\u0014\nlift a fork or\u0014\n                      wash a plate.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Concerned with safety, Sagen prohibited using\u0014\nsharp objects\u0014\n                      such as knives in food preparation, and she\u0014\navoided using\u0014\n                      stoves or micro wave ovens. She set up an \nassembly\u0014\nline of\u0014\n                      peers to assemble sack lunches with food donated\u0014\nor\u0014\n                      purchased through cash gifts. Others placed bags\u0014\nof chips, a\u0014\n                      few cookies, fruits, and soft drinks in the \npaper\u0014\nsacks.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Sagen refined the process as the first summer\u0014\ncontinued,\u0014\n                      setting up a database of 35 children, ages 8\u0014\nthrough 12, who\u0014\n                      would volunteer for specific days. The Wednes \nday\u0014\nfeeding\u0014\n                      might happen only four times a month, but\u0014\nchoreographing\u0014\n                      the schedule took hours. At times she was \noverrun\u0014\nwith\u0014\n                      volunteers, with as many as 18 peers showing up\u0014\nwhen she\u0014\n                      needed only 10.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The team served 600 lunches on a typical\u0014\nWednesday, and\u0014\n                      recipients could take leftovers home to share \nwith\u0014\ntheir\u0014\n                      families at dinner.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Won't hear no\u0014\n                      Taking her faith seriously is nothing new to the\u0014\nsoft-spoken\u0014\n                      seventh-grader at Bonaire Middle School. It's\u0014\nsomething she\u0014\n                      does, she says, because the Bible says to do it.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"The Scripture which is read frequently [in\u0014\nchurch] focuses on\u0014\n                      how God calls people into his service,\" Sagen\u0014\nsays. \"I began\u0014\n                      to focus in on those verses and began to sense\u0014\nthat God was\u0014\n                      wanting me to do this for him.

    "title": "KALEIDOSCOPIC LEADERSHIP",
    "words": "Kaleidoscopic \nLeadership\u0014\n\u0014\n[ka-lei-do-scope: Gr. kalos, beautiful + eidos, form-anything that \nconstantly changes as In color and pattern.] Are you constantly \ncreating a place of discovery and belonging?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Ron Martoia\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago I remember reading for the first time what's now a \nwell-known definition of leadership by Max DePree, \"The first \nresponsibility of a leader is to define reality.\" I was soon asking \nmyself what proved to be painfully hard questions: \"As a leader, what \nkind of reality do I help define? What about for our lead team? our \nboard? our core of unpaid servants?\" These were painful questions \nbecause the discovery didn't provoke much celebration, and they're \nhard questions because defining, creating, and architecting reality \nis no easy task.\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially I had a soaring confidence about this issue. My '905 \n\"conference junkie\" mind- set convinced me there must be some \nprogram, clergy update tape club, or defining moment I needed to have \nto get this figured out. Over time, however, I concluded I had no \nidea how to do this or what my desired outcome would be.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the ensuing years, I've come to a major ah-ha. While the point \nleader is usually the primary creative communicator, the team \ncatalyst, and even possibly the chief brain-juice hydrant, we must be \nmuch, much more. We must be ambience architects, sculptors of \norganizational culture, gardeners of organic life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs leaders we must germinate and catalyze the dance of colorful \npieces in the kaleidoscope we call church ethos. Ethos is the \ntangible yet invisible \"space-feel\" that you immediately experience \nevery time you walk into a church. Ethos is what's found to be \ncompelling and inviting or cool and repelling to those who walk \nthrough the doorway. What space-feel are we designing? What kind of \nenvironment are we creating where the dance of others' gifts, God's \nSpirit, the mess of new birth, and the depth of encountering God can \nall come together in a kaleidoscope of color?\u0014\n\u0014\nOur postmodern world is screaming for a real-life experience of \ntransformation, an encounter with the divine, and something to \nsatiate its ferocious appetite for community. We live in a new day. \nWe all sense it. We read about it and we even conference on it. But \nthe question remains: Will we as church leaders spawn life within the \norganismic ethos of church-life\u0014\nso compelling that people simply can't stay away?\u0014\nTo use Eugene Peterson's translation from The Message, will we \npresent to the lost among us a \"more and better life than they ever \ndreamed or' (John 10: 10) ?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I began wrestling with these issues, I realized I was ill-prepared \nand untrained to ride this transitional cusp of history. There were \ncertain dispositions, certain mirrors in my personal kaleidoscope \nthat needed to be present and rightly placed if I was going to lead \nour teams into a healthy ethos. Being a bit slow on the uptake at \ntimes, this stands as one of the most critical insights for me about \nleadership and its connection to ethos. The condition, vitality, \nhealth, and movement in a local church can't be understood apart from \nthe condition, vitality, health, and movement of its leaders. Are \nthere exceptions?\u0014\nSure. But this fundamental and profound truth still remains. In my \nlife and in the life of all leaders, their spiritual dynamic, clarity \nof vision, and level of expectancy usually play out in a near \none-to-one correspondence in the teams we serve and then into the \nlarger group of the church as a whole. Interestingly, over the last \nsix to eight years this insight has risen to the fore- front of \nsecular literature on leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a traditional kaleidoscope, three small mirrors provide the \nsurface where small pieces of different colored glass or plastic \ndance. Three mirrors also need to be present in our leadership life \nif we hope to provide an ethos where the compelling dance of color \ncan occur.\u0014\n\u0014\nMIRROR #1: INTERIOR SPACE LEADERSHIP\u0014\nThe exterior space around us is directly contoured and shaped by the \ncondition of our interior space. When we think of leading, rarely \ndoes personal self-leadership come flooding into our minds. We almost \nalways think about leading people who we consider subordinates or \nfollowers. Dee Hock, founder\u0014\nof Visa International, stated in \"The Art of Chaotic Leadership\" \n(Leader to Leader) that as key leaders we should be spending no less \nthan 50 percent of our time on personal self-leadership issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't need to look very far in my history to note that when my \nlocal church-Westwinds-struggled, it was often because I was \nstruggling. When I was\u0014\ngoing through some growing up on the inside, Westwinds was directly \naffected. When I experienced a quantum surge and God grew me, most \noften our teams as a whole felt it. This simple truth rocked my \nworld: What happens in us as leaders will eventually contour and \nanimate what happens around us.\u0014\nWhat's going on inside us will ultimately leak out to those around \nus. This is why you and I can't be shy about focusing on the interior \nspace mirror.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of things are interior space leadership issues? In an \narticle that was the most requested Harvard Business Review article \nin 1999, Daniel Goleman says that as important as technical job \nknow-how and IQ are in a leader's performance, what he calls \nemotional intelligence is more than two times more important in \nleaders at all levels of an organization. He says its importance \nincreases as a leader's responsibilities rise. Emotional intelligence \nis interior space leadership stuff.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelf-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social \nskill-this is the stuff of deep maturity and character development. \nHow much have you wrestled with these issues in your own personal \nleadership development? How much time have you spent exploring, \ndeveloping, and honing these kinds of emotional intelligence skills?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd this is just the beginning. What about learning to build on \nislands of health and strength-a rather counterintuitive approach, \nbut one that all great leaders are aware of? What about really being \nmentored in terms of gift development-and what that means to your \ninternal self-perceptions about how God's made you and who he wants \nyou to become?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis personal mirror will help shape a church ethos of life \ndevelopment and health hunger. Few things are more compelling than \nwatching authentic growth and maturity evolve in others. Every time I \nsee someone go deeper; deal with some emotional growing up, or take a \ncharacter issue to the next level, I get inspired. When a group of \nleaders get the mirror of interior space leadership in place, \npowerful stuff slowly leaks into the ethos of the church. People will \u0014\nobserve imperfect but growing leader and will long for the same in \ntheir lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen was the last time you thought about picking up a piece on \nbio-technology or the mapping of the genome project and probing \nwhat's going on in the area of cloning and genetic engineering? These \ntopics will have significant implications for cultural penetration \nand how the gospel may impact decision making.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Have you ever thought about how colors impact people's life and \nenvironment? What about smells?\u0014\n\u0014\nA relentless curiosity about random areas outside our frame is one of \nthe things that allow great leaders to make creative connections \namong things that previously might not have been connected. A mentor \nchallenged this in my life several years ago, and now it's a bench \nmark of my life.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Curiosity about our culture\u0014\n.How does postmodern culture impact our ministry paradigms and \nassumptions right now?\u0014\n.How are we going to understand and engage the arena of ideas in such \na way that we have hearing as a Christian church?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen this second mirror of relentless curiosity takes its place in \nthe life of leaders, a couple of things slowly leak into the ethos of \nthe church. People come to expect that new, creative, and fresh ways \nof doing things will be sought and expected. The ethos of the church \nbecomes one of permission- giving innovation. Ideas from the margins \nare seen as not only acceptable but greatly desired and appreciated. \nCuriosity yielding lifelong learning in leaders essentially creates \nan innovative ethos, a culture where \"the new thing\" (Isaiah 43: 19) \nGod may want to do is explored and celebrated. Not only do the \nkaleidoscopic pieces dance with innovation, but resilience and \"risk \nreadiness\" also join the dance. In my con- text, this is an \nincredible blessing. From our highly unusual and artistic facility to \nthe off-the-wall ideas we try in our Encounter and Fusion weekend \nservices, our ethos is that of adaptability and excitement over the \nnew. As the spiritual and cultural tectonic plates continue to shift \nunder our feet, risk, resilience, and innovation become increasingly \nimportant. The Apostle Paul is the quintessential pragmatist and \ninnovator when he essentially said: \"I will constantly morph maverick \nmethods if that is what it takes to win a few.\" (I Corinthians \n9:19-23).\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're absolutely convinced that the best ways of reaching the lost, \ngrowing deep teenagers, assisting the broken to reach wholeness, and \nconnecting our community to a relationship with Jesus they simply \ncan't live without, have yet to be designed, sketched, and sculpted. \nThose only represent a few nuggets of rationale for ambience \narchitects who create cultures of wild permission-giving and risky \nwhat -if dream sessions. We need to sculpt space where the most \ndirect route between two points is a spiral because the outcome we're \nseeking isn't determined by the speed of travel.\u0014\n\u0014\nMIRROR #3: EXPECTATION FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus did little in Scripture that was pedestrian or mundane. That \nisn't to say that most of what he did was sensational. However, Jesus \nwas full of the unexpected, the arresting, the unanticipated. This is \nthe third mirror of kaleidoscopic leader- ship. Do we really \nsubscribe to an Ephesians 3:20 expectation, \". ..who is able to do \nimmeasurably more than all we can ask or imagine\"? Do we as leaders \ngenuinely go around with full expectation that the unexpected may \nbreak in?\u0014\n\u0014\nMy first sense that this mirror was absent from my kaleidoscopic \nrepertoire was when, in the space of two weeks, God answered with \nclarity and tremendous power a number of huge requests. I was \ndumbfounded and totally shocked. I'm ashamed to say the profound \nlesson to emerge was that my expectation level with God's activity \nwas near the zero mark. His consistent, unexpected, and outrageous \nbreaking into my life in that two-week period was an essential \nindictment of my faith level. An obvious question ensues. If my level \nof expectation was so low, was it any wonder our teams in our church \nethos-at-large would also have a low expectation level?\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some questions we should think about. .When was the last \ntime you reflected on your expectation level? How would you rate it?\u0014\n\u0014\n.When was the last time the church got extravagant with its trust and \nsaw God really do something beyond human ability?\u0014\n\u0014\n.What can you do to breed an ethos of outrageous expectation?\u0014\n\u0014\nOur pre-Christian culture is full of people disillusioned with \nself-designed deities. They're tired of the manageable, manipulable \ngods of their making. Many of them are ready for a God-sized God. The \nquestion we must ask is, is that the kind of God we're introducing \nthem to-a God of biblical proportion?\u0014\n\u0014\nKaleidoscopic leadership requires the personal mirrors of interior \nspace leadership, relentless curiosity, and an expectation for the \noutrageous. When these personal mirrors are in place, they slowly \nyield a church ethos of life development, innovation and risk-taking, \nand an outrageous expectation that God can and win do anything. If \nMax DuPree is right -that the first responsibility of a leader is to \ndefine reality-I can think of few realities we'd rather see dance in \nthe kaleidoscope. \u0014\n\u0014\nRon Martoia is the transformational architect at Westwinds Community \nChurch in Jackson, Michigan.\u0014",

They do not totally \nsupport the argument being made.) \u0014\n                      In the military, \"intelligence\" denotes \ninformation about the enemy. Do you have enough \"intelligence\" on \nyour adversary to march confidently into spiritual warfare? \u0014\n\u0014\nAnswer either true or false to these statements about Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         1.Satan is a myth devised to explain evil. \u0014\n                         2.The devil has a tail, horns, and a \npitchfork. \u0014\n                         3.Satan knows Scripture and fears God. \u0014\n                         4.Satan can't tempt you once you become a \nChristian. \u0014\n                         5.The devil is a wicked counterpart to God \nwith unlimited power to do evil. \u0014\n                         6.Satan's name means \"father of lies.\" \u0014\n                         7.The devil was once an angel. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAnswers to Build Your Bible Power\u0014\n                      1. False. Satan has been active since creation \n(Gen. 3:1) and was an adversary of God's people in the Old Testament \n(1 Chron. 21:1). Jesus confirms in John 8:44 that Satan was an actual \nbeing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. False. Satan takes several forms, but this \none is never mentioned in the Bible. He appeared as a serpent in the \nGarden of Eden (Gen 3:1), and sometimes masquerades as an angel of \nlight (2 Cor. 11:14). But the form he uses most effectively is to \nremain invisible (Eph. 6:12). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      3. True. Satan quoted God's word when he \ndeceived Eve (Gen. 3:1) and he quoted Psalm 91 when he tried to tempt \nJesus in the wilderness (Matt. 4:6). Whenever Jesus confronted \ndemons, they were afraid of him (Luke 8:27-33), and James 2:19 says, \n\"You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe \nthatand shudder.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      4. False. If the Son of God was tempted by \nSatan (Matt. 4:1-11), Christians can expect to be tempted as well. \nJesus warned Peter that \"Satan has asked to sift you as wheat\" (Luke \n22:31, 32). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      5. False. God is eternal; Satan will ultimately \nbe destroyed (Rev. 20:10). God is omnipotent; what the devil's power \ncan do is limited by God (Job 1:12). God is\u0014\nomnipresent; the devil can be only in one location at a time (Job \n1:7). God is omniscient;\u0014\nthe devil prompted Judas to betray Jesus (John 13:2) and unwittingly \nhelped to fulfill God's\u0014\nplan at Calvary. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      6. False. Although Jesus calls him \"a liar and \nthe father of lies\" (John 8:44), satan is a Hebrew word meaning \n\"accuser\" or \"adversary.\" The Hebrew root word means \"to lurk for, \npersecute, hate, or oppose.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      7.

    "title": "KARL MARX, ARCHITECT OF COMMUNISM",
    "words": "Karl Marx, the son of Hirschel and Henrietta Marx, was \nborn in Trier, Germany, in 1818.\u0014\n             Hirschel Marx was a lawyer and to escape anti-Semitism \ndecided to abandon his Jewish\u0014\n             faith when Karl was a child. Although the majority of \npeople living in Trier were Catholics,\u0014\n             Marx decided to become a Protestant. He also changed his \nname from Hirschel to\u0014\n             Heinrich. \u0014\n\u0014\n             After schooling in Trier (1830-35), Marx entered Bonn \nUniversity to study law. At university\u0014\n             he spent much of his time socialising and running up \nlarge debts. His father was horrified\u0014\n             when he discovered that Karl had been wounded in a duel. \nHeinrich Marx agreed to pay\u0014\n             off his son's debts but insisted that he moved to the \nmore sedate Berlin University. \u0014\n\u0014\n             The move to Berlin resulted in a change in Marx and for \nthe next few years he worked hard\u0014\n             at his studies. Marx came under the influence of one of \nhis lecturers, Bruno Bauer, whose\u0014\n             atheism and radical political opinions got him into \ntrouble with the authorities. Bauer\u0014\n             introduced Marx to the writings of G. W. F. Hegel, who \nhad been the professor of\u0014\n             philosophy at Berlin until his death in 1831. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx was especially impressed by Hegel's theory that a \nthing or thought could not be\u0014\n             separated from its opposite. For example, the slave \ncould not exist without the master, and\u0014\n             vice versa. Hegel argued that unity would eventually be \nachieved by the equalising of all\u0014\n             opposites, by means of the dialectic (logical \nprogression) of thesis, antithesis and\u0014\n             synthesis. This was Hegel's theory of the evolving \nprocess of history. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Heinrich Marx died in 1838. Marx now had to earn his own \nliving and he decided to\u0014\n             become a university lecturer. After completing his \ndoctoral thesis at the University of Jena,\u0014\n             Marx hoped that his mentor, Bruno Bauer, would help find \nhim a teaching post. However,\u0014\n             in 1842 Bauer was dismissed as a result of his outspoken \natheism and was unable to help.\u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx now tried journalism but his radical political \nviews meant that most editors were\u0014\n             unwilling to publish his articles. He moved to Cologne \nwhere the city's liberal opposition\u0014\n             movement was fairly strong. Known as the Cologne Circle, \nthis liberal group had its own\u0014\n             newspaper, The Rhenish Gazette. The newspaper published \nan article by Marx where he\u0014\n             defended the freedom of the press. The group was \nimpressed by the article and in October,\u0014\n             1842, Marx was appointed editor of the newspaper. \u0014\n\u0014\n             In Cologne Karl Marx met Moses Hess, a radical who \ncalled himself a socialist. Marx\u0014\n             began attending socialist meetings organised by Hess. \nMembers of the group told Marx of\u0014\n             the sufferings being endured by the German working-class \nand explained how they believed\u0014\n             that only socialism could bring this to an end. Based on \nwhat he heard at these meetings,\u0014\n             Marx decided to write an article on the poverty of the \nMosel wine-farmers. The article was\u0014\n             also critical of the government and soon after it was \npublished in the Rhenish Gazette in\u0014\n             January 1843, the newspaper was banned by the Prussian \nauthorities. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Warned that he might be arrested Marx quickly married \nhis girlfriend, Jenny von\u0014\n             Westphalen, and moved to Paris where he was offered the \npost of editor of a new political\u0014\n             journal, Franco-German Annals. Among the contributors to \nthe journal was his old mentor,\u0014\n             Bruno Bauer, the Russian anarchist, Michael Bakunin and \nthe radical son of a wealthy\u0014\n             German industrialist, Friedrich Engels. \u0014\n\u0014\n             In Paris Marx began mixing with members of the working \nclass for the first time. Marx was\u0014\n             shocked by their poverty but impressed by their sense of \ncomradeship. In an article that he\u0014\n             wrote for the Franco-German Annals, Marx applied \nHengel's dialectic theory to what he had\u0014\n             observed in Paris. Marx, who now described himself as a \ncommunist, argued that the\u0014\n             working class (the proletariat), would eventually be the \nemancipators of society. When\u0014\n             published in February 1844, the journal was immediately \nbanned in Germany. Marx also\u0014\n             upset the owner of the journal, Arnold Ruge, who \nobjected to his editor's attack on\u0014\n             capitalism. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx had now become a close friend of Friedrich Engels, \nwho had just finished writing a\u0014\n             book about the lives of the industrial workers in \nEngland. Engels shared Marx's views on\u0014\n             capitalism and after their first meeting Engels wrote \nthat there was virtually \"complete\u0014\n             agreement in all theoretical fields\". Marx and Engels \ndecided to work together. It was a\u0014\n             good partnership, whereas Marx was at his best when \ndealing with difficult abstract\u0014\n             concepts, Engels had the ability to write for a mass \naudience. \u0014\n\u0014\n             While working on their first article together, The Holy \nFamily, the Prussian authorities put\u0014\n             pressure on the French government to expel Marx from the \ncountry. On 25th January 1845,\u0014\n             Marx received an order deporting him from France. Marx \nand Engels decided to move to\u0014\n             Belgium, a country that permitted greater freedom of \nexpression than any other European\u0014\n             state. Marx went to live in Brussels, where there was a \nsizable community of political\u0014\n             exiles, including the man who converted him to \nsocialism, Moses Hess. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Friedrich Engels helped to financially support Marx and \nhis family. Engels gave Marx the\u0014\n             royalties of his recently published book, Condition of \nthe Working Class in England and\u0014\n             arranged for other sympathizers to make donations. This \nenabled Marx the time to study\u0014\n             and develop his economic and political theories. Marx \nspent his time trying to understand\u0014\n             the workings of capitalist society, the factors \ngoverning the process of history and how the\u0014\n             proletariat could help bring about a socialist \nrevolution. Unlike previous philosophers, Marx\u0014\n             was not only interested in discovering the truth. As he \nwas to write later, in the past\u0014\n             \"philosophers have only interpreted the world in various \nways; the point is, to change it\". \u0014\n\u0014\n             In July 1845 Marx and Engels visited England. They spent \nmost of the time consulting\u0014\n             books in Manchester Library. Marx also visited London \nwhere he met the Chartist leader,\u0014\n             George Julian Harney and political exiles from Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n             When Karl Marx returned to Brussels he concentrated on \nfinishing his book, The German\u0014\n             Ideology. In the book Marx developed his materialist \nconception of history, a theory of\u0014\n             history in which human activity, rather than thought, \nplays the crucial role. Marx was\u0014\n             unable to find a publisher for the book, and like much \nof his work, was not published in his\u0014\n             lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\n             In January 1846 Marx set up a Communist Correspondence \nCommittee. The plan was\u0014\n             to try and link together socialist leaders living in \ndifferent parts of Europe. Influenced by\u0014\n             Marx's ideas, socialists in England held a conference in \nLondon where they formed a new\u0014\n             organisation called the Communist League. Marx formed a \nbranch in Brussels and in\u0014\n             December 1847 attended a meeting of the Communist \nLeague' Central Committee in\u0014\n             London. At the meeting it was decided that the aims of \nthe organisation was \"the overthrow\u0014\n             of the bourgeoisie, the domination of the proletariat, \nthe abolition of the old bourgeois\u0014\n             society based on class antagonisms, and the \nestablishment of a new society without\u0014\n             classes and without private property\". \u0014\n\u0014\n             When Marx returned to Brussels had concentrated on \nwriting The Communist Manifesto.\u0014\n             Based on a first draft produced by Friedrich Engels \ncalled the Principles of Communism,\u0014\n             Marx finished the 12,000 word pamphlet in six weeks. \nUnlike most of Marx's work, it was\u0014\n             an accessible account of communist ideology. Written for \na mass audience, The\u0014\n             Communist Manifesto summarised the forthcoming \nrevolution and the nature of the\u0014\n             communist society that would be established by the \nproletariat. \u0014\n\u0014\n             The Communist Manifesto was published in February, 1848. \nThe following month, the\u0014\n             government expelled Marx from Belgium. Marx and Engels \nvisited Paris before moving to\u0014\n             Cologne where they founded a radical newspaper, New \nRhenish Gazette. The men hoped\u0014\n             to use the newspaper to encourage the revolutionary \natmosphere that they had witnessed\u0014\n             in Paris. \u0014\n\u0014\n             After examples of police brutality in Cologne, Marx \nhelped establish a Committee of\u0014\n             Public Safety to protect the people against the power of \nthe authorities. The New Rhenish\u0014\n             Gazette continued to publish reports of revolutionary \nactivity all over Europe, including the\u0014\n             Democrats seizure of power in Austria and the decision \nby the Emperor to flee the country.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx's excitement about the possibility of world \nrevolution began to subside in 1849. The\u0014\n             army had managed to help the Emperor of Austria return \nto power and attempts at\u0014\n             uprisings in Dresden, Baden and the Rhur were quickly \nput down. On 9th May, 1849, Marx\u0014\n             received news he was to be expelled from the country. \nThe last edition of the New Rhenish\u0014\n             Gazette appeared on 18th May and was printed in red. \nMarx wrote that although he was\u0014\n             being forced to leave, his ideas would continue to be \nspread until the \"emancipation of the\u0014\n             working class\". \u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx now went to Paris where he believed a socialist \nrevolution was likely to take place at\u0014\n             any time. However, within a month of arriving, the \nFrench police ordered him out of the\u0014\n             capital. Only one country remained who would take him, \nand on 15th September he sailed\u0014\n             for England. Soon after settling in London Jenny Marx \ngave birth to her fourth child. The\u0014\n             Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British \ngovernment to expel Marx but the\u0014\n             Prime Minister, John Russell, held liberal views on \nfreedom of expression and refused. \u0014\n\u0014\n             With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx \nfamily lived in extreme poverty. In\u0014\n             March 1850 they were ejected from their two-roomed flat \nin Chelsea for failing to pay the\u0014\n             rent. They found cheaper accommodation at 28 Dean \nStreet, Soho, where they stayed for\u0014\n             six years. Their fifth child, Franziska, was born at \ntheir new flat but she only lived for a\u0014\n             year. Eleanor was born in 1855 but later that year, \nEdgar became Jenny Marx's third child\u0014\n             to die. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx spent most of the time in the Reading Room of the \nBritish Museum, where he read\u0014\n             the back numbers of The Economist and other books and \njournals that would help him\u0014\n             analyze capitalist society. In order to help supply Marx \nwith an income, Friedrich Engels\u0014\n             returned to work for his father in Germany. The two kept \nin constant contact and over the\u0014\n             next twenty years they wrote to each other on average \nonce every two days. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Friedrich Engels sent postal orders or 1 or 5 notes, \ncut in half and sent in separate\u0014\n             envelopes. In this way the Marx family was able to \nsurvive. The poverty of the Marx's family\u0014\n             was confirmed by a Prussian police agent who visited the \nDean Street flat in 1852. In his\u0014\n             report he pointed out that the family had sold most of \ntheir possessions and that they did\u0014\n             not own one \"solid piece of furniture\". \u0014\n\u0014\n             Jenny helped her husband with his work and later wrote \nthat \"the memory of the days I\u0014\n             spent in his little study copying his scrawled articles \nis among the happiest of my life.\" The\u0014\n             only relief from the misery of poverty was on a Sunday \nwhen they went for family picnics on\u0014\n             Hampstead Heath. \u0014\n\u0014\n             In 1852, Charles Dana, the socialist editor of the New \nYork Daily Tribune, offered Marx\u0014\n             the opportunity to write for his newspaper. Over the \nnext ten years the newspaper\u0014\n             published 487 articles by Marx (125 of them had actually \nbeen written by Engels). Another\u0014\n             radical in the USA, George Ripley, commissioned Marx to \nwrite for the New American\u0014\n             Cyclopaedia. With the money from Marx's journalism and \nthe 120 inherited from Jenny's\u0014\n             mother, the family were able to move to 9 Grafton \nTerrace, Kentish Town. \u0014\n\u0014\n             In 1856 Jenny Marx, who was now aged 42, gave birth to a \nstill-born child. Her health took\u0014\n             a further blow when she contacted smallpox. Although she \nsurvived this serious illness, it\u0014\n             left her deaf and badly scarred. Marx's health was also \nbad and he wrote to Engels\u0014\n             claiming that \"such a lousy life is not worth living\". \nAfter a bad bout of boils in 1863 Marx\u0014\n             told Engels that the only consolation was that \"it was a \ntruly proletarian disease\". \u0014\n\u0014\n             By the 1860s the work for the New York Daily Tribune \ncame to an end and Marx's money\u0014\n             problems returned. Engels sent him 5 a month but this \nfailed to stop him getting deeply\u0014\n             into debt. Ferdinand Lassalle, a wealthy socialist from \nBerlin also began sending money\u0014\n             to Marx and offered him work as an editor of a planned \nnew radical newspaper in Germany.\u0014\n             Marx, unwilling to return to his homeland and rejected \nthe job. Lassalle continued to send\u0014\n             Marx money until he was killed in a duel on 28th August \n1864. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Despite all his problems Marx continued to work and in \n1867 the first volume of Das Kapital\u0014\n             was published. A detailed analysis of capitalism, the \nbook dealt with important concepts\u0014\n             such as surplus value (the notion that a worker receives \nonly the exchange-value, not the\u0014\n             use-value, of his labour); division of labour (where \nworkers become a \"mere appendage of\u0014\n             the machine\") and the industrial reserve army (the \ntheory that capitalism creates\u0014\n             unemployment as a means of keeping the workers in \ncheck). \u0014\n\u0014\n             In the final part of Das Kapital Marx deals with the \nissue of revolution. Marx argued that the\u0014\n             laws of capitalism will bring about its destruction. \nCapitalist competition will lead to a\u0014\n             diminishing number of monopoly capitalists, while at the \nsame time, the misery and\u0014\n             oppression of the proletariat would increase. Marx \nclaimed that as a class, the proletariat\u0014\n             will gradually become \"disciplined, united and organised \nby the very mechanism of the\u0014\n             process of capitalist production\" and eventually will \noverthrow the system that is the cause\u0014\n             of their suffering. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx now began work on the second volume of Das Kapital. \nBy 1871 his sixteen year old\u0014\n             daughter, Eleanor Marx, was helping him with his work. \nTaught at home by her father,\u0014\n             Eleanor already had a detailed understanding of the \ncapitalist system and was to play an\u0014\n             important role in the future of the British labour \nmovement. On one occasion Marx told his\u0014\n             children that \"Jenny (his eldest daughter) is most like \nme, but Tussy (Eleanor) is me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n             Marx was encouraged by the formation of the Paris \nCommune in March 1871 and the\u0014\n             abdication of Louis Napoleon. Marx called it the \n\"greatest achievement\" since the\u0014\n             revolutions of 1848, but by May the revolt had collapsed \nand about 30,000 Communards\u0014\n             were slaughtered by government troops. \u0014\n\u0014\n             This failure depressed Marx and after this date his \nenergy began to diminish. He continued\u0014\n             to work on the second volume of Das Kapital but progress \nwas slow, especially after\u0014\n             Eleanor Marx left home to become a schoolteacher in \nBrighton. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Eleanor returned to the family home in 1881 to nurse her \nparents who were both very ill.\u0014\n             Marx, who had a swollen liver, survived, but Jenny Marx \ndied on 2nd December, 1881.\u0014\n             Karl Marx was also devastated by the death of his eldest \ndaughter in January 1883 from\u0014\n             cancer of the bladder. Karl Marx died two months later \non the 14th March, 1883. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n             (1) Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist \nManifesto (1848) \u0014\n\u0014\n             Communists openly declare that their ends can be \nattained only by the forcible overthrow\u0014\n             of all existing social conditions.

    "words": "Kierkegaard's Story of the Prince\u0014\n\u0014\nWe affirm a belief in the Son, Jesus Christ. We say that God took on \nhuman\u0014\nform, came and lived among us, suffered the same trials that we \nsuffered,\u0014\nexperienced the same Feelings that we experienced. Jesus was purely \nhuman\u0014\nand purely divine. Jesus was not God. Jesus was God incarnate. There \nis a\u0014\ndifference. Jesus never drew attention to himself but always pointed \nto God.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoren Kierkegaard, the great Danish theologian of another century \ntells a\u0014\nstory of a prince who wanted to find a maiden suitable to be his \nqueen. One\u0014\nday while running an errand in the local village for his father he \npassed\u0014\nthrough a poor section. As he glanced out the windows of the carriage \nhis\u0014\neyes fell upon a beautiful peasant maiden. During the ensuing days he \noften\u0014\npassed by the young lady and soon fell in love. But he had a problem. \nHow\u0014\nwould he seek her hand?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could order her to marry him. But even a prince wants his bride to \nmarry\u0014\nhim freely and voluntarily and not through coercion. He could put on \nhis\u0014\nmost splendid uniform and drive up to her front door in a carriage \ndrawn by\u0014\nsix horses. But if he did this he would never be certain that the \nmaiden\u0014\nloved him or was simply overwhelmed with all of the splendor. As you \nmight\u0014\nhave guessed, the prince came up with another solution. He would give \nup his\u0014\nkingly robe. He moved, into the village, entering not with a crown \nbut in\u0014\nthe garb of a peasant. He lived among the people, shared their \ninterests and\u0014\nconcerns, and talked their language. In time the maiden grew to love \nhim for\u0014\nwho he was and because he had first loved her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis very simple, almost child like story, written by one of the most\u0014\nbrilliant minds of our time explains what we Christians mean by the\u0014\nincarnation. God came and lived among us. I am glad that this \nhappened for\u0014\ntwo reasons. One, it shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is \nwith us,\u0014\nthat he is on our side, and that he loves us. Secondly, it gives us a \nfirst\u0014\nhand view of what the mind of God is really all about. When people \nask what\u0014\nGod is like, we as Christians point to the person of Jesus Christ. God\u0014\nhimself is incomprehensible. But in Jesus Christ we get a glimpse of \nhis\u0014\nglory. In the person of Jesus we are told that God, that mysterious \nother\u0014\nthat created the stars and the universe, is willing to go all of the \nway, to\u0014\nbe one of us, talk our language, eat our food, share our suffering \ndie on a\u0014\ncross. Why? So that a single person, you, me, might be redeemed. And, \ngrow\u0014\nto love Him.\u0014",

    "words": "Doctors and nurses were doing everything possible for my wife, the \nmother of my seven children, yet I could see the hopelessness in \ntheir faces. Through an emergency C-section during the fifth month of \nher pregnancy, it was discovered the detached placenta had grown \nthrough the uterus and attached itself to her bladder. Bleeding was \nso profuse during surgery that Kris was given 30 units of blood. As \nthe night wore on, her battle for life became desperate.\u0014\n\u0014\n     I cried out, \"God, what do you want? I know you can heal her; \nwhy don't you?\" In the middle of my darkest night, God began to \nspeak. I wanted a miracle. He wanted to discuss his nature.\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Do you believe I am a loving God?\" the Spirit asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Sitting beside my wife's bed, amid the chaos of ICU, I needed to \nanswer that question. I could have said,  \"No, God cannot be a loving \nGod. Look around here. My wife is dying. My newborn daughter may die. \nI have to go home and tell six children that their mother will not \ncome home againever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     But that night God gave me the grace to see him as he is.\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Yes,\" I told him. \"You are a loving God. No matter what happens \nhere tonight I will not question your nature.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Kris's condition worsened.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Kris understood that all life is precious and was determined to \ngive our child all she had to help her in her struggle to live. In \nthe end, it cost Kris her life. Grace lived 16 days.\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"What about our plans, God?\" I asked. \"Who will teach the kids, \nguide them, and love them like their mother?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     God laid it on the heart of a man to head up an effort which \nbecame known as \"Help Bring Hope to the Hoyt Kids.\" In six months, \nhundreds of people worked, sent money, donated supplies and poured \nlove into our family. Churches provided food daily; on weekends, as \nmany as 50 people were fed.\u0014\n\u0014\n     I received more than 500 letters, e-mails and cards from people \nwho said they were praying for us.\u0014\n\u0014\n     I am writing this in the house God has given us. The medical \nbills are gone. The house is paid for.

I tried to remember her with the light of life \nin her eyes, but all I could see was death.

Following are \nsome of her recollections: \u0014\n\u0014\n                  -- People would say, \"How can you get along with \nMr. Wright? I hear he has a terrible\u0014\n                  temper.\" And I said he's a man who gives 103% to \n105% to everything he does. I was\u0014\n                  very much impressed with his attitude. He wants you \nto do the same, and, if you do,\u0014\n                  you won't have any problem. In 1942, he wanted me \nto keep the job title \"secretary\"\u0014\n                  rather than be called \"business manager\" because he \nfelt it was more ladylike. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  -- All kinds of people showed up for Whirlaway Day \non Aug. 8, 1943. They were thrilled\u0014\n                  to see him. We had to call the county patrol to \nhandle the crowd. I've always said he\u0014\n                  put us on the map by winning the Derby. That was \nthe beginning of our long streak of\u0014\n                  winning the prestigious races. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  -- John Veitch, the last of our trainers, is a \nwonderful fellow. We all got along so well,\u0014\n                  and he was so nice to Mrs. Markey. He should have \nbeen an ambassador to Russia,\u0014\n                  because the Admiral would call him up and tell him \nwhat to do and not do when it\u0014\n                  came to running a horse. But the two were always \nclose. John had a way with him\u0014\n                  that was second to none. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  -- The Admiral was good for Mrs. Markey, and they \nloved to travel. Once when they\u0014\n                  were in England, he called me up and said, \n\"Mawgrit\" (he always called me that,\u0014\n                  Southern gentleman talk), \"we're in London, \nEngland, and want to play Scrabble, and\u0014\n                  they don't have that game. Would you send us one?\" \nI did, that same afternoon. No\u0014\n                  matter what they wanted, they would call me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  -- I started out having a party for the department \nheads at the farm in the 1960s.

I couldn't stand\u0014\n                  leaving the other farm workers off the list, so \nafter that, we invited all of the \"Calumet\u0014\n                  family\" of workers.

    "title": "KOINONIA FARM GROWS DISCIPLES",
    "words": "Koinonia Farm Grows Disciples\u0014\nBY Doug Weaver \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Baptists concerned with social justice have heard of Clarence \nJordan and Koinonia Farm. Powerful anecdotes abound about the author \nof the Cotton Patch Gospels. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn one occasion, Jordan spoke to a Southern congregation about \nracism, and an elderly woman retorted, \"I want you to know that my \ngrandfather fought in the Civil War, and I'll never believe a word \nyou say.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ma'am, your choice seems quite clear,\" Jordan replied. \"It is \nwhether you will follow your granddaddy or Jesus Christ.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis clear call to discipleship led Clarence and Florence Jordan and \nMabel and Martin England to form a Christian commune in 1942, eight \nmiles from Americus, Ga. \u0014\n\u0014\nClarence Jordan, a native Georgian, held a doctorate from Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary and had served as an inner-city \nmissionary (with Henlee Barnette) in Louisville, Ky. The Englands had \nserved a term as American Baptist missionaries in Burma.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name and spirit of Koinonia Farm were drawn from Acts 2:44-45 and \n4:32-35. Members of the Christian community combined their resources \nand shared all things. Core principles included pacifism/nonviolence, \nracial reconciliation and simple living, all derived from the \nteachings of Jesus. \u0014\nThey intended to be a \"demonstration plot\" of the Kingdom of God. \nKingdom outreach meant teaching advanced methods to local farmers to \nhelp them defeat poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nResidents at Koinonia Farm met immediate and persistent resistance \nfrom local whites. The key issue was race. Members of the Ku Klux \nKlan warned Jordan and England about racial interaction at the farm.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1950, Rehobeth Baptist Church, located nearby, excommunicated \nKoinonia residents from the church because of racial openness at the \nfarm. In 1956, after Jordan supported the rights of two blacks to \nattend public universities, Koinonia Farm and its residents were the \ntargets of violence, vandalism, tax investigations and economic \nboycotts in the local community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of people who lived at Koinonia Farm was never large. At \nits numerical peak in 1956, Koinonians totaled about 60. Twenty-five \npercent were African-Americans; about 50 percent were children. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut oppressive violence drove many away, making the Jordans and Will \nand Margaret Wittkamper (who had arrived in 1953) the only residents \nin 1968 (the Englands had returned to missionary service in Burma \nbefore World War II concluded).\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia Farm turned a corner in 1968 when Millard and Linda Fuller \narrived. In previous years, residents had farmed and then developed a \npecan/fruitcake mail-order business to survive amid local \nhostilities. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Fuller and Jordan together planned to build low-cost houses and \noffer them to the needy through 20-year, no-interest loans. A Fund \nfor Humanity was created to collect pledges, and Koinonia Farm became \nKoinonia Partners.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Jordan died later that year, the housing ministry, \n\"Partnership Housing,\" gave renewed purpose to Koinonia, and by 1979 \nthe commune had 36 adult members (resident partners). \u0014\nFrom 1969 to 1992, 194 houses were built. The legacy of the ministry \nis Habitat for Humanity International, the renowned housing ministry \nstarted by the Fullers after they left Koinonia in the mid-1970s. In \nview of Fuller's work, Koinonia shifted its emphasis to the \n\"rehabilitation\" of existing houses. \u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia sparked two other ministries. In 1979, three families left \nKoinonia to develop a ministry to refugee \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa, \nespecially those from Central America; that became Jubilee Partners, \nestablished in the north Georgia community of Comer. Then in 1989, \ntwo former Koinonia resident partners created the New Hope House in \nGriffin, Ga., to minister to prisoners and their families.\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia Farm still offers a communal lifestyle of discipleship. \nWhile the number of permanent residents is small, short- and \nlong-term volunteers are frequent guests. They form a \"working \ncommunity\" that farms, sells pecans and peanuts, renovates houses, \nand reaches out to the local area with a Child Development Center and \nadult education opportunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia residents are committed to radical discipleship and the \noriginal purposes of the Jordans and Englands: nonviolence, \nreconciliation of all peoples and empowerment of the poor. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We'll worship the hind legs off Jesus,\" Jordan warned, \"but never do \na thing he says.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver is professor of Christianity and chair of the religion \nand philosophy division at Brewton-Parker College in Mt. Vernon, Ga.\u0014",

    "title": "KEEPING YOUR CLOCK TICKING",
    "words": "Keeping Your Clock Ticking\u0014\n   by John Ortberg, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   Ministry must be done in a rhythm of engagement and\u0014\n   withdrawal. Wise followers of Christ have always understood\u0014\n   solitude to be the foundational practice. Jesus engaged in it\u0014\n   frequently. But what makes it so important? Solitude is the\u0014\n   one place where we gain freedom from the forces of society\u0014\n   that otherwise relentlessly mold us. It is (in one old phrase)\u0014\n   the \"furnace of transformation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dallas Willard noted an experiment done with mice a few years\u0014\n   ago. A researcher found that when amphetamines are given to a\u0014\n   mouse in solitude, it takes a high dosage to kill it. Give it\u0014\n   to a group of mice, and they start hopping around and hyping\u0014\n   each other up so much that a fraction of the dosage will be\u0014\n   lethal -- so great is the effect of \"the world\" on mice. In\u0014\n   fact, a mouse given no amphetamines at all, placed in a group\u0014\n   on the drug, will get so hyper that in 10 minutes or so it\u0014\n   will be dead. \"In groups,\" Willard noted, \"they go off like\u0014\n   popcorn.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   You'd think only mice would be so foolish as to hang out with\u0014\n   other mice that are so hopped up, so frantically pursuing\u0014\n   mindless activity for no discernible purpose that they put\u0014\n   their own lives at risk.\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> What exactly is solitude?\u0014\n   Some people ask, \"What do I do when I practice solitude? What\u0014\n   should I bring with me? The primary answer, of course, is\u0014\n   \"Nothing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Not long ago, a man told me about preparing for his first\u0014\n   extended period of solitude: he brought books, message tapes,\u0014\n   CDs, and a VCR. Those are the very things you go into solitude\u0014\n   to get away from.\u0014\n\u0014\n   At its heart, solitude is primarily about not doing something.\u0014\n   Just as fasting means to refrain from eating, so solitude\u0014\n   means to refrain from society. When I go into solitude, I\u0014\n   withdraw from conversation, from others, from noise, from\u0014\n   media, from the constant barrage of stimulation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"In solitude,\" Henri Nouwen wrote, \"I get rid of my\u0014\n   scaffolding.\" Scaffolding is all the stuff I use to keep\u0014\n   myself propped up, to convince myself I'm important or okay.\u0014\n   In solitude I have no friends to talk with, no phone calls or\u0014\n   meetings, no TV to entertain, no music or books or newspapers\u0014\n   to occupy and distract my mind. I am, in the words of the old\u0014\n   hymn, \"Just as I Am\": not my accomplishments or resume or\u0014\n   possessions or networks -- just me and my sinfulness, and God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Put it on the calendar\u0014\n   Solitude requires relentless perseverance. Unless I pull my\u0014\n   calendar out and write down well in advance when I am\u0014\n   committed to times of solitude, it won't happen.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   I think about solitude in two categories: I need brief periods\u0014\n   of solitude on a regular basis -- preferably each day, even at\u0014\n   intervals during the day. But I also need extended periods of\u0014\n   solitude -- a half day, a day, or a few days -- and this is\u0014\n   possible only at greater intervals. Frances de Sales, author\u0014\n   of the classic An Introduction to the Devout Life, used the\u0014\n   image of a clock:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"There is no clock, no matter how good it may be, that doesn't\u0014\n   need resetting and rewinding twice a day, once in the morning\u0014\n   and once in the evening. In addition, at least once a year it\u0014\n   must be taken apart to remove the dirt clogging it, straighten\u0014\n   out bent parts, and repair those worn out. In like manner,\u0014\n   every morning and evening a man who really takes care of his\u0014\n   heart must rewind it for God's service.... At least once a\u0014\n   year, he must take it apart and examine every piece in detail,\u0014\n   that is, every affection and passion, in order to repair\u0014\n   whatever defects there may be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Here's how I do it\u0014\n   I try to begin my days by praying over the day's schedule --\u0014\n   meetings I'll attend, tasks I must perform, people I'll be\u0014\n   with -- and placing them all in God's hands. Through the day,\u0014\n   I try to take 5-minute breaks, close the door to my office,\u0014\n   and remind myself that one day the office will be gone and\u0014\n   I'll still belong to God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   At the end of the day, I like to review the day with God: to\u0014\n   go over the events to see what he might be saying to me\u0014\n   through them, and to hand any anxieties or regrets over to\u0014\n   him. One of the great benefits of this exercise is that you\u0014\n   begin to learn from your days.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   When I was in athletics in school, we used to watch videotapes\u0014\n   of our performances. They were sometimes painful to watch, but\u0014\n   it was worth it to be spared from making the same mistakes\u0014\n   over and over. It's the same here. For instance, when I began\u0014\n   this daily review, I discovered I experienced much more anger\u0014\n   than I ever thought. I began to be aware of the attitudes and\u0014\n   responses that were guiding my life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   I also need extended times alone. One of the great obstacles\u0014\n   you will likely face is that extended solitude will feel like\u0014\n   a waste of time. We're so conditioned to feel our existence is\u0014\n   justified only when we are accomplishing something. But also,\u0014\n   for me, this feeling comes because my mind wanders so much. I\u0014\n   used to think if I devoted a large chunk of time to praying, I\u0014\n   should be able to engage in solid, uninterrupted, focused\u0014\n   prayer. But I can't.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   What I have come to realize, slowly, is that bits of focused\u0014\n   prayer interspersed with these wanderings is all my mind is\u0014\n   capable of now. One day I hope to do better. But for now, I\u0014\n   have to accept that a large chunk of prayer time will be lost\u0014\n   to wandering. Brother Lawrence said it like this: \"For many\u0014\n   years I was bothered by the thought that I was a failure at\u0014\n   prayer. Then one day I realized I would always be a failure at\u0014\n   prayer; and I've gotten along much better ever since.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   John Ortberg is teaching pastor at Willow Creek Community\u0014\n   Church in South Barrington, Illinois.

His condition worsened, and he was confined there for \nquite\u0014\na few weeks. His doctor even had told him that he wasn't sure if he'd\u0014\nrecover, but that they would continue to do all they could. The man \nwas\u0014\nobviously scared to death, and said to the doctor, \"please, doctor, do\u0014\neverything you can, I don't want to die, I have so much to do yet in \nlife,\u0014\nand if you can help me get better, I'll even donate $10,000 to the \nfund for\u0014\nthe new hospital. The young man happily began to improve and \nrecovered, and\u0014\na few weeks later was released and went home.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral months later, while he was out in the town, he saw the doctor \non the\u0014\nstreet, and the doctor asked him how he felt. The young man said, \nDoc, I\u0014\nhaven't felt better any time in my life. The doctor said that's great,\u0014\nbecause I wanted to ask you about the money you said you wanted to \ndonate to\u0014\nthe new hospital fund. You remember you said if you got well, you'd \nlike to\u0014\ndonate $10,000, and we could really use that now. The young man said, \nMan,\u0014\nIf I said that, I must have been really sick.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor some people, making and KEEPING promises seems to be a really \ntough\u0014\nissue, for some reason or another.

Famously self-absorbed, he alienated the world through his \nlove of military pomp and intense competitiveness (compensation in \npart for a withered left arm). In 1890, his pompous stance in an \nofficial state painting prompted a French general to gasp, \"That's \nnot a portrait. It's a declaration of war!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKaiser Wilhelm was determined to have Germany become one of Europe's \ngreat powers, to take what he called her \"place in the sun,\" but he \nfailed to understand the weakness of the country's geographical \nposition, sandwiched between France and Russia. Tragically, his \nboasting and ambition produced some legendary political blunders.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilhelm repeatedly insulted his closest ally, the Austro-Hungarian \nEmpire. On an 1888 state visit to Vienna, for instance, he vainly \ndemanded the departure of all other visiting monarchs before his \narrival. Austria generally tolerated the Kaiser's whims, but in 1889 \ntheir Emperor Franz Josef revealed everyone's true feelings after the \nsuicide of his son. Identical telegrams were dispatched to every head \nof state, except Kaiser Wilhelm, announcing that the funeral would be \na private family affair. The Kaiser received a personal request--to \nstay away from Vienna.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1895, he infuriated Britain by congratulating South African \nTransvaal President Paul Kruger, whose troops had crushed a British \nraid. Ten years later, he stunned the French by supporting Morocco's \nindependence when France sought it as a protectorate. In 1908, he \nalienated Britain, France, and Russia all at once by insisting that \nGermany's massive naval expansion was directed at Japan, a \ntransparent lie that fooled no one and helped lead eventually to WWI. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, for years Wilhelm was blamed for deliberately leading Germany \ninto WWI. Recent historians, however, have argued that Wilhelm never \nintended or wanted such a conflict, but was simply incapable of \nunderstanding the political impact of his words and actions.\u0014",

    "title": "KHRUSHCHEV - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Reviewed by Martin J. Sherwin\u0014\n         \u0014\nKhrushchev: The Man and His Era is a big, engaging book about a \npolitical giant, and author William Taubman has skillfully painted \nhis life on a large historical canvas. Khrushchev emerges in vivid, \nengaging prose as an intriguing and commanding historical figure \nwhose life affords us an insiders view of the inner workings and \nevolution of the Soviet political system, from its founding to its \ndemise.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaubman is able to create such a sweeping history because Khrushchev \nnot only grew up both with and within the Communist Party, but he \nalso was the guiding hand in the post-Stalin reforms that set the \npolitical trajectory that the Soviet State followed even after he was \nforced from office in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nKhrushchevs life and career thus constitute a classic case of the \nintersection of personality and history. Contrary to the clownish \nimage he self-consciously created by banging his shoe on his desk to \nregister his displeasure at the United Nations, the Soviet leader who \nruled the USSR from 1953 to 1964 was, arguably, the pivotal \ninternational figure of the Cold War. He was a personality to be \nreckoned witha brash and enthusiastic bear of a man who spoke what \nwas on his mind and in the process reshaped the image of the USSR, \nrelations with the United States, and the character of international \ndiplomacy.\u0014\n         \u0014\nTaubmans biography is not only the first comprehensive study of \nKhrushchev, but it is the first of any Soviet leader to make use of \nthe full range of heretofore secret sources that have become \navailable since the USSR collapsed. The book explores so many \nimportant issues that there is little opportunity in a short review \nto do them justice. But the questions it both poses and answers are \nfundamental to any intelligent understanding of the Soviet Union, and \nthe history of the Cold War. How did a poor, ill-educated peasant \nrise into Joseph Stalins inner circle, and then not only survive but \nsucceed one of historys most vicious tyrants? How was it that a man \nwho was complicit in Stalins terrible crimes eventually unmask his \nformer master? How did Khrushchevs attempts to reform Communism pave \nthe way for its eventual transformation and collapse three decades \nlater? How did his awkward efforts to end the Cold War trigger crises \nin Berlin and Cuba which brought the world closer than it has ever \nbeen to nuclear war? And, how did Khrushchevs policies affect \nAmerican Cold War diplomacy?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo find answers to these questions, Taubman explored an astonishing \nnumber of archives in Russia, the Ukraine, Eastern Europe and the \nWest. He made numerous trips to places where Khrushchev lived and \nworked, and conducted extensive interviews with Khrushchev family \nmembers and colleagues, and with Westerners who had jousted with him. \nThe book is filled with information that provides a deeper \nunderstanding of the Soviet Union and the nature of the Cold War than \neven informed academic readers command. Weaving the dramatic events \nof Khrushchevs life into a compelling narrative, Taubman has written \nan engaging biography with literary grace and scholarly authority. \n768 pages  61/8\" x 91/4\"  photographs  maps\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: William Taubman is a professor of political science \nat Amherst College and the author of Stalins American Policy, Moscow \nSpring, and other books on the Soviet Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Reviewer:  Martin J. Sherwin, the Walter S. Dickson \nProfessor of English and American History at Tufts University is \ncompleting a biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer with co-author Kai \nBird.\u0014\n\u0014\n From Publishers Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\nAmherst College political science professor Taubman's thorough and \nnuanced account is the first full-length American biography of \nKhrushchev-and will likely be the definitive one for a long time. \nRussians, Taubman explains, are still divided by Khrushchev's legacy, \nlargely because of the great contradiction at the heart of his \ncareer: he worked closely with Stalin for nearly 20 years, approved \nthousands of arrests and executions, and continued to idolize the \ndictator until the latter's death. Yet it was Khrushchev who publicly \nrevealed the enormity of Stalin's crimes, denounced him, and \nintroduced reforms that, Taubman argues, \"allowed a nascent civil \nsociety to take shape\"-eventually making way for perestroika. Taubman \nuntangles the fascinating layers of deception and self-deception in \nKhrushchev's own memoir, weighing just how much the leader was likely \nto have known about the purges and his own culpability in them. He \nalso shows that shadows of Stalinism lingered through Khrushchev's 11 \nyears in power: his fourth-grade education left him both awed and \nthreatened by the Russian intelligentsia, which he persecuted; \nintending to de-escalate the Cold War, the mercurial, blustering \nfirst secretary ended up provoking dangerous standoffs with the U.S. \nThe bumbling, equivocal speeches quoted here make Khrushchev seem a \nrank amateur in international affairs-or, as Taubman politely puts \nit, he had trouble \"thinking things through.\" Working closely with \nKhrushchev's children, and interviewing his surviving top-level \nCentral Committee colleagues and aides, Taubman has pieced together a \nremarkably detailed chronicle, complete with riveting scenes of \nKremlin intrigue and acute psychological analysis that further \nilluminates some of the nightmarish episodes of Soviet history. 32 \npages of photos not seen by PW.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\n From Booklist\u0014\nTaubman masterfully replicates in his biography of Krushchev the \ncareer contrasts expressed by his grave marker--a bust framed half by \nblack stone, half by white. Up to his elbows in blood, Khrushchev \nwill nevertheless go down in history as the denouncer of Stalin. He \npartially denounced Stalin in the celebrated \"secret speech\" of 1956, \nand did so as a maneuver in a power struggle with inveterate \nStalinists; however, his revulsion for Stalin's rule was genuine. The \nparadox of Khrushchev's complicity in the repression and his natural \nhumanity induces Taubman to treat his life as a mirror of the entire \nSoviet experience. The author observes that the young Khrushchev \nmight have been a successful factory manager but for the revolution. \nAfter initial hesitation, he joined the Bolsheviks in 1918 and in a \ndozen years ascended to Stalin's inner circle, enforcing the boss' \nedicts in various posts. Ambition, guilt, a true belief in Communism, \nand self-doubt churned within him, and the effects of his exuberant, \ntension-filled character, on the cold war and on Soviet domestic \naffairs up to his overthrow in 1964, close out Taubman's \noutstandingly composed work, assuredly the reference point for future \nwritings on Khrushchev. Gilbert Taylor\u0014\nCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\nThe definitive biography of the mercurial Soviet leader who succeeded \nand denounced Stalin.\u0014\n\u0014\nNikita Khrushchev was one of the most complex and important political \nfigures of the twentieth century. Ruler of the Soviet Union during \nthe first decade after Stalin's death, Khrushchev left a \ncontradictory stamp on his country and on the world. His life and \ncareer mirror the Soviet experience: revolution, civil war, famine, \ncollectivization, industrialization, terror, world war, cold war, \nStalinism, post-Stalinism. Complicit in terrible Stalinist crimes, \nKhrushchev nevertheless retained his humanity: his daring attempt to \nreform communism prepared the ground for its eventual collapse; and \nhis awkward efforts to ease the cold war triggered its most dangerous \ncrises.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the first comprehensive biography of Khrushchev and the first \nof any Soviet leader to reflect the full range of sources that have \nbecome available since the USSR collapsed. Combining a page-turning \nhistorical narrative with penetrating political and psychological \nanalysis, this book brims with the life and excitement of a man whose \nstory personified his era. 32 pages of photographs, map.\u0014",

    "title": "KEEPERS OF BUSH IMAGE LIFT STAGECRAFT TO NEW HEIGHTS",
    "words": "May 16, 2003\u0014\nKeepers of Bush Image Lift Stagecraft to New Heights\u0014\nBy ELISABETH BUMILLER\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON, May 15  George W. Bush's \"Top Gun\" landing on the deck \nof the carrier Abraham Lincoln will be remembered as one of the most \naudacious moments of presidential theater in American history. But it \nwas only the latest example of how the Bush administration, going far \nbeyond the foundations in stagecraft set by the Reagan White House, \nis using the powers of television and technology to promote a \npresidency like never before.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials of past Democratic and Republican administrations marvel at \nhow the White House does not seem to miss an opportunity to showcase \nMr. Bush in dramatic and perfectly lighted settings. It is all by \ndesign: the White House has stocked its communications operation with \npeople from network television who have expertise in lighting, camera \nangles and the importance of backdrops.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday, at a speech promoting his economic plan in Indianapolis, \nWhite House aides went so far as to ask people in the crowd behind \nMr. Bush to take off their ties, WISH-TV in Indianapolis reported, so \nthey would look more like the ordinary folk the president said would \nbenefit from his tax cut.\u0014\n\"They understand the visual as well as anybody ever has,\" said \nMichael K. Deaver, Ronald Reagan's chief image maker. \"They watched \nwhat we did, they watched the mistakes of Bush I, they watched how \nClinton kind of stumbled into it, and they've taken it to an art \nform.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe White House efforts have been ambitious  and costly. For the \nprime-time television address that Mr. Bush delivered to the nation \non the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the White House rented \nthree barges of giant Musco lights, the kind used to illuminate \nsports stadiums and rock concerts, sent them across New York Harbor, \ntethered them in the water around the base of the Statue of Liberty \nand then blasted them upward to illuminate all 305 feet of America's \nsymbol of freedom. It was the ultimate patriotic backdrop for Mr. \nBush, who spoke from Ellis Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a speech that Mr. Bush delivered last summer at Mount Rushmore, \nthe White House positioned the best platform for television crews off \nto one side, not head on as other White Houses have done, so that the \ncameras caught Mr. Bush in profile, his face perfectly aligned with \nthe four presidents carved in stone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd on Monday, for remarks the president made promoting his tax cut \nplan near Albuquerque, the White House unfurled a backdrop that \nproclaimed its message of the day, \"Helping Small Business,\" over and \nover. The type was too small to be read by most in the audience, but \njust the right size for television viewers at home.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't know who does it,\" Mr. Deaver said, \"but somebody's got a \ngood eye over there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat somebody, White House officials and television executives say, \nis in fact three or four people. First among equals is Scott Sforza, \na former ABC producer who was hired by the Bush campaign in Austin, \nTex., and who now works for Dan Bartlett, the White House \ncommunications director. Mr. Sforza created the White House \"message \nof the day\" backdrops and helped design the $250,000 set at the \nUnited States Central Command forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, \nduring the Iraq war.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Sforza works closely with Bob DeServi, a former NBC cameraman \nwhom the Bush White House hired after seeing his work in the 2000 \ncampaign. Mr. DeServi, whose title is associate director of \ncommunications for production, is considered a master at lighting. \n\"You want it, I'll heat it up and make a picture,\" he said early this \nweek. Mr. DeServi helped produce one of Mr. Bush's largest events, a \nspeech to a crowd in Revolution Square in Bucharest last November.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo stage the event, Mr. DeServi went so far as to rent Musco lights \nin Britain, which were then shipped across the English Channel and \ndriven across Europe to Romania, where they lighted Mr. Bush and the \ngiant stage across from the country's former Communist headquarters.\u0014\n\u0014\nA third crucial player is Greg Jenkins, a former Fox News television \nproducer in Washington who is now the director of presidential \nadvance. Mr. Jenkins manages the small army of staff members and \nvolunteers who move days ahead of Mr. Bush and his entourage to set \nup the staging of all White House events.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We pay particular attention to not only what the president says but \nwhat the American people see,\" Mr. Bartlett said. \"Americans are \nleading busy lives, and sometimes they don't have the opportunity to \nread a story or listen to an entire broadcast. But if they can have \nan instant understanding of what the president is talking about by \nseeing 60 seconds of television, you accomplish your goals as \ncommunicators. So we take it seriously.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe president's image makers, Mr. Bartlett said, work within a budget \nfor White House travel and events allotted by Congress, which for \nfiscal 2003 was $3.7 million. He said he did not know the specific \ncost of staging Mr. Bush's Sept. 11 anniversary speech, or what the \nWhite House was charged for the lights. A spokeswoman at the \nheadquarters of Musco Lighting in Oskaloosa, Iowa, said the company \ndid not disclose the prices it charged clients. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhite House communications operatives in previous administrations \nsaid many costs of presidential trips were paid for by whoever was \ndeemed the official host of a trip  typically a federal agency, a \ncity or a company. Trips deemed political are paid for by the parties.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The total cost of a trip is ultimately shared across a wide spectrum \nof agencies and hosts,\" said Joshua King, who was director of \nproduction of presidential events in the Clinton administration. \"To \nget to who really pays for presidential events would keep a team of \naccountants very busy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most elaborate  and criticized  White House event so far was \nMr. Bush's speech aboard the Abraham Lincoln announcing the end of \nmajor combat in Iraq. White House officials say that a variety of \npeople, including the president, came up with the idea, and that Mr. \nSforza embedded himself on the carrier to make preparations days \nbefore Mr. Bush's landing in a flight suit and his early evening \nspeech.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedia strategists noted afterward that Mr. Sforza and his aides had \nchoreographed every aspect of the event, even down to the members of \nthe Lincoln crew arrayed in coordinated shirt colors over Mr. Bush's \nright shoulder and the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner placed to \nperfectly capture the president and the celebratory two words in a \nsingle shot. The speech was specifically timed for what image makers \ncall \"magic hour light,\" which cast a golden glow on Mr. Bush.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you looked at the TV picture, you saw there was flattering light \non his left cheek and slight shadowing on his right,\" Mr. King said. \n\"It looked great.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trip was attacked by Democrats as an expensive political stunt, \nbut White House officials said that Democrats needed a better issue \nfor taking on the president. A New York Times/CBS News nationwide \npoll conducted May 9-12 found that the White House may have been \nright: 59 percent of those polled said it was appropriate, and not an \neffort to make political gain, for Mr. Bush to dress in a flight suit \nand announce the end of combat operations on the aircraft carrier.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even this White House makes mistakes. One of the more notable \nones occurred in January, when Mr. Bush delivered a speech about his \neconomic plan at a St. Louis trucking company. Volunteers for the \nWhite House covered \"Made in China\" stamps with white stickers on \nboxes arrayed on either side of the president. Behind Mr. Bush was a \nprinted backdrop of faux boxes that read \"Made in U.S.A.,\" the \nmessage the administration wanted to convey to the television \naudience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe White House takes great pride in the backdrops, which are created \nby Mr. Sforza, and has gone so far as to help design them for \nuniversities where Mr. Bush travels to make commencement addresses. \nLast year, the White House helped design a large banner for Ohio \nState as part of the background for Mr. Bush; last week, the White \nHouse collaborated with the University of South Carolina to make \nSforzian backdrops for a presidential commencement speech in the \nschool's new Carolina Center.\u0014\n\"They really are good,\" said Russ McKinney, the school's director of \npublic affairs, as he listened to the president.\u0014\n\u0014\nTelevision camera crews, meanwhile, say they have rarely had such \nconsistently attractive pictures to send back to editing rooms.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They seem to approach an event site like it's a TV set,\" said Chris \nCarlson, an ABC cameraman who covers the White House. \"They dress it \nup really nicely. It looks like a million bucks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven for standard-issue White House events, Mr. Bush's image makers \nwatch every angle. Last week, when the president had a joint news \nconference with Prime Minister Jos Mari Aznar of Spain, it was \nstaged in the Grand Foyer of the White House, under grand marble \ncolumns, with the Blue Room and a huge cream-colored bouquet of \nflowers illuminated in the background. (Mr. Sforza and Mr. DeServi \ncould be seen there conferring before the cameras began rolling.) The \nscene was lush and rich, filled with the beauty of the White House in \nreal time.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They understand they have to build a set, whether it's an aircraft \ncarrier or the Rose Garden or the South Lawn,\" Mr. Deaver said. \"They \nunderstand that putting depth into the picture makes the candidate or \npresident look better.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOr as Mr. Deaver said he learned long ago with Mr. Reagan: \"They \nunderstand that what's around the head is just as important as the \nhead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "title": "KING LEOPOLD AND THE HORRORS OF THE CONGO",
    "words": "At the turn of the 20th century, ghastly stories of torture in the \nBelgian Congo became common in Europe and America. It slowly became \nevident that Belgium's King Leopold II (1835-1909), in his desire for \nprofit, was using his mercenary troops to promote atrocities, going \nso far as to use slavery, starvation, and mutilations to enforce the \nstate collection of ivory and rubber. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 19th century, the giant Congo region in central Africa \nhad been the scene of vicious exploitation by European rubber \ncompanies and mining concerns. Ironically, King Leopold II's \nabsolute, personal control over what became known as the Belgian \nCongo was given to him by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, on the \nbasis of his claim that he would end slavery there and create a \nhumanitarian Eden for the abused Congolese. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Civilize\" was Leopold's favorite word, and at first the public \nbelieved him, seeing him as a fatherly philanthropist. Leopold \ndiscouraged any visitors to the Congo who might refute this image, \nbut eventually, tales began to leak out (Leopold finally lost control \nof the colony in 1908, when it was formally annexed by Belgium.) \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most famous horror story to come out of Leopold's Congo \nwas the report of hands of \"reluctant\" Congolese slaves being severed \nand smoked over a slow fire as a warning to others.

The season begins in \nmid-November and ends in the last week May. In the current year, \nuntil February 23, the beasts killed 17 people  14 mahouts and three \nothers. And many were injured either in the attacks or due to \ncommotion. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time the season comes to an end, 45-50 persons have lost their \nlives and a few hundred maimed. The figures show that elephants owned \nby private parties are the one losing control and ones owned by \ntemples, especially those managed by the government, are relatively \ncalm. \u0014\n\u0014\nPrivate owners treat their elephant as machines. The animals are \ntransported from one festival to the other until the season ends. \nThey are denied proper food and rest. They are paraded for hours \nunder the scorching sun and spend the nights with heavy iron chains \nfastened to their legs. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdding to their woes, during the night, clusters of burning torches \nare held in front of the parading elephants so that the caparison on \ntheir heads and other ornaments on them glitter in the dark. And to \nadd to the din, drummers playing for long periods and the loud \nfireworks at the end of the procession.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the calmest of elephants turn violent under such hostile \nsituations and become marauders,'' said Dr Sreekumar, a veterinarian. \u0014\n\u0014\nCall for repeal of law \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the present situation, it seems that the law protecting these \nanimals has been been flouted. \u0014\n\u0014\nForest Minister B.

    "title": "KENNEDY'S FINEST MOMENT",
    "words": "Kennedy's Finest Moment\u0014\n\u0014\nBy PENIEL E. JOSEPH   June 10, 2013   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMEDFORD, Mass.  JUNE 11, 1963, may not be a widely recognized date \nthese days, but it might have been the single most important day in \ncivil rights history. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat morning, Gov. George Wallace, in an effort to block the \nintegration of the University of Alabama, made his futile stand at \nthe schoolhouse door. That evening, Boston N.A.A.C.P. leaders \nengaged in their first public confrontation with Louise Day Hicks, \nthe chairwoman of the Boston School Committee, over de facto public \nschool segregation, beginning a decade-long struggle that would boil \nover into spectacular violence during the early 1970s. And just after \nmidnight in Jackson, Miss., a white segregationist murdered the civil \nrights leader Medgar Evers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the most important event was one that almost didn't happen: a \nhastily arranged speech that evening by President John F. Kennedy. \u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy had dabbled with the idea of going on TV should the Alabama \ncrisis drag out, so when it ended, his staff assumed the plan was \noff. But that afternoon he surprised them by calling the three \nnetworks and personally requesting airtime at 8 p.m. He told his \nspeechwriter Theodore Sorensen to start drafting the text, but \nshortly before he went on air the president was still editing it. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe president had been routinely criticized by black leaders for \nbeing timid on civil rights, and no one knew just what to expect when \nthe cameras started filming.\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy began slowly and in a matter-of-fact manner, with an \nannouncement that the National Guard had peacefully enrolled two \nblack students at the University of Alabama over Wallace's \nvociferously racist objections. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut he quickly spun that news into a plea for national unity behind \nwhat he, for the first time, called a moral issue. It seems obvious \ntoday that civil rights should be spoken of in universal terms, but \nat the time many white Americans still saw it as a regional, largely \npolitical question. And yet here was the leader of the country, \nasking every American, regardless of where he lives, to stop and \nexamine his conscience. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen he went further. Speaking during the centennial of the \nEmancipation Proclamation  an anniversary he had assiduously avoided \ncommemorating, earlier that year  Kennedy eloquently linked the fate \nof African-American citizenship to the larger question of national \nidentity and freedom. America, for all its hopes and all its \nboasts, observed Kennedy, will not be fully free until all its \ncitizens are free. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most significant part of the speech came near the end, \nwhen Kennedy, borrowing directly from the movement's rhetoric, \nrecognized the civil rights struggle as part of a political and \ncultural revolution sweeping the land  again, an obvious point to \nanyone on the other side of the 1960s, but not to a white population \nstill living in the stifling bliss of the Eisenhower era.\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy not only reported the revolution, but invited Americans of \nall backgrounds to engage in the kind of civic activism that reflects \nthe tough work of democracy. A great change is at hand, and our \ntask, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, \npeaceful and constructive for all. \u0014\n\u0014\nNor was this just stirring rhetoric: Kennedy's announcement that he \nwould introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation and spur \nschool desegregation beyond its frustratingly glacial pace gave teeth \nto his historic address.\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy's speech was almost immediately overshadowed by Evers's \nmurder. Two months later the March on Washington would further render \nit a forgotten artifact of the civil rights movement's heroic period. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the speech had real consequences. A little over a week later, \nKennedy followed through on his promise to submit strong civil rights \nlegislation to Congress, which he pushed aggressively until his \nassassination in November 1963. \u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy's death made him a martyr for many causes, and in a cruel \ntwist, it provided a huge boost to the civil rights bill, which his \nsuccessor, Lyndon B. Johnson, signed on July 2, 1964. But without the \nmoral forcefulness of the June 11 speech, the bill might never have \ngone anywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe speech also set the tone for how presidents should address civil \nrights. No longer could they dance around the issue, qualifying it as \na strictly regional or legal or economic issue (though many would \nlater try to do so). The power of the White House, and of the federal \ngovernment, was on the side of the struggle. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it continues to resonate today. Barack Obama's March 2008 race \nspeech, delivered amid the Jeremiah Wright controversy, has been \nrightfully applauded for its nuanced depiction of contemporary \nAmerican race relations. And yet it must be read within the context \nof Kennedy's address: both reflected and defined the tenor of race \nrelations at a moment of great tension and change.\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy's words anticipated some of the key themes found in King's \nsoaring March on Washington address two months later. And that shared \nmoral force, that commonality of thinking between the two speeches, \nis the most important reason to remember the president's address, 50 \nyears ago today: it reminds us of a forgotten moment of the civil \nrights era, when presidential leadership and grass-roots activism \nworked in creative tension to turn the narrative of civil rights from \na regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and \ndemocratic renewal. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeniel E. Joseph, the founding director of the Center for the Study \nof Race and Democracy and a professor of history at Tufts University, \nis the author, most recently, of Dark Days, Bright Nights: From \nBlack Power to Barack Obama.\u0014",

Investigators said they believe that \nRitz became sick and died and that the dogs  many of which appeared \nnot to have had food or water for several days  consumed her body to \nsurvive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think it was just one lady that really wanted to save them all,\" \nTracey Ward, a county animal control official, told the station. \n\"When you don't spay and neuter, they're going to breed.

It said 34 more \ndogs were euthanized in 2003 because of poor temperament and health \nproblems.\u0014\n\u0014\nOhio County animal control officials were working Monday to rescue \nthe dogs that were found Saturday. Many are puppies, officials told \nWFIE, and others were described as \"extremely pregnant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRescue workers said the only saving grace of the situation was that \nthe mistreatment of animals at the property was over.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"After the sadness, there was relief,\" Mary Beth Kolb of \nAdopt-a-Husky told WFIE. \"There absolutely was relief that this will \nnever happen again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWard said the scene was \"overwhelming.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've been fighting tears a lot today,\" she said. \"I cannot \nunderstand why someone would live like this and put animals through \nthis.\"\u0014",

That is when the Franciscan \nfriar, Maximilian Kolbe, lifted up his arm to receive a lethal \ninjection of carbolic acid.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks earlier, a prisoner had escaped from Auschwitz. The camp's \nrule was that if one prisoner escaped, ten died in his place. All day \nthe weak and underfed men from the escaped prisoner's block were made \nto stand in the sun without food and water. When the man was not \nfound, a prison guard called out the names of ten men who were to die \nin his place.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sergeant Francis Gajowniczek heard his name called, he cried \nout, \"Have mercy! I have a wife and children.\" But mercy was a \ncommodity in short supply in Nazi death camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nInto the gap stepped Maximilian Kolbe. He moved forward silently. \nAsked what he wanted, he replied, \"I am a Catholic priest from \nPoland; I would like to take his place, because he has a wife and \nchildren.\" Hesitating a moment in face of this noble gesture, \nCommandant Fritsch accepted the replacement. Maximilian and nine \nothers were sent to starve to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring those two weeks, Maximilian led the victims in hymns and \nprayer. When he became too weak to speak aloud, he whispered his \nprayers. After two weeks, only four of the ten were still alive. \nMaximilian alone was completely conscious. The guards needed the \nspace for more prisoners and decided to hasten the deaths with lethal \ndoses of carbolic acid. Maximilian was last. Weak though he was, he \nraised his arm to receive the injection, triumphantly embracing \nmartyrdom. We know some of these details, because the guard who kept \nthe records was so impressed during Maximilian's two-week ordeal that \nhe logged more detail than was required.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch martyrs do not just happen by chance. Maximilian was born as \nRaymond Kolbe. Although a wild boy as a youth, he was moved by the \nprayers and pleas of his mother. One day when he was twelve, as he \nprayed before a statue of Mary he saw her in a vision; she offered \nhim two crowns: a white one for purity and red for martyrdom. Told to \nchoose between them, he asked for both. He became a Franciscan friar \nand took the name Maximilian.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis life was devoted to Mary. He founded an order which used the \nmeans of mass communication, including radio and a widely circulated \nnewspaper and magazine, to spread truth. \"No one in the world can \nchange Truth,\" he said. \"What we can do and should do is to seek \ntruth and to serve it when we have found it. The real conflict is the \ninner conflict. Beyond armies of occupation and the hecatombs of \nextermination camps, there are two irreconcilable enemies in the \ndepth of every soul: good and evil, sin and love. And what use are \nthe victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our \ninnermost personal selves?\" Indifference toward the things of God was \nthe deadliest enemy of any soul.

    "words": "Apparently when your God demands that infidels be wiped from the \nearth, sexual violation becomes a justifiable, even righteous method \nto secure true religion. After all, the oldest way to spread a \nreligion is not to evangelize people; its to create new ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis might have been the motive for the Israelites to take every \ngirl who has never slept with a man after their war against the \nMidianites. In disturbingly neutral terms, Numbers 31 describes Moses \ntelling 12,000 Israelite men to kill every male and every female who \nhas slept with a man (v. 18). Then, he instructs the men to take the \nfemale virgins as captives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe text doesnt say that the Israelites raped the women; according \nto Deuteronomy 2021, they would have made the captives their wives. \nStill, Numbers 31, Judges 21, Zechariah 14, and other Old Testament \npassages describe Gods people disobeying God's good design for sex \nand family, treating women as property, and forcing them into sexual \narrangements to add to the Israelite family.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wartime atrocities recounted in the Old Testament resemble many \nwe read about today. The Old Testament is an account of God's saving \nacts toward his people, but it is also an account of sinful human \nproclivity for depravity and domination. The foundational premise of \nthe Bible after Genesis 3 is that this fallen world, particularly \nfallen humanity, is violent, notes Reformed theologian Justin \nHolcomb. In light of the Fall, sex and childbirthacts intended to \ncreate and sustain life and loveare put to violent ends. And the \nruling with relationship between men and women described in Genesis \n12 is warped into ruling over.\u0014",

    "title": "KILLERS OF THE AUGUST MOON, BY DAVID GRANN ---BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "In the 1920s, the Osage found themselves in a unique position among \nNative Americans tribes. As other tribal lands were parceled out in \nan effort by the government to encourage dissolution and assimilation \nof both lands and culture, the Osage negotiated to maintain the \nmineral rights for their corner of Oklahoma, creating a kind of \nunderground reservation. It proved a savvy move; soon countless oil \nrigs punctured the dusty landscape, making the Osage very rich. And \nthats when they started dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoud think the Osage Indian Reservation murders would have been a \nbigger story, one as familiar as the Lindbergh kidnapping or Bonnie \nand Clyde. It has everything, but at scale: Execution-style \nshootings, poisonings, and exploding houses drove the body count to \nover two dozen, while private eyes and undercover operatives scoured \nthe territory for clues. Even as legendary and infamous oil barons \nvied for the most lucrative leases, J. Edgar Hoovers investigation  \nwhich he would leverage to enhance both the prestige and power of his \nfledgling FBI - began to overtake even the towns most respected \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nExhuming the massive amount of detail is no mean feat, and its even \nharder to make it entertaining. But journalist David Grann knows what \nhes doing. With the same obsessive attention to fact - in service to \nstorytelling - as The Lost City of Z, Killers of the Flower Moon \nreads like narrative-nonfiction as written by James M. Cain (there \nare, after all, insurance policies involved): smart, taut, and pacey. \nMost sobering, though, is how the tale is at once unsurprising and \nunbelievable, full of the arrogance, audacity, and inhumanity that \ncontinues to reverberate through todays headlines. --Jon Foro\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------------------------\u0014\n Based on years of research, it explores one of the most sinister \ncrimes and racial injustices in American history.\u0014\n---------------------------------------------\u0014\nThis is one of the most heartbreaking and terrifying books I have \never read. I hope that it becomes a staple of reading lists for \nAmerican history classes. It is an incredibly well told story of a \nstaggering real world evil in an America only two or three \ngenerations removed from our own. You should read it. It won't take \nlong - it is, though it feels crass to say so, a genuine page-turner. \nAnd I at least will likely wrestle with it for a long while. Man o \nman.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving been a huge horse racing fan when I was a teenager, I knew \nabout the wealth of the Osage Nation in the 1920s. One of the Osage \nowned a winner of the Kentucky Derby. But that knowledge was just \ncursory. I had no idea how rich the Osage really were, and I \ncertainly didn't have a clue that the government didn't trust them \nwith all that money. I should not have been so naive. It had to \nmadden many whites that, although they'd shoved the Osage onto a \npiece of land they deemed unfit for themselves, oil would be \ndiscovered and the Osage would turn out to be the wealthiest people \nin the world. The one way they had of trying to horn in on this \nwealth was by declaring that the Osage were not fit to use their own \nmoney wisely. In many cases whites were put in charge of the \nfamilies' money, and they gave their wards allowances (and themselves \nlarge fees for their business knowledge).\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nThis is an amazing, almost unbelievable, tale of extreme greed and \ninhumanity that is shared and practiced by an entire community \nagainst innocent and trusting people. Another very sad episode, in \nmodern times, in the cruel treatment of Native Americans.\u0014",

    "words": "Kris Exposed Hypocrisy, Injustices Id Not Seen\u0014\nby John D. Pierce | Mar 2, 2021 | \u0014\n\u0014\nThe announcement that Kris Kristofferson, now 84, is no longer making \npublic appearances has caused me to listen more attentively to  and \nreflect more deeply upon  the music of this walkin contradiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a mostly do-gooder youth growing up along the Georgia-Tennessee \nline, my risks and rebellion were mainly lived vicariously through \nthe music of Cash, Haggard and Kristofferson. But I learned some \nthings, especially from Kris.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis gravel-throated, poetic music flowed  along with my hair at the \ntime  from the windows of my 1969 Pontiac LeMans with a little \nfender damage. The 8-track tapes of Jesus Was a Capricorn and The \nSilver-Tongued Devil and I were on manual rotate and repeat.\u0014\n\u0014\nKris is my favorite songwriter and the first person I saw in concert \n performing with his then-wife Rita Coolidge at Chattanoogas \nMemorial Auditorium in the early 70s. He helped me to spot hypocrisy \nand to see social injustices in places I never knew to look.\u0014\n\u0014\nMother tells the ladies at the bridge club every day, of the rising \nprice of tranquilizers she must pay. And she wonders why the children \nnever seem to stay at home. Blame it on the Rolling Stones.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat policeman said, Mister Cool, if you aint drunk, then youre a \nfool. I said, If thats against the law, then tell me why I never \nsaw a man locked in that jail of yours who wasnt neither black or \npoor as me?\u0014\n\u0014\nDont wonder who them lawmen was protectin, when they nailed the \nSavior to the cross. Cause the law is for protection of the people. \nRules are rules and any fool can see. We dont need no \nriddle-speakin prophets scaring decent folks like you and me, no \nsiree!\u0014\n\u0014\nKris exposed sins of partiality and pretense that the church didnt  \nbecause they hit too close to home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe title track from Jesus Was a Capricorn conveyed some timely \nhippie culture but also challenged the nice, safe version of the \nJesus we good Americans had domesticated. And the Dobro playing of \nUncle Josh Graves of Flatt & Scruggs fame drove the message just \nright.\u0014\nLong hair, beard and sandals, and a funky bunch of friends. Reckon \nwed just nail Him up if He come down again.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday Morning Coming Down (when voiced so perfectly by Big John \nCash) paints a vivid and tragic reality. I can smell the chicken \nfrying and hear the church bells ringing  and feel the combined \nsense of loss and comfort they bring.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Me Lord is as confessional as any altar call response: Now \nthat I know that Ive needed you so, help me, Jesus, my souls in \nyour hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy favorite among favorites remains Lovin Her Was Easier. The \nphrasing is so colorful, well-crafted and sensuous that its hard to \nlift a preferred line or verse.\u0014\nWaking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin. \nWiping out the traces of the people and the places that Ive been. \nTeaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of \ntrying. Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time wed have to \nspend.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, oh, how Kris makes other singers better, putting the right words \nand tunes in their mouths. And how those singers bring his songs to \ngreater light and life.\u0014\nRay Price put such a perfect mellow touch on For the Good Times \nthat he had me turning away from any bridges that might be burning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no better turn-it-up-loud and sing-along song than Me and \nBobby McGee, whether voiced originally by Roger Miller or \nmore-popularly and powerfully by Janis Joplin, or the numerous other \nartists who cut it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody, it seems, recorded Help Me Make It Through the Night as \nwell  including Sammi Smith, Anne Murray, Willie Nelson, Tammy \nWynette, Gladys Knight, Engelbert Humperdinck, Charley Pride, Tom \nJones, Andy Williams, LeAnn Rimes and some guy named Elvis.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost or dying relationships are the staple of country music as Ronnie \nMillsap conveyed so movingly in Kris Please Dont Tell Me How the \nStory Ends.\u0014\nNevers just the echo of forever. Lonesome as the love that might \nhave been.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Rhodes scholar with a deep and wide knowledge of literature, and a \nmaster of language in his own right, Kris strung together words and \nchords with feeling, ease and magic. Many songs are deep  with \nlyrics worth pondering again and again.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few are just clever and edgy  and clearly not written while sober:\u0014\n\u0014\nI dig Bobby Dylan and I dig Johnny Cash, and I think Waylon Jennings \nis a table thumpin smash.

    "title": "KNOWING THE REAL JESUS",
    "words": "Jesus lived for roughly thirty-five years in 1st-century Palestine. \nEach of those years was filled with physical and psychological \nchanges. Even before he began his public ministry, many of his words \nand deeds would have been witnessed by his family and friends, his \nneighbors and customers. In principle, these events were available at \nthe time to the interested inquirer. Then, for the last three years \nor so of his life, much of what Jesus said and did occurred in public \nor at least before his disciples, especially those who traveled with \nhim. Again, in principle, these events were recoverable at the time \nto a zealous inquirer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet the vast majority of these deeds and words, the reasonably \ncomplete record of the real Jesus, is irrevocably lost to us \ntoday. This is no new insight of modern agnostic scholars. \nTraditionally Christianity has spoken of the hidden years of Jesus \nlifewhich amounted to all but three or four of them! The apocryphal \ngospels of the patristic period, mystical visions of medieval times, \nand modern speculation have sought to fill in the gap, but to no \navail. The real Jesus, even in the Richard Nixon sense of a \nreasonably complete record of public words and deeds, is unknown and \nunknowable. The reader who wants to know the real Jesus should close \nthis book right now, because the historical Jesus is neither the real \nJesus nor the easy way to him. The real Jesus is not available and \nnever will be. This is true not because Jesus did not existhe \ncertainly didbut rather because the sources that have survived do \nnot and never intended to record all or even most of the words and \ndeeds of his public ministryto say nothing of the rest of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMeier, J.

    "words": "Kill the Indian to Save America\u0014\nby Mitch Randall | Jul 8, 2021   Good Faith Media\u0014\n\u0014\nThe treatment surrounding First Nations and Native Americans over the \nlast 200 years has attracted renewed interest. Canada has located \nnearly 1,000 unmarked Indigenous graves near residential schools, and \nthe Biden administration has announced an investigation into American \nresidential schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the most recent edition of Good Faith Medias Nurturing Faith \nJournal and Bible Studies, I recalled the story of Eloise Childers, \nand her sister, Ruby. They were removed from their families and sent \nto the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School in Oklahoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, I visited Chilocco to walk in the footprints of the \nthousands of students who roamed the campus. Looking back at the \nphotos I took, I am now haunted by the images of the cemetery and \npossible unmarked graves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the turn of the 20th century, Muscogee Creek children, Eloise \nChilders and her sister, Ruby, were taken from their homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little girls were born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, located in what \nwas previously identified as Indian Territory after the Trail of \nTears in the 19th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls were relocated to the Chilocco Indian Agricultural Boarding \nSchool, over 130 miles northwest of their family and friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nChilocco was located 20 miles north of Ponca City near the \nOklahoma-Kansas border. The girls were forced to trade the green \nhills of Eastern Oklahoma for the flat prairie lands of North-Central \nOklahoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon arriving at Chilocco, the girls were told to strip down for a \nthorough scrubbing. After the bath, they were taken into a room where \ntheir long black hair was cut.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they left the room, they looked more like the strangers who \nbathed them than their own parents back in Broken Arrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls were not given back their Indigenous clothes. Gone were the \nsmooth fabrics of leather and the soft touch of feathers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn their place, a scratchy wool dress donned their skinny little \nframes that covered almost every inch of their bodies. Again, they \nwere looking more and more like the strangers that spoke to them in \nan unfamiliar language.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sisters fell asleep that night in a dark dormitory with other \nIndigenous children from different tribes that spoke unfamiliar \nlanguages. As they closed their eyes to discover their dreams, tears \nstreamed down their cheeks, afraid of their new surroundings and \nmissing the friendliness of home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls woke the next morning to the busy sounds of children \npreparing for breakfast and what many were calling school. After \nthe girls walked to the dining hall to have their breakfast, they \nwere marched to school rooms where a stern white-faced woman greeted \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls sheepishly smiled and said, Hensci, the traditional \ngreeting in Muscogee Creek.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stern-faced woman responded, Good morning. She then went on to \nutter a lot of other words the girls did not understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the incomprehensible lecture, they headed inside the school. \nFinding a seat in the classroom, another older student approached who \nspoke Muscogee Creek.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe informed the girls, They do not like us using our language. They \nwant us to use their language. They say it is better than ours. If we \ndo not learn to use it, we get whipped when we are caught using the \nlanguage of our ancestors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls looked at each other, more frightened now than ever before. \nBefore their journey, they were assured that coming to Chilocco and \nlearning the ways of the white man would be good. No one ever \nmentioned the possibility of whippings.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next several years, the girls learned the ways of white \nculture. They adopted their hairstyles, wore their clothes and spoke \ntheir language.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery now and again, they would sneak down to the pond away from the \ncampus to speak Muscogee Creek and recall stories of home. They were \ncaught a few times speaking their native tongue, which, just as the \nother student promised, ended in whippings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the most grievous of moments came on Sunday mornings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day started much like the weekdays. Yet, instead of attending \nschool after breakfast, the girls were marched to a small chapel \nwhere a man in a black robe met them. The students gathered inside to \nhear about a man called Jesus who wanted them to be good Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom what the girls could figure out, being a good Christian meant \nobeying their teachers, learning their lessons and following the ways \nof the white man.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when the stories of Jesus were told to the students, Eloise \nand Ruby thought this Jesus sounded more like their ancestors than \nthe white man telling the story. Yet, the girls just figured this was \nanother white riddle they needed to figure out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe worst part of Sunday mornings was when the girls felt like \nrunning to the pond instead of attending church. Because church \nattendance was recorded, their teachers knew when they had skipped. \nWhen the girls returned from their day at the pond, they were \nwelcomed back to the dorms by the stern-faced woman holding a whip.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls finally aged out of Chilocco, returning to Broken Arrow \nmuch different from when they left. They returned knowing the white \nmans ways but never fully understanding them.\u0014\n\u0014\nEloise and Ruby grew up to have children of their own, but both swore \nan oath never to send their children off to Chilocco.\u0014\n\u0014\nEloise ended up marrying a Muscogee Creek man by the name of \nMitchell, who possessed a vivid imagination and humorous personality. \nHe was a great baseball player, playing in the Indian leagues all \naround Eastern Oklahoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple had a daughter, and they named her Okema. Okema stayed \nwith Eloise and Mitchell all of her life, never having to suffer the \nfate of missing family and being forced to conform.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do I know so much about the story of Eloise and Ruby?\u0014\n\u0014\nEloise was my great-grandmother and Ruby, my great-aunt. I carry \ntheir story in my heart and soul, feeling the struggles of my \nancestors and honoring them with my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe evils and injustices of Americas founding are heard through the \nstories of the Indigenous peoples of North America and African slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chilocco Indian Agricultural Boarding School was modeled after \nthe Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. A former U.S. Army \ngeneral, Richard Pratt, founded the school.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pratt Doctrine, as it is known, argued that to save the \nIndigenous people, one must kill the Indian inside. Therefore, \nschools such as Carlisle and Chilocco stripped Indigenous children of \ntheir cultural identities to be replaced with a European and \nAnglo-centric worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more discouraging, the killing of the Indian was funded by the \nU.S government and carried out by Christian missionaries on the \nplains.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Eloise and Ruby accepted Jesus as their Lord and joined \nthe United Methodist Church late in life was a slight miracle, but, \nas I stated before, they thought Jesus was more like them than the \nmissionaries who introduced them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica has become a great country, but we must never forget that the \nachievements of today were at the expense of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndigenous people and African slaves lost their lands and lives in \norder for the American dream to emerge. The properties where American \nindustry now thrives are located on stolen lands and built by slave \nlabor.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs much as the ideas and practices of killing the Indian to save the \nman attempted to exterminate Indigenous peoples, they failed to kill \nthe spirits of Eloise and Ruby. The spirits of the sisters, and their \nfaith, now live on through me and my sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am NUMUKUTSU (Buffalo), otherwise known as Mitch Randall.\u0014",

    "words": "Thursday, July 29 - Daily Story \u0014\nOlaf Battled for Norway    Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Olaf used deadly force and dreadful mutilations to compel \nbaptism of the heathen and obtain conversions. \u0014\n \u0014\nKING OLAF II of Norway fell in battle on this day, 29 July 1030. In \nhis dying moments, he is said to have cried, God help me! \u0014\nAs a young man, Olaf Haraldsson fought as a Viking against Estonia, \nvisited Denmark (which then ruled Norway), and at first fought \nagainst, then later served with, the army of King Ethelred II of \nEngland against the Danes. When Ethelred was defeated and fled to \nNormandy, Olaf went with him. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile passing through Normandy, Olaf was baptized at Rouen under the \nsponsorship of the Norman king Richard II. But despite this, his \nbattles show a man consumed with political ambition, and his writings \nreveal a man more interested in sexual exploits than holiness. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Olaf returned to Norway in 1015, he obtained the support of some \nnorthern earls and defeated Earl Svein, the effectual ruler of the \ncountry. Olaf brought all of Norway under his control. Still a young \nman in his early twenties, he attempted to extend Christianity to the \ninner parts of the country where it was weakest, most likely for \nreasons of political unity. He summoned a church synod to Moster, \nwhere his people accepted a code covering the building and \nmaintenance of churches, establishments of the rights and duties of \nchurch officials, observance of holy days, instruction on baptism, \nrestriction on the exposure of infants (placing weak infants outside \nto be killed by the elements), conditions for burial, and rules for \nmarriage. The code also abolished the sacrifice of slaves to demons, \nrequiring that anyone wishing to offer such a sacrifice free the \nslave instead. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut despite some of the humane provisions of this code, Olaf still \nused deadly force and dreadful mutilations to compel baptism of the \nheathen and obtain conversions. This outraged his subjects. When \nKing Canute and the Danes invaded Norway, several earls deserted \nOlaf, who fled to Kiev. Canute established a puppet king in Norway, \nbut the man died in 1030, and Olaf saw an opportunity to regain his \nthrone. He returned to Norway, showing more mercy than in the past. \nAll the same, most Norwegians sided with the Danes. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the armies met at Stiklestad, Olaf chose as his battle cry, On, \non, Christs men! Cross men! Kings men! Outnumbered, he died \nthere.  His mortal wound was delivered in revenge by a man whose ship \nhe had captured. However, although his foes were largely of the old \nheathen party, they granted Olaf and his men Christian burials. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he had offered no evidence of holiness while he lived, the \npeople of Norway credited Olaf with miracles after his death. When \nCanute failed to keep his promises and raised taxes, the memory of \nOlaf began to look better to those who had revolted against him. His \nfriend Bishop Grimkell declared him a martyr saint. In the following \ncentury, Pope Alexander III confirmed the declaration. \u0014\n\u0014\nRulers of Norway, faced with the need to unite the country, found in \nOlafs memory an icon of national pride. They made him the nations \npatron saint, which proved to have a strong unifying effect.  What \nOlaf had hoped to achieve in life was achieved through his name after \nhis death.\u0014",

(AP) - A 72-year-old man considered one of \nCalifornia's most notorious child molesters was ordered to spend the \nrest of his life in prison Thursday for trying to buy a young boy for \n$500.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandcuffed to his wheelchair in court, Kenneth Parnell - the \nkidnapper in the infamous Steven Stayner case - was sentenced to 25 \nyears to life for trying to persuade a woman to purchase a 4-year-old \nboy for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nParnell was arrested in January 2003. The woman went to police after \nParnell handed over $100 in exchange for the fictitious boy's birth \ncertificate.\u0014\n\u0014\n``He has been a danger to children his entire life,'' prosecutor Tim \nWellman said Thursday.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, Parnell's lawyer, Deborah Levy, said he simply wanted to raise \nan abandoned boy and that ``he did not at all harm or attempt to harm \nanyone in this community.''\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors described Parnell as a lifelong predator. He already \nspent five years in prison for abducting two boys decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was convicted in 1982 of abducting 7-year-old Stayner in 1972, \nchanging the boy's name and keeping him for seven years.\u0014\n\u0014\nStayner escaped in early 1980, after Parnell abducted 5-year-old \nTimmy White. Taking the boy with him, Stayner, then 14, told \nauthorities he was regularly sexually abused and didn't want Timmy to \ngo through the same ordeal. He also said Parnell led him to believe a \ncourt had awarded him custody because Stayner's family could no \nlonger afford him.\u0014\n\u0014\nStayner's story was told in a book and TV movie, ``I Know My First \nName is Steven.'' He died in a motorcycle accident in 1989 at age 24.\u0014\n\u0014\nWellman said that Stayner's mother and White pressed him to push for \nthe maximum punishment for Parnell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWellman argued that the felony conviction made Parnell eligible for \nlife imprisonment under California's ``three strikes'' law. At trial, \nhe said Parnell wanted one ``last hurrah'' when he sought to buy the \nchild.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn sentencing Parnell, Superior Court Judge Julie Conger called him \n``a poster child for the three strikes law.''\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n04/15/04 CNN\u0014",

    "words": "Killing with Kindness\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is the church against euthanasia in instances where people are in \nterrible pain?\u0014\nAnswered by David P. Gushee | \u0014\n\u0014\nLet's respond to this question through the eyes of the family caring \nfor a sick or dying loved one, because that is the context in which \nmost of us face this agonizing issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not like to see loved ones sick, dying, or in pain. It goes \nagainst nature, moral training, and Christian faith to sit happily by \nwhen they suffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur first instinct will be to try to find a way to save their lives. \nWe will be supportive of aggressive treatment for as long as our \nloved one, the rest of the family, and the medical team hold out hope \nfor a cure.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen such hope is no longer realistic and death is imminent and \ncertain, we try to make our loved one as comfortable as possible. \nThere will be little debate that even if the family ends now-futile \nmedical treatments (such as chemotherapy), all reasonable efforts \nmust be made to alleviate suffering. Beyond hoping for a miracle, all \nwho love the dying person will pray for a peaceful death soon.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo far, so good. The question, however, seems to presuppose that this \nstrategy is not good enough when the dying person is in \"terrible \npain.\" At that point, it is implied, Christians are hardhearted in \nnot supporting euthanasia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a widely held view today. But it is wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst we need to define some terms. Most thoughtful bioethicists or \nphysicians accept the legitimacy of withholding or withdrawing \nmedical treatments when they are no longer bringing benefit to an \nirretrievably dying patient. Nor is there any opposition to \naggressive use of painkillers and other forms of palliative care.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut euthanasia is a different thing when it means (more than simply \nwithdrawing medical treatment) ordering or implementing some act that \nkills a dying person: whether it is a lethal injection, an overdose \nof drugs, intentional starvation, or a gunshot to the head. Morally, \nit matters little if we do the deed ourselves, give our loved one the \nmeans to do the deed, or pay the doctor to do it. In any case, we are \ninvolved in an act that directly brings about the death of another \nhuman being.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is correct in implying that the church, or at least the \ngreat majority of its moral thinkers and traditions, opposes \neuthanasia. This opposition is based ultimately on the commandment \n\"You shall not murder,\" but is articulated in various other ways, \nincluding:\u0014\n\u0014\n the belief that the intentional taking of the life of a person who \nposes no threat to the community is a form of murder and is thus \nintrinsically wrong, even if it is done with good motives;\u0014\n\u0014\n the fear that the freedom to put to death sick or dying people is a \nviolation of the mandate of the medical profession and would thus \ndeeply corrupt it;\u0014\n\u0014\n the fear that base motives such as financial gain will interfere \nwith the family decision-making process and lead to what is \nessentially sanctioned family murder of the old;\u0014\n\u0014\n the fear, based on historical experience, that political leaders \nwill take over the power to kill the infirm and sick and use it to \ncut the government's medical expenses or advance some kind of \nperverse vision of the common good;\u0014\n\u0014\n an intuitive sense that a good and loving family, or a good and \nloving nation, will find some way to show its compassion to the sick \nand suffering that does not involve directly taking their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentally, Christians oppose euthanasia because it simply does \nnot fit with core Christian theological convictions. God is Creator, \nnot us (Gen. 1:1). Human life is in his hands (Job 1:21). Illness and \ndeath are a tragic part of life in a sin-sick world (Gen. 3:19), and \nwe must fight them hardas Jesus fought them hard (Mt. 4:24). The \ntime will come when every person's earthly life is over. At that \npoint, our only hope lies in the resurrection promised to those who \nbelong to Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 15:50-56).\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are called to heal the sick where we can, comfort the dying \nalways, and entrust the dead to God. But we are never called, and we \nare never free, to hasten the dying across the threshold into \neternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid P. Gushee is the Graves Professor of Moral Philosophy at Union \nUniversity in Jackson, Tennessee.\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today. \u0014\nDecember 2004, Vol. 48, No. 12, Page 62\u0014",

    "title": "KAIROS MOMENTS",
    "words": "The New Testament was written originally in common Greek and the \nGreeks had \u0014\nseveral different words for our one word love. \u0014\n\u0014\nAgape = unconditional love \u0014\nEros = erotic bargaining love (Ill do this for you if you do that \nfor me, \u0014\nwhich, if you think about it, is not really love at all) \u0014\nPhileo = philanthropic, brotherly, sisterly, or humanitarian love \u0014\nStorge = family love. \u0014\n\u0014\nNew Testament Greek also had two words for time  chronos and kairos. \u0014\n\u0014\nChronos, which give us our word chronology, is tick-tock time. Each \nsecond \u0014\nis exactly like the one that preceded and the one that follows it. It \nis \u0014\nboring time, humdrum time, drudgery time, meaningless time, empty \ntime. Let \u0014\nme paint the picture of chronos time. \u0014\n\u0014\nImagine a convict in a prison cell; a lawyer with insomnia, who hears \nthe \u0014\nunrelenting incessant ticking of a clock; an office worker who hates \nhis job \u0014\nand cant wait for 5:00 to come so he can get out of there; a college \u0014\nstudent in a 3-hour biology lab (right after lunch) all experience \nchronos \u0014\ntime. Chronos time is empty time; it is a void that must be filled. \nIt is \u0014\ntime we must put in or endure. Its what we are talking about when, \nof \u0014\nall things, we talk about killing time. So, chronos equals \ntick-tock \u0014\ntime, humdrum time, boring time, and routine time. \u0014\n\u0014\nThank God, there is another kind of time. Its called kairos. Kairos \ntime \u0014\nis full time, vital time, crucial time, decisive time, Gods time. \nKairos \u0014\nmoments are those powerful, extra-special moments that are packed \nwith \u0014\nmeaning. While chronos is tick-tock time, kairos is when time stands \nstill. \u0014\nHow long has it been since you a moment so powerful that time stood \nstill? \u0014\nKairos is when God breaks into the routine and speaks loud and clear \nand you \u0014\nare touched so powerfully deep in your soul that you can never be the \nsame \u0014\nagain. A cartoonist depicts an idea with a light bulb flashing. It is \na \u0014\nVoila! moment, an ah ha experience. Theologians call it the moment \nof \u0014\nrevelation. \u0014\n\u0014\nKairos is a key word in the New Testament. When Jesus started his \nministry \u0014\nhe came into Galilee preaching and saying, The time is fulfilled. \nThe \u0014\nKingdom is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel. And the word \nfor \u0014\ntime there in Mark 1 was not chronos, it was kairos. This was \ncrucial \u0014\ntime, decisive time, Gods time. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus life was packed with kairos moments: \u0014\n\u0014\nZacchaeus  he saw him in that sycamore tree. They connected and that \nwas a \u0014\nkairos moment. \u0014\nBlind Bartimaeus  nobody else was paying attention to him but Jesus \nheard \u0014\nhis cries, connected with him, and it was a kairos moment. \u0014\nThe hemorrhaging woman came up behind Jesus, touched his robe, and he \u0014\nconnected with her, and it was a kairos moment. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus had so many of those moments. We read one this morning: The \nkairos is \u0014\nfulfilled. And what did Jesus do right at that kairos moment? He \ncalled his \u0014\ndisciples. It was a meaningful moment for them. It wasnt just \nanother tick \u0014\nof the clock. How long has it been since you had a powerful moment \nlike \u0014\nthat, that changed your life forever? How long has it been since you \nhad a \u0014\nkairos moment in a chronos world? Kairos moments are all around us if \nwe \u0014\nhave the eyes to see them, the ears to hear them, and the hearts to \nfeel \u0014\nthem.\u0014",

And when we learn that for a \nhundred-plus years in the early Middle Ages arguments raged over \npictures of Jesus, causing one of the greatest political, cultural \nand religious upheavals in Christian Historywell, we just don't \nunderstand it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it about icons that created such a stir, and what do they \nrepresent to the Orthodox?\u0014\nA little bloody history\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the 700s, icons were a regular feature of Orthodox spiritual life \nall over the Byzantine Empire. And it was about that time that a \nmovement against icons emerged. Iconoclasm (the movement to \"smash \nicons\") started from within the church itself. A few iconoclastic \nbishops in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) believed the Bible, \nparticularly , forbade such images:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything \nin heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You \nshall not bow down to them or worship them . \"\u0014\n\u0014\nByzantine Emperor Leo III (reigned 717-741), convinced by such \nreasoning, tried at first to persuade his subjects to abandon icons. \nA dramatic act of nature reinforced his campaign: a violent \nunderwater volcano suddenly erupted in the Aegean Sea; tidal waves \nsurged over land, and a cloud of volcanic ash darkened the sky. The \nentire city of Constantinople was shaken. Leo interpreted it as a \nsign from heaven: the empire was in grave danger of incurring the \ndivine wrath. So he preached a series of sermons against the use of \nicons.\u0014",

    "title": "KARL BARTH",
    "words": "Karl Barth is considered by some the greatest Protestant theologian \nof the 20th century and possibly the greatest since the Reformation. \nMore than anyone else, Barth inspired and led the renaissance of \ntheology that took place from about 1920 to 1950. The son of the \nSwiss Reformed minister and New Testament scholar Fritz Barth, Karl \nBarth was born in Basel, May 10, 1886, and was reared in Bern, where \nhis father taught. From 1904 to 1909, he studied theology at the \nuniversities of Bern, Berlin, Tbingen, and Marburg. In 1913 he \nmarried Nelly Hoffman; they had five children. Barth became known as \na radical critic both of the prevailing liberal theology and of the \nsocial order. Liberal theology, Barth believed, had accommodated \nChristianity to modern culture. The crisis of World War I was in part \na symptom of this unholy alliance. In his famous commentary Epistle \nto the Romans (1919; trans. 1933), Barth stressed the discontinuity \nbetween the Christian message and the world. He rejected the typical \nliberal points of contact between God and humanity in feeling or \nconsciousness or rationality, as well as Catholic tendencies to trust \nin the church or spirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarth held professorships successively at Gttingen and Mnster \nuniversities from 1923 to 1930, when he was appointed professor of \nsystematic theology at the University of Bonn. He engaged in \ncontroversy with Adolf von Harnack, holding that the latter's \nscientific theology is only a preliminary to the true task of \ntheology, which is identical with that of preaching. He opposed the \nHitler regime in Germany and supported church-sponsored movements \nagainst National Socialism; he was the chief author of the Barmen \nDeclaration, six articles that defined Christian opposition to \nNational Socialist ideology and practice. In 1934 he was expelled \nfrom Bonn and returned to Switzerland; from 1935 until his retirement \nin 1962 was professor at Basel, exercising a worldwide influence. \nDuring this period he worked on his Church Dogmatics (1932-68), a \nmultivolume work of great richness that was unfinished at his death. \nHe remained in Basel until his death, December 10, 1968.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe principal emphasis in Barth's work, known as neoorthodoxy and \ncrisis theology, is on the sinfulness of humanity, God's absolute \ntranscendence, and the human inability to know God except through \nrevelation. His objective was to lead theology away from the \ninfluence of modern religious philosophy back to the principles of \nthe Reformation and the prophetic teachings of the Bible. He regarded \nthe Bible, however, not as the actual revelation of God but as only \nthe record of that revelation. For Barth, God's sole revelation of \nhimself is in Jesus Christ. God is the \"wholly other,\" totally unlike \nmankind, who are utterly dependent on an encounter with the divine \nfor any understanding of ultimate reality. Barth saw the task of the \nchurch as that of proclaiming the \"good word\" of God and as serving \nas the \"place of encounter\" between God and mankind. Barth regarded \nall human activity as being under the judgment of that encounter.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarth's first attempt at dogmatics was a volume of a Christian \nDogmatics, published in 1927, which he judged to be a false start. \nThen in his study of Anselm of Canterbury he found a catalyst leading \nto what he called a breakthrough. He discovered in Anselm's \"faith \nseeking understanding\" that theology did not have to justify itself \nby some outside criterion; it has its own rationality and internal \ncoherence in the form of witness to the event of Jesus Christ. This \ngave him confidence in his study of the gospel and in the fact that \ntheology was a fully rational procedure, and he began his Church \nDogmatics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church Dogmatics is in four \"volumes,\" each comprising between \ntwo and four large tomes. Volume I is on the doctrine of the Word of \nGod. Volume I/1 is about the three forms of the Word of God \n(preached, written, and revealed) and the nature of the Trinity. \nVolume I/2 treats the three forms in more detail -- the revealed form \nin the incarnation of the Word of Jesus Christ, the written form in \nScripture and the preached form in church proclamation.\u0014\n\u0014\nVolume II is on the doctrine of God. Volume II/1 treats the knowledge \nof God, the main emphasis being on God's initiative in revealing \nhimself. Then Barth treats the reality of God. He describes God as \n\"one who loves in freedom,\" and there is an exposition of the \n\"perfections of the divine loving\" (grace, holiness, mercy, \nrighteousness, patience, and wisdom), and the \"perfections of the \ndivine freedom\" (unity, omnipresence, constancy, omnipotence, \neternity, and glory). Volume II/2 is on the election of God, Barth's \nterm for predestination. Barth transforms the doctrine of his own \nCalvinist tradition of double predestination by centering rejection \nand election in Jesus Christ, who takes all rejection on himself and \nalso both elects all and is himself elected. Christ's election leads \nto the election of the community of Israel and the church, and only \nin that context is it right to talk about the election or rejection \nof the individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nVolume III is on the doctrine of creation. Volume III/1 is on God's \nwork of creation, its goodness and the relation of creation to God's \ncovenant. Volume III/2 is on human being. Jesus Christ is the \"real\" \nhuman being and the criterion for true humanity. Volume III/3 covers \nprovidence, evil as an \"impossible possibility\" which has no future, \nand heaven, angels, and demons. Volume III/4 treats the ethical side \nof the doctrine of creation. God gives the freedom to live in \ngratitude before God, with other people, in respect for life and in \nlimitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarth completed the first three parts of Volume IV and partially \ncompleted part 4. Considering the doctrine of reconciliation, in \nVolume IV he interweaves the themes of Christology, sin, soteriology, \npneumatology, ecclesiology, justification, sanctification, and \nvocation. Christ is the servant, the judge who is judged in our place \nand who empties himself, the royal man who is raised up by God; He is \nthe true witness, the victor over all that opposes him, and the light \nof life. Specific aspects of sin are exposed by each aspect of Christ \n-- pride resists accepting what God become man does for us; sloth \nrefuses to take an active part in the new life given by Christ; \nfalsehood resists and distorts the witness of Christ. The way of \nhuman salvation is justification by faith through which the Christian \ncommunity is gathered, sancification in love through which the \ncommunity is built up, and vocation in hope, which sends the \ncommunity out as witnesses in word and life. Barth did not live to \nwrite any of the projected final Volume V on eschatology.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Barth's uncompromising positions were a great strength \nduring the period of Nazi power, his views were increasingly \nsubjected to criticism in the following decades. Some argue that he \nwas too negative in his estimate of mankind and its reasoning powers \nand too narrow in limiting revelation to the biblical tradition, thus \nexcluding the non-Christian religions. He gives such radical priority \nto God's activity that some critics find human activity and freedom \ndevalued. Barth sees revelation and salvation as given by God and \nvalid quite apart from the subjective responses of human beings, and \nthis is questioned as regards how far it takes account of the \nimportance of human response to God. Barth's realism apparently \naroused controversy; Barth takes a middle way between literalism (a \none-to-one correspondence between our language and God) and pure \nsymbolism or expressivism (no real preference at all). He takes a \nsimilar position on the historicity of the Gospel narratives; they \nare not necessarily literal history, nor are they myth or fiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong Barth's other better known works are The Word of God and the \nWord of Man (1924; trans. 1928), Credo (1935; trans. 1936), and \nEvangelical Theology, an Introduction (1962; trans. 1963). His works \nhave influenced many theologians positively and negatively, including \nRudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Hans Kng, \nJrgen Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Eberhard Jngel, and many \ntheologians from beyond continental Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nReferences:\u0014\n1996 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia, Copyright 1996 Grolier \nInteractive, Inc.\u0014\nMicrosoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia, Copyright 1993-1997 Microsoft \nCorporation.\u0014\nThe Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought, ed.

    "title": "KRISTALLNACHT-- A BOOK REVIEW\n----\nA BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Review by Dennis Showalter\u0014\n\u0014\nCrystal Night, the Night of Broken Glass, November 9-10, 1938, was \nthe public event most clearly foreshadowing the Holocaust. Described \nby Nazi officials as a spontaneous manifestation of popular \nhostility, it was in fact an organized pogrom. Over a thousand \nsynagogues were destroyed. Tens of thousands of businesses and homes \nwere ransacked and vandalizedthe windows of shattered glass on \nGermanys streets gave the event its name. Jews were attacked \nthroughout Germany: insulted, harassed, beaten. Almost a hundred were \nkilled. Thirty thousand more were thrown into concentration camps, \nsometimes for months. Over a thousand died. Other Jews committed \nsuicidenot least from despair and incomprehension at being \nfundamentally rejected by a Germany to which the Jewish community had \ncontributed so much.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Gilbert, best known as a biographer of Winston Churchill, also \nhas a distinguished reputation as a scholar of the Holocaust. In \naddition to archival and published sources, he makes extensive use of \ninterviews and manuscripts provided by survivors to construct a vivid \noverview of Crystal Night itself, the six years leading up to it, and \nthe responses of German Jews, the Nazi government, the German people, \nand, not least, the rest of the world. It was impossible to conceal \nthe nights work from the several hundred foreign journalists still \nin Germany. Their vivid reports contributed significantly to changing \nperceptions of Nazi Germany as a state like any other, whose Jewish \npolicies were in any case an internal affair.\u0014\n\u0014\nCrystal Night did not take place in a vacuum. Gilbert vividly and \neconomically describes its bitter prelude: the systematic legal and \nsocial discrimination and persecution that isolated the Jews of \nHitlers Germany, stripping them of their rights, their jobs, and \ntheir property. He describes the harsh aftermath, with violence \nescalating as increasing numbers of Jews sought asylum in a world \nwhose sympathy remained limited to words. He describes the mass \narrests and deportations that began with the outbreak of World War II \nand resulted in the destruction of Germanys Jewish community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe works core, however, is its treatment of the pogrom. Gilbert \nasserts they taught fundamental lessons. First among them is that a \nwhole people can be demonized; a whole nation can be turned against a \npart of it. German criticism protests focused more on the breakdown \nof order and the destruction of property than on the fate of the \nvictims. Crystal Night showed Germanys Jews that it was time to \nleave. Any hopes that the real Germany would somehow rise and sweep \naway the brown blight went up in the smoke of burning synagogues. \nCrystal Night taught Nazi planners that in the future they must act \nin secret. The less the outside world knew, the less likely was any \nserious interference. Finally, Crystal Night encouraged foreign \ngovernments to relax restrictions against Jewish immigration, with \nBritain in particular lowering its barriers.\u0014\n\u0014\nGilbert concludes by observing that evil can move smoothly and \neffectively to greater evil over relatively brief periods of time. \nResponses are likely to be late and limited. Eventually the Third \nReich was destroyed. But the costs were high and the losses \nirreplaceable.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Sir Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchills \nbiographer and the author of eight acclaimed books on the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER: Dennis Showalter has taught history at Colorado \nCollege since 1969 and is a former president of the Society for \nMilitary History. His book Tannenberg won the prestigious Paul \nBirdsall Prize.\u0014",

    "words": "A few years ago there was a true story about a man in New York City \nwho was kidnapped. His kidnappers called his wife and asked for \n$100,000 ransom. She talked them down to $30,000.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe story had a happy ending: the man returned home unharmed, the \nmoney was recovered, and the kidnappers were caught and sent to jail. \nBut, don't you wonder what happened when the man got home and found \nthat his wife got him back for a discount? Calvin Trillin was the \nwriter of this story. He imagined out loud what the negotiations must \nhave been like: \"$100,000 for that old guy? You have got to be crazy. \nJust look at him! Look at that gut! You want $100,000 for that? \nYou've got to be kidding. Give me a break here. $30,000 is my top \noffer.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nMark Trotter concluded his rendition of the story with this \nthoughtful comment: \"I suppose there are some here this morning who \ncan identify with the wife in that story, but for some reason I find \nmyself identifying with the husband. I'd like to think if I were in a \nsimilar situation, there would be people who would spare no expense \nto get me back. They wouldn't haggle over the price. They wouldn't \nsay, 'Well, let me think about it.' I like to think that they would \nsay, 'We'll do anything for you.'\"\u0014",

    "title": "KNOWING OUR BIBLE AND KNOWING OUR HISTORY",
    "words": "Roots Matter\u0014\nDefending the faith in today's cultural climate means not only \nknowing our Bible but also knowing our history.\u0014\nby Darrell L. Bock\u0014\n\u0014\nIt used to be that when I taught class and came to Gnosticism, eyes \nglazed over and clock-watching began. Mentioning Gnostics in church \njust never happened. The digital age of niche TV and \"History \nChannel\" documentaries has changed all that. The Gnostics are making \nprime time appearances and have agents. I get questions about them \nconstantly.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are now in a period when it is not enough to know only about the \nBible. The apologetics of the past is no longer adequate. Today's \nquestions involve not only how the Bible came to be, but even if \nthere was originally such a thing as orthodoxy. It is a crucial \nquestion. Christians need to know a lot more about the second \ncentury. Roots matter, especially in the founding of a movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne question often raised is how there could be \"orthodoxy\" when \nthere was no functioning New Testament until sometime between the \nlate second and the fourth century. Doesn't this mean that \nChristianity could and did go in all directions until the canon \nnailed down doctrine? The claim is that our history is distorted \nbecause winners write the history. My reply is that in this case the \nwinners deserved to win, because their faith had a theological \nrootedness that the Gnostics' did not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy tracing second-century theological discussion, we know that a \nconnected use of New Testament books was not yet taking place. Though \nthe individual books were circulating, the only functioning biblical \n\"canon\" was the Old Testament. So how was orthodoxy taught? Did it \neven exist?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe simple answer is that the \"Rule of Faith\" was present. But how \nwas the Rule of Faith passed on from generation to generation? Was \nthere a mechanism that allowed church members to know what orthodoxy \nwas? The answer is yes. It can be detected within our oldest \nhistorical sources for Christianity, showing that the roots of our \nfaith's content go back to the earliest days of the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree words summarize that mechanism: schooling, singing, and \nsacraments.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchooling involved doctrinal summaries. Much like memory verses \ntoday, they presented the core of the faith, not with the detail of \nthe creeds that emerged after the Council of Nicaea, but with enough \ncontent to delineate the most central ideas about God, Jesus, and \nforgiveness through Jesus' death. 1 Corinthians 8:4-6, Romans 1:2-4, \nand 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 reveal this early church schooling. Singing \ninvolved hymns. Philippians 2:5-11 and Colossians 1:15-20 show how \nmuch theology was contained in what the earliest church sang. \nSacraments involved the teaching presented at baptism and Communion. \nHere one can think of the words spoken over the Lord's Table (\"On the \nnight he was betrayed Jesus took the bread  This is for you\") or the \npicture of baptism summarized in Romans 6:2-4, which proclaims that \nChrist has put the old life to death and given new life.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is orthodoxy, rooted in the acts of worship that took place each \nweek before the New Testament canon appeared. The church could know \nits roots because the apostolic teaching showed up in worship. As a \nresult, orthodoxy was passed on and Gnostic teaching was exposed as \nlacking the roots that mattered.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarrell L. Bock is research professor of New Testament studies at \nDallas Theological Seminary.\u0014\nCopyright  2007 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.\u0014\n.\u0014\nIssue 96, Fall 2007, Vol. XXVII, No. 4, Page 42\u0014",

They didnt want to be kept waiting, \ndemanding immediate satisfaction.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             After a few days of this the strain began to show on the \nfaces of the\u0014\ntwo young clerks. Their social life suffered. They were exhausted at \nnight . They became irritable with their friends and families.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             One evening, after work, the two dropped by a bar for a \nbeer.

They\u0014\n         just werent cut out for this kind of daily struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The two fell silent for a moment, their eyes wandering \naround the room,\u0014\n         when they happened to see a sign tacked up on the wall \nbehind the bar. The\u0014\n         sign read: Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a tough \nbattle.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             Kindness. Had they tried that? Not really.

The next day they went out to the \ncustomers in\u0014\n         sympathy, friendship and understandingbefore the customers \nwere able to\u0014\n         voice their anger. They kept the initiative. They set the \ntone, and things\u0014\n         that day went pretty well. After work they felt good.

Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air, and \ndecided to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a \ndistant smile caught his eye, the new check-out girl was beautiful. \nShe was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only 22) and he fell in \nlove.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch \nclock to find out her name. She came into the break room, smiled \nsoftly at him, took her card and punched out, then left. He looked at \nher card, BRENDA.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe walked out only to see her start walking up the road. Next day, he \nwaited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride \nhome. He looked harmless enough, and she accepted. When he dropped \nher off, he asked if maybe he could see her again, outside of work. \nShe simply said it wasn't possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe pressed and she explained she had two children and she couldn't \nafford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter. \nReluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following \nSaturday. That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her \ntell him that she was unable to go with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe baby-sitter had called and canceled. To which Kurtis simply said, \n\"Well, let's take the kids with us.\" She tried to explain that taking \nthe children was not an option, but again not taking no for an \nanswer, he pressed. Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her \nchildren. She had an older daughter who was just as cute as a bug, \nKurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair. He \nwas born a paraplegic with Down Syndrome.\u0014\n\u0014\nKurtis asked Brenda, \"I still don't understand why the kids can't \ncome with us?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBrenda was amazed. Most men would run away from a woman with two \nkids, especially if one had disabilities - just like her first \nhusband and father of her children had done. Kurtis was not ordinary \n- - - he had a different mindset.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and \nthe movies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would take care of \nhim. When he needed to use the restroom, he picked him up out of his \nwheelchair, took him and brought him back. The kids loved Kurtis. At \nthe end of the evening, Brenda knew this was the man she was going to \nmarry and spend the rest of her life with.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her \nchildren. Since then they have added two more kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what happened to Kurtis the stock boy and Brenda the check-out \ngirl? Well, Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner now live in Arizona, where he is \ncurrently employed as the quarterback of the National Football League \nArizona Cardinals and has his Cardinals in the hunt for a Super Bowl \nwin. Is this a surprise ending or could you have guessed that he was \nnot an ordinary person.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be noted that he also quarterbacked the Rams in Super Bowl \nXXXVI.\u0014\n\u0014\n(Just 2 years before, he was still working in that grocery store)\u0014",

And when we learn that for a \nhundred-plus years in the early Middle Ages arguments raged over \npictures of Jesus, causing one of the greatest political, cultural \nand religious upheavals in Christian Historywell, we just don't \nunderstand it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it about icons that created such a stir, and what do they \nrepresent to the Orthodox?\u0014\n\u0014\nA little bloody history\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the 700s, icons were a regular feature of Orthodox spiritual life \nall over the Byzantine Empire. And it was about that time that a \nmovement against icons emerged. Iconoclasm (the movement to \"smash \nicons\") started from within the church itself. A few iconoclastic \nbishops in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) believed the Bible, \nparticularly Exodus 20:4, forbade such images:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in \nheaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You \nshall not bow down to them or worship them . \"\u0014\n\u0014\nByzantine Emperor Leo III (reigned 717-741), convinced by such \nreasoning, tried at first to persuade his subjects to abandon icons. \nA dramatic act of nature reinforced his campaign: a violent \nunderwater volcano suddenly erupted in the Aegean Sea; tidal waves \nsurged over land, and a cloud of volcanic ash darkened the sky. The \nentire city of Constantinople was shaken. Leo interpreted it as a \nsign from heaven: the empire was in grave danger of incurring the \ndivine wrath. So he preached a series of sermons against the use of \nicons.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 726 (or 731; the date is uncertain), Leo stepped up the campaign. \nHe ordered his soldiers to go to the palace gate called Chalke and \ndestroy the icon of Christ painted over the entrance archway. When \nthe soldiers began smashing the image, a group of elderly women \nkicked the ladder out from underneath the soldiers' feet. The \nincident triggered riots, and several women became the first martyrs \nto iconoclasm.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most vigorous opponent of icons in the eighth and ninth centuries \nwas Emperor Leo's son and successor, the brilliant Constantine V. \nConstantine was the person most responsible for developing the \narguments used against icons.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 754 he called the Council of Hieria, and the 338 bishops assembled \nfrom throughout the empire, condemned the making and venerating of \nicons. The deck, however, had been stacked: Constantine had guided \ninto the assembly only those bishops who supported his views. \nNonetheless, the bishops declared their assembly the \"Seventh \nEcumenical Council.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the council, a large-scale war broke out against the supporters \nof icons. Monks, icons' staunchest defenders, felt the heat of \npersecution the most. Thousands were exiled, tortured, or martyred. \nIn 766 Constantine paraded a group of monks holding hands with their \nsister nuns (a scandalous display) through the Hippodrome. Between \n762 and 775, countless Christians suffered greatly, and the period \nbecame known as the \"decade of blood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually the tide turned. In 787 Empress Irene (reigned 780-802), a \nstaunch supporter of icon veneration, convened what would later be \nrecognized as the rightful Seventh Ecumenical Council. The council \naffirmed that icons, though they may not be worshiped, may be honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new attack on icons was made under Leo V the Armenian in 815 and \ncontinued until 843, when icons were again reinstated once and for \nall by Empress Theodora on the First Sunday of Lent, a day still \ncelebrated annually as the Feast of the Triumph of Orthodoxy.\u0014\nGod cannot be painted \u0014\n\u0014\nThe iconoclasts vehemently opposed icons for three basic reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tIcons are idols. Emperor Constantine V argued, \"The icon of Christ \nand Christ himself do not differ from each other in essence,\" thus, \n\"[An icon] is identical in essence with that which it portrays.\" \nSince an icon cannot obviously be Christ in the flesh, it must be a \nfalse imagean idol.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Eucharist, iconoclasts further argued, was the only true image of \nChrist since that was the vehicle that contained Christ's real \npresence. \"The bread which we receive,\" Constantine maintained, \"is \nan icon of his body.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as the iconodules (icon supporters) argued, did not the \nIncarnation make a difference in the way Exodus 20:4 applied to \nicons? The iconoclasts declared \"No!\" The command against making \nimages applied equally to Jews and Christians. Furthermore, there \nshould be no portrayals of Mary, the saints, or angels. As the \nCouncil of 754 stated, \"Since the former [an icon of Christ] has been \nabolished, there is no need for the latter either.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tIcons are not supported by church tradition. The iconoclasts \nbacked up their arguments with references from church fathers such as \nOrigen, Eusebius, and Epiphanius of Salamis.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tIcons deny the church's teaching about Christ. Starting with the \nChalcedon Definition (451), iconoclasts maintained that Christ's \ndivine nature cannot be \"circumscribed\" (i.e., captured, limited) in \na portrait. It is impossible to portray true divinity in an icon. Yet \nto say that icons portray only Christ's humanity is to fall into \nanother heresythe belief that Jesus' divine and human natures were \nnot really united but juxtaposed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Word became \"icon\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThree leading iconodule theologians finally united Orthodox opinion \nabout icons: John of Damascus (c. 655-749), Theodore of Studios \n(759-826), and Nicephorus of Constantinople (758-828). Their \nthreefold response went as follows.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the full article, see: World/MyDocuments/Kissers and Smashers\u0014",

The other person who wanted to speak to him \nso late at night was his friend Eduard Thurneysen, who had remained \nfaithful to him over 60 years. They talked about the gloomy world \nsituation. Then Barth said, \"But keep your chin up! Never mind! He \nwill reign!\" (as quoted in Vernard Eller, Christian Anarchy: Jesus' \nPrimacy Over the Powers [Grand Rapids, Mich.: W. B.

    "title": "KEEPER OF THE SPRING",
    "words": "\"The late Peter Marshall used to love to tell the story of The \nKeeper of the Spring, a quiet forest dweller who lived high above an \nAustrian village along the eastern slopes of the Alps.  The old \ngentleman had been hired many years ago by a young town council to \nclear away the debris from the pools of water up in the mountain \ncrevices that fed the lovely stream flowing through their town. With \nfaithful, silent regularity, he patrolled the hills, removed the \nleaves and branches, and wiped away the silt that would otherwise \nchoke and contaminate the fresh flow of water.  By and by, the \nvillage became a popular attraction for vacationers.  Graceful swans \nfloated along the crystal clear stream, the millwheels of various \nbusinesses located near the water turned day and night, farmlands \nwere naturally irrigated, and the view from restaurants was \npicturesque beyond description.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Years passed.  One evening the town council met for its \nsemiannual meeting.  As they reviewed the budget, one man's eye \ncaught the salary figure being paid the obscure keeper of the \nspring.  Said the keeper of the purse, `Who is the old man?  Why do \nwe keep him on year after year?  No one ever sees him.  For all we \nknow the strange ranger of the hills is doing us no good.  He isn't \nnecessary any longer!'  By a unanimous vote, they dispensed with the \nold man's services.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"For several weeks nothing changed.  By early autumn the trees \nbegan to shed their leaves. Small branches snapped off and fell into \nthe pools, hindering the rushing flowing water.  One afternoon \nsomeone noticed a slight yellowish-brown tint in the the stream.  A \ncouple of days later the water was much darker.  Within another week, \na slimy film covered sections of the water along the banks and a foul \nodor was soon detected.  The millwheels moved slower, some finally \nground to a halt.  Swans left, as did the tourists.  Clammy fingers \nof disease and sickness reached deeply into the village.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Quickly, the embarrassed council called a special meeting.  \nRealizing their gross error in judgment, they hired back the old \nkeeper of the spring...and within a few weeks the veritable river of \nlife began to clear up.  The wheels started to turn, and new life \nreturned to the hamlet in the Alps once again.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Fanciful though it may be, the story is more than an idle tale.  \nIt carries with it a vivid, relevant analogy directly related to the \ntimes in which we live.  What the keeper of the springs meant to the \nvillage, Christian servants mean to our world.  The preserving, \ntaste-giving bite of salt mixed with the illuminating, hope-giving \nray of light may seem feeble and needless, but God help any society \nthat attempts to exist without them!  You see, the village without \nthe keeper of the spring is a perfect representation of the world \nsystem without salt and light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Improving Your Serve by Charles Swindoll.

From the East?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"You might say that,\" the little prospector answered.  \"I'm from \nBoston and I'm here prospecting for gold.\"  \"Now tell me something. \nCan you dance?\"  \"No, sir.  I never did learn to dance.\" Well, I'm \ngoing to teach you.  You'll be surprised how quickly you can learn.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n With that, the Texan took out his gun and started shooting at the \nprospector's feet.  Hopping, skipping, jumping, by the time the \nlittle prospector made it to the door he was shaking like a leaf.\u0014\n\u0014\n About an hour later the Texan left the saloon. As soon as he stepped \noutside the door, he heard a click.  He looked around and there, four \nfeet from his head, was the biggest shotgun he had ever seen.\u0014\n And the little prospector said, \"Mr. Texan, have you ever kissed a \nmule?\" \"No,\" said the quick thinking Texan, \"but I've always wanted \nto.\"\u0014",
