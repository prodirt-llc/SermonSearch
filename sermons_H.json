Society \nultimately has to pay for any mistakes --National School Boards \nAssoc.\u0014\n\u0014\n   According to a recent Associated Press release, research conducted \nfor the U.S. Department of Education shows that between 250,000 and \n360,000 children are were taught at home by their parents rather than \nsent to schools during the 1990-91 school year.  Some proponents of \nhome education put the figure at 500,000 or more.  In any case, there \nhas been a dramatic increase in the last few years.  As recently as \nthe late 1970s, only around 10,000 children were being home-educated.\u0014\n   Some teachers' organizations say that it is a very dangerous \ntrend.  The executive director of the National School Boards \nAssociation calls it \"a giant step backward into the 17th century.\"  \nHe expresses concern that many parents are just not qualified to \nteach their children and his organization has lobbied along with the \nNational Education Association for legal restrictions on home \nschooling.  According to Michael Farris of the National Center for \nHome Education, the opponents of home education have not been very \nsuccessful.  In legislative battles in ten different states so far \nthis year, home schooling has won out every time.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Home school families think they are winning in other ways as \nwell.  One nationwide survey of home schoolers reveals that they \nranked at the 80th percentile or better on standardized achievement \ntests.  Other studies have shown that these children tend to be \nwell-adjusted socially and emotionally and have leadership potential.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Home education increasingly popular\" by Mary Esch.

    "words": "\"It is difficult to say to say what harmful effects have followed \n[our] efforts to talk ourselves out of having a moral sense.\"   \n--James Wilson\u0014\n\u0014\n   Geoffrey Canada's unconventional approach to moral education is a \ngood swift karate kick in the pants.   Geoff is president of the \nRheedlen Centers for Children and Families in Harlem.  In exchange \nfor consummate instruction in martial arts skills, Geoff expects \nsomething unusual in return--virtue.  When he doesn't get it, \nretribution is swift.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Student-cum-instructor Alex Echevarria recalls the time when two \nof Canada's young disciples were caught dealing drugs. \"Geoff went to \ntheir houses, stripped them of their belts, and, in front of the rest \nof us, cut the belts in two with scissors.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Why is Canada's approach so controversial? Sociologist James \nWilson, author of The Moral Sense, would say it's because so many \nseeds of amorality were sown in the 1960s that society couldn't bring \nitself to use words like \"right\" and \"wrong.\" In the poorest \nneighborhoods, laws made it increasingly difficult to screen housing \nproject tenants, and police, seen as an \"occupying force,\" were \nremoved from inner-city streets. Welfare rolls soared, and, in the \nname of freedom, a popular culture of intemperance appeared.\u0014\n\u0014\n   A recent census report documenting the skyrocketing rate of \nout-of-wedlock births was greeted with deafening silence from public \nofficials, including a President who ran on a campaign of \"personal \nresponsibility.\"  At the risk of demonstrating the \"stiff, humorless, \nunAmerican propriety that gave morality a bad name,\" perhaps it's \ntime to give those who behave irresponsibly a good swift kick.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"How about a swift kick?\" by Joe Klein.

    "title": "HOW TO RAISE MORAL (AND JEWISH) CHILDREN",
    "words": "\"At the heart and soul of Jewish moral values is the duty to \nremember our obligation to others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Jewish faith puts the onus of moral training where it \nbelongs--on the parent.  \"The Hebrew word for parents is horim, which \nmeans to guide.\"  Parents are expected to pass on to their children \nthe values of Jewish tradition.\u0014\n   Parents exercise a profound influence on their children--for good \nor for ill.  \"Children watch you intently.  Your choices and deeds \nbuild ethical memories within them.\"  These memories later guide a \nchild when he must decide what to do in a given situation.\u0014\n   Parents who say one thing and do another leave their children \nvulnerable, without \"the courage or the incentive to make moral \nchoices later on in life,\" says psychologist Gene Ridberg.\u0014\n   Jewish tradition is rich in object lessons for proper behavior.  \nFor example, the Shabbat challah loaves are covered.  Why?  To save \nthem the embarrassment of being blessed last, after the Shabbat \nwine.  Compassion for a loaf of bread is expected to translate into a \nconcern for the feelings of others.  Parents should be alert to \nteachable moments in which to instill moral values in their children.\u0014\n   Judaism places great emphasis on mitzvot or good deeds.  This \nreinforces in the consciences of Jewish children the importance of \ncompassion. Children are often taught charity at an early age. In one \nfamily, after a surplus of toys and games were received at a birthday \nparty, the celebrant wrapped the duplicates and took them to a \nshelter. This child had learned well how to consider the needs of \nothers and share generously.\u0014\n   Great value is also placed on zeman kevua, or doing good deeds at \nthe right time.  There is a set time to observe Shabbat, to pay a \ncall on the bereaved, to visit the sick, or to pray.  When a family \npractices good deeds together at set times, children acquire a sense \nof responsibility.\u0014\n   Through parental example and the teaching of traditions rich in \nobject lessons, parents can empower their children to live \ncompassionately and confidently.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"How to raise moral (and Jewish) children\" by Helen Belitsky.  \nJewish Family & Life, Spr 1996.

And,\u0014\nthough the commercialism of this Sunday's celebration\u0014\nmay seem pagan to some (a \"Hallmark Holiday\" if there\u0014\never was one: who dares NOT call or send a card to\u0014\nMom?), Mother's Day's roots are actually quite\u0014\nChristian. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the seventeenth century, many English children left\u0014\nhome to become apprentices, often with masters far\u0014\nfrom their homes. But on the fourth Sunday of Lent,\u0014\nchildren were sent home to spend the day with their\u0014\nmothers. The vacation became known as \"Mothering\u0014\nSunday.\" The children often took a fruity \"mothering\u0014\ncake\" back with them (which, because of the Lenten\u0014\nfast, had to keep until Easter). \u0014\n\u0014\nMothering Sunday never really caught on in the New\u0014\nWorld, and as the practice of apprenticeship began to\u0014\ndie out, so did Mothering Sunday. It blended with a\u0014\nmore Continental European celebration of \"Mother\u0014\nChurch.\" A common practice on this day was to visit\u0014\nthe church of one's baptism. Setting aside a special day\u0014\nto honor physical mothers was, for the most part,\u0014\nforgotten. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1872, Julia Ward Howe, who had published her\u0014\n\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" a decade earlier,\u0014\nsuggested a Mother's Day as a kind of protest to the\u0014\nviolence of the Civil War: \"As men have often forsaken\u0014\nthe plow and anvil at the summons of war, let women\u0014\nnow leave all that may be left of home for a great and\u0014\nearnest day of counsel. Let them meet first, as women,\u0014\nto bewail and commemorate the dead.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThough her idea never took flight, another's did. Anna\u0014\nJarvis, from the rail center of Grafton, West Virginia\u0014\n(named for the \"graftin' on\" point for branch rail lines),\u0014\nwanted to arrange a special church service for her\u0014\nmother in 1907. Her mother, who had died two years\u0014\nearlier, had been an important figure at the Andrews\u0014\nMethodist Church, had lost seven of her 11 children,\u0014\nand had given up her dreams of a college education to\u0014\ncare for her aging and ailing husband. The service was\u0014\nso delightful that Anna Jarvis soon wrote letters to\u0014\neveryone she could think of: politicians, newspaper\u0014\neditors, church leaders, etc. She wanted it to be near\u0014\nMemorial Day so families could remember the sacrifices\u0014\nmothers had made for them. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1910, Jarvis's state had officially recognized the\u0014\nholiday. A year later, almost every other state joined the\u0014\ncelebration. In 1914, Woodrow Wilson made it a\u0014\nnational holiday to be celebrated each second Sunday of\u0014\nMay. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt may please some to know that by the late 1920s,\u0014\nJarvis was angry at the commercialization of the\u0014\ncelebration. Already greeting cardcompanies had made\u0014\nit the fourth largest card holiday in the calendar. Jarvis\u0014\nfiled a lawsuit to stop a 1923 Mother's Day festival, and\u0014\nwas later arrested for disturbing the peace when\u0014\nconfronting carnation salespeople. \"I wanted it to be a\u0014\nday of sentiment, not profit!\" she protested. \u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, when Anna Jarvis died at age 82 in 1948, she\u0014\nwas sorry she'd ever started the holiday. And she never\u0014\nbecame a mother herself.\u0014",

    "title": "HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS",
    "words": "Inspiration\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a\u0014\n\"Honk if you love Jesus\" bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly \nsassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir \nperformance followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the \nsticker and put it on my bumper.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoy, am I glad I did! What an uplifting experience followed! \u0014\n\u0014\nI was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in \nthought about the Lord, and how good He is...and I didn't notice that \nthe light had changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't \nhonked, I'd never have noticed!\u0014\n\u0014\nI found that LOTS of people love Jesus! Why, while I was sitting \nthere, the guy behind me started honking like crazy, and then he \nleaned out of his window and screamed, \"For the love of GOD! GO, GO!! \nJesus Christ, GO!!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started \nhonking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and \nsmiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times \nto share in the love!\u0014\n\u0014\nThere must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard \nhim yelling something about a \"sunny beach\"...I saw another guy \nwaving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I asked my teenage son in the back seat what that meant, he said \nthat it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something. Well, \nI've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and \ngave him the good luck sign back. My son burst out laughing...why, \neven HE was enjoying this religious experience!\u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment \nthat they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet \nthey wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I \nnoticed the light had changed, so I waved one more time to my loving \nbrothers and sisters, grinning, and drove on through the \nintersection. I noticed I was the only car that got through the \nintersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad \nthat I had to leave them all after all the love we had shared, so I \nslowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the \nHawaiian good luck sign one more time as I drove away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPraise the Lord for such wonderful folks!!\u0014",

If they recommend \nthat the church board\u0014\nproceed, a resolution is brought to the congregational business \nmeeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey appoint another 8-member review committee.  If their report to \nthe next congregational business meeting supports the changing of a \nlight bulb, the congregation votes in favor and the responsibility to \ncarry out the\u0014\nlight bulb change is passed on to the trustee board, who in turn \nappoint a 7-member committee to find the best price in new light \nbulbs.  Their recommendation of which hardware is the best buy must \nthen be reviewed by the 23-member ethics committee to make certain \nthat this hardware has no connection to Disney. They report back to \nthe trustee board, which then commissions the trustee in charge of \nthe janitor to ask him to make the\u0014\nchange.  By then the janitor discovers that yet another light bulb \nhas burned out.\u0014",

    "words": "After Quasimodo's death, the bishop of the cathedral of\u0014\n Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that\u0014\n a new bellringer was needed. The bishop decided that he would \nconduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to \nbegin the screening process.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nAfter observing several applicants demonstrate their\u0014\n skills, he decided to call it a day when a lone, armless\u0014\n man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the \nbellringers job.\u0014\n\u0014\n The bishop was incredulous. \"You have no arms!\"\u0014\n \"No matter,\" said the man, \"Observe!\"\u0014\n He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a \nbeautiful melody on the carillon.\u0014\n The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he\u0014\n had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nSuddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless\u0014\n man tripped, and plunged headlong out  of the belfry window to his \ndeath in the street below. The stunned bishop rushed to his side.\u0014\n\u0014\n When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen \nfigure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments \nbefore. As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of \nthem asked, \"Bishop, who was this man? \"I don't know his name,\" the \nbishop sadly  replied, \"but his face rings a bell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n (but wait, there's more...)\u0014\n\u0014\n The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his \nheart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist (now \nthere's a trivia question), the bishop continued his interviews for  \nthe bellringer of Notre Dame.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nThe first man to approach him said, \"Your excellency, I am the \nbrother of the poor, armless wretch that fell to his death from this \nvery belfry yesterday. I pray that you honor his life by allowing me \nto replace him in this duty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and as the armless \nman's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, \nhe groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot. Two \nmonks,hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, \nrushed up the stairs to his side. \"What has happened?\" the first \nbreathlessly asked, \"Who is this man?\"\u0014\n \"I don't know his name,\" sighed the distraught bishop, \"but he's a \ndead ringer for his brother.\"\u0014",

    "title": "HOME SCHOOLING",
    "words": "BY DAVE BARRY\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that we parents must encourage our children to become\u0014\neducated, so they can get into a good college that we cannot afford.\u0014\n\u0014\nI try to help my son, Rob, with his schooling, but over the years this\u0014\nhas become more difficult. Back when he was dealing with basic \neducational issues such as why the sky is blue and what a duck says, \nI always knew the correct answers (``It doesn't matter'' and \n``Moo''). But when Rob got into the higher grades, he started dealing \nwith complex concepts such as the``hypotenuse,'' which hadn't been \ninvented yet when I was a student.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo these days I'm useless as an educational resource, except on those\u0014\nrare occasions when Rob is studying a topic I'm familiar with. For \nexample, last year, in history class, he studied The Sixties. That's \nright: The Sixties are now considered a historical period, just like \nthe Roman\u0014\nEmpire, except that as far as modern kids are concerned, The Sixties\u0014\nfeatured stupider haircuts. Because I lived through that era, when Rob\u0014\nasked me about it, I was able to give him helpful information.\u0014\n\u0014\n``What did you do during The Sixties?'' he asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n``None of your business,'' I informed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther than that, my main contribution to his education is to provide\u0014\nencouragement. For example, the other day I asked him if he had any\u0014\nhomework, and he told me he had to read Beowulf.\u0014\n\u0014\n``Yuck!'' I said, encouragingly. I was exposed to Beowulf when I was a\u0014\nstudent. If my memory serves me correctly (and I believe it does,\u0014\nbecause I am copying this directly from the encyclopedia) Beowulf is \nan Old English epic poem concerning a hero who freed the court of the \nDanish king Hrothgar from the ravages of the ogre Grendel and \nGrendel's mother and thus became king of the Geats.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis raises some questions, including: Who are ``the Geats''? And why\u0014\nwould anybody want to be king of them? I mean, the word ``Geat'' \nsounds like an insult, doesn't it? As in: ``Some stupid Geat put \nsalami in the disk drive!''\u0014\n\u0014\n(Let me just state, before I get a bunch of hate mail, that I myself \nam\u0014\ntwo-thirds Geatish.)\u0014\n\u0014\nMy point is that I have never been a huge fan of Beowulf, or epic \npoems\u0014\nin general. ``Epic,'' in my opinion, is a code word that English \nteachers\u0014\nuse for ``boring,'' the same way they use ``satirical'' when they \nmean ``you will not laugh once.'' Nevertheless I stressed to Rob that \nhe should\u0014\nmake this homework his absolute highest priority, allowing nothing to \ncome ahead of it, but that first we would go out for Italian food. I \nlike to\u0014\ndo this with Rob because he always orders pizza, which I am not \nallowed to eat because it contains cholesterol, but it is a \nscientific fact that your body will not absorb cholesterol if you \ntake it from another person's plate.\u0014\n\u0014\nRob drove us to the restaurant. I like to let him drive because it\u0014\nimproves my circulation by causing my heart to beat 175,000 times per\u0014\nminute, although this particular trip was fairly relaxing right up \nuntil\u0014\n\u0014\nRob made the rookie error of actually stopping at a red light, rather\u0014\nthan accelerating through it as is customary in Miami, the result \nbeing that we were rammed by the car behind us. The other driver, as \nrequired by local aw, was uninsured and spoke no English. This gave \nus an educational opportunity to brush up on our Spanish by engaging \nin a dialogue with the other driver, which went like this:\u0014\n\u0014\nUS (pointing at the light): Rojo! (``Red!'')\u0014\n\u0014\nOTHER DRIVER:No! Amarillo! (``No! Yellow!'')\u0014\n\u0014\nUS: Like heck-o! (``We disagree!'')\u0014\n\u0014\nOTHER DRIVER: Que son? Guitos? (``What are you? Geats?'')\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took two hours and two police officers to sort it out, with the\u0014\noutcome being that the other driver received a ticket-o. Fortunately, \nmy car sustained only superficial damage, which I'm sure at today's \nbody-work prices can be repaired for no more than it would cost to \npurchase the entire contents of the Louvre at retail.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of this delay, we were late getting back from the restaurant,\u0014\nbut Rob still would have had time to do his homework, except that -- \nthis is true -- the police had set up roadblocks around our \nneighborhood and\u0014\nwere not letting anybody in. An officer told us there had been several\u0014\nreports of shots fired, and police were going house-to-house with \ndogs. I was concerned about this, but Rob took it well; I think he \nwas hoping that one of the dogs would eat his copy of Beowulf.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police never found the source of the shots (it was probably just\u0014\nsome innocent thing -- perhaps a neighbor who couldn't locate his \nremote control and decided to turn off his TV with his AK-47). But we \nhad to wait at the roadblock for over an hour, which meant that Rob \ndid not start reading Beowulf until after midnight. So basically, \nthis entire column is really just a note to his English teacher to \nsay: Please excuse Rob if he was unprepared. And I hope you were not \noffended by my tone. It's satirical.\u0014",

An average Catholic (or Orthodox or Coptic \nor Anglican or Methodist\u0014\n                       or Presbyterian or whatever) doesn't bother to \nread the sign but he'll stop\u0014\n                       the car if the car in front of him does. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       5. A fundamentalist, taking the text very \nliterally, stops at the stop sign and\u0014\n                       waits for it to tell him to go. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       6. A seminary educated evangelical preacher \nmight look up \"STOP\" in his\u0014\n                       lexicons of English and discover that it can \nmean: 1) something which\u0014\n                       prevents motion, such as a plug for a drain, \nor a block of wood that\u0014\n                       prevents a door from closing; 2)a location \nwhere a train or bus lets off\u0014\n                       passengers. The main point of his sermon the \nfollowing Sunday on this text\u0014\n                       is: when you see a stop sign, it is a place \nwhere traffic is naturally clogged,\u0014\n                       so it is a good place to let off passengers \nfrom your car. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       7. An orthodox Jew does one of two things: a) \nTake another route to work\u0014\n                       that doesn't have a stop sign so that he \ndoesn't run the risk of disobeying the\u0014\n                       Law; b) Stop at the sign, say \"Blessed art \nthou, O Lord our God, king of\u0014\n                       the universe, who hast given us thy \ncommandment to stop,\" wait 3 seconds\u0014\n                       according to his watch, and then proceed. \nIncidentally, the Talmud has the\u0014\n                       following comments on this passage: Rabbi Meir \nsays: He who does not\u0014\n                       stop shall not live long. R. Hillel says: \nCursed is he who does not count to\u0014\n                       three before proceeding. R. Simon ben Yudah \nsays: Why three? Because\u0014\n                       the Holy One, blessed be He, gave us the Law, \nthe Prophets, and the\u0014\n                       Writings. R. ben Isaac says: Because of the \nthree patriarchs. R. Yehuda\u0014\n                       says: Why bless the Lord at a stop sign? \nBecause it says, \"Be still and know\u0014\n                       that I am God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       8. A scholar from the Jesus Seminar concludes \nthat the passage \"STOP\"\u0014\n                       undoubtedly was never uttered by Jesus himself \nbecause being the\u0014\n                       progressive Jew that he was, He would never \nhave wanted to stifle peoples\u0014\n                       progress. Therefore, STOP must be a textual \ninsertion belonging entirely to\u0014\n                       stage III of the gospel tradition, when the \nchurch was first confronted by\u0014\n                       traffic in its parking lot. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       9. A NT (New Testament) scholar notices that \nthere is no stop sign on\u0014\n                       Mark street but there is one on Matthew and \nLuke streets, and concludes\u0014\n                       that the ones on Luke and Matthew streets are \nboth copied from a sign on a\u0014\n                       street no one has ever seen called \"Q\" street. \nThere is an excellent 300 page\u0014\n                       doctoral dissertation on the origin of these \nstop signs, and the differences\u0014\n                       between stop signs on Matthew and Luke street \nin the scholar's\u0014\n                       commentary on the passage. There is an \nunfortunate omission in the\u0014\n                       dissertation, however; it doesn't explain the \nmeaning of the text! \u0014\n\u0014\n                       10. An OT (Old Testament) scholar points out \nthat there are a number of\u0014\n                       stylistic differences between the first and \nsecond half of the passage\u0014\n                       \"STOP.\" For example, \"ST\" contains no enclosed \nareas and five line\u0014\n                       endings, whereas \"OP\" contains two enclosed \nareas and only one line\u0014\n                       termination. He concludes that the author for \nthe second part is different\u0014\n                       from the author on the first part and probably \nlived hundreds of years later.\u0014\n                       Later scholars determine that the second half \nis itself actually written by two\u0014\n                       separate authors because of similar stylistic \ndifferences between the \"O\" and\u0014\n                       the \"P. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       11. Another prominent OT scholar notes in his \ncommentary that the stop\u0014\n                       sign would fit better into the context three \nstreets back.(Unfortunately, he\u0014\n                       neglected to explain why in his commentary.) \nClearly it was moved to its\u0014\n                       present location by a later redactor. He thus \nexegetes the intersection as\u0014\n                       though the sign were not there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       12. Because of the difficulties in \ninterpretation, another OT scholar amends\u0014\n                       the text, changing the \"T\" to \"H\". \"SHOP\" is \nmuch easier to understand in\u0014\n                       context than \"STOP\" because of the \nmultiplicity of stores in the area. The\u0014\n                       textual corruption probably occurred because \n\"SHOP\" is so similar to\u0014\n                       \"STOP\" on the sign several streets back, that \nit is a natural mistake for a\u0014\n                       scribe to make. Thus the sign should be \ninterpreted to announce the\u0014\n                       existence of a shopping area. If this is true, \nit could indicate that both\u0014\n                       meanings are valid, thus making the thrust of \nthe message \"STOP (AND)\u0014\n                       SHOP.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       13. A \"prophetic\" preacher notices that the \nsquare root of the sum of the\u0014\n                       numeric representations of the letters S-T-O-P \n(sigma-tau-omicron-pi in the\u0014\n                       Greek alphabet), multiplied by 40 (the number \nof testing), and divided by\u0014\n                       four (the number of the world-north, south, \neast, and west) equals 666.\u0014\n                       Therefore, he concludes that stop signs are \nthe dreaded \"mark of the beast,\"\u0014\n                       a harbinger of divine judgment upon the world, \nand must be avoided at all\u0014\n                       costs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       not original -- source unknown HW in HI\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO KILL A CHURCH",
    "words": "\"He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at\u0014\ntheir stubborn hearts, and said to the man, 'Stretch out\u0014\nyour hand.' He stretched it out, and his hand was completely\u0014\nrestored.\" -- Jesus (Mark 3:5, NIV)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent times I have watched a once thriving church die\u0014\nalmost overnight. The times changed. The people's needs\u0014\nchanged. . .but most of the members refused to change. They\u0014\njust kept doing more of the same in a vain attempt to revive\u0014\ntheir church's dying soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople fought over the dumbest things. Some didn't like the\u0014\nchanges in the music. Some didn't like people clapping. Some\u0014\ndidn't like the changes in the manner of worship. Every\u0014\nattempted change was thwarted and the church died.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnconsciously, these people chose to die rather than change.\u0014\nIt's easy to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's the same in the work-a-day-world. If we don't keep up\u0014\nwith the changing times and keep upgrading our training,\u0014\nmany of us will get left behind too.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how do we avoid the death of a ministry? One vital way is\u0014\nby making sure we are people centered rather than program\u0014\ncentered. While the old-fashioned gospel message never\u0014\nchanges, our methods of communicating and applying it need\u0014\nto keep changing according to the changing needs of the\u0014\npeople to whom we are seeking to minister.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus always ministered to people according to where they\u0014\nwere at in terms of their felt or perceived need -- and not\u0014\nout of his own need or pre-packaged program. The blind man\u0014\nhad a physical need so Jesus met him at this point of need.\u0014\nThe man with the withered hand also needed a physical touch\u0014\nso that's what Jesus gave him. The woman at the well was a\u0014\nsocial outcast so Jesus made her feel welcome. Zacchaeus,\u0014\nthe despised tax gatherer, needed a friend so Jesus went\u0014\nhome with him. Jesus always understood people and the needs\u0014\nand things they were struggling with -- and that's exactly\u0014\nwhere he met them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis approach was, \"What do you want me to do for you? Do you\u0014\nwant to be made well/whole?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need to do the same lest we become like the Pharisees who\u0014\nloved their rules, their teachings and their programs more\u0014\nthan they loved people and more than they loved God. When\u0014\nthe religious leaders were mad at Jesus because he healed\u0014\nthe man with the withered hand on their \"holy religious day\"\u0014\n(the Sabbath) and wanted to have him destroyed, Jesus looked\u0014\non them in anger because of their stubborn hearts--hearts\u0014\nthat didn't care about the man's need. They just cared about\u0014\ntheir stupid rules and religious rituals.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Suggested prayer: \"Dear God, how easy it is to become\u0014\nreligious and not care about relationships, to follow rigid\u0014\nrules and not the leading of your Spirit, to be cursed with\u0014\nthe affliction to give advice, and to preach at people\u0014\nwithout bothering to understand where they are coming from\u0014\nand what their real needs are. Please deliver me from this\u0014\nfolly and give me an understanding heart, a compassionate\u0014\nnature, and a willingness to meet people at their point of\u0014\nfelt need. In other words, help me to be like Jesus.\u0014\nGratefully in his name. Amen.\"\u0014",

Unfortunately, the Nova did not \u0014\nsell well in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Additional \u0014\nads were ordered, marketing efforts were stepped up, but sales \u0014\nremained stagnant. Sales directors were baffled. The car had sold \u0014\nwell in the American market; why wasn't it selling now? When they \u0014\ndiscovered the answer, it was rather embarrassing: In Spanish, Nova \u0014\nmeans \"no go.\" The business world is full of such stories. For \u0014\nexample, when Perdue Farms, Inc., converted its popular slogan \"It \u0014\ntakes a tough man to make a tender chicken,\" into Spanish in hopes \u0014\nof expanding its chicken business, the results were less than \u0014\ndesirable. Why? The translation was \"It takes a virile man to make \u0014\na chicken affectionate.\" Not exactly what Frank Perdue had in mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament Model for evangelism is the communication of the \u0014\nChristian faith through contextualization, which simply means that \u0014\nthe message of the Christian faith is to be presented in a way that \u0014\nmakes sense to the person hearing it. Think of the evangelistic \u0014\nefforts of Jesus. When he encountered the woman at the well, he \u0014\nbegan is conversation with the topic of water.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he encountered the fisherman Peter, his starting point was \nfishing. \u0014\nWhen the tax collector invited Jesus to his house, the issue of \u0014\nmoney opened the dialogue. Jesus clearly developed his presentation \u0014\nof God's saving message in light of the context and background of \u0014\nhis listeners. The apostle Paul shared Christ's commitment to this \u0014\napproach, writing that he became \" all things to all men so that by \u0014\nall possible means [he] might save some\" (1 Cor. 9.22).\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Emery White, \"Rethinking The Church,\" Baker, 1998, p. 38.\u0014\n________________________\u0014",

    "words": "Hindu Extremism On The Rise In India \u0014\n\u0014\nNEW DELHI, India (CNS) -- Hindu fundamentalist groups in India are \ntrying to curb the activities of other religious groups and control \nthe \"expressions\" of those not conforming to their world view, \naccording to analysts here. As examples, analysts point to Hindu \nattempts to change the Indian constitution in ways that would curb \nartistic free expression and restrict the right of minority \nChristians and Muslims to preach and practice their religion freely. \u0014\n\"Increasing intolerance among the Hindu fundamentalist organizations, \nwhich pose a grave threat to democracy, are an indication of the rise \nof fascist forces in India,\" said politics professor M. Mohanty of \nDelhi University. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What happened with European fascism is now happening with the \nHindus,\" he told CNSNews.com. Kanti Bajpai, professor of \ninternational politics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, agreed, \ntelling CNSNews.com that \"the rise of right-wing politics in India is \nfar more advanced and violent than in Austria.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 80 percent of India's nearly one billion people are Hindus. \nMuslims form a sizeable minority of around 15 percent, while just 2.5 \npercent are Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Hindu fundamentalist leaders have formally denied \nresponsibility for attacks on minority religious communities, their \npropaganda is characterized by threats of violence. \u0014\nIn Orissa, where Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two \nsons were murdered 13 months ago, the local government passed an \norder last November prohibiting religious conversions without the \nprior permission of the local police and a district magistrate. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe order, an amendment to the 1967 Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, \nstipulates that a citizen wishing to convert must undergo a police \ninquiry to explain his or her reasons. \u0014\nIndia's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has passed a bill \nrestricting the building and use of places of worship. It is awaiting \nthe approval of the Indian president. The western state of Gujarat \nrecently lifted a ban on government employees being members of the \nHindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (national self-service \norganization, or RSS). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe RSS, which claims to be a socio-cultural organization, is the \nmain think tank of several fundamentalist bodies in India, including \nthe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The RSS functions as the \nprincipal guardian of Hindu ideology. An RRS member assassinated \nMahatma Gandhi in 1948. It has been banned three times since \nindependence for its activities. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlso in Gujarat, lawmakers soon will debate a draft Freedom of \nReligion Bill, which makes it a criminal offense to use force or \nfraud in converting a person from one religion to another. \u0014\nHindu fundamentalists forced an Indo-Canadian movie director, Deepa \nMehta, from filming a movie that reportedly depicted an upper caste \nHindu widow falling in love with a lower caste laborer as well as \nwidows being forced into prostitution by those in the upper castes. \u0014\nTaking exception to the storyline of \"Water,\" activists said it \n\"tarnished the image of the country and Hindus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nActress Nandita Das, who stars in \"Water,\" said the fanatics were \nmisleading people and causing trouble for the whole society \"in a \ncountry known for its unity in diversity.\" \u0014\nPolitical scientist Mohanty warned that the greatest danger to \nIndia's \"extremely strained social fabric\" may come not from Sikh or \nMuslim separatists, but from Hindu fundamentalists. \u0014\nThe vice-president of the ruling BJP, J.P. Mathur, said Hindus were \nknown for their tolerance, but that \"Muslim fundamentalism has now \nforced us to raise our head and counter it. It is all because of the \nsurvival of the fittest.\" India has a long history of violence \nbetween the Hindu majority and Muslims. Recently, Christians also \nhave been targeted. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Delhi-based United Christian Forum for Human Rights has \ndocumented more than 120 attacks against Christian individuals, \nchurches, and schools, allegedly by Hindu fundamentalists, in the \npast year. Half of the incidents have occurred in Gujarat. \u0014\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Delhi, Alan de Lastic, said \nextremists were employing a national-level strategy to try to stem \nthe influence of Christians. \"It is more pronounced in states\u0014",

    "words": "Hinduism \u0014\n\u0014\nHinduism is the religion of India and Hinduism is not a religion \u0014\nwith a single god. They find the concept of one God too restrictive \u0014\nso their land is peppered with more than 300,000 local deities. \u0014\nBut, Hinduism has some universal qualities which all Hindus share \u0014\nin common. Their deities offer to everyone, through rigorous \u0014\nspiritual practice, the chance to realize god-consciousness. \u0014\nIt is to the land of India that the teenage Jesus is said to have \u0014\ncome in order to get in touch with his god-consciousness. The folk \u0014\nstory goes, and it is a strong tradition in the culture, that Jesus \u0014\nslipped away from his parents, journeyed across Southeast Asia \u0014\nlearning yoga meditation, and then returned home to Israel to \u0014\nbecome a guru to the Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most famous of modern Hindus, Gandhi, was drawn to Jesus' \u0014\nvirtues of compassion and nonviolence. But this is about as far as \u0014\nHindus go in revering Jesus. Jesus is nothing more than, as we have \u0014\nsaid, a guru--a guide to self realization. All of us, like Jesus, \u0014\nhave the potential to discover our own inherent divinity. In fact, \u0014\nyou can call it whatever you wish: Your Christ-consciousness, god-\u0014\nconsciousness, Krishna-consciousness, or Buddha-consciousness--it's \u0014\nall the same thing. The Hindus follow this to a natural conclusion: \u0014\nThe Hindu would not say that the supreme commandment is \"love they \u0014\nneighbor;\" the Hindu would insist that in reality you and I are the \u0014\nsame beings. After all, if we all are inherently divine, and just \u0014\nhaven't discovered it yet, then we are all in essence one and the \u0014\nsame being. That is why Hindus make much of the statement uttered \u0014\nby Jesus, \"The Father and I are one.\"\u0014",

    "words": "How God Won When \nPolitics Failed \u0014\n                         Learning from the abolitionists during a \ntime of political discouragement. \u0014\nBy Tim Stafford\u0014\n\u0014\n Facing another election year, American Christians are bound to feel \ndepleted. When Jimmy Carter, a born-again, Sunday-school-teaching \nBaptist, was elected President, many people thought his Christian \nsincerity would inevitably make a moral impact. When the Moral \nMajority was founded in 1979, change seemed relatively simple--just \nget the great silent majority organized. When the conservative \nCongress of 1994 swept into office, backed by an enthusiastic corps \nof Christian activists, many thought the real revolution had begun. \nNow Christian activists are debating the viability of the Religious \nRight, with former heavyweight activist Paul Weyrich writing that \n\"politics itself has failed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow we know: Christian influence is not going to be easy. Will we \never see the end of hundreds of thousands of abortions? Will we ever \nsee marriage and sexual fidelity restored to honor? Will \nentertainment ever again be decent? Will gambling ever be pushed back \ninto the shadows? The uncertainty is discouraging. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, this is not the first time American Christians have been \ndiscouraged in trying to usher in a moral agenda through politics. \nOur forebears have much to teach us. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Vocal Moral Minority\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past several years, in doing research for a novel, I have \nlived mentally in an America before the automobile, before the \nelectric light, before modern instruments of communication. Yet I \nhave heard the same sighs of exasperation and discouragement from \nChristian activists as we hear today. These were the men and women \nwho set out to oppose slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the issues they confronted have eerie parallels in our own \nday. The political establishment charged that their moralistic \ncrusade against slavery stirred up hatred and violence. (Slaveholders \nclaimed that abolitionism, not slavery, caused Nat Turner to lead his \nbloody slave rebellion.) The two political parties (Whig and \nDemocratic) contended that they could not take a stand on slavery--or \neven discuss it--because they must remain a \"big tent\" to include \npeople of different persuasions. For about 30 years, from 1830 to the \nbeginning of the Civil War, abolitionists gave their lives to a cause \nthat saw no visible success. True, anti-slavery sentiment grew from a \ntiny splinter of opinion to a vague and uncommitted majority opinion \nin the North, but not one slave was freed by law, and slaveholders \ngrew harder, if anything, in their resistance. As a result, \nabolitionists were often discouraged, and some lost faith in the \nmovement and in God. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The great body of Abolitionists seem to be mere passengers on a \npleasure sail,\" staunch abolitionist Theodore Weld complained to his \nfriend Gerrit Smith in 1839. Another friend, Charles Stuart, wrote to \nWeld in 1843, \"The Anti Slavery heart of the nation wants re-rousing, \nand we can obtain no adequate means of re-rousing it. . . . So that I \nshould despair were it not that The Lord reigns and bids the Earth \nrejoice.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually Weld gave up the cause, having decided that he had tried \nto change hearts in the wrong way and must simply tend to his own. He \nhad been \"the most mobbed man in America,\" a fearless, charismatic \nspeaker who converted whole towns to the anti-slavery cause despite \nviolent resistance. For a generation of abolitionists he was the \nmodel of Christian commitment, but businessman and abolitionist \nleader Lewis Tappan wrote sarcastically to poet-activist John \nGreenleaf Whittier in 1847, \"Where is Weld? He is in a ditch \nopposite his house, doing the work any Irishman could do for 75 cents \na day.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNear the heart of their discouragement was the insight that slavery \nis sin: not merely an unfortunate institutional arrangement, but an \nact of prideful rebellion against God. An Americans natural \npredisposition, on seeing a sinful institution, is to try to outlaw \nit. The abolitionists saw, however, that this would not be enough. \nSin corrupts the heart, and how could they affect slaveholder hearts \nby changing the law? Supposing they were able to make slavery \nillegal. Would that change the stain of racism and pride? So, in the \nbeginning, abolitionists abjured politics. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbolitionists set out to convince slaveholders to repent of their \nsin. They did so first by mailing publications to prominent citizens \nin the South. Soon they discovered that Southerners were not only \nunready to repent, but would not even tolerate the voice of the \npreacher. Abolitionist pamphlets were collected at Southern post \noffices and burned, their authors hung in effigy. Southern newspapers \nadvertised large rewards for the lives of William Lloyd Garrison or \nArthur Tappan. (Tappan, in perhaps his only recorded attempt at \nhumor, was supposed to have said regarding the $100,000 offered for \nhim, \"If that sum is placed in a New York bank, I may possibly think \nof giving myself up.\") \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not just the South that refused to listen. Even in the North, \nabolitionist opinions were regarded as inflammatory and dangerous: \n1834 saw three days of rioting in Manhattan in which churches with \nanti-slavery sympathies were trashed, homes were wrecked or burned, \nand the Tappan Brothers store, one of the most prominent in New York, \ncame within an eyelash of being destroyed while the police stood by. \nIn Boston a mob led Garrison through the streets with a rope around \nhis neck. The police rescued him by putting him in jail. In \nCincinnati, James Birneys printing press was dragged through the \nstreets and thrown in the river; he hid for days to escape violence. \nIn Alton, Illinois, editor Elijah Lovejoy defended his press from \nsimilar mobs and was shot and killed. In hundreds, perhaps thousands \nof towns, abolitionists who tried to give lectures were stoned, \nbeaten, tarred and feathered, or at least physically threatened. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo say the least, abolitionists nave expectation that their simple \nreligious logic would win a quick response proved badly mistaken. \nNaturally this was discouraging, most of all because it revealed so \nmuch about their fellow citizens. There was no \"moral majority.\" The \ncharacter of America was determinedly racist; appeals to moral \nconscience were not only not heeded, but violently resisted. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Failure of Churches\u0014\n\u0014\nA parallel attempt at persuasion occurred in denominations. \nAbolitionists thought they could use church machinery to catch \nslaveholding consciences. For example, if the Presbyterian General \nAssembly would recognize slavery as sin, then any slaveholding \nPresbyterian would be refused communion until he freed his slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut here, too, obduracy was stronger than abolitionists expected. The \nmajor denominations were willing to split North and South--and \ndid--rather than yield on the question of slavery. The only legacy of \nabolitionist argument seemed to be rancor, bitterness, and division. \u0014\nAbolitionists were left disillusioned about the character of their \nfellow Christians and the churches they shared. Garrison and his \nBoston followers, along with other separatistic \"come-outer\" \nbelievers, completely left organized religion during this phase. The \nrank and file continued in church but were discouraged. They no \nlonger believed that a simple appeal to right would win the hearts of \ntheir fellow Americans--or even of the broad range of their fellow \nChristians. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf straightforward moral appeals will not work, what next? The bitter \n1840 split that all but destroyed the American Anti-Slavery Society \nwas ostensibly about whether women could serve as society officers. \nThe question of politics lay underneath, however. Garrison had grown \nmore convinced that politics, whether in church or society, could \nnever do good. The system was evil, so that even to vote, he famously \ndeclared, was \"sin for me.\" He dramatized this conviction one Fourth \nof July by publicly burning the Constitution. Rather than engage in \npolitics, he chose to provide a noisy moral conscience to a sinful \nnation. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost abolitionists were not so pure. Many were loyal Whigs or \nDemocrats, still seeing their parties hopefully. They had always \nvoted, and continued to vote, trying to find candidates who would \nsupport their positions. It became common to question candidates \nregarding their positions on slavery, and to publish the results as a \nkind of forerunner of voters guides. \u0014\nMany abolitionists hung between politics and prophetic morality. And \nmany grew disillusioned by the rank politics and evident racism of \nthe major parties. Thus the Liberty Party was born, running former \nslaveholder James Birney for President in 1840 and 1844. The Liberty \nParty confined its concerns to slavery. Electorally its fate was that \nof all single-issue parties in American history: Birney received a \nnegligible number of votes. His only impact was to split the Whig \nvote in New York and elect slaveholder James Polk to the presidency, \nensuring the annexation of Texas as a slave state. This was hardly a \nreason for most abolitionists to rejoice in politics. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet they did not give up on politics. The Liberty Party--most of it, \nanyway--merged with disgruntled Democrats and Whigs to form the Free \nSoil Party in 1848. This represented a classic case of political \ncoalition-building. Abolitionists--many of whom considered themselves \nmore politically shrewd than they really were--joined a party that \ncontained some frankly racist members, on the belief that they could \nmanipulate it toward their own ends. They even accepted Martin Van \nBuren as their presidential candidate, though he was the very man \nwho, as President, had tried to send the Amistad slaves back into \ncaptivity. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Looks Like Failure\u0014\n\u0014\nThe abolitionists experiment in politics failed on two counts. They \nfound that their real influence in the party was \nnegligible--politicians promised them vague blessings in exchange for \ntheir support but gave them nothing concrete. More importantly, the \nFree Soil Party with its watered-down commitments still won \npractically nothing on the national scene. They had compromised for \nthe promise of politics, but gained the wind. \u0014\nNo wonder, then, that the rise of the Republican Party from the ashes \nof Free Soil won little interest from abolitionists, or that the \nnomination of Abraham Lincoln by that party in 1860 was treated with \nscorn by most abolitionists. Lincoln was a frank moral compromiser. \nHe was willing to preserve slavery, only opposing its extension into \nthe rest of the nation. His party included many candid racists. \nThough many rank-and-file abolitionists voted for him, no doubt, they \ndid so without enthusiasm. Few recognized the man they would come to \nregard with such reverence. \u0014\n\u0014\nAltogether the abolitionists appeared to be failures. Whether they \npursued the pure morality of moral appeal, the modified purity of \nsingle-issue politics, or the compromising politics of coalitions and \ndeals, they accomplished nothing visible except increasing rancor. \nThey were blamed for the violence in Kansas, for the bloodshed over \nfugitive slaves, for the bitter feelings of the South, for the \nextremism that led to John Browns raid on Harpers Ferry--and with \nsome justice. To preach against sin without success is to harden \nconsciences and to create almost intolerable frustration. \u0014\n\u0014\nLongtime abolitionist Gerrit Smith expressed this despair in 1855 \nwhen he concluded that \"the movement to abolish American slavery is a \nfailure.\" He saw this as a tragedy not only for slaves but for all \nAmerica. \"American slavery has left scarcely one sound spot in \nAmerican character; and it is, confessedly, the ruler of America.\" He \nhad lost all hope for moral change. \"It is but too probable,\" he \npredicted, \"that American slavery will have expired in blood before \nthe men shall have arisen who are capable of bringing it to a \nvoluntary termination.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was right, of course: slavery ended through the worst bloodshed \nAmerica has ever known. It represented a complete failure for \nAmerica. Unable to find a political or moral solution to its most \nvexing issue, the nation divided and fought to kill. And yet it would \nbe wrong to agree with Smith that \"the movement to abolish American \nslavery is a failure.\" For American slavery was abolished, and the \nabolitionists, who created the moral consciousness that led to a war, \nwere very much responsible. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore they began their work, there was only the mildest, sleepiest \nreaction against slavery in America. When they were done, millions of \nAmericans stood against slavery. Change did not come as the \nabolitionists had hoped. It did not come as anyone had hoped. But it \ndid come, and few would claim today that it was not change for the \ngood, however bitter the circumstances. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Plans of the Almighty\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the theologians who commented on this contemporaneously, \nAbraham Lincoln thought deepest and spoke most wisely. His Second \nInaugural Address can be read as a commentary on the limits of \npolitics, and on the deeper purposes that work beneath the surface \nstrivings of politicians and activists and even those who pray. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe address begins with an utterly confounding pronouncement: No \npredictions about the future will be made, Lincoln says--a remarkable \nstatement for a politician in power, whose armies at last seem to \nhave swung the war in their direction. Indeed, Lincoln suggests, \nhuman plans have been confounded by the course of the war. Both \nsides, he notes, dreaded war and sought to avert it. Lincoln puts the \nresult of their attempts in the cadence of a muffled drumbeat: \"And \nthe war came.\" The war came, unimpeded by the plans of both sides. \u0014\n\u0014\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration \nwhich it has already attained. . . . Each looked for an easier \ntriumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the \nsame Bible, and pray to the same God. . . . The prayers of both could \nnot be answered--that of neither has been answered fully. The \nAlmighty has his own purposes. Having established the futility of \nhuman planning, Lincoln probes the Almightys \"own purposes\": \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses \nwhich, in the providence of God . . . he now wills to remove, and \nthat he gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe \ndue to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any \ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a \nliving God always ascribe to him? Fondly do we hope--fervently do we \npray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if \nGod wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the \nbondsmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be \nsunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid \nby another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years \nago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true \nand righteous altogether.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln is reminding America that human effort is puny; and that God \nhas his own purposes which rule the universe in ways we would not \nchoose. Only having placed our actions in that grand context of \ndivine justice does Lincoln conclude, in a single long, winding \nsentence, that we should \"strive to finish the work we are in . . . \nwith firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLincolns consciousness, I would say, ought to help us deal with \ndiscouragement. He would remind us that we must \"strive to finish the \nwork we are in,\" but we cannot afford to place too much trust in that \nwork. We should work \"with firmness in the right, as God gives us to \nsee the right.\" We should agitate, and argue, and pray for a result \nwe believe in--even as we know others hold opposite convictions with \nequal fervency. Yet God may work something more fundamental and \nastounding than anything we could guess. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe abolitionists, we see with hindsight, played a potent role in \narousing the moral consciousness of the North regarding slavery. They \nfailed at all their goals, and they failed even to arouse a majority \nto their point of view. They did, however, plant deeply the seed of \nrevulsion for slavery and love for brothers and sisters of another \ncolor. They never expected that this seed would grow in a young \nmother, daughter of a famous clergyman, who would write it in a novel \ncalled Uncle Toms Cabin. The abolitionists did not generally read \nnovels, which they considered to border on the immoral. Still, \nHarriet Beecher Stowes novel, sentimental as it was, stirred up the \nNorth to make white people feel that black people had human feelings. \nFew if any books have had the same effect on a nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe abolitionists experience should teach us not to be discouraged, \nbut not for any obvious reason. We cannot know whether we will \nultimately succeed, and our trust ought not to rest in our plans and \nhopes. Rather we trust and hope in Almighty God, who rules our plans \nand makes of them results more fundamental and astounding than \nanything we can dream. His judgments, and his only, are \"true and \nrighteous altogether.\" Toward this trust, and this only, our \ndiscouragement should lead us.\u0014\n\u0014\nTim Stafford is Senior Writer for Christianity Today.\u0014",

My younger sister \nsuggested a scrapbook filled with memories. Each sibling (there are \neight of us) was given three pages to fill with anything we chose. \nTry as I might, I could think of nothing to put on my pages. I \nfinally wrote them this letter, which I hope you will print for all \n~those who have parents they love and cherish:\u0014\n\u0014\nTo My Parents on Their 60th Anniversary:\u0014\n\u0014\n How do I say thank you for all the love and caring over the years? \nHow do I repay all the nights you stayed up when I was sick, and all \nthe floors you walked when I was late coming home? What can I give \nyou far all the times you supported me in my triumphs, and provided a \nshoulder when there were losses? What present is there for all the' \nElites we just sat together and shared our warmth? How do I thank you \nfor the guidance when I was unsure of my way, and your restraint to \nallow me to find it myself? You nurtured my growth, yet allowed me my \nindependence. How can I measure the worth of your love? What gift is \nenough?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer came to me today. No box can hold it, no wrapping can \ncover it, nor can a ribbon tie it. No store had it on a shelf. My \ngift is not to you, it is to my children. I promise to care for them \nwhen they are sick, and walk the floors when they are late. I will \nshare with them their victories, and comfort them when there are \nlosses. I will help them to grow, yet let them choose their own path. \nI'll be there when they need me and step aside when they must go \nalone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd someday, maybe, they will come to me and say, How can we thank \nyou for all you have done for us? And I will tell them, Don't thank \nme. Thank my parents. For I am the product of their love, and you are \nmy  gift to them.  CHRIS IN ABILENE, TEXAS\u0014",

    "words": "Hate on the Internet: A \nhuge and growing threat.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE MOST ACTIVE NEO-NAZI GROUP IN AMERICA\u0014\n\u0014\nThe National Alliance (NA) was originally established as the 'Youth \nfor Wallace campaign in support of the failed 1968 Presidential bid \nof Alabama Governor George Wallace. After Wallace lost, the group was \nrenamed the National Youth Alliance. In 1970, William Pierce, a \nformer American Nazi Party official, joined the group, and in 1974 \n(around the time that David Duke founded his Knights of the Ku Klux \nKlan), Pierce took the reins and dropped the word 'Youth from the \norganization's name.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow in his mid-60s, Pierce still leads the group out of a compound in \nWest Virginia. Using the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, he authored the \nnovel The Turner Diaries, which details a successfiil world \nrevolution by an all-white army, and the systematic extennination of \nBlacks, Jews, and other minorities. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany extremists regard The Turner Diaries as an explicit terrorism \nmanual, and the novel is believed to have inspired several major acts \nof violence, including the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Pierce \ncontinues to encourage violence, viewing it as the ultimate solution \nto what he terms the Jewish problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe National Alliance is currently the largest and most active \nneo-Nazi organization in the nation. In the past several years, \ndozens of violent crimes, induding murders, bombings and robberies, \nhave been traced to NA members or appear to have been inspired by\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hate we see on the Internet today is more pervasive, more \nvfrulent, more insidious and more threatening than anything \nextremists of past decades could have imaglned~\u0014\n\u0014\nthe group's propaganda. At the same time, the organization's \nmembership base has experienced major growth, with its numbers more \nthan doubling since 1992.\u0014\nThe NA's current strength can\u0014\nbe attributed to several factors, but in particular a skillful \nembrace of the Internet.\u0014\nA former physics professor at Oregon State University, Pierce was \nquick to understand the potential power of the Internet. Today, the \nNAs site is one of the best-organized and most informative hate sites \non the Web. It promotes Pierce's Nazi-like ideology:\u0014\nbiological determinism, hierarchical organization, an emphasis on \nwill and sacrifice, and a long-term eugenics program involving at \nleast the entire populations of Europe and America.\u0014\nIncluded on the NA's site are Pierce's anti-Semitic screed Who Rules \nAmerica (a particular favorite among online bigots) and articles \nfrom the NA's print publications, Free Speech and National Vanguard. \nThese documents contain familiar themes:\u0014\nAmerica is in decline, its vital essence polluted by non-Aryans, and \nonly the revolutionary program of the NA can save it.\u0014\nHate of non-whites runs through these pieces, but an extra dose of \nvenom is reserved for Jews, who are cast as the source of all evil, \ndriven by biological necessity to destroy Aryan society. Even when \none of Pierce's articles blames America's presumed decline on the \ninflux of non-Europeans, Jews are portrayed as the force responsible \nfor this by spreading that most noxious of all ideas, equality.\u0014\nThe National Alliance\u0014",

    "title": "HOOKED ON CRACK COCAINE",
    "words": "Hooked On Crack\u0014\nWhat would it take to break my addiction?\u0014\nby Janet Taylor Rolle\u0014\n\u0014\nHere I was again, in jail. I was being arrested for the same old \nthing--prostitution.\u0014\nId been prostituting since 1985, when I got hooked on crack cocaine \nat the age of 27. At first, my cocaine use was purely social; I tried \nit at the parties I attended while serving in the Navy, living \noff-base in Norfolk, Virginia. I loved the euphoria cocaine gave me; \nit produced such a rush that before long, I started using it by \nmyself to keep the feeling going. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I quickly learned the downside to a cocaine high: The rush wears \noff quickly, and in its place come feelings of fear and depression. \nIn order to avoid coming down, I repeatedly tried to capture that \ninitial euphoria by using more and more. Before I knew what hit me, I \nhad a full-fledged drug habit. What started as a recreational pastime \nbecame an ugly monster I couldnt get off my back. To pay for my \nhabit, I turned to prostitution. \u0014\n\u0014\nI began my career as a prostitute in Daytona Beach, Florida. After \nreceiving an honorable discharge from the Navy, a friend and I moved \nto San Diego, California, where I got more heavily involved in crack. \nI decided a move to Daytona Beach might help me get my act together. \nBut with no job, I soon had to find other means to feed my growing \nhabit. After a few years working the streets, I eventually got \narrested. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe cops knew I was a street junkie, so it only took a small offer to \nlure me. Most of the time I was so high, I never saw it coming. \nEventually a judge told me I had a choice: Either I could go to \nprison, or leave Florida. I chose to move to Winston-Salem, North \nCarolina, where Id grown up. However, my mother and grandmother both \nhad died before I was 10, and what little family I had left wanted \nnothing to do with me.  After Id been on the streets awhile in \nWinston-Salem, I found myself homeless. Sometimes I slept in \nabandoned houses, empty apartment hallways, even empty cars. I once \neven sought shelter in the bed of an empty 18-wheeler during the dead \nof winter, when the wind chill made the temperatures sub-zero.\u0014\n \u0014\nDuring my years of addiction, I gave birth to three beautiful babies \nas an unwed mother--each of  the children had a different father. I \neventually lost custody of these precious angels and was even sent to \nprison twice for child neglect. I made my first trip to prison in \nRaleigh, North Carolina. My cocaine habit had consumed me. The \ndepartment of social services removed my children from my custody, \nbut I still couldnt get a grip on my life. Losing my children was \nthe darkest, most dismal time of my entire life. I felt unable to \nclimb out of the stinking black hole into which Id fallen. \u0014\n\u0014\nI repeatedly sought comfort in the arms of lovers who abused me \nphysically and emotionally. Smoking crack seemed to be my only way to \nescape the reality of my pain. I had nowhere to turn and no one to \nwhich to turn. \u0014\n\u0014\nI believed I was doomed to die a crack addict, like so many others \ndid. Barbara, a prostitute I knew, was killed by another crack addict \nover a cigarette. Pam was raped, tied to a tree, and stabbed \nrepeatedly. She died begging for her life. Wanda got thrown out of a \nmoving vehicle on a local interstate. She was hit repeatedly by \noncoming traffic before anyone realized it was a human body they were \nrunning over. \u0014\n\u0014\nId been so conditioned to this lifestyle, I told myself that when \nbad things happened, they were the \"hazards of the trade.\" I just \naccepted them. \u0014\n\u0014\nTHE LAST TIME I was arrested was February 1, 1994. The drugs had \ndeteriorated my body, and I was malnourished and dehydrated. But that \nnight, God sent an angel in the form of an undercover vice agent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I arrived at the police station, I was so hungry, I couldnt be \nproperly booked without a plate of food. Anyone whos ever been to \njail knows jailhouse food is nothing to be desired, but I begged the \nbooking officer to please let me have something to eat. One look into \nmy eyes, and she knew instantly I was in bad shape. \u0014\n\u0014\nCocaine withdrawal isnt the same as heroin withdrawal; instead of \nmuscle spasms or nausea, the addict is plagued by restlessness. Crack \naddicts need to relearn normal sleeping patterns and eating habits. \nYet those first three days in cellblock, I slept straight through, \nawaking only for meals. Once I re-gained my strength, I concocted a \nlie to deny my charges at my hearing. I told everyone Id been set \nup. I was afraid Id be sent back to prison. Id already been there \ntwice, and heard that if you went a third time, the system branded \nyou a three-time loser. I didnt want to become institutionalized. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, as I was awaiting trial, I was assigned to work in the \nlaundry room. The officer in charge gave everybody one hour to listen \nto the radio station of her choice. I asked to listen to the station \nthat played gospel music--reminding me of those childhood years Id \nspent singing in the church choir before my grandmother had passed \naway. The first song the station played was a song by the Dallas/Fort \nWorth Mass Choir entitled \"Another Chance.\" The words were, \"Im \nsorry, forgive me, clean me, and give me another chance.\" The song \nexpressed exactly what I longed for inside, and began to break \nthrough my brazen exterior. As I listened to that song, I began to \ncry. I walked over to the radio and began to talk to God as if he \nwere inside it. \u0014\n\u0014\nI told God how sorry I was for all the sinful things Id done, and \nasked him to forgive me. I asked him to clean me up, to give me \nanother chance. There, in front of that radio in the laundry room of \nthe Forsyth County Jail, I asked Jesus to come into my life, to be my \npersonal Savior and leader of my life. At that moment, I knew Id \nbeen set free. Id never use cocaine again. \u0014\n\u0014\nMY COURT DATE was set for March 16, 1994. I didnt meet my \ncourt-appointed attorney until the day of my trial. When I arrived in \nthe holding cell, he asked me how I was going to plead. When I told \nhim \"not guilty,\" he turned and left.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as I waited for them to call my case, I suddenly felt a voice say \nto me, Jan, trust me. I looked around, but no one was there. Again a \nvoice repeated, Jan, trust me. It dawned on me this was Gods voice, \nand I began to weep. I told God if I spoke the truth, the judge would \nsend me to prison again and I didnt want to be a three-time loser. \nBut I knew what I had to do. I banged on the door for the sheriff, \nand when he appeared, I asked him to locate my attorney be-cause I \nwanted to change my plea.\u0014\n\u0014\nI walked into that courtroom filled with fear and shame. I pleaded \nguilty to the charges and allowed my attorney to finish pleading my \ncase. Suddenly a strange yet wonderful thing happened. The judge \nproceeded to ask me questions and I threw myself on the mercy of the \ncourt, telling him of my long battle with crack cocaine. I told him \nhow desperately I wanted to do what was right, but couldnt. Then a \nwoman whom Id known for years, who worked at the courthouse, spoke \nto the judge on my behalf. God used this woman to soften the judges \nheart. When the trial ended, I was free to go on probation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN I WAS released from the Forsyth County Jail, I didnt know where \nI was going to live or work, or even how I was going to pay my \nprobation fines. The only thing I knew was that Id never turn to \ndrugs or prostitution again. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond Corinthians 5:17 says, \"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new \ncreation; the old has gone, the new has come!\" God gave me another \nchance, a brand-new life. Right away I got involved in a church, and \nas I read Gods Word and applied it to my heart, I found the strength \nI needed to stay clean. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis past January, I married Derrick Rolle, a long-time friend with \nwhom Ive worked as a secretary. After Derrick committed his life to \nGod last year, I knew our relationship was ready to progress beyond \nfriendship, and Derrick asked for my hand in marriage last November. \nAlthough I dont have custody of my three children, Im able to be a \nmom to Derricks two children. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm now a junior at Winston-Salem State University, I substitute \nteach for the Forsyth County School District, and I teach a womens \nBible study in the Forsyth County Jail every Monday night. Im part \nof a witness team in the same womens prison I once was sentenced to \nin Raleigh, North Carolina. \u0014\n\u0014\nI really knew my life was changed when I began prison ministry, \nbecause Id previously begged the prison officials to let me out. Now \nIm begging them to let me back in! I go back not as an inmate, but \nas living proof that God is real. Im constantly amazed at what Gods \ndone with my broken life. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past five years, Ive served meals on Christmas Day in my \nhome to a large gathering of the homeless. Believe me, I know what it \nfeels like to be hungry and without shelter. Ive also had countless \nopportunities to share my story. Im often called upon to speak to \nyouth groups and church congregations. Im so glad Gods able to use \nfor his glory all Ive been through. What a great privilege it is to \nattest to the awesome power of Gods amazing grace!\u0014\n\u0014\nJANET TAYLOR ROLLE, a substitute teacher for the Forsyth County \nSchool District, can be reached through the First Presbyterian \nChurch, 300 N. Cherry St., Winston-Salem, NC 27101.\u0014",

Joyce \nSchowalter\u0014\nHouston, Texas, USA\u0014\n\u0014\n   At 27 years old, I began getting angry, then my anger turned into \nrage.\u0014\nIssues of my past had been dealt with, or so I thought. Yet, maybe I \nwas\u0014\nangry at my father because I perceived him as angry person who \nverbally\u0014\nbattered me. To discover the reason for the anger, therapy was \nnecessary.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In January 1994, my journey began. Some of my rage came from my\u0014\nperceptions of my father. The primary cause seemed to be residual\u0014\nfeelings from childhood sexual abuse. One of the healing projects \noffered\u0014\nas therapy was to make a collage, something to expel the hurt, pain \nand\u0014\nrage that I felt as a result of childhood sexual abuse by family \nmembers.\u0014\nI knew this project was for me, and I started saving magazines and\u0014\nnewspapers. I bought special crayons, glue and special tape. During\u0014\nmonths of preparation I cut out pictures, letters and words from\u0014\nnewspapers. I tried to replicate every childhood drawing I'd done. \nEvery\u0014\npart of my being went into this.\u0014\n\u0014\n   My husband was so patient and accepting during this time, \nespecially\u0014\nwhen it came to the day that I made my collage. I had to do this by\u0014\nmyself, but I couldn't be alone. My husband sat quietly in the room \nwith\u0014\nme while I cut, glued, colored, pasted and cried. He sat so calmly, \nwith\u0014\nsuch love.\u0014\n\u0014\n   After hours of work, gallons of glue, and oceans of tears, I stood \nup,\u0014\nachy, but proud and tall. I showed my husband what I'd done, to share\u0014\nwith him this healing that I had earned and deserved. He stared for \nwhat\u0014\nseemed an eternity. He asked if he could put something on it. I \ncouldn't\u0014\nbelieve that he would be so intrusive to want to \"mess up\" my work. \nThen\u0014\nI stopped. \"He needs this too,\" I thought. \"He's listened to me, been\u0014\nthere for me, and caught so many tears.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   I thought he'd draw a stick figure, or write something funny, but \nwhat\u0014\nhe did changed my life forever. He walked to the bathroom medicine\u0014\ncabinet and came back carrying something small. I asked what it was; \nhe\u0014\njust said to wait. Taking my posterboard to the table, he bent over \nfor a\u0014\nminute and came back to me. I looked and stared in total disbelief. \nThe\u0014\nprofundity of what he'd done went immediately to my heart, and the\u0014\nhealing tears flowed more than ever. I began another part of a \nwonderful\u0014\njourney in my life.\u0014\n\u0014\n   What did he do? He took a small Band-Aid and placed it in a very \nsmall\u0014\ncorner. With a red crayon, he wrote LOV, the O being a heart. My life\u0014\ntruly was forever changed, in how I perceived myself and people, and \nwhat\u0014\nI believed people thought of me. One small Band-Aid, and I knew my \npast\u0014\ncould never again prevent me from being loved.\u0014",

    "words": "What a difference 40+ years can make! This is hilarious! The \nfollowing is\u0014\nfrom an actual 1950's Home Economics textbook intended for High School\u0014\ngirls, teaching them how to prepare for married life. \u0014\n\u0014\n1. HAVE DINNER READY: Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a\u0014\ndelicious meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that you \nhave\u0014\nbeen thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs. Most men \nare\u0014\nhungry when they come home and the prospects of a good meal are part \nof\u0014\nthe warm welcome needed. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. PREPARE YOURSELF: Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed \nwhen\u0014\nhe arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be \nfresh\u0014\nlooking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a \nlittle gay\u0014\nand a little more interesting. His boring day may need a lift. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER. Make one last trip through the main part of the\u0014\nhouse just before your husband arrives, gathering up school books, \ntoys,\u0014\npaper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband will \nfeel\u0014\nhe has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift \ntoo. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. PREPARE THE CHILDREN. Take a few minutes to wash the children's \nhands\u0014\nand faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary, change\u0014\ntheir clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to see them\u0014\nplaying the part. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. MINIMIZE THE NOISE: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all \nnoise of\u0014\nwasher, dryer, or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. \nGreet\u0014\nhim with a warm smile and kiss, letting him know you're glad to see \nhim. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Some Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't\u0014\ncomplain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with \nwhat\u0014\nhe might have gone through that day. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or\u0014\nsuggest he lay down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready \nfor\u0014\nhim. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a \nlow,\u0014\nsoft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and unwind. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. LISTEN TO HIM: You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the \nmoment\u0014\nof his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not take you out to\u0014\ndinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to understand \nhis\u0014\nworld of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax. \u0014\n\u0014\n10. THE GOAL: try to make your home a place of peace and order where \nyour\u0014\nhusband can relax. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \u0014\nWELCOME TO 2000! \u0014\n\u0014\n1. HAVE DINNER READY: Make reservations ahead of time. If your day \nbecomes\u0014\ntoo hectic just leave him a voice mail message regarding where you'd \nlike\u0014\nto eat and at what time. This lets him know that your day has been \ncrappy\u0014\nand gives him an opportunity to change your mood. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. PREPARE YOURSELF: Make sure to change out of your work clothes into\u0014\nsomething comfortable. Who cares if he likes it or not . . . after \nall,\u0014\nit's most likely his T-shirt and boxers. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER: Yeah right! Tell the kids and your husband if \nthey\u0014\nwant maid service, they better call one! \u0014\n\u0014\n4. PREPARE THE CHILDREN: Send the children to their rooms to watch\u0014\ntelevision or play Nintendo. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. MINIMIZE THE NOISE: Yell to him over the loud music your kids are\u0014\nplaying, that this is what you had to put up with while he was gone. \nAnd\u0014\nmention that it was his decision to buy the kids a new CD player in \nthe\u0014\nfirst place. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. SOME Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems and complaints. Let him\u0014\nspeak first, and then your complaints will get more attention and \nremain\u0014\nfresh in his mind throughout dinner. Don't complain if he's late for\u0014\ndinner, simply remind him that the leftovers are in the fridge and you\u0014\nleft the dishes for him to do. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE: Tell him where he can find a blanket if he's\u0014\ncold. This will really show you care. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. LISTEN TO HIM: But don't ever let him get the last word. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not take you out to\u0014\ndinner or other places of entertainment; go with a friend or go \nshopping\u0014\n(use his credit card). Familiarize him with the phrase \"Girls'Night \nOut!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n10. THE GOAL: Try to keep things amicable without reminding him that \nhe\u0014\nonly thinks the world revolves around him. Obviously he's wrong, it\u0014\nrevolves around you.\u0014",

    "words": "How Well are we Teaching And How Well are People Listening?\u0014\n\u0014\nPollster George Gallup Jr. has long referred to America as a \"nation \nof\u0014\nbiblical illiterates.\" Only four in 10 Americans know that Jesus\u0014\ndelivered the Sermon on the Mount. A majority of citizens cannot name\u0014\nthe four Gospels of the New Testament. Only three in 10 teenagers know\u0014\nwhy Easter is celebrated. Two-thirds of Americans believe there are \nfew,\u0014\nif any, absolute principles to direct human behavior. A new poll by \nthe\u0014\nBarna Research Group suggests that religious illiteracy has increased.\u0014\nFor example, three out of four Americans (and nearly half of\u0014\n\"born-again\" Christians) believe the Bible teaches that \"God helps \nthose\u0014\nwho help themselves.\" George Barna argues that self-reliance is not \nonly\u0014\nnot scriptural, but that it contradicts revelation. Only God \ndetermines\u0014\na person's destiny, the pollster notes. To believe otherwise \"exposes\u0014\nour false theological cornerstone - that we are the center of things,\u0014\nthat it is up to us to determine our destiny, and that God is merely \nour\u0014\nassistant ...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA similar number of born-again Christians deny the existence of the \nHoly\u0014\nSpirit and Satan. One in five denies Jesus' physical resurrection and\u0014\nbelieves he was a sinner.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier surveys of mainline Protestants revealed that barely half of\u0014\nLutherans, Methodists, and Presbyterians believe in the devil, but 56\u0014\npercent of Lutherans and 49 percent of Methodists believe in UFOs.\u0014\nOne-third of Methodists and Presbyterians have faith in astrology. \nWhile\u0014\nnearly three-fourths of all Americans believe in hell, hardly any\u0014\nbelieve it to be their likely destination in eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new Barna poll is intended to help Christian pastors and groups\u0014\nfocus their ministries. The sheer number of \"errant theological\u0014\npositions\" among believers underscores \"the magnitude of the challenge\u0014\nfacing churches today,\" Barna notes.\u0014\n\u0014\nUniversity of Wisconsin historian Thomas Reeves indicts popular\u0014\nreligious belief and service. \"Christianity in modern America is, in\u0014\nlarge part, innocuous,\" he writes. \"It tends to be easy, upbeat,\u0014\nconvenient, andcompatible. It does not require self-sacrifice,\u0014\ndiscipline, humility, an otherworldly outlook, a zeal for souls, a \nfear\u0014\nas well as love of God. There is little guilt and no punishment, and \nthe\u0014\npayoff in heaven is virtually certain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Secretary of Education William Bennett concludes that \"We have\u0014\nbecome the kind of society that civilized countries used to send\u0014\nmissionaries to.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are harsh judgments. Perhaps we have been so busy pursuing the\u0014\nAmerican Dream of the good life that we have neglected to nurture the\u0014\nfaith on which the Dream is founded. If so, our only fault is\u0014\ninattention. If at the millennium our common faith has faltered, or \nhas\u0014\nshriveled for lack of nourishment, or has been supplanted by\u0014\nsentimentality, at least we have not succumbed to cynicism. Faith has\u0014\nnot been lost, only misplaced. As a people, we can retrieve it \ntogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Yount, \"Beggaring Belief,\" September 04, 2000,  Scripps Howard\u0014\nNews Service.\u0014",

    "words": "Handoff From The \nHeart\u0014\n\u0014\nTO SEE HIS BIG BROTHER WIN ON SATURDAYS, JOEY\u0014\nCappelletti had to win on Fridays.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonday through Thursday Joey stoically endured spinal taps and \nchemotherapy headaches and nausea, doctors and medications. He could \nbarely leave bed. But he brightened and bounced around like any other \nkid when Friday came. He knew that if he let the leukemia beat him \nthat day his parents would think he was too sick for a football \nweekend in State College, Pa. And for Joey there was nothing like a \nfootball weekend in State College, where his brother, John, was Penn \nState's star tailback and Joey was one of the guys. Going up there \nwas like we were going to heaven, says the boys' father, John \nCappelletti Sr.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter watching his brother run through opponents, Joey would slip \ninto the locker room to see him, say hello to Penn State coach Joe \nPaterno and go from locker to locker, ribbing his buddies on the team.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe weekends so exhausted Joey that he sometimes needed hospital \nvisits to recover. His dedication wasn't lost on John, though. He \nwould always rally himself, he says. No matter how sick he was, \nhe'd have to get ready for the game. That started to be my mentality \nHe was doing it, so I was doing it the same way\u0014\n\u0014\nJoey's motivation would carry John a long wayto the 1973 Heisman \nTrophy and what may be the most emotional moment in the history of \nfootball's most storied award.\u0014\n\u0014\nCappelletti's Heisman hopes got a big lift the last weekend in \nOctober when the Nittany Lions faced West Virginia a few days before \nJoey's 11th birthday In the pregame locker room, John asked what his \nbrother wanted as a present. Three touchdowns, Joey replied. No, \nfour.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn reluctantly agreed, stomping the Mountaineers for three \nfirst-half scores before Paterno decided to give his powerful \nworkhorse the rest of the day off. But when a Lions player told the \ncoach about Joey's birthday wish, Paterno ordered number 22 back in. \nCappelletti rushed onto the field, scored that fourth touchdown and \nsmiled as he trotted to the bench. Thanks for my present! Joey \nyelled from the stands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was nothing compared to John's next gift. After finishing the \nseason with 1,522 yards and 17 touchdowns for the undefeated Lions, \nCappelletti became Penn State's only Heisman winner, beating Ohio \nState offensive tackle John Hicks.\u0014\n\u0014\nToward the end of his acceptance speech at the black-tie Heisman \ndinner, Cappelletti spoke from the heart, not from the script he had \nwritten with brother Martin earlier that day My brother Joseph is \nill. He has leukemia, John said, tears streaking his face. They say \nI've shown courage on the football field, but for me it's only on the \nfield, and only in the fall. Joey lives with pain all the time. His \ncourage is round the clock. I want him to have this trophy. It's more \nhis than mine, because he's been such an inspiration to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmidst sobs from a crowd including Vice President Gerald Ford, Joey \nturned to his mom, Anne, and said, Did he really JUST GIVE ME THE \nHEISMAN TROPHY? Joey put the trophy on the mantel at home, next to \none he earned in Little League baseball.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Cappelletti helped Penn State complete a 12-0 season with an \nOrange Bowl win over LSU, he moved on to the Los Angeles Rams. A \nlittle more than two years later, at the age of 13 and eight years \nafter he was diagnosed with leukemia, Joey died with John at his \nbedside.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe brothers' close bond was recounted in a 1977 TV movie and \nyoung-adult book titled \"Something for Joey.\" John still answers \nletters from students touched by the story People write, 'I never \nappreciated my family as much as I do now,' John says. Having some \nsmall contribution to someone's life is a lot more meaningful than \nscoring some touchdowns.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCappelletti, 48, now a businessman and father of four in Southern \nCalifornia, has worked with Ronald McDonald House and other \nleukemia-related organizations. He believes Joey has inspired others \nto do the same. John and his parents are grateful that Joey's death, \nand the poignancy of John's speech, have influenced so many people.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoey was an extra-special person, says Anne, who still visits \nschools with her husband to discuss the book. He had a lot of love \nfor everybody.  When I think back, it seems like it all\thad to be. \nSomehow Joey had to leave his mark. Maybe the family's story should \nhave been called \"Something from Joey.\"Brad Young\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more Heisman Heroes, visit cnnsi.com/heisman\u0014",

But in modern business (and\u0014\neducation and government) because heavy investment factors are taken\u0014\ninto consideration, other strategies are often tried with dead horses,\u0014\nincluding the following:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.    Buying a stronger whip.\u0014\n2.    Changing riders.\u0014\n3.    Threatening the horse with termination.\u0014\n4.    Appointing a committee to study the horse.\u0014\n5.    Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.\u0014\n6.    Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.\u0014\n7.    Reclassifying the dead horse as \"living impaired\".\u0014\n8.    Hiring outside contractors to ride the dead horse.\u0014\n9.    Harnessing several dead horses together to increase speed.\u0014\n10.  Providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead\u0014\nhorse's performance.\u0014\n11.  Doing a productivity study to see if lighter riders would improve\u0014\nthe dead horse's performance.\u0014\n12.  Declaring that the dead horse carries lower overhead and \ntherefore\u0014\ncontributes more to the bottom line than some other horses. \u0014\n13.  Rewriting the expected performance requirements for all horses.\u0014\n14.  Promoting the dead horse to a supervisory position.\u0014",

He could\u0014\n                   barely leave bed. But he brightened and bounced \naround like any other kid\u0014\n                   when Friday came. He knew that if he let the \nleukemia beat him that day,\u0014\n                   his parents would think he was too sick for a \nfootball weekend in State\u0014\n                   College, Pa. And for Joey, there was nothing like \na football weekend in\u0014\n                   State College, where his brother, John, was Penn \nState's star tailback and\u0014\n                   Joey was one of the guys. \"Going up there was like \nwe were going to\u0014\n                   heaven,\" says the boys' father, John Cappelletti \nSr. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   After watching his brother run through opponents, \nJoey would slip into the\u0014\n                   locker room to see him, say hello to Penn State \ncoach Joe Paterno and go\u0014\n                   from locker to locker, ribbing his buddies on the \nteam. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The weekends so exhausted Joey that he sometimes \nneeded hospital visits\u0014\n                   to recover. His dedication wasn't lost on John, \nthough. \"He would always\u0014\n                   rally himself,\" he says. \"No matter how sick he \nwas, he'd have to get ready\u0014\n                   for the game.

In the pregame locker room, John asked \nwhat his brother wanted\u0014\n                   as a present. \"Three touchdowns,\" Joey replied. \n\"No, four.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   John reluctantly agreed, stomping the Mountaineers \nfor three first-half\u0014\n                   scores before Paterno decided to give his powerful \nworkhorse the rest of\u0014\n                   the day off. But when a Lions player told the \ncoach about Joey's birthday\u0014\n                   wish, Paterno ordered number 22 back in. \nCappelletti rushed onto the\u0014\n                   field, scored that fourth touchdown and smiled as \nhe trotted to the bench.\u0014\n                   \"Thanks for my present!\" Joey yelled from the \nstands. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   That was nothing compared to John's next gift. \nAfter finishing the season\u0014\n                   with 1,522 yards and 17 touchdowns for the \nundefeated Lions, Cappelletti\u0014\n                   became Penn State's only Heisman winner, beating \nOhio State offensive\u0014\n                   tackle John Hicks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Toward the end of his acceptance speech at the \nblack-tie Heisman dinner,\u0014\n                   Cappelletti spoke from the heart, not from the \nscript he had written with\u0014\n                   brother Martin earlier that day. \"My brother \nJoseph is ill. He has\u0014\n                   leukemia,\" John said, tears streaking his face. \n\"They say I've shown\u0014\n                   courage on the football field, but for me it's \nonly on the field, and only in\u0014\n                   the fall. Joey lives with pain all the time. His \ncourage is round the clock. I\u0014\n                   want him to have this trophy. It's more his than \nmine, because he's been\u0014\n                   such an inspiration to me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Amidst sobs from a crowd including Vice President \nGerald Ford, Joey\u0014\n                   turned to his mom, Anne, and said, \"Did he really \njust give me the Heisman\u0014\n                   Trophy?\" Joey put the trophy on the mantel at \nhome, next to one he earned\u0014\n                   in Little League baseball. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   After Cappelletti helped Penn State complete a \n12-0 season with an\u0014\n                   Orange Bowl win over LSU, he moved on to the Los \nAngeles Rams. A\u0014\n                   little more than two years later, at the age of 13 \nand eight years after he\u0014\n                   was diagnosed with leukemia, Joey died with John \nat his bedside. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The brothers' close bond was recounted in a 1977 \nTV movie and\u0014\n                   young-adult book titled Something for Joey. John \nstill answers letters from\u0014\n                   students touched by the story. \"People write, 'I \nnever appreciated my\u0014\n                   family as much as I do now,'\" John says. \"Having \nsome small contribution\u0014\n                   to someone's life is a lot more meaningful than \nscoring some touchdowns.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Cappelletti, 48, now a businessman and father of \nfour in Southern\u0014\n                   California, has worked with Ronald McDonald House \nand other\u0014\n                   leukemia-related organizations. He believes Joey \nhas inspired others to do\u0014\n                   the same. John and his parents are grateful that \nJoey's death, and the\u0014\n                   poignancy of John's speech, have influenced so \nmany people. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   \"Joey was an extra-special person,\" says Anne, who \nstill visits schools with\u0014\n                   her husband to discuss the book. \"He had a lot of \nlove for everybody.\u0014\n                   When I think back, it seems like it all had to be. \nSomehow Joey had to\u0014\n                   leave his mark.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Maybe the family's story should have been called \nSomething from Joey. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   -- Brad Young\u0014",

The primary\u0014\nshepherd/pastor is the Lord himself (Psalm 23), but the Bible\u0014\nalso recognizes human undershepherds.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the New Testament instructs elders to be good shepherds.\u0014\n\"Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock,\" writes Paul.\u0014\n\"Savage wolves will come in among you.... So be on your guard!\"\u0014\n(Acts 20:28-31).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Bible, then, pastoring is presented primarily as\u0014\nprotecting and feeding the flock of God. But over the centuries,\u0014\nthese essential functions developed into specific and distinct\u0014\nroles.\u0014\n\u0014\nPREACHER\u0014\nThe Reformation recovered the emphasis on the pastor as the\u0014\n\"teacher of God's Word.\" Preaching had been neglected. But the\u0014\nReformers restored preaching to its place. Breaking the Bread of\u0014\nLife means, in part, preaching the Word.\u0014\n\u0014\nCURER OF SOULS\u0014\nIn the 1600s, the Puritans enhanced the concept of pastor by\u0014\nstressing the pastor as a \"physician of the soul\" -- a spiritual\u0014\ndirector. This means knowing a person's spiritual condition --\u0014\nhealthy or unhealthy -- primarily by asking questions such as:\u0014\nHow is it with your soul? Are you resisting evil? How are you\u0014\nserving God?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if the physician of souls discovers the fundamental ill, he\u0014\nprescribes some remedy to restore spiritual health and vitality.\u0014\nAs theologian (and contemporary Puritan) J.I. Packer describes\u0014\nit: \"There is such a thing as spiritual depression. Relationships\u0014\nor a marriage can collapse under you. Children disappoint you.\u0014\nThe business can go bankrupt. You may be grieving. And all these\u0014\ntraumatic events produce in the Christian states of mind and\u0014\nemotion that call for spiritual counsel, because we've got to\u0014\nlive to the glory of God, and all our moods have to be brought\u0014\ninto relation to God, his love, his work, and the ongoing process\u0014\nof sanctification.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The sanctifying of troubles is a prominent New Testament theme.\u0014\nTroubles are to be expected, but God sanctifies them all. The\u0014\npastor, in the Puritan understanding, is there to be God's agent,\u0014\nGod's lightning rod, if you like, actually achieving the\u0014\ntransforming link between the distress of the Christian and the\u0014\nlove and power of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nARRANGER OF RELATIONSHIPS\u0014\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of the Methodist\u0014\nawakening in the 1700s was organizing people into groups in order\u0014\nto \"maintain the glow\" that the Lord had ignited in the hearts of\u0014\nso many. Thus, every Methodist conference (or regional group)\u0014\nwould be subdivided into classes, every member expected to\u0014\nparticipate in a class -- 12 persons with a leader. And the\u0014\nclasses, like home groups today, would meet once a week between\u0014\nSundays. Under the class leader, these small groups would pray\u0014\ntogether, discuss Scripture, share their experience with each\u0014\nother, and try to encourage each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo in Methodist circles pastors became leaders of Christian\u0014\ncommunity, the overseers of small groups for the purpose of\u0014\nnurturing believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nMANAGER AND MISSIONARY\u0014\nWith individualism and isolation increasing, the need for\u0014\ncommunity is stronger than ever. Pastors have assumed more of a\u0014\nrole in maintaining corporate life, or put more crassly, \"running\u0014\na church\" -- recruiting, motivating, administering.\u0014\n\u0014\nPut positively, the pastor now finds himself extending the role\u0014\nof \"organizer of nurturing relationships,\" tending to the health\u0014\nof the community. The downside is that the pastor feels more a\u0014\nmanager of church business than a shepherd of souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd surrounded by a decreasingly Christian society, pastors have\u0014\nbecome missionaries to their own neighborhoods. Whether in a\u0014\n\"seeker sensitive\" church or not, every pastor is now aware of\u0014\nthe need for outreach and evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the task of protecting and feeding the flock widens.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Marshall Shelley is editor of Leadership.

    "title": "HOW ARE YOU MEDICATING YOUR PAIN?",
    "words": "HOW ARE YOU MEDICATING YOUR PAIN?\u0014\nA probing question for people we help\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Kevin A. Miller\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christian leaders, people often come to us in pain, confused,\u0014\nbroken, addicted. They need help, counsel, freedom from sin. How\u0014\ndo we discern the core of their need? How do we guide them to\u0014\nGod?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne powerful question I've learned to ask is, \"How is this person\u0014\nmedicating his or her pain?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nScott Peck began a best-selling book with a sentence only three\u0014\nwords long: \"Life is difficult.\" Life starts difficult, when\u0014\nwe're forcibly pushed from the warm, soothing womb into the cold,\u0014\nglaring lights, then turned upside down and smacked. Life ends\u0014\ndifficult, when we're struck down by cancer, emphysema, stroke,\u0014\nor old age. And every day in between has some degree of\u0014\ndifficulty.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo very early on, we learn to soothe our pain. We cry till our\u0014\nmomma comes and holds us. We suck our thumb or hide under the\u0014\nblankets. And then we discover more socially advanced ways of\u0014\nsoothing our pain: getting a good grade, making somebody laugh,\u0014\ndressing up and getting a compliment.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we also find chemical ways to soothe our pain: drinking Surge\u0014\nCola, taking a long drag on a cigarette, popping half a box of\u0014\nchocolates, drinking a rum and Coke. We can also pump our own\u0014\nadrenaline to soothe pain, by going to scary movies, driving\u0014\nfast, getting angry, looking at porn, or booking our lives full\u0014\nof activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the bottom line is, we still have pain, because life is\u0014\ndifficult. And that's where spirituality comes in. Richard Rohr,\u0014\nan author and retreat leader, says that \"Spirituality is all\u0014\nabout what you do with your pain.\" You can choose to medicate it,\u0014\nor you can face it in God's presence. One path stifles growth,\u0014\nthe other promotes it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo when someone comes to us for spiritual counsel, we should\u0014\nlisten well and ask ourselves, \"How is this person medicating his\u0014\npain? What are the deep agonies in his soul, and how is he\u0014\ndealing with those?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe often notice alcohol, drugs, and pornography, but may miss the\u0014\nmore socially acceptable medications of performance, anger,\u0014\neating, achievement at work, shopping. [I exclude from this list\u0014\nsubstances properly designed to medicate, such as\u0014\nantidepressants.]\u0014\n\u0014\nGod sees each of us turning to this thing when we're down. God\u0014\nsees us looking forward to it. God sees our hearts going after\u0014\nit, asking this thing to tell us, \"It's okay. Life's okay. You're\u0014\nspecial. You matter.\" Henry Blackaby, the author of Experiencing\u0014\nGod, explains that \"An idol is anything you turn to for help when\u0014\nGod told you to turn to Him for help.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle John warns in 1 John 5:2: \"Dear children, keep away\u0014\nfrom anything that might take God's place in your hearts.\" And\u0014\nthe prophet Jeremiah cries out in agony with these words from\u0014\nGod: \"You've forsaken me, the pure spring, and built broken\u0014\ncisterns that can't hold water.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the people you're ministering to want to grow spiritually and\u0014\nbecome closer to God, they need to know when they're slipping\u0014\nover the line and using something to medicate their pain and\u0014\nletting it become an idol in their life. The challenge, though,\u0014\nis that when people are medicating their pain with something,\u0014\nthey won't want to give it up. It may be wisest not to take the\u0014\nfrontal approach and demand that they do. The resistance you'll\u0014\nencounter will be ferocious.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, we can help people say yes to something even better.\u0014\nHenri Nouwen once said in a Leadership Journal interview: \"I\u0014\ncannot continuously say 'No' to this or 'No' to that, unless\u0014\nthere is something ten times more attractive to choose. Saying\u0014\n'No' to my lust, my greed, my needs, and the world's powers takes\u0014\nan enormous amount of energy. The only hope is to find something\u0014\nso obviously real and attractive that I can devote all my\u0014\nenergies to saying 'Yes.' ... One such thing I can say 'Yes' to\u0014\nis when I come in touch with the fact that I am loved. Once I\u0014\nhave found that in my total brokenness I am still loved, I become\u0014\nfree from the compulsion of doing successful things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething miraculous happens when people contact God's love --\u0014\nthrough listening in prayer, reading Scripture, receiving the\u0014\nkindness of others. As we help people experience God and his\u0014\nmercy, they gradually become free from the need to medicate their\u0014\npain.\u0014",

Bell high schools.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    The teams are affiliated with the Southwestern \nBell Metroplex High School Hockey League,\u0014\n                    not with a school district.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Beckham did not return a telephone call seeking \ncomment. Her attorney, Judith Grantham of\u0014\n                    Dallas, said Beckham is innocent and blamed the \nStarCenter for not controlling rowdy fans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"If the DA does pursue these charges, we intend \nto defend them vigorously,\" Grantham said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    According to police reports, Beckham confronted a \n17-year- old Trinity fan who was yelling at\u0014\n                    her son, a Trinity hockey player. Police said \nBeckham pushed the youth, who fell down the\u0014\n                    bleachers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    StarCenter manager Karen Wichman told Beckham \nthat she would have to leave if she\u0014\n                    continued her behavior, according to police. \nWichman told police that Beckham then slapped\u0014\n                    her across the face with a rolled-up program.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    A warrant for Beckham's arrest was issued Jan. 30.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Wichman declined to comment and referred \nquestions to StarCenter general manager Bob\u0014\n                    Gallow, who could not be reached to comment \nMonday.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Beckham has been banned from the StarCenter and \nfrom team activities, Trinity hockey\u0014\n                    coach Keith Andresen said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    The incident follows other episodes of unruly \nfans at youth hockey games in Northeast Tarrant\u0014\n                    County.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    On Dec. 7, Carroll High School fans became rowdy \nafter a 4-2 victory against Grapevine High\u0014\n                    School at the StarCenter.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    As Grapevine players left the rink, Carroll \nstudents gathered in the stands near their exit,\u0014\n                    shouting at and heckling players as they walked \nto the locker room. Grapevine fans and\u0014\n                    parents shouted back at the Carroll students.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Off-duty police officers have since been hired at \nthe StarCenter to help with security at high\u0014\n                    school hockey games.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    In September in North Richland Hills, former \nRangers outfielder Pete Incaviglia was given a\u0014\n                    citation accusing him of assault by threat during \nhis son's hockey game.\u0014",

    "words": "Helping People Cope with the Unexpected Death of \nLoved Ones\u0014\n\u0014\nTo assist people in meeting the needs of church members grieving over \nthe unexpected death of a loved one, Carl Wrotenberry, former \nSouthwestern dean of libraries, offers suggestions found in his book \n\"After the Last Song: Dealing with Unexpected Death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our personal experiences have served as a basis for illustration \nbecause we know how we reacted to the violent death of our son and \nbecause we wanted our suggestions to come from a practical base \nrather than a theoretical one,\" said Wrotenberry, whose son was \nmurdered in 1988 in Houston, Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWrotenberry's suggestions include the following.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Allow the grieving person to tell the story over and over again. \nThis is a common need for the grieving, and they should be \naccommodated.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Know that no fixed patterns follow death, though shock is usually \nthe first stage. The exhibited symptoms and the length of time in \nwhich the grieving remains in shock vary.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Understand that violent deaths are difficult to handle because \npreparation is impossible. People can prepare when loved ones die \nfrom disease or old age.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Respond early to the death as a caregiver. Be able to tell close \nloved ones in person rather than by telephone if possible. The worst \nnews comes if it comes over the television news or from strangers \ninstead of from beloved family members.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Be specific in your offers to help. Leave notes indicating how you \nwill help. Avoid general, vague offers of assistance. Following \nthrough on specific offers gives the grieving one less detail to \nworry about.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Consider what to say to those grieving the death of loved ones. Your \npresence is likely more important than what you have to say during \nthe initial shock. Good intentions serve little value. Verbalize your \nprayers for the grieving; it helps them see that others care.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Share with the grieving person your relationship to the one who \nhas passed away. If you knew the deceased, share a good word or an \ninteresting anecdote. Moments of sharing are more therapeutic than \nefforts to make the death seem acceptable or misdirected statements \nabout God and His will.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Be prepared for the grieving family to act irritated and \ndisoriented. Common reactions with grief are undirected anger and \nirritability. Give the grieving an extra measure of tenderness; they \nneed it more than ever.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Don't push bogus theology on the grieving family. When the \ngrieving asks\u0014\n'why?\" they aren't necessarily raising a point of theology as they \nare struggling to assimilate the tragedy as reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe a sensitive listener rather than trying to talk the grieving into \nfeeling better. Not all questions need answers. Encourage the \ngrieving to talk about their pain and anger. Agree that much in the \nworld is irrational and nonsensical. Don't rush the person to change \nthe subject. Remember the word \"listen\" is an anagram of the word \n\"silent.\" Grievers need a listening ear, not an admonition.\u0014\n\u0014\nWrotenberry also offered suggestions to aid the grieving in long-term \nrecovery.\u0014\n\u0014\nGive the grieving an opportunity to talk about the death but do not \npressure them. People who practice this skill ask leading questions, \nallowing the grieving to take initiative or move on to another \nsubject. Remember to be sensitive, especially with hazy details \nsurrounding the death or investigations. Insensitivity can cause \nconsiderable, extended pain to the grieving.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Remember that survivors will likely never get completely over a \nviolent death. Nobody can make a calendar to schedule when grief will \nend.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Don't mislead those struggling with their grief by telling them \n\"time will heal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nConvince those who grieve that the intensity of their grief is not a \nvalid indicator of their love for the deceased.\u0014\n\u0014\n... Lay people are usually more helpful to the grieving than \npreachers.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Memorials to the deceased are very important to most survivors.\u0014\n\u0014\nEncourage the grieving to enroll in grief recovery sessions.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Avoid forcing family to make difficult decisions while they are in \nprecarious emotional states.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Cards and written notes mean more than you can imagine to a family \nin the months following a death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What we suggest is based on our personal experience, talking to \nothers who have worked their way through the death of a loved one and \nresearch over the past nine years,\" Wrotenberry said. \"We are all \ndifferent though. Remember, no standard formula exists for grief and \nrecovery.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCarl Wrotenberry is dean of libraries emeritus at Southwestern Bapt. \nTheol. Seminary\u0014",

Yesterday, 200 years \nago, they convened. The aggregation assembled in Philadelphia was \nprobably the noblest group ever to meet with a single purpose. They \nbickered and quibbled sometimes, as men will do; a small number seems \nto have carried a disproportionate share of  the work, as usually \nhappens when conventions and committees set out. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                    During the several subsequent \nsweltering months the 55 delegates produced the United States \nConstitution - described by Thomas Jefferson (who was not there) as \n\"unquestionably the wisest [document of government] ever yet \npresented to men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The waters of subsequent history have worn it here \nand gouged it there. Along the way, the public has altered and added \nto it 26 times. It has been dismissed as \"flawed,\" as even its \ndrafters knew it was. Its drafters themselves have been disparagingly \nsociologized as a conspiracy of \"haves\" who crafted the Constitution \nto keep \"have-nots\" forever down. But the document has endured; with \ndeath and taxes, it almost has become  the third certitude.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ASK THE NEXT X-number of people who pass you on the \nstreet who holds primary responsibility for the Constitution, as the \npollsters recently have done, and few will give you the right answer. \nMost, even (alas)  most Virginians, will say Mr. Jefferson. Only 1 \npercent nationally, and only 4 percent in Virginia, will name  the \nman from Montpelier - 5'2\" (probably), dressed almost always in black \n- a thinker so self-effacing, so quintessentially private, that even \nthough he served two terms as President he is eclipsed in history by \nhis party-giving wife.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  His name was James Madison. Without him, we would \nhave no Constitution. At 36, and a bachelor at the time, he brokered \nthe convention, took detailed notes of its proceedings (the only \ndelegate to do so), wrote the basic document, steered it through the \ndeliberations, and sold the finished product to a majority of \nthe1,706 delegates to ratifying conventions in the several states.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  HE DIDN'T write particularly grabby stuff, but it \nwas profound nevertheless - like this:\u0014\n\u0014\n                  It may be a reflection on human nature that \n[constitutions] should be necessary to control the abuses of \ngovernment. But what is government itself but the greatest of all \nreflections on human nature? If angels were to govern men, neither \nexternal or internal controls on government would be necessary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In framing a government which is to be administered \nby men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first \nenable the government to control the governed, and in the next place \noblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, \nthe primary control on the government; but experience has taught \nmankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  And this:\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Since the general civilization of mankind, I \nbelieve there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of \nthe people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than \nby violent and sudden usurpations. \u0014\n\u0014\nHOW WE ARRIVED here from the moment, on September 17, 1787, when 39 \nmen signed the Constitution, can be most aptly explained by our \nabiding belief in what the Constitution says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  We have proceeded through a combination of \nignorance and consensus. Few of us really know what the Constitution \ncontains. But practically all of us know it is largely responsible \nfor what we are and how we live, for the property we possess, for the \njustice we enjoy and the liberty we have. We do know, and deeply, \nthat without the Constitution our lives probably would be profoundly \nworse.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Forgotten or regarded as merely peripheral, James \nMadison wrote the Constitution and shepherded it through. He, and \nthat remarkable assemblage, gave us the machine of government on \nwhich all others, ever since, have variously been modeled. They gave \nus but a piece of parchment. But they gave us much more: a living \ntestament, the third certitude, that has made all the difference.\u0014",

The place didnt offer him many options.\u0014\n               Left behind by the economic boom, the town of 5,500\u0014\n               still depends largely on the aging coal and timber\u0014\n               \nindustrial                                                                                \u0014\n                 \u0014\n                      Playing With Pain Killers\u0014\n                      How One Town Got Hooked\u0014\n                      Even My Husband Never Knew\u0014\n                  \u0014\nI dont know how to explain the buzz. Its\u0014\n     just this utopic feeling. You feel like you can conquer the \nworld...\u0014\n     Its a better high than anything else. \u0014\n      JOSHUA COOTS\u0014\n                                            \u0014\n                                       EMPTY STOREFRONTS DOT the \ndepressed Main\u0014\n                         Street. Highway strip malls are about the \nonly places left to go\u0014\n                         for a night out. Coots couldnt imagine a \nlifetime hauling logs\u0014\n                         or toiling in the mines, where his father \nonce worked. Instead,\u0014\n                         he took a job as a telemarketer. In his off \nhours he hung out\u0014\n                         with friends in the park, smoking pot and \npopping pills. The\u0014\n                         drugs were a mild distraction, but did \nlittle for his mood. Then\u0014\n                         someone gave him the powerful prescription \npainkiller\u0014\n                         OxyContin. When crushed, the pills delivered \na euphoric,\u0014\n                         heroin-like punch. I dont know how to \nexplain the buzz, says\u0014\n                         Coots, now 21. Its just this utopic \nfeeling. You feel like you\u0014\n                         can conquer the world... Its a better high \nthan anything else.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Coots was hooked. He started out with \na modest 20mg,\u0014\n                         but before long, he says, he needed 400mg \njust to make it\u0014\n                         through the day. And that took money. \nOxyContin is known as\u0014\n                         the poor mans heroin, but at a street price \nof $1 per milligram\u0014\n                         it can be anything but cheap. Coots quit his \njob and spent all\u0014\n                         his time in pursuit of the precious pills. \nEach morning began\u0014\n                         with an orange 40mg tablet, which he downed \nbefore getting\u0014\n                         out of bed. I couldnt hardly walk if I \ndidnt have it. At first he\u0014\n                         crushed and snorted the pills, after sucking \non them to remove\u0014\n                         the time-release coating. Later he dissolved \nthe powder in\u0014\n                         water and injected it for a quicker buzz. He \nfloated through the\u0014\n                         days in a dreamlike stupor, not even \nbothering to eat. His\u0014\n                         waist dropped from 42 inches to 36 inches in \ntwo months. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                As his cravings got worse, he found \ncreative ways to get\u0014\n                         hold of the pills. Sometimes he would fake \nback pain and get a\u0014\n                         shady local doctor to write him an Oxy \nprescription. Once, he\u0014\n                         even stole the pills from his grandfather, \nwho was taking them\u0014\n                         to dull the pain from a fractured spine. I \nhad to have more and\u0014\n                         more, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                These days, nearly everyone in Hazard \nhas an OxyContin\u0014\n                         horror story to tell. In the last year, \nlocal officials say, the drug\u0014\n                         has swept through the small town, wrecking \nlives and\u0014\n                         destroying families. Precise statistics are \nhard to pin down,\u0014\n                         but the number of local addicts runs in the \nhundreds. Oxy\u0014\n                         abuse cuts across income and age lines. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Teens meet for Oxy parties in the \npark. Miners blow their\u0014\n                         paychecks to feed their addictions. Even \ngrandmothers peddle\u0014\n                         their prescriptions for quick cash. In \nFebruary police rounded\u0014\n                         up more than 200 Oxy dealers in Hazard and \nsurrounding\u0014\n                         counties, the largest drug bust in state \nhistory. Hazards crime\u0014\n                         rate has soared; the jail is packed with \nOxy-addicted inmates.\u0014\n                         In nearby Harlan, Judge Ron Johnson \nsentenced a woman to\u0014\n                         10 years in prison for selling just four of \nthe pills. OxyContin is\u0014\n                         a pure scourge upon the land, he fumed \nfrom the bench. It is,\u0014\n                         he said, demonic fire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Hazard isnt the only place \nstruggling to quell the flames.\u0014\n                         Oxy has taken hold in other rural \nAppalachian states and in\u0014\n                         New England, places where its tougher to \nget more familiar\u0014\n                         street drugs like heroin and crack. The \ndrugs maker, Purdue\u0014\n                         Pharma, says it is appalled by the \nwidespread abuse of the\u0014\n                         drug, a form of synthetic morphine. When \nthis drug is used\u0014\n                         properly, it has the potential to save \nlives. When its abused, it\u0014\n                         has the potential to take lives, just like \nany other strong\u0014\n                         medication, says Dr. J. David Haddox, \nPurdue Pharmas\u0014\n                         medical director. In an effort to stem the \ndamage, Purdue has\u0014\n                         held workshops for doctors and met with the \nDEA and officials\u0014\n                         from five states. The company is even \nresearching new drugs\u0014\n                         that would be more tamper-proof and less \naddictive. But those\u0014\n                         efforts are years away from pharmacy \nshelves. Hazard isnt\u0014\n                         willing to wait. In recent months police and \ncommunity\u0014\n                         activists have joined forces to get \nOxyContin off the streets,\u0014\n                         and out of their town. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                   That could prove \ndifficult.\u0014\n                                            Hazard has a long \ntradition of\u0014\n                                            self-medication. \nMoonshine and\u0014\n                                            marijuana, grown in its \nfertile soil,\u0014\n                                            have long helped to blot \nout\u0014\n                                            depression, boredom, even\u0014\n                                            physical pain. Eastern \nKentucky\u0014\n                                            has one of the nations \nhighest\u0014\n                                            cancer rates, and many \nresidents\u0014\n                                            suffer from chronic \nmining and\u0014\n                                            timber injuries. \nOxyContin seemed\u0014\n                                            like the most potent \nantidote yet to\u0014\n                                            the local despair. If \ntheres ever\u0014\n                                            been a drug made that \nwill knock\u0014\n                                            depression out for the \nshort term,\u0014\n                                            its OxyContin, says \ntherapist Mike Spare. The euphoria\u0014\n                                            sucks you in.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Cindy McCain shares her story\u0014\n\u0014\n                                When the then police chief, Rod \nMaggard, first heard\u0014\n                         about Oxy in the summer of 1999, he had to \nask his\u0014\n                         pharmacist what it was. But by spring, he \nknew all too well\u0014\n                         what the drug was doing to his town. \nBurglaries and\u0014\n                         domestic-violence reports were up. Overdoses \nwere mounting\u0014\n                         at the local hospital. (State police count \n19 OxyContin-related\u0014\n                         deaths in Kentucky this year alone. Purdue \nPharma disputes\u0014\n                         the number.) Maggard, 57, who retired as \npolice chief in\u0014\n                         March, was flooded with hundreds of calls \nfrom families\u0014\n                         begging him to help get a son or daughter \noff the drug. I have\u0014\n                         never seen anything take off like this did, \nsays Maggard, a\u0014\n                         square-shouldered, gray-haired cop. It has \nmushroomed. On\u0014\n                         the wood-paneled wall above him hangs a \nprized painting\u0014\n                         called The Protectoran image of Jesus \nwith his hand on the\u0014\n                         hood of a flashing police cruiser.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Maggard was especially outraged that \nthe towns sole\u0014\n                         refuge, leafy, peaceful Perry County Park, \nhad become an\u0014\n                         open-air drug market. Clusters of teens and \nyoung adults\u0014\n                         jammed the parking lot near the Little \nLeague fields, lining up\u0014\n                         to buy Oxy. Nobody wanted to get stoned. \nNobody wanted to\u0014\n                         get drunk. Everybody wanted to go get an OC \nand sit in the\u0014\n                         park, says Holly, a recovering addict whos \nnow 21. Girls\u0014\n                         carried ceramic bathroom tiles in their \npurses so they could be\u0014\n                         ready to crush a pill anywhere, any time. In \na futile effort to\u0014\n                         control the trade, Maggard patrolled the \ngrounds in his\u0014\n                         unmarked car, installed surveillance cameras \nand had the park\u0014\n                         gates locked late at night. Nothing seemed \nto work. When\u0014\n                         addicts started referring to the park as \nPillville, Maggard\u0014\n                         called in the Feds for help. The DEA and \nother\u0014\n                         law-enforcement agencies set up an \nundercover task force.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                By then Hazard was in the throes of a \ncrime wave\u0014\n                         sparked by Oxy addicts searching for a fix. \nJames Wallace, a\u0014\n                         baby-faced 20-year-old, was locked in the \ndilapidated Perry\u0014\n                         County Jail for receiving stolen property. \nLeaning on a blue\u0014\n                         plastic picnic table in the jails smoky \nvisitors lounge, Wallace\u0014\n                         admits he stole televisions, guns, \nknivesall to earn money\u0014\n                         for Oxy. Sometimes hed even go into stores \nand claim the\u0014\n                         soda machine outside had taken his dollar. \nYoull do\u0014\n                         everything and anything, he says. In \nHazard, whatever he got\u0014\n                         his hands on could be traded for the drug. \nAddicts even lifted\u0014\n                         grocery-store steaks. At one Hazard fruit \nstand, you could\u0014\n                         swap food stamps for the pills.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Playing With Pain Killers\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Throughout the fall, Maggards \nundercover task force\u0014\n                         quietly plugged away. Police eventually \nseized 10,000\u0014\n                         OxyContin pills and bought an additional \n3,500 in sting\u0014\n                         operations. As they worked, Maggard and his \nteam traced the\u0014\n                         drugs route to Hazard. Most of the pills \ncame through a\u0014\n                         disturbingly convenient pipeline: the local \npharmacy. Dealers\u0014\n                         would fake injuries or visit a few \nunscrupulous doctors willing\u0014\n                         to write prescriptions for a $100 fee. \nSeveral doctors have\u0014\n                         already been charged, and Joseph Famularo, \nU.S. attorney for\u0014\n                         the eastern district of Kentucky, hints his \nnext round of\u0014\n                         indictments may target health-care workers \nexplicitly. Though\u0014\n                         Kentucky has a computer system designed to \ntrack narcotics\u0014\n                         prescriptions, Hazard was close enough to \nfive other states\u0014\n                         that doctor shoppers could easily cross \nborders. Many users\u0014\n                         paid cash for the pills. Others were bold \nenough to get\u0014\n                         Medicaid or private insurance to pick up the \ntab. Police even\u0014\n                         found some elderly patients who rationed \ntheir own pain pills\u0014\n                         and sold the rest. People were selling what \nthey should be\u0014\n                         taking, says Maggard.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                The task force got tips from an \nunlikely source: local\u0014\n                         churches. Late last fall pastors found \nthemselves conducting\u0014\n                         funeral services for a growing number of Oxy \noverdose victims.\u0014\n                         One October evening the weekly Bible-study \nsession at Petrey\u0014\n                         Memorial Baptist Church became a virtual \nOxyContin support\u0014\n                         group, as congregants spontaneously began \nsharing their\u0014\n                         stories about the drug. The Rev. Ronnie \n(Butch) Pennington\u0014\n                         launched a faith-based group, People Against \nDrugs. When he\u0014\n                         called a communitywide meeting on Oxy, so \nmany people\u0014\n                         responded that he had to move the location \ntwice to find a\u0014\n                         room large enough for the crowd. In the end, \nmore than 400\u0014\n                         people showed up. After the meeting \nparticipants called in 60\u0014\n                         tips about possible Oxy dealers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Police put them to use. As the sun \nrose on Feb. 6, more\u0014\n                         than 100 officers fanned out across eastern \nKentucky with a\u0014\n                         sheaf of arrest warrants. By evening, \nOperation Oxyfest 2001\u0014\n                         had rounded up 207 dealers. But a month \nlater people\u0014\n                         wondered if the arrests had even made a \ndent. Frustrated,\u0014\n                         Kentucky prosecutor John Hansen has vowed to \nfile murder\u0014\n                         charges against Oxy-overdose survivors, \nincluding family,\u0014\n                         friends and dealers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                With the whole town focused on \ncatching the dealers,\u0014\n                         Hazards addicts have largely been left to \nfend for themselves.\u0014\n                         The town still has no rehab program. Joshua \nCoots bottomed out about\u0014\n                         a year and a half ago. Hed lost his car, \ndeclared bankruptcy and wound                            up getting \narrested for stealing the family truck.\u0014\n                                                   \u0014\n                         One day he collapsed on his parents kitchen \nfloor. Mom and Dad, Im                              on Oxy and its \nkilling me, he sobbed. At a \nreligious                                                        \nrevival meeting, a visiting\u0014\n                         pastor preached about evil in peoples \nlives. He seemed to be\u0014\n                         looking straight at Coots, who wept \nsteadily, tears dripping off\u0014\n                         his mustache and down his chin. Was he ready \nto step into a\u0014\n                         new life? the preacher asked. Coots was. He \nquit Oxy cold\u0014\n                         turkey. It was miraculous, he says.\u0014\n                         \u0014\n                         Today, Main Street in Hazard has one fewer \nboarded-up\u0014\n                         storefront. In the building that once housed \na campaign office,\u0014\n                         Coots and his father, Pastor Donnie Coots, \nrefer Oxy addicts\u0014\n                         to private rehab programs out of state. In \nPillville, police are\u0014\n                         still rounding up dealers and users on \nweekends. The\u0014\n                         hundreds of busts have managed to decrease \nthe supply,\u0014\n                         making the drug more expensive. Yet the Oxy \nmarket\u0014\n                         continues to thrive. Too many people in \nHazard, it seems, are\u0014\n                         willing to pay any price. \u0014\n\u0014\n           \u0014\n                         \u0014\n                                    2001 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

And\u0014\n                      eventually kids shoot their classmates while \nlaughing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A historical parallel to Littleton took place \n75 years ago when\u0014\n                      two college students, Nathan Leopold and \nRichard Loeb,\u0014\n                      murdered a 14-year-old boy. Their defense \nlawyer was the\u0014\n                      infamous Clarence Darrow, and his most dramatic \nappeal was\u0014\n                      to argue that Leopold had absorbed the ideas of \nNietzsche at\u0014\n                      school. \"Your Honor,\" he said, \"it is hardly \nfair to hang a\u0014\n                      19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was \ntaught him at the\u0014\n                      university.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In both cases, of course, the murderers were \naccountable for\u0014\n                      their actions. Yet the Littleton killers were \nacting out the\u0014\n                      logical consequences of a postmodernism taught \ntoday from\u0014\n                      university to grade school. They were mirroring \nin grotesque\u0014\n                      action what the adult culture advocates in \nabstract concepts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Francis Schaeffer taught a method of \npre-evangelism that\u0014\n                      presses people to the logical consequences of \ntheir own\u0014\n                      beliefs. Littleton illustrates what Nietzsche's \nphilosophy leads\u0014\n                      to when lived out in the real world. It is one \nthing to debate the\u0014\n                      topic in a rarefied academic setting; it's \nquite another when a\u0014\n                      Nazi-quoting teenager sticks a gun in your \nface. Suddenly,\u0014\n                      you realize that world-views do matter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Littleton also brought into bold relief the \ncontrast between\u0014\n                      Nietzsche's legacy and the Christian \nworld-view. The killers\u0014\n                      harbored a fierce hatred of Christianity. At \nleast three victims\u0014\n                      were asked directly, \"Do you believe in God?\" \nand when they\u0014\n                      answered \"yes\" were shot on the spot. By now \nthese teens\u0014\n                      have become heroesCassie Bernall, who was \nlater found\u0014\n                      with her hands still clasped in prayer; Valeen \nSchnurr, who\u0014\n                      was hospitalized with 9 bullets in her body; \nRachel Scott,\u0014\n                      who answered \"yes\" and the killer said, \"Then \ngo be with him\u0014\n                      now\" and shot her in the head. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Who can forget the news photos of crosses on \nthe hill for the\u0014\n                      slain? Or the interviews with Christian parents \noffering\u0014\n                      forgiveness and reconciliation? Or the funeral \nservices\u0014\n                      broadcasting the gospel message across the \nnation? I cannot\u0014\n                      remember any event in recent years that \nproduced such\u0014\n                      stunning Christian testimony. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      God is not mocked. A vicious attack on his \npeople was\u0014\n                      turned into a powerful demonstration of faith \novercoming evil.\u0014\n                      These teens are inspiring others. Across the \ncountry, youth\u0014\n                      pastors are reporting revivals. At Cassie \nBernall's church\u0014\n                      alone, attendance is up by 500 people. Time \nmagazine even\u0014\n                      ran a two-page spread on the stunning revival \namong teens. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Littleton brought us face to face with two \nworld-views\u0014\n                      competing for our allegiancea postmodernism \nrooted in the\u0014\n                      will to power contrasted with a biblical faith \nrooted in the will\u0014\n                      of God. Which will America choose? The reports \nof spreading\u0014\n                      revival suggest that many are now ready to make \nthe right\u0014\n                      choice. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1999 by the author or Christianity \nToday\u0014\n                      International/Christianity Today magazine. \u0014\n                      August 9, 1999 Vol. 43, No. 9, Page 80\u0014",

But two caveats \nare essential:\u0014\n                      this is not just a lively new version of \nliberal process theology,\u0014\n                      nor is it merely a lively new version of \nevangelical Arminian\u0014\n                      theology. These authors set forth for the first \ntime a\u0014\n                      sustained, biblically based, rational argument \nthat the God of\u0014\n                      the Bible is with us in time and does not know \nthe future in\u0014\n                      absolute detail.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The new paradigm is variously called \"the open \nview of God,\"\u0014\n                      \"creative-love theism,\" and \"free-will theism.\" \nIt is radical\u0014\n                      Arminianismand morebut it stops short of \nprocess\u0014\n                      theology or Boston personalism (belief in a \nfinite God). The\u0014\n                      authors claim that their model of God is not an\u0014\n                      accommodation to modern thought or \nsensibilities but is\u0014\n                      thoroughly grounded in the synoptic vision of \nthe God who\u0014\n                      reveals himself in the Bible. It is a \nHebrew-Christian model of\u0014\n                      God stripped of the deleterious effects of \nNeo-Platonism and\u0014\n                      other Hellenistic philosophies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      According to free-will theism, \"history is the \ncombined result\u0014\n                      of what God and his creatures decide to do,\" \nand its God is\u0014\n                      \"always walking beside us, experiencing what we \nare\u0014\n                      experiencing when we are experiencing it, \nalways willing to\u0014\n                      help to the extent consistent with our status \nas responsible\u0014\n                      creations of his.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How does this differ from process theology's \n\"fellow sufferer\u0014\n                      who understands\"? The authors of The Openness \nof God go\u0014\n                      to great lengths to show that it differs \nprofoundly. Unlike the\u0014\n                      God of Alfred North Whitehead and other process \nthinkers,\u0014\n                      free-will theism's God is omnipotent in the \nclassical sense:\u0014\n                      able to do anything that is consistent with his \nown nature and\u0014\n                      logic. In other words, the God of creative-love \ntheism is the\u0014\n                      absolute ground and source of all creation \n(creatio ex nihilo)\u0014\n                      and could control his creatures if he wished to \ndo so, but he\u0014\n                      chooses not to control by coercion or force, \ninstead\u0014\n                      influencing by persuasion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      De-Hellenizing God\u0014\n                      The overall argument of The Openness of God is \nthat\u0014\n                      Christian theology has been falsely polarized. \nFor centuries,\u0014\n                      the doctrine of God (which the authors consider \nfoundational)\u0014\n                      has been held captive to classical theism, which\u0014\n                      overemphasizes God's transcendence and neglects \nGod's\u0014\n                      Trinitarian personhood. The effect has been a \ntheology of\u0014\n                      meticulous providence in which God is supposed \nto control all\u0014\n                      eventsincluding the original Fall and its \nconsequent sin and\u0014\n                      evil. The authors argue that this is simply \ninconsistent with\u0014\n                      the overall picture of God given in revelation: \na God who\u0014\n                      repents, grieves, and suffers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the other hand, too many theologians have \nthought that\u0014\n                      the only alternative to the God of classical \ntheism is a finite\u0014\n                      God such as process theology promotes. The \nauthors argue\u0014\n                      that process theology's God is also \ninconsistent with the\u0014\n                      overall picture of God given in revelation. \nThat God intervenes\u0014\n                      powerfully and will bring history to a \nconclusion in his\u0014\n                      kingdomwith or without human help.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pinnock, professor of theology at McMaster \nDivinity College,\u0014\n                      Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and his coauthors \nmake a\u0014\n                      powerful case for their model of God. In the \nfirst chapter,\u0014\n                      \"Biblical Support for a New Perspective,\" \nRichard Rice,\u0014\n                      professor of theology at LaSierra University, \nRiverside,\u0014\n                      California, demonstrates convincingly that it \nis not possible\u0014\n                      simply to dismiss all biblical references to \nGod's \"repentance\"\u0014\n                      as anthropomorphisms. Under the rubric of \n\"Historical\u0014\n                      Considerations,\" John Sanders, instructor in \ntheology and\u0014\n                      philosophy at Oak Hills Bible College, Bemidji, \nMinnesota,\u0014\n                      argues persuasively that classical theism \nincludes unbiblical\u0014\n                      and possibly unorthodox concessions to pagan \nphilosophy.\u0014\n                      The real heart of the book is Pinnock's chapter \non systematic\u0014\n                      theology, which powerfully portrays the \npersonal God of the\u0014\n                      Bible as self-limiting for our sakes. The \nchapter entitled \"A\u0014\n                      Philosophical Perspective,\" by William Hasker, \nprofessor of\u0014\n                      philosophy at Huntington College, Huntington, \nIndiana, will be\u0014\n                      the most challenging for many readers; but for \nthose who\u0014\n                      persevere, it makes a strong case for the \nrational superiority\u0014\n                      of the theology of divine openness over \ncompeting ways of\u0014\n                      understanding God and his works. In the \nconcluding chapter,\u0014\n                      David Basinger, professor of theology at \nRoberts Wesleyan\u0014\n                      College, Rochester, New York, shows the \npractical appeal of\u0014\n                      free-will theism for ordinary Christian \nspirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The authors do not hide their philosophical \npresuppositions.\u0014\n                      Readers who cannot agree with these foundational\u0014\n                      assumptions will have trouble accepting \nfree-will theism. Two\u0014\n                      basic ones are that logical \ncontradictionsincluding so-called\u0014\n                      paradoxes or antinomiesare illegitimate in \ntheology as\u0014\n                      elsewhere and that freedom means being able to \ndo\u0014\n                      otherwise. While the authors are not \nrationalists in the strict\u0014\n                      sense of that word, they clearly place high \nvalue on\u0014\n                      coherence. That is, truth claims about God that \ninvolve logical\u0014\n                      contradictions are literally nonsense and \nshould not be\u0014\n                      accepted in theology any more than in any area \nof intellectual\u0014\n                      endeavor. Therefore, one cannot say both that \nGod knows the\u0014\n                      whole future in absolute detail with absolute \ncertainty and that\u0014\n                      part of it is still open and undetermined (such \nas individuals'\u0014\n                      decisions regarding salvation).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The second presupposition of free-will theism \nis that true\u0014\n                      freedom means being able to choose between \noptions without\u0014\n                      any predetermination. This is called a \nnoncompatibilist idea of\u0014\n                      freedom. It is not compatible with determinism \nor\u0014\n                      predestination. It assumes and requires a \ncertain limited\u0014\n                      independence of the creature from God. Many\u0014\n                      evangelicalsespecially Calvinistsprefer a \ncompatibilist\u0014\n                      idea of freedom. For them, true freedom is \nbeing able to do\u0014\n                      what God knows and decides is right. \nIndependence from\u0014\n                      God in any degree is lack of freedom. Of \ncourse, proponents\u0014\n                      of the free-will theism paradigm will object \nthat this is an odd,\u0014\n                      even unique, use of freedom, quite unlike that \nword's meaning\u0014\n                      in ordinary speech, and that it ultimately \nlands one in\u0014\n                      incoherence unless one is willing to say God is \nthe author of\u0014\n                      sin and evil.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A test for how we disagree\u0014\n                      The Openness of God is a powerful and \npersuasive book. It is\u0014\n                      creative, bold, and Bible based. In spite of \nits strengths,\u0014\n                      however, a few serious problems remain that \nwill hinder even\u0014\n                      some sympathetic readers from wholeheartedly \nembracing\u0014\n                      the model argued for. The authors deal \ninadequately with two\u0014\n                      major issues. They assert that part and parcel \nof the open\u0014\n                      view of God is belief that God does not know \nfuture free\u0014\n                      decisions and actions of his creatures. They \nstruggle\u0014\n                      mightily, and with some success, to show that \nthis in no way\u0014\n                      impairs belief in God's ultimate sovereignty \nand power over\u0014\n                      the outcome of human history. But a shadow of \ndoubt lingers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Can a risk-taking, self-limiting God who \nrarely, if ever,\u0014\n                      intervenes in the free choices and actions of \nhuman agents\u0014\n                      know that history will end the way he envisions \nand predicts\u0014\n                      without having to rob free creatures of their \nfreedom? It would\u0014\n                      seem that for history to end in the kingdom of \nGod, as these\u0014\n                      authors insist it will, God will have to \nexercise more than\u0014\n                      loving, influencing, persuasive power. While it \nis consistent\u0014\n                      with their theology to believe God will do that \nin order to\u0014\n                      establish his kingdom, the question arises, Why \nbelieve he\u0014\n                      never or hardly ever does that on the way to \nthe kingdom?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A closely related question concerns God's \nbeliefs and\u0014\n                      predictions about the future. The authors do \nnot deal\u0014\n                      adequately with the question of whether God can \nhold false\u0014\n                      beliefs about the future. At the very least, \nthey must hold that\u0014\n                      God predicts the outcome of historical \nprocesses involving\u0014\n                      free agents. Could God's predictions turn out \nto be wrong?\u0014\n                      When Jesus told Peter that he would deny him, \nis it even\u0014\n                      theoretically possible that Peter might not \nhave denied him?\u0014\n                      Either way the authors (and other advocates of \nlimited divine\u0014\n                      foreknowledge) answer this question presents \nthem with\u0014\n                      some problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I am not arguing that these are insuperable \ndifficulties; the\u0014\n                      authors may have satisfactory solutions. For \nmany readers\u0014\n                      warmly attracted to their model of God, \nhowever, these\u0014\n                      doubts will preclude their wholehearted \nacceptance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, the open view of God raises many \nquestions, and\u0014\n                      these will no doubt be extensively explored and \ndebated in\u0014\n                      reviews, panel discussions, and even \nbook-length responses.\u0014\n                      One question it raises that should underlie \neverything else is\u0014\n                      this: How do American evangelical Christians \nhandle\u0014\n                      theological diversity? Have we come of age \nenough to avoid\u0014\n                      heresy charges and breast-beating jeremiads in \nresponse to a\u0014\n                      new doctrinal proposal that is so \nconscientiously based on\u0014\n                      biblical reflection rather than on rebellious \naccommodation to\u0014\n                      modern thought? This may be the test.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Roger Olson is professor of theology at Bethel \nCollege, Saint\u0014\n                      Paul, Minnesota, and editor of The Christian \nScholar's Review.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Afraid of Infinitude\u0014\n                      By Douglas F. Kelly\u0014\n                      One of the best things about this most \nprovocative book is its\u0014\n                      subject: it is actually about God, rather than \nbeing another\u0014\n                      evangelical \"how to\" or self-help manual. Clark \nPinnock is\u0014\n                      certainly right about one thing: \"The concept \nof God is the\u0014\n                      most important topic in theology.\" To their \ncredit, the five\u0014\n                      authors have done something far from universal \namong\u0014\n                      theologians and philosophers; they have written \nin clear,\u0014\n                      straightforward English prose. It seems to me \nthat they have\u0014\n                      been honest and aboveboard in plainly \nexpressing what they\u0014\n                      think. Even those who strongly disagree with \ntheir\u0014\n                      conclusions will have to respect them for their \ntransparent\u0014\n                      clarity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Moreover, one must commend their desire to make \ntheir\u0014\n                      theological discourse practical so that it \naddresses living\u0014\n                      issues such as the reality of intercessory \nprayer, and how to\u0014\n                      interpret evil and fight it in today's world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Several of these authors properly point out \nthat the classical\u0014\n                      tradition has not always done full exegetical, \ntheological\u0014\n                      justice to the matter of God's impassability. I \nwas genuinely\u0014\n                      disappointed that, because of crucial, \nexegetical and central\u0014\n                      theological weaknesses, these brethren were \nunable to\u0014\n                      improve this situation. Indeed, what they have \nto say on this\u0014\n                      point and many others constitutes one of the \nsaddest\u0014\n                      intellectual and spiritual retrogressions I \nhave ever seen\u0014\n                      outside openly heterodox thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The really crucial weakness that devastates the \npromise of\u0014\n                      this volume to present a fresh, more biblical \nview of God is\u0014\n                      this: The authors feel that God cannot be \ninfinite and personal\u0014\n                      at the same time. To deal with us personally, \nrather than\u0014\n                      harshly and mechanically (which is how they see\u0014\n                      \"sovereignty\"), God either must be finite or, \nat least, refrain\u0014\n                      from employing such infinitude. Some of the \nauthors hold that\u0014\n                      God really is not infinite (e.g., God literally \ndoes not know\u0014\n                      what is future); some of them suggest that he \nmust voluntarily\u0014\n                      refuse to use his infinite abilities as the \nprice of humankind's\u0014\n                      being guaranteed personal significance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As a result of a selective biblical exegesis \n(that looks only at\u0014\n                      the human limitations implied in a wordsuch as\u0014\n                      repentand strangely fails to consider the word \nin the light of\u0014\n                      the infinite subject to whom it refers) and a \nfailure actually to\u0014\n                      read the Fathers of the Christian church, these \nwriters\u0014\n                      attempt to get rid of God's infinity by \nascribing it to classical\u0014\n                      theology's being the illegitimate offspring of \nthe cohabitation of\u0014\n                      biblical concepts with pagan Hellenistic \nphilosophy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In reality, a careful reading of the Fathers \n(such as\u0014\n                      Athanasius, for instance) would indicate the \nprofound\u0014\n                      Christianization of Hellenistic terms and \nconcepts. Though\u0014\n                      they began as Greek terms conveying pagan \ncontent, such\u0014\n                      concepts as creation, being, logos, providence, \nand person\u0014\n                      were thoroughly transformed during the first \nfour or five\u0014\n                      centuries of the Christian era in the light of \nOld Testament\u0014\n                      prophecy and the apostolic testimony to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps lack of familiarity with this field of \nstudy explains why\u0014\n                      the authors dismiss so easily the entire \nclassical tradition as\u0014\n                      being no less Neo-Platonic than \nPseudo-Dionysius, who in\u0014\n                      truly unbiblical fashion describes God as \n\"beyond being.\" But\u0014\n                      they fail to point out the very significant \nfact that when\u0014\n                      Athanasius (long before the time of \nPseudo-Dionysius) quotes\u0014\n                      this passage from Plato's Republic, he changes \nit to state\u0014\n                      that God is \"beyond all created being\"a \nprofoundly biblical\u0014\n                      concept (Athanasius, Contra Gentes, 2.2;40.2). \nThis leads us\u0014\n                      to the heart of their problem.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It seems to me that these \"openness\" writers \nhave failed to\u0014\n                      think through the profound implications of the \ndifference\u0014\n                      between created (finite) being and uncreated \n(infinite) being.\u0014\n                      This failure to think clearly is manifestly \ndemonstrated in their\u0014\n                      impoverished grasp of the relationship of \nlanguage to being\u0014\n                      (i.e., epistemology). They seem to work on the \nassumption of\u0014\n                      the univocal validity of language for both God \nand man. That\u0014\n                      is, a word must mean for God the exact same \nthing it does\u0014\n                      for a human.

A brief\u0014\n                      reading of a few sections of Saint Thomas \nAquinas's Summa\u0014\n                      Theologiae or perhaps chapter five of E. L. \nMascall's\u0014\n                      Existence and Analogy might have transformed \nthis book.\u0014\n                      And long before Aquinas or Mascall, Saint \nHilary of Poitiers\u0014\n                      (fourth century) wisely remarked (in De \nTrinitate 4:14) that\u0014\n                      human words are subject to God, rather than God \nbeing\u0014\n                      subject to human words (in the sense of \ncomprehensively\u0014\n                      defined and thus limited by them). The human \nmind \"must not\u0014\n                      measure the divine nature by the limitations of \n[its] own, but\u0014\n                      must gauge God's assertions concerning himself \nby the scale\u0014\n                      of his own glorious self-revelation.  Since we \nare to\u0014\n                      discourse of the things of God, let us assume \nthat God has\u0014\n                      full knowledge of himself, and bow with humble \nreverence to\u0014\n                      his words\" (1:17).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In other words, the reason the five authors of \nThe Openness\u0014\n                      of God deny the infinitude of nearly all the \nattributes of God is\u0014\n                      their failure to have heard what Hilary (and \nthe whole orthodox\u0014\n                      Christian tradition) could have said to them. \nThat is, we must\u0014\n                      not attempt to project our creaturely \nlimitations onto the God\u0014\n                      who made us (as though we had made him). That \nwould be a\u0014\n                      violation of the second commandment. Rather, \nwith Saint\u0014\n                      Paul, let us understand that the analogy (and \nglorious reality)\u0014\n                      of God as our Father makes sense because \nfatherhood is\u0014\n                      from God (Eph. 3:14-15), as the incarnate \nChrist and\u0014\n                      outpoured Spirit have shown us. Hence, as \nAthanasius says,\u0014\n                      \"God does not make man his pattern, but rather, \nsince God\u0014\n                      alone is properly and truly Father, we men are \ncalled fathers\u0014\n                      of our own children, for of him every \nfatherhood in heaven and\u0014\n                      earth is named\" (Contra Arianos 1:23).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Human reason, therefore, must adjust itself to \nGod's being\u0014\n                      and not the reverse. Repeatedly in this volume, \nthe authors\u0014\n                      univocally limit the infinite God by what they \nare able to\u0014\n                      understand (see, for example, the definition of \ndivine\u0014\n                      omniscience on p. 136). This short-sighted \nprocedure causes\u0014\n                      them throughout the book to deny one side of \nclear biblical\u0014\n                      teaching (such as God's sovereignty) in order \nto affirm the\u0014\n                      other side (such as human responsibility). \nSadly, all too little\u0014\n                      that they write in this volume can be taken \nseriously either by\u0014\n                      scholars or by ordinary Christian layfolk until \nits authors\u0014\n                      rethink their basic approach.

If that were \never true, the\u0014\n                      present volume indicates that it is no longer \nso. The\u0014\n                      revisionist view of God set forth here is \nneither new nor all that\u0014\n                      radical compared to other models one can \nencounter at, say,\u0014\n                      nearly any session of the American Academy of \nReligion.\u0014\n                      What is significant is that this book claims to \nbe a \"biblical\u0014\n                      challenge\" to the traditional understanding of \nGod by a team\u0014\n                      of scholars well known for their contributions \nto evangelical\u0014\n                      journals and learned societies. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      These essays are really a form of protest \nliterature. The\u0014\n                      authors claim to have found the classical \ndoctrine of God,\u0014\n                      which presumably each of them once affirmed, to \nbe\u0014\n                      apologetically inhibiting, religiously \nstultifying, and just plain\u0014\n                      old-fashioned. But their analysis is based on \nthree false\u0014\n                      dichotomies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      First, they pit the dynamic, interactive God of \nthe Hebrew\u0014\n                      Scriptures over against the static, \ntranscendent God of the\u0014\n                      Greek philosophers. This contrast was given \ndefinitive form by\u0014\n                      Adolf von Harnack, who saw the Trinitarian and \nChristological\u0014\n                      consensus of the early church as the ultimate \ncorruption by\u0014\n                      the alien spirit of Hellenism of the primitive \ntruth of the gospel.\u0014\n                      To this G. L. Prestige responded wisely, \"The \nChristian\u0014\n                      doctrine of God is a legitimate rational \nconstruction founded\u0014\n                      on the facts of Christian experience.\" To be \nsure, the church\u0014\n                      Fathers did use contemporary thought forms and \neven new\u0014\n                      words such as Trinitas and homoousios, but they \ndid so\u0014\n                      precisely in order to be faithful to the living \nGod of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theologians should indeed beware of the \nseduction of\u0014\n                      philosophy. Augustine could not remain a pure \nNeo-Platonist\u0014\n                      once he became a Christian. Luther, among \nothers, protested\u0014\n                      against Aristotle's undue influence. But the \nso-called open\u0014\n                      God is himself shaped by philosophical bias, \nnamely, a\u0014\n                      process view of reality that has far less \nbiblical warrant than\u0014\n                      the classical metaphysical tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, they posit the God of love over against \nthe God of\u0014\n                      power. Yet the same New Testament book that \ndeclares\u0014\n                      \"God is love\" also proclaims \"God is light\" (1 \nJohn 4:16; 1:5),\u0014\n                      a reference both to God's holiness and his \neternal effulgence.\u0014\n                      It is not necessary to trivialize the noetic \nand ontic effects of\u0014\n                      sin, nor to minimize the penal and \nsubstitutionary sufferings\u0014\n                      of Christ in order to magnify the gracious, \nall-loving character\u0014\n                      of God. Nor should God's immutability be \ninterpreted as his\u0014\n                      immobility.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The orthodox doctrine of God affirms both his \ninfinite power\u0014\n                      and his sovereign love. No less a defender of \ntraditional\u0014\n                      theism than Charles Hodge wrote: \"Love of \nnecessity involves\u0014\n                      feeling, and if there be no feeling in God, \nthere can be no\u0014\n                      love.\" The God of the Bible is both personal \nand all-powerful, a\u0014\n                      God of covenant relations with his people, and \nyet utterly\u0014\n                      fulfilled within his own dynamic, Trinitarian \nlife. How could\u0014\n                      Luther, Calvin, even Arminius, accept the \nformer but fail to\u0014\n                      \"see the conflict\" with the latter? Perhaps it \nwas because\u0014\n                      they served a greater, richer, more complex and \nless\u0014\n                      threatened God than one devised for modern \nsensibilities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Third, they deny that God's knowledge of future \ncontingents\u0014\n                      can be squared with freely chosen acts. But \ndivine\u0014\n                      foreknowledge need not negate human \nresponsibility; indeed,\u0014\n                      as Karl Barth noted, divine foreknowledge is the\u0014\n                      \"presupposition of its possibility,\" denoting \nas it does the\u0014\n                      absolute priority and superiority of God \nhimself to every\u0014\n                      possible existence distinct from his own.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the view presented here, God cannot really \nknow anything\u0014\n                      at all that will come to pass in the future; \nhis knowledge is\u0014\n                      limited to the present and the past. This \nreduces biblical\u0014\n                      prophecy to wishful thinking, albeit divine \nwishful thinking. It\u0014\n                      also forces the authors to opt for the \"oops \ntheory\" of\u0014\n                      salvation history. If Plan A fails, go to Plan \nB. And it leaves\u0014\n                      them little to say about eschatology, except \nfor the vague\u0014\n                      hope that somehow good will triumph over evil. \nBut the \"open\u0014\n                      God\" cannot guarantee that it will. He can only \nstruggle with\u0014\n                      us against the chaos and keep on trying harder. \nOne might\u0014\n                      feel sorry for such a God, even sympathize with \nhim in his\u0014\n                      cosmic battle against the power of darkness. \nBut one would\u0014\n                      hardly be moved to fall down and worship such \nan attenuated,\u0014\n                      transcendence-starved deity. The \"open God\" is \na long way\u0014\n                      from the awesome, holy, unsurprisable (yet \never-surprising)\u0014\n                      God of the Bible, the God who \"is a consuming \nfire.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The authors of this book are my brothers in \nChrist. They have\u0014\n                      presented their views with earnestness and \nsincerity, even\u0014\n                      humility, rightly recognizing that God is far \ngreater than our\u0014\n                      best efforts to describe him. I applaud their \ndesire to submit\u0014\n                      every doctrine, including the most cherished \nand time-worn\u0014\n                      ones, to the searching light of God's written \nWord. But in their\u0014\n                      desire to defend \"God's reputation,\" and to \nconstruct\u0014\n                      \"plausible models\" and \"convincing conceptions\" \nthat would\u0014\n                      make it easier \"to invite people to find \nfulfillment,\" they have\u0014\n                      devised a user-friendly God who bears an uncanny\u0014\n                      resemblance to a late-twentieth-century seeker. \nThey need\u0014\n                      not be so concerned about \"God's reputation.\" \nThey only\u0014\n                      need to let God be God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Timothy George is dean of Beeson Divinity \nSchool at Samford\u0014\n                      University, Birmingham, Alabama.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whatever Happened to Luther?\u0014\n                      By Alister E. McGrath\u0014\n                      The contributors to this volume want to purge \nevangelicalism\u0014\n                      of the ideas of classical theism and return to \nwhat they see\u0014\n                      as more biblical ideas. This project is hardly \nnew; after all, an\u0014\n                      integral element of Martin Luther's theological \nprogram was to\u0014\n                      do just that (especially ridding theology of \nAristotle's\u0014\n                      influence). Luther's theology of the Cross \nrepresents a classic\u0014\n                      approach to this issue, which European \nevangelicals have\u0014\n                      found of enormous value as we try to ensure that\u0014\n                      evangelicalism remains faithful to Scripture in \nits portrayal of\u0014\n                      God. Luther's superb discussion of the \nsuffering of God\u0014\n                      remains firmly linked with Scripture and shows \na degree of\u0014\n                      Christological sophistication that leaves many \nof us\u0014\n                      breathless with admiration. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A quick read of this volume, however, showed \nthat the\u0014\n                      contributors seem not to realize that Luther \nhas been down\u0014\n                      their road long before them. This alarmed me. \nWhy should we\u0014\n                      trust clarion calls to modify the evangelical \ntradition if the\u0014\n                      critics are not familiar with it?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is in John Sanders's chapter on \"Historical \nConsiderations\"\u0014\n                      that the problem is made most evident. There he \nsurveys how\u0014\n                      the \"Greek metaphysical system 'boxed up' the \nGod\u0014\n                      described in the Bible.\" Yet the survey Sanders \npresents is\u0014\n                      derivative, based on secondary literature. And \nwhen we come\u0014\n                      to Luther, the results become uncomfortably \nclear. Sanders's\u0014\n                      entire discussion of Luther is based on one \nreference to Paul\u0014\n                      Althaus's Theology of Martin Luther (1963), one \nreference to a\u0014\n                      general work on the theology of providence, and \na single\u0014\n                      quote from the 1525 work Th\u0014",

Is \nrock singer Bob Dylanwho\u0014\n                      reportedly became a Christian in 1979still a \nChristian? Has he returned to\u0014\n                      Judaism, the religion of his childhood? Or is \nhe simply a seeker of truth who\u0014\n                      doesn't fully commit himself to any one \nreligion?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan might put an end to such speculation \nduring this summer's 1984 Olympic\u0014\n                      Games. He has been asked to participate in an \nOlympics evangelistic\u0014\n                      outreach. The singer has not given a firm \nanswer. But according to Paul\u0014\n                      Emond, a former pastor who is a friend of \nDylan, the singer is considering the\u0014\n                      invitation. As entertainment chairman for the \nOlympics Outreach Working\u0014\n                      Committee, Emond asked Dylan to be a part of \nthe mass evangelistic effort.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"He had a thousand opportunities to say, 'Look, \nPaul, that's just not my bag\u0014\n                      anymore. Don't you get the hint?',\" Emond says. \n\"That's not where he's\u0014\n                      coming from at all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Emond says he helped lead Dylan to Christ in \n1979, the year Dylan's songs\u0014\n                      took a decidedly Christian turn. The album he \nreleased later that year, Slow\u0014\n                      Train Coming, contained a clear Christian \nmessageas did his 1980 and 1981\u0014\n                      releases.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Christian proclamations were significant \nbecause of Dylan's reputation as\u0014\n                      a musical prophet to the sixties generation. He \nburst into stardom during the\u0014\n                      mid-1960s with songs such as \"Blowin' in the \nWind,\" \"The Times They Are\u0014\n                      A-Changin',\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man.\" Many of \nhis songs were critical of\u0014\n                      American society and U.S. government policy. \nThe singer's music helped\u0014\n                      shape the world view of American youth entering \na period of public protests\u0014\n                      against the Vietnam War.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Because his fans were unaccustomed to hearing \nhim praise God, Dylan's\u0014\n                      statements of faith in 1979 immediately came \nunder fire. After Slow Train\u0014\n                      Coming was released, Rolling Stone magazine \nsaid the album's biblical\u0014\n                      references were nothing more than a \ncontinuation of Dylan's familiar use of\u0014\n                      religious imagery. In 1982, New York magazine \nquoted an unnamed source\u0014\n                      who said Dylan had never forsaken Judaism for \nChristianity. Time and\u0014\n                      Newsweek last year published a photograph of \nDylanwearing a yarmulke,\u0014\n                      prayer shawl, and phylacteriesat Jerusalem's \nWailing Wall. (The rock singer\u0014\n                      was in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Emond says Dylan is regularly misrepresented in \nthe media. For example, he\u0014\n                      says it is wrong to conclude that Dylan's \nparticipation in a bar mitzvah means\u0014\n                      he is embracing Judaism. According to Emond, \nDylan's bar mitzvah appearance\u0014\n                      merely underscores the singer's understanding \nof the proper relationship\u0014\n                      between Old Testament faith and New Testament \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I don't think he ever left his Jewish roots,\" \nEmond says. \"I think he was one\u0014\n                      of those fortunate ones who realized that \nJudaism and Christianity can work\u0014\n                      very well together, because Christ is just \nYeshua ha'Meshiah [Jesus the\u0014\n                      Messiah]. And so he doesn't have any problems \nabout putting on a yarmulke\u0014\n                      and going to a bar mitzvah, because he can \nrespect that. And the]\u0014\n                      recognizes that maybe those people themselves \nwill recognize who Yeshua\u0014\n                      ha'Meshiah is one of these days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others interpret Dylan's ties with Judaism \ndifferently. His meetings last year\u0014\n                      with Hasidic Jews caused some to wonder if he \nwas returning to Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"He's been going in and out of a lot of things, \ntrying to find himself,\" says\u0014\n                      Rabbi Kasriel Kastel, of the Brooklyn Lubavitch \ncenter. \"And we've just been\u0014\n                      making ourselves available.\" The Lubavitch \nmovement tries to renew the\u0014\n                      commitment of inactive Jews through education. \nDylan studied with Lubavitch\u0014\n                      members while he was in New York to record his \nlatest album, Infidels.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Kastel says he doesn't believe Dylan ever \nforsook his Jewish faith to become a\u0014\n                      Christian. \"As far as we're concerned, he was a \nconfused Jew. We feel he's\u0014\n                      coming back.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Emond acknowledges that Dylan has met with \nHasidic Jews. But he says it\u0014\n                      wasn't out of a desire to return to the Jewish \nfaith. Emond says the meetings\u0014\n                      took place at the request of members of the \nLubavitch movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"They can't take the fact that he (Dylan) was \nable to come to the discovery\u0014\n                      of his Messiah as being Jesus,\" Emond says. \n\"Jews always look at their own\u0014\n                      people as traitors when they come to that kind \nof faith.  When one of their\u0014\n                      important figures is 'led astray,' they're \ngoing to do everything they can to\u0014\n                      get him back again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Kastel denies that his group is trying to \ntake advantage of Dylan. \"We\u0014\n                      don't want anyone to feel that he's being used \nin any way, which he's very\u0014\n                      sensitive to. So we're keeping this very, very \nlow key.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For his part, Dylan isn't doing much to quell \nthe debate. He does not grant\u0014\n                      many interviews, and Christianity Today was \nunable to contact him. When he\u0014\n                      does grant interviews, his statements often are \nambiguous.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Los Angeles Times last year quoted him as \nsaying he did not regret\u0014\n                      \"telling people how to get their souls saved.\" \nBut he added, \"Now it's time for\u0014\n                      me to do something else.  Jesus himself only \npreached for three years.\" The\u0014\n                      Washington Post quoted him as saying he \nbelieves in reincarnation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In those articles as in others, Emond says, \nDylan was misrepresented. \"I know\u0014\n                      he doesn't believe in it [reincarnation], so it \nmust have been taken out of\u0014\n                      context or misinterpreted. They [writers] can \ntake what he says, if they\u0014\n                      want, and make it sound pretty bad, depending \non what questions they're\u0014\n                      asking and how many words they leave out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan has said he lets his songs speak for him. \nBut his latest album doesn't\u0014\n                      shed much light on his spiritual loyalties. The \nsongs on the album make\u0014\n                      generous use of biblical imagery, but they make \nno clear declarations of faith.\u0014\n                      The absence of a Christian message leads some \nto wonder if the singer's\u0014\n                      spiritual commitment has waned.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such speculation leads Emond to criticize the \nchurch for passing judgment on\u0014\n                      Dylan. \"If the Christians spent as much time \npraying for guys like Bob as they\u0014\n                      do talking or speculating on him, then we \nwouldn't have these Christians like\u0014\n                      Bob that don't come out as boldly as we might \nlike them to.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I'm not saying that he's right in everything, \nbecause if I was in his position I\u0014\n                      would want to really capitalize on (his \nreputation as a vehicle for the gospel).\u0014\n                      And maybe that's in fact what he is doing, and \nhe just has a different way of\u0014\n                      going about things.\" If Dylan uses his musical \ntalent to share the gospel during\u0014\n                      this summer's Olympics, the speculation of the \nskeptics may be quieted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This article originally appeared in the January \n13, 1984, issue of Christianity\u0014\n                      Today, in the news section.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today magazine.\u0014\n                      Click here for reprint information on \nChristianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "How The \nInternet Began.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn old, bearded shepherd with a crooked staff walked up to a stone  \npulpit and said, \"And\u0014\nlo, it came to pass that the trader by the name of  Abraham Com did \ntake unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot.\u0014\n\u0014\n  And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.\u0014\nIndeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham,\u0014\nher  husband, \"Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy\u0014\ngoods  when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags\u0014\nshort  of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, Dear?\" And Dot \nreplied, \"I\u0014\nwill  place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send \nmessages\u0014\nsaying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which \nhath\u0014\nthe best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery \nmade\u0014\nby Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with  \nthe\u0014\ndrums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham \nsold\u0014\nall the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his\u0014\ntent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secret\u0014\nhimself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And\u0014\nthe young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy \nhorsefly\u0014\ntake to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich\u0014\nDominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the\u0014\ndeafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches \nwere\u0014\ngoing to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up\u0014\nevery drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums\u0014\nthat would work only if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken  \nover\u0014\nby others.\" And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as  \nit\u0014\ncame to be known \"eBay,\" he said, \"we need a name that reflects what \nwe\u0014\nare,\" and Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Whoopee !\", said Abraham.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, YAHOO!\" said Dot Com.. .and that is how it all began.\u0014\n\u0014\n It wasn't Al Gore after all.\u0014",

    "title": "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO THE DECLARATION",
    "words": "Historical Background to the Declaration\u0014\n\u0014\nBackground\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in \nPhiladelphia in\u0014\nthe Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall), approved the\u0014\nDeclaration of Independence. Its purpose was to set forth the \nprinciples\u0014\nupon which the Congress had acted two days earlier when it voted in \nfavor of\u0014\nRichard Henry Lee's motion to declare the freedom and independence of \nthe 13\u0014\nAmerican colonies from England. The Declaration was designed to \ninfluence\u0014\npublic opinion and gain support both among the new states and abroad \n--\u0014\nespecially in France, from which the new \"United States\" sought \nmilitary\u0014\nassistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Roger \nSherman and\u0014\nRobert R. Livingston comprised the committee charged with drafting the\u0014\nDeclaration, the task fell to Jefferson, regarded as the strongest \nand most\u0014\neloquent writer. The document is mainly his work, although the \ncommittee and\u0014\nCongress as a whole made a total of 86 changes to Jefferson's draft.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a scholar well-versed in the ideas and ideals of the French and \nEnglish\u0014\nEnlightenments, Jefferson found his greatest inspiration in the \nlanguage and\u0014\narguments of English philosopher John Locke, who had justified \nEngland's\u0014\n\"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 on the basis of man's \"natural rights.\"\u0014\nLocke's theory held that government was a contract between the \ngoverned and\u0014\nthose governing, who derived their power solely from the consent of \nthe\u0014\ngoverned and whose purpose it was to protect every man's inherent \nright to\u0014\nproperty, life and liberty. Jefferson's theory of \"natural law\" \ndiffered in\u0014\nthat it substituted the inalienable right of \"the pursuit of \nhappiness\" for\u0014\n\"property,\" emphasizing that happiness is the product of civic virtue \nand\u0014\npublic duty. The concept of the \"pursuit of happiness\" originated in \nthe\u0014\nCommon Sense School of Scottish philosophy, of which Lord Kames was \nthe\u0014\nbest-known proponent.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson emphasized the contractual justification for independence, \narguing\u0014\nthat when the tyrannical government of King George III of England \nrepeatedly\u0014\nviolated \"natural law, \" the colonists had not only the right but the \nduty\u0014\nto revolt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe assembled Continental Congress deleted a few passages of the \ndraft, and\u0014\namended others, but outright rejected only two sections: 1) a \nderogatory\u0014\nreference to the English people; 2) a passionate denunciation of the \nslave\u0014\ntrade. The latter section was left out, as Jefferson reported, to \naccede to\u0014\nthe wishes of South Carolina and Georgia, who wanted to continue the\u0014\nimportation of slaves. The rest of the draft was accepted on July 4, \nand 56\u0014\nmembers of Congress began their formal signing of the document on \nAugust 2,\u0014\n1776.\u0014\n\u0014\n>From the Library of Congress:\u0014",

    "title": "HOW PRAYER MADE ME A FATHER AGAIN",
    "words": "How Prayer Made Me a Father Again\u0014\n                      The surprising answer to my Tuesday night \nrequest \u0014\n\u0014\n                      by Richard Whetstone\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I can't begin to count the number of times that \nprayer has played an important part in my\u0014\n                      life. As often as God has answered my prayers, \nI realize it's important to pray for others,\u0014\n                      too. So when my church, Maranatha Assembly of \nGod, started a Tuesday night prayer\u0014\n                      service, I became a regular participant. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The pastor sometimes would begin with a short \ndevotion, and then we'd sing a couple of\u0014\n                      praise choruses before getting down to serious \nconversations with God. From the\u0014\n                      beginning, we knew we were there to pray. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During the first few months, attendance was \nsparse. Those who came gave their prayer\u0014\n                      requests and there'd still be plenty of time to \nbring them to the Lord. However, as\u0014\n                      prayers were answered, more people joined and \nthe number of requests multiplied. It\u0014\n                      took most of the service to hear all the \nrequests. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The pastor solved the problem with a sign-in \nsheet in the foyer. Now when we arrive for\u0014\n                      the service, we write down our prayer requests \non this sheet. During our praise time, the\u0014\n                      pastor makes a copy of these requests for each \nperson. With list in hand, we find a quiet\u0014\n                      place to pray individually. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Memories mixed with prayer\u0014\n                      One Tuesday early in 1997, attendance was \nunusually low and our prayer list was short.\u0014\n                      I prayed for each need listed. I prayed for the \nchurch, our community, our state, and our\u0014\n                      country. Then I prayed over the list again. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I looked at my watch thinking the hour ought to \nbe up. I still have 15 minutes left! There\u0014\n                      has to be something more I can pray about, I \nthought. As determined as I was to\u0014\n                      continue praying, my mind was blank. So I began \nreflecting on my personal life and\u0014\n                      praising God for all the blessings he had sent \nmy way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then my son came to mind. I had not seen Teddy \nfor 27 years. When he was less than a\u0014\n                      year old, his mother and I had divorced, and \nshe moved with Teddy out of state. I smiled\u0014\n                      to myself as I thought back to those months \nwith my firstborn son. I would get off the bus\u0014\n                      from work and could hear him crying half a \nblock away. As soon as I walked into his\u0014\n                      room, his cries turned into laughter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After the divorce, I made an effort to keep in \ntouch, but my first letters were returned\u0014\n                      unopened. Later they were marked, \"Addressee \nmoved, left no forwarding address.\" I\u0014\n                      had no idea where either Teddy or his mother \nlived. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Teddy was about five, I learned through an \nattorney that my ex-wife had remarried\u0014\n                      and her new husband wanted to adopt my son. I \nagonized over my decision. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The attorney wouldn't disclose Teddy's \nwhereabouts unless I chose to seek custodial\u0014\n                      rights. But a custody battle might forfeit any \nchance for Teddy to enjoy a stable life. I\u0014\n                      reasoned: Teddy doesn't know me. Would it \nreally be fair to deny him a father to satisfy\u0014\n                      my own need to see him? Would my selfishness \ncause more emotional damage? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I loved Teddy and missed him terribly, but I \ndecided I couldn't interfere with a chance for\u0014\n                      happiness in his life. I waived my rights, \nhoping it was the best thing to do for my son. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Please let me know my son\"\u0014\n                      Now, years later, I was kneeling before God \nrunning these things through my mind again.\u0014\n                      As I began praying, I didn't lament over my \nheartache. I didn't beg or plead with God to\u0014\n                      restore my son to me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I simply asked prayerfully, \"Lord, my son is a \ngrown man now. He is capable of making\u0014\n                      his own decisions, and there isn't much I could \ndo to interfere with his life. I love him and\u0014\n                      miss him. Please just let me know what kind of \na man Teddy has turned out to be.\u0014\n                      Anything more than that I leave in your hands. \nIn fact, Lord, I don't even know where to\u0014\n                      start looking for him, so I am truly leaving it \nall up to you. Please let me know my son.\u0014\n                      Amen.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As I left that prayer service, the Lord gave me \npeace from the words of Malachi 4:6\"He\u0014\n                      will turn the hearts of the fathers to their \nchildren, and the hearts of the children to their\u0014\n                      fathers.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                 Teddy's letter was\u0014\n                                              postmarked Wednesday,\u0014\n                                             the day after my Tuesday\u0014\n                                              night prayer. This \nwasn't\u0014\n                                                  a coincidence. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The rest of the week I went about my normal \nroutine and forgot about my prayer. But\u0014\n                      God hadn't forgotten. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Saturday after the prayer meeting, I ran \ninto our pastor at the post office. After I\u0014\n                      collected my mail from my box, we started to \nchat. As I scanned through my mail, a letter\u0014\n                      caught my eye. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I couldn't place the name or the return \naddress. As the pastor commented on Sunday's\u0014\n                      church activities, I started reading the \nmysterious letter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Are you okay?\" he asked me. Tears were rolling \ndown my face. I couldn't speak; I\u0014\n                      handed him the letter I had just readfrom \nTeddy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Teddy explained that he had decided to search \nthe Internet for me. This letter was one\u0014\n                      of 47 letters that my son had written to \nRichard Whetstones all over the country. Then I\u0014\n                      noticed the postmark: it was dated Wednesday, \nthe day after my Tuesday night prayer.\u0014\n                      This wasn't a coincidence. This was a direct \nanswer to my prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I told my wife Rose, she was excited \nbecause she had encouraged me to try to\u0014\n                      find Teddy. Since I hadn't mentioned my Tuesday \nnight prayer to her, she was even\u0014\n                      more thrilled when she learned the whole story. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A reunion for a reason\u0014\n                      I decided to call Teddy that day, but I was \nnervous as I dialed the phone number in\u0014\n                      Amarillo, Texas. When he answered the phone, I \nsaid I had received the letter and I was\u0014\n                      his father. (I later learned that Teddy thought \nthe call might be a prank.) We agreed to\u0014\n                      pursue the relationship further. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So I sat down and wrote him back, enclosing a \nphoto I had of hima color snapshot\u0014\n                      taken by a family friend at Teddy's \nchristening. In the photo, Teddy was in his mother's\u0014\n                      arms while my dad and I stood proudly beside \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Teddy's return letter, he enclosed the exact \nsame photothe only family photo he\u0014\n                      had! That was the confirmation we both needed. \nI had found my sonor rather, he\u0014\n                      found me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I told my sister Donna about Teddy, she \nbegan corresponding with him, secretly\u0014\n                      arranging a person-to-person reunion for the \ntwo of us at her wedding in May 1997.\u0014\n                      Teddy and I had time to slip away for \nbreakfast, then walked on the Clearwater beach,\u0014\n                      talking the whole time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Teddy had a lot of questions. He had had \nsuspicions about being adopted early on, but\u0014\n                      didn't learn the truth until he was 15 years \nold. His mother hadn't mentioned me at all; I\u0014\n                      was thankful she hadn't painted me as a \nterrible person. Having heard all kinds of horror\u0014\n                      stories about reunions that turned bad, once \nagain God remained faithful. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In October 1997, Teddy and his familywife \nDana, and their children Hayden and\u0014\n                      Jorden visited Rose and me in Florida. Teddy's \nwife couldn't get over how similar Teddy\u0014\n                      and I werein looks, mannerisms, speech, and \nidealseven though we lived completely\u0014\n                      separate lives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I had not been a Christian when Teddy was born. \nBut in 1980, I surrendered my life to\u0014\n                      Christ. When Rose and I were married in 1985, \nwe committed ourselves to making God\u0014\n                      the center of our marriage and home. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During Teddy's visit, he must have sensed \nsomething. Before he left, he said, \"When I\u0014\n                      get home, I need to get my family to church.\" \nTeddy has kept that promise, and I now can\u0014\n                      specifically pray for each of his family by \nname that God will work in their hearts and\u0014\n                      lives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      My Tuesday night prayer wasn't the first or the \nlast prayer that God has answered in my\u0014\n                      life. But it is one of the most wonderful and \nsatisfying blessings he has ever given me. All\u0014\n                      I did was simply ask, trusting for his answer. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A CHRISTIAN READER original article.\u0014",

    "words": "How Much Land Does A Man \nNeed?\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo Tolstoy once wrote a story about a successful peasant farmer who \nwas not\u0014\nsatisfied with his lot. He wanted more of everything. One day he \nreceived a\u0014\nnovel offer. For 1000 rubles, he could buy all the land he could walk \naround\u0014\nin a day. The only catch in the deal was that he had to be back at his\u0014\nstarting point by sundown. Early the next morning he started out \nwalking at\u0014\na fast pace. By midday he was very tired, but he kept going, covering \nmore\u0014\nand more ground. Well into the afternoon he realized that his greed \nhad\u0014\ntaken him far from the starting point. He quickened his pace and as \nthe sun\u0014\nbegan to sink low in the sky, he began to run, knowing that if he did \nnot\u0014\nmake it back by sundown the opportunity to become an even bigger \nlandholder\u0014\nwould be lost. As the sun began to sink below the horizon he came \nwithin\u0014\nsight of the finish line. Gasping for breath, his heart pounding, he \ncalled\u0014\nupon every bit of strength left in his body and staggered across the \nline\u0014\njust before the sun disappeared. He immediately collapsed, blood \nstreaming\u0014\nfrom his mouth. In a few minutes he was dead. Afterwards, his \nservants dug a\u0014\ngrave. It was not much over six feet long and three feet wide.

    "words": "Homosexuality \nand the Christian\u0014\n                                      By Jeremy Townsley, a \npracticing homosexual\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, let me say that I am an Evangelical Christian, committed to \nthe Lordship of Jesus Christ, his death, burial and\u0014\nresurrection, and our absolute need for Him for the forgiveness of \nour sins. Along with this is a commitment to the\u0014\nintegrity of Scripture--realizing the need to try to understand the \noriginal intent of the author as s/he was inspired by\u0014\nthe Holy Spirit, rather than trying to dismiss passages that don't \nconform to what I happen to want to believe. At the\u0014\nsame time, I am also gay and gay affirming. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, for those of you who have found your way to this site, I want \nthis to be a somewhat interactive place. If you\u0014\nhave anything productive, whether opposed to my position or in \nsupport of it, please post a message on the\u0014\nmessage board (Supplementary note: To see messages prior to March 15, \ngo to the old message board.\u0014\nCurrent messages are being posted in a new improved format, one which \naccomodates the larger message load.)\u0014\nThis list will be a continuing list for all who come here to see and \nlearn. \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that the Bible does not condemn monogamous long-term \nhomosexual relationships (see Addendum 1\u0014\nbelow for discussion on marriage, and Addendum 4 for a possible \nBiblical example of a gay marriage). There are a\u0014\nnumber of passages that allegedly refer to and condemn homosexuality. \nAs for the Old Testament passages (see\u0014\nAddendum 2 for an expanded explanation), I reject their application \nto the issue of homosexuality because they are\u0014\neither found contiguously with verses we wouldn't think of following \nanymore (abstaining from sex with a woman while\u0014\nshe is menstruating on pain of social and religious ex-communication: \nLev. 18.19-22, 20.13-18), they refer\u0014\nspecifically to temple prostitution (I Ki 14.24, 15.12--newer \ntranslations are now translating these Hebrew words as\u0014\n\"temple prostitute\", not \"homosexual\"), or they have nothing to do \nwith homosexuality to begin with (Gen 19-the\u0014\ndestruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, which we have no indication was \nrelated specifically to homosexuality, but to\u0014\nbehaviors such as those characterized by the mob that demanded that \nLot give up the men in his house so they\u0014\ncould gang-rape them).\u0014\n\u0014\nArsenokoitai and Malakoi (1 Co 6.9, 1 Tim 1.9-10)\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are only three New Testament passages relevant to the \ndiscussion. The first two represent cases of linguistic\u0014\nmistranslation: 1 Co 6.9 and 1 Tim 1.9-10. In these passages we are \ngiven the distinct impression in English\u0014\ntranslations that homosexuality is sin. However, the Greek words used \nhere are not a broad condemnation of all\u0014\nhomosexuality (see Addendum 3 for a more extensive analysis of Greek \nculture and homosexuality, and of\u0014\narsenokoitai). The first word, malakoi, is translated numerous ways: \neffeminate, male prostitute, catamite (a boy kept\u0014\nby a child molester) in other Greek literature. In fact, the literal \ntranslation of this word is \"soft\" and we have no idea\u0014\nwhat it means in this context (especially, since we find this word in \na \"list\" format, there is no real \"context\" from which\u0014\nto derive a meaning anyway). It could just as easily have been \ntranslated malleable, coward, sickly, lacking\u0014\nself-control or morally weak (in a general sense), none of which have \nany specific homosexual connotations (see\u0014\nHerodotus, Histories 7.153 and 13.51; Aristophanes Wasps 1455, Plutus \n488; Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics\u0014\n1150a:33; Plato, Republic 556c). It is found several other times in \nScripture, being translated as soft or fine referring\u0014\nto clothing in Matt 11:8 and Luke 7:25, and infirmity or malady in \nMatt 4:23, 9:35, and 10:1.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second word, arsenokoitai (see Addendum 3 for a more extensive \nanalysis of arsenokoitai), translated in the\u0014\nNIV as \"homosexual offenders\", is actually best translated as sexual \naggressor (with the connotations of a rapist of\u0014\nslave trader: see the following link to All TLG occurences of \narsenok*). This word is found in no extant Greek\u0014\nliterature prior to Paul's use here, which complicates our \nunderstanding of the word. The literal translation of this\u0014\ncompound word is (arsenos) male-bedders (koites), which could easily \nmean a man who sleeps around. The\u0014\nstrongest argument that leads one to believe that Paul was referring \nspecifically to general homosexuality is the\u0014\npossibility that Paul coined this term himself. If this is the case, \nthen he probably created this compound word from\u0014\nthe Septuagint (the ancient Greek version of the Old Testament) \ntranslation of Leviticus 20:13 (kai hos an\u0014\nkoime:the: meta arsenos koite:n gunaikos...). However, this passage \nrefers specifically to the holiness codes and\u0014\nthus probably implies some kind of ritual uncleanness (see Addendum 2 \non the Old Testament passages; and again,\u0014\nthis assumes both that he coined the term, and that he intended the \nterm to refer back to this passage, neither of\u0014\nwhich have strong evidence). Moreover, one wonders why, if Paul is \ngoing to go to the extent of creating a novel\u0014\nword to prohibit male homosexual behavior, why doesn't he, in the \nsame verse, create a complementary word\u0014\nprohibiting female homosexual behavior. The conspicuous absence of \nsuch a prohibition implies one of two things:\u0014\n1) If Paul is using the term arsenokoitai to refer to homosexual \nbehavior at all, he is not prohibiting all homosexual\u0014\nbehavior, only some type of male homosexual behavior that produced \nritual uncleanness in the mind of the first\u0014\ncentury church (unless he is allowing for female homosexual behavior, \nprohibiting only male homosexual behavior),\u0014\nor 2) he is, in fact, not referring to homosexuality at all in these \npassages. In either case, neither arsenokoitai nor\u0014\nmalakoi are justifiably translated as homosexual in any other Greek \nliterature, which makes one question why they\u0014\nare translated that way here.\u0014\nRomans 1.18-32: God's Wrath on Idolaters\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third passage of difficulty is Rom 1.26-27. This passage is not a \nsimple lexical problem, but is a contextual\u0014\nproblem. I come at this text in two ways. First, with the possibility \nthat this text cannot be understood in any way other\u0014\nthan condemning homosexuality, I look to standard hermeneutical \nrules, one of which is to not ground a weighty\u0014\ntheological belief based on one passage. If it is true that this \npassage condemns homosexuality, but I find that it is\u0014\nthe only reliable passage which does so, I cannot say that \nhomosexuality is necessarily sin. Such is the case with\u0014\npassages in 1 Co which indicate clearly that women should keep silent \nin church. This command (if taken literally)\u0014\nwas not followed in the early church, nor is it followed today. This \nis/was not because we feel the need to \"erase\"\u0014\npassages we don't agree with, but that there is obviously something \nhappening in that situation that we, today, don't\u0014\nunderstand, since women did in fact teach in the early churches \n(during which they presumably had to speak).\u0014\nMoreover, all major theological doctrines in Christianity are built \naround statements that are repeated several time in\u0014\nScripture: God loves, Jesus died and resurrected, Jesus is coming \nback, all have sinned, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy second approach to this passage is to try to understand what it \nmeans *if* it isn't a broad condemnation of\u0014\nhomosexuality. While Romans 1:18-32 is the primary text used from the \nNew Testament by those people who\u0014\ncondemn homosexuality, that has not always been the interpretation of \nthis passage. For example, verse 26, which\u0014\nis the only verse in Scripture which refers to lesbian behavior, is \noften used to round out the beliefs of those who\u0014\ncondemn all homosexuality as sin, since all of the other alleged \ncondemnations of homosexuality specifically refer to\u0014\nmale-male behavior, linguistically excluding female-female behavior. \nLooking back at early interpreters of this verse,\u0014\nwhile some have believed that this verse referred to lesbians (John \nChrysostom), many key church leaders have not\u0014\nheld this view, such as Clement of Alexandria and Saint Augustine, \nwho believed this to be anal or oral sex between\u0014\nheterosexuals (Brooten, 1985; Miller, 1995). One early Christian \nwriter, Anastasios, clearly dismisses the view that\u0014\nPaul was referring to lesbianism in his comments on Romans 1:26: \u0014\n\u0014\n     Clearly they (the females referred to in Romans 1:26) do not go \ninto one another, but rather offer\u0014\n     themselves to the men. (Brooten, 1996, p. 337n)\u0014\n\u0014\n. Augustine continues this line of thought (fairly explicitly): \u0014\n\u0014\n     But if one has relations even with one's wife in a part of the \nbody which was not made for begetting\u0014\n     children, such relations are against nature and indecent. In \nfact, the same apostle earlier said the same\u0014\n     thing about women, \"For their women exchanged natural relations \nfor those which are against nature.\"\u0014\n     (Marriage and Desire, 20.35)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that, in addition to the structural complexity of the \npassage, there is an uncertainty in the meaning of\u0014\ncertain phrases in the text, primarily \"exchanged natural relations \nfor unnatural ones\" (NIV, v. 26b). For example, this\u0014\nidea could (outside of the context of this passage) refer to sex with \na barren or pregnant woman, sex with a\u0014\nmenstruating woman, pederasty, sex between animals of different \nspecies, etc., since the person was exchanging\u0014\nthe Judaic understanding of the purpose of sex (procreation) for \nbehaviors which could not produce children\u0014\n(Brooten p. 247, 1996; Ward p. 271-273). \u0014\n\u0014\nRomans 1:18-32 is a complex passage, and any quick reading of the \nEnglish translations gives the clear impression\u0014\nthat all forms of homosexuality are being condemned. However, the \nissue of whether or not homosexuality is sin\u0014\nshould not rest on a quick reading of a translation. Digging into a \npassage, looking at patterns in and purposes of a\u0014\npassage as a whole is the only way that we can find out what any text \nis really about. This is true of Romans 1.\u0014\nEnglish translations lack a dynamic quality that is found in the \noriginal language, and obscures patterns that help us\u0014\nclarify the meaning and purpose of the text. The primary pattern in \nthis passage is the usage of the phrases \"they\u0014\nexchanged\" (met/yllaxan; v. 23, 25, 26b) and \"God gave them over\" \n(paradwken; v. 24, 26a, 28), which enclose\u0014\nthree parallel thoughts between verses 23-28. Parallelism is \nextremely common in the Hebraic and Greek literature\u0014\ninvolves repeating a thought in a different way for emphasis (see \nNils Lund Chiasmus in the New Testament,\u0014\n1942; John Welch Chiasmus in Antiquity, 1981). Paul would have been \nvery familiar with this common device of\u0014\nemphasis, and it is clear from the structure of this passage that \nPaul is using this technique to emphasize God's\u0014\nwrath against the sin of idolatry (see Douglas Moo, Romans 1-8, \n1991). He begins in verses 18-20 by showing the\u0014\nreaders that there is some part of God's character (\"His eternal \npower and divine nature\" NIV) that can be seen in\u0014\ncreation itself, apart from the special revelation found in His \nScriptures. Thus, even Greeks are without excuse as far\u0014\nas to whom they should direct their worship. Moreover, we are told \nthat these Greeks did actually know God from His\u0014\ncreation, however \"they neither glorified Him as God, nor gave thanks \nto Him\" NIV v. 21). These Greeks, and Paul\u0014\nwas specifically referring to all non-Jews (see v. 16 for Paul's \nbreakdown of people-groups for this chapter: there are\u0014\nJews, and then there is everybody else (hellyni), translated as \nGreeks in the NASB, and Gentiles in the NIV), were\u0014\nengaged in human philosophies (Stoicism, etc) and religions which \nsought to understand and worship creation apart\u0014\nfrom the Creator. Though they at one time knew God (v. 21), they \neventually ended up in the position that they \"did\u0014\nnot think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God\" (NIV, v. 28). \nPaul shows us in this chapter that this\u0014\nprogression of not glorifying God as God to abandoning the concept of \nGod leads to any number of sinful behaviors\u0014\n(murder, etc), as described in the last several verses of the chapter \n(1:29-31). Finally, we see that while somehow\u0014\nthese Gentiles knew the laws of God, and knew that breaking these \nlaws deserve death, they not only practiced\u0014\nthese behaviors, but approved of others who did the same (v. 32).\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the general outline of the chapter. The primary focus of the \nchapter is on Gentiles who stop worshipping\u0014\nGod, and who \"exchange/substitute\" (met/yllaxan) the worship of God \nfor the worship of idols. While one could easily\u0014\npostulate that the substitution here could be extended metaphorically \nto anything which takes our focus off of God\u0014\n(human philosophies, busy-ness, religiosity, etc.), Paul's language \nhere seems to limit us specifically to explicit idol\u0014\nworship. Both of the first two parallel passages (vs 23-24, 25-26a), \nwhich are clearly bounded by the repeated\u0014\nphrases \"they exchanged\" (met/yllaxan; this word refers to a \nsubstitution of one thing in place of another) and \"God\u0014\ngave them over\" (paradwken; this word refers to God allowing the \nnatural course of events to occur from the\u0014\nbehavior initiated by the Gentiles--God didn't \"cause\" them to have \nthe \"sinful desires\" (v. 24), \"shameful lusts\" (v.\u0014\n26a) or \"depraved mind\" (v. 28), but when the Gentiles abandoned God, \nparadwken implies that God stepped back\u0014\nand allowed the natural course of events to happen) very graphically \ndescribe idol worship as it would have been\u0014\nfound in Greek and Roman cultic rituals of the time of Paul's writing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Here is a full, exegetical breakdown of last \nhalf of Romans 1\u0014\n  18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the \ngodlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth\u0014\n  by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain \nto them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For\u0014\n  since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his \neternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being\u0014\n  understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. \n21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him\u0014\n  as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and \ntheir foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed\u0014\n  to be wise, they became fools \u0014\n\u0014\n  23 and exchanged (yllaxan) the glory of the immortal God for images \nmade to look like mortal man and birds and animals and\u0014\n  reptiles. 24 Therefore God gave them over (paradwken) in the sinful \ndesires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of\u0014\n  their bodies with one another. \u0014\n\u0014\n  25 They exchanged (metyllaxan) the truth of God for a lie, and \nworshipped and served created things rather than the Creator--who\u0014\n  is forever praised. Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over \n(paradwken) to shameful lusts. \u0014\n\u0014\n  Even their women exchanged (metyllaxan) natural relations for \nunnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned\u0014\n  natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one \nanother. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and\u0014\n  received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 28 \nFurthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the\u0014\n  knowledge of God, he gave them over (paradwken) to a depraved mind, \nto do what ought not to be done. \u0014\n\u0014\n  29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, \ngreed and depravity. They are full of envy,murder, strife, deceit and\u0014\n  malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, \narrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey\u0014\n  their parents; 31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, \nruthless. 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who\u0014\n  do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these \nvery things but also approve of those who practice them. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third parallel part is similarly bounded with the Greek words \nmetyllaxan and paradwken, but does not quite follow\u0014\nthe pattern of the first two parts. As in the first two parts, we see \nthat God has given them over to wicked behavior (v.\u0014\n28). However, in both of the first two parts we see that what they \nexchanged were clearly idolatrous behaviors, while\u0014\nin the third part, we see sexual behaviors being \nexchanged/substituted. This is the primary difficulty with this text. \nIf\u0014\none allows that the things being exchanged in vs. 23 and 25 are \nmetaphors for anything which draws us away from\u0014\nGod, then one can easily say that the sexual behaviors described in \nvs 26b-27 describe general homosexual\u0014\nbehavior. However, it seems like a poor handling of the texts to \nallow for such a metaphorical meaning, when the\u0014\ntexts are so explicitly concrete in their descriptions of cultic \nidolatry (\"images made to look like mortal man\" and\u0014\n\"worshipped and served created things\"). In the same way, in order to \npreserve the symmetry of the parallel verses,\u0014\none would be safest to conclude that the third parallel similarly \nrefers to cultic idolatry. The fact that homosexual\u0014\nconduct is described in this regard makes sense when one realizes \nthat homosexual temple prostitution was a\u0014\ncommon phenomenon of cultic idolatry rituals in the geographic \nlocation and time in which Paul was writing. Taking\u0014\nthis interpretation of Romans 1:26b-27 preserves the symmetry \ninherent within the text. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most likely cult that Paul was referring to was the \nCybelean/Attic mystery cult, which was one of the most\u0014\nprominent cults in Rome, and had an history going back several \nhundred years in the region. The priests and\u0014\npriestesses, called galli, whom were attempting to achieve \nneutral-gender. The goal was to transcend gender in\u0014\norder to become more like Attis (the father God, son/lover of Cybele) \nand Cybele (the mother goddess). Attis was\u0014\ncastrated and Cybele was a virgin. Both were sexually active in the \nmyth (many of Cybele's counterparts were known\u0014\nas a fertility goddess), but engaged in sexual acts that could not \nproduce children. In order to become more like their\u0014\ngods, all galli voluntarily castrated themselves, and were involved \nin ritual sexuality with the worshippers that would\u0014\ncome to the temple. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Here is a brief comparison of verses in Romans 1 \nwith galli practices\u0014\n  v. 21-22: they claimed to be wise but\u0014\n  are foolish\u0014\n                                   The galli claimed to tell people's \nfortunes, but everybody thought were\u0014\n                                   mad, the way they danced around \nand cut themselves. The Greek\u0014\n                                   texts talk about the \"mania\" of \ntheir rituals. \u0014\n  v. 23: they made images of man and\u0014\n  animals to worship\u0014\n                                   The Cybele's temple statues were \nof Attis, Cybele (and others), who\u0014\n                                   were always surrounded by other \nimages of animals, particularly lions\u0014\n                                   and snakes. In addition, the \ngalli's temples were always filled with\u0014\n                                   doves, because the galli thought \nthey were too holy to touch, to shoo\u0014\n                                   them away. The fact that all of \nthese animals were normative in the\u0014\n                                   Cybelean temples and Paul mention \nthem by name, makes it highly\u0014\n                                   likely that Paul was specifically \nreferring to this cult in Romans 1.\u0014\n  v. 26-27: exchanging natural relations,\u0014\n  etc.\u0014\n                                   One of the primary ideas of the \ngalli was to remove gender differences.\u0014\n                                   This occurred through \ntransvestitism, and physically cutting off one's\u0014\n                                   genitals. Part of this was also \nassuming the sexual characteristics of\u0014\n                                   the opposite gender, so the male \ngalli would serve sexually \"as women\"\u0014\n                                   to male worshippers in the temple. \nWomen were known to cut off their\u0014\n                                   breasts and have lesbian \nrelationships to transcend their gender.\u0014\n                                   Women had sex with men too, but in \norder to avoid pregnancy, again\u0014\n                                   like Cybele, they would have anal \nsex, not vaginal (some early church\u0014\n                                   fathers, like Clement and \nAugustine, indicate that the female behavior\u0014\n                                   referred to in these verses is not \nfemale-female behavior, but\u0014\n                                   female-male sexual behavior in a \nmanner which disallowed\u0014\n                                   pregnancy--see below for a fuller \nexplanation).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis seems to have been the view of the early church. Hippolytus, a \nChristian martyr and church leader in the early\u0014\npart of the 3rd century, ties the Cybelean rituals with the Romans \npassage. In Refutation of All Heresies, Book V, he\u0014\ndescribes both the Cybelean (\"mother of the gods\")/,Attis cults and \nthe Naassenes, a Gnostic group. \u0014\n\u0014\n     But if the mother of the gods emasculate Attis, and herself has \nthis person as an object of affection, the\u0014\n     blessed nature of the supernatural and everlasting alone recalls \nthe male power of the soul to itself. For\u0014\n     (the Naassene) says, there is the hermaphrodite man. According \nto this account of theirs, the\u0014\n     intercourse of woman with man is demonstrated, in conformity \nwith such teaching, to be exceedingly\u0014\n     wicked and filthy. For, says the Naassene, Attis has emasculated \nhimself and has passed over from the\u0014\n     earthly parts of the nether world to the everlasting substance \nabove, where thre is neither female or\u0014\n     male, but a new creature, a new man, which is hermaphrodite. [at \nwhich point Hippolytus quotes\u0014\n     Romans 1.20-23 as an introduction, then skips directly to \n1.26-27, poignantly emphasizing Paul's\u0014\n     purpose in this passage of Scripture].\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people argue against the interpretation of three parallel \naccounts of idolatry, saying that only the first two\u0014\nclauses represent parallels on idolatry. They say that it appears \nthat Paul turns his line of reasoning away from\u0014\nsimple idolatry to all sinful behavior, and that the homosexuality \ndescribed in vs. 26-27 represent an archetype of\u0014\nsin--that the Jewish and Roman readers of the book would think of \nhomosexuality and would picture some of the\u0014\nworst type of sin possible. The argument continues by stating that \nPaul finishes his thought in vs. 29-31 to list a\u0014\nlarger list of sins (which was common in Paul and other early church \nwriters--to use 'sin lists'), of which homosexuality\u0014\nis merely the first of the list, separated by v. 28, a description of \nwhat God has to do when confronted with\u0014\nunrepentant sinners. Interpreted this way, the third clause, vs. \n26b-28, does not represent simply an issue of\u0014\nidolatry, but represents all sins, and thus homosexuality cannot be \ninterpreted as limited to cultic homosexual\u0014\nprostitution. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the grammar of the passage prevents that interpretation, for \ntwo reasons, both described in Chamberlain's\u0014\nclassic textbook, An Exegetical Grammar of the Greek New \nTestament(1941/1987). First, kai kaQws, found in\u0014\nv. 28 (translated as 'since' in the NIV; see also Kasemann, \nCommentary on Romans, 1980; Fitzmeyer, Romans,\u0014\n1993) separates the previous discussion from the discussion which \nfollows it, making the homosexual behavior listed\u0014\nin vs. 26b-28 as part of a different clause than the sin list in vs. \n29-32. Chamberlain explains, saying that kaQws\u0014\nhere takes a causal meaning: \u0014\n\u0014\n     p. 176 Sometimes, it seems to shade off into the causal idea \n[quotes Rom 1:28 in Greek], 'because\u0014\n     they did not approve having God in (their) knowledge God gave \nthem up to a reprobate mind,' \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, Chamberlain discusses the verb translated as 'to do' in v. \n28: \u0014\n\u0014\n     p. 106 When it explains a verb, it is called the epexegetical \ninfinitive: poiein (Rom 1.28), 'to do' (the\u0014\n     things that are unseemly), explains what Paul means by paredwken \nautous o Qeos eis adokimon vouv,\u0014\n     'God gave them up to a reprobate mind.' The list of unseemly \nacts follows.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis gives the following paraphrased rendering of v. 28: \u0014\n\u0014\n     And because of the fact that (kai kaQws) they stopped believing \nin God, God gave them over\u0014\n     paradwken to a worthless mind, to do (poiein) evil things, as \nlisted in the following verses. \u0014\n\u0014\nThus, the acts listed in vs. 26b-27 (which are the cultic homosexual \nprostitution acts) are part of the ultimate cause\u0014\nof God giving them over, not the result of God giving them over. This \nmakes them clearly separate from the acts\u0014\nlisted in v. 29-31, which are the result of God having given them \nover, and clearly not the cause. Having\u0014\ngrammatically separated what is cause and what is result in this \npassage, it is easy to see that the homosexual acts\u0014\nmust be separate entities from the sin-list and therefore were \nintended to be interpreted in the context of the\u0014\nthree-clause, metyllaxan/paradwken system, and not as part of the \nsin-list. \u0014\n                     This gives us the following outline of the \npassage from v. 23-31:\u0014\n  Outline\u0014\n                           vs. 23a-24\u0014\n                                                        vs. 25-26a\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nvs. 26b-31\u0014\n  They exchanged\u0014\n  (met/yllaxan)\u0014\n                           God's glory (23a)\u0014\n                                                        God's truth \nfor a\u0014\n                                                        lie (25a)\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nnatural relations for\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nunnatural (26b)\u0014\n  This led them to do the\u0014\n  following\u0014\n                           make images of animals and men\u0014\n                           to worship (23b)\u0014\n                                                        worship \ncreated\u0014\n                                                        things (25b)\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nstop believing in God\u0014\n\n                                                                        \n(28a)\u0014\n  Which led God to give\u0014\n  them over to (paradwken)\u0014\n                           sinful desires/sexual\u0014\n                           impurity/degrading their bodies\u0014\n                           (24)\u0014\n                                                        shameful lusts\u0014\n                                                        (26a)\u0014\n\n                                                                        \na depraved mind, to do\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nevil things (28b-31)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only way to make this text refer to all homosexual behavior as \nopposed to merely cultic temple prostitution is to\u0014\neither rip it from its context, or to take a liberal interpretation \nof the text and make the three parallels metaphorical\u0014\ninstead of literal. This is especially clear when one looks closer at \nthe structure of the third parallel, and compares\u0014\nthat to the other two parallels. I might note that close analysis of \nthe structure is an appropriate technique to use with\u0014\nPaul. Paul was not ignorant of the rhetoric of the day, nor was Paul \ncareless with his words. Paul was a master\u0014\ncraftman when it came to language, and all of his letters show a \ngreat attention to detail and structure. At any rate,\u0014\nwithin the first two parallels, we see that God gave them over to \nevil behaviors because of certain actions they took\u0014\n(\"exchanging the glory of God for images\", and then worshipping and \nserving created things rather than the\u0014\ncreator). God does not necessarily give them over because of what \nthey have exchanged, but because of the\u0014\nactions taken because of the exchanges (in the second parallel, they \nhave exchanged the truth of God for a lie, but\u0014\nthe resulting action is that they \"worshipped and served created \nthings\"). In the third parallel, they exchange natural\u0014\nrelations (phusikyn chrysin) for those which are against nature(para \nphusin) as described in verses 26b-27.\u0014\nHowever, it was not those exchanges which led to God giving them \nover. Those exchanges resulted in verse 28,\u0014\n\"they did not think it worthwhile to retain a knowledge of God\" \n(NIV), which is what caused God to give them over. It\u0014\nwas not the sexual behavior which caused God give them over, but \ntheir abandoning their belief in God which\u0014\ncaused Him to give them over. The sexual behavior was a key part of \nthe process of them rejecting belief in God,\u0014\njust as making idols, and worshipping/serving idols was a key part of \nthe process in verses 23-26a.\u0014\n\u0014\nPara Phusin and Natural Theology\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point, it may be instructive to look at the phrase para \nphusin (\"against nature\"). In the cultural backdrop ofJudaism, the \nprimary reason for sex was procreation. Any sexual acts which did not \nwork to fulfill this goal was paraphusin. This is seen in other \nwritings of the era, such as Philo, Josephus and Plato (Ward; Brooten \n1996; DeYoung 1988). Philo, speaking as a Jewish writer contemporary \nwith Paul, specifically \"condemns men who knowingly marry barren \nwomen . . . thereby destroying their seeds. . . . These men are like \npigs or goats, and are thus antagonists ofGod and enemies of nature\" \n(Ward, p. 271). Similarly, regarding pederasty, Philo says that the \nactive partner (the dominant, \"insertive\" male) is para phusin \nbecause he \"does not procreate\" (Ward, p. 272). \u0014\n\u0014\nClement of Alexandria, speaking from an early Christian perspective, \nsimilarly makes the claim that in order for sex to be in accordance \nwith nature, procreation should be the result (Brooten p. 247, 1996). \nLinguistically, there is no specific reason why verse26 could not \nrefer to men having non-vaginal sex with women (Miller), however, the \ncontext seems somewhat prohibitive of that interpretation \n(specifically, the usage of the word \"similarly\"/\"homoiws\" in verse \n27) unless one takes into consideration the references to Clement and \nAugustine above. Regardless, the usage of para phusin is another \ndifficult part of this passage, not only because it does not clarify \nthe nature of the relationships that \"their (the male Gentiles') \nwomen\" exchanged, but it also classes Paul's entire argument into a \nvery debated area, namely that of \"natural theology.\" As discussed \nelsewhere in this paper, Paul's usage of natural theology is not very \nhelpful to us as we attempt to apply New Testament rules to Western \nsociety. In ancient Greece and Judaism, since women were little more \nthan property, there were strict sex-roles that had to be maintained. \u0014\n\u0014\nAny show of dominance of a woman, or passivity of a man was an \n\"exchange\" that was \"against nature.\" Take, for example, Paul's clear \ncommand in 1 Timothy 2:11-14 that women must be silent and in \nsubmission to their men, which Paul relates back to the creation \naccount with Adam and Eve (the created \"natural order\"). Then in 1 \nCorinthians 11:3-17 Paul makes a similar case, this time claiming \nthat \"the very nature (phusis) of things\" (NIV, v. 14) should make it \nevident to us that men must have short hair, and that women must have \nlong hair. However, this is neither evident to those in most cultures \ntoday, nor is it currently practiced among Christians. The reason for \nthis dismissal of Paul's commands isn't a rejection of the Gospel, \nbut an acceptance that the cultural dogmas of Paul's time which \nsubordinated women as property are no longer in effect today, and it \nwould be inappropriate for us to tie the Gospel to such ideologies. \nSo Paul's argument \"from nature,\" rather than universalizing his case \nto all places and all times, seems to do the opposite, and limits the \nconsequences of issues tied to natural theology to Paul's own time \nand culture. Similarly with the homosexual descriptions in Romans \n1:26-27, even if the behaviors mentioned there didn't already seem to \nbe limited to cultic temple prostitution by the context of the triple \nparallelism, Paul's linking the behavior to natural theology seems to \nfurther limit it, and calls into question its relevance for today's \nculture. \u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, not only does Paul tie the sexual behavior described here \nto his natural theology, but he also ties it to the word \nexekauthysan, which describes the men as \"inflamed with lust\" (NIV). \nThis word, which literally means \"utterly consumed by fire\" \n(Hultgren), describes a behavior which has nothing to do with a \nnormal, monogamous relationship. This kind of lust is one that grows \nto control all of one's thoughts and is insatiable. This is not the \nkind of simple longings and drives described earlier in the passage \n(\"sinful desires\"/\"epithumiais\", \"sexual impurity\"/\"akatharsian\", v. \n24; \"shameful lusts\"/\"pathy atimias\", v. 26, NIV), but describe an \nall consuming force which takes control and destroys. While this type \nof phenomenon can admittedly be found in some homos\u0014",

    "words": "HOW \nTO RAISE A HERO\u0014\n\u0014\n                     By Kim Clark       U., S. News and World Report, \nAugust 27, 2001 \u0014\n\u0014\n                     In a playroom in a Cambridge, Mass., elementary \nschool, a young woman sits and\u0014\n                     plays with two kindergartners. The woman, a \nresearch assistant for psychologist\u0014\n                     Ervin Staub, gets up, tells the kids she's \nleaving them alone for a while, and closes the\u0014\n                     door behind her. The kids hear a crash, and then \na child's cry, from the playroom\u0014\n                     they've been told is next door. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     What happens next fuels both hope and despair in \nanyone concerned about how to\u0014\n                     raise kids who are at least helpfulif not \nheroic. About half of the time at least one of\u0014\n                     the 5-year-olds runs next door to help. And as \nkids mature, they become even more\u0014\n                     helpful. Fully 90 percent of second graders run \nnext door. But then it gets distressing.\u0014\n                     Only 40 percent of fourth graders run to help. \nAnd just 30 percent of sixth graders try\u0014\n                     to help. The older kids explain they were afraid \nthe adult would be angry if they left the\u0014\n                     room. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Staub, one of the nation's pre-eminent \nresearchers into altruism, believes his\u0014\n                     experiment shows that empathy, altruism, and \ncaring, some of the basic building blocks\u0014\n                     of heroism, naturally develop in most children. \nBut then, Staub says, society and\u0014\n                     parents often quash it by enforcing simplistic \nrules about obedience and failing to\u0014\n                     encourage kids to keep helping. There is cause \nfor hope, however. Staub's\u0014\n                     experiments and research into real-life heroes \nreveal seven techniques to strengthen\u0014\n                     the inner hero in just about any youngster: \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Start with small, safe steps. Staub says many \nparents discourage heroic behavior\u0014\n                     in kids because of justifiable safety concerns. \nBut there are plenty of safe ways to\u0014\n                     practice heroism, he says. In research on \nschoolyard bullying, he has found that even\u0014\n                     small nonviolent gestures can help stop \nchildhood victimization. Parents and teachers\u0014\n                     can, for example, encourage kids to be a \n\"positive bystander.\" A child who sees\u0014\n                     another kid being picked on can turn to another \nbystander and try to create an ally by\u0014\n                     saying, \"He shouldn't do that,\" Staub says. Or \nsimply being warm and affectionate\u0014\n                     toward the victim can help turn others against \nthe bully. Some of Staub's other\u0014\n                     experiments show that kids who try such \nsmall-scale heroism go on to bigger heroic\u0014\n                     actions. \"They learn by doing,\" he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Label them \"good.\" Experiments by Joan Grusec, a \npsychologist at the University of\u0014\n                     Toronto, found that children helped more after \nthey were given complimentary labels,\u0014\n                     rather than simple praise. Instead of just \nsaying, \"That's a good thing to do\" when a\u0014\n                     child shares toys, she suggests adding something \nlike: \"You're the kind of person who\u0014\n                     likes to help people.\" Her research indicates \nsuch positive labels help a child develop a\u0014\n                     self-image as a helperand thus lead to more \nvoluntary helping. Labeling cuts both\u0014\n                     ways, however, Grusec warns. If the parents give \na negative label when the child\u0014\n                     misbehaves, saying something like \"You're \nselfish,\" then the child will likely live down\u0014\n                     to that identity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Train. In a study of people who intervened to \nstop a crime in the mid-1970s, Gilbert\u0014\n                     Geis, then a sociologist at the University of \nCalifornia-Irvine, found that real-life heroes,\u0014\n                     on average, had more physical strength and some \nkind of specialized training.\u0014\n                     Bystanders oftentimes don't take action because \nthey correctly believe they don't have\u0014\n                     the skills needed to help. Heroes rushed in \nbecause they had trained in martial arts,\u0014\n                     CPR, swimming, or other related activities. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Make them responsible. Staub believes that \ngiving kids responsibility for animals or\u0014\n                     other children makes them more caring adults. \nEven small increases in responsibility\u0014\n                     greatly increase heroic action. In one \nexperiment, Staub had the departing graduate\u0014\n                     student identify one child in the group and say, \n\"I will leave you in charge, ok?\" before\u0014\n                     leaving. That simple statement greatly increased \nthe likelihood that a child would go to\u0014\n                     the rescue after hearing a crash next door. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Set an example, and explain it. Setting a good \nexample is important, says Arizona\u0014\n                     State University altruism researcher Nancy \nEisenberg. But her experiments showed\u0014\n                     that kids were much more likely to copy \naltruistic behavior if the adult also explained his\u0014\n                     or her actions. A father, thus, might help a \nneighbor's kid and then explain to his own\u0014\n                     child that he's doing it because \"people are \nhappy when you help them,\" she says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Don't pay. Eisenberg also found that kids who \nwere rewarded for good behavior with\u0014\n                     stickers or other goodies were less likely to \nhelp later on. Researchers theorize that\u0014\n                     such a reward makes kids think they should be \npaid for being altruistic and thus lose\u0014\n                     interest in helping for any other reason. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Don't swat. Resist the temptation to use a tap \non the behind or the all-purpose reason\u0014\n                     \"Because I said so.\" Marvin Berkowitz, a child \npsychologist and altruism researcher at\u0014\n                     the University of Missouri-St. Louis, says \nstudies indicate kids' altruism may be\u0014\n                     strengthened when parents keep physical \npunishment to a minimum, explain discipline,\u0014\n                     and point out the consequences of kids' actions. \nWhen a child is, say, throwing sand\u0014\n                     at another, \"You can yell, 'Cut that out! I'm \nreally angry with you!' \" Berkowitz says. But\u0014\n                     then parents should explain why: \"You've made \nthe other boy cry. How do you think\u0014\n                     sand in his eyesmakes him feel? Sad!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     If this all seems too complicated, Samuel \nOliner, one of the foremost researchers on\u0014\n                     heroism, says you can boil it all down to one \nsimple word: love. Children raised with\u0014\n                     love are more likely to help their fellow human \nbeings in time of need, he says. Simple,\u0014\n                     yes. But not easy.\u0014",

    "words": "Finding the Truth \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How the earliest church decided Marcion and the \nGnostics, among others,\u0014\n                      were wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Justo Gonzlez, Jr \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Long before the controversies of the fourth and \nfifth centuries, the church had already\u0014\n                      been dealing with heresy for some time. Early \non teachers arose who said they had\u0014\n                      special access to Jesus' \"real teachings.\" So \nearly on, the church had to come up with\u0014\n                      methods for discerning truth and rejecting \nerror.\u0014\n                      In his The Story of Christianity (Harper & Row, \n1984), Justo Gonzlez, a member of the\u0014\n                      faculty of the Interdenominational Theological \nCenter in Atlanta, discusses the two most\u0014\n                      powerful heresies of the earliest church and \nhow it responded. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Secret knowledge \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of all the differing interpretations of \nChristianity, none was as dangerous, nor as close to\u0014\n                      victory, as was Gnosticism. This was a vast and \namorphous movement that existed both\u0014\n                      within and outside the church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The name Gnosticism derives from the Greek word \ngnoses, which means \"knowledge.\"\u0014\n                      According to the Gnostics, they possessed a \nspecial, mystical knowledge reserved for\u0014\n                      those with true understanding. That knowledge \nwas the secret key to salvation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Salvation was the main concern of the Gnostics. \nThey concluded that all matter is evil, or\u0014\n                      at best unreal. A human being is in reality an \neternal spirit that somehow has been\u0014\n                      imprisoned in a body. Since the body is a \nprison to the spirit, and since it misguides us\u0014\n                      as to our true nature, it is evil. Therefore \nthe Gnostics' final goal was to escape from the\u0014\n                      body and this material world in which we are \nexiled. The world is not our true home but\u0014\n                      rather an obstacle to the salvation of the \nspirit. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How, then, is the origin of the world and of \nthe body to be explained? Gnosticism affirmed\u0014\n                      that originally all reality was spiritual. The \nsupreme being had no intention of creating a\u0014\n                      material world but only a spiritual one. Thus a \nnumber of spiritual beings were\u0014\n                      generated. Gnostic teachers did not agree as to \ntheir exact number, with some systems\u0014\n                      positing 365 such spiritual beings or \"eons.\" \nIn any case, one of these eons, far removed\u0014\n                      from the supreme being, fell into error and \nthus created the material world. According to\u0014\n                      one system, for instance, Wisdom, one of the \neons, wished to produce something by\u0014\n                      herself, and the resulting \"abortion\" was the \nworld. That is what the world is in\u0014\n                      Gnosticism: an abortion of the spirit and not a \ndivine creation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But since this world was made by a spiritual \nbeing, there are still \"sparks\" or \"bits\" of\u0014\n                      spirit in it. It is these that have been \nimprisoned in human bodies and must be liberated\u0014\n                      through gnosis. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In order to achieve that liberation, a \nspiritual messenger must come to this world to\u0014\n                      waken us from our \"dream.\" Our spirits are \n\"asleep\" within our bodies, being driven by\u0014\n                      the impulses and passions of the body, and \nsomeone must come from beyond to remind\u0014\n                      us who we really are and to call us to struggle \nagainst our incarceration. This messenger\u0014\n                      brings the gnosis, the secret knowledge and \ninspiration necessary for salvation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Above us are the heavenly spheres, each ruled \nby an evil power whose aim is to impede\u0014\n                      our progress to the spiritual realm. In order \nto reach the spiritual \"fullness,\" we must\u0014\n                      break through each of those spheres. The only \nway to do this is to have the secret\u0014\n                      knowledge that opens the way-much like a \nspiritual password. The heavenly messenger\u0014\n                      has been sent precisely to give us that \nknowledge, without which there is no salvation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Christian Gnosticism, that messenger is \nChrist. Christ has come to earth to remind us\u0014\n                      of our heavenly origin and to give us the \nsecret knowledge without which we cannot\u0014\n                      return to the spiritual mansions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Since Christ is a heavenly messenger, and since \nbody and matter are evil, most\u0014\n                      Christian Gnostics rejected the notion that \nChrist had a body like ours. Some said his\u0014\n                      body was an appearance, a sort of ghost that \nmiraculously seemed to be a real body.\u0014\n                      Many distinguished between the heavenly \n\"Christ\" and the earthly \"Jesus.\" In some\u0014\n                      cases, this was coupled with the notion that \nJesus did have a body but that this was of a\u0014\n                      \"spiritual matter,\" different from ours. Most \ndenied the birth of Jesus, which would have\u0014\n                      put him under the power of the material world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      All these notions are various degrees of what \nthe rest of the church called docetism-a\u0014\n                      name derived from a Greek word meaning \"to \nseem,\" for all these doctrines implied, in\u0014\n                      one way or another, that the body of Jesus \nappeared to be fully human but was not. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meanwhile, how is this life to be lived? At \nthis point, Gnostics gave two divergent\u0014\n                      answers. Most declared that, since the body is \nthe prison of the spirit, one must control\u0014\n                      the body and its passions and thus weaken its \npower over the spirit. But there were also\u0014\n                      some who held that, since the spirit is by \nnature good and cannot be destroyed, we are\u0014\n                      to leave the body to its own devices and let it \nfollow the guidance of its own passions.\u0014\n                      Thus while some Gnostics were extreme ascetics, \nothers were libertines. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Gnosticism was a serious threat to Christianity \nthroughout the second century. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Anti-Jehovah \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marcion, whose father was bishop of Sinope in \nPontus, knew Christianity from an early\u0014\n                      age. But he had a profound dislike towards both \nJudaism and the material world. About\u0014\n                      a.d. 144, he went to Rome, where he gathered a \nfollowing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Since Marcion was convinced that the world is \nevil, he concluded that its creator must be\u0014\n                      either evil or ignorant. But instead of \npositing a long series of spiritual beings, as the\u0014\n                      Gnostics did, Marcion proposed a much simpler \nsolution. According to him, the God and\u0014\n                      Father of Jesus is not the same as Jehovah, the \nGod of the Old Testament. It was\u0014\n                      Jehovah who made this world. The Father's \npurpose was that there be only a spiritual\u0014\n                      world. But Jehovah, either through ignorance or \nout of an evil intent, made this world and\u0014\n                      placed humankind in it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This means that the Hebrew Scriptures are \nindeed inspired by a god, although this is\u0014\n                      Jehovah and not the Supreme Father. Jehovah is \nan arbitrary god, who chooses a\u0014\n                      particular people above all the rest. And he is \nalso vindictive, constantly keeping an\u0014\n                      account on those who disobey him and punishing \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Over against Jehovah, and far above him, is the \nFather of Christians. This God is not\u0014\n                      vindictive but loving. This God requires \nnothing of us but rather gives everything freely,\u0014\n                      including salvation. This God does not seek to \nbe obeyed but to be loved. It is out of\u0014\n                      compassion for us, Jehovah's creatures, that \nthe Supreme God has sent his Son to save\u0014\n                      us, who simply appeared as a grown man during \nthe reign of Tiberius. Naturally at the\u0014\n                      end, there will be no judgment, since the \nSupreme God is absolutely loving and will\u0014\n                      simply forgive us. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      All this led Marcion to set the Hebrew \nScriptures aside. If the Old Testament was the\u0014\n                      word of an inferior god, it should not be read \nin the churches nor used as the basis of\u0014\n                      Christian instruction. In order to fill this \ngap, Marcion compiled a list of books that he\u0014\n                      considered true Christian Scriptures. These \nwere the epistles of Paul-one of the few,\u0014\n                      according to Marcion, who had really understood \nJesus' message-and the Gospel of\u0014\n                      Luke. As to the many quotations from the Old \nTestament in Luke and Paul, Marcion\u0014\n                      explained them away as interpolations-the \nhandiwork of Judaizers seeking to subvert the\u0014\n                      original message. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For a number of years, this rival church \nachieved a measure of success, and even after\u0014\n                      it was clearly defeated, it lingered on for \ncenturies. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Back to the Bible \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marcion's list was the first attempt to put \ntogether a \"New Testament.\" When early\u0014\n                      Christians spoke of \"Scripture,\" what they \nmeant was the Hebrew Scriptures, usually in\u0014\n                      the Greek version known as the Septuagint. It \nwas also customary to read in church\u0014\n                      passages from one or several Gospels, as well \nas from the Epistles-particularly Paul's.\u0014\n                      Since there was no approved list, different \nGospels were read in different churches, and\u0014\n                      the same was true of other books. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Marcion's challenge required a response, \nand thus the church at large began to\u0014\n                      compile a list of sacred Christian writings. \nThis was not done in a formal manner, through\u0014\n                      a council or special meeting. A consensus \ndeveloped gradually. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There was no question, except among Gnostics \nand Marcionites, that the Hebrew\u0014\n                      Scripture was part of the Christian canon. This \nwas important as a proof that God had\u0014\n                      been preparing the way for the advent of \nChristianity and even as a way of\u0014\n                      understanding the nature of the God who had \nbeen revealed in Jesus Christ. Christian\u0014\n                      faith was the fulfillment of the hope of Israel \nand not a sudden apparition from heaven.\u0014\n                      As to what is now called the New Testament, the \nGospels were the first to attain general\u0014\n                      recognition. It is important to note that those \nearly Christians decided to include more\u0014\n                      than one Gospel in their canon. They did this \nas a direct response to the challenge of\u0014\n                      Marcion and Gnosticism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many Gnostic teachers claimed that the heavenly \nmessenger had trusted his secret\u0014\n                      knowledge to a particular disciple, who alone \nwas the true interpreter of the message.\u0014\n                      Thus various Gnostic groups had a book that \nclaimed to present the true teachings of\u0014\n                      Jesus. Such was, for instance, the Gospel of \nSaint Thomas. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In response, the church at large sought to show \nthat its doctrines were not based on the\u0014\n                      supposed witness of a single apostle or Gospel \nbut on the consensus of the entire\u0014\n                      apostolic tradition. The very fact that the \nvarious Gospels differed in matters of detail but\u0014\n                      agreed on the basic issues at stake made their \nagreement a more convincing argument. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the end of the second century, the core of \nthe canon was established: the four\u0014\n                      Gospels, Acts, and the Pauline epistles. On the \nshorter books of the present canon,\u0014\n                      there was no consensus until a much later date. \nIt was in the second half of the fourth\u0014\n                      century that a complete consensus was achieved \nas to exactly which books ought to be\u0014\n                      included in the New Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The symbol of faith \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another element in the church's response to \nheresies was what we now call the Apostles'\u0014\n                      Creed. Its basic text was put together, \nprobably in Rome, around the year 150. It was\u0014\n                      then called \"symbol of the faith.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The word symbol meant a means of recognition, \nsuch as a token that a general gave to\u0014\n                      a messenger so that the recipient could \nrecognize a true messenger. Likewise, the\u0014\n                      \"symbol\" put together in Rome was a means \nwhereby Christians could distinguish true\u0014\n                      believers from those who followed the various \nheresies, particularly Gnosticism and\u0014\n                      Marcionism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the main uses of this symbol was in \nbaptism, where it was presented to the\u0014\n                      candidate in the form of a series of three \nquestions: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Do you believe in God the Father almighty? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Do you believe in Christ Jesus, the Son of God, \nwho was born of the Holy Ghost and of\u0014\n                      Mary the virgin, who was crucified under \nPontius Pilate, and died, and rose again at the\u0014\n                      third day, living from among the dead, and \nascended unto heaven and sat at the right of\u0014\n                      the Father, and will come to judge the quick \nand the dead? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy \nchurch, and the resurrection of the flesh? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Closer scrutiny clearly shows that this early \ncreed is directed against Marcion and the\u0014\n                      Gnostics. First, the Greek word pantokrator, \nusually translated as \"almighty,\" literally\u0014\n                      means \"all ruling.\" What is meant here is that \nthere is nothing, and certainly not the\u0014\n                      material world, that falls outside of God's \nrule. The distinction between a spiritual reality\u0014\n                      that serves God and a material reality that \ndoes not is rejected. This world, its matter and\u0014\n                      its physical bodies, are part of the \"all\" over \nwhich God reigns. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The creed's most extensive paragraph is the one \ndealing with the Son. This is because it\u0014\n                      was precisely in their Christology that Marcion \nand the Gnostics differed most widely from\u0014\n                      the church. First, we are told that Jesus \nChrist is the \"Son of God.\" Other ancient\u0014\n                      versions say \"Son of the same\" or \"His Son.\" \nJesus is the Son of the God who rules over\u0014\n                      this world and over all reality. The birth \"of \nMary the virgin\" is not there primarily in order\u0014\n                      to stress the virgin birth-although, quite \nclearly, that is affirmed-but rather to affirm the\u0014\n                      very fact that Jesus was born and did not \nsimply appear on earth, as Marcion and others\u0014\n                      claimed. The reference to Pontius Pilate is not \nthere to put the blame on the Roman\u0014\n                      governor but rather to date the event to insist \non the fact that it was a historical, datable\u0014\n                      event. And docetism is further denied by \ndeclaring that Jesus \"was crucified died, and\u0014\n                      rose again.\" Finally, it is affirmed that this \nsame Jesus will return \"to judge,\" a notion that\u0014\n                      Marcion would never accept. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The \"holy church\" is affirmed because \nChristians were beginning to underscore the\u0014\n                      authority of the church. And the \"resurrection \nof the flesh\" is a final rejection of any\u0014\n                      notion that the flesh is evil or of no \nconsequence. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      No more secrets \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the struggle against heresy, the debate \nfinally came to the issue of the authority of the\u0014\n                      church. All agreed that the true message was \nthe one taught by Jesus. The Gnostics\u0014\n                      claimed that they had some secret access to \nthat original message through a succession\u0014\n                      of secret teachers. Marcion claimed that he had \naccess to that message through the\u0014\n                      writings of Paul and Luke-which, however, had \nto be purged of what did not agree with\u0014\n                      Marcion's views regarding the Old Testament. \nThe church at large claimed to be in\u0014\n                      possession of the original gospel and the true \nteachings of Jesus. Thus what was\u0014\n                      debated was in a way the authority of the \nchurch against the claims of the heretics. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At this point, the notion of apostolic \nsuccession became very important. What was\u0014\n                      argued was simply that, had Jesus had some \nsecret knowledge to communicate to his\u0014\n                      disciples-which in fact he did not-he would \nhave entrusted that teaching to the same\u0014\n                      apostles to whom he entrusted the church. If \nthose apostles had received any such\u0014\n                      teaching, they in turn would have passed it on \nto those who were to follow them in the\u0014\n                      leadership of the church. Therefore, were there \nany such secret teaching, it should be\u0014\n                      found among the direct disciples of the \napostles, and the successors of those disciples,\u0014\n                      the bishops. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the truth of the matter is that those who \ncan now-that is, in the second century-claim\u0014\n                      direct apostolic succession unanimously deny \nthe existence of any such secret teaching.\u0014\n                      In conclusion, the Gnostic claim that there is \na secret tradition, and that they have been\u0014\n                      entrusted with it, is false. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In order to strengthen this argument, it was \nnecessary to show that the bishops of the\u0014\n                      time were indeed successors of the apostles. \nThis was not difficult, since several of the\u0014\n                      most ancient churches had lists of bishops \nlinking them with the apostolic past. Rome,\u0014\n                      Antioch, Ephesus, and others had such lists. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Be it through actual bishops or through other \nleaders (some early churches were\u0014\n                      headed by councils of \"elders\"), the orthodox \nchurch of the second century could show\u0014\n                      its connection with the apostles in a way in \nwhich Marcion and the Gnostics could not. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The \"catholic\" church \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The word catholic means \"universal,\" but it \nalso means \"according to the whole.\" To\u0014\n                      separate itself from the various heretical \ngroups and sects, the ancient church began\u0014\n                      calling itself \"catholic.\" This title \nunderscored both its universality and the inclusiveness\u0014\n                      of the witness on which it stood. It was the \nchurch \"according to the whole,\" that is,\u0014\n                      according to the total witness of all the \napostles. Only the church \"catholic,\" the church\u0014\n                      \"according to the whole,\" could lay claim to \nthe entire apostolic witness. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ironically, through an evolution that took \ncenturies, debates regarding the true meaning\u0014\n                      of catholic came to be centered on the person \nand authority of a single apostle-Peter. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A condensed excerpt from The Story of \nChristianity by Justo L.

    "title": "HARM OF SPANKING OVERSTATED?",
    "words": "THE NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE  8/30/01\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to raising children, no debate is more contentious or \nlonger running than the dispute over spanking.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question of whether a swat on the behind is an acceptable method \nof discipline has bedeviled parents, divided pediatricians and \nspawned impassioned anti-spanking and pro-spanking camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nA talk given yesterday at the annual meeting of the American \nPsychological Association in San Francisco could amplify the uproar \nby several decibels. Diane Baumrind, a child development expert at \nthe University of California at Berkeley, asserted that social \nscientists have overstepped the evidence in claiming that spanking \ncauses lasting harm to the child, such as depression, juvenile \ndelinquency and lowered mental ability.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The scientific case against the use of normative physical punishment \nis a leaky dike, not a solid edifice,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaumrind, a psychologist known for her widely respected studies of \nstyles of child rearing, said she did not advocate spanking. But she \nargues that an occassional swat; when delivered in the context of \ngood child rearing, has not been shown to do any harm.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe studies cited by opponents of corporal punishment, Baumrind \ncontended, often do not adequately distinguish the effects of \nspanking, as practiced by non-abusive parents, from the impact of \nsevere physical punishment and abuse. Nor do they consider other \nfactors that might account for problems later in life, such as \nwhether parents are rejecting or whether defiant or aggressive \nchildren might be more likely to be spanked the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaumrind described findings from her own research, an analysis of \ndata from a1ong-term study of more than 100 families indicating that \nmild to moderate had no detrimental effects when such confounding \ninfluences were out.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When parents are loving and firm and communicate well with the \nchild,\" Baumrind said yesterday, \"the children are exceptionally \ncompetent and well-adjusted, whether or not their parents spanked \nthem as pre-schoolers.  \u0014\n\u0014\nBaumrind argued that without compelling evidence that spanking was \nharmful, parents should be free to raise their children in accordance \nwith their own values and traditions.\u0014\n \u0014\nMurray Straus of the University of New Hampshire, who opposes \nspanking, praised Baumrind's study. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It may be the best single study available,\" he said, in terms of \nmethodology.\u0014\nBut the findings did not change his view that spanking is harmful.. \nAnd there's strong evidence that other methods work just as well,\" \nsaid Straus, the author of \"Beating the Devil Out of Them: Corporal \nPimishment by American Families and Its Effects on Children.\"\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO BEAT BIN LADEN",
    "words": "Thursday, Sep. 13, 2001\u0014\nHow to Beat Bin Laden\u0014\nHow Osama Bin Laden operates  and what it will take to defeat him\u0014\nBY TONY KARON\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington may never have declared war on Osama Bin Laden, but he has\u0014\nbeen at war with America for the better part of a decade. Now, with \nthe Saudi\u0014\nterrorist-financier a prime suspect in the World Trade Center attack, \nPresident\u0014\nBush has vowed that the U.S. will devote all necessary resources to \nbeating Bin\u0014\nLaden. This is no easy task. If Bin Laden is in fact responsible, the \nmost\u0014\nimportant thing is to know right now is: who is he? How does he \noperate? And\u0014\nwhy does he seem to have so much support? \u0014\n\u0014\nUnderstanding the enemy This will be a protracted, complex and\u0014\nunconventional war in which many of the tactics of war as we know it \nare\u0014\nsuperfluous. The \"Powell Doctrine\"  the theory that wars are best \nwon by\u0014\ndeploying \"overwhelming force\"  doesn't apply here, for the simple \nreason\u0014\nthat the enemy has hardly any visible military assets or civilian \neconomic\u0014\ninfrastructure, and may not even be ultimately dependent on his \ncurrent\u0014\nterritorial home base. And applying such force in territories where \nhe has\u0014\nsought support or shelter could open up a protracted, costly and \ndifficult\u0014\nconflict. The battle with Bin Laden is more likely to combine \nconventional\u0014\nmilitary tactics with unconventional ones. Because Bin Laden is no \nordinary foe.\u0014\n\u0014\nOsama Bin Laden is a man, not a state. And he\u0014\nwields very little by way of conventional military\u0014\npower. Estimates of the number of men under\u0014\narms in his Afghanistan camps at any one point\u0014\nseldom range above 2,000. But those men are\u0014\nextremely well-trained, well-funded and have\u0014\nshown a fanatical willingness to die in order to\u0014\ninflict pain on their enemies. Technology and\u0014\nglobalization have made their reach almost\u0014\nboundless, and they are linked to a vast network\u0014\nof terrorist groups throughout the Muslim world\u0014\nfrom western China and the Philippines all the\u0014\nway across to Algeria. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden's is hardly the first terrorist group to\u0014\noperate well beyond home base, but it is the first\u0014\ntruly global terror operation. And where Cold\u0014\nWar-era terrorist groups invariably relied on the\u0014\nsupport of \"rogue\" states, Bin Laden's is\u0014\nindependent. It is able to finance itself and\u0014\nprovide sophisticated training to its own men \u0014\nand build its operational alliances by providing\u0014\nsuch training to like-minded groups. And it has\u0014\nalready demonstrated an ability to relocate its\u0014\nheadquarters from one country to another. \u0014\n\u0014\nTargeting America \u0014\n\u0014\nThe foundations of Bin Laden's network were laid\u0014\nduring the Afghan war, during which the wealthy\u0014\nSaudi heir had been the prime organizer of\u0014\nvolunteers for the 'jihad' against the Soviet\u0014\ninvasion. That made him a key player in an effort\u0014\nbacked by the CIA and the intelligence agencies\u0014\nof Egypt and Saudi Arabia to funnel aid,\u0014\nequipment, training and volunteers to the Afghan\u0014\nmujahedeen. Many of the \"Arab Afghans,\" as the\u0014\nvolunteers became known, had been radical\u0014\nIslamist dissidents in their home countries, and\u0014\ntheir pro-Western governments were only too\u0014\nhappy to ship them off to fight the Russians. But\u0014\nthe 'jihad' experience forged unprecedented\u0014\nbonds among the world's radical Islamists, turning\u0014\nthem in spirit and in direct combat experience into\u0014\na single army of 'holy' warriors. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden emerged from the Afghan experience determined to overthrow \nSaudi\u0014\nArabia's pro-Western rulers and institute a radical brand of Islamic \nrule. And\u0014\nwhen those rulers invited U.S. troops onto Saudi soil to defend them \nagainst\u0014\nSaddam Hussein, Bin Laden began to call for a global 'jihad' against \nthe U.S.\u0014\nbecause of its support for Israel and for moderate Arab regimes. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe set up camps in Afghanistan and the Sudan  two states that the \nend of\u0014\nthe Cold War left in conditions of near collapse  to keep his \"Arab \nAfghans\"\u0014\ntogether. And he combined his own personal fortune with funds raised\u0014\nthroughout the Arab world to maintain his \"Al Qaida\" (\"The Base\") \norganization,\u0014\nwhich began sending fighters to Bosnia, Chechnya and to Muslim \ninsurgencies\u0014\nall over East Asia. Bin Laden also extended his reach by turning his \ncamps into\u0014\na terrorism college providing highly specialized training to Islamist \nfighters from\u0014\nall over the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden began attacking the U.S. in 1993, claiming responsibility in\u0014\nretrospect for the ambush that killed some 17 U.S. soldiers in \nMogadishu that\u0014\nyear. Although he had no direct role in the first World Trade Center \nbombing,\u0014\nhe later sheltered its perpetrator, Ramzi Yousef, after the attack. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. hits back \u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. military finally put Bin Laden in its sights following the \n1998 East\u0014\nAfrican embassy bombings. President Clinton ordered cruise missile \nstrikes on\u0014\ncamps associated with Bin Laden in Afghanistan and on a factory \nlinked with\u0014\nhim (possibly erroneously) in the Sudan. But those strikes did little \nto impair Bin\u0014\nLaden's operational ability, and the U.S. reverted to containing his \noperations\u0014\nthrough cooperation with Arab intelligence agencies to foil planned \nattacks and\u0014\nround up and prosecute the perpetrators of the embassy bombings.\u0014\nWashington also sought to use Pakistan's close relationship with the \nTaliban to\u0014\npress Bin Laden's hosts into extraditing him, but to no avail. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bush administration has promised a full-blown war against Bin \nLaden\u0014\nfollowing Tuesday's attacks, but the key to winning that war and \neliminating the\u0014\nterrorist threat may lie in the extent to which the terrorists can be \nisolated. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsolating Bin Laden \u0014\n\u0014\nWithout the layers of support he has mustered in the Islamic world, \nBin Laden\u0014\nwould be nothing more than a crazy killer who could be hunted down and\u0014\nbrought to trial or simply eliminated. Instead, his relatively tiny \norganization has\u0014\nmenaced the world's largest military power largely because of its \nability to\u0014\ncapitalize on growing anti-American sentiment in the Arab world. \u0014\n\u0014\nReports of funds interdicted en route to Bin Laden in recent years \nsuggest that\u0014\nhe continues to enjoy the support of some wealthy Arab businessmen, \nwho\u0014\neither directly support his beliefs or else are inclined to hedge \ntheir bets on the\u0014\noutcome of his battle with the U.S. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-American anger on the Arab streets  fueled by the ongoing \ncampaign\u0014\nagainst Iraq and by Israeli military actions against the Palestinian \nuprising \u0014\nprovides Bin Laden with a growing pool of potential recruits, often \nhighly\u0014\neducated and skilled young men who are willing to die for his cause. \nAnd the\u0014\npassions on the street also make it more difficult for even pro-U.S.\u0014\ngovernments in the Arab world to be seen to be working too closely \nwith\u0014\nWashington. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsolating Bin Laden may require ongoing efforts to repair and maintain\u0014\nWashington's relations with its Arab allies, whose security services \nremain the\u0014\nfront line of the battle against Bin Laden. \u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding a coalition \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile NATO's support improves the U.S. striking power and widens \npolitical and\u0014\ndiplomatic consent for any counterstrike, the crucial allies in the \nbattle against\u0014\nBin Laden remain the governments and security services of the Islamic \nworld \u0014\nbecause it is intelligence, rather than air power or armor, that wins \nthe war on\u0014\nterrorism. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the ability of U.S. satellites to intercept cell-phone and \nemail messages,\u0014\nhuman intelligence remains the most effective way of staying \nforewarned of Bin\u0014\nLaden's plans and movements. That's not going to be easy. There are \ndistinct\u0014\nlimits on the ability of U.S. agents to directly infiltrate Bin \nLaden's networks,\u0014\nwhich are often based on family and other kinship ties. Such \noperations would\u0014\nrequire agents able to blend in ethnically and spend years away from \ntheir\u0014\nAmerican lives in the extremely harsh conditions of Bin Laden's \nmountain\u0014\ncamps. Plainly, the U.S. needs the active support of allied security \nservices\u0014\ncloser to the action. And the need to maintain such alliances also \naffects the\u0014\nrange of options for responding to the latest outrage. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy not simply bomb Kabul? \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the U.S. will very likely seek to punish the Taliban for \nhosting Bin\u0014\nLaden in Afghanistan, Afghanistan long ago ceased to function as a \nstate. The\u0014\nTaliban are simply its dominant militia, and to the people of Kabul, \nthey are\u0014\noutside occupiers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile determined to hit hard against both the perpetrators and their \nprotectors,\u0014\nU.S. officials will also be mindful of the danger of taking actions  \nparticularly\u0014\nany that cause suffering among innocents  that widens the \nanti-American\u0014\nsentiment in the Muslim world on which Bin Laden feeds. \u0014\n\u0014\nInvasion? \u0014\n\u0014\nOthers have asked why the U.S. doesn't simply round up a Gulf \nWar-style\u0014\nposse to invade Afghanistan, overthrowing the Taliban and putting an \nend to\u0014\nthe country being used as a safe haven for terrorists. But that would \nrequire\u0014\ntens of thousands of allied troops deployed in an open-ended \ncommitment to\u0014\nkeep a heavy troop presence in an extremely unfriendly environment. \nIf the\u0014\ndecision is made to take down the Taliban, that may be more likely to \nbe\u0014\nattempted in concert with its regional enemies  including Russia and \npossibly\u0014\neven Iran  in support of the Northern Alliance opposition forces. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pakistan dilemma \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trickiest aspect of the Bin Laden equation may be Pakistan. \nDespite being\u0014\na close ally of the U.S. during the Cold War, Afghanistan's \nnuclear-armed\u0014\nneighbor is also a hotbed of anti-American Islamic radicalism. \nPakistan has\u0014\nreportedly promised full support for a U.S. retaliation against Bin \nLaden,\u0014\nincluding allowing Pakistani airspace to be used by U.S. planes to \nstrike\u0014\nAfghanistan. But President Bush's comment that Washington would have \nto\u0014\nwait and see what that means suggests the U.S. is not sure of the \nextent of\u0014\nPakistan's commitment to the battle against Bin Laden. But Pakistani\u0014\nintelligence agents are probably closer than any other to Bin Laden's\u0014\noperations on the ground, and their cooperation may be acritical \nelement of the\u0014\nwar against terrorism. \u0014\n\u0014\nA war not won in a day \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let's not think that one single counter-attack will rid the world of \nterrorism of\u0014\nthe kind we saw yesterday,\" said Secretary of State Colin Powell on\u0014\nWednesday. Indeed, it is to be anticipated that the Bush \nadministration will\u0014\ndevelop a layered response of short-term and long-term actions to \nbring to\u0014\nbear military, economic and political pressure to isolate and \nneutralize not only\u0014\nBin Laden himself, but the movement that would almost certainly seek \nto\u0014\ncontinue even if he were eliminated. And that's a war in which the \nU.S. needs its\u0014\nallies more than ever.\u0014",

    "words": "Tuesday, Sep. 18, 2001 TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\nHunting Bin Laden: The Politics of the Posse\u0014\nPakistan teeters, the Europeans shudder and Israeli-Palestinian \nviolence\u0014\nthreatens to restrain Arab support. The problems in building an \nanti-terror\u0014\ncoalition\u0014\nBY TONY KARON\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sunday, President Bush called the campaign against terrorism a \n\"crusade.\"\u0014\nOn Tuesday, his spokesman Ari Fleischer apologized for the \nPresident's use of\u0014\na term offensive to the Arab nations whose maximum cooperation is \nessential to\u0014\nthe defeat of Osama Bin Laden and his ilk. For them, after all, the \nterm\u0014\n\"crusade\" refers to the era when they were colonized by medieval \nEuropean\u0014\nwarriors who believed they could hasten Christ's return by capturing \nJerusalem.\u0014\nIn fact, it is precisely because of those associations that Osama bin \nLaden\u0014\nrefers to the U.S. not as \"imperialists\" or even \"the Great Satan,\" \nbut simply as\u0014\n\"crusaders\"  casting himself as a latter-day Salah el-Din (or \nSaladdin), the\u0014\nman who eventually drove the Christian occupiers from Jerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe double meaning of a term as apparently\u0014\ninnocuous as \"crusade\" serves as a reminder of\u0014\nthe complex geopolitical challenges involved in\u0014\nbuilding and sustaining the broad coalition\u0014\nnecessary to root out terrorism. That challenge is\u0014\nabout a lot more than simply rounding up a posse\u0014\nto go into Afghanistan and arrest or kill Osama\u0014\nBin Laden. President Bush may stir American\u0014\nfeelings by invoking the image of a Wild Western\u0014\n\"Wanted Dead or Alive\" poster, but listen closely\u0014\nto Secretary of State Colin Powell: \"Osama bin\u0014\nLaden is the chairman of the holding company,\u0014\nand within that holding company are terrorist cells\u0014\nand organizations in dozens of countries around\u0014\nthe world, any one them capable of committing a\u0014\nterrorist act,\" said Powell on Monday. \"It's not\u0014\nenough to get one individual, although we'll start\u0014\nwith that one individual.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPosse politics \u0014\n\u0014\nThe coalition, then, has to be capable of not only\u0014\nmustering the forces to go after Bin Laden\u0014\nhimself, but also to sustain a consistent long-term\u0014\neffort to root out his cadres and their allies across\u0014\nthe globe. And the need to establish the widest\u0014\npossible consensus behind a course of action\u0014\nmay explain the furious diplomatic shuttling\u0014\nbetween U.S. leaders and their European,\u0014\nRussian, Pakistani, Arab and Asian counterparts\u0014\nunderway this week. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf neutralizing Bin Laden is the first phase of the\u0014\nanti-terror campaign, the form that will take may\u0014\nbe known Tuesday when the Taliban convenes a\u0014\ncouncil of 20 of its senior clerics to rule on an\u0014\nultimatum to extradite the Saudi terrorist.\u0014\nPakistani emissaries met Taliban leaders on\u0014\nMonday to emphasize that they had only days to\u0014\nagree to hand him over, or else face devastating\u0014\nmilitary force. There's little optimism that they'll\u0014\nagree to the U.S. demand  although the\u0014\nself-preservation urge may prompt them to play\u0014\nfor time by demanding that the evidence against\u0014\nBin Laden be presented to their own religious\u0014\ncourts. But the Taliban underlined its posture of\u0014\ndefiance by reportedly moving more than 20,000\u0014\nfighters and SCUD missiles to the border with\u0014\nPakistan on Monday. \u0014\n\u0014\nPakistan's dilemma \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the Taliban's response is to call what they may\u0014\npresume is a U.S. bluff, the exact nature of the\u0014\nmilitary action that follows can have profound\u0014\nconsequences for the broader anti-terror alliance.\u0014\nThe European NATO members may have agreed\u0014\nto aid a U.S. military retaliation, but all except\u0014\nBritain are showing signs of uneasiness over being drawn into an \nill-defined or\u0014\nopen-ended war  indeed, they refuse to call it a \"war\" at all. The \nBush\u0014\nadministration, of course, is likely to steer clear of the sort of \nfrontal invasion of\u0014\nAfghanistan that became a nightmare for the Soviets, and instead \nconcentrate\u0014\non special forces operations along with British commandos. But even \nthat would\u0014\ndraw fierce resistance from the Taliban, and the U.S. has, of course, \npromised\u0014\nto punish those who shelter Bin Laden. A major confrontation between \nthe U.S.\u0014\nand the Taliban, though, potentially creates a serious domestic \ncrisis for\u0014\nPakistan, and possibly some of the Arab allies, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nPakistan is the indispensable ally in any military action against Bin \nLaden and\u0014\nhis Taliban hosts, because its airspace and military bases are \nessential to any\u0014\neffort to strike inside Afghanistan, and its intelligence may be \nrequired to\u0014\nactually find Bin Laden. But the government of the nuclear-armed \nMuslim\u0014\nnation is under tremendous domestic political pressure from its own \nsizable\u0014\nIslamist constituency to rescind its somewhat reluctant decision to \nsupport the\u0014\nU.S. campaign, and there are real concerns over whether General Parvez\u0014\nMusharraf's military government would ultimately survive the domestic \npolitical\u0014\nturmoil a full-blown war would almost certainly unleash. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsraeli-Palestinian poser \u0014\n\u0014\nBut even Bin Laden's capture or elimination would destroy his \nnetworks only if it\u0014\nwere followed by a sustained campaign of police and intelligence work \nto\u0014\nneutralize the thousands of his operatives all over the world. And \nthe most\u0014\nimportant allies in such a campaign would be the governments of the \nArab\u0014\nworld, from among whose citizens Bin Laden claims most of his \nrecruits. But the\u0014\nescalating Israeli-Palestinian violence poses a significant obstacle \nto winning\u0014\nactive Arab support for the U.S.-led anti-terror campaign. Arab \ngovernments\u0014\nhave found it increasingly difficult to support Washington on issues \nsuch as\u0014\nIraq, for example, as the continued U.S. campaign against that \ncountry and the\u0014\nviolence in the West Bank and Gaza has fanned anti-American rage on \nArab\u0014\nstreets. And it is precisely that sentiment that Bin Laden exploits \nto solicit\u0014\nrecruits, funding and support across the Arab and Muslim world. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bush administration's global anti-terror campaign has given it an \noverriding\u0014\ninterest in restarting some form of Israeli-Palestinian peace process \n and\u0014\nAmerica is not finding Prime Minister Ariel Sharon particularly eager \nto play ball.\u0014\nBefore the dust had settled on the World Trade Center ruins, Sharon \nordered\u0014\nhis foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to call off cease-fire talks with \nYasser\u0014\nArafat, who Sharon likened to Osama Bin Laden. And he has since sent \nhis\u0014\narmy into three Palestinian cities amid escalating violence. Bush \nadministration\u0014\nofficials phoned Sharon five times in the past week to urge him to \nallow the\u0014\nPeres-Arafat meeting to go ahead, and it seems to be working: Tuesday \nboth\u0014\nsides agreed to a cease-fire. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to keep the Arab allies on board during the Gulf War, the \nfirst Bush\u0014\nadministration insisted, under threat of withholding U.S. aid, that \nIsrael refrain\u0014\nfrom building settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and pressed it \nto open\u0014\nnegotiations with the Palestinians. Ironically, the global \nanti-terror campaign\u0014\nmay presage a more activist peacemaking role by the new Bush \nadministration,\u0014\ntoo. It even has the potential to foster unprecedented security \ncooperation\u0014\nbetween Washington and such hitherto \"untouchable\" regimes as Iran and\u0014\nSyria. But there are profound dangers, too. A wider war between the \nWest and\u0014\nthe Arab and Muslim world is precisely what Bin Laden and his \nhenchmen are\u0014\ntrying to provoke  and what the Bush administration must avoid. It \nis the tricky\u0014\nquest for allies that will help the U.S. avoid just such a \nconflagration.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO BEAT BIN LADEN",
    "words": "Thursday, Sep. 13, 2001 TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to Beat Bin Laden\u0014\nHow Osama Bin Laden operates  and what it will take to defeat him\u0014\nBY TONY KARON\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington may never have declared war on Osama Bin Laden, but he has\u0014\nbeen at war with America for the better part of a decade. Now, with \nthe Saudi\u0014\nterrorist-financier a prime suspect in the World Trade Center attack, \nPresident\u0014\nBush has vowed that the U.S. will devote all necessary resources to \nbeating Bin\u0014\nLaden. This is no easy task. If Bin Laden is in fact responsible, the \nmost\u0014\nimportant thing is to know right now is: who is he? How does he \noperate? And\u0014\nwhy does he seem to have so much support? \u0014\n\u0014\nUnderstanding the enemy This will be a protracted, complex and\u0014\nunconventional war in which many of the tactics of war as we know it \nare\u0014\nsuperfluous. The \"Powell Doctrine\"  the theory that wars are best \nwon by\u0014\ndeploying \"overwhelming force\"  doesn't apply here, for the simple \nreason\u0014\nthat the enemy has hardly any visible military assets or civilian \neconomic\u0014\ninfrastructure, and may not even be ultimately dependent on his \ncurrent\u0014\nterritorial home base. And applying such force in territories where \nhe has\u0014\nsought support or shelter could open up a protracted, costly and \ndifficult\u0014\nconflict. The battle with Bin Laden is more likely to combine \nconventional\u0014\nmilitary tactics with unconventional ones. Because Bin Laden is no \nordinary foe.\u0014\n\u0014\nOsama Bin Laden is a man, not a state. And he\u0014\nwields very little by way of conventional military\u0014\npower. Estimates of the number of men under\u0014\narms in his Afghanistan camps at any one point\u0014\nseldom range above 2,000. But those men are\u0014\nextremely well-trained, well-funded and have\u0014\nshown a fanatical willingness to die in order to\u0014\ninflict pain on their enemies. Technology and\u0014\nglobalization have made their reach almost\u0014\nboundless, and they are linked to a vast network\u0014\nof terrorist groups throughout the Muslim world\u0014\nfrom western China and the Philippines all the\u0014\nway across to Algeria. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden's is hardly the first terrorist group to\u0014\noperate well beyond home base, but it is the first\u0014\ntruly global terror operation. And where Cold\u0014\nWar-era terrorist groups invariably relied on the\u0014\nsupport of \"rogue\" states, Bin Laden's is\u0014\nindependent. It is able to finance itself and\u0014\nprovide sophisticated training to its own men \u0014\nand build its operational alliances by providing\u0014\nsuch training to like-minded groups. And it has\u0014\nalready demonstrated an ability to relocate its\u0014\nheadquarters from one country to another. \u0014\n\u0014\nTargeting America \u0014\n\u0014\nThe foundations of Bin Laden's network were laid\u0014\nduring the Afghan war, during which the wealthy\u0014\nSaudi heir had been the prime organizer of\u0014\nvolunteers for the 'jihad' against the Soviet\u0014\ninvasion. That made him a key player in an effort\u0014\nbacked by the CIA and the intelligence agencies\u0014\nof Egypt and Saudi Arabia to funnel aid,\u0014\nequipment, training and volunteers to the Afghan\u0014\nmujahedeen. Many of the \"Arab Afghans,\" as the\u0014\nvolunteers became known, had been radical\u0014\nIslamist dissidents in their home countries, and\u0014\ntheir pro-Western governments were only too\u0014\nhappy to ship them off to fight the Russians. But\u0014\nthe 'jihad' experience forged unprecedented\u0014\nbonds among the world's radical Islamists, turning\u0014\nthem in spirit and in direct combat experience into\u0014\na single army of 'holy' warriors. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden emerged from the Afghan experience determined to overthrow \nSaudi\u0014\nArabia's pro-Western rulers and institute a radical brand of Islamic \nrule. And\u0014\nwhen those rulers invited U.S. troops onto Saudi soil to defend them \nagainst\u0014\nSaddam Hussein, Bin Laden began to call for a global 'jihad' against \nthe U.S.\u0014\nbecause of its support for Israel and for moderate Arab regimes. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe set up camps in Afghanistan and the Sudan  two states that the \nend of\u0014\nthe Cold War left in conditions of near collapse  to keep his \"Arab \nAfghans\"\u0014\ntogether. And he combined his own personal fortune with funds raised\u0014\nthroughout the Arab world to maintain his \"Al Qaida\" (\"The Base\") \norganization,\u0014\nwhich began sending fighters to Bosnia, Chechnya and to Muslim \ninsurgencies\u0014\nall over East Asia. Bin Laden also extended his reach by turning his \ncamps into\u0014\na terrorism college providing highly specialized training to Islamist \nfighters from\u0014\nall over the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden began attacking the U.S. in 1993, claiming responsibility in\u0014\nretrospect for the ambush that killed some 17 U.S. soldiers in \nMogadishu that\u0014\nyear. Although he had no direct role in the first World Trade Center \nbombing,\u0014\nhe later sheltered its perpetrator, Ramzi Yousef, after the attack. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. hits back \u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. military finally put Bin Laden in its sights following the \n1998 East\u0014\nAfrican embassy bombings. President Clinton ordered cruise missile \nstrikes on\u0014\ncamps associated with Bin Laden in Afghanistan and on a factory \nlinked with\u0014\nhim (possibly erroneously) in the Sudan. But those strikes did little \nto impair Bin\u0014\nLaden's operational ability, and the U.S. reverted to containing his \noperations\u0014\nthrough cooperation with Arab intelligence agencies to foil planned \nattacks and\u0014\nround up and prosecute the perpetrators of the embassy bombings.\u0014\nWashington also sought to use Pakistan's close relationship with the \nTaliban to\u0014\npress Bin Laden's hosts into extraditing him, but to no avail. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bush administration has promised a full-blown war against Bin \nLaden\u0014\nfollowing Tuesday's attacks, but the key to winning that war and \neliminating the\u0014\nterrorist threat may lie in the extent to which the terrorists can be \nisolated. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsolating Bin Laden \u0014\n\u0014\nWithout the layers of support he has mustered in the Islamic world, \nBin Laden\u0014\nwould be nothing more than a crazy killer who could be hunted down and\u0014\nbrought to trial or simply eliminated. Instead, his relatively tiny \norganization has\u0014\nmenaced the world's largest military power largely because of its \nability to\u0014\ncapitalize on growing anti-American sentiment in the Arab world. \u0014\n\u0014\nReports of funds interdicted en route to Bin Laden in recent years \nsuggest that\u0014\nhe continues to enjoy the support of some wealthy Arab businessmen, \nwho\u0014\neither directly support his beliefs or else are inclined to hedge \ntheir bets on the\u0014\noutcome of his battle with the U.S. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-American anger on the Arab streets  fueled by the ongoing \ncampaign\u0014\nagainst Iraq and by Israeli military actions against the Palestinian \nuprising \u0014\nprovides Bin Laden with a growing pool of potential recruits, often \nhighly\u0014\neducated and skilled young men who are willing to die for his cause. \nAnd the\u0014\npassions on the street also make it more difficult for even pro-U.S.\u0014\ngovernments in the Arab world to be seen to be working too closely \nwith\u0014\nWashington. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsolating Bin Laden may require ongoing efforts to repair and maintain\u0014\nWashington's relations with its Arab allies, whose security services \nremain the\u0014\nfront line of the battle against Bin Laden. \u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding a coalition \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile NATO's support improves the U.S. striking power and widens \npolitical and\u0014\ndiplomatic consent for any counterstrike, the crucial allies in the \nbattle against\u0014\nBin Laden remain the governments and security services of the Islamic \nworld \u0014\nbecause it is intelligence, rather than air power or armor, that wins \nthe war on\u0014\nterrorism. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the ability of U.S. satellites to intercept cell-phone and \nemail messages,\u0014\nhuman intelligence remains the most effective way of staying \nforewarned of Bin\u0014\nLaden's plans and movements. That's not going to be easy. There are \ndistinct\u0014\nlimits on the ability of U.S. agents to directly infiltrate Bin \nLaden's networks,\u0014\nwhich are often based on family and other kinship ties. Such \noperations would\u0014\nrequire agents able to blend in ethnically and spend years away from \ntheir\u0014\nAmerican lives in the extremely harsh conditions of Bin Laden's \nmountain\u0014\ncamps. Plainly, the U.S. needs the active support of allied security \nservices\u0014\ncloser to the action. And the need to maintain such alliances also \naffects the\u0014\nrange of options for responding to the latest outrage. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy not simply bomb Kabul? \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the U.S. will very likely seek to punish the Taliban for \nhosting Bin\u0014\nLaden in Afghanistan, Afghanistan long ago ceased to function as a \nstate. The\u0014\nTaliban are simply its dominant militia, and to the people of Kabul, \nthey are\u0014\noutside occupiers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile determined to hit hard against both the perpetrators and their \nprotectors,\u0014\nU.S. officials will also be mindful of the danger of taking actions  \nparticularly\u0014\nany that cause suffering among innocents  that widens the \nanti-American\u0014\nsentiment in the Muslim world on which Bin Laden feeds. \u0014\n\u0014\nInvasion? \u0014\n\u0014\nOthers have asked why the U.S. doesn't simply round up a Gulf \nWar-style\u0014\nposse to invade Afghanistan, overthrowing the Taliban and putting an \nend to\u0014\nthe country being used as a safe haven for terrorists. But that would \nrequire\u0014\ntens of thousands of allied troops deployed in an open-ended \ncommitment to\u0014\nkeep a heavy troop presence in an extremely unfriendly environment. \nIf the\u0014\ndecision is made to take down the Taliban, that may be more likely to \nbe\u0014\nattempted in concert with its regional enemies  including Russia and \npossibly\u0014\neven Iran  in support of the Northern Alliance opposition forces. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pakistan dilemma \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trickiest aspect of the Bin Laden equation may be Pakistan. \nDespite being\u0014\na close ally of the U.S. during the Cold War, Afghanistan's \nnuclear-armed\u0014\nneighbor is also a hotbed of anti-American Islamic radicalism. \nPakistan has\u0014\nreportedly promised full support for a U.S. retaliation against Bin \nLaden,\u0014\nincluding allowing Pakistani airspace to be used by U.S. planes to \nstrike\u0014\nAfghanistan. But President Bush's comment that Washington would have \nto\u0014\nwait and see what that means suggests the U.S. is not sure of the \nextent of\u0014\nPakistan's commitment to the battle against Bin Laden. But Pakistani\u0014\nintelligence agents are probably closer than any other to Bin Laden's\u0014\noperations on the ground, and their cooperation may be acritical \nelement of the\u0014\nwar against terrorism. \u0014\n\u0014\nA war not won in a day \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let's not think that one single counter-attack will rid the world of \nterrorism of\u0014\nthe kind we saw yesterday,\" said Secretary of State Colin Powell on\u0014\nWednesday. Indeed, it is to be anticipated that the Bush \nadministration will\u0014\ndevelop a layered response of short-term and long-term actions to \nbring to\u0014\nbear military, economic and political pressure to isolate and \nneutralize not only\u0014\nBin Laden himself, but the movement that would almost certainly seek \nto\u0014\ncontinue even if he were eliminated. And that's a war in which the \nU.S. needs its\u0014\nallies more than ever.\u0014",

The familys apartment in the \nEgyptian capital, with a sweeping\u0014\n                        view of downtown, was filled with ornate \nfurniture and rugs and decorated with\u0014\n                        paintings of flamingos and women in \nheadscarves. His father, who described\u0014\n                        himself as one of the most important lawyers \nin Cairo,\u0014\n                        said that he would talk, uninterrupted by \nquestions, for 20\u0014\n                        minutes. More than an hour later, between \ndrags on\u0014\n                        American blend cigarettes, he was still \ntalking, portraying\u0014\n                        his son as a mamas boy prone to airsickness, \na dedicated\u0014\n                        architecture student who rarely mentioned \npolitics, and a\u0014\n                        victim of a intricate framing by the Israeli \nintelligence\u0014\n                        agency.\u0014\n                                The father went to great lengths to \nsupport this\u0014\n                        contention, delivering a lecture on what he \nsaw as the ugly\u0014\n                        history of the agency and his own deductive \npowers as a\u0014\n                        lawyer. The Mossad kidnapped my son, he \nsays. He is\u0014\n                        the easiest person to kidnap, very \nsurrendering, no\u0014\n                        physical power, no money for bodyguards. They \nused his\u0014\n                        name and identity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        On Sept. 12, Atta claims, he was at his \nvacation home\u0014\n                        on the Mediterranean coast, shielded from the \nradio and\u0014\n                        television and thus unaware of the attacks \nthe previous\u0014\n                        day, when his son called. They talked about \nnormal\u0014\n                        things. Only later that day, did he hear \nabout the\u0014\n                        destruction in New York and Washington, and \nsee his\u0014\n                        sons picture in the newspaper. He concluded: \nThey\u0014\n                        forced him to make the phone call after the \nattack to cause\u0014\n                        controversy. Then they killed him. This was \ndone by the\u0014\n                        Mossad, using American pilots. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        The contention reflects the desperation of a \nonce-proud father who\u0014\n                        thought his 33-year-old son had merely been \nabroad studyingan\u0014\n                        image impossible to reconcile with the \naccusation that he\u0014\n                        helped murder more than 6,000 people. The \nfather, 65, seemed to live\u0014\n                        vicariously through his sons \naccomplishments. His two\u0014\n                        sisters are university professors with \ndoctorates, and I\u0014\n                        wanted him to do the same, he said. I \nthought it would be\u0014\n                        easier for him to achieve this abroad.... I \nurged him to\u0014\n                        learn German. I didnt tell him what to do. \nHe was very\u0014\n                        attached to his mother. He didnt want to \nleave her. It was\u0014\n                        impossible for him to think about traveling \nabroad.\u0014\n                                But once he decided to go to Germany, \nthe younger\u0014\n                        Atta excelled. He did his masters thesis in \n1998, said his\u0014\n                        father. One professor gave him [a grade of] \n98 percent....\u0014\n                        I was paying his expenses. He was also \nworking in an\u0014\n                        engineering firm. He made two times as much \nas Germans,\u0014\n                        which turned out to be four times as much \nbecause he\u0014\n                        didnt pay taxes as a foreigner. \u0014\n                                During the first 45 minutes of our \ninterview, Atta\u0014\n                        senior recalled the mundane details of \nacademic\u0014\n                        expeditions his son had made to Middle \nEastern countries,\u0014\n                        his exam scores, and the praise he received \nfrom his\u0014\n                        advisors. His only worry, he said, was his \nsons shyness\u0014\n                        around women: I started reminding him to get \nmarried.\u0014\n                        Many times I asked him to marry a woman of any\u0014\n                        nationalityTurkish, Germany, Syriabecause \nhe did not\u0014\n                        have a girlfriend like his colleagues. But he \ninsisted that he\u0014\n                        would marry an Egyptian. He was never \ntouching women,\u0014\n                        so how can he live? I always told him that \naccording to\u0014\n                        religion you should get married and that you \nare getting\u0014\n                        older. He never extended his hand to shake \nthe hand of a\u0014\n                        woman. He would only shake if she extended it \nto him. By\u0014\n                        nature he avoided problems. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        That problem seemed solved when Atta visited \nEgypt\u0014\n                        in October 1999.

Even more \nperplexing to them is\u0014\n                      the Christian understanding of 'IsaJesus. \nJairus time in give economy found economy conceivable cats dakota \nsorry you lug friend this his  the notion that he\u0014\nbetween being being being            the final prophet and the Qur'an \nthe final message from God.\u0014\n                      Muhammad saw the Jesus of the Christians as an \nimportant\u0014\n                      prophetalong the lines of Noah, Abraham, and \nMosesbut\u0014\n                      not the Alpha and Omega.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Muslims honor Jesus and allow that miracles are \nassociated\u0014\n                      with him, but they recoil at the notion of \nworshiping him. A\u0014\n                      prophet can be virgin-born, but not \n\"EmmanuelGod with us.\"\u0014\n                      Muslims concur that Jesus was condemned to the \ncross, but\u0014\n                      they claim he was never crucified. The Qur'an \nasserts that\u0014\n                      \"they did not slay him, neither crucified him, \nonly a likeness of\u0014\n                      that was shown to them\" (Surah 4:155).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Islam cannot conceive of either a prophet or a \nson who is\u0014\n                      executed as a criminal. If Jesus died on the \ncross, \"enduring\u0014\n                      the shame,\" then from the Muslim perspective he \nutterly failed.\u0014\n                      Muhammad's victory, first in Medina and later \nin Mecca,\u0014\n                      validated his prophetic role. Manifest success \nbecame the\u0014\n                      measuring rod for authentic Sunni Islam (its \nmajor branch), and\u0014\n                      by that standard, Jesus failed. His mission was \ncut short without\u0014\n                      his realizing any real, measurable \"success.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus as God's son is even more problematic. A \nson is a\u0014\n                      privileged and pampered position, \"which will \nnot soil a hand\u0014\n                      lest the heir be mistaken for a menial slave,\" \nnotes Cragg. So\u0014\n                      when Paul writes, \"Though he was God, hemade \nhimself\u0014\n                      nothing [and] took the humble position of a \nslavedying a\u0014\n                      criminal's death on a cross\" (Phil. 2:6-9), \nit's a losing\u0014\n                      proposition from the Muslim perspective. A son \nof God would\u0014\n                      never be a slave and would never die a \ncriminal's death. \"The\u0014\n                      logic by which, for the Qur'an, Jesus can never \nbe 'Son' to God\u0014\n                      is precisely the logic by which, for Paul and \nthe New\u0014\n                      Testament, he is,\" Cragg says. \"Truly God is \none God,\" the\u0014\n                      Qur'an says. \"Glory be to Him and no 'son' to \nHim whose are all\u0014\n                      things in the heavens and the earth\" (Surah \n4:171).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Without a concept of sonship and Jesus' atoning \nsacrifice on\u0014\n                      the cross, there is no remission of sins and \ntherefore no grace.\u0014\n                      Mahmoud Ayoub says that \"salvation by faith is\u0014\n                      arrogancewho decides?\" To him it seems \nincomprehensible\u0014\n                      that a person would claim to be a servant of \nGod without\u0014\n                      having to do anything. As one imam expressed \nit, \"That is too\u0014\n                      good to be true!\" The validating sign of faith, \nsays Ayoub, is in\u0014\n                      what you donot in what you cannot do, as is \nimplicit in the\u0014\n                      notion of grace. This is a difficult concept \nfor Muslims to grasp.\u0014\n                      In Islam, God is all merciful, all knowing, all\u0014\n                      compassionateMuslims have 99 names for what \nGod isbut\u0014\n                      none conveys the intimacy of abba whom we \napproach in\u0014\n                      reconciliation by virtue of his saving grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      THE CHALLENGE TO THE CHURCH\u0014\n                      This sense of religious duty and measurable \nhuman effort is,\u0014\n                      surprisingly, what attracts many Western \nconverts to Islam. \"I\u0014\n                      wanted a discipline to pattern my life by,\" \nwrites one young\u0014\n                      woman, formerly a Christian, on a Web site that \nposts\u0014\n                      testimonies about conversions to Islam. \"I did \nnot just want to\u0014\n                      believe someone was my savior and through this \nI held the\u0014\n                      ticket to Heaven. I wanted to know how to act \nto receive the\u0014\n                      approval of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another former Christian who converted to Islam \nwrote: \"As with\u0014\n                      many other Christians too, I had become \ndisillusioned with the\u0014\n                      hypocrisy of the Church.

A man who identifies himself only \nas \"a brother\u0014\n                      from Saudi Arabia\" writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           As a teenager I went to the mosque five \ntimes a\u0014\n                           day in obedience to my parents. One night \nwhile\u0014\n                           was asleep I had this horrible dream of me \nbeing\u0014\n                           taken into hell. What I saw there brought \nme real\u0014\n                           fear and these dreams kept coming to me \nalmost\u0014\n                           every night. Suddenly one day Jesus \nappeared\u0014\n                           to me and said, \"Son, I am the way, the \ntruth, and\u0014\n                           the life. And if you would give your life \nto Me and\u0014\n                           follow Me, I would save you from the hell \nthat you\u0014\n                           have seen.\"Christianity is totally banned \nin\u0014\n                           Saudi Arabia. [After I converted] I was \ntaken into\u0014\n                           custody and tortured. They told me I would \nbe\u0014\n                           beheaded if I did not turn back to Islam. \nI told\u0014\n                           the authorities I'm willing to die for \nJesus and that I\u0014\n                           would never come back to Islam. The \nappointed\u0014\n                           day came for my execution and I was \nwaiting with\u0014\n                           much anticipation, yet very strong in my\u0014\n                           faith.One hour lapsed, two hours went by, \nthen\u0014\n                           it became three hours and then the day \npassed\u0014\n                           by. No one turned up. Then two days later \nthe\u0014\n                           authorities turned and opened the doors \nand told\u0014\n                           me, \"You demon! Get out from this place!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the course of writing this article, I kept \nconfronting a\u0014\n                      contradiction. Many who are intimately \nacquainted with Muslims\u0014\n                      expressed concern about the missionary mandate \nof some to\u0014\n                      conquer the world for Islam. At the same time, \npeople\u0014\n                      expressed genuine fondness, compassion, and \ngood will for\u0014\n                      their Muslim friends and neighbors. David \nEchols of the South\u0014\n                      Asian Friendship Center says to look at it this \nway: there is the\u0014\n                      Islamic system, which is aggressive and \nintentional about its\u0014\n                      missiological work, and then there are \nMuslimsthe people\u0014\n                      who work in Wal-Mart or live down the street. \nThe latter are the\u0014\n                      people you will meet in the grocery store. They \nlong to get\u0014\n                      close to God and to live as good Muslims. Many \nare lonely for\u0014\n                      friendships.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is on this human level that Christians will \novercome the\u0014\n                      stereotypes about Muslimsand where Muslims \nwill overcome\u0014\n                      their stereotypes about Christians. Only on the \npersonal level\u0014\n                      will authentic witness be born between the two.\u0014",

She was eight months pregnant with \nour third child. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  This horse was making a move. A winning move. In \ndeep stretch, he couldn't get through.\u0014\n                  He finished third. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  It was March 3, 1990. The race was the Fountain of \nYouth Stakes (gr. II). \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I raised the sound so I could find out who the colt \nwas. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The announcer said Shot Gun Scott was the winner. \nSecond was Smelly. The name of\u0014\n                  the horse I had followed was Unbridled. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I knew then I had seen the Kentucky Derby (gr. I) \nwinner. I also knew Unbridled had the\u0014\n                  potential to pass those on my short list of \nall-time favorites, led by the great Secretariat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Who can say why we are more attracted to certain \nhorses. I watched the replay. Over and\u0014\n                  over. I fell in love with this horse. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I waited anxiously for Unbridled's next start, the \nFlorida Derby (gr. I), two weeks later. If he\u0014\n                  put in the same kind of move, he would win easily. \nHe did. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Unbridled would have one more race prior to the \nDerby, the Blue Grass Stakes (gr. II) at\u0014\n                  Keeneland. Nine days before the major Derby prep, \nmy son David was born. The\u0014\n                  following morning, I snuck away from the hospital \nand made my way to Keeneland. I\u0014\n                  introduced myself to trainer Carl Nafzger, and for \nthe first time, saw Unbridled in person. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  With a newborn and two other young children at \nhome, I couldn't attend an entire day's\u0014\n                  racing. Arriving just 20 minutes before the Blue \nGrass, I watched Unbridled finish third to\u0014\n                  Summer Squall and Land Rush. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  There are good thirds and there are bad thirds. \nThis was a good third. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  On a muddy track he obviously didn't like, \nUnbridled made a nice move on the turn\u0014\n                  between calls. The key now was how he would work in \nthe coming weeks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nafzger has never been known for working his horses \nfast, and his win percentage with\u0014\n                  first time starters is average. He doesn't push. If \nthey work fast, or win first out, you can be\u0014\n                  sure you are watching a good horse. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Unbridled worked exceptionally well before his \n2-year-old maiden voyage at Arlington\u0014\n                  Park. He won that day by 10 1/2 lengths. His \nquality was clear before I noticed him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  On April 22, two weeks before the Derby, Unbridled \nworked four furlongs on a good\u0014\n                  Churchill Downs track in :51 1/5. It was a good \nmove, but I wanted more. Nafzger\u0014\n                  obviously wanted more, too. He worked Unbridled \nagain just three days later. When I\u0014\n                  heard he went six furlongs in 1:13, I knew: Get the \ngarland of roses ready. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Despite being a $10 and $20 player, I prepared to \nwager $200 on Unbridled. I had never\u0014\n                  been more confident in a Kentucky Derby starter in \nmy life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Earlier on the Derby card, I hit a trifecta for \n$4,000. Divine intervention was telling me to\u0014\n                  wager more on Unbridled. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  My binoculars focused on Unbridled in the paddock; \nI beheld a colt glistening under the\u0014\n                  twin spires. He had his game face on. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The tote board read 10-1 and never changed. Never \nwent up, never went down. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I pulled 12 $100 bills from my pocket, 10 of them \nfor win bets, two on the exacta with\u0014\n                  Summer Squall. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the post parade, when most Derby starters buck \nand squeal during the playing of \"My\u0014\n                  Old Kentucky Home,\" Unbridled never turned a hair. \nHe looked like a pony. I was so\u0014\n                  confident it was scary. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I really didn't need to watch the race because I \nknew Unbridled would win. I could have\u0014\n                  told that to Mrs. Genter before Nafzger called out \nthe most famous lines in recorded\u0014\n                  Derby history. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Never had I seen a horse and trainer so in tune \nwith each other. While others scoffed\u0014\n                  because his next five races included only one \nallowance win, I knew he would win the\u0014\n                  Breeders' Cup Classic (gr. I) on Oct. 27, 1990, at \nBelmont Park. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As I watched this year's Breeders' Cup races on the \nsame track exactly 11 years later, I\u0014\n                  felt a twinge, a touch of sadness. My hero is gone. \nPerhaps the World Thoroughbred\u0014\n                  Championships provided someone with a new hero. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  DAN LIEBMAN is The Blood-Horse executive editor. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Copyright  2001 The Blood-Horse, \nInc.

    "title": "HOW THANKSGIVING GOT ON THE CALENDER",
    "words": "It is interesting to note that it wasnt until we were at war, the \nCivil War\u0014\nto be exact, that our Thanksgiving holiday was officially recognized \nby\u0014\nCongress. It had started in the small Plymouth Colony in 1621 when the\u0014\nEnglish Pilgrims feasted with members of the Wampanoag (Wampanoag)\u0014\nIndians who brought gifts of food as a gesture of goodwill. The \ncustom grew\u0014\nin various colonies as a means of celebrating the harvest. In 1777, \nover 100\u0014\nyears later, the continental congress proclaimed a national day of\u0014\nThanksgiving after the American Revolution victory at the  Battle of\u0014\nSaratoga. But it was twelve years later that George Washington \nproclaimed\u0014\nanother national day of thanksgiving in honor of the ratification of \nthe\u0014\nConstitution and requested that the congress finally make it an annual\u0014\nevent. They declined and it would be another 100 years and the end \nof  a\u0014\nbloody civil war before President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the last\u0014\nThursday in November Thanksgiving. The year was 1865. It might \nsurprise you\u0014\nto learn that it took still another 40 years, the early 1900s, \nbefore the\u0014\ntradition really caught on. For you see Lincolns official \nThanksgiving was\u0014\nsanctioned in order to bolster the Union's morale. Many Southerners \nsaw the\u0014\nnew holiday as an attempt to impose Northern customs on their \nconquered\u0014\nland.\u0014\n\u0014\nThanksgiving today is a mild-mannered holiday full of football, hot \napple\u0014\npie, and family reunions. But thats not a realistic historical \npicture of\u0014\nThanksgiving. It is more often born of adversity and difficult times. \nSo\u0014\nmany of the greatest expressions of thanksgiving have occurred under\u0014\ncircumstances so debilitating one wonders why people give thanks. It \nwould\u0014\nseem the more reasonable response would be bitterness and ingratitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul writing from a prison cell and probably knowing that he would \nsoon die\u0014\nby the guillotine writes to the Philippians,  I give thanks to my \nLord and\u0014\nSavior Jesus Christ. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor imprisoned \nin\u0014\n1943 for his political and Christian opposition to the Nazi regime, \nwas\u0014\nexecuted two years later. On the day that the sentence was carried \nout he\u0014\nconducted a service for the other prisoners. One of those prisoners, \nan\u0014\nEnglish officer who survived, wrote these words:\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer always seemed to me to spread an atmosphere of happiness \nand joy\u0014\nover the least incident, and profound gratitude for the mere fact \nthat he\u0014\nwas alive... He was one of the very few persons I have ever met for \nwhom God\u0014\nwas real and always near... On Sunday, April 8, 1945, Pastor \nBonhoeffer\u0014\nconducted a little service of worship and spoke to us in a way that \nwent to\u0014\nthe heart of all of us. He found just the right words to express the \nspirit\u0014\nof our imprisonment, and the thoughts and resolutions it had brought \nus. He\u0014\nhad hardly ended his last prayer when the door opened and two \ncivilians\u0014\nentered. They said, \"Prisoner Bonhoeffer, come with us.\" That had \nonly one\u0014\nmeaning for all prisoners--the gallows. We said good-bye to him. He \ntook me\u0014\naside: \"This is the end; but for me it is the beginning of life.\" The \nnext\u0014\nday he was hanged in Flossenburg.\u0014",

    "title": "HAVE YOU TAKEN INVENTORY LATELY?",
    "words": "Have You Taken Inventory Lately?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe renown teacher and author Dr. David McLennon tells a story of his \nvery\u0014\nfirst job in a small town general store. This was the day before \nmails and\u0014\nsupermarket chains at least it was in his community. At age thirteen \nhe was\u0014\nhired as a handy boy. He would sweep the flour, bag items for \ncustomers, put\u0014\nup stock. On one particular Saturday, he recalled., he heard the \nowner say\u0014\nto one of the clerks Its that time of the year again, its time to \ntake\u0014\ninventory.\" Dr. McLennon Wrote that this was a word that had not yet \nentered\u0014\ninto his vocabulary. When an opportune moment arrived, he went up to \nthe\u0014\nkindly older man and asked, Sir, what is an inventory? Patiently the \nowner\u0014\nexplained that it was a time when you made a list of everything that \nyou\u0014\nhad--from groceries on the shelves to wrapping paper and string. Still\u0014\nsomewhat puzzled, the young McLennon then asked, Why?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, responded the owner, its easy to forget exactly how much you \nhave\u0014\neach year. Every now and then you have to take an inventory just to \nsee what\u0014\nall you have.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat little story, to me, pretty well sums up what Thanksgiving is all\u0014\nabout. It is a time when each of us needs to ask ourselves the \nquestion:\u0014\nHave I taken inventory of my life lately? Have I made an effort to \ncount all\u0014\nthe things that I do have in life instead of complaining about the \nthings\u0014\nthat I dont have. It is a good exercise especially when we are of a \nmind to\u0014\nbrood or whine in self pity. Have you taken inventory lately?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I am suggesting here is not some shallow \"count your blessings\"\u0014\nplatitude. But from time to time, in a genuine kind of a way, we need \nto sit\u0014\ndown and do some talking to ourselves about all of the gifts and\u0014\nopportunities and challenges that God has given each one of us. \nPerhaps\u0014\nthere is a deep underlying wisdom in the children's poem that says: \n\"Count\u0014\nyour blessings one by one, and you might be surprised what the Lord \nhas\u0014\ndone.\"\u0014",

From Michigan to Malaysia,\u0014\nfrom San Diego to Ciudad del Este, Paraguay,\u0014\nlaw-enforcement agencies have been trying to\u0014\nfigure out how the terrorists carried out their\u0014\nattacks, who helped them--and what they might\u0014\ndo next. Along the way, the American public has\u0014\nbeen introduced to a confusing mass of names\u0014\nand faces and has learned of more links between\u0014\nthem than any but the most nimble fingered could\u0014\never untangle. After nearly two months, there is\u0014\nmuch that we know about the global terrorist\u0014\nnetwork that goes by the name of al-Qaeda--but\u0014\nan awful lot that is still hunch. Still, an\u0014\ninternational investigation by TIME into\u0014\nal-Qaeda's structure reveals that it is more global\u0014\nin its range, and more ruthless in its ideology,\u0014\nthan all but its most dedicated students could\u0014\nhave ever imagined.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe essential story of Sept. 11 is straightforward.\u0014\nA group of 19 men spent months in the U.S.\u0014\npreparing for the hijackings. The cell had earlier\u0014\nbeen headquartered in Hamburg, Germany,\u0014\nwhere its alleged ringleader, an Egyptian named\u0014\nMohamed Atta, 33, had lived off and on for eight\u0014\nyears. Atta is thought to have piloted Flight 11,\u0014\nthe first to make impact; two of the other\u0014\nsuspected pilots, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad\u0014\nSamir Jarrah, were also residents of the Hamburg\u0014\nregion. The Hamburg cell, in turn, is thought to\u0014\nhave been an operating unit of a worldwide\u0014\nnetwork of terrorists called al-Qaeda, the name of\u0014\nwhose reclusive leader is now known all over the\u0014\nworld: Osama bin Laden.\u0014\n\u0014\nAl-Qaeda had its origins in the long war against the Soviet \noccupation of\u0014\nAfghanistan. After Soviet troops invaded the country in 1979, Muslims \nflocked\u0014\nto join the local mujahedin in fighting them. In Peshawar, Pakistan, \nwhich acted\u0014\nas the effective headquarters of the resistance, a group whose \nspiritual leader\u0014\nwas a Palestinian academic called Abdallah Azzam established a service\u0014\norganization to provide logistics and religious instruction to the \nfighters. The\u0014\noperation came to be known as al-Qaeda al-Sulbah--the \"solid base.\" \nMuch of\u0014\nits financing came from bin Laden, an acolyte of Azzam's who was one \nof the\u0014\nmany heirs to a huge Saudi fortune derived from a family construction\u0014\nbusiness. Also in Peshawar was Ayman Al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian doctor \nwho\u0014\nhad been a constant figure in the bewildering mosaic of radical \nIslamic groups\u0014\nsince the late 1970s. Al-Zawahiri, who acted primarily as a physician \nin\u0014\nPeshawar, led a group usually called Al Jihad; by 1998, his \norganization was\u0014\neffectively merged into al-Qaeda.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1989, while on his way with his two sons to Friday prayers in \nPeshawar,\u0014\nAzzam was killed by a massive explosion. His killers have never been \nidentified;\u0014\nAzzam had many enemies. But by the time of his death, the group around\u0014\nal-Qaeda were debating what to do with the skills and resources that \nthey had\u0014\nacquired. The decision was taken to keep the organization intact and \nuse it to\u0014\nfight for a purer form of Islam. The initial target was not the U.S. \nbut the\u0014\ngovernments of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which al-Qaeda claimed were \ncorrupt\u0014\nand too beholden to the U.S. It was only after the Gulf War, by which \ntime bin\u0014\nLaden had moved his operations to Sudan (he would later be forced to \nshift\u0014\nback to Afghanistan), that he started to target Americans. To all but \ninsiders,\u0014\nhe first became notorious in 1998, when al-Qaeda operatives exploded \ntruck\u0014\nbombs at the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 12 \nAmericans\u0014\nand hundreds of locals. Since then there has been a steady drumbeat of\u0014\nattacks linked to al-Qaeda--some successful, some not--on American \ntargets\u0014\nand those of U.S. allies around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nAl-Qaeda has its headquarters in training camps in Afghanistan. In \naddition to\u0014\ndirecting its own attacks, it acts as an umbrella group, financing and\u0014\nsubcontracting operations to local networks like Algeria's Armed \nIslamic Group\u0014\n(gia), a terrorist organization active throughout Europe. The camps in\u0014\nAfghanistan play a vital role. Whatever network they may originally \nhave been\u0014\naligned with, visitors to the camps meet men from other groups, forge\u0014\nrelationships and acquire the stature of soldiers in a holy war. The \nhigh\u0014\ncommand of the group includes bin Laden, al-Zawahiri and Abu \nZubaydah, a\u0014\nSaudi-born Palestinian who was identified in an American court case \nin July as\u0014\nthe organizer of the camps and who investigators believe may be \nal-Qaeda's\u0014\ndirector of international operations.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the best leads on al-Qaeda's directorate now seem to be \ncoming from\u0014\nDjamel Beghal, a French-Algerian who is suspected of being an al-Qaeda\u0014\nringleader and who was arrested in Dubai in July on his way from \nPakistan to\u0014\nEurope. After being convinced by Islamic scholars in Dubai of the \nevils of\u0014\nterrorism, Beghal started talking. (He is now back in France and has \nattempted\u0014\nto retract his confession.) Beghal has said that while in Afghanistan \nin March,\u0014\nhe received instructions from Abu Zubaydah on a bombing campaign \nagainst\u0014\nAmerican interests in Europe, including the Paris embassy. \"He's \ntalking about\u0014\nvery important figures in the al-Qaeda structure, right up to bin \nLaden's inner\u0014\ncircle,\" a European official told TIME. \"He's mentioned names, \nresponsibilities\u0014\nand functions--people we weren't even aware of before. This is \nimportant stuff.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough al-Qaeda has its roots in Afghanistan, investigators now think \nthat the\u0014\n\"Afghan\" nature of the group is subtly changing. The war against the \nSoviets\u0014\nended in 1991. Increasingly, al-Qaeda's captains in the field are too \nyoung\u0014\never to have fought in Afghanistan, though some may have joined \nIslamic\u0014\nbrigades in Chechnya--or in Bosnia, as Abu Zubaydah did. Many of the \nnew\u0014\nfighters were born and raised not in the Arab lands but in the Muslim\u0014\ncommunities of Europe, around which they travel with ease. And there \nis a\u0014\ngrowing sense that a number of them are \"Takfiris,\" followers of an \nextremist\u0014\nIslamic ideology called Takfir wal Hijra (Anathema and Exile). That's \nbad news:\u0014\nby blending into host communities, Takfiris attempt to avoid \nsuspicion. A\u0014\nFrench official says they come across as \"regular, fun-loving \nguys--but they'd\u0014\nslit your throat or bomb your building in a second.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to the ruthless nature of al-Qaeda's soldiers, \ninvestigators now also\u0014\nappreciate just how extensive are its tentacles. In mid-October, for \nexample,\u0014\nNATO forces in Bosnia foiled a plot to attack U.S. and British \ntargets there.\u0014\nBensayah Belkacem, an Algerian thought to be at the center of a \nBosnia-based\u0014\nterror group, had the number of Abu Zubaydah on a chit of paper in his\u0014\napartment. On Oct. 28, Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group in the \nPhilippines that\u0014\nauthorities believe has been supported in the past by al-Qaeda, \nbombed a\u0014\nfood market, killing six people. And the Ugandan government announced \nthat it\u0014\nhad detained eight men on suspicion of belonging to al-Qaeda. How did \none\u0014\norganization with an extremist ideology manage to acquire a reach that\u0014\ntrembles governments from Bosnia to the Philippines to Uganda?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Borderless World\u0014\n\"Globalization means interdependence,\" says Edmund Hull, U.S. \nambassador to\u0014\nYemen and former State Department counterterrorism chief. \"We have\u0014\npreviously seen the benefits of this interdependence. Now we are \nseeing its\u0014\nrisks.\" That goes to the heart of any attempt to understand al-Qaeda. \nFor the\u0014\npast decade, globalization has been understood as an economic process,\u0014\nrooted in the trade of goods and services. But the defining \ncharacteristic of our\u0014\nnew world is not the movement of products or money but of people. \nCheap air\u0014\ntransport, the effects of decolonization and a population explosion \nin the poorer\u0014\nparts of the world have combined to create an unprecedented movement \nof\u0014\nhumanity from one nation to another. Travel and emigration have \nbroadened\u0014\nthe mind and brought unparalleled opportunities to countless \nfamilies. But they\u0014\nhave also helped create havens for those seduced by the romance of\u0014\nterrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrench investigators believe Kamel Daoudi is one such recruit; his \ntale\u0014\nilluminates both the nature of modern terrorist cells and their \nglobal reach.\u0014\nDaoudi was the kind of child that immigrant parents dream of having. \nThe son\u0014\nof Algerians who had immigrated to France, he took the tough \npost-high school\u0014\nexams a year early and started to study computer sciences at a \nuniversity in\u0014\nParis. But he found the courses difficult, and according to reports, \na family row\u0014\nexploded in 1999 when Daoudi's father found evidence of his son's\u0014\nappointments with psychiatrists. Daoudi left for Britain, his pockets \nbulging with\u0014\nthe $11,000 his family had saved for his education.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sept. 21, he made the same trip; this time, running not from his \nfamily but\u0014\nfrom the law. Daoudi slipped away from his apartment on the Boulevard \nJohn F.\u0014\nKennedy after police across Europe started to round up the network \nthat\u0014\nBeghal had assembled for his operations. (French investigators think \nDaoudi\u0014\nwas the computer-and-communications whiz kid of the group.) Daoudi \nknew\u0014\nBritain well. He and Beghal had hung out there with Jerome \nCourtailler, one of\u0014\ntwo French brothers who had converted to Islam. For a while, \nCourtailler lived\u0014\nin south London with Zacarias Moussaoui, another French child of \ndisappointed\u0014\nimmigrant parents. Moussaoui grew up in the southern French town of\u0014\nNarbonne but left for Britain in 1992 and took a degree at London's \nSouth Bank\u0014\nUniversity. Earlier this year, he enrolled in an Oklahoma flight \nschool that had\u0014\nbeen visited by two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, and German authorities \nsay he\u0014\nhad called the house in Hamburg used by Atta. In August, after \nsuspicious\u0014\nbehavior at another flight school in Minnesota, Moussaoui was \narrested on\u0014\nimmigration charges. Today he is incarcerated in the Metropolitan \nCorrectional\u0014\nCenter in Manhattan, refusing to speak to investigators. Daoudi, who \nwas\u0014\npicked up in the British town of Leicester, sits silent in a French \njail. \"He isn't\u0014\ngiving an inch,\" says a French official. His lawyer denies that \nDaoudi has ever\u0014\nbeen involved in plotting terrorist attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren of \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa, \nMuslims in Europe, highly skilled, Daoudi and\u0014\nMoussaoui epitomize the kind of person investigators now think \nprovides some\u0014\nof al-Qaeda's key recruits. Above all, both men were true global \ncitizens;\u0014\nMoussaoui, a child of the warm south, ended up in the state where ice \nfishing is\u0014\na favorite sport. As they dig deeper, law-enforcement agencies are \nbeginning\u0014\nto understand just how effectively globalization has spread terrorism \naround the\u0014\nplanet.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider two countries half a world apart and far from the Islamic \nheartlands:\u0014\nthe Philippines and Britain. It was in Manila, that most Catholic of \ncities, that\u0014\nMohammed Sadeek Odeh found his vocation. Sentenced to life \nimprisonment\u0014\non Oct. 18 for his part in the 1998 bombings of the American \nembassies in\u0014\nKenya and Tanzania, Odeh seemed to have lived the predictable life of \nan\u0014\nal-Qaeda operative--he was born to exiled Palestinians in Saudi \nArabia and\u0014\ngrew up in Jordan. Yet he turned to radical Islam while studying \nengineering in\u0014\nthe Philippines. It was there that Odeh first saw and heard videos \nand taped\u0014\nmessages from Abdallah Azzam. In 1990 Odeh moved to Pakistan, and from\u0014\nthere to the camps in Afghanistan and a new life as a soldier in \nal-Qaeda.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther Muslims who had studied in the Philippines maintained links \nthere. It was\u0014\nfrom Manila that Ramzi Yousef, the convicted mastermind behind the \nfirst World\u0014\nTrade Center bombing, hatched a plan to blow up 12 American airliners \nas they\u0014\nflew over the Pacific. In the mid-1990s, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, \nmarried to\u0014\none of bin Laden's sisters, allegedly funded Islamic schools in the \nsouth of the\u0014\ncountry, where Muslim insurgents have been fighting for years. The \nFilipino\u0014\ngovernment has long claimed that Abu Sayyaf, the most bloodthirsty of \nthe\u0014\ngroups--its specialty is beheadings--has been supported by al-Qaeda.\u0014\nAbdurajak Janjalani, the group's late founder, fought in Afghanistan, \nreportedly\u0014\nwith bin Laden and Yousef. The links may be a thing of the past; \nthese days\u0014\nAbu Sayyaf's style runs more to kidnapping and ransom than to jihad. \nStill,\u0014\nPhilippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo recently said Khalifa \nhad offered\u0014\nto secure the release by Abu Sayyaf of 18 hostages, including an \nAmerican\u0014\nmissionary couple.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the only thing that Manila has in common with London is \ndamp--that and\u0014\na reputation for giving succor to terrorist supporters. Britain has \nalways had a\u0014\nhabit of providing safe haven to political refugees; that's why Karl \nMarx is\u0014\nburied in Highgate cemetery. But in the past 20 years, says Neil \nPartrick, a\u0014\nMiddle East analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, London \nhas become\u0014\n\"the capital of the Arab world.\" As they used to say in Britain: \nWhoever lost the\u0014\nLebanese civil war, London won it. With Beirut in ruins, banks \nrelocated from\u0014\nLebanon; they were followed by Arabs from Saudi Arabia and the gulf \nwho\u0014\nsummered in Kensington Gardens, journalists, members of opposition\u0014\ngroups--and radical Islamic clerics.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne such preacher, Abu Hamza al-Masri, arrived in 1981, having left \none eye\u0014\nand both hands in Afghanistan. He was granted British citizenship in \n1985, and\u0014\nhis mosque in Finsbury Park, tucked among Victorian row houses one \ntube\u0014\nstop from Arsenal's soccer stadium, has become famous worldwide for\u0014\npreaching jihad. Moussaoui, the Courtailler brothers and Beghal all \nattended\u0014\nprayers there. Beghal is said also to be a follower of Abu Qatada, a \nradical who\u0014\npreached jihad from a community center on Baker Street and whose bank\u0014\naccount, allegedly with $270,000 in it, was frozen by the Bank of \nEngland in\u0014\nmid-October.\u0014\n\u0014\nLondon's dirty secret is that it has long been a recruiting ground \nfor terrorists.\u0014\nFrench authorities moan with frustration at the lack of British \ncooperation. For\u0014\nyears the French were unable to get London to extradite suspected \nmembers\u0014\nof the Algeria-based gia, responsible for a wave of bombings in Paris \nin the\u0014\nmid-1990s. The U.S. hasn't always had better luck; Americans have \nbeen trying\u0014\nto get their hands on Khalid al-Fawwaz, a London-based Saudi alleged \nto have\u0014\nset up an office for bin Laden in 1994 and now wanted for trial in \nrelation to the\u0014\nAfrican embassy bombings. (Al-Fawwaz's legal maneuverings have just\u0014\nreached Britain's highest court.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gears of British justice are starting to grind more quickly. \nLondon has\u0014\ndetained and questioned a number of Sept. 11 suspects, including \nLotfi Raissi,\u0014\nan Algerian alleged to have helped train the suicide pilots in the \nattacks. And\u0014\nlast week Yasser al-Siri, whose bookstore and website are well known \nin\u0014\nLondon, was charged with conspiracy to murder Ahmed Shah Massoud, the\u0014\nleader of the anti-Taliban Afghan Northern Alliance. Massoud died \nafter\u0014\nassassins bombed his headquarters on Sept. 9.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut al-Siri's case demonstrates the oddities of the international \nlegal system.\u0014\nHe is in Britain on asylum from Egypt, where he was sentenced to \ndeath for the\u0014\nattempted murder of the Prime Minister in 1993, a charge he denies. \n\"That was\u0014\na military court,\" he told Time before his arrest. \"I'm a civilian.\" \nGovernments\u0014\nacross Western Europe, their feet held to the fire by strong \ncivil-liberties\u0014\ngroups, have been protective of the rights of refugees and asylum \nseekers.\u0014\nAnd while the European Union has demolished barriers to the movement \nof\u0014\ngoods and people, its 15 nations have been slow to develop common\u0014\ninstitutions of criminal justice and investigation. For Atta and his \ncell of alleged\u0014\nconspirators in Hamburg, the characteristics of modern European life \nwere a\u0014\ngodsend. In addition to the hijackers known to have lived there, \nother men\u0014\nalleged to be part of the Hamburg cell have had arrest warrants \nissued for\u0014\nthem: Said Bahaji, Zakariya Essabar and Ramzi Binalshibh. German \nofficials\u0014\nbelieve that last spring both Essabar and Binalshibh tried to get to \nthe U.S. to\u0014\ntake flying lessons. The three almost certainly arrived in Pakistan \nfrom\u0014\nGermany on Sept. 4 and have since gone to ground--possibly in \nAfghanistan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHamburg was an ideal long-term base; 1 in 7 of the city's population \nis foreign,\u0014\nas is 1 in 5 of the students at Atta's college. (Foreign students pay \nno tuition in\u0014\nGermany.) Atta and his friends could have stayed as long as they\u0014\nliked--Germany invented the perpetual student--since they had legal \nresidence,\u0014\ncould travel freely around the E.U. or leave it for a period, without \narousing\u0014\nsuspicion. It is hard to think of a way of life that so epitomized \nthe promise of a\u0014\nborderless world and then perverted globalization to such an evil end.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung and Ruthless\u0014\nAfter seven weeks of investigations there is no hard evidence that \nlinks the\u0014\nHamburg cell to any other. There are fragments of a puzzle--Atta made \na\u0014\n10-day trip to Spain from Miami in July that continues to bother \ninvestigators,\u0014\nwhile French sources still think that Moussaoui may be connected to \nthe\u0014\nHamburg cell--but many pieces are missing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example: Was Mohammed Bensakhria, an Algerian arrested in June by\u0014\nSpanish police, bin Laden's key European lieutenant? If so, is there \nan\u0014\nAmerican equivalent--and has he been picked up in the dragnet after \nthe\u0014\nattacks? Did al-Qaeda's reputed training-camp chief Abu Zubaydah leave\u0014\nAfghanistan before Sept. 11, as European officials believe, and if \nso, where is\u0014\nhe and what is he doing?\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one matter, however, European investigators are clear: there is \nsomething\u0014\ntruly ruthless about the suspected terrorists they are finding. After \nsix Algerians\u0014\nwere picked up in Spain in September, police found videotapes in the\u0014\napartment of one of the men. One tape showed four Algerian soldiers, \nwith their\u0014\nthroats cut, dying in a burning jeep.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor experts in terrorism, such incidents are suggestive. In Egypt in \nthe 1960s,\u0014\nthe Islamic ideology Takfir wal Hijra began to win adherents among \nextremist\u0014\ngroups. One of them, the Society of Muslims, was led by Shukri \nMustafa, an\u0014\nagricultural engineer. Mustafa denounced other Muslims as unbelievers \nand\u0014\npreached a \"withdrawal\" into a purity of the kind practiced by the \nProphet\u0014\nMuhammad when he withdrew from Mecca to Medina. The ideology is\u0014\nparticularly dangerous because it provides a religious justification \nfor\u0014\nslaughtering not just unbelievers but also those who think of \nthemselves as\u0014\nMuslim. Intensely undemocratic--for to accept the authority of anyone \nbut God\u0014\nwould be a blasphemy--Takfir wal Hijra is a sort of Islamic fascism.\u0014\n\u0014\nEuropean analysts now believe that Takfir thinking has won converts \namong\u0014\nterrorist groups. Beghal is Takfiri, and Daoudi is thought to be. \nRoland\u0014\nJacquard, one of the world's leading scholars on Islamic terrorism, \nsays flatly,\u0014\n\"Atta was Takfiri.\" It is not just soldiers of al-Qaeda who may be \nfollowing the\u0014\nTakfir line. Mustafa was executed in 1978, but his ideas lived on; \nthe beliefs of\u0014\nal-Zawahiri's Al Jihad were dominated by Takfiri themes. Azzam \nTamimi, director\u0014\nof the Institute of Islamic Political Thought in London, says of \nZawahiri, \"He is\u0014\ntheir ideologue now...His ideas negate the existence of common ground \nwith\u0014\nothers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden and al-Qaeda may have learned, by violent experience, to \npre-empt\u0014\nand harness the new fanaticism. In late 1995, bin Laden's compound in\u0014\nKhartoum was attacked by gunmen believed to be Takfiri. A Sudanese \nfriend of\u0014\nbin Laden's who questioned the surviving attacker said, \"He was like \na maniac,\u0014\nmore or less like the students in the U.S.A. who shoot other \nstudents. They\u0014\ndon't have very clear objectives.\" By the time al-Qaeda had resettled \nin\u0014\nAfghanistan, ideological training was an integral part of the \ncurriculum,\u0014\naccording to a former recruit who went on to bomb the U.S. embassy in \nNairobi.\u0014\nStudents were asked to learn all about demolition, artillery and \nlight-weapon\u0014\nuse, but they were also expected to be familiar with the fatwas of \nal-Qaeda,\u0014\nincluding those that called for violence against Muslim rulers who \ncontradicted\u0014\nIslam--a basic Takfiri tenet. French terrorism expert Jacquard \ndescribes Takfiri\u0014\nindoctrination this way: \"Takfir is like a sect: once you're in, you \nnever get out.\u0014\nThe Takfir rely on brainwashing and an extreme regime of discipline \nto weed\u0014\nout the weak links and ensure loyalty and obedience from those taken \nas\u0014\nmembers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe results of the boot camps are die-hard but undetectable soldiers \nof the\u0014\nmovement. \"The Takfir,\" says Jacquard, \"are the hard core of the hard \ncore:\u0014\nthey are the ones who will be called upon to organize and execute the \nreally big\u0014\nattacks.\" French officials think that Takfiri beliefs have bred a \ndistinct form of\u0014\nterrorism. \"The goal of Takfir,\" says one, \"is to blend into corrupt \nsocieties in\u0014\norder to plot attacks against them better. Members live together, \nwill drink\u0014\nalcohol, eat during Ramadan, become smart dressers and ladies' men to \nshow\u0014\njust how integrated they are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor law-enforcement officials, the Takfiri connection is terrible \nnews. By\u0014\nassimilating into host societies--some won't even worship with other\u0014\nMuslims--it's easy for Takfiris to escape detection. Those stories of \nthe Sept.\u0014\n11 hijackers drinking in bars and carousing in Las Vegas may now have \nan\u0014\nexplanation. Jarrah's cousin Salim, who lives in the German town of \nGreifswald,\u0014\nclaims that they \"used to go to church more than to the mosque.\" \nJarrah, says\u0014\nSalim, loved discos--\"We didn't need veiled women and all that\"--and \nsneaked\u0014\nshots of whiskey during a family wedding. He makes Jarrah sound like \na normal\u0014\nguy, and normal guys aren't easy to catch.\u0014\n\u0014\nBolting the Door\u0014\nThose charged with catching terrorists won't stop trying. And \ngovernments are\u0014\nreassessing their policies on immigration, asylum and open borders. \nNew\u0014\nlegislation is promised in Canada, Britain and Germany; the talks \nthis year\u0014\nwhen Mexican and American officials seriously considered not \ntightening, but\u0014\nliberalizing, their immigration policies now bear the sad echo of a \nlost world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American refugee program, which had been responsible for bringing \nabout\u0014\n80,000 people into the U.S., is barely alive; President Bush hasn't \nsigned its\u0014\nannual authorization. Last week Bush announced further measures to \nbolt the\u0014\nnation's door, including the formation of a Foreign Terrorist \nTracking Task\u0014\nForce to coordinate federal efforts to keep terrorists out and hunt \nthem down if\u0014\nthey slip in. Authorities will now check to see that those who enter \nthe U.S. on\u0014\nstudent visas actually attend school. But there is an air of \ndesperation to the\u0014\nproposals. \"This was not an immigration failure; it was an \nintelligence failure,\"\u0014\nsays Charles Keely, professor of international migration at Georgetown\u0014\nUniversity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Washington, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is regarded \nas a\u0014\nmess; even its spokesman, Russ Bergeron, says it has \"languished for\u0014\ndecades.\" In 1996 Congress told the INS to set up a computer system \nto track\u0014\nthose who come into the U.S. on student visas; but with some 600,000 \nsuch\u0014\npeople in a country with more than 22,000 educational institutions, \nthe system\u0014\nis not yet up and running. Only one of the 19 hijackers entered on a \nstudent\u0014\nvisa. Can screenings in foreign countries be tightened? Maybe, but \nall 19 were\u0014\nrun through a computerized \"watch list\" of suspected terrorists when \nthey\u0014\napplied for visas (at least six were interviewed personally). Nothing \nturned up.\u0014\nIn any event, as Kathleen Newland, co-director of the Migration \nPolicy Institute\u0014\nin Washington, says, \"The facts remain the same.\" Globalization will \ncontinue to\u0014\nspin people around the world. The U.S. will continue to have two \nenormous land\u0014\nborders with peaceful neighbors; we're never going to see watch \ntowers along\u0014\nthe 49th parallel. Each year, says Newland, there are 489 million \nborder\u0014\ncrossings into the U.S., involving 127 million passenger vehicles; \neach year,\u0014\n820,000 planes and 250,000 ships enter U.S. airspace or waters. \nHowever\u0014\nterrorism is beaten, it won't be by American border controls.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill it be by war? In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, there was \na hope that\u0014\npolice work might be able to rid the world of al-Qaeda and its \nassociates. But\u0014\nthe more we know of bin Laden's group, the less that seems likely, \nand not just\u0014\nbecause its operatives are ruthlessly fanatic.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the single most important truth learned in seven weeks is the\u0014\nexistence of a creepy camaraderie, an international bond among \nterrorists.\u0014\nThose ties are forged in Afghanistan. \"The one thing that absolutely \neveryone\u0014\ninvolved in terrorist groups has in common,\" says a European \nofficial, \"is\u0014\npassage through the al-Qaeda camps. When leaders are sent from\u0014\nAfghanistan to start organizing people, there are no questions asked: \nthe camp\u0014\nexperience allows everyone to recognize the bona fides of jihad.\" The \nB-52s\u0014\npounding away from 40,000 ft. may not look like sleuths and cops. But \nif\u0014\nal-Qaeda's sinister appeal and global reach are ever to be broken, the\u0014\nbombers too must play their part. \u0014\n\u0014\nReported by Bruce Crumley/Paris, Helen Gibson and James L. \nGraff/London, Scott MacLeod/Cairo and\u0014\nViveca Novak/Washington, with other bureaus\u0014",

    "title": "HEAVEN INTO HELL",
    "words": "Bob VandePol, MSW, ACSW\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world experienced a taste of hell on September 11 when terrorists \nattacked the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York and the Pentagon in \nWashington, D.C. The ugly, twisted, smoldering wreckage at Ground Bob \nVandePol Zero very closely matched my image of the ultimate evil \nhereafter. From an earthly perspective, hope seemed foolish.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut our Lord asks us to boldly bring light into the world's darkness \nand to follow the Good Samaritan's response to the trauma experienced \nby our neighbors. Jesus' com- mand was \"Go and do likewise\" (Luke \n10:37). AACC's partner in crisis management, Crisis Care Network \n(CCN), was informed about thee tragedies within minutes of their \noccurrence and immediately began mobiliz- ing qualified mental health \nprofessionals to respond. Because AACC had recently begun sponsoring \nCritical Incident Stress Management (CISM) trainings, nearly a dozen \nAACC members joined the clinical team. An Operations Center was \nestablished in New York and the team lodged in a motel convenient to \npublic transportation. A local church volunteered prayer, \ntransportation, and logistical support.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly 100 times a day, team members delivered CISM services to a \nwide variety of employee groups including companies that had fled the \nWorld Trade Center, nearby busi- nesses who had witnessed the event, \nout-locations of WTC businesses, hotel employees where family members \nof the\u0014\nmissing people stayed, those responsible for issuing death \ncertificates, insurance claims adjusters, media reporters, and \nmilitary per- sonnel. Clinical interventions included large group \npsychoeducational presentations, CISM defusings and debriefings, and \nindi- vidual counseling. Those immediately affected presented with \nshock, grief, anxiety, panic, and rage. It was a tremendous privilege \nto offer them opportunities to share images they could share with no \none else on the face of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My office faces the World Trade Center where my husband works. I was \non the phone with him when I saw the plane hit right near his floor.\" \n\"I moved here this year from Russia to be safe.\" \"I was hurrying up \nto the building only to see burning bodies fallout.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Thousands of us were trapped in the Holland Tunnel when a huge cloud \nof smoke and dust began whipping through. We all left our cars still \nrunning and fled for the open- ing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I saw people have to make the choice to stay and burn or to jump.\"\u0014\n\"My office is 36 stories up and 4 blocks away, but the smoke and dust \nwere so dark that I couldn't see the outside of my window sill.\" -\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm Jewish and have seen my grandmother's pictures of the holocaust \nsince I was a child. Ground Zero looks a lot like the holocaust.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I worked in the building that epitomized brazen power and \nsuccess-what it meant to be an American and especially a New Yorker. \nIf the WTC isn't safe, God help us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCritical Incident Stress Debriefings have beeen found to obe \nsuccessful in mitigating the effects of traumatic stress and aiding \nindivid- ual and organizational recovery. A debriefing is a \nstructured group intervention that: assesses the circles of impact to \nassemble like- affected individuals; produces safety through clearly \nunderstood guidelines; offers meas- ured opportunity for \nverbalization of experiences, thoughts, and feelings; identifies and \nnormalizes predictable symptoms; pro- vides stress management \npsychoeducation; and sets an expectation for recovery by strategizing \ninitial return-to-life plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nClinical assessment of need for ongoing treatment is an important \ncomponent of this immediate response. Initially used in public safety \nand the military, it is now the standard of care for trauma response \nin business and industry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether officially providing management consults for the world's most \npowerful Wall Street financial institutions or unofficially \nsupporting cabbies and street vendors, involved AACC members have \nanswered God's call to bring light into darkness and, like the Good \nSamaritan, they served in situa- tions others avoided. They have \nbrought heaven into hell.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO MAKE AND USE AN ADVENT WREATH",
    "words": "How to make and use an \nAdvent wreath\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther had a number of ideas for things that people could do \nat home to teach the catechism to their children. I\u0014\ndont know if he invented the Advent wreath, but it is true that the \nAdvent wreath started in Germany as a Lutheran\u0014\nfamily custom. Since they were originally used in the home, most of \nthe ones you find for sale are small. They didnt\u0014\nbecome popular in churches until the middle of the twentieth century. \nNow they are nearly universal.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can make an Advent wreath with either four or five candles.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to Make an Advent Wreath\u0014\n\u0014\nTo begin, put four candles on a wreath or at least in a circle. \nTraditionally the candles are purple, because in\u0014\nantiquity, purple dye was very expensive and it was the color of \nroyalty. We use purple for Advent because it is the\u0014\nseason of the coming of the King. If you cant get purple candles, \nyou can substitute blue ones. You can also make\u0014\none of the candles pink if you liketechnically, it is rose colored. \nIf you have a fifth candle, it goes in the center of the\u0014\nwreath and it should be white.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf youre curious about the use of color in worship, you can read \nmore about colors.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are the five candles and their symbolism:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst Candle \u0014\n     Color: Purple\u0014\n     Theme: Hope\u0014\n     First Sunday in Advent \u0014\nSecond Candle \u0014\n     Color: Purple\u0014\n     Theme: Love\u0014\n     Second Sunday in Advent \u0014\nThird Candle \u0014\n     Color: Purple or pink\u0014\n     Theme: Joy\u0014\n     Third Sunday in Advent \u0014\nFourth Candle \u0014\n     Color: Purple\u0014\n     Theme: Peace\u0014\n     Fourth Sunday in Advent \u0014\nOptional Center Candle \u0014\n     Color: White\u0014\n     Theme: Christmas\u0014\n     Christmas Day \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the Advent Wreath Means\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorically, the candles have no more meaning than a countdown. That \nis, they originally stood for 4, 3, 2, and 1.\u0014\nHowever, people like for things in the church to have symbolic \nmeanings, so the candles have gradually acquired the\u0014\nmeanings I gave you above. If someone in your church tells you that \nthe candles have some other meaning than\u0014\nHope, Love, Joy, or Peace, they arent wrong, they are just \ndifferent. The meanings are so new that they arent\u0014\ncompletely standardized.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some locations, the third candle is pink, in others the fourth \ncandle is pink; in still others, all four candles are purple.\u0014\nThe purple candles are lit during Advent, when the liturgical color \nis purple, and the white candle is lit on Christmas\u0014\nEve (that is, after sundown), when the liturgical color is white. So \nthat explains the colors of the purple and white\u0014\ncandlesthey just match the liturgical decor. But what about the pink \ncandle, if there is one?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pink candle is becoming more and more popular, but it has a \nstrange origin. Long ago, the pope had the custom\u0014\nof giving someone a rose on the fourth Sunday in Lent. This led the \nRoman Catholic clergy to wear rose-colored\u0014\nvestments on that Sunday. The effect was to give some relief the the \nsolemnity of Lent, so this was a very popular\u0014\ncustom. Originallybefore shopping mallsAdvent was a solemn fast in \npreparation for Christmas, so the custom\u0014\nwas extended to the third Sunday in Advent to liven it up a little \nbit, too. Somewhere in there the third color of the\u0014\nAdvent wreath turned pink. Meanwhile, Advent is no longer solemn and \nthe pope no longer has the custom of giving\u0014\nout roses. It is kind of odd to think that a Methodist would put a \npink candle in a Lutheran Advent wreath because the\u0014\npope used to have the custom of giving out roses, but sometimes were \na little more ecumenical than we realize!\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember, if 24 December is a Sunday, it is the Fourth Sunday in \nAdvent until sundown, at which time it becomes\u0014\nChristmas Eve. (Eve means evening, after all!)\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to Use Your Advent Wreath\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is to use the wreath in conjunction with worship services or \npersonal or family devotions on the four Sundays\u0014\nin Advent. You light candles at the beginning of each service and \nblow them out at the end.\u0014\n\u0014\n     On the first Sunday in Advent, you light the first candle. Have \nyour service, then blow out the candle. \u0014\n     On the second Sunday in Advent, you light two candles, first the \none from the previous Sunday, then the\u0014\n     second one.  Have your service, then blow out the candles. \u0014\n     On the third Sunday in Advent, you light the two candles from \nthe previous weeks, in the order you lit them\u0014\n     before, then you add the third one. Have your service, then blow \nout the candles. \u0014\n     On the fourth Sunday in Advent, you light the three candles from \nthe previous weeks, in the order you lit them\u0014\n     before, then you light the fourth one. Have your service, then \nblow out the candles. You should get a stair-step\u0014\n     effect, since each candle is a different length by now. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you have a fifth candle in the center, then on Christmas Day you \nlight the four candles in the order you lit them\u0014\nbefore, and then you light the center candle. Have your service, then \nblow out the candles.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou notice how I emphasize blowing out the candles at the end of each \nservice? This has absolutely no liturgical\u0014\nsignificance whatsoever, but it is vitally important and you must not \nleave it out. It prevents the candles from burning\u0014\nyour house down.\u0014",

    "words": "His Magical, Mystical Tour\u0014\n                                      By Robert Sullivan\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      He was the quiet Beatle only in \nthat he was standing alongside two\u0014\n                                      louder-than-life characters and \nin front of a guy playing drums. He held\u0014\n                                      many strong opinions--on \nBeatlemania, on global want, on his right to\u0014\n                                      privacy, on his God--and gave \nfirm voice to most of them. But George\u0014\n                                      Harrison was certainly the most \nreluctant Beatle, wanting out almost as\u0014\n                                      soon as he was in. He often \nsaid that his luckiest break was joining the\u0014\n                                      band and his second luckiest \nwas leaving it. And he said once, \"Being a\u0014\n                                      Beatle was a nightmare, a \nhorror story. I don't even like to think about\u0014\n                                      it.\" He never really looked \ncomfortable in his tight suit and\u0014\n                                      pudding-basin haircut, not even \nin the fun-fest A Hard Day's Night, and\u0014\n                                      in this he was perhaps the most \nhonest Beatle, the one least\u0014\n                                      convincing when wearing the \nmask. The standard line is that George\u0014\n                                      Harrison was an enigma, but \nperhaps he was transparent: a terrific\u0014\n                                      guitarist, a fine songwriter, a \nwonderer, a seeker and, overriding all, a\u0014\n                                      celebrity who hated and feared \ncelebrity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Harrison died at a friend's \nhome in Los Angeles last week at age 58,\u0014\n                                      losing his last battle with \ncancer. In 1997 he had a cancerous lump\u0014\n                                      removed from his neck; earlier \nthis year he was operated on for a\u0014\n                                      cancer found on his lung and \nsubsequently received treatment for a\u0014\n                                      tumor on his brain, including a \ncontroversial form of radiation therapy at\u0014\n                                      the Staten Island University \nHospital in New York City. \"George is very\u0014\n                                      different from many people in \nthat he didn't have fear of death,\" said Gil\u0014\n                                      Lederman, one of his doctors \nthere. \"He felt that life and death were\u0014\n                                      part of the same process.\" \nHarrison's passing leaves only Paul\u0014\n                                      McCartney and Ringo Starr as \nsurviving members of the Fab\u0014\n                                      Four--John Lennon was murdered \nin New York City in 1980. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Harrison's wife Olivia and son \nDhani, 23, were at his bedside when he\u0014\n                                      died, and as word spread about \nhis death, Harrison was mourned and\u0014\n                                      eulogized by the crowds who \ngathered outside the Abbey Road studios\u0014\n                                      in London and in Strawberry \nFields, the area of Manhattan's Central\u0014\n                                      Park across from where Lennon \nwas shot, and by his former\u0014\n                                      bandmates. \"He was a beautiful \nman. He was like my baby brother to\u0014\n                                      me,\" said Sir Paul, who lost \nhis wife Linda to breast cancer in 1998.\u0014\n                                      Starr, long Harrison's best \nfriend in the band, said, \"We will miss\u0014\n                                      George for his sense of love, \nhis sense of music and his sense of\u0014\n                                      laughter.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      That hosannas from the \nbeknighted would be sung for George\u0014\n                                      Harrison, born the son of a \nLiverpool bus driver during the darkest\u0014\n                                      days of World War II, is in \nkeeping with the kind of miracles the Beatles\u0014\n                                      made for themselves. The most \nfamous of the Beatles' fated hookups\u0014\n                                      involves McCartney wandering by \na summer festival at St. Peter's\u0014\n                                      Parish Church in Liverpool's \nWoolton district on a hot day in 1957, and\u0014\n                                      being transfixed by a skiffle \nband called the Quarry Men. Paul\u0014\n                                      happened to have brought his \nguitar and impressed the band's leader,\u0014\n                                      a cocky lad named Lennon, with \nraucous renderings of Eddie Cochran\u0014\n                                      and Little Richard songs. \nThat's the big cosmic moment, but in official\u0014\n                                      Beatles lore there's an even \nearlier bit of predestiny. It is 1955, and\u0014\n                                      George Harrison, just 12, is a \nmiserable student putting in an hour's\u0014\n                                      commute on his dad's bus, \ntraveling from the family home in Speke to\u0014\n                                      the Liverpool Institute. He is \nengaged in conversation by a boy a year\u0014\n                                      ahead of him in school, the son \nof a cotton salesman from Allerton.\u0014\n                                      Paul McCartney is just as crazy \nabout guitars and American rockabilly\u0014\n                                      stars as is Harrison, and soon \nhe is joining young George in the\u0014\n                                      evenings to practice their \ndistinctive versions of Don't You Rock Me\u0014\n                                      Daddy-O and Besame Mucho. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Without rehashing the many \npermutations of the evolving Quarry Men\u0014\n                                      of the late '50s--the Moondogs, \nthe Silver Beatles, the endless series of\u0014\n                                      exploding drummers--we arrive \nin the Reeperbahn, the famous cabaret\u0014\n                                      district in Hamburg, Germany, \nin the early 1960s with a band whose\u0014\n                                      front line is \nLennon-McCartney-Harrison because Lennon, in his\u0014\n                                      wisdom, had decided that he \nwould put at risk his dominance to build\u0014\n                                      the strongest group. The way to \nthink of those early Beatles is as one\u0014\n                                      of the grittiest, nastiest, \nbest punk bands ever, getting tighter by the\u0014\n                                      night during sets that might \nlast eight hours. \"We were frothing at the\u0014\n                                      mouth,\" Harrison remembered in \nThe Beatles Anthology, a scrapbook\u0014\n                                      of photos and reminiscences \npublished last year, \"because we had all\u0014\n                                      these hours to play and the \nclub owners were giving us Preludins,\u0014\n                                      which were slimming tablets. I \ndon't think they were amphetamine, but\u0014\n                                      they were uppers. So we used to \nbe up there foaming, stomping away.\"\u0014\n                                      On many occasions he said that \nthe best Beatles shows were in the\u0014\n                                      clubs of Hamburg.\u0014\n                                      Harrison was the baby of the \nband, and if the inner dynamic of the\u0014\n                                      Beatles had been different, his \nage might have cost him his place in\u0014\n                                      history. During the group's \nfirst five-month gig in Germany, authorities\u0014\n                                      discovered that Harrison, at \n17, was too young to be working in the\u0014\n                                      Reeperbahn nightclubs. They had \nhim deported. Guitarists can be\u0014\n                                      replaced, but by then McCartney \nand Lennon were protective of their\u0014\n                                      little brother--the Beatles \nwere as much a fiercely insular family as they\u0014\n                                      were a ferocious rock band--and \na few weeks later the boys were\u0014\n                                      playing together again in \nEngland. Sounding better than ever, and\u0014\n                                      much better than other \nLiverpool pop bands, the Beatles became local\u0014\n                                      legends through their shows at \nthe Cavern Club. They got a record\u0014\n                                      contract, replaced their \ndrummer with the talented Starr and were on\u0014\n                                      their way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      For Harrison, much more quickly \nthan for the others, the magic of the\u0014\n                                      moment flickered and died. \"At \nfirst we all thought we wanted the fame\u0014\n                                      and that,\" he said in 1988. \n\"After a bit we realized that fame wasn't\u0014\n                                      really what we were after at \nall, just the fruits of it. After the initial\u0014\n                                      excitement and thrill had worn \noff, I, for one, became depressed. Is this\u0014\n                                      all we have to look forward to \nin life? Being chased around by a crowd\u0014\n                                      of hooting lunatics from one \ncrappy hotel room to the next?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      During the Beatles' grand \nconquest of America in 1964, when their\u0014\n                                      initial appearance on The Ed \nSullivan Show drew an astonishing 73\u0014\n                                      million viewers and made them \nan overnight phenomenon, Harrison\u0014\n                                      spent his days holed up in the \nPlaza Hotel with a high fever while the\u0014\n                                      fab other three paraded around \ntown, wowing the world's press with\u0014\n                                      their vitality and wit. Then it \nwas on to Washington for a concert at the\u0014\n                                      Coliseum before more than 7,000 \nscreaming fans. \"It was bloody awful,\"\u0014\n                                      Harrison told biographer \nGeoffrey Giuliano. \"Some journalist had\u0014\n                                      apparently dug up an old quote \nof John's that I was fond of jelly babies\u0014\n                                      and had written about it in his \ncolumn. That night we were absolutely\u0014\n                                      pelted ... Imagine waves of \nrock-hard little bullets raining down on you\u0014\n                                      from the sky. Every now and \nthen one would hit a string on my guitar\u0014\n                                      and plonk off a bad note as I \nwas trying to play. From then on,\u0014\n                                      everywhere we went it was \nexactly the same.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Harrison's guitar idols had \nincluded not only rocker Carl Perkins but\u0014\n                                      also Andres Segovia, and he had \nworked hard to master an intricate,\u0014\n                                      precise technique (his later \nexperiments with 12-string guitars, not to\u0014\n                                      mention his sitar playing, \nwould be vastly influential in rock music). Now\u0014\n                                      concertgoers couldn't even hear \nhim, and, worse, they didn't care.\u0014\n                                      Harrison, who turned 21 just \nafter that first brief American tour,\u0014\n                                      wondered to the others on the \nflight home, \"How f______ stupid it all is.\u0014\n                                      All that big hassle to make it, \nonly to end up as performing fleas.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      It wasn't long before the other \nBeatles shared that opinion, and the\u0014\n                                      band's last public concert was \nat San Francisco's Candlestick Park on\u0014\n                                      Aug. 29, 1966. (The city had \nwanted to give the group a ticker-tape\u0014\n                                      parade, but the boys nixed the \nidea. They were terrified by the crush of\u0014\n                                      Beatlemaniacs and thinking not \nonly of John F. Kennedy's\u0014\n                                      assassination but also of death \nthreats the Beatles had received in the\u0014\n                                      wake of Lennon's recent \"We're \nmore popular than Jesus\" comment.)\u0014\n                                      With the end of live \nperformance, the band, and Harrison in particular,\u0014\n                                      moved on to what he considered \nmore serious endeavors. His marriage\u0014\n                                      to Patti Boyd in early '66 had \naltered his perspective, as had what he\u0014\n                                      called \"the dental experience,\" \nwhich, he said, \"made us see life in a\u0014\n                                      different light.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      The dental experience happened \nin 1964. Hamburg club managers had\u0014\n                                      introduced the Beatles to \nuppers, and Bob Dylan had turned them on\u0014\n                                      to marijuana. Now, at a dinner \nparty at George's dentist's house in\u0014\n                                      London, the host slipped sugar \ncubes laced with lsd into the\u0014\n                                      after-dinner coffee of George \nand Patti, John and his wife Cynthia.\u0014\n                                      Within months, all the Beatles \nwere experimenting with acid, and\u0014\n                                      eventually Paul was into \ncocaine, John into heroin and George a fan of\u0014\n                                      hashish (for which he would be \nbusted in March 1969). The music they\u0014\n                                      continued to make in the studio \nchanged. It got denser, trippier. The\u0014\n                                      single Strawberry Fields was \nfollowed by the seminal album Sgt.\u0014\n                                      Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club \nBand, and the Beatles led their\u0014\n                                      generation into a psychedelic \nworld. As Harrison began to emerge as a\u0014\n                                      songwriter, his exquisitely \narranged compositions--Within You, Without\u0014\n                                      You; Love You Too; Blue Jay \nWay--were informed not only by drug use\u0014\n                                      but, in their melody and \nmessage, also by his increasing interest in\u0014\n                                      Eastern religion, culture and \nmusic. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      He came by this interest, which \nwould become the driving force in his\u0014\n                                      life, when the script of the \nsecond Beatles film, Help!, called for chase\u0014\n                                      scenes involving cartoonish \nHindu villains, and Indian sitar players were\u0014\n                                      brought in to provide some \nzippy chase music. George started noodling\u0014\n                                      on a sitar--if indeed one can \nnoodle on a sitar--and asking questions.\u0014\n                                      This led to exotic \ninstrumentation on the Lennon ballad Norwegian\u0014\n                                      Wood (This Bird Has Flown) and \nlater to an apprenticeship with master\u0014\n                                      sitarist Ravi Shankar, who gave \nHarrison lessons on the instrument and\u0014\n                                      in life itself. \"He was a \nfriend, a disciple and son to me,\" said Shankar,\u0014\n                                      who visited Harrison for the \nlast time on Wednesday. \"George was a\u0014\n                                      brave and beautiful soul, full \nof love, childlike humor and a deep\u0014\n                                      spirituality. We spent the day \nbefore with him, and even then he looked\u0014\n                                      so peaceful, surrounded by \nlove.\"\u0014\n                                      The Beatles' famous trip to \nIndia in 1968, where they meditated under\u0014\n                                      the guidance of the Maharishi \nMahesh Yogi, was largely Harrison's\u0014\n                                      show. He and Patti had become \ndevotees of the religious leader and\u0014\n                                      arranged for the band to spend \ntime at the maharishi's ashram in the\u0014\n                                      Himalayan foothills. Other \ncelebrities--Mia Farrow, the singer Donovan,\u0014\n                                      Mike Love of the Beach \nBoys--went on retreat as well, and the episode\u0014\n                                      is remembered as one of the \npivotal, if oddest, events of the Flower\u0014\n                                      Power '60s. Indisputably \nbeautiful fruits of the getaway were the songs\u0014\n                                      composed there. John said he \nwrote \"hundreds\"; Paul came up with at\u0014\n                                      least 15; and most of the \nBeatles' White Album and Abbey Road were\u0014\n                                      conceived in Rishikesh. George \ncontributed four songs, including the\u0014\n                                      anticarnivore screed Piggies \nand the gorgeous Here Comes the Sun\u0014\n                                      and Something. With more than \n150 versions recorded, Something is\u0014\n                                      the second-most-covered Beatles \nsong after Yesterday, but a measure\u0014\n                                      of Harrison's obscurity within \nthe band is that Frank Sinatra used to\u0014\n                                      introduce Something as his \nfavorite Lennon-McCartney tune. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Such confusion would end with \nthe band's acrimonious breakup,\u0014\n                                      announced in 1970. For \nHarrison, the split opened the door to artistic\u0014\n                                      liberation. He had been piling \nup songs for months--years--songs that\u0014\n                                      couldn't be squeezed onto \nBeatles albums, brimful as they were with\u0014\n                                      Lennon and McCartney's efforts. \nNow, in a work that is the very\u0014\n                                      definition of magnum opus, \nHarrison poured forth the three-disc set All\u0014\n                                      Things Must Pass. (A \n30th-anniversary reissue earlier this year only\u0014\n                                      confirmed that this was \nHarrison's masterpiece. ) \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      The bulky boxed set went to No. \n1 in 1971, propelled by such hits as\u0014\n                                      My Sweet Lord and What Is Life. \nHarrison had found a new spiritual\u0014\n                                      mentor, Srila Prabhupada of the \nInternational Society for Krishna\u0014\n                                      Consciousness, and Hindu \nsentiments and sounds permeate the\u0014\n                                      record, further spurring sitar \nsales and causing many listeners to\u0014\n                                      investigate Eastern religions. \nIn the early aftermath of the Beatles\u0014\n                                      demise, Harrison, the \nrevelation, rivaled Lennon or McCartney as a pop\u0014\n                                      icon, and Shankar realized his \nfriend might be the perfect front man for\u0014\n                                      a good cause. In August 1971, \nHarrison and friends Dylan, Starr, Leon\u0014\n                                      Russell and Eric Clapton staged \ntwo concerts at New York City's\u0014\n                                      Madison Square Garden to raise \nmoney for the flood- and\u0014\n                                      famine-ravaged Indian \nsubcontinent. The Concert for Bangladesh\u0014\n                                      established Harrison as a \npioneering rock philanthropist, and set a\u0014\n                                      model for future celebrity \nfund-raising efforts like Live Aid, the We Are\u0014\n                                      the World record and the \nConcert for New York City, starring\u0014\n                                      McCartney, at Madison Square \nGarden six weeks ago for victims of the\u0014\n                                      World Trade Center attacks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      With George now front and \ncenter, his fans got to know him better. It\u0014\n                                      became evident that the quiet \nBeatle was, in fact, possessed of the\u0014\n                                      same dry, sarcastic, \nLiverpudlian wit that Lennon was known for.\u0014\n                                      (During the Beatles' recording \nsession with producer George Martin\u0014\n                                      back in 1962, he asked them, \n\"Is there anything you're not happy\u0014\n                                      about?\" It was George, not \nJohn, after all, who famously answered,\u0014\n                                      \"Well, there's your tie, for \nstarters.\") Harrison, with individual success,\u0014\n                                      seemed more at ease, and his \ngeniality throughout the 1970s saw his\u0014\n                                      image evolve to that of the \nhappy mystic. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Clapton, along with Dylan, \nbecame one of Harrison's best friends, and\u0014\n                                      it's rather astonishing that \nthis friendship was not destroyed when Patti\u0014\n                                      became Mrs. Clapton in 1979, \ntwo years after she and George\u0014\n                                      divorced and a year after \nGeorge married the American Olivia Arias. By\u0014\n                                      the late 1970s Harrison was as \nmuch entrepreneur as musician. He had\u0014\n                                      started his own record label \n(Dark Horse, in 1974) and his own\u0014\n                                      movie-production company, \nHandMade Films, which he set up to help\u0014\n                                      his pal Eric Idle finish his \nMonty Python film Life of Brian. Other\u0014\n                                      HandMade productions included \nthe 1981 fantasy Time Bandits and\u0014\n                                      the 1986 noirish drama Mona \nLisa, which launched actor Bob Hoskins.\u0014\n                                      Harrison's cinema dabblings \nalso included a cameo in Idle's faux\u0014\n                                      rockumentary All You Need Is \nCash, about the Rutles--the \"Prefab\u0014\n                                      Four.\" According to George, the \nparody told the Beatles story \"much\u0014\n                                      better than the usual boring \ndocumentary.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Scared into near reclusion by \nMark David Chapman's killing of Lennon\u0014\n                                      in December 1980, Harrison \nspent most of his time meditating, music\u0014\n                                      making, gardening and watching \nFormula One races on the telly at\u0014\n                                      Friar Park, his extraordinary \nestate in Henley-on-Thames, and at his\u0014\n                                      hideaway on the Hawaiian island \nof Maui. He ventured out occasionally\u0014\n                                      to record and play with the \nTraveling Wilburys, a supergroup that\u0014\n                                      included Dylan, Tom Petty and \nothers. But various legal battles took up\u0014\n                                      even more of his time. In 1976 \nhe had to pay $587,000 for\u0014\n                                      \"subconsciously plagiarizing\" \nthe old Chiffons hit He's So Fine in his\u0014\n                                      melody for My Sweet Lord. In \n1991, he brought a seven-figure\u0014\n                                      defamation-of-character suit \nwhen the tabloid the Globe published a\u0014\n                                      story calling him a \"Big Nazi \nFan.\" And in 1996 he won an $11.6 million\u0014\n                                      judgment against his former \nbusiness partner in HandMade films, Denis\u0014\n                                      O'Brien, for not assuming his \nagreed-upon share of the company's\u0014\n                                      debt. That same year Harrison \nasked authorities to investigate a series\u0014\n                                      of death threats. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      None of those threats were \nproved to have come from Michael Abram,\u0014\n                                      but it was Abram, a 33-year-old \nBeatle obsessive from a Liverpool\u0014\n                                      suburb, who, in the dead of \nnight on Dec. 30, 1999, got past the alarms\u0014\n                                      and razor wire at Friar Park \nand broke into the Harrisons' mansion.\u0014\n                                      George suffered an inch-deep \nstab wound to his chest before Olivia\u0014\n                                      knocked Abram down with a \nbedside lamp. Harrison recovered, and\u0014\n                                      Abram was sent to a mental \ninstitution. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      While Harrison was able to \nsurvive the pressures of being a Beatle and\u0014\n                                      an assault by a maniac, he \ncouldn't beat cancer. But he made the\u0014\n                                      passage to death easier for \nhimself by believing so passionately for so\u0014\n                                      long in a life after this one. \nSaid his old friend Mia Farrow last week:\u0014\n                                      \"One of the things that was so \ninspiring was his lifelong search to know\u0014\n                                      his God. And if God exists, I \ndon't doubt that George has a place near\u0014\n                                      him. \" If she's right, Harrison \nis happy. He may have been scared of the\u0014\n                                      adoring crowds, but he was not \nafraid to let go.\u0014",

His \nprofessors had confidently said that Luke could not be right.\u0014\n\tHe began to dig in the ancient ruins of Greece and Asia Minor, \ntesting for ancient terms, boundaries, and other items which would be \na dead giveaway if a writer had been inventing this history at a \nlater date as claimed. To his amazement, he found that the New \nTestament Scriptures were accurate to the tiniest detail. So \nconvincing was the evidence that Ramsay himself became a Christian \nand a great biblical scholar. We still look upon Sir William Ramsay's \nbooks as being a classic as far as the history of the New Testament \nis concerned.\u0014\nScience Returns to God\u0014",

The Middle \nEast today stands\u0014\n                        in stark contrast to the rest of the world, \nwhere freedom\u0014\n                        and democracy have been gaining ground over \nthe last\u0014\n                        two decades. In its latest annual survey, \nreleased last\u0014\n                        week, New Yorks Freedom House finds that 75 \npercent of\u0014\n                        the worlds countries are currently free or \npartly free.\u0014\n                        Only 28 percent of Middle Eastern countries \ncould be so\u0014\n                        described, a percentage that has fallen \nduring the last 20\u0014\n                        years. By comparison, more than 60 percent of \nAfrican\u0014\n                        countries today are free or partly free.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                The initial reasons for this \nhands-off approach to the\u0014\n                        Middle East were oil, then Israel. The United \nStates is\u0014\n                        terrified by the prospect of chaos in the \npetroleum\u0014\n                        paradise of Arabia. It has also assumed that \ndictators\u0014\n                        could guarantee a more secure peace with \nIsrael than\u0014\n                        democrats. But now, above all, Washington \nsimply worries\u0014\n                        about changeFOTA. The monarchs and dictators \nare\u0014\n                        quick to remind us always that for all their \nfaults, they are\u0014\n                        better than the alternative.\u0014\n                                The worst part of it is, they may be \nright. Americas\u0014\n                        allies in the Middle East are autocratic, \ncorrupt and\u0014\n                        heavy-handed. But they are still more \nliberal, tolerant and\u0014\n                        pluralistic than what would likely replace \nthem. If elections\u0014\n                        had been held last month in Saudi Arabia with \nKing Fahd\u0014\n                        and Osama bin Laden on the ballot, I would \nnot bet too\u0014\n                        heavily on His Royal Highnesss fortunes. \nLast year the\u0014\n                        emir of Kuwait, with American encouragement, \nproposed to\u0014\n                        give women the vote. But the democratically \nelected\u0014\n                        Parliamentpacked with Islamic \nfundamentalistsroundly\u0014\n                        rejected the initiative. A similar dynamic is \nevident in the\u0014\n                        kingdoms of the gulf from Saudi Arabia to \nBahrain. In\u0014\n                        Jordan and Morocco, on virtually every \npolitical issue, the\u0014\n                        monarchs are more liberal than the societies \nover which\u0014\n                        they reign. In the Palestinian Authority, \nHamas has more\u0014\n                        popular support than Arafats Palestine \nLiberation\u0014\n                        Organization, especially with the young. And \nmany of\u0014\n                        these Islamic fundamentalist parties are sham \ndemocrats.\u0014\n                        They would happily come to power through an \nelection but\u0014\n                        then set up their own dictatorship. It would \nbe one man,\u0014\n                        one vote, one time.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n\u0014\n                        FANTASY, DENIAL AND DELUSION\u0014\n                               Consider the Arab reaction to the \nvideotape of Osama\u0014\n                        bin Laden. Most of the regions governments \nquickly noted\u0014\n                        that the tape seemed genuine and proved bin \nLadens\u0014\n                        guilt. Prince Bandar issued a statement that \nsaid, The\u0014\n                        tape displays the cruel and inhumane face of \na murderous\u0014\n                        criminal who has no respect for the sanctity \nof human life\u0014\n                        or the principles of his faith. Compare \nthose reactions with\u0014\n                        that of a Saudi cleric like Sheik Mohammad \nSaleh, a\u0014\n                        dissident voice, who said, I think this \nrecording is forged.\u0014\n                        Or Abdul Latif Arabiat, head of Jordans \nmainstream\u0014\n                        Islamist party, the Islamic Action Front, who \nexplained, Do\u0014\n                        the Americans really think the world is that \nstupid to think\u0014\n                        that they would believe that this tape is \nevidence? In most\u0014\n                        societies dissidents force their country to \ntake a hard look\u0014\n                        at its own failings. In the Middle East, the \ndemocrats are\u0014\n                        the first to seek refuge in fantasy, denial \nand delusion.\u0014\n                        The state-owned media do not need to promote \ncrazed\u0014\n                        conspiracy theories about the Mossads secret \nrole in\u0014\n                        bombing the World Trade Center or the CIAs \nfabrication\u0014\n                        of the bin Laden videotape.

Caught between autocratic states and \nilliberal\u0014\n                        societies, the temptation is to throw up \nones hands in\u0014\n                        despair and walk away. Indeed, many \nthoughtful observers\u0014\n                        have done so, arguing that our task should \nsimply be to\u0014\n                        crush Al Qaeda and groups like it. This might \nforce Arabs\u0014\n                        to look at their own societies and ask some \nhard\u0014\n                        questions. But that is their concern.\u0014\n                                Military victory is indeed essential. \nRadical political\u0014\n                        Islam is an armed doctrine, in Edmund \nBurkes phrase.\u0014\n                        Like other armed doctrines before itfascism, \nfor\u0014\n                        exampleit can be discredited only by first \nbeing\u0014\n                        defeated. When Adolf Hitler was on the rise \nand advancing\u0014\n                        in the 1930s, tens of millions of people in \nEurope and\u0014\n                        around the world admired his strength and \nvision. (Young\u0014\n                        children from Latin America to Turkey were \nnamed Adolf in\u0014\n                        his honor.) Once Nazism was destroyed, they \nquickly\u0014\n                        abandoned his cause. (The children were given \nnew\u0014\n                        names.) Bin Laden understands well the power \nof success.\u0014\n                        On the videotape, speaking of the surge of \ninterest in his\u0014\n                        cause after September 11, he says \nmatter-of-factly, When\u0014\n                        people see a strong horse and a weak horse, \nby nature\u0014\n                        they will like the strong horse. America \nmust ensure that\u0014\n                        men like bin Laden are always seen as weak \nhorses,\u0014\n                        preferably dead ones.\u0014\n                              \u0014\n                        AN UNSTABLE QUEST FOR STABILITY\u0014\n                               Having destroyed bin Ladens aura of \nsuccess, the\u0014\n                        United States now has a unique opportunity to \npress its\u0014\n                        victory and drain the swamp of Islamic \nextremism. This\u0014\n                        means taking the battle to its real source, \nwhich is not\u0014\n                        Afghanistan but Arabia. Washington cannot \nwalk away\u0014\n                        from that region. Oil, strategic ties and \nhistory will ensure\u0014\n                        our ongoing involvement. We will continue to \naid the\u0014\n                        Egyptian regime, we will continue to protect \nthe Saudi\u0014\n                        monarchy, we will continue to broker \nnegotiations between\u0014\n                        Israel and the Palestinians. The question \nreally is,\u0014\n                        shouldnt we ask for something in return? By \nnot pushing\u0014\n                        these regimes, the United States would be \nmaking a\u0014\n                        conscious decision to let things stay as they \nareto once\u0014\n                        again opt for stability. But it is \nblindingly clear that the\u0014\n                        current situation is highly unstable. Even if \nviewed from a\u0014\n                        narrow strategic perspective, it is in \nAmericas immediate\u0014\n                        security interests to try to make the regimes \nof the Middle\u0014\n                        East less prone to breed fanaticism and \nterror. And the\u0014\n                        only way to do this is to make these regimes \nmore\u0014\n                        legitimate in the eyes of their people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        At the start the United States must recognize \nits true\u0014\n                        goals. We do not seek democracy in the Middle \nEastat\u0014\n                        least not yet. We seek first what might be \ncalled the\u0014\n                        preconditions for democracy, or what I have \ncalled\u0014\n                        constitutional liberalismthe rule of law, \nindividual rights,\u0014\n                        private property, independent courts, the \nseparation of\u0014\n                        church and state. In the Western world these \ntwo ideas\u0014\n                        have fused togetherhence liberal \ndemocracybut they\u0014\n                        are analytically and historically distinct. \nBritain and the\u0014\n                        United States were both countries governed by \nlaw and in\u0014\n                        which human rights were honored well before \nthey became\u0014\n                        full-fledged electoral democracies. We should \nnot assume\u0014\n                        that what took hundreds of years in the West \ncan happen\u0014\n                        overnight in the Middle East.\u0014\n                                Clarifying our immediate goals \nactually makes them\u0014\n                        more easily attainable. The regimes in the \nMiddle East will\u0014\n                        be delighted to learn that we will not try to \nforce them to\u0014\n                        hold elections tomorrow. They will be less \npleased to know\u0014\n                        that we will continually press them on a \nwhole array of\u0014\n                        other issues. The starting point for talking \nto our allies\u0014\n                        should be that they observe the Hippocratic \ncounseldo\u0014\n                        no harm. The Saudi monarchy must order a\u0014\n                        comprehensive overview of its funding (both \nprivate and\u0014\n                        public) of extremist Islam, which is now the \nkingdoms\u0014\n                        second largest export to the rest of the \nworld. It must rein\u0014\n                        in its religious and educational leaders and \nforce them to\u0014\n                        stop flirting with fanaticism. In Egypt, we \nmust ask\u0014\n                        President Mubarak to insist that the \nstate-owned press\u0014\n                        drop its anti-American and anti-Semitic \nrants, end the\u0014\n                        glorification of suicide bombers and begin \nopening itself up\u0014\n                        to other voices in the country. In Qatar we \nmight ask the\u0014\n                        emir, who launched Al-Jazeera, to make sure \nthat\u0014\n                        responsible, moderate Muslims appear as \nregularly on his\u0014\n                        network as extremist bin Laden sympathizers. \nNone of this\u0014\n                        will produce democracy, but it will slow down \nthe spread of\u0014\n                        illiberal voices and viewpoints. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                         \u0014\n                        THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY\u0014\n                                                   \u0014\n                       These are all important steps, but they are \ntemporary ones, attempts to pour water on\u0014\n                       a fiery culture. The more lasting path to \nreform will be economic. Over the last three \u0014\n                       decades there has been a remarkable pattern in \nthe progress of  political freedom around\u0014\n                        the world. Those countries that have made the \ntransition\u0014\n                        from dictatorship to democracy with greatest\u0014\n                        successSpain, Portugal, Chile, Taiwan, South \nKorea,\u0014\n                        Mexicoall traveled along a similar road. The \nregimes first\u0014\n                        liberalized the economy, not out of any \ndesire to expand\u0014\n                        freedom but rather because they wanted to get \nrich. But\u0014\n                        this expansion of economic liberty had steady \nspillover\u0014\n                        effects. Economic reform meant the beginnings \nof a\u0014\n                        genuine rule of lawcapitalism needs\u0014\n                        contractsopenness to the world, access to \ninformation\u0014\n                        and, perhaps most important, the development \nof a\u0014\n                        business class. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Karl Marx was wrong about most \nthings. But he was\u0014\n                        right when he argued that an independent \nclass of\u0014\n                        business people is the key to liberal \ndemocracy. (Of\u0014\n                        course, he did not mean this as a \ncompliment.) Business\u0014\n                        people have a stake in openness, in rules and \nin stability.\u0014\n                        They want their societies to modernize and \nmove forward\u0014\n                        rather than stay trapped in factionalism and \nwar. Instead of\u0014\n                        the romance of ideology, they seek the \nreality of material\u0014\n                        progress. In the Middle East today there are \ntoo many\u0014\n                        people consumed by political dreams and too \nfew\u0014\n                        interested in practical plans. There is a \ndominant business\u0014\n                        class there, but it is one that owes its \nposition to oil or\u0014\n                        connections to the ruling families. It is the \nwealth of\u0014\n                        feudalism, not capitalism, and its political \neffects remain\u0014\n                        feudal as well. A genuine entrepreneurial \nbusiness class\u0014\n                        would be the single most important force for \nchange in the\u0014\n                        Middle East, pulling along all others in its \nwake. (The\u0014\n                        Palestinians, tragically, have long been the \nregions best\u0014\n                        merchants and would probably respond fastest \nto new\u0014\n                        economic opportunities if they could put the \nintifada\u0014\n                        behind them.) Ultimately, this battle is one \nMiddle\u0014\n                        Easterners will have to fight, which is why \nthere needs to\u0014\n                        be some group within these societies that \nadvocates and\u0014\n                        benefits from economic and political reform. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 This is not asfantastic an idea as \nit might sound. There are already stirrings of\u0014\n                        genuine economic activity  in parts of the \nMiddle East. Jordan has become a\u0014\n                        member of the WTO, signed a free-trade pact \nwith the United States, privatized key \u0014\n                        industries and even encouraged cross-border \nbusiness  ventures with Israel. Egypt\u0014\n                        has made some small progress on the road to \nreform.  Among the oil-rich \ncountries,                                   Bahrain and the United \nArab Emirates are trying to wean themselves of their\u0014\n                        dependence on oil. Dubai, part of the U.A.E., \nhas already gotten oil down to merely 8   \u0014\n                        percent of its GDP and publicly  announces \nits intention to become the Singapore of the\u0014\n                        Middle East. (It would do well to emulate \nSingapores\u0014\n                        tolerance of its ethnic and religious \nminorities.) Even Saudi\u0014\n                        Arabia recognizes that its oil economy can \nprovide only\u0014\n                        one job for every three of its young men \ncoming into the\u0014\n                        work force. In Algeria, President Abdelaziz \nBouteflika\u0014\n                        desperately wants foreign investment to \nrepair his tattered\u0014\n                        economy. We should welcome this interest. \nEconomic\u0014\n                        necessity can be the mother of reform. But \nWashington\u0014\n                        ought to insist on genuine reformnew legal \ncodes, new\u0014\n                        regulations, privatizationbefore giving any\u0014\n                        encouragement to the IMF or the private \nsector to venture\u0014\n                        into these countries. Better to have two \ncountries that are\u0014\n                        genuine reformers than 20 fraudulent programs.\u0014\n                                If we could choose one place to press \nhardest to\u0014\n                        reform, it should be Egypt. Jordan has a more \nprogressive\u0014\n                        ruler; Saudi Arabia is more critical because \nof its oil. But\u0014\n                        Egypt is the intellectual soul of the Arab \nworld. If it were to\u0014\n                        progress economically and politically, it \nwould demonstrate\u0014\n                        more powerfully than any essay or speech that \nIslam is\u0014\n                        compatible with modernity, and that Arabs can \nthrive in\u0014\n                        todays world. In East Asia, Japans economic \nsuccess\u0014\n                        proved to be a powerful example that others \nin the region\u0014\n                        looked to and followed. The Middle East needs \none such\u0014\n                        homegrown success story. (To its credit, the \nClinton\u0014\n                        administration did try a high-level economic \ninitiative\u0014\n                        toward Egypt along these lines, but the \nEgyptian regime\u0014\n                        was able to stymie it.)\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                        FEAR OF FUNDAMENTALISM\u0014\n                               When we sit down to talk with these \nregimes,\u0014\n                        inevitably we will return to FOTA, Fear of \nthe Alternative.\u0014\n                        The regimes will remind us that they cannot \ndo all that we\u0014\n                        ask because otherwise the fundamentalists \nwill come to\u0014\n                        power. We should not believe them. The rulers \nof the\u0014\n                        Middle East are not democratic politicians \nwith finely tuned\u0014\n                        senses of what their publics want. They are \ndictators. After\u0014\n                        all, if Mubarak were so close to his people, \nwhy would he\u0014\n                        need to arrest, torture and murder hundreds \nto stay in\u0014\n                        power?

Yet Muslim \nfundamentalists\u0014\n                        cannot openly stand for elections to it. This \nhas made\u0014\n                        them only more extreme and heightened their \nstature as\u0014\n                        persecuted heroes.

The mullahs can preach, but they \ncannot rule.\u0014\n                        For this reason, Iran might well hold out the \ngreatest\u0014\n                        promise for liberal democracy and secular \npolitics in the\u0014\n                        Middle East. Having lived under Islamic \nfundamentalist\u0014\n                        rule, Iranians are now inoculated against its \nappeal. It may\u0014\n                        take another decade or two, and risking that \nlongand\u0014\n                        bumpyroller-coaster ride is dangerous for \ncountries like\u0014\n                        Egypt and Saudi Arabia. But if these regimes \nwere to open\u0014\n                        up some political space and force their \nfundamentalist foes\u0014\n                        to grapple with practical realities rather \nthan spin dreams,\u0014\n                        they will find it cannot but dull the \nextremists allure. Islamic\u0014\n                        fundamentalists must stop being seen as \ndistant heroes\u0014\n                        and viewed instead as local politicians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        A consummate politician, Tip ONeill, once \nsaid that all politics is local. So is\u0014\n                        the politics of rage. The frustrations of \nordinary Arabs are not about the\u0014\n                        clash of civilizations or  the rise of \nMcDonalds or the imperial foreign\u0014\n                        policy of the United States. They are a \nresponse to living under wretched,\u0014\n                        repressive regimes with few economic \nopportunities and no  political voice. And they\u0014\n                        blame America for supporting these regimes. \nFor those who think that this problem\u0014\n                        is unique to the Arab world or that Arabs \nwill never\u0014\n                        change, remember that 25 years ago the most \nvirulent\u0014\n                        anti-American protests would have taken place \nin\u0014\n                        countries like Chile, Mexico and South Korea. \nThe reasons\u0014\n                        were the samepeople disliked the regimes \nthat ruled\u0014\n                        them and they saw America as the benefactor \nof those\u0014\n                        regimes. Then these dictatorships \nliberalized, peoples\u0014\n                        lives improved, political reform followed \neconomic reform\u0014\n                        and anti-U.S. sentiment has quieted down to \nthe usual\u0014\n                        protests against the Americanization of their \ncultures. With\u0014\n                        Osama bin Ladens decline, perhaps the Middle \nEast will\u0014\n                        move on a similar path; violence, religious \nextremism and\u0014\n                        terrorism will be drained out of the \npolitical culture and,\u0014\n                        instead, its people can join the rest of the \nworld in worrying\u0014\n                        about the threat from McDonalds and \nBaywatch. That\u0014\n                        kind of anti-Americanism will be a sign of a \nhealthy political\u0014\n                        culture.\u0014\n                               \u0014\n\u0014\n                        With Christopher Dickey in Amman and Cairo\u0014",

    "words": "Harriet Tubman: \nMoses of the Civil War \u0014\n\u0014\n            (This article originally appeared in the Sweetwater \nReporter News April 5, 1992)\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Russell Smith \u0014\n\u0014\nA mystic railroad without tracks wound its way across America over \none hundred and fifty years ago. The\u0014\nrailroad, nicknamed the Underground Railroad, was a misnomer because \nit was neither underground nor\u0014\na railroad. The name was a secret codeword invented for the escape \nroute used by southern slaves in\u0014\nthe pre-Civil War days. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe slaves were aided by thousands of \"conductors\" who used covered \nwagons or carts with false\u0014\nbottoms to carry slaves from one \"station\" to another. With the help \nof 3,000 conductors over 100,000\u0014\nslaves escaped to freedom. Escaping slaves were called \"passengers\" \nor \"merchandise\" on their\u0014\njourney to freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne enterprising slave really did qualify for the nickname of \nmerchandise. Henry \"Box\" Brown had\u0014\nhimself nailed in a wooden box and mailed from Richmond to \nPhiladelphia on a real train. He mailed\u0014\nhimself to a well-known \"brakeman,\" William Still, the author of a \nbook entitled \"Underground Railroad.\"\u0014\nDespite a hard trip (for part of the journey Brown's box was set \nupside down which made for less than\u0014\nideal traveling comfort!), when Still opened the box, out popped \nHenry Brown. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the more famous conductors were: Salmon P. Chase, who as Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court\u0014\nwould later preside over Andrew Johnson's impeachment and is also the \nportrait on the $10,000 bill;\u0014\nElijah F. Pennypacker; Lucretia Mott; Levi Coffin; the ill-fated John \nBrown; the charismatic Frederick\u0014\nDouglass; and the legendary Harriet Tubman. \u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet Tubman was the greatest single conductor in the history of \nthe Underground Railroad. An\u0014\nescaped slave herself, Tubman earned the nickname \"Moses\" for her \nheroic exploits in leading slaves to\u0014\nthe promised land. Returning nineteen times to the dangerous South, \nTubman led more than 300 slaves\u0014\nto freedom, including her own aged parents. \u0014\n\u0014\nEnraged Southern planters offered $40,000 for her capture without \nsuccess. The wily and fearless\u0014\nTubman carried a pistol on her freedom raids and if a slave had \nsecond thoughts about escaping she\u0014\npulled her gun and said: \"You'll be free or die!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTubman was widely read about and talked about, although she herself \nwas unable to read or write. Two of\u0014\nher most famous sayings were: \"Lord, you have been with me through \nsix troubles. Be with me in the\u0014\nseventh.\" And \"I nebber run my train off de track and I nebber lost a \npassenger.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTubman's amazing successes sprang in part from her quick and \ninventive mind. On one occasion, fearing\u0014\npursuers were close at hand, she and her fugitives boarded a \nsouthbound train to avoid suspicion. On\u0014\nanother rescue mission, Tubman had just purchased some live chickens \nwhen she saw her former\u0014\nmaster. She threw down the chickens and chased after them before he \ncould recognize her. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe also had a wry sense of humor. By 1851 the Fugitive Slave Law was \nforcing conductors to lead slaves\u0014\nall the way to Canada. On one such trip a very frightened slave would \nnot say a word or even look at the\u0014\nscenery while crossing into Canada with Tubman on a real train. But \nwhen the man realized he was on\u0014\nfree soil, he began to sing and shout so loud that no one could shut \nhim up. An exasperated Tubman\u0014\nfinally cried out, \"You old fool, you! You might at least have looked \nat Niagara Falls on the way to\u0014\nfreedom!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLike another famous American, Andrew Jackson, Tubman was a victim of \nbrutality at an early age. While\u0014\nyoung Jackson was slashed across the face with a sword for refusing \nto wipe mud off a British officer's\u0014\nboots, Tubman received a fractured skull at age 13 while defending \nanother slave from a cruel master. \u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet Tubman continued her courageous exploits during the Civil \nWar. She became a nurse, scout, and\u0014\nspy for the Union armies. In one campaign she personally led 750 \nSouthern slaves to freedom. General\u0014\nSaxon reported she \"made many a raid inside the enemy lines, \ndisplaying remarkable courage, zeal, and\u0014\nfidelity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet \"Moses\" Tubman lived into her nineties and died in 1913 (her \nbirthdate has never been verified\u0014\nand estimates range from 1816 to 1823 for her birth year). Millions \nof slaves admired her brave life and\u0014\nthe many escaped slaves who owed their freedom to Tubman probably \nfelt as Harriet Tubman did when\u0014\nshe said, \"I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person now I \nwas free. Dere was such a glory trou\u0014\nde trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven.\"\u0014",

Himmler organized the\u0014\n                   Einsatzgrouppen, and convinced the mass murderers \nthat they are doing a necessary job of\u0014\n                   cleansing the Fatherland of their enemies. It was \nHimmler, who after witnessing an exemplary\u0014\n                   execution in Minsk, ordered the search of more \nefficient killing methods - gassing. Himmler\u0014\n                   was in total command of the vast network of death \nfactories, various concentration camps. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler, born in 1900, was brought up in the \nstrictest observance of the Catholic faith, but\u0014\n                   soon drifted away from the Church. He remained a \ndeep mystic with romantic notions about\u0014\n                   the German past and the role of the blood and \npeasants in the future of Germany. After\u0014\n                   drifting away from the Catholicism, Himmler needed \na substitution hero to worship, and he\u0014\n                   found his idol in the new German Messiah- Adolph \nHitler.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler was strongly devoted to Hitler, and \nfollowed his orders blindly. Himmler is quoted\u0014\n                   saying that:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Hitler is a genius such as only appears once \nin every thousand years, and the\u0014\n                        greatest among them. He is a predator being, \none inspired. He is all wise, all\u0014\n                        powerful. The German people have only to \nfollow him blindly in order to reach the\u0014\n                        zenith of their history.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler started the SS organization with 280 men, \nand through shrewd and patient work,\u0014\n                   compiling dossiers on all real and imaginary \nenemies he built up Hitler's trust by his devotion,\u0014\n                   organizational skills and thoroughness. In 1931 \nHimmler found an unexpected ally, Rheinhard\u0014\n                   Heydrich. Heydrich had a superior intelligence, \nimaginative cruelty, complete lack of moral\u0014\n                   restraints, superior manipulative skills, and he \nhelped him with ideas in the constant infighting\u0014\n                   at Hitler's court. The combination of Himmler' \norganizational talent, and Heydrich's superior\u0014\n                   intelligence and ruthlessness changed the destiny \nof Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler was successful in amassing personal power, \nwithin a short period of time of a few\u0014\n                   years, he extended the SS from a platoon size to \nan independent Army of 370,000 people.\u0014\n                   The SS commanded a vast empire of concentration \ncamps, multiple economic enterprises,\u0014\n                   armament factories based on the slave labor of \nmillions of concentration camp inmates.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler the Mass Murderer of the modern times, was \na man of limited intelligence and\u0014\n                   intellectual ability, with romantic delusions of \nbeing a Teutonic Knight who will extend the\u0014\n                   historical expansion of the German nation \neastwardly; he believed in Hitler's extraordinary\u0014\n                   powers. Himmler had only brute force at his \ncommand, but he was not powerful in his own\u0014\n                   right, his power depended on Hitler.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In the last days of war he was trying to negotiate \na separate peace but with his indecisiveness,\u0014\n                   when acting on his own, he failed completely. \" \nGiven his respectable background and\u0014\n                   bourgeois appearance, it seem hard to believe that \nhe will become the greatest criminal of all\u0014\n                   time. Colorlessly average and dependent, but \ndevoid of feelings and overeager in the carrying\u0014\n                   out of all plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler was a shy inhibited person.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Among Himmler's characteristics was an \nalmost neurotic shyness. At big\u0014\n                        receptions he always avoided crowds and went \nfrom group to group. When\u0014\n                        important generals came to report to him, he \nhumiliated and demoralized them by\u0014\n                        making them wait three or four days before \nseeing them.... After each interview ,\u0014\n                        Himmler would say to Kersten, \"Thank God, I \nwont have to see them for another\u0014\n                        two months.\" Himmler was only at ease behind \nhis desk; he fought a paper war.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   \"For Himmler-the puny, sickly pedant, as \nundernourished physically as well as morally, and\u0014\n                   whose life was strictly regulated between his \npaperwork, his diet, his wife and his mistress, all\u0014\n                   equally insignificant-dreamed of being the \nembodiment of the superman.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler was afraid of Hitler's scolding, and even \nat the last stages of war, when Himmler\u0014\n                   commanded the S.S. a private army of half a \nmillion people , and Hitler's health and position\u0014\n                   deteriorated significantly, Himmler could not \nstand up to his Fuhrer. Himmler was more of\u0014\n                   realist, who understood the hopeless military \nsituation of Germany, he secretly conducted\u0014\n                   negotiation with Count Bernadette of Sweden, \nreleased some prisoners form the\u0014\n                   concentration camps, even met an emissary of the \nAmerican Joint Committee, but did not\u0014\n                   have the guts to depose Hitler and finish the war. \nWith all his realism Himmler did not\u0014\n                   understand his own responsibility for the \natrocities committed by the Nazi regime, the\u0014\n                   concentration camps, the slave labor, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler was building an independent Totalitarian \nSS State, a State within a State and he had\u0014\n                   economic interest in the Holocaust. The SS was \nofficially only the military organization of the\u0014\n                   Nazi Party, and as such it was not supported by \nthe State; looting of the victims possessions\u0014\n                   and income from the many economic enterprises \nexploiting slave labor was the sole means of\u0014\n                   support of the SS. At the height of the war \nHimmler commanded a force of half million people\u0014\n                   that had to be fed and armed, without receiving a \npenny from the Reich. It is doubtful that\u0014\n                   without the Holocaust Himmler could have achieve \nhis goals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Like any dependent person Himmler had a \nrationalization for his actions; at the meeting with\u0014\n                   the representative of the Jewish Congress at the \nfinal days of the war, made the following\u0014\n                   explanations about the reasons of murdering the \neastern Jews:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"These men helped the Resistance, they fired \non our troops from their ghettos.\u0014\n                        And, moreover, they carry diseases such as \ntyphus. It was to stop epidemics that\u0014\n                        we sent them to the ovens....The \nconcentration camps! They should be called\u0014\n                        education camps. Thanks to them, Germany had \nher lowest crime rate in 1941.\u0014\n                        It's true that the prisoners had to work hard \nthere. But all Germans work hard\".\u0014\n\u0014\n                   On October 4, 1943 Himmler addressed the SS \ngenerals at Poznan and gave quite another\u0014\n                   explanation for the Holocaust.. .. I also want to \ntalk to you frankly on a grave matter...the\u0014\n                   extermination of the Jewish race. This is one of \nthose things that are easily said. \"the Jewish\u0014\n                   people is gong to be annihilated.\" says every \nparty member. \"Sure, it's in our program,\u0014\n                   elimination of the Jews, annihilation-we'll take \ncare of it.\" And then they all come trudging,\u0014\n                   eighty millions worthy Germans, and each one has \nhis one decent Jew. Sure, the others are\u0014\n                   swine, but this one is an A1 Jew. Of all those who \ntalk this way, not one has seen it happen,\u0014\n                   not one has been through it. Most of you know what \nit means when 100 corpses are lying side\u0014\n                   by side, or 500, or 1000. To have stuck it out and \nat the same time-apart from exceptions\u0014\n                   caused by human weaknesses-to have remained decent \nfellows, that is what made us hard.\u0014\n                   This page of glory in our history which has never \nbeen written and it's never to be written....\u0014\n                   FALL P 966\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Himmler's contributions to the Final Solution are \ntwofold; he created the S.S. machinery and\u0014\n                   the death industry. He also romanticized the \ncruelty as a historical necessity.\u0014",

Heydrich was the \ntrailblazer, who hew the new trails and\u0014\n                   harnessed the German organizational genius in \nservice of cruelty terror and destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Heydrich had an incredible acute perception \nof the moral, human, professional\u0014\n                        and political weaknesses of others and he \nalso had the ability to grasp a political\u0014\n                        situation in its entirety. His unusual \nintellect was matched by he ever-watchful\u0014\n                        instincts of a predatory animal, always alert \nto danger and ready to act swiftly and\u0014\n                        ruthlessly\".\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich joined the German Navy, after the end of \nthe First World War, and was promoted to\u0014\n                   the rank of a lieutenant. In 1930 he was forced to \nresign by an Officers Court of Honor,\u0014\n                   because he impregnated a girl and refused to marry \nher. In 1931, while unemployed, he was\u0014\n                   recommended to Himmler and was assigned to \norganize the internal Nazi Party Security\u0014\n                   Service, later known as the infamous SD \n(Sicherheit Dienst-Security Service) and later\u0014\n                   became Himmler's deputy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich was the evil genius of the Third Reich; \nit was Heydrich that changed the role of the\u0014\n                   police in the Totalitarian State from an \ninstrument of law and order to an instrument of\u0014\n                   oppression of the citizens, to prevent them from \nacting against the interest of the State. It was\u0014\n                   a novel, revolutionary idea to put citizens into \nconcentration camp not for offenses committed,\u0014\n                   but to prevent them from thinking about committing \noffenses against the Fuhrer. Heydrich\u0014\n                   organized and took part in all the dirty tricks of \nthe Third Reich: burning of the Reichstag that\u0014\n                   gave Hitler the pretext of assuming dictatorial \npowers, the Night of the Long Knights-the killing\u0014\n                   of Roehm and disbanding of the SA, the \nassassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss that\u0014\n                   paved the way of annexation of the Austria, \nengineering of the border incidents that give Hitler\u0014\n                   the excuse to attack Poland in 1939. Heydrich's \neven sold to the Stalin's Intelligence Service\u0014\n                   faked documents incriminating the Russian Marshall \nTuchaczesky and other Generals.\u0014\n                   Consequently Stalin eliminated all the implicated \nofficers, thus weakening significantly the Red\u0014\n                   Army.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich was an intelligent, cold blooded \nindividual, compulsively trying to prove his\u0014\n                   superiority. Of a keen and quick intelligence, he \nexcelled equally in tests of strength and\u0014\n                   cunning. He practiced fencing and pistol shooting \nevery day. He had a relish for danger in its\u0014\n                   extreme form. An amateur pilot, he had not been \nable to rest until Goering let him go on\u0014\n                   hunting expeditions -flying missions, where sixty \nmissions had earned him the Cross of Iron,\u0014\n                   First Class. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        \" This man (Heydrich) was the hidden pivot \naround which the Nazi regime\u0014\n                        revolved. The development of a whole nation \nwas guided indirectly by this forceful\u0014\n                        character. He was far superior to all his \npolitical colleagues and controlled them\u0014\n                        as he controlled the vast intelligence \nmachine of the SD (Sicherheit Dienst).\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Heydrich was a master manipulator, he \nmanipulated everybody, including\u0014\n                        Himmler and Hitler. He used his extensive \nknowledge of the weaknesses and\u0014\n                        ambitions of others, to render them dependent \non himself. This enabled him to\u0014\n                        hold and manipulate the balance of power in a \nmilieu full of intrigue, rivalry and\u0014\n                        animosity, while he himself remained in the \nbackground.

Heydrich\u0014\n                        was, in fact, the puppet master of the third \nReich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"He made Hitler dependent on him by \nfulfilling al his most insane schemes, thus\u0014\n                        making himself indispensable. He supplied \nHimmler with brilliant ideas so that he\u0014\n                        could shine in conferences with Hitler, and \nwould do it so tactfully that Himmler\u0014\n                        never suspected that these ideas were not his \nown.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   After Hitler, it was Heydrich that made the \ngreatest contribution to changing the nightmarish\u0014\n                   dream of destroying the Jews into reality. It was \nHeydrich who initiated the tearing down the\u0014\n                   fabric of the Jewish society through starvation \ncoupled with terror and senseless brutality, the\u0014\n                   extensive use of victims in the process of their \nown destruction, the camouflaging the gas\u0014\n                   chambers as showers for disinfection, the inciting \nstarved people to volunteer to \"resettlement\"\u0014\n                   by offering them bread and sugar, bringing Jews \nfrom the west in first class railroad cars with\u0014\n                   dining cars to Auschwitz. All the dirty tricks \nplayed on the hapless victims, bear the stamp of\u0014\n                   Heydrich's personality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich was put in charge of the settling the \nJewish question and all the annihilation process\u0014\n                   bears the imprint of his \"dirty tricks\" on a \ngigantic scale. Heydrich was blazing ingeniously new\u0014\n                   trails in human cruelty, in completely uncharted \nwaters of human behavior. Heydrich perceived\u0014\n                   quite rightly that it is easier to convert a group \nof ordinary people into mass murderers than to\u0014\n                   make a single murderer from an ordinary \nindividual. He personally selected the\u0014\n                   Einsatzgrouppen from ordinary people, not \npsychopaths; they were bankers, policemen, clerks\u0014\n                   and even one pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich was one of those gifted individuals who \ncan do perfectly whatever they set out to\u0014\n                   accomplish. A restless ambition to excel at any \nprice dogged him all his life, he played the\u0014\n                   violin, skied, fenced, pilot an plane and \nundertake any office. He was the most dangerous man\u0014\n                   in Germany. Heydrich had big ambitions, he wanted \nto become Reichsminister and maybe the\u0014\n                   next leader of Germany. Hitler found that the best \nway to deal with Himmler is to multiple his\u0014\n                   responsibilities, and the best way to deal with \nHeydrich is to divide his responsibilities. In\u0014\n                   Germany it was not possible to attain office and \nto remain in office without using blackmail. The\u0014\n                   were rumors that Heydrich was of Jewish origin \n(His grandfather was named Sus, a Jewish\u0014\n                   name), and this fact was used by Himmler to keep \nHeydrich in check, because of his\u0014\n                   vulnerability to blackmail.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Heydrich was nominated by Hitler as the Protector \nof Czechoslovakia, and on this post he\u0014\n                   performed a very good job; Heydrich introduced a \nseries of liberalizing moves, decreased the\u0014\n                   level terror, increased the food rations. The \nCzechoslovakian Government in Exile afraid of\u0014\n                   losing it's influence ordered his killing. \nHeydrich was killed by agents of the Czechoslovakian\u0014\n                   Government in exile on June 4, 1942. His death \ncontributed to the partial survival of the Jews\u0014\n                   in Bulgaria, France and Hungary. After Heydrich's \ndeath the execution of the Final Solution\u0014\n                   rested in the hands of Himmler, who pursued it \nwith brutal force, but the cunning, bluffing and\u0014\n                   superior intelligence of Heydrich was gone. It is \ndoubtful that with Heydrich being alive the Jews\u0014\n                   in France, Hungary, Bulgaria would have survived. \nEichman did not have the standing and\u0014\n                   ability of Heydrich. It also worth noting that in \nOctober of 1944, Himmler suspended the mass\u0014\n                   killing, disregarding Hitler's orders and \noverruling the objection of the head of Gestapo, Miller.\u0014\n                   It is safe to assume that if Heydrich would have \nbeen killed earlier more Jews would have\u0014\n                   survived. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                kimel@systec.com\u0014",

    "words": "HITLER AND \nTHE JEWS\u0014\n                                     Written by Alexander Kimel - \nHolocaust Survivor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   There is no doubt that Hitler passionately hated \nthe Jews. It was a subconscio\u0014\n\u0014\n                   us need of finding scapegoats for his inner \nconflicts, and frustrations. Neither in the Mein\u0014\n                   Kampf nor in any Nazi literature can one find \naccounts of Hitler having unpleasant encounters,\u0014\n                   frictions or quarrels with Jews; it looks like \nthat Hitler had very few personal or social contacts\u0014\n                   with Jews. In 1939 Hitler personally permitted Dr. \nBloch, an Jewish physician to emigrate from\u0014\n                   Austria. Dr. Bloc was the gentle physician who \nprovided intensive care for of his ailing mother,\u0014\n                   and on several occasions Hitler expressed his \ngratitude. Another Jew, who played a positive\u0014\n                   role in Hitler's life was his World War I \ncommanding officer, who recommended Hitler for the\u0014\n                   Iron Cross. It looks like the Jews were for Hitler \nand abstract depersonalized evil, an\u0014\n                   mythological evil like the devil in many \nreligions, nobody ever experienced the devil but in eyes\u0014\n                   of the believers it is a reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler lived in Vienna from 1907 to 1913 and those \nwere the most difficult years of his life.\u0014\n                   Hitler was trying to become an Architect or to \nmake himself a name in field of arts. He was\u0014\n                   twice rejected from the Vienna Academy of Fine \nArts. The second rejection by the Academy\u0014\n                   was one of the most traumatic experience of his \nlife; all his dreams were shattered. After\u0014\n                   discovering that four out of seven professors that \nrejected him were Jewish he blamed the\u0014\n                   Jews for his failure.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   \"Life in Vienna was very rough for Hitler. The \nwinter of 1909 was a severe winter. He was at\u0014\n                   the end of his resources, his hands covered with \nchilblains, his stomach empty; he had been\u0014\n                   begging in the streets, but no one paid any \nattention to him. He had no overcoat, his feet were\u0014\n                   in bad shape, and he walked painfully and slowly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler was living a life on the periphery of the \nSociety, eking out a meager living by peddling of\u0014\n                   his painted postcards, living in a flophouse. In \nMein Kampf Hitler wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"To me Vienna, the city which, to so many, is \nthe epitome of innocent pleasure, a\u0014\n                        festive playground for merrymakers, \nrepresents, I am sorry to say, merely the\u0014\n                        living memory of the saddest period of my \nlife. ... Five years in which I was forced\u0014\n                        to earn a living, first as a day laborers, \nthen as a small painter; a truly meager\u0014\n                        living which never sufficed to appease even \nmy daily hunger. Hunger was then\u0014\n                        my faithful bodyguard. .....The uncertainty \nof earning my dally bread soon\u0014\n                        seemed to me one of the darkest sides of my \nnew life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Even today this city arouse in me nothing but \nthe most dismal thoughts. ... At the\u0014\n                        turn of the century, Vienna was, socially \nspeaking, on of the most backwards\u0014\n                        cities in Europe. Dazzling riches and \nloathsome poverty alternated sharply.... The\u0014\n                        court with its dazzling glamour attracted \nwealth and intelligence from the rest of\u0014\n                        the country like a magnet. ....Outside the \npalaces in the Ring loitered thousands\u0014\n                        of unemployed, and beneath this Via \nTriumphalis of old Austria dwelt the\u0014\n                        homeless in the gloom and mud of the canals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Contrasting to his own failures he saw the \nsuccessful and prospering Jews in all fields of arts\u0014\n                   and culture, business and politics.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        What had to ge reckoned heavily against he \nJew in my eyes was when I became\u0014\n                        acquainted with their activity in the press, \nart, literature, and the theater. . .And\u0014\n                        when I learned to look for the Jew in all \nbranches of cultural and artistic life and its\u0014\n                        various manifestations, I suddenly \nencountered him in a place where I would least\u0014\n                        have expected to find him. . . When I \nrecognized the Jew as the leader of the\u0014\n                        Social Democracy, the scales dropped form my \neyes. A long soul struggle had\u0014\n                        reached its conclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler found his scapegoats.. . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                        My views with regard to anti-Semitism \nsuccumbed to the passage of time, and his\u0014\n                        was my greatest transformation of all.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Gradually, I began to hate them ( the \nJews)....For me this was the time of the\u0014\n                        greatest spiritual upheaval I have ever had \nto go through, I had ceased to be a\u0014\n                        weak-kneed cosmopolitan and become an \nanti-Semite.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler was deeply influenced with all those \nanti-Semitic pamphlets with all their myth of the soil,\u0014\n                   cult for the Nordic, and the romantic longing for \nthe simple, heroic, idealized past. In Mein\u0014\n                   Kampf Hitler wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        For a few hellers (pennies) I bought the \nfirst anti-Semitic pamphlets of my life.\u0014\n                        Unfortunately, they all proceed from the \nsupposition that in principle the reader\u0014\n                        knew or even understood the Jewish question \nto a certain degree. Besides, the\u0014\n                        tone for the most part was such that doubts \nagain arose in me, due in part to the\u0014\n                        dull and amazingly unscientific arguments. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   In Vienna Hitler was also introduced to the Social \nDarwinism subscribing to the idea that\u0014\n                   nations, people, cultures and individuals are \nsubject to the same laws of natural selection as\u0014\n                   plants and animals. Life is a perpetual struggle, \nbetween individuals and nations for existence,\u0014\n                   with the survival of the stronger and more brutal \nand the elimination of the weaker and less fit.\u0014\n                   In my Kampf Hitler writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Humanity will be compelled , in consequence \nof the impossibility of making the\u0014\n                        fertility of the soil keep pace with the \ncontinuous increase of population, to halt\u0014\n                        the increase in human race. ....Nature has \nnot reserved the soil for the future\u0014\n                        possession of any particular nation; but for \nthe people that have the force to take\u0014\n                        it and the industry to cultivate it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler developed an violent outlook on life; \nnatural laws are based on violence, and only\u0014\n                   through violence and brutal force can social \nproblems be solved. Democracy is the enemy of\u0014\n                   the people, because it inhibits brutality, and \ncorrupts the character of the people. In Mein\u0014\n                   Kampf Hitler writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Either the world will be ruled according to \nthe ideas of democracy, or the world will\u0014\n                        be dominated according to the natural law of \nforce; in the latter case the people\u0014\n                        of brute force will be victorious.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   For Hitler life was a constant struggle, a \nstruggle between individuals, people, races, a\u0014\n                   struggle between Nordic culture- creators, and \nSemitic culture-destroyers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In the eyes of Hitler the Jews were also \nresponsible for all social vices including prostitution\u0014\n                   and white-slave traffic:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        I recognized the Jew as the cold-hearted, \nshameless and calculating director of\u0014\n                        this revolting vice traffic in the scum of \nthe big city, a cold shudder ran down my\u0014\n                        back...\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In anti-Semitism Hitler found an explanation for \nhis failures, a rationalization for his sufferings -\u0014\n                   the Jews and their conspiracy. The Jews were the \nsingle cause of his tensions and humiliation.\u0014\n                   Hitler adopted the crude simplistic outlook on \nlife: the Jews are the source of all evil in this\u0014\n                   world. Hitler found a purpose in life, cleansing \nthe German race from the clutches of the Jews.\u0014\n                   Hatred of the Jews became his obsession, his \ncreed, faith and religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler became also obsessed with the preservation \nof the purity of the Nordic race. The world\u0014\n                   is an arena for the ongoing struggle between Gog \nand Almagog, between the pure and the\u0014\n                   defiled, between the Aryans and the Jews. Hitler \nwas a megalomaniac, a man with an\u0014\n                   exaggerated notion about himself, the slightest \nsign of disrespect or even an argument threw\u0014\n                   him into a fury and frenzy. Hitler was full of \nhatred and tensions, and this hatred had to find an\u0014\n                   outlet, an enemy, the Jews the capitalists and the \nJews the communists, were a convenient\u0014\n                   enemy. By adapting a notion of superiority of the \nAryan race he found an explanation for his\u0014\n                   overblown feeling of superiority.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   There is no doubt that in Vienna Hitler acquired \nhis basic outlook on life, his ideas about the\u0014\n                   importance of terror, the purity of the Nordic \nrace and his rabbit anti-Semitism. There is no\u0014\n                   doubt that Hitler hated the Jews passionately, \nwith a fervor approaching religious fanaticism. It\u0014\n                   was the foundation of his life outlook and \nphilosophy. \" Hitler's career was more closely\u0014\n                   parallel to that of a charismatic religious leader \nthan of any conventional political leader. His\u0014\n                   feelings about the Jews in particular had the \nquality of a religious passion; they were dead\u0014\n                   serious convictions intimately associated with \ncrucial events in his life, and its no exaggeration\u0014\n                   to suggest that his Jew-hatred was probably the \nmost consistent central dimension of his\u0014\n                   chaotic personality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   There is no doubt that Hitler's anti-Semitism had \ndeep psychological roots. But regardless of\u0014\n                   what psychological mechanism we ascribe to his \npathological hatred, one important factor was\u0014\n                   Hitler's lack of sexuality, the point stressed by \nmany observers of his entourage. For example\u0014\n                   Walter Schellenberg, describes a report in \nHeydrich's possession stated:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Hitler was ruled by demonic forces driving \nhim that he ceased to have thoughts\u0014\n                        of normal cohabitation with a woman. The \necstasies of power in every form were\u0014\n                        sufficient for him. During his speeches he \nworked himself up to such orgiastic\u0014\n                        frenzies that he achieved complete emotional \nsatisfaction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler's abnormal sexual development is an \nimportant factor in his behavior. \"It is well known\u0014\n                   that Hitler's sex life was bizarre. As a young \nman, he repressed direct sexuality and projected\u0014\n                   his erotic energy in grandiose fantasies. In his \nthirties, he was consistently attracted to young\u0014\n                   childlike women who clearly resembled his mother. \nThe could, therefore, be more easily\u0014\n                   dominated than mature women but at the same time \nserve as a symbolically mother figure.\u0014\n                   Waites review of the material concerning Hitler's \nrelationship with women makes it quite clear\u0014\n                   that he had an intense, unusual effect on them, \nprobably because of his odd sexual demands.\u0014\n                   ....Virtually every one of at least several young \nwomen who were close to Hitler attempted or\u0014\n                   succeeded in committing suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In 1945 the Russian conducted an autopsy of \nHitler's burned body and issued a report that\u0014\n                   Hitler had a sexual deformation, having only one \ntesticle. \" Based on a controversial Soviet\u0014\n                   medical report on Hitler's dead body which showed \nthat he had only one testicle. Waites\u0014\n                   argues that this condition occurs frequently \nenough in otherwise normal males to be generally\u0014\n                   considered a minor anomaly, although it can be a \nsource of severe anxiety. This condition was\u0014\n                   responsible for his (Hitler's) sexual repression \nand consequent inability to benefit from any\u0014\n                   normal form of direct sensuality. His intense \ngrandiose ambitions, then, can be seen as an\u0014\n                   effort to compensate for basic feeling of \ninferiority and isolation. In this connection, his\u0014\n                   irrational hatred of the Jews, with its specific \nsexual references to Jews as seducers of\u0014\n                   innocent young women, also falls into place as a \nprotective defense mechanism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   But regardless of the theories of the mechanism \nand the origins of his pathological hatred, his\u0014\n                   lack of sexuality, none of the theories explains \nwhy and how was this hatred converted into\u0014\n                   actions resulting in the horrible reality of the \nHolocaust. Was this the working of normal mind?\u0014\n                   Human history experienced many rulers that killed \ncompulsively like Caligula, Nero, and they\u0014\n                   were all branded as madmen. Was Hitler rational or \ninsane?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                kimel@systec.com\u0014",

One of the\u0014\n                   mysteries not covered in the Mein Kampf is why did \nHitler not serve in the Austrian Army. Hitler\u0014\n                   was born in 1889, and in 1910 , at the age of 21, \nhe was subject to the conscription to the\u0014\n                   Imperial Austrian Army. In 1913 Hitler suddenly \nleft Vienna for Bavarian, without being drafted\u0014\n                   into the Army. Hitler either dodged the draft or \nwas found unfit to serve for health reasons.\u0014\n                   Knowing Hitler's militaristic outlook it is \ndoubtful that he was a draft dodger, so health must\u0014\n                   have been the problem. Ernest Hanfstaengl- a \nmember of Hitler's entourage writes in his\u0014\n                   memoirs about Hitler's syphilis and congenital \nproblems:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        From watching Hitler and talking to those \ncloser to him, I had formed the firm\u0014\n                        conviction that he was impotent, the \nrepressed type. Hitler's repressed\u0014\n                        homosexuality probably dated from the time in \nVienna when he caught syphilis in\u0014\n                        Vienna about 1908. . . . One thing that \nbecame borne in on me very early was the\u0014\n                        absence of a vital factor in Hitler's \nexistence. He had no normal sex life. . . It was\u0014\n                        part of hidden complexes and a constitutional \ninsufficiency which may have been\u0014\n                        congenital and may have resulted from a \nsyphilitic infection during his youth in\u0014\n                        Vienna.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In 1914, after the outbreak of the World War I, \nHitler volunteered to the Bavarian Army and\u0014\n                   was accepted. It is probable that in 1914 the \nsickness was partially healed, the outward\u0014\n                   symptoms disappeared and in the general upheaval \ncaused by the outbreak of the war the\u0014\n                   physical examination was not to thorough. Syphilis \nis a very unusual disease, with very\u0014\n                   unusual patterns. The basic primary stage begins \nafter an approximate 3 week incubation\u0014\n                   period. During this stage all symptoms appear; \nrash, breaks in the skin, sores, and a person\u0014\n                   feels generally unwell. After a period of about 9 \nmonths, all the symptoms disappear, even\u0014\n                   without any treatment, and the latent stage \nstarts. In the latent stage a person is not infectious\u0014\n                   and syphilis can only be detected through the \nblood test. The latent stage lasts from 1 to 50\u0014\n                   years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In the last and final stage - the tertiary stage \nthe disease causes permanent damage of parts\u0014\n                   of the body; ulcers of the skin, lesions on \nligaments bones or joints. Tertiary syphilis is most\u0014\n                   serious when it attacks heart, the brain or the \nnervous system. When syphilis attacks the brain\u0014\n                   it causes the inflammation of the brain, called \n\"encephalitis\". Today syphilis is a curable\u0014\n                   affliction and it is almost extinct, but in the \nthirties it was quite frequent. In a 1930 published\u0014\n                   textbook \"The Human Mind\", Karl Menninger gives \nthe following description od syphilis:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Many people who have syphilis don't know they \nhave it. Those who do know it\u0014\n                        rarely suspect the possibility of its \naffecting the nervous system. Brain syphilis\u0014\n                        follows original infection by many years. It \nis difficult for the public to realize that\u0014\n                        syphilis far more frequently betrays itself \nby queer conduct than by starting skin\u0014\n                        eruptions. Brain syphilis may exist for years \nwithout being suspected by anyone,\u0014\n                        least by the victim.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   When the sickness attack the nervous system it is \ncalled neurosyphilis, and it can kill, paralyze\u0014\n                   or render insane. The psychosis caused by \nencephalitis or neurosyphilis is accompanied by\u0014\n                   progressive paralysis, and it is called general \nparesis. It is almost certain that Hitler caught\u0014\n                   syphilis in Vienna. In summer of 1942 Himmler was \nseriously considering the removal of Hitler\u0014\n                   from power, and showed Felix Kersten his \nconfidante, a thick folder containing a report\u0014\n                   relating to Hitler's syphilis:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        The report was twenty-six pages long and was \na compendium of all Hitler's\u0014\n                        medical reports since the time he had been \ntreated for serious eye trouble at the\u0014\n                        hospital in Pasewalk. The following facts \nwere established: In his youth, Hitler\u0014\n                        contracted syphilis, he had left Pasewalk \napparently cured, but in 1937 symptoms\u0014\n                        appeared the showed beyond all possible \ndoubts that the disease was still active.\u0014\n                        Finally at the beginning of 1942, the current \nyear, there had been manifestation\u0014\n                        which made it evident that the Fuhrer was \nsuffering from progressive syphilitic\u0014\n                        paralysis.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Because of the disease Hitler was exempt from the \nservice in the Austrian Army. In about 1914\u0014\n                   the symptoms of the syphilis disappeared and the \nlatent stage started. The disease was not\u0014\n                   treated and the infection remained latent, until \nit resurfaced in 1935, with start of the final\u0014\n                   tertiary stage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   It is also possible to pinpoint the approximate of \nthe acquisition of this affliction. In 1908 Hitler\u0014\n                   shared a room in Vienna at Stumpergasse with his \nchildhood friend Kubizek. In August of 1908\u0014\n                   Kubizek went visit his parents in Linz, and Hitler \nremained alone in the room, rented from Frau\u0014\n                   Zakreys. On November 20, 1908 Kubizek returned to \nVienna and to his amazement\u0014\n                   discovered that his friend Hitler moved out \nsuddenly taking all his possessions, leaving no\u0014\n                   message and no forwarding address. Hitler vanished.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Unknown to Kubizek, Adolf was living only a \nfew blocks away from his old\u0014\n                        lodgings. In Austria every change of address \nhas to be reported to the police and\u0014\n                        accordingly on November 18 he signed a police \nregistration giving his address as\u0014\n                        Room 16/22 Felbergasse....The new room had \nmore light than Frau Zakreys's\u0014\n                        room and cost more money. He liked the place \nwell enough to stay there for eight\u0014\n                        months, living alone, rarely leaving his \nroom, speaking to scarcely anyone, and\u0014\n                        having no visible occupation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   It is save to assume that Hitler's strange \nbehavior was due to the affliction that Hitler acquired,\u0014\n                   and syphilis was the cause the break with his \nfriend and the strange solitary life. In my Kampf\u0014\n                   Hitler shows a tremendous preoccupation with \nsyphilis. Two whole sections were devoted to\u0014\n                   syphilis. Hitler wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Particularly with regard to syphilis, the \nattitude of the leadership of the nation and\u0014\n                        the state can only be designated as total \ncapitulation. ..This Jewification of our\u0014\n                        spiritual life and mammonization of our \nmating instincts will sooner or later destroy\u0014\n                        our entire offspring... To fight it \nseriously, they would have to take somewhat\u0014\n                        broader measures ..For, seriously to attack \nthis plaque, tremendous sacrifices\u0014\n                        and equally great labors are necessary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        The fight syphilis demands a fight against \nprostitution, against prejudices, old\u0014\n                        habits, against previous conceptions, general \nviews among them not least the\u0014\n                        false prudery of certain circles.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In 1935 Hitler fell ill, he complained about \ncardiac pains, excessive gasses and insomnia, but\u0014\n                   refused to be examined by a doctor. Speer writes \nin his memoirs:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Hitler was never seriously examined at the \ntime but experimented with treating his\u0014\n                        symptoms by his own theories.....Later he was \npersuaded to undergo an\u0014\n                        examination by Morell (Dr. Theodore Morell, \nspecialist in skin and venereal\u0014\n                        diseases)...... The other injections and \ndrugs he gave to Hitler were not generally\u0014\n                        known; they were only hinted at. ... And in \nfact the injections had to be given\u0014\n                        more and more frequently. ...One day Goering \ndeeply offended Morell by\u0014\n                        addressing him as \"Herr Reich Injection \nMaster.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   At the end of the war Hitler's health deteriorated \nsignificantly, and there was a general opinion\u0014\n                   that Hitler suffered from Parkinson's disease. In \n1945, General Guderian, visited Hitler in his\u0014\n                   bunker under the Reich Chancery and describes \nHitler appearance:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        It was no longer simply his left hand, but \nthe whole left side of his body that\u0014\n                        trembled.... He walked awkwardly, stooped \nmore than ever, and his gestures were\u0014\n                        both jerky and slow. He had to have a chair \npushed beneath him when he wished\u0014\n                        to sit down. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hitler's armament minister and close collaborator \nSpeer also visited Hitler in his bunker in\u0014\n                   Berlin, and gave a more vivid description of \nHitler, sickness:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Now, he was shriveling up like an old man. \nHis limbs trembled; he walked\u0014\n                        stooped, with dragging footsteps. Even his \nvoice became quavering and lost\u0014\n                        masterfulness.....When he became excited, as \nhe frequently did in a senile way,\u0014\n                        his voice started breaking. .......His \ncomplexion was sallow, his face swollen; his\u0014\n                        uniform, which in the past he had kept \nscrupulously neat, was often neglected in\u0014\n                        this last period of life and stained by the \nfood he had eaten with a shaking\u0014\n                        hand....I was constantly tempted to pity \nhim......in the hopeless situation, he\u0014\n                        continued to commit nonexistent divisions, or \nto order units supplied by planes\u0014\n                        could no longer fly for lack of fuel. ...He \nfrequently took flight from reality and\u0014\n                        entered his world of fantasy....he claimed he \nwas in a position to conquer\u0014\n                        Bolshevism by the strength of his personality \nand in alliance with the West.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Outwardly the symptoms remind Parkinsonism, a \ndisease due to the degeneration of the\u0014\n                   nerve cells in one part of the brain, usually as a \nresult of arteriosclerosis. It manifests itself in\u0014\n                   trembling and muscular rigidity that interferes \nwith all movements, from facial expression to\u0014\n                   locomotion. It occurs fairly often in old age. \nHitler was at that time 56 years old, and besides\u0014\n                   the trembling and stooping he showed signs of \nflight from reality. Parkinson's disease does\u0014\n                   not affect the functioning of the brain just the \nmotor coordination. Hitler's moodiness, flight\u0014\n                   from reality, fits of temper, sulkiness indicate \nthe disease to be general paresis, and very often\u0014\n                   paresis is accompanied by the Parkinson's disease.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   The psychological symptoms of paresis are \nmegalomania, paranoia, lack of sense of reality,\u0014\n                   dulling of the moral senses.

The Bible says that \"the \nsecret things belong to the\u0014\n                      Lord our God\" (Deut. 29:29, NIV). And yet this \nis a natural and\u0014\n                      reasonable question to ask. We can say four \nthings in response: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      First, everything God does, by either explicit \ndecree or permission, has\u0014\n                      an ultimate beneficial purpose. This includes \nthe fact of hell and God's\u0014\n                      judgment against rebellious sinners, as well as \nthe blessings of heaven\u0014\n                      and salvation in Christ. Love and holiness are \nboth essential attributes\u0014\n                      of God, and they are not in competition with \none another. As with Job,\u0014\n                      in the face of suffering and mystery we are \ntempted to accuse God of\u0014\n                      wrongdoing and put him in the dock. But God's \nanswer to Job reaches\u0014\n                      us as well: \"Would you condemn me to justify \nyourself?\" (Job 40:8).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, this question assumes that human beings \nare victims caught\u0014\n                      in the vise of an inexorable fate. But the \nBible teaches that God in his\u0014\n                      goodness has created a world of moral order, \none in which men and\u0014\n                      women are free moral agents. By creating Adam \nand Eve in his image\u0014\n                      and likeness, God gave them a quality of \nrelationship with him that no\u0014\n                      other creature has. God's creative act was so \ngreat that he trusted\u0014\n                      them with freedom. Unfortunately, freedom \nincludes the freedom to turn\u0014\n                      away from God, and that is what Adam and Eve \ndid. The fact that God\u0014\n                      knew beforehand what they would do in no way \nabrogated their\u0014\n                      capacity to act and do as they chose. God \ncondemns no one unjustly.\u0014\n                      God is the judge of all the earth, and he will \ndo right by everyone. On\u0014\n                      the final day of judgment, no one will be able \nto stand before God and\u0014\n                      say to him, \"I have been treated unfairly by \nyou!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course, exactly how the inequities of this \nlife will be seen in the\u0014\n                      tapestry of eternity remains imponderable. But \nwe do know that God's\u0014\n                      plan is free and purposive, that he does not \ncompel or coerce human\u0014\n                      creatures made in his image, and that nothing \ncan ultimately thwart\u0014\n                      his glory and grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Third, it may seem that we can get God off the \nhook by denying his\u0014\n                      absolute foreknowledge of future events, by \nseeing Creation as an\u0014\n                      open-ended experiment about which even God is \nin the dark. Rather\u0014\n                      than taking the problem of evil seriously, \nthough, such a view of God\u0014\n                      trivializes it. We would not praise a doctor \nwho produced horrible\u0014\n                      deformities while experimenting with human \ncloning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor can we find solace in a disabled deity \nwhose creative power\u0014\n                      unleashes a floodtide of suffering and evil \nover which he has no certain\u0014\n                      knowledge and only limited control. Such a god \nmight deserve to be\u0014\n                      pitiedbut not worshiped and adored. This is \nwhy orthodox Christians\u0014\n                      of all confessions have affirmed God's complete \nforeknowledge of the\u0014\n                      future, however much they may have differed on \nissues such as\u0014\n                      election and predestination.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, Jesus Christ is the surest window into \nthe heart of God. When\u0014\n                      Martin Luther was asked difficult questions \nsuch as the one posed\u0014\n                      here, he replied by encouraging his troubled \nfriends to \"look to the\u0014\n                      wounds of Jesus.\" That same advice had been \ngiven to him as a young\u0014\n                      man, when, plagued by guilt, he doubted whether \nhe could ever be\u0014\n                      accepted by a holy God. By focusing on Christ, \nhe discovered the\u0014\n                      doctrine of justification by faith alone. In \nJesus Christ, God's grace and\u0014\n                      truth were realized in perfect equipoise. In \nJesus we see that God is\u0014\n                      unspeakably generous, \"abundant in goodness and \ntruth\" (Ex. 34:6,\u0014\n                      KJV), and at the same time a God of \nuncompromised purity and\u0014\n                      righteousness. In Jesus Christ the Creator has \nbecome our Redeemer,\u0014\n                      the Judge has received our judgment. Through \nhis death and\u0014\n                      resurrection, the way to eternal life has been \nforever opened to all who\u0014\n                      turn from selfishness and sin and in simple \ntrust commit themselves to\u0014\n                      Christ for all time and eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Timothy George, a CT executive editor, is dean \nof Beeson Divinity School\u0014\n                      at Samford University in Birmingham.\u0014",

Scripture, however, seems to show that one \naspect of human dignity is that we are built to last. Whether for joy \nor for sorrow, our souls are eternal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, Scripture and good biblical theology indicate that none will \nbe in hell who did not effectively choose it by following in the \nfootsteps of Adam and preferring their own way to God's. In some \nfashion, God reveals himself and his will to everyone, and everyone \nresponds in one way or another (see Rom. 1:182:16). But nonbelievers \nuniversally make the anti-God choice, and hell is God giving people \nwhat they chose. That is realityretributive realityand an abiding \nconsequence of following our heart and doing what we want to do; I \nwish I could persuade more people to face this seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow pose the question in its toughest form. Imagine a believing \nspouse or parent who loved, prayed for, and agonized over a dear one \nwho resisted the gospel and died suddenly in an accident. There are \nno grounds for thinking that this or any other memory will be erased \nin heaven. So how can it not keep the bereaved one from heaven's \ntotal joy?\u0014\n\u0014\nSignificantly, this is not a Bible problem; instead, Scripture rules \nout all thought of it ever becoming anyone's problem. For it tells us \nthat God the Father (who now pleads with mankind to accept the \nreconciliation that Christ's death secured for all) and God the Son \n(our appointed Judge, who wept over Jerusalem) will in a final \njudgment express \"wrath\" and administer justice against rebellious \nhumans. God's holy righteousness will hereby be revealed; God will be \ndoing the right thing, vindicating himself at last against all who \nhave defied him, and there is no hint that this hurts the Judge more \nthan it hurts the sinner. (Read through Matt. 25; John 5:2229; Rom. \n2:516, 12:19; 2 Thess. 1:79; Rev. 18:119:3, 20:1135, and you will \nsee that clearly.) God will judge justly, and all angels, saints, and \nmartyrs will praise him for it. So it seems inescapable that we \nshall, with them, approve the judgment of personsrebelswhom we have \nknown and loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat sounds appalling; how can it be? Remember, in heaven our minds, \nhearts, motives, and feelings will be sanctified, so that we are \nfully conformed to the character and outlook of Jesus our Lord. This \nwill happen at or before our bodily resurrection. How we shall then \nthink and feel is really beyond our knowing, just as a chrysalis \ncould not know what it feels like to be a butterfly till it becomes \none.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut certainly the promise that God will wipe away every tear from \nbelievers' eyes (Rev. 7:17) will find its fulfillment as one aspect \nof this transformation. In heaven, glorifying God and thanking him \nfor everything will always absorb us. All our love for and joy in \nothers who are with us in heaven will spring from their doing the \nsame, and love and pity for hell's occupants will not enter our \nhearts. Their hell will not veto our heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nGranted, this sounds to us more like hard-heartedness than \nChristlikeness, yet Christlikeness is precisely what it will be. Our \ndifficulty is that we cannot now conceive the heavenly condition in a \nfull way.\u0014\n\u0014\nWrote Richard Baxter: \"My knowledge of that life is small, / The eye \nof faith is dim; / But it's enough that Christ knows all, / And I \nshall be with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.I. Packer is an executive editor of CT and a professor of theology \nat Regent College in Vancouver.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "HOLY SCRIPTURE, REVELATION, INSPIRATION, &  INTERPRETATION",
    "words": "Holy Scripture: revelation, inspiration and \ninterpretation\u0014\n                     (Carlisle: Paternoster / Downers Grove: \nInterVarsity Press, 1994)\u0014\n\u0014\n Holy Scripture is the second volume in a new systematic theology \nseries, Christian Foundations, being published by\u0014\nDonald Bloesch, emeritus professor of theology at the University of \nDubuque Theological Seminary. (For the first, A\u0014\nTheology of Word and Spirit, see ERT 17:4 October 1993, 509-512). In \ntackling critical elements of the doctrine of\u0014\nScripture in this expanded form, Bloesch consolidates and refines his \nposition as expressed in earlier writings,\u0014\nespecially Essentials of Evangelical Theology. Expounding his \ndistinctive \"progressive evangelicalism\", his main\u0014\nconcern is to steer between two equally unacceptable and increasingly \npolarised options. On the one hand, there is\u0014\na rationalistic biblicism which treats Scripture as if it were a \nlegalistic text or even an oracle; on the other, a\u0014\n\"latitudinarianism that plays fast and loose with the biblical \ntexts\". Bloeschs preference is for a view which sees\u0014\nScripture as the written Word of God which is \"by virtue of its \ndivine inspiration a reliable witness to the truth revealed\u0014\nby God in Jesus Christ.\" However, \"it becomes the living Word when it \nactually communicates to us the truth and\u0014\npower of the cross of Christ through the illumination of the Spirit.\".\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first part of the book sets the topic in its contemporary \nscholarly and church context with emphasis on \"the crisis\u0014\nin biblical authority,\" and then proceeds to as detailed discussion \nof revelation and inspiration. Bloesch rightly sees\u0014\nthe approach to Scripture as crucial for all other theological \nissues. Although he holds a high view of Scripture and its\u0014\nauthority, he rejects the idea that the Word of God can be identified \nsimply with the text of the Bible. Instead, he sees\u0014\nit as a \"mediate source of divine revelation\"; the \"ultimate source \nis the living Christ, who speaks to us by his Spirit.\"\u0014\nFollowing on the theme of his earlier volume, Bloesch affirms \"the \nparadoxical unity of Word and Spirit so that the\u0014\nreception of the Word is both a rational apprehension and a redeeming \nexperience.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBloeschs comprehensive approach is seen a chapter on tradition in \nwhich he discusses the complex relationship\u0014\nbetween Scripture and the church, including tradition, canon and the \nrole of the believing community for the proper\u0014\nreception of the power of Scripture as the Word of God. He affirms \nthe need to recognize that \"church tradition is not\u0014\nthe container of the truth of the gospel but the sign and witness of \nthe forward movement of this truth in history.\"\u0014\nHowever, he warns that the gospel is \"imparted in such a way that it \nis never our possession but always our goal and\u0014\nhope.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second half of the book, which is more tightly constructed than \nthe first, turns to the important issue of\u0014\nhermeneutics. A general discussion of the topic is followed by a \nchapter devoted entirely to \"Rudolf Bultmann: An\u0014\nEnduring Presence.\" Bloesch regards Bultmann as one of the most \ninfluential figures of the twentieth century in\u0014\nregard to biblical studies and especially hermeneutical issues. This \njudgement is reinforced in the concluding\u0014\nchapters on the Bible and myth, and biblical and philosophical \nperspectives on truth. Bloesch recognizes that the\u0014\nBible contains various literary forms, some of which may be described \nas \"mythopoetical\" by which he means an\u0014\n\"imagistic language describing the dramatic interaction between \ndivinity and humanity . . . that cannot be captured in\u0014\nliteral or univocal language.\" However, this does not imply that the \n\"reality that this language describes is\u0014\nmythological\" and nor does it limit the ability of Scripture to \nconvey the truth of Gods word. Nevertheless, Bloesch\u0014\nasserts that the forms must be taken seriously since we only have \naccess to the Word in its literary form. But the\u0014\n\"transformative and informative\" truth of Gods Word is to be found \nin obedient faith rather than in assent to some\u0014\nrationalistic concepts or being caught up in some moral or mystical \nexperience. \u0014\n\u0014\nBloeschs dependence on key mentors such as Barth and P.T. Forsyth is \nonce again clearly apparent, as are his\u0014\nskilful presentations of insights from historical theology and his \ncreative integration of theological insights with\u0014\nspiritual realities. Similarly, crucial interpretative concepts such \nas paradox and Christological gospel-centred\u0014\nhermeneutics are used extensively. Bloesch devotes special attention, \n(sometimes in appendices attached to the\u0014\nrelevant chapters), to topical issues such as theological method, \ninerrancy, narrative theology and the status of the\u0014\nApocrypha. These, and discussions of some prominent evangelical \npositions, together with extensive documentation,\u0014\ncombine to make this volume an important point of reference for the \nthinking of one of evangelicalisms most\u0014\nrespected senior theologians.\u0014",

Whether the lash, or \nexile from one's\u0014\n                      homeland, or a stretch on the rack, or exposure \nto public shame (The\u0014\n                      Scarlet Letter), or confinement in jailor even \nthe\u0014\n                      noosepunishment is expected.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Is there a Christian principle from which \nretributive justice is derived?\u0014\n                      Retributive justice did not arise from any \nChristian principle; almost\u0014\n                      every pre-Christian society dealt with \nwrongdoers by causing them\u0014\n                      pain. Even so, retributive justice is supported \nby biblical example.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In ancient Israel, God's commandments were the \nlaw of the land.\u0014\n                      Therefore, all wrongdoing (violating God's law) \nwas a criminal offense\u0014\n                      for which the wrongdoers paid a penalty, often \na shockingly steep one\u0014\n                      such as stoning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though it brings the good news of grace to \nsinners, the New\u0014\n                      Testament does not disavow the Old Testament \nway of punishing\u0014\n                      wrongdoers. The apostle Paul insists (Rom. 13) \nthat God invested the\u0014\n                      state with a sword. And what is a sword for but \nto kill or to cause\u0014\n                      pain? Jesus said that we should render to the \nstate what properly\u0014\n                      belongs to the state, and though he had taxes \nin mind, we might\u0014\n                      reasonably infer that giving the state the job \nof punishing wrongdoers\u0014\n                      is one way of giving the state its due.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus implieddid he not?that God gave Pilate \nthe authority to\u0014\n                      execute wrongdoers, even when, as in Jesus' own \ncase, he had an\u0014\n                      innocent person on his hands. It seems, then, \nthat the New\u0014\n                      Testament grants the state the right to punish \nwrongdoers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even the cross of Christ seems to support \nretributive justicethat is\u0014\n                      certainly implied in the doctrine of \nsubstitutionary atonement. At the\u0014\n                      cross, God was punishing Jesus for the sins of \nthe world. God's\u0014\n                      justice required a penalty from sinners and, in \nhis unspeakable love,\u0014\n                      he paid the penalty himself in the person of \nhis crucified Son.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This, in brief, seems to be the kind of \nbiblical insight that lies behind\u0014\n                      the conviction that the state's task is to make \nwrongdoers suffer a fair\u0014\n                      penalty.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The matter gets sticky, however, when we ask \npractical questions\u0014\n                      about the state's competence to punish justly. \nThere are no objective\u0014\n                      standards for measuring the amount of pain that \nwill match the\u0014\n                      offense. How to measure the pain of falsifying \nrecords to deceive\u0014\n                      shareholders of an Enron?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What is more, our justice system works so badly \nthat, for too many\u0014\n                      citizens, it serves neither justice nor reform. \nLocking violators\u0014\n                      (especially young ones) in our overcrowded \nprisons almost\u0014\n                      guarantees that they will come out worse than \nwhen they went in.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Restorative justice may be the \"more excellent \nway.\" Restorative\u0014\n                      justice is not a replacement of retributive \njustice, but a complement. It\u0014\n                      seeks the rehabilitation of the wrongdoer and \nthe repair of the victim's\u0014\n                      injury. The model for restorative justice may \nbe the way that the\u0014\n                      apostle Paul urged on the Galatian church: \"If \na man be overtaken in\u0014\n                      a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a \none in a spirit of\u0014\n                      meekness\" (Gal. 6:1).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the way he conducted South Africa's Truth \nand Reconciliation\u0014\n                      Commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu \ndemonstrated how\u0014\n                      restorative justice can work when a just \nretribution is all but\u0014\n                      impossible to achieveand when punishment would \ncause double\u0014\n                      damage if it were attempted. The wrongdoers \npaid the heavy penalty\u0014\n                      of facing the truth. Their victims paid the \nprice of extending\u0014\n                      forgiveness. Andto an extent we cannot \nmeasurethe truthful\u0014\n                      wrongdoers were restored and the victims were \nsatisfied.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We need jurists who have a passion for \nreconciliation as well as a\u0014\n                      respect for punishment.

    "title": "HITLER, IT SEEMS, LOVED MONEY AND DIED RICH",
    "words": "Hitler, It Seems, Loved Money and Died Rich\u0014\nBy STEVEN ERLANGER\u0014\n\u0014\nBERLIN, Aug. 7  Hitler died wealthy. \u0014\nAccording to a new German television documentary, Hitler liked money, \nboth for the luxuries it bought him and the loyalties it ensured, and \nhe amassed a lot of it. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn all the continuing fascination with Hitler since his suicide on \nApril 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker as the Soviet Army closed in, \nlittle attention has been paid, until now, to his personal finances.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbstemious in his public image, Hitler liked to live grandly. He paid \nmuch attention to his income from his own writing and from the \ncopyright fees for his photographs, said Ingo Helm, a 47-year-old \nfreelance journalist and filmmaker, who spent over a year making \n\"Hitler's Money,\" which will be shown later this month on a \nstate-owned station, ARD. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hitler saw himself as an unrecognized genius, and in order to change \nthis situation he was very interested in power, money and social \nadvancement,\" Mr. Helm said in an interview today, after word of his \nfilm was made public in German media. \"All this was balsam for the \ntortured soul of the unrecognized genius.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler himself described at great length his poverty and hardship as \na struggling artist in Vienna before World War I, although he had a \nsmall inheritance. His poverty embarrassed him deeply. In \"Mein \nKampf,\" from which he would make millions, he emphasized the hard \nstruggle for existence of the \"upstart\" who had risen \"by his own \nefforts from his previous position in life to a higher one,\" that \n\"kills all pity\" and destroys \"feeling for the misery of those who \nhave remained behind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the historian Ian Kershaw notes, such feelings put \"into context \nhis professed interest in `the social question' while he was in \nVienna,\" which turned into a search for scapegoats to explain his own \ndestitution and social decline. It may also help explain Hitler's \naffection for wealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Hitler also spent millions, in lavish gifts and payments, to buy \nthe loyalty of politicians and businessmen and to keep them dependent \non him, Mr. Helm said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Influenced by his propaganda, I thought of Hitler as someone who \nwasn't selfish,\" Mr. Helm said. \"I knew he was a criminal but it \nsurprised me to know that he was rich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, Hitler's property and assets, including a house in \nMunich he had built for Eva Braun, were given to the state of Bavaria \nby the Allied Control Commission. He had no children.\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler made few distinctions between his own money and that of the \nNazi Party and even the state, Mr. Helm said, adding, \"It was all \nmixed together.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the development of his summer residence at Obersalzberg, above \nBerchtesgaden in Bavaria, or in the development of his own art \ncollection, Hitler freely used state funds. Nor did he pay taxes on \nhis income or his property, meaning that there was no overall \naccounting of his worth.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of his fortune came from royalties earned on \"Mein Kampf,\" his \nbest-selling autobiography and political tract, which is still banned \nin Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut during his time as German leader, every couple who married were \ngiven a copy of \"Mein Kampf\" by their local community  which had to \nbuy the book from the publisher.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Mr. Helm, Hitler earned some 7.8 million reichsmarks \nfrom the book alone. It is hard to give a precise value in today's \ncurrency, but the reichsmarks would be worth some $5 to $8 today, Mr. \nHelm said  a tidy sum.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, Hitler's friend and photographer Heinrich Aaffmann  in \nwhose shop Hitler first met Eva Braun, whom he married just before \ndying  had the sole copyright on official portraits of Hitler, which \nwere used in government offices and on postage stamps.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Helm says he cannot prove that Hitler got a kickback on those \nroyalties, but believes so. Original law limited the duration of \ncopyright to 10 years, but Hitler personally authorized an extension \nof copyright to 25 years on what Aaffmann called his \"photographic \nartwork\" of the fhrer. \"Hitler probably had a share in that income,\" \nMr. Helm said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler also benefited hugely from contributions made by individual \nbusinessmen and the corporations themselves  much more after he came \nto power than before. \"He wasn't simply created by big business,\" Mr. \nHelm said. \"Once he was in power, big business was opportunistic,\" \ncontributing large sums to what was known as \"the Adolf Hitler \nDonation of German Industry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the time he became chancellor until his death in 1945, Hitler \nreceived some 700 million reichsmarks in corporate payments, Mr. Helm \nsaid  well over $3 billion. In return, the businessmen made millions \nmore on their investments and their war work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were also special funds from the state budget to which only \nHitler and his close associates had access.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to new research that comes to light in Mr. \nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaijbdiltpaaaaipwhaq'm..daaaa-t/bafebvaabf0aaaa film, \nHitler invested at least two million reichsmarks of his own money to \naccelerate the secret reconstruction of a palace in what is now \nPoznan, in Poland, for another fhrer residence. The palace had been \noriginally built by Kaiser Wilhelm II, and by 1945 at least 20 \nmillion reichsmarks had been spent on the project.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Hitler died without immediate heirs, his late \nhalf-sisdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaqscgqwg0aaaa/z, \nAngela Raubal, had children, and there are other descendants of his \nmother, who live in the Waldviertel region of northern Austria. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe heirs had asked Werner Maser, a popular German historian of the \nNazi period, to look into their rights. In particular, the heirs \nargued that copyright cannot be expropriated in the way physical \nproperty can. They wanted the royalty income.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the heirs disagreed among themselves, Mr. Helm said, and no \nlawsuit to obtain the royalties was filed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hitler phenomenon remains a source of fascination, prompting a \nsmall industry in histories of the period, let alone thrillers and \nmovies.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost embarrassingly, in 1983, the magazine Stern fell for a set of \nfabricated diaries supposedly written by Hitler and paid about 10 \nmillion marks (some $5 million), through a reporter named Gerd \nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakkya''.daaaa't/baugdh0aaaq/z, \nto a forger named Konrad Kujau. Stern also sold the rights to \nNewsweek and The Sunday Times of London.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, there was another flurry of attention, this time to a more \nserious work of history trying to make the case that Hitler was gay. \nThe book, \"The Hidden Hitler,\" by Lothar Machtan, suggests that \nHitler ordered the killing of several high-ranking Nazis to protect \nhis secret, including Ernst Rhm, the head of the Sturmabteilung, or \nBrownshirts. \u0014\nRhm was gay, and Mr. Machtan writes that he tried to blackmail \nHitler by threatening to reveal his sexuality, one reason that Hitler \nsupposedly ordered \"the night of the long knives\" in 1934, when he \npurged more than 100 of his most embarrassing and threatening \nfollowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the Nazi persecution of gay men, many of whom were sent to \nconcentration camps, was a function of Hitler's self-hatred and \neffort to disguise his own sexual preferences, Mr. Machtan argues.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE EARLY CHURCH SAW HEAVEN",
    "words": "HOW THE EARLY CHURCH SAW HEAVEN\u0014\nThe first Christians had very specific ideas about who they would\u0014\nmeet in the afterlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Chris Armstrong\u0014\n\u0014\n   As this week's Newsweek cover article insists, \"heaven\" is a\u0014\n   powerful and pervasive word. It has been used to motivate\u0014\n   people of many faiths in many ways: To instill character and\u0014\n   strengthen resolve. To build community and spur change. To\u0014\n   steel terrorists and comfort victims. It is easy to imagine\u0014\n   this word, as the writers of the Newsweek article do, on the\u0014\n   lips of both the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 and\u0014\n   many of the passengers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Apparently, although ministers in mainline Christian churches\u0014\n   in America don't preach much about heaven, 75 percent of\u0014\n   Americans believe they'll go there -- if they're good.\u0014\n   Evangelicals talk more about the subject, believing that only\u0014\n   faith in Christ can put them on the \"highway to heaven.\" And\u0014\n   most folks expect that once through the gates, they will see\u0014\n   not only their Lord, but also their loved ones (for some,\u0014\n   including their pets).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   For thoughtful Christians, all of this raises the question,\u0014\n   \"What did the early church believe about heaven?\" The answer\u0014\n   draws together both divine communion and human reunion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   For the apostles, heaven-as-divine-communion was a given.\u0014\n   Indeed, in the New Testament the word \"heaven\" is often used\u0014\n   to stand for God himself (Luke 15:21; Matt. 21:25, 23:22; John\u0014\n   3:27).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   But heaven was a place, too. As Jesus had promised, \"I go to\u0014\n   prepare a place for you ... that where I am you may be also\"\u0014\n   (John 14:3-4). And this place was not simple, but rather a\u0014\n   complicated space with rooms or levels (an idea the great\u0014\n   Italian poet Dante Alighieri would expand upon to\u0014\n   unforgettable effect over a millennium later). In 2\u0014\n   Corinthians 12:2-4, the Apostle Paul pulls perhaps the biggest\u0014\n   tease of the Bible when he tells of being lifted up into \"the\u0014\n   third heaven,\" where he experienced \"things so astounding\"\u0014\n   that, to the great disappointment of his readers ever since,\u0014\n   \"they cannot be told\" (New Living Bible).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Not only was heaven a place, it was populated. Especially\u0014\n   during the centuries of Roman persecution, Christians looked\u0014\n   forward to communing with God AND with each other.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   The earliest evidence of this trend is The Martyrdom of\u0014\n   Perpetua and Felicity, an account of two Christian women\u0014\n   killed in Carthage (in North Africa) around 202 or 203. This\u0014\n   book records a dream Perpetua had in prison just before she\u0014\n   and her companions were thrown to the wild beasts. In the\u0014\n   dream Perpetua saw her sickly brother, Dinocrates, who had\u0014\n   died at the age of 7, in heaven drinking from the fountain of\u0014\n   life. In the same book, other soon-to-be-martyred Roman\u0014\n   captives envisioned themselves after death joyously rejoining\u0014\n   their fellow martyrs in a garden paradise.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Martyrdom was a widely circulated book, and it may well\u0014\n   have shaped many early Christians' visions of their eternal\u0014\n   reward. For example, we find communal images of heaven -- as\u0014\n   banquet and as playground for Christian children -- depicted\u0014\n   on the walls of the Christians' catacomb hideouts beneath\u0014\n   Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Such pictures of heavenly human fellowship, however, didn't \u0014\n   push God from the center of the picture. Clement of \u0014\n   Alexandria, one of the earliest Church Fathers, said in the \u0014\n   second century that heaven was above all the place where \u0014\n   believers received the vision of God from Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Indeed, by the year 400, with the era of persecution ended,\u0014\n   the communal and sensual aspects of heaven seemed to recede as\u0014\n   God himself took center stage again. Christian leaders wrote\u0014\n   increasingly of heaven as, above all, the place where one\u0014\n   participated in God's spiritual perfection. For the fourth-\u0014\n   century Eastern Father Gregory of Nazianzus, heaven was where\u0014\n   the tired pilgrim could finally rest in God. There the\u0014\n   Christian could at last, released from the distractions of the\u0014\n   flesh, enjoy the full nearness of Christ-tasted only briefly\u0014\n   and tantalizingly on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Augustine of Hippo (354-430) painted his vision of heaven in\u0014\n   the great City of God. He wrote the book as humanity's highest\u0014\n   societal achievement, the Roman Empire, tottered on the brink\u0014\n   of dissolution. Against this backdrop he turned his eyes\u0014\n   upward to a kingdom whose splendor far surpassed that of the\u0014\n   world beneath. In his Confessions, Augustine had insisted that\u0014\n   \"our heart does not rest until it rests in God.\" Now he\u0014\n   painted heaven as one long embrace -- an embrace of God, and\u0014\n   an embrace of other people who love Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Treasuring this vision of eternal communion and community,\u0014\n   Christians ever since have looked forward to a time and a\u0014\n   place where \"the young women will dance for joy, and the men --\u0014\n   old and young -- will join in the celebration.\" So said\u0014\n   Jeremiah, the \"weeping prophet,\" who though he lived before\u0014\n   the word \"heaven\" was first spoken, still insisted that he\u0014\n   heard God say \"I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow\u0014\n   for rejoicing.\" (Jer. 31:13, New Living Bible)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   *This article draws from Colleen McDannell and Bernhard Lang's\u0014\n   Heaven: A History and Everett Ferguson's Encyclopedia of Early\u0014\n   Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   *For more on early Christians' visions of heaven, see\u0014\n   http://ChristianityToday.com/ch/2001/002/11.38.html.\u0014",

    "title": "HOOKED ON A CROOKED BOOK",
    "words": "Hooked on a crooked book\u0014\nAn antisemitic fraud born a century ago wins new converts \u0014\n\u0014\nBY NOAM NEUSNER US News and World Report, 9/2/02\u0014\n\u0014\nLast summer, a front-page column in the state-run Egyptian newspaper \nAl-Ahram revealed a Jewish plot to destroy Islam and Christianity. \nRadio Islam, a Web site run by a failed Moroccan revolutionary, has \n24 chapters on the plot, along with photos of \"Jews who run America\" \n(including Madeleine Albright, raised Catholic but with Jewish \nroots). The charter of Palestinian terror group Hamas cites the plot \nas well: \"With their money [Jews] formed secret societies . . . in \ndifferent parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies \nand achieving Zionist interests.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what's the evidence for this conspiracy? The Protocols of the \nElders of Zion.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtocols and used them as the basis for articles later collected as \nThe International Jew. Adolf Hitler said the book \"shocked\" him, and \nhe resolved to \"strike at the Jews with their own weapons.\" Even \ntoday, Protocols remains in wide circulation (it can be purchased \nfrom major online booksellers) and has been translated into dozens of \nlanguages.\u0014\n\u0014\nCzar Nicholas II is the man behind the forgery. About 100 years ago, \nhis Russian secret police created the work to discredit the monarch's \nBolshevik enemies, many of whom happened to be Jewish. The book, \nwhich echoes whole parts of a French parody written three decades \nearlier, portrays a cabal of unnamed Jews bent on global domination.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlame game. It took more than a decade for political allies of the \nRussian monarchy to popularize the 1903 text, and it wasn't until a \nGerman publisher translated and distributed it that it became \nembraced as truth by millions. \"When it comes to conspiracies, Jews \nhave always been at the top of the hit parade,\" says Abraham Foxman, \nnational director of the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors \nantisemitism and bigotry. This hatred had reached a boiling point in \nthe 19th century, when war, economic depression, and the onset of \nmodern ideas and institutionsthe nation-state, universities, \nsocialism, capitalism overthrew monarchies and aristocracies and \npushed the power of the clergy to the periphery.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Europeans of that age, the Protocols provided an organizing \nprinciple for the rapid changes: Jews were behind it. \"The Protocols \nserved an explanatory function [of] how bad things happen,\" says \nStephen Bronner, author of A Rumor About the Jews, a history of the \nProtocols. \"It really spoke to the mainstream.\" Particularly in the \nperiod between the world wars, the thesis of a Jewish conspiracy to \ncontrol banking, arms, political power, and culture gained currency \nin Germany. While most historians do not think the Protocols led \ndirectly to the Holocaust, they say it clearly hardened the views of \nmany Europeans. Victor Marsden, whose 1922 English translation of the \nProtocols is still widely used, offered this uncanny observation in \nhis introduction: \"The Jews are now a world menace and . . . the \nAryan races will have to domicile them permanently out of Europe.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Holocaust gave lie to the central thesis of the \nProtocolsnamely, that Jews would wreak horrors upon the worldthe \nhoax continued. To Stalin, the book proved the need to rout Jews out \nof respected positions in the Communist Party. The creation of the \nstate of Israel in 1948 was seen as part of the plot (although the \nProtocols doesn't mention Zionism or Palestine), and, in a twist, \nconspiracists argued that the Holocaust itself was a hoax meant to \ndrum up support for the Zionist dream.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Arab world has had the Protocols since 1920, but not until \nIsrael's establishment, and its success in several wars, was the book \nwidely distributed. \"One might imagine people rationalizing a series \nof unending humiliations at the hands of Israel by saying, 'The Jews, \nthey must run the world,' \" says Michael Hudson, a professor of Arab \nstudies at Georgetown University. Each time truth breaks down the \nfraud behind the Protocols, believers in the Arab world and elsewhere \nhave a simple explanation: When you're dealing with a secret plot to \nrule the world, what would you expect but denials?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis entire issues was devoted to hoaxes.\u0014",

    "title": "HENLEE BARNETTE: GIANT IN THE LAND",
    "words": "Henlee Barnette: Giant in the Land \u0014\nBY Ron Sisk \u0014\nInto his 10th decade now, Baptist ethicist, author and preacher \nHenlee Barnette continues his unflinching call to Christian integrity \nin thought and action. His career spans seven decades of Baptist \nhistory in the South. From the time of his conversion as a teen-ager \nfrom the cotton mills of Kannapolis, N.C., Barnette has brought to \nthe task of ethics both his strong biblical faith and his willingness \nto examine honestly any issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis career as an activist began with a seminary chapel at Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, and a call by the Baptist \nprophet Clarence Jordan to minister to Louisville's Haymarket \ndistrict of flophouses, tenements and bordellos. With Walter \nRauschenbusch's social gospel as a guiding light, Barnette spent \nyears as pastor and friend to that blighted neighborhood, earning the \nnickname \"Bishop of the Haymarket.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Baptist professor of religion in the '40s, he found himself \nconfronted with the quintessential Southern issue of racism. In the \nactivist spirit that would characterize all his work, he began to \nsearch for things he could practically do. While a professor at \nHoward College (Samford University), he was instrumental in founding \nthe Interracial Ministerial Association in Birmingham. After \nreturning to Southern as professor of Christian ethics, Barnette \nmarched for fair housing in the city of Louisville and invited the \nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to campus. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe has always been in trouble. Friends long ago gave him a pair of \nasbestos gloves to use in opening his mail from outraged Baptists. In \nevery issue though, Barnette searches for a way to bring the biblical \nprinciple of love to bear in concrete ways. He describes himself as \nan SCO, a \"selective conscientious objector.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I reserve the right,\" he says, \"to decide which wars I will support \nand which I will not.\"\u0014\nDuring the Vietnam conflict, he found himself forced to re-examine \nhis convictions in a particularly personal way. Of his two young \nadult sons, one became a bomber pilot in Vietnam and the other fled \nto Sweden as a conscientious objector. Asked which of his sons he \nsupported, Barnette always replied, \"I support them both. Each is \ndoing what his conscience under God leads him to do.\" No father, he \nbelieved, could ask for more.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with his second wife, the late Helen Poarch Barnette, he \nchampioned the role of women in Baptist life. Describing their \nmarriage as a \"coarchy\"--a partnership of equals--Barnette found \nample biblical evidence for the freedom of Christian women to assert \nboth relational and spiritual equality with men. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn accomplished author, Barnette has always written about ethics with \na Southern Baptist audience in mind. His text Introducing Christian \nEthics served for many years as a standard for those taking their \nfirst venture into the field. From ecology in the '70s to biomedical \nethics in the '80s and '90s, he applied his voracious curiosity to \nresearching and writing on ethical topics.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis method is both simple and sophisticated. He seeks the best \npossible scientific input. He never flinches from the facts. As an \nacademician his first task is to understand. But then, as a \ntheologian, he searches for and applies relevant biblical principles. \nAnd as an activist Christian he seeks the leadership of the Holy \nSpirit to discover what can actually be done.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften he's paid a price for his candor. Retired at age 65 by a \nseminary administration weary of his ethical forthrightness, Barnette \nfound a home in the University of Louisville Medical School where he \ncontinued and expanded his research in biomedical ethics. Later \nbrought back into favor at the seminary by a friendlier \nadministration, and then once again alienated by the fundamentalist \ntakeover, Barnette never missed a beat.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, he continues his work from the same little white house next \ndoor to the seminary where he raised four children and generations of \nconservative hackles. His ethical interests remain catholic in their \ninclusivity. He maintains a lively interest in local and national \npolitics. His letters to the editor, often about the evils of \nfundamentalism, appear frequently in Kentucky Baptists' Western \nRecorder. \u0014\nAt noon on the first Thursday of every month he hosts a luncheon \ncalled \"Barnette's Buddies,\" where Louisvillians gather to discuss \ntopics of interest in Baptist life and beyond. In an article written \nfor Baptists Today just this summer, Barnette dealt with the issue of \na Christian response to terrorism. \"Outthink them!\" and \"Outlove \nthem!\" were two of his pithy and salient conclusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a graduate student at Southern in the early '80s, I wrote a \ndissertation on the career and ethical method of Henlee Barnette. I \nsought to sum up and characterize his work. Silly me. I seem to have \nbeen at least a quarter of a century too early. But I can say this: \nAs long as we have Henlee Barnette among us, faithful Baptists have \nan articulate advocate and friend. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe need not fear those who would force us into an intellectual or \nethical box. We have a giant in the land. \u0014\n\u0014\nRon Sisk is professor of homiletics and Christian ministry at North \nAmerican Baptist Seminary in Sioux Falls, S.D.\u0014",

He \nhad achieved the German army's highest rank and earned the respect of \nboth his countrymen and his opponents; the British who fought against \nRommel dubbed him the \"Desert Fox.\" Within two years, however, the \nGerman leadership had come to view him as a traitor.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs early as the fall of 1943, Rommel began to believe that Germany \ncould not win the war--a dangerous sentiment in the Third Reich. By \nthe time the Allies invaded France in June 1944, Rommel was convinced \ndefeat was at hand and implored Hitler to end the war, to no avail.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 20, Hitler survived the explosion of a bomb planted in his \nconference room, and set out to purge his ranks of anyone who might \nwant him dead. Rommel was known to be friendly with some of the army \nofficers under suspicion, and fellow generals, jealous of Rommel's \nstatus, denounced him.\u0014\n\u0014\nRommel told his wife he was not involved, and no proof has ever been \nuncovered linking him with the assassination attempt. It also seems \nunlikely considering that Rommel appeared unwilling to kill anyone \nexcept in battle; on more than one occasion, he disobeyed Hitler's \norders to execute prisoners. Nevertheless, his defeatism sealed his \nfate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nazis gave Rommel a choice: a state trial (which would certainly \nend in dishonor, conviction, and execution) or suicide (which would \nbe followed by a state funeral and protection for his family). On \nOctober 14, the Desert Fox sat in the back seat of a staff car and \ndrank poison. He was then given a hero's funeral--because he was \nstill more valuable to the Nazis as a dead hero than a dead traitor.\u0014",

    "title": "HYPOCRISY",
    "words": "I thought this text about hypocrisy was appropriate. I am reminded of \na story about Theodore Roosevelt. During one of his political \ncampaigns, a delegation called on him at his home in Oyster Bay, Long \nIsland. The President met them with his coat off and his sleeves \nrolled up. \"Ah, gentlemen,\" he said, \"come down to the barn and we \nwill talk while I do some work.\" At the barn, Roosevelt picked up a \npitchfork and looked around for the hay. Then he called out, \"John, \nwhere's all the hay?\" \"Sorry, sir,\" John called down from the \nhayloft. \"I ain't had time to toss it back down again after you \npitched it up while the Iowa folks were here.\" \u0014\n=============================\u0014\nJesus' Criticisms Here is a list of Jesus' criticisms about religious \nleadership in his day: They did not practice what they taught \n(hypocrisy). They put heavy burdens on others but not themselves \n(legalism). They sought and loved public recognition (pride). Status, \nrespect and titles were important to them (arrogance). They locked \npeople out of the kingdom (judgmental). They established laws to \nbenefit themselves (greed). They neglected to emphasize justice and \nmercy (bias). They were accomplices to silencing the prophets \n(oppressive). \u0014\n==============================\u0014\nIf you read 1 Maccabees in the Apocrypha, you understand the \nhistorical origins of the Sadducees and the Pharisees. The Sadducees \nwere modernists who saw much value in Greek philosophy. They were \nmaterialists who did not believe in angels or demons; they did not \nbelieve in an afterlife, let alone a resurrection or a judgment; they \ndid not look for a Messiah, and they believed that the Law had to be \nadapted to modern times and the current state of knowledge. For this \nreason, we find Jesus very often as a guest in a Pharisee's dinner \nparty, but we never see him hanging out with Sadducees. (Bear in mind \nthat Pharisees would not socialize with anyone outside their party.) \nMost of Jesus' followers, for example Paul, came from the Pharisees. \nThe New Testament does not record a single Sadducee converting to \nJesus' cause. That is why Jesus tells the people that the Pharisees \nare good teachers but bad examples. \u0014\n===================================\u0014\nThe words of Shakespeare come to mind: This above all, to thine own \nself be true, and it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not \nthen be false to any man. In Hamlet, Polonius giving advice to \nLaertes. \u0014\n===================================\u0014\nA man, returning from a business trip, was met at the airport by his \nwife. They walked from the gate together and were standing waiting \nfor the baggage to be unloaded. An extremely attractive stewardess \nwalked by. Suddenly, the man came to life. Beaming, he said to the \nstewardess, \"I hope we can fly together again, Miss Jones.\" On the \nway home his grew suspicious, \"How come you knew the name of that \nstewardess?\" she asked. The man replied smoothly, \"You see, my dear, \nher name was posted right up front in the plane, under the names of \nthe pilot and co-pilot.\" To which the wife replied, \"Okay, now give \nme the names of the pilot and co-pilot.\" The man's hypocrisy was \nuncovered. \u0014\n=================================\u0014\nThe Young Seminarian\u0014\n A young seminary graduate came up to the lectern, very \nself-confident and immaculately dressed. \u0014\nHe began to deliver his first sermon in his first church and the \nwords simply would not come out. Finally he burst into tears and \nended up leaving the platform obviously humbled.\u0014\n There were two older ladies sitting in the front row and one \nremarked to the other, \"If he'd come in like he went out, he would \nhave gone out like he came in.\" \u0014\nJesus calls us to a real trust in God and to humble service in his \nchurch and world. The temptation is ever before us to exalt ourselves \n- to impress others, to make a name for ourselves. That was not how \nJesus came, nor was it why he came. \u0014\nPeter J. Blackburn, Sermon: \"Humble Before God\"\u0014\n========================================\u0014\nThe danger of pride is that it feeds on goodness. \u0014\n===============================\u0014\nA local church asked members to donate money for a new building. The \nbuilding committee made one stipulation: no plaques or recognition of \nany kind would be placed in the building to honor the givers. The \nresponse was mediocre at best. When the committee withdrew their \nrequirement and allowed for a memorial registry with a listing of \ndonors, the building was easily subscribed. What had changed? At \nfirst, the building committee was appealing solely to people's \ncharity and generosity. Later, they offered an appeal to their egos, \nand the egos won.

    "words": "Have You Taken Inventory \nLately?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe renown teacher and author Dr. David McLennon tells a story of his \nvery\u0014\nfirst job in a small town general store. This was the day before \nmails and\u0014\nsupermarket chains at least it was in his community. At age thirteen \nhe was\u0014\nhired as a handy boy. He would sweep the flour, bag items for \ncustomers, put\u0014\nup stock. On one particular Saturday, he recalled., he heard the \nowner say\u0014\nto one of the clerks \"It's that time of the year again, it's time to \ntake\u0014\ninventory.\" Dr. McLennon Wrote that this was a word that had not yet \nentered\u0014\ninto his vocabulary. When an opportune moment arrived, he went up to \nthe\u0014\nkindly older man and asked, Sir, what is an inventory? Patiently the \nowner\u0014\nexplained that it was a time when you made a list of everything that \nyou\u0014\nhad--from groceries on the shelves to wrapping paper and string. Still\u0014\nsomewhat puzzled, the young McLennon then asked, Why?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, responded the owner, its easy to forget exactly how much you \nhave\u0014\neach year. Every now and then you have to take an inventory just to \nsee what\u0014\nall you have.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat little story, to me, pretty well sums up what Thanksgiving is all\u0014\nabout. It is a time when each of us needs to ask ourselves the \nquestion:\u0014\nHave I taken inventory of my life lately? Have I made an effort to \ncount all\u0014\nthe things that I do have in life instead of complaining about the \nthings\u0014\nthat I don't have. It is a good exercise especially when we are of a \nmind to\u0014\nbrood or whine in self pity. Have you taken inventory lately?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I am suggesting here is not some shallow \"count your blessings\"\u0014\nplatitude. But from time to time, in a genuine kind of a way, we need \nto sit\u0014\ndown and do some talking to ourselves about all of the gifts and\u0014\nopportunities and challenges that God has given each one of us. \nPerhaps\u0014\nthere is a deep underlying wisdom in the hymn that says: \"Count\u0014\nyour blessings one by one, and you might be surprised what the Lord \nhas\u0014\ndone.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Happy(?) Advent \u0014\n\u0014\nby Ted Olsen, former assistant editor of Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's pretty common to hear complaints about the difficulty of keeping \nthe joy of the Christmas season. Or, more commonly, we hear people \ntalking about how this time of year is (as Andy Williams puts it) \n\"the hap-happiest season of all.\" The world seems so festive and \ncelebratory this month that we would never dream of complaining about \nitafter all, doesn't the world take note of Jesus at this time more \nthan any?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern arguments aside, the time before Christmas hasn't always been \na celebration. Like the Lenten season before Easter, Advent was once \na solemn preparation for Christmas. Actually, not Christmas exactly. \nOriginally it was a season preparing for Epiphany, January 6which \ncommemorates not Jesus' birth, but his adoration by the Magi (in the \nWest) or his baptism in the Jordan River (in the East). Some people \nclaim Advent was first celebrated by the apostle Peter, but the exact \nstarting date of the season has been lost to history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever it started, Advent originally was a time of fasting and \nself-reflection (instead of today's Christmas parties and \"thinking \nabout other people for a change.\") In the mid-300s, two events \nchanged that thinking: Constantine the Great built the Church of the \nNativity in Bethlehem, declaring Jesus' birthday a national holiday; \nand Julius, bishop of Rome, set the date as December 25. Christmas \ntook on a happier, more celebratory feel and became a time of joyous \nanticipation. (By the mid-400s, even the Eastern churchwith a few \nexceptionsrecognized December 25 as Christmas. However, Advent is \nstill a much more solemn occasion among Orthodox Christians, and the \nseason begins much earlierNovember 15 instead of the Sunday nearest \nNovember 30.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Western church no longer required fasting during \nAdvent, though more liturgical churches still encourage solemnity and \ndiscourage festivities. For the church, purple (and blue), not red \nand green, are this season's colors. Over time, Advent also became an \noccasion to prepare for Christ's second coming as well as to reflect \non his firstwhich worked great for us at the magazine as we prepared \nan issue on the Second Coming (issue 61).\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope I don't sound like a wet blanket. We at the magazine are \n\"historically incorrect\" too, with Christmas decorations around the \noffice, carols playing softly in the background, and Christmas \nparties. But as we endeavor to \"remember the reason for the season,\" \nit's helpful for us to remember that the meaning of the season has \nchanged substantially over the centuries.\u0014",

She felt terribly aloneso much so she \ndecided she was not going to decorate for Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nLate that afternoon the doorbell rang, and there was a delivery boy \nwith a box. He said, \"Mrs. Thornhope?\" She nodded. He said, \"Would \nyou sign here?\" She invited him to step inside and closed the door to \nget away from the cold. She signed the paper and said, \"What's in the \nbox?\" The young man laughed and opened up the flap, and inside was a \nlittle puppy, a golden Labrador Retriever. The delivery boy picked up \nthe squirming pup and explained, \"This is for you, Ma'am. He's six \nweeks old, completely housebroken.\" The young puppy began to wiggle \nin happiness at being released from captivity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who sent this?\" Mrs. Thornhope asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man set the animal down and handed her an envelope and \nsaid, \"It's all explained here in this envelope, Ma'am. The dog was \nbought last July while its mother was still pregnant. It was meant to \nbe a Christmas gift to you.\" The young man then handed her a book, \nHow to Care for Your Labrador Retriever.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn desperation she again asked, \"Who sent me this puppy?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the young man turned to leave, he said, \"Your husband, Ma'am. \nMerry Christmas.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe opened up the letter from her husband. He had written it three \nweeks before he died and left it with the kennel owners to be \ndelivered with the puppy as his last Christmas gift to her. The \nletter was full of love and encouragement and admonishments to be \nstrong. He vowed that he was waiting for the day when she would join \nhim. He had sent her this young animal to keep her company until then.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe wiped away the tears, put the letter down, and then remembering \nthe puppy at her feet, she picked up that golden furry ball and held \nit to her neck. Then she looked out the window at the lights that \noutlined the neighbor's house, and she heard from the radio in the \nkitchen the strains of \"Joy to the World, the Lord has Come.\" \nSuddenly Stella felt the most amazing sensation of peace washing over \nher. Her heart felt a joy and a wonder greater than the grief and \nloneliness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Little fella,\" she said to the dog, \"It's just you and me. But you \nknow what? There's a box down in the basement I'll bet you'd like. \nIt's got a little Christmas tree in it and some decorations and some \nlights that are going to impress you. And there's a manger scene down \nthere. Let's go get it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod has a way of sending a signal of light to remind us life is \nstronger than death. Light is more powerful than darkness. God is \nmore powerful than Satan. Good will overcome evil.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light,\" the prophet \nsaid. \"On those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light \nhas dawned\" (Matthew 4:16).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Robert Russell, writer and pastor, Preaching Today #195\u0014",

    "words": "He was so poor at planning that he often ran short of food on his \nexpeditions, and he declined to consult with his second-in-command \nbefore attacking the home port of an enemy fleet. Nevertheless, Sir \nFrancis Drake (1540-1596) was one of the greatest raiders in \nseafaring history, and his raid on the Spanish port of Cadiz in 1586 \nwas his most daring triumph.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrake was a typical sea dog of England's Elizabethan era, first going \nto sea as a 13-year-old and soon thereafter making transatlantic \nvoyages to steal the golden cargo of Spanish ships in Central \nAmerica. By 1580, he had captained the first English ship to \ncircumnavigate the globe, and was knighted by the queen aboard his \nship, the Golden Hind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe harassment of Spanish ships by English privateers like Drake \ncontributed to growing tensions between Europe's two greatest naval \npowers, and in 1586, the Spanish decided to attack England with a \nmighty armada. Drake, however, had been given permission from the \nqueen to attack Spanish shipping, and he quickly assembled a fleet of \n23 ships and sailed directly for Cadiz, where the Spanish Armada was \ngathering.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrake believed that the Spanish were never ready for battle, and that \na strike at one of their main ports would succeed by the sheer \naudacity of the act. His second-in-command, Vice Admiral William \nBorough, expected Drake to meet with his officers before the attack, \nbut Drake sailed right into the enemy harbor and commenced firing \nupon every Spanish ship he could. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen that April day was over, Drake had sunk three large ships and \ndelayed the Spanish Armada's departure by one year. It would not be \nthe last time the Spanish sailors had to face the man they called \n\"The Dragon Drake\"--in 1588, he played a key role in England's \nultimate victory over the Armada.\u0014\n\u0014\nHB Club\u0014",

    "words": "They really didn't understand it. But, of course, they really had no \nmeans\u0014\nto. How could they have possibly known that it was contagious only \nafter\u0014\nlong periods of very close contact? The only thing they knew about it \nwas\u0014\nwhat it looked like and what it did to a person in the advanced \nstages. That\u0014\nthey knew well. They understood how it maimed and disfigured. And \nthat was\u0014\nenough for fear to take over.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm talking about the disease of leprosy. In a world and a time in \nwhich the\u0014\ndisease has all but been eradicated except in small pockets, we \nperhaps\u0014\ncannot appreciate the fear that accompanied the word in the ancient \nworld of\u0014\nJesus. It was a red flag word. It brought about the same responses as \nthe\u0014\nword Plague did in the 1200s, or Small Pox in the 1700s, or Aids in \nthe\u0014\n1900s. It frightened them. They felt largely helpless against it, as \nindeed\u0014\nthey were.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happens when fear takes over is that people do not act, they \nreact. And\u0014\nthe reaction to leprosy was both swift and cruel. Oftentimes the \nperson\u0014\nwould be put to death by his own family. It seems incredible to us \ntoday,\u0014\nbut on the edge of every large city in the ancient world huge pits \nwere dug,\u0014\nand in those pits lived the lepers of the community.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if, by some remote possibility, they did get away from this hovel \nand\u0014\nventure out into the streets, they would be quickly greeted with \nshouts of\u0014\n\"leper,\" accompanied by stones and rocks to make them keep their \ndistance.\u0014\nIn Jesus day a leper by law could not get within fifty yards of a \nclean\u0014\nperson. So this was the heart of the matter. Not only did these \nwretched\u0014\npoor people have to endure the trials of an incurable affliction, \nthey also\u0014\nwere isolated from society and kept from the community of faith. The \nhorror\u0014\nof disease, a lifestyle of loneliness, isolation and hopelessness, \nwhere\u0014\ncould they find hope? The only friend a leper had was God himself. In \nthis\u0014\nlife they were doomed. It was walking death.\u0014",

A crowd last night broke \nthe windows of a factory because its workers refused to strike.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe methods of the Cossacks, as I saw them this afternoon, are to \nmake a cordon with their horses at opposite ends of the streets. \nMeanwhile, other troops ride through the crowd. The feeling of the \npeople is not hostile to the Cossacks. For the most part the crowds \nare good tempered, and there is still hope that serious conflict will \nbe avoided.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe general character of the excitement is vague. Throughout \nyesterday the streets were full of people, although Petrograd is \nheavily patrolled by Cossacks and mounted police; most of the crowd, \nincluding many women, were out to watch other people make trouble. \nThe general atmosphere of excitement is like a bank holiday with \nthunder in the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the sitting of the Duma today it was announced that Prince \nGahtzin was calling a special conference to take measures for \npreventing a crisis in many places by demonstrators jumping on the \ncars and removing the controller handles. Yet extremely good \nrelations continued to exist between the crowd and the Cossacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowds often cheered the soldiers, thus giving the lie to those \nwho tried to pretend they were hostile to the war. Both the \n\"Marseblaise\" and the national anthem were sung. At night the whole \ntown was quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\nPetrograd, March 11, (Dispatch to The London Morning Post.) - The \nquestion of the food supply of the capital of Russia has reached a \ncrisis. Petrograd is particularly badly situated on the confines of \nthe empire, in a region incapable of producing breadstuffs, and \ntherefore wholly dependent upon railways for the necessaries of daily \nlife. Military needs necessarily absorb the greater part of railway \nactivity, and the war traffic naturally tends to increase rather than \ndiminish as time goes on. The people have cheerfully endured every \nmanner of inconvenience throughout the long Winter in obtaining food \nsupplies. Latterly, however, there has been witnessed the phenomenon \nof shortage in certain quarters of the city of the staple food of the \ncommon people, namely, the favorite Russian black bread.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Duma opened, the Minister of Agriculture, Rittich, brought \nthis all important question of food supplies before the members. The \nDuma, however, seemed indisposed to devote too much time to the \nconsideration of such a vital practical matter, and preferred to \nlisten to speeches on the so-called political situation, of which the \nalleged mismanagement of Russia's inexhaustible food supplies is \nregarded as only a part. The Duma put in only five days' sittings \nsince it opened, and a great part of these has been spent on speeches \nexpressive of the general dissatisfaction with the Government without \nleading to any practical results.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday a number of women and younger men of the working classes \nmade a peaceful demonstration of protest against the mismanagement of \nthe food supplies. A similar movement was noticed in certain quarters \nof the city yesterday. Last night an extraordinary meeting was \nsummoned of ministers, Representatives of both legislative chambers, \nthe municipality, and other public bodies to discuss measures to \nallay public alarm.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom speeches made in the Duma this morning, it is clear there never \nhas been any real shortage in Petrograd, although a heavy blizzard in \nSouth Russia, extending over weeks, interfered with the regular \narrival of supplies from the grain-growing districts. The people, \nowing to the prevalence of pernicious rumors, appear to have been \ncollecting stores of foodstuffs in advance, thereby causing a certain \nshortage, inasmuch as the food controller continued to issue only \nnormal quantities. The extraordinary meeting last night decided in \nprinciple to hand over the whole question of food supply to the \npublic self-governing bodies, the municipalities, and the Zemstvos.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain speeches in the Duma this morning pretty plainly indicate \nthat a political object is at the bottom of the panicky state of mind \nwhich was recently created in Petrograd on the subject of the food \nsupply.\u0014",

How September 11 was only the most dramatic \nexample of a new breed of\u0014\n                     terrorism, even now poised to strike again, that \nwas born and nurtured in Saudi Arabia\u0014\n                     and quietly unleashed on the international \ncommunity. \u0014\n                     2. The deadly recipe that creates the new \nterrorism: a broad financial and military\u0014\n                     network mixed together with a strong motivating \nideology that could compel people to\u0014\n                     sacrifice their lives and commit mass murder. \nBoth of these ingredients grew together\u0014\n                     in Saudi Arabia, in a movement called Wahhabism. \u0014\n                     3.

Internal\u0014\n                     Palestinian intelligence and political reports \nexplicitly tie Saudi Arabia to radical\u0014\n                     Palestinian terrorist groups engaged in suicide \nbombings.

    "title": "HE'S OUR MAN -- THOMAS AQUINAS",
    "words": "The Link: He's Our Man\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals can embrace a rich inheritance from Aquinas.\u0014\nA conversation with Norman Geisler\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 1974 Christianity Today article marking the 700th anniversary of \nAquinas's death, author Ronald Nash said some nice things about the \ndeceased but ultimately judged his system of thought \"unsuitable for \na biblically centered Christian philosophy\" and \"beyond any hope of \nsalvage.\" Norman Geisler disagreed with that assessment then, and he \ndisagrees with it now. We asked Dr. Geisler, president of Southern \nEvangelical Seminary and author of Thomas Aquinas: An Evangelical \nAppraisal (Baker, 1991), for his evaluation of the Angelic Doctor.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou've studied Aquinas for 45 years now. What makes him so appealing?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe's insightful, he's incisive, he's comprehensive, he's systematic, \nhe's biblical, he's devout, and he's successful. By successful, I \nmean, first, how many other books are still being read 700 years \nlater? Second, he single-handedly withstood the onslaught of \nintellectual Islam in the thirteenth century. He reversed the course \nof history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy isn't Aquinas more popular with evangelicals?\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals have largely misinterpreted Aquinas, and they have \nplaced on him views that he did not hold. Many people are concerned \nthat he separated faith and reason, denied depravity (especially the \neffects of sin on the human mind), and stood for everything that \n\"Roman Catholic\" means to Protestants today. Let me take those \nconcerns one by one.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis Schaeffer criticized Aquinas for giving rise to modern \nhumanism and atheism by separating faith and reason. Aquinas would do \ncartwheels in his casket if he heard that!\u0014\nHe believed in the integration of faith and reason, not the \nseparation. He made a distinction but no disjunction. Aquinas said \nthat faith brings the highest kind of certainty and that reason, weak \nand fallen, cannot attain Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Aquinas held human reason in such high regard that some accuse \nhim of denying depravity. He did not. He believed in original sin, he \nbelieved in the effects of sin on the mind, and he believed that the \nmind was so depraved that it could not know supernatural truths. \nGod's revealed truths could be accepted only by faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then there's the concern that Aquinas was a Roman Catholic, and \nwe Protestants disagree with Catholicism at key points. In truth, \nmost Protestants today could have accepted what the Roman Catholic \nchurch taught up to the hobbes's of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Martin Luther and John Calvin believed that the Roman Catholic \nchurch, up to the Council of Trent, was basically orthodoxa true \nchurch with sound fundamental doctrines as well as significant error.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the Catholic beliefs that concern Protestants most were not \ndeclared dogma until long after Aquinas. For example, Aquinas denied \nthe immaculate conception of Mary, and it was not declared dogma \nuntil 1854. Aquinas never believed in the bodily assumption of Mary, \nwhich was defined in 1950. Aquinas didn't believe in the \ninfallibility of the pope. That was not pronounced until 1870600 \nyears after Aquinas.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, Aquinas held many beliefs associated with the \nReformation. He upheld a version of sola scriptura. He believed in \nsalvation by grace through faithjust look at his commentary on \nEphesians 2:8-9.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Gerstner, the late Calvinist theologian, went so far as to claim \nthat Aquinas was basically a Protestant.\u0014\nHow can we avoid the misconceptions and find the real Aquinas?\u0014\n\u0014\nRead him! Quotes and excerpts in other people's books don't count, \nbecause many of his critics have taken him out of context. Get it \nfrom the horse's mouth, or should I say the dumb ox's mouth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAquinas is worth reading. He has stood the test of hobbes's. And even \nwhere he errs, you can learn more from the errors of a great mind \nthan you can learn from the truths of a small mind. You can see a \nwhole lot farther standing on the shoulders of giants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat will people find when they read Aquinas, besides philosophy?\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are rediscovering Aquinas as a biblical exegete. He wrote some \nof the greatest commentaries on the Bibleno one has surpassed his \ncommentary on the Gospels to this day. He has 10 pages on John 1:1, \nand 78 pages on chapter one. He culls from the Fathers, from the \nsecond century up to the thirteenth century, and weaves them together \nin a continuous commentary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, he was a member of the Order of Preachers. They had to \npreach the Bible every day and go through the entire Bible in three \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can thinkers engaged in today's theological and philosophical \ndebates learn from Aquinas?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can learn from him in the way he answered Muslim Aristotelianism. \nHe answered it by fighting bad ideas with good ideas, by fighting the \npen with the pen, not the sword. We're not going to win the battle of \nideas by the sword. We're going to win the battle of ideas with \nideasbetter ones, more logical ones, more consistent ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, we can learn how important it is to understand the philosophy \nof the day. It's like 1 Chronicles 12:32 says, the men of Issachar \n\"understood the times.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAquinas studied the philosophy of the day, which was Aristotle. He \nunderstood it better than his opponents, and he could use it to \nrefute opponents who misused it. We need to do the same thing in \nevery field.\u0014\n\u0014\nAquinas is a tremendous example for us because, today, the basic \nbattle is the battle for God. The only way we're going to defend the \northodox, historic viewheld by Aquinas, Augustine, the Reformers, \nand the creeds and councils of the churchthat God knows the future \ninfallibly, that God is eternal and unchangeable, that God even \nexists, is to go back to Aquinas and his great arguments.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can Christians who aren't theologians or philosophers learn from \nAquinas?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst of all, his absolute, unconditional commitment to Christ. He \nwas an extremely devout person. He spent hours in prayer and Bible \nreading and Bible study. His whole life had a biblical basisjust \nread his prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one Thomistic class I took at a Catholic institution, the \nprofessor would pray a brief part of one of Aquinas' prayers before \nclass. He would say, \"Inspire us at the beginning, direct our \nprogress, and complete the finished task within us.\" Aquinas had such \na succinct way of getting to the heart of an issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's another of his prayers: \"Give me, O Lord, a steadfast heart, \nwhich no unworthy affection may drag downwards; give me an \nunconquered heart, which no tribulation can wear out; give me an \nupright heart, which no unworthy purpose may tempt aside. Bestow on \nme also, O Lord my God, understanding to know you, diligence to seek \nyou, wisdom to find you, and faithfulness that may finally embrace \nyou, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI can't tell you how Aquinas has enriched and changed my life, my \nthought. He has helped me to be a better evangelical, a better \nservant of Christ, and to better defend the faith that was delivered, \nonce for all, to the saints.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE EARLY CHRISTIANS SAW HEAVEN",
    "words": "Christian History Corner: How the Early Church Saw Heaven\u0014\nThe first Christians had very specific ideas about who they would \nmeet in the afterlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong | posted 08/09/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nAs this week's Newsweek cover article insists, heaven is a powerful \nand pervasive word. It has been used to motivate people of many \nfaiths in many ways: To instill character and strengthen resolve. To \nbuild community and spur change. To steel terrorists and comfort \nvictims. It is easy to imagine this word, as the writer of the \nNewsweek article does, on the lips of both the hijackers of American \nAirlines Flight 11 and many of the passengers.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently, although ministers in mainline Christian churches in \nAmerica don't preach much about heaven, 75 percent of Americans \nbelieve they'll go thereif they're good. Evangelicals talk more \nabout the subject, believing that only faith in Christ can put them \non the \"highway to heaven.\" And most folks expect that once through \nthe gates, they will see not only their Lord, but also their loved \nones (for some, including their pets).\u0014\n\u0014\nFor thoughtful Christians, all of this raises the question, \"What did \nthe early church believe about heaven?\" The answer draws together \nboth divine communion and human reunion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the apostles, heaven-as-divine-communion was a given. Indeed, in \nthe New Testament the word \"heaven\" is often used to stand for God \nhimself (Luke 15:21; Matt. 21:25, 23:22; John 3:27).\u0014\nplace, too. As Jesus had promised, \"I go to prepare a place for \nyouthat where I am you may be also\" (John 14:3-4). And this place \nwas not simple, but rather a complicated space with rooms or levels \n(an idea the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri would expand upon to \nunforgettable effect over a millennium later). In 2 Corinthians \n12:2-4, the Apostle Paul pulls perhaps the biggest tease of the Bible \nwhen he tells of being lifted up into \"the third heaven,\" where he \nexperienced \"things so astounding\" that, to the great disappointment \nof his readers ever since, \"they cannot be told\" (New Living \nTranslation). \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only was heaven a place, it was populated. Especially during the \ncenturies of Roman persecution, Christians looked forward to \ncommuning after death not only with God, but with each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest evidence of this trend is The Martyrdom of Perpetua and \nFelicity, an account of two Christian women killed in Carthage (in \nNorth Africa) around 202 or 203. This book records a dream Perpetua \nhad in prison just before she and her companions were thrown to the \nwild beasts. In the dream Perpetua saw her sickly brother, \nDinocrates, who had died at the age of 7, in heaven drinking from the \nfountain of life. In the same book, other soon-to-be-martyred Roman \ncaptives envisioned themselves after death joyously rejoining their \nfellow martyrs in a garden paradise.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Martyrdom was a widely circulated book, and it may well have \nshaped many early Christians' visions of their eternal reward. For \nexample, we find communal images of heavenas banquet and as \nplayground for Christian childrendepicted on the walls of the \nChristians' catacomb hideouts beneath Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch pictures of heavenly human fellowship, however, didn't push God \nfrom the center of the picture. Clement of Alexandria, one of the \nearliest fathers, \\said in the second century that heaven was above \nall the place where believers received the vision of God from Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, by the year 400, with the era of persecution ended, the \ncommunal and sensual aspects of heaven seemed to recede as God \nhimself took center stage again. Christian leaders wrote increasingly \nof heaven as, above all, the place where one participated in God's \nspiritual perfection. For the 4th-century Eastern Father Gregory of \nNazianzus, heaven was where the tired pilgrim could finally \\rest in \nGod. There the Christian could at last, released from the \ndistractions of the flesh, enjoy \\the full nearness of Christtasted \nonly briefly and tantalizingly on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine of Hippo (354-430) painted his vision of heaven in the \ngreat City of God. He wrote the book as humanity's highest societal \nachievement, the Roman Empire, tottered on the brink of dissolution. \nAgainst this backdrop he turned his eyes upward to a kingdom whose \nsplendor far surpassed that of the world beneath. In his Confessions, \nAugustine had insisted that \"our heart does not rest until it rests \nin God.\" Now he painted heaven as one long embracean embrace of God, \nand an embrace of other people who love Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nTreasuring this vision of eternal communion and community, Christians \never since have looked forward to a time and a place where \"the young \nwomen will dance for joy, and the menold and youngwill join in the \ncelebration.\" So said Jeremiah, the \"weeping prophet,\" who though he \nlived before the word \"heaven\" was first spoken, still insisted that \nhe heard God say \"I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for \nrejoicing.\" (Jer. 31:13, NLT)\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is associate editor of Christian History magazine. \nThis article draws from Colleen McDannell and Bernhard Lang's Heaven: \nA History and Everett Ferguson's Encyclopedia of Early Christianity.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Packer | posted 04/24/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nWon't heaven's joy be spoiled by our awareness of unsaved loved ones \nin hell?\u0014\nWilliam P. Bunnell, Redlands, California \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, I resonate with the question to the depths of my soul. Loved \nones of my own, some living, some dead, have not shared my faith in \nChrist. That is painful.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, belief in the outright annihilation of nonbelievers after \nfinal judgment (as opposed to an eternal punishment) seems to me \nbiblically illegitimate. I suspect some Christians whose loved ones \ndie without accepting Christ are tempted to embrace the \nannihilationist view. Scripture, however, seems to show that one \naspect of human dignity is that we are built to last. Whether for joy \nor for sorrow, our souls are eternal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, Scripture and good biblical theology indicate that none will \nbe in hell who did not effectively choose it by following in the \nfootsteps of Adam and preferring their own way to God's. In some \nfashion, God reveals himself and his will to everyone, and everyone \nresponds in one way or another (see Rom. 1:182:16). But nonbelievers \nuniversally make the anti-God choice, and hell is God giving people \nwhat they chose. That is realityretributive realityand an abiding \nconsequence of following our heart and doing what we want to do; I \nwish I could persuade more people to face this seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow pose the question in its toughest form. Imagine a believing \nspouse or parent who loved, prayed for, and agonized over a dear one \nwho resisted the gospel and died suddenly in an accident. There are \nno grounds for thinking that this or any other memory will be erased \nin heaven. So how can it not keep the bereaved one from heaven's \ntotal joy?\u0014\n\u0014\nSignificantly, this is not a Bible problem; instead, Scripture rules \nout all thought of it ever becoming anyone's problem. For it tells us \nthat God the Father (who now pleads with mankind to accept the \nreconciliation that Christ's death secured for all) and God the Son \n(our appointed Judge, who wept over Jerusalem) will in a final \njudgment express \"wrath\" and administer justice against rebellious \nhumans. God's holy righteousness will hereby be revealed; God will be \ndoing the right thing, vindicating himself at last against all who \nhave defied him, and there is no hint that this hurts the Judge more \nthan it hurts the sinner. (Read through Matt. 25; John 5:2229; Rom. \n2:516, 12:19; 2 Thess. 1:79; Rev. 18:119:3, 20:1135, and you will \nsee that clearly.) God will judge justly, and all angels, saints, and \nmartyrs will praise him for it. So it seems inescapable that we \nshall, with them, approve the judgment of personsrebelswhom we have \nknown and loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat sounds appalling; how can it be? Remember, in heaven our minds, \nhearts, motives, and feelings will be sanctified, so that we are \nfully conformed to the character and outlook of Jesus our Lord. This \nwill happen at or before our bodily resurrection. How we shall then \nthink and feel is really beyond our knowing, just as a chrysalis \ncould not know what it feels like to be a butterfly till it becomes \none.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut certainly the promise that God will wipe away every tear from \nbelievers' eyes (Rev. 7:17) will find its fulfillment as one aspect \nof this transformation. In heaven, glorifying God and thanking him \nfor everything will always absorb us. All our love for and joy in \nothers who are with us in heaven will spring from their doing the \nsame, and love and pity for hell's occupants will not enter our \nhearts. Their hell will not veto our heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nGranted, this sounds to us more like hard-heartedness than \nChristlikeness, yet Christlikeness is precisely what it will be. Our \ndifficulty is that we cannot now conceive the heavenly condition in a \nfull way.\u0014\n\u0014\nWrote Richard Baxter: \"My knowledge of that life is small, / The eye \nof faith is dim; / But it's enough that Christ knows all, / And I \nshall be with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.I. Packer is an executive editor of CT and a professor of theology \nat Regent College in Vancouver.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "HOW JOHN WESLEY CHANGED AMERICA",
    "words": "How John Wesley Changed America\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy should Wesley's 300th birthday be a red-letter day on this side \nof the ocean?\u0014\nby Chris Armstrong \u0014\n\u0014\nThe world is now marking the 300th anniversary of the birth of John \nWesley with celebrations, conferences, publications, and many other \ncommemorations. (For trivia buffs and sticklers: The actual day of \nWesley's birth was June 17 or June 28, 1703, depending on whether you \nfollow the \"old style\" calendar in use before 1752 or the \"new style\" \ncalendar used after that year.) But Americans may wonder, What \ndifference did Wesley make to our country? After all, while he served \nas a parish minister in Savannah, he didn't last two years in the \npost before incurring the colonists' wrath and before returning to \nEngland.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, America has a special claim on the man and his legacy. It \nwas here that Methodism first became a separate \ndenominationseparating from Wesley's beloved Church of England. \nWesley reluctantly blessed the separation for a pragmatic reason: so \nmany people were entering the church through Methodist ministry that \nthere weren't enough Anglican priests to serve them the Lord's \nSupper. So Methodists had to be given the authority to ordain their \nown ministers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica changed Methodism, and soon Methodism began returning the \nfavor. In 1800, it was still a fairly small Protestant denomination \namong many others. By 1900, it had grown be the largest of them all. \nThe small space of a newsletter won't allow more than a brief summary \nof the changes Wesley and his heirs brought to America, but we can at \nleast begin to tell the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost significantly, Wesley and Methodism joined other \nevangelistically minded Christians in promoting a faith deeply felt \nand actively lived. Christianity was no spectator sport for Wesley. \nFrom his Oxford \"Holy Club\" days to the end of his life, he sought to \nbe a True Christianunlike the many nominal \"almost Christians\" he \nsaw in the Established church around him. And his deepest desire was \nto help others do the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Wesley, a True Christian was marked by two inseparable qualities: \nholiness and happiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his Plain Account of Christian Perfection, Wesley defined holiness \nnot as achieving sinless perfection but as having one's heart fully \nfixed on God, setting aside all other affections\"perfect love.\" His \nteachings on the subject combined the spiritual athleticism of \nWilliam Law's Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life, the Moravian \nemphasis on felt assurance of salvation (which Wesley extended to \ninclude sanctification), and the Puritan insistence onminute \nexamination of conscience coupled with sanctified action in all \nspheres of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis emphasis on sanctification became the hallmark of Wesley's \nmovement. He often said that the mission of Methodism was to \"spread \nscriptural holiness throughout the land.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis was no extreme ascetic holiness, however, mortifying the heart as \nwell as the flesh. Rather, Wesley taught that True Christianity \nfulfilled all of a person's deepest, truest desires, making the \nChristian a happier, more productive person. When pressed to define \n\"the character of a Methodist,\" he answered, in a 1742 tract of that \ntitle: \"God is the joy of [the Methodist's] heart. . . . He is \ntherefore happy in God, yea, always happy, as having in him 'a well \nof water springing up into everlasting life', and 'overflowing his \nsoul with peace and joy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as their founder had experienced having his \"heart strangely \nwarmed\" in 1738 at a meeting on Aldersgate Street, Methodists \npracticed a religion of joy. Frontier Americans cracked jokes about \nthe \"shouting Methodists,\" but the Wesleyans wore the label as a \nbadge of honor. They felt their own joy was one of the best \nadvertisements for the truth of the message they preached.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen white American Methodists began encountering Africans in the \nslave South, they found in the feeling, physically expressive \ntraditional spirituality of Africans a natural complement to their \nown lively faith. Soon many African Americans joyously accepted the \ngospel through the Methodist witnessthough most remained appalled at \nthe hypocrisy and cruelty of so many \"Christian\" slave masters. Slave \nChristians expressed the joy of a new, inner spiritual freedom in \ntheir conversion testimonies, spirituals, and dancing \"shouts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, white and black Methodists began mixing at camp \nmeetings and churches (though with some of the restraint that would \nlater manifest as segregation, leading to the birth of the African \nMethodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal Zion churches). \nAt such meetings, for a season, the two races enjoyed together what \nwhite denominational leaders loved to call \"melting times\" of \ncelebratory fellowship, sometimes shouting, sometimes falling \nblissfully in the Spirit, always telling the Good News and testifying \nto its reality in their hearts. Here is one strong root of recent \nattempts to heal the ugly racial divide in this country's churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Wesley, the impact of True Christianity was never to stop within \nthe body of believers, however blissful its fellowship. From his Holy \nClub days at Oxford through to the end of his life, he insisted on \nthe importance of works of mercy. He and his fellow Oxford Methodists \ngave significant portions of their income to succor the poor and \nspent much time ministering to condemned prisoners (after a lifetime \nof lavish giving, Wesley died a relatively poor man). Wesley also \nabhorred slavery, and for at least the early decades of America's \ninvolvement in that dark institution, Methodists were among those \nmost firm in their opposition to slavery (their later record was not \nso sterlingsee Don Mathews's Religion in the Old South).\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch crusades as the successful fight to reduce the drunkenness \nrampant in nineteenth-century America also found significant \nleadership within MethodismWomen's Christian Temperance Union \npresident Frances Willard is just one example. By the close of the \nnineteenth century, the Salvation Army, a Wesleyan denomination, was \ndoing more for the poor in America than any other group.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his landmark book Revivalism and Social Reform, historian Timothy \nL. Smith has laid forever to rest the old myth that the concern for \n\"souls\" and the concern for social reform have never met in American \nreligion. His \"Exhibit A\"? The reforming efforts of people who \nidentified with the nineteenth-century Wesleyan holiness movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book and Donald Dayton's Discovering an Evangelical Heritage are \nstill well worth reading on this major aspect of Wesleyans' impact in \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Methodism and its holiness and Pentecostal offshoots have not \nalways upheld this heritage of social action, they often havein \nspectacular ways. Perhaps the most visible sign of their success in \nevangelical Wesleyan circles is the holiness and Pentecostal \nstorefront churcha twentieth-century fixture in many inner-city \nareas from which more \"mainstream\" churches fled, creating a \"donut \neffect.\" Those churches often served more than the spiritual needs of \ntheir congregations, linking to an array of social ministries.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley and his followers changed the American landscape in many other \nways.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey helped democratize America's churches, empowering the laitymale \nand female, black and whiteto carry the gospel across the country. \nThe first woman ordained in a Protestant church in America, \nAntoinette Brown Blackwell (1825-1921), was a Methodist, and the \nSalvation Army is the only modern denomination in which ordained \nleadership comprises over 50 percent women.\u0014\n\u0014\nMethodists helped pioneer the original \"focus on the family,\" making \nthe Victorian era the heyday of home-based religious instruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile maintaining a lively understanding of the Christian's need for \ngrace, Methodists spread Wesley's Arminian emphasis on the place of \nhuman will and responsibility in the religious lifetouching and \nchanging almost all other Protestant denominations in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley read the Church Fathers avidly, seeking to make his movement \nreflect the purity, simplicity, and communal power of the early \nchurch. His followers joined him in this, taking especially the \napostolic church of Acts as their model. This emphasis reached its \nfullest flower when the Pentecostal churches revived the \"gifts of \nthe Spirit\" enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's emphasis on the small groupmost famously, his disciplined, \nclose-knit \"CLASS meetings\"has shaped the landscape of modern \nAmerican spirituality through \"cell groups,\" Bible studies, and many \nother small-group modes of fellowship and worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's organizational genius was reflected in the massive growth of \nthe nineteenth-century American Methodist denominational \"machine,\" \nwhich met regularly to celebrate its growth in the most precise \nmathematical terms and to govern its ministry with an organizational \nacumen that would put many major corporations to shame. Here, \nperhaps, are the roots of the modern American \"megachurch.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's passion for educationhe insisted all his preachers read, \nand he equipped each of them to sell the books produced by the \nmassive Methodist publishing enterpriseis reflected in many American \ncolleges and universities. This focus on education also transformed \nthe church itself, through the agency of the Sunday Schoolan \ninstitution that owed much of its nineteenth-century dominance and \nmodern shape to such Methodist leaders as John Heyl Vincent, founder \nof Chautauqua.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast, but decidedly not least, the richly theological hymns of John's \nbrother Charles, and the later compositions of Wesleyan hymn writer \nFanny Crosby, continue to enrich the hymnals of churches far beyond \nthe bounds of Methodismfrom Presbyterians to Lutherans.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn these and many other ways, John Wesley changed the United \nStatesand the world. Happy 300th, John! We would be poorer had you \nnot lived.\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "HISTORY DOESN'T SUPPORT \"CHRISTIAN AMERICA\"",
    "words": "History Doesnt Support Notion of Christian America\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Wilson\u0014\n07-08-03 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a Christian America is deeply entrenched in a broad \nsegment of citizens of the United States. Where the does the notion \narise and can it be supported?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a matter of history the idea of a Christian America is the product \nof the merging of three very different periods spanning 150 years \nleading up to the Revolutionary War. Proponents of a Christian \nAmerica fail to separate the contexts of the Puritan settlement of \nNew England in the mid-17th century, the revivalism associated with \nthe Great Awakening in the mid-18th century and the philosophical \nmovement among the likes of Jefferson and Franklin in the late 18th \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the earliest colonists to arrive in North America were Puritans \nwho fled persecution from the Church of England. From the beginning \nof their adventure in the New World these Puritans cultivated the \nconviction that New England was nothing less than Gods New Israel. \nIn part they supported their convictions with a creative reading of \nIsaiahs many references to the coastlands (see Isaiah 41 and 42, \nfor example, especially Isaiah 42.4: and the coastlands wait for his \n[the servant of the Lords] teaching).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most famous of the Puritan settlers in New England were Increase \nMather and his son, Cotton. The elder Mather made his mark in \ncolonial America as the first president of Harvard and his \nprogressive attitude of working with diverse segments of the \nMassachusetts colony. The younger Mather is best remembered for his \nexpansive history of America, Magnalia Christi Americana. Cotton \nMathers work was in part an attempt to revive the Puritan experiment \nand influence in New England, which had waned by the end of the 17th \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 18th century a new wave of religious consciousness swept the \ncolonies. The Great Awakening spread westward and southward out of \nNew England. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Northeast Jonathan Edwards--a Puritan--developed a following, \npressing hard for an active pietism among those who responded to the \ngospel. In the middle states and into the South, George Whitfield--an \nArminian--made great gains as a revivalist. Even John Wesley \nconducted a preaching mission in Georgia, promoting the Arminian \ntheology of the emerging Methodist church. The Christian church \nincreased in its influence and, in the process, fanned the fires of \nfreedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nArguably the enthusiasm of the Great Awakening and its insistence \nupon personal accountability fueled a growing impetus toward freedom \nin the colonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of the 18th century a thoroughly philosophical movement \nemerged in the colonies. British political philosophers Thomas Hobbes \nand John Locke tried to sort out implications of the Protestant \nReformation and the recent revolution in England. Building on their \nmusings, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin--among \nothers--articulated a vision of government rooted in natural law.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere Jefferson and Franklin and others religious? Without a doubt. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were deeply committed to confessions that by nature human \nbeings had broad rights. Jeffersons words in the Declaration of \nIndependence--We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men \nare created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \nthe pursuit of Happiness--are consistent with the passions and \npersuasions of Deists at the end of the 18th century and the \nbeginnings of the 19th. Deists believed that the Creator had forged \na universe founded upon law that governed all things, including the \nnatural and political arenas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere Jefferson and Franklin Christians? Absolutely not. \u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson was attracted to the moral teachings of Jesus, but he \nrejected all of the claims of the New Testament concerning the \ndivinity of Christ and his power to work miracles. The Jefferson \nBible makes clear that Jefferson could not be counted among \nChristians. \u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin likewise rejected the orthodox Christian teaching. Franklin \nthought that Jesus of Nazareth was a good philosopher, but he also \nbelieved the Jesus story had been perverted by superstition and \nlegend. Franklin flatly rejected claims that Jesus was the Son of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a Christian America depends on a particular reading of \nhistory. Those who collapse the influences of Puritan colonists, \nGreat Awakening revivalists, and Enlightenment philosophers into a \nsingle reality find evidence of a Christian America. On the other \nhand, those who see those features of American history as contiguous \nrather than continuous have good reasons not to claim that America is \nrooted in Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA careful reading of history will demonstrate that the idea of a \nChristian America can not be supported. A generation ago Reinhold \nNiebuhr cautioned against investing Christian values in any social \nor political institution. Niebuhr said that the best one can hope for \nis the presence of Christians in the midst of the political \nestablishment. Only then, he wrote, is there hope that the gospel \nmight transform the system.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Wilson is professor of theology and chair of the Roberts \nDepartment of Christianity at Mercer University in Macon, Ga.\u0014\nTop of Form 1\u0014\nBottom of Form 1\u0014",

    "words": "In 1865, Dr. Samuel Mudd of Maryland was sent to Fort Jefferson, a \nprison so harsh and remote that it was called the \"American Devil's \nIsland.\" His crime was setting, splinting, and bandaging a broken \nleg. Unfortunately, the patient was John Wilkes Booth, injured when \nhe had shot President Abraham Lincoln six hours earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt a military trial--chosen because Lincoln had been commander in \nchief of the Army--the prosecution argued that Mudd had been a \nSouthern sympathizer during the Civil War and had associated with \nConfederate agents, including Booth. The defense countered that the \ncivilian Mudd deserved a civil trial, that he had not recognized the \ninjured Booth and was merely a country doctor doing his job. But Mudd \nwas convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, missing the death \npenalty by only one vote. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with three other convicted conspirators, Mudd was sent to Fort \nJefferson on a desert island in the Dry Tortugas, 68 miles west of \nKey West, Florida. When he wrote his wife of the inhumane conditions, \nincluding a blistering climate and clouds of voracious mosquitoes, \nshe shared these complaints with President Andrew Johnson, who \nordered better treatment for Mudd. When the prison doctor died during \nan 1867 yellow fever plague, Dr. Mudd agreed to replace him under the \nemergency circumstances and, although himself seriously afflicted \nwith the disease, saved a number of lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nMudd miraculously survived and two years later was pardoned by \nPresident Johnson for his heroic actions. Back in Maryland, where \ncontroversy still swirled around the question of his guilt, Mudd put \nhis life back together and ran for the Maryland legislature in 1876. \nHis election made him the only convicted conspirator ever elected to \nsuch high office. \u0014\n\u0014\nMudd's descendants have sought to further clear his name, insisting \nthe presidential pardon did not change the conviction for conspiracy. \nThe most recent request was to President Ronald Reagan, who responded \nwith a letter explaining it was beyond his power.

    "words": "In April of 1521, a monk named Martin Luther was put on \ntrial by the\u0014\n             Roman Catholic Church. He had been severely critical of \nthe pope, questioning the validity\u0014\n             of some of the sacraments and denouncing church \ncorruption. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n             An archbishop was given the job of examining Luther, and \nhe asked him, Martin, how can\u0014\n             you assume that you are the only one to understand the \nsense of Scripture? ... You have\u0014\n             no right to call into question the most holy orthodox \nfaith. ... I ask you, Martin  answer\u0014\n             candidly without horns  do you or do you not repudiate \nyour books and the errors which\u0014\n             they contain?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n             Luther replied, Since, then, Your Majesty and your \nlordships desire a simply reply, I will\u0014\n             answer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am \nconvicted by Scripture and plain\u0014\n             reason  I do not accept the authority of popes and \ncouncils, for they have contradicted\u0014\n             each other  my conscience is captive to the Word of \nGod. I cannot and I will not recant\u0014\n             anything, for to go against conscience is neither right \nnor safe. Here I stand. I cannot do\u0014\n             otherwise. God help me. Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\n             At this trial, Luther was convicted of heresy. Anyone \ncaught following him was to be\u0014\n             condemned. But Luther and his followers were not crushed \n they went on to lead the\u0014\n             Protestant Reformation, the movement we commemorate \ntoday. We can be grateful that\u0014\n             Luther took a stand for what he believed in and worked \ntirelessly to bring the word of God\u0014\n             to common people, so that they could develop deeper \nfaith in Jesus Christ.\u0014",

    "title": "HYMN WRITER AUGUSTUS TOPLADY",
    "words": "August 11, 1778 \u0014\n\u0014\nHymn Writer Augustus Toplady\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustus Montague Toplady, clergyman and writer, was born November 4, \n1740, at Farnham, about 20 miles southwest of Windsor, England. He \nstudied at the Westminster School for a while, but was sent to \nIreland in 1755, the same year as his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Toplady was taken with John Wesley's teachings, but by 1758, \nhe had become an extreme Calvinist and had harsh words for Methodist \ntheology. Passionate for the Lord, he prayed, \"God keep me from being \na mere scholar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady received his degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts \nfrom Trinity College. Ordained deacon in 1762, he was licensed to the \ncuracy of Blagdon the same year. Two years later he was ordained as a \npriest, and until 1766 served as curate at Farleigh, Hungerford. For \nthe next two years he held the benefice of Harpford with Venn-Ottery, \nand for two years after that, of Broad Hembury. During 1775 he took a \nleave to minister to the French Calvinist Reformed Church in Orange \nStreet, London.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first published work was Poems on Sacred Subjects, Dublin, 1759. \nHis major works were the Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of \nthe Church of England (1774) and The Church of England Vindicated \nfrom the Charge of Arminianism (1769.) He was prone to polemics and \nwas cutting in his opposition to Wesley followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady suffered from tuberculosis. As his death neared, he sensed \nGod's presence. \"O what a day of sunshine this has been to me! I have \nnot words to express it. It is unutterable. O my friends, how good is \nGod!\" The day he died, he was calling, \"Come, Lord Jesus, come \nquickly!\" He told his friends that he could not live much longer for \nno mortal man could live after seeing the glories of God that he had \nseen. He was not quite thirty-eight when he died on this day, august \n11, 1778, but his short life-span was enough to produce one of the \nmost beloved of all hymns--Rock of Ages:\u0014\n\u0014\nRock of Ages cleft for me,\u0014\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\u0014\nLet the water and the blood\u0014\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed\u0014\nBe of sin the double cure;\u0014\nCleanse me from its guilt and power. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is said to have come to him when he stepped into a cleft of \nrock to take shelter from a storm, but the evidence does not bear \nthis out. The first appearance of that particular story was 70 years \nafter his death. More likely the hymn came from his meditation on God \nas our rock, which was a frequent theme in his sermons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew if any today read the the sermons or other books Augustus Toplady \nwrote, but we still sing his hymn. It has remained a favorite. Sung \nin churches or at home, it speaks of Christ's mercy to all ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCook, Paul E. G.

    "words": "He's Homeless -- and He's Rich!\u0014\nBum Inherits Windfall.\u0014\nHobo Set for Life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the story behind the headlines weren't true, you'd think you were \nhearing another formulaic Hollywood rags-to-riches tale. Max Melitzer \nwas homeless until his long-lost brother died and left him his entire \nestate.\u0014\n\u0014\nMax's life flipped upside down with his car in 1990. While driving \nhis wife and two friends through Wyoming, he lost control and rolled \noff the road. He survived, but his loved ones all died.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty years later, Max was pushing a shopping cart and all of life's \npossessions through the streets of Salt Lake City. Following the \nwreck, his sorrow became depression. Which became aimlessness. Which \nbecame vagrancy. After losing his friends and his apartment, he \ndrifted hopelessly between relationships and addresses. Eventually, \nhe lived homeless on the streets of Ogden and Salt Lake City.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily friend Karol Behling said, \"He was very much in love with his \nwife. And it was really hard for him -- one, to have her gone, and \ntwo, to have been driving.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough family loss initiated his downward spiral, another family loss \nmight be his redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\nMorris Melitzer hadn't seen his brother Max in 15 years. Though the \nfamily had initiated contact with him at times, they knew Max had \n\"emotional issues\" and preferred to be a recluse. Still, when \nultimately succumbing to his cancer battle, Morris' death-bed wish \nwas that his brother be found and given his estate\u0014\n.\u0014\nAfter a year of searching, Utah detective David Lundberg finally \nfound Max in a Salt Lake City park. He had recently been beaten up, \nhis watch and money stolen. Lundberg described Max as a sweet man in \nhis 60s, far more articulate than you would think.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a celebratory meal together -- the first fish Max had eaten in \n21 years -- Lundberg loaded Max onto a bus and sent him back to New \nYork to connect with his family and his inheritance.\u0014\n\u0014\nContrary to the fairy-tale headlines spinning this story, Morris' \nestate wouldn't set Max up for life. It was only about $100,000. And \nMax avoided the media after arriving in New York, so there aren't any \npublic reports that we've been able to find on how his story ended.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the story's more than enough to get us into this week's text, in \nwhich Paul is telling his own rags-to-riches inheritance story. \nUnlike Max's story, this one has a known ending: Servants or slaves \nare adopted as children of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul has used adoption imagery before (Romans 8, Ephesians 1), and \nhis idea here is similar. He imagines a minor due to get the family \ninheritance. While underage, minors and their future trust are under \ncontrol of a guardian (Colossians 4:1-2). In a spiritual parallel, \nGod's people were once under the stipulations of the Law, living like \nslaves held under external regulations (v. 3). \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Christ was born into that system of Law, fulfilled its \nrequirements on our behalf, and liberated God's people from it. \n\"Slaves\" could now become adopted children of God, even as a Roman \nslave might become a child of the master if adopted by that master \n(vv. 4-5).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe passage is dense and the theology hard-hitting. This text is an \nextreme makeover story; a metaphor for spiritual rags-to-riches. Like \ncaterpillar to monarch, our before and after demonstrate a radical \nidentity change with real implications.\u0014",

    "words": "January 24, 1722 \u0014\nHarvard Chair Went to Doubting Wigglesworth\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did America's great Christian colleges come to abandon their \nfaith and become the secular institutions they are today?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Harvard College was founded by the Puritans in 1636, they knew \nwell what they wanted from their school. \"Let every Student be \nplainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the maine \nend of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is \neternal life, John 17:3, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottome, \nas the only foundation of all found knowledge and Learning...\" The \ngreat school was intended to produce a godly clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn less than a hundred years, that high ideal faltered. Liberals won \ncontrol of the school. On this day, January 24, 1722, they appointed \nEdward Wigglesworth to fill the newly created Thomas Hollis chair at \nHarvard College. This made Mr. Wigglesworth the first divinity \nprofessor commissioned in the American colonies, but what should have \nbeen cause for rejoicing was actually reason to mourn.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Wigglesworth had convinced orthodox members his theology was \nsound, it was not. In Three Centuries of Harvard, Samuel Eliot \nMorison described what happened next: \"One of the first theologians \nin New England who dared publicly to challenge the 'five points of \nCalvinism,' he [Wigglesworth] employed the deadly method of doubt in \ninquiry, rather than direct attack... Wigglesworth was a prime \nfavorite with Harvard students, and he and his son Edward, who \nsucceeded, had a very great influence on New England theology. It was \nthe Wigglesworths who trained the pioneers of liberal Christianity in \nNew England--the ministers who led the way out of the lush but \nfearsome jungles of Calvinism, into the thin, clear light of \nUnitarianism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the evangelist George Whitefield came to the United States, he \ndenounced liberal colleges as \"abodes of darkness, a darkness which \ncould be felt.\" The men of Harvard were \"Pharisees, resting on head \nknowledge,\" he said. Wigglesworth retorted that Whitefield was \nfiscally corrupt, demonstrated bad manners and unleashed dangerous \nenthusiasm among the masses, destroying the peace of New England's \nparishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1701, Yale was founded to counter Harvard's drift from orthodox \nCalvinism. By 1805, Unitarians controlled Harvard. Had Wigglesworth \nhad a fervent faith, his appointment this day might have prevented \nthat slide to heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDictionary of American Biography.

On his deathbed he lamented the worthlessness \nof all he had done. He died on this day, August 28, 1645, convinced \nhe was a failure.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn Huig de Groot, he had latinized his name. He proved to be a \nprecocious lad. At ten he won accolades for his Latin. When eleven he \nwas called \"a second Erasmus.\" At 14 he completely revised Martianus \nCapella's encyclopedia, having read all the ancient authorities for \nhimself. He followed this with translations of Simon Stevin and \nAratus. At 15 he held public disputations and was made attach to the \ngreat John van Barneveld on a crucial peace mission. By 17 he had \nargued his first legal case and at 22 had written a book (not \npublished) which embodied his legal ideas in embryonic form.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrotius' first venture into international law was his book Mare \nLiberum. As its title implies, it argued for freedom of the seas. He \ntook his stand firmly on the rights of man. Grotius' work as a whole \nis notable for its tendency to escape pedantry. Although he cited \nmassive sources, he also exhibited a great deal of originality and \ncommon sense. Mare Liberum was no exception.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Netherlands entered a period of severe theological disputation. \nArminians and Calvinists were at odds. The States General issued an \nEdict of Pacification to cool tempers on both sides. This failed. \nBarneveld, Grotius and others saw Prince Maurice of Orange becoming a \ndictator. They supported the States General in negotiating a twelve \nyear truce with Spain. This infuriated Maurice. When Barneveld and \nGrotius suggested a peace formula, he had Barneveld executed and \nGrotius imprisoned for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the help of his faithful wife, Grotius escaped. He was lionized \nin other European countries. In exile he wrote his most famous book: \nThe Law of War and Peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book was badly needed. Christian Europe was in a tragic flux. \nWars of great cruelty ravaged the land. No mercy was shown anyone \nexcept by a few enlightened leaders such as Adolphus Gustavus (who \nadmired Grotius' work). To break oath with \"heretical\" enemies was \nthe norm.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough a Christian, Grotius relied far less on Biblical arguments \nthan was common for the time. Instead, he showed from Christian and \nheathen history how the best men of all ages had been merciful and \nkept faith in international affairs. Three years after his death the \nPeace of Westphalia in 1648 embodied many of the principles set forth \nby Grotius. Two hundred years later his work was recognized as the \nbasis of international law. Grotius' greatest efforts were aimed at \nestablishing peace between Christians, but he also wrote an \napologetic, Truth of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCopleston, Frederick Charles.

It is a hard task without any divine love \nor heavenly life to produce it. Why try any longer to cover your \nnakedness with fig leaves...\" Henry Alline preached with this kind of \nfervor.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter years of desperate search, years in which he trembled that he \nwould be forever damned, Henry discovered the love of Christ in 1775. \nHe had cried out for mercy, saying, \"O Lord Jesus Christ, you can \nthis night, if you please, with one drop of your blood, atone for my \nsins and appease the wrath of an angry God.\" He described the \ntransformation as instantaneous. Then he reckoned that \"the anger \nwrath and vengeance which I saw, was wholly in myself, by the hellish \nnature that I was possessed of.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was twenty-seven. Immediately, he began telling others about \nChrist. He felt a call to preach, but hesitated to do so, because he \nhad little education. Born in Rhode Island, he had migrated to Nova \nScotia with his parents at twelve years of age. After his conversion, \nhis ministry now took him across Nova Scotia and back into New \nEngland. Everywhere he went, he spoke of each person's need for a \nheart relationship with the resurrected Christ. The impact of his \nwords and life were so great that he became known as \"the Whitefield \nof Nova Scotia.\" (George Whitefield was a preacher who led revival in \nEngland and the American colonies.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry wrote hymns (more than 500 of them) some of which expressed his \nnew-found joy. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe pluck'd me from the jaws of hell\u0014\nWith his almighty arm of pow'r,\u0014\nAnd O! no mortal tongue can tell\u0014\nThe change of that immortal hour! \u0014\n\u0014\nHe also kept a journal which reported his intense religious \nexperiences. Throughout his short life, he swung between moods of \ndeep depression and heady joy. Consequently, his writings seem overly \nemotional. He taught some odd doctrines, too, about how souls are \ncreated and how the unseen world relates to this. But the heart of \nhis Gospel was sound and the spiritual awakening that he aroused was \nreal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe preaching of Henry and other \"New Light\" ministers produced \ncommunities of true worshippers. They became concerned for one \nanother's social needs. The result was that spiritual revival was \nfollowed by community improvement.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry contracted tuberculosis. Despite his illness, he worked \nunceasingly to spread the gospel. His efforts exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1784, he visited New England. On this day, February 2, 1784, while \nat the home of the Reverend David McClure in North Hampton, New \nHampshire, he died.

He \nstudied at the Westminster School for a while, but was sent to \nIreland in 1755, the same year as his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Toplady was taken with John Wesley's teachings, but by 1758, \nhe had become an extreme Calvinist and had harsh words for Methodist \ntheology. Passionate for the Lord, he prayed, \"God keep me from being \na mere scholar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady received his degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts \nfrom Trinity College. Ordained deacon in 1762, he was licensed to the \ncuracy of Blagdon the same year. Two years later he was ordained as a \npriest, and until 1766 served as curate at Farleigh, Hungerford. For \nthe next two years he held the benefice of Harpford with Venn-Ottery, \nand for two years after that, of Broad Hembury. During 1775 he took a \nleave to minister to the French Calvinist Reformed Church in Orange \nStreet, London.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first published work was Poems on Sacred Subjects, Dublin, 1759. \nHis major works were the Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of \nthe Church of England (1774) and The Church of England Vindicated \nfrom the Charge of Arminianism (1769.) He was prone to polemics and \nwas cutting in his opposition to Wesley followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady suffered from tuberculosis.

    "words": "Have you ever heard of the so-called Candelaria Massacre? This \nheinous crime took place one night in 1993 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \nThe tragedy involved the murder of 8 street children who were \nsleeping in a church doorway. In the trial 3 years later, 2 former \npolicemen were convicted. One was sentenced to 309 years in prison, \nreduced to 89 years after retrial (even though Brazil has a 30-year \nlimit on incarceration).\u0014\n\u0014\nSome suspected the crime was part of a plot by police officers to \nearn extra money from shopkeepers by getting rid of street children \nwho commit petty crimes against the merchants. However, the defendant \ntestified the killings happened because some children had thrown \nstones at a police car the previous day--as if that made the reaction \nexcusable.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory is full of cruel ironies, and here's the one in this story: \nthe name of the defendant given the 309-year sentence for killing the \neight children was Marcus Emanuel! A man whose surname means God \nwith us (Matthew 1:23) repeated the crime Herod had sought to commit \nagainst the true Immanuel--the baby Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe may not know the true reason for Marcus Emanuel's crime, but \nHerod's motive was clear. He was so intent on eliminating threats to \nhis kingship that he was willing to kill innocent infants to ensure \nhis continued rule. Such is the power of sin that Jesus came to \ndestroy. (5) We see the earnest yearning of the magi to worship the \nnew- born king. We see the cruelty of Herod's response.\u0014",

    "words": "How Pastors' Ponzis Affect Our Gospel Witness \u0014\nA rash of pastor-endorsed fraud taints our gospel witness \u0014\nA Christianity Today editorial | posted 4/13/2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nIt begins with a seemingly sincere offer of help from a trusted, \nJesus-loving voice. But the conversation always dead-ends in \nperdition.\u0014\n\u0014\nCase in point: The New Covenant Christian Center, a Seattle-area \nindependent church, was the setting where a tragically familiar Ponzi \nscheme took root in 2003. The scheme's organizer offered to double or \ntriple invested money in a matter of weeks through an overseas \ntrading program. In total, 24 church members handed over $1.6 million \nuntil law enforcement intervened in 2011 as the fraud collapsed. Who \nwas that trusted voice behind this Ponzi? Anthony C. Morris, the \npastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, Ponzi frauds that prey on the nave, innocent, and \ntrusting have lost billions. The Madoff Ponzi's price tag alone was \n$20 billion. In these schemes, the organizer offers a high return \nrate at low risk, but in reality he pays existing investors with \nfunds collected from new investors.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors have uncovered more financial fraud in church networks \nthan they ever imagined. \"It took the financial downturn. Money was \ndrying upthe new investors were not coming in, so Ponzi schemes \ncollapsed,\" IRS Special Agent in Charge for Criminal Investigations \nKen Hines told Christianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\nHines, based in Seattle, has helped expose Ponzis for more than 20 \nyears. He has seen first-hand how the church environment has proven \nto be an ideal context for affinity fraud. \"When you go to church, \nyou don't expect to get lied to or deceived or manipulated into \nlosing your life's savings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Covenant Ponzi was no isolated event. The stain of fraud that \nmay have started in the pew has now spread to the pulpit. More \npastors, elders, and other spiritual leaders are engaged in or \nendorse investments that later turn out to be Ponzis. Unfortunately, \nthere are too many examples to cite. \u0014\nHere are three:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn the Ukraine, Nigerian megachurch pastor Sunday Adelaja faces a \ncivil suit that he took a leadership role in the $100 million Kings \nCapital fund, which turned out to be a Ponzi. There are hundreds of \nvictims. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tUnder the sponsorship of pastor Eddie Long and New Birth Missionary \nBaptist Church near Atlanta, lay minister and business executive \nEphren Taylor persuaded church members to invest in City Capital \nCorp. for a \"guaranteed 20 percent return.\" But investors, who have \nfiled suit alleging a Ponzi scheme, may have lost more than $1 \nmillion. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA federal judge in Portland recently sentenced a former preacher, \nJohnny \"Mickey\" Brown, to almost 11 years in prison for a Ponzi fraud \nin which he misused the credit cards of mostly elderly church members \nand others. Losses may exceed $4 million. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sickening net effect of fraud puts a dark cloud over pastors and \nother leaders in local churches. Very few pastors will ever become \ncertified financial planners. The issue is honesty and integrity, not \ninvestment advice per se. If a faithful church member cannot trust \nhis or her own pastor, whom can they trust?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why when it comes to investment advice (not advice about the \nfamily budget or paying off your credit card debt) a pastor should \nstay two steps away from any investment plan under discussion. At the \npractical level, that means no endorsement or involvement of church \nor personal funds. Remove all appearances of conflict of interest so \nthat public trust can thrive.\u0014",

Over 1,500 people perished \nas \"the ship that not even God could sink\" sank. Only about a third \nof the passengers lived to tell of the nightmare.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the death toll was staggering, the greater tragedy was that \nmany more people could have been rescued. The Titanic was certified \nto offer lifeboat space to 1,178 people. But of the twenty lifeboats \nlowered overboard, only a few were filled to capacity. Several were \nless than half full. For instance, the first lifeboat lowered, boat \nseven, had room for 65 people, yet just 28 boarded. Boat five left \nwith 24 spaces unfilled. Lifeboat nine left with 26 out of 65 paces \nunfilled. Lifeboat one could accommodate 40 people but left the \nTitanic with only 12 people on board. In all, only 711 passengers and \ncrew were rescued, while 40 percent of the total lifeboat spaces \nremained unfilled. Meanwhile, hundreds of people floated in the open \nwater wearing life jackets near the twenty unfilled lifeboats. Only \none of the vessels went back in search of other survivors. The rest \n(with room to spare) remained at a safe distance observing the \nhorrific scene, comforting one another, and praising God they'd been \nspared.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the ensuing months, as investigators sought to determine why so \nmany lifeboat seats remained unfilled, they uncovered some startling \nmisperceptions. First, some of the Titanic crewman mistakenly assumed \nthat filling the lifeboats to their \"sea capacity\" would cause the \nboats to break in two during the lowering process. As a result of \ntheir excessive caution, many passengers were forced to plummet into \nthe icy waters. Secondly, some of the passengers were reluctant to \nboard the lifeboats because they didn't feel that there was an urgent \nneed. After all, the ship was supposedly \"unsinkable.\"\u0014",

He \nstudied at the Westminster School for a while, but was sent to \nIreland in 1755, the same year as his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Toplady was taken with John Wesley's teachings, but by 1758, \nhe had become an extreme Calvinist and had harsh words for Methodist \ntheology. Passionate for the Lord, he prayed, \"God keep me from being \na mere scholar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady received his degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts \nfrom Trinity College. Ordained deacon in 1762, he was licensed to the \ncuracy of Blagdon the same year. Two years later he was ordained as a \npriest, and until 1766 served as curate at Farleigh, Hungerford. For \nthe next two years he held the benefice of Harpford with Venn-Ottery, \nand for two years after that, of Broad Hembury. During 1775 he took a \nleave to minister to the French Calvinist Reformed Church in Orange \nStreet, London.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first published work was Poems on Sacred Subjects, Dublin, 1759. \nHis major works were the Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of \nthe Church of England (1774) and The Church of England Vindicated \nfrom the Charge of Arminianism (1769.) He was prone to polemics and \nwas cutting in his opposition to Wesley followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady suffered from tuberculosis. As his death neared, he sensed \nGod's presence. \"O what a day of sunshine this has been to me! I have \nnot words to express it. It is unutterable.

    "words": "February 2, 1784 \u0014\nHenry Alline, Evangelist to Nova Scotia\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nI do not wonder that it is so hard for you to keep up an external \nappearance of Christianity. It is a hard task without any divine love \nor heavenly life to produce it. Why try any longer to cover your \nnakedness with fig leaves...\" Henry Alline preached with this kind of \nfervor.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter years of desperate search, years in which he trembled that he \nwould be forever damned, Henry discovered the love of Christ in 1775. \nHe had cried out for mercy, saying, \"O Lord Jesus Christ, you can \nthis night, if you please, with one drop of your blood, atone for my \nsins and appease the wrath of an angry God.\" He described the \ntransformation as instantaneous. Then he reckoned that \"the anger \nwrath and vengeance which I saw, was wholly in myself, by the hellish \nnature that I was possessed of.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was twenty-seven. Immediately, he began telling others about \nChrist. He felt a call to preach, but hesitated to do so, because he \nhad little education. Born in Rhode Island, he had migrated to Nova \nScotia with his parents at twelve years of age. After his conversion, \nhis ministry now took him across Nova Scotia and back into New \nEngland. Everywhere he went, he spoke of each person's need for a \nheart relationship with the resurrected Christ. The impact of his \nwords and life were so great that he became known as \"the Whitefield \nof Nova Scotia.\" (George Whitefield was a preacher who led revival in \nEngland and the American colonies.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry wrote hymns (more than 500 of them) some of which expressed his \nnew-found joy. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe pluck'd me from the jaws of hell\u0014\nWith his almighty arm of pow'r,\u0014\nAnd O! no mortal tongue can tell\u0014\nThe change of that immortal hour! \u0014\n\u0014\nHe also kept a journal which reported his intense religious \nexperiences. Throughout his short life, he swung between moods of \ndeep depression and heady joy. Consequently, his writings seem overly \nemotional. He taught some odd doctrines, too, about how souls are \ncreated and how the unseen world relates to this. But the heart of \nhis Gospel was sound and the spiritual awakening that he aroused was \nreal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe preaching of Henry and other \"New Light\" ministers produced \ncommunities of true worshippers. They became concerned for one \nanother's social needs. The result was that spiritual revival was \nfollowed by community improvement.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry contracted tuberculosis. Despite his illness, he worked \nunceasingly to spread the gospel. His efforts exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1784, he visited New England. On this day, February 2, 1784, while \nat the home of the Reverend David McClure in North Hampton, New \nHampshire, he died. He was not quite thirty-six years old and had \npreached for just eight years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAlline, Henry. \"I Seek My Brethren.\" Sermon preached at Fort Midway \nin 1783.Decision (August 1975).\u0014\nAlline, Henry.

    "title": "HISTORIC GERMANTOWN PROTEST AGAINST SLAVERY",
    "words": "February 18, 1688 \u0014\nHistoric Germantown Protest Against Slavery\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe consciences of individual Christians have often placed them at \nodds with the behavior of their neighbors. The trail to civil rights \nwas blazed by Christians, especially those who belonged to minority \nsects. In the Americas, Quakers frequently took the lead. That was \ntrue on this day, February 18, 1688, when four Quakers in Germantown, \nPennsylvania wrote a protest against enslavement of blacks. This is \nknown as the Germantown Protest.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four men were Garret Hendericks, Derick up de Graeff, Abraham up \nden Graef and Francis Daniell Pastorius. Pastorius struggled to word \nthe protest in passable English. Its principle argument, based on the \ngolden rule, was that Christians should do as they would want to be \ndone by. Did capture by Turks frighten whites? In the same way, \ncapture by whites frightened black people. Would whites fight for \ntheir freedom? Then blacks had the same right.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother moral objection to slavery was its nature as theft. It is \njust as wrong to buy goods you know are stolen as it is to steal the \ngoods yourself. Were not blacks stolen and brought to America against \ntheir will? Pastorius pointed out that many of those who would read \nhis argument enjoyed freedom of conscience in Pennsylvania for the \nfirst time in their lives. They had fled Europe to escape intolerance \nthere. Why then would they oppress blacks in the same hateful manner \nin which they had been oppressed?\u0014\n\u0014\nAdultery is wrong. Yet slavers forced adultery on men and women by \nbreaking up marriages when they resold husbands and wives to \ndifferent owners. How could such actions be condoned by Christians? \nThe bad report of American slavery shocked the conscience of Europe \nand kept potential immigrants away. Slavery was not an exercise of \nChristian liberty, but desperate wrongdoing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Germantown protest was written for presentation to a larger \nmonthly meeting to be held at \"Richard Worrell's place.\" Although \nmany German-speaking Quaker and Moravian communities in Pennsylvania \nand surrounding states stoutly refused to own slaves, others ignored \nPastorius's words and joined their secular neighbors in the dreadful \nhuman traffic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Germantown Protest was lost and not rediscovered for 144 years, \njust before the Civil War, when demands for the abolition of slavery \nwere at their height. What misery the United States would have been \nspared if men had listened to the moral warning issued by the four \nGerman-speaking men in 1688. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBacon, Margaret A.

Layne (aslayne) \u0014\nSubject: Special story\u0014\nSent: Friday, June 01, 2012 3:25 PM\u0014\n\u0014\nBronson (a senior) is one of the students whom I took to the State \nFBLA competition in Reston. He is also going to Nationals. \u0014\n\u0014\nBronson placed 1st in the Management Information Systems team (MIS) \non the Regional level, but his family could not afford for him to go \nto States. So I found the money for him. He showed up at States with \nborrowed dress clothes from friends, but he did not have a suit coat \n(or a belt) for the State competition. I borrowed a coat from another \nstudent but it didnt match great and was too long. His team placed \n1st at States in spite of this. So now his team can go to Nationals, \nso I told him he must have a suit, belt and dress shoes for Nationals \n(b/c we got graded down on professional appearance.) We were going \nto check the Goodwill stores, etc. When cleaning out Shanes closet, \nI found his chorus tux that he had in 8th grade. (Bronson is really \nshort and small boned.) So I brought the suit, a brand new shirt and \n2 belts (1 black and 1 brown) to Bronson. They all fit except for the \nlength of the pants. So I asked another teacher (who sews) if she \ncould hem the pants. She did.\u0014\nHe ended up wearing the suit/tux to the prom and will wear it to \nNationals in San Antonio, Texas, in June. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere is a very sweet note that I received from him. (These are few \nand far between but this is what makes teaching (and FBLA) worth all \nthe work!) \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Mrs. Layne,\u0014\nThank you very much for all that youve done throughout the year, \nfrom persuading me to join FBLA to making it possible for me to go \nthe tournaments, to providing an excellent-looking suit for my prom \nnight; you have also been a great teacher to me. Honestly if it \nwerent for your help I would have no idea what an MIS is nor would I \nhave ever experienced going to the prom. You have enabled me to gain \nthe memories of winning my first trophy ever, attending a high school \ndance, having a fun trip with friends in Reston, and in the future \nhaving an even more exciting trip in San Antonio, and for that I am \ntruly grateful.\u0014\n\u0014\nSincerely,\u0014\nBronson\u0014",

    "words": "Colors of the Mind \u0014\n\u0014\nHaskin 6/20/12\u0014\n\u0014\nAs has been the custom the last few years, I spent Preakness day as \nguest of Thoroughbred owner Lee Einsidler in the International \nPavilion in the infield, just a stones throw from the finish line \nand the Preakness winners circle.\u0014\n\u0014\nI mention this only because of an odd piece of memorabilia I took \nhome with me  a cloth napkin from our table. The reason I \nconfiscated it was equally as odd. The napkin was white with red \npolka dots; virtually identical to the Belair colors of William \nWoodward and later his daughter Edith W. Bancroft.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose colors are ingrained in the memory and still evoke images and \nfeelings of a time long gone; of innocence, and the unbridled joy of \nvictory, and the gut-pounding sadness of defeat, and butterflies in \nthe stomach.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are the colors of Damascus, the horse who started it all; who \nthrust me into a world I never knew existed; one of grace and beauty \nand boundless thrills. Boy, do I appreciate a horse like him today; a \nhorse held together by sinews of steel, who raced 16 times at 3; who \nwon at 10 different distances from six furlongs to two miles; who set \ntrack records under heavy imposts; who won the equivalent of 12 grade \nI stakes; who set a track record at Aqueduct under 130 pounds while \nmaking this third start in 16 days, all carrying 130 pounds or more; \nand whose intervals between races at 3 were 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 week, \n2 weeks, 3 weeks, 10 days, 3 weeks, 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 16 \ndays, 26 days, 28 days, and 2 weeksand he actually got stronger as \nthe year went on.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Damascus who breathed life into a hollow existence, numbed \nfrom years of toiling mindlessly on Wall Street.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts been 45 years since that life-altering encounter with Damascus \nand Thoroughbred racing, and those colors still get to me. In fact, \nracing to a spellbound neophyte was a tapestry of colors  a \nkaleidoscope of rich hues and intricate patterns. I can still see \nthem. The red silks and tartan sash of Dr. Fager. The black silks and \nred cap of Buckpasser. The dark grey silks, yellow braid, and yellow \nsleeves of Arts and Letters. The black and gold stripes of Majestic \nPrince. And the brown and white silks and Running W of Gallant Bloom. \nThey were as identifiable as the noble steeds beneath them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt amazed me that more than four decades later even a simple cloth \nnapkin could rekindle those early flames and inspire the very words \nand feelings I now find myself expressing. Yes, its all about colors.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have considered myself a friend of Paul Reddams for a number of \nyears, but I no longer will be able to look at his white and purple \ncolors that were once taken for granted and not see Ill Have Another \ncharging down the stretch in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. It was \nthose same colors that illuminated the Empire State Building on the \nThursday night before the Belmont Stakes. Yes, its all about colors, \nfrom golden chestnuts to blacks and bays, and dappled grays and the \nfamiliar colors they carried to victory.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy now, most of you must be wondering why I am writing this. The \ntruth is, I havent the slightest idea. It is 1:53 a.m., the Triple \nCrown has already begun to fade into memory, and after five months of \nraging Derby and Triple Crown fever, the door to the decompression \nchamber is slowly beginning to open. Im just not ready to enter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm not ready to say goodbye for good to Ill Have Another. Im not \nready to let go of Bodemeister, Paynter, Dullahan, and Creative Cause \nuntil the summer. So, I look at my cloth napkin folded up on my \nbookcase and it becomes a portal to the past, unleashing a tidal wave \nof nostalgia, back to when a milkshake was something I drank at my \ncorner candy store; when detention was for juvenile delinquents, not \nhorses; when the word positive was positive; when the New York \nTimes actually covered racing as a sport; when twitter was something \nI heard from the sparrows outside my window.\u0014\n\u0014\nI realize this little journey into the past is only temporary, and my \nthoughts will soon turn to the Stephen Foster and Royal Ascot. But \nwhats wrong with having a cathartic moment now and then?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what better inspiration than Damascus, and, of course, Dr. Fager \nand Arts and Letters and all those other horses who beckoned me to \nenter a new world that would sustain and nurture me the rest of my \nlife?\u0014\n\u0014\nHey, what did you expect at two oclock in the morning, Socrates?\u0014\n\u0014\nCome to think of it, Socrates described the depth of observing even \nthe simplest of objects, like a cloth napkin, a lot better than I \never could.

    "title": "HOW HIGGS BOSON POSITS A NEW STORY OF CREATION",
    "words": "How the Higgs Boson Posits a New Story of our Creation\u0014\n\u0014\nJuly 9, 2012 , Newsweek\u0014\n\u0014\nThe media-adopted name for the Higgs Boson, believed to be discovered \nthis week, couldnt be more misleading. Lawrence M. Krauss explains \nhow the particle could finally dispense with the idea of a \nsupernatural creator. Plus, cosmologist Sean Carroll on how the \ndiscovery will revolutionize physics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been a lot of hoopla since the July 4 announcement by the \nEuropean Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) that the two largest \nexperiments at the Large Hadron Collider had uncovered evidence for a \nnew elementary particle. The particle in question appears to be the \nHiggs particle, which scientists have been seeking for almost 50 \nyears and is at the heart of our current best theory of nature. But \nthe real excitement seems to stem from the fact that this long-sought \ndiscovery is frequently called, in colloquial circles, the God \nparticle. This term appeared first in the unfortunate title of a \nbook written by physicist Leon Lederman two decades ago, and while to \nmy knowledge it was never used by any scientist (including Lederman) \nbefore or since, it has captured the medias imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat makes this term particularly unfortunate is that nothing could \nbe further from the truth. Assuming the particle in question is \nindeed the Higgs, it validates an unprecedented revolution in our \nunderstanding of fundamental physics and brings science closer to \ndispensing with the need for any supernatural shenanigans all the way \nback to the beginning of the universeand perhaps even before the \nbeginning, if there was a before. The brash notion predicts an \ninvisible field (the Higgs field) that permeates all of space and \nsuggests that the properties of matter, and the forces that govern \nour existence, derive from their interaction with what otherwise \nseems like empty space. Had the magnitude or nature of the Higgs \nfield been different, the properties of the universe would have been \ndifferent, and we wouldnt be here to wonder why. Moreover, a Higgs \nfield validates the notion that seemingly empty space may contain the \nseeds of our existence. This idea is at the heart of one of the \nboldest predictions of cosmology, called inflation. This posits that \na similar type of background field was established in the earliest \nmoments of the big bang, causing a microscopic region to expand by \nmore than 85 orders of magnitude in a fraction of a second, after \nwhich the energy contained in otherwise empty space was converted \ninto all the matter and radiation we see today! Alan Guth, the \noriginator of the theory, called it the ultimate free lunch.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf these bold, some would say arrogant, notions derive support from \nthe remarkable results at the Large Hadron Collider, they may \nreinforce two potentially uncomfortable possibilities: first, that \nmany features of our universe, including our existence, may be \naccidental consequences of conditions associated with the universes \nbirth; and second, that creating stuff from no stuff seems to be \nno problem at alleverything we see could have emerged as a \npurposeless quantum burp in space or perhaps a quantum burp of space \nitself. Humans, with their remarkable tools and their remarkable \nbrains, may have just taken a giant step toward replacing \nmetaphysical speculation with empirically verifiable knowledge. The \nHiggs particle is now arguably more relevant than God.\u0014",

    "words": "HOW HORSE-WHISPERER \nTRAINS WILD HORSES\u0014\n\u0014\nLong before the \"dog whisperer,\" Cesar Milan, there was the \"horse \nwhisperer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMonty Roberts was raised in the horse business. He learned there was \none way to train horses: by \"breaking\" them. Through domination and \nforce, which at times included striking the horse with whips or even \ntying and suspending the horse's feet and legs, a trainer would \nimpose his will upon the animal until it reached the conclusion that \ntotal submission was the only way to survive.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his early teen years Roberts began to study the behavior and \ncommunication patterns of wild mustangs in the badlands of Nevada. He \ntook note of the nonverbal communication among the horses . Drawing \non this observation and his firsthand experience with horses, Roberts \ndeveloped a breakthrough training technique he first called \"hooking \non\" as opposed to \"breaking down\" the horse's will. This new training \nmethod was based on a cornerstone concept he eventually trademarked \ncalled JoinUp. Join-Up not only stopped the \"breaking\" norms of \ntraditional horse training, it showcased how to cooperate with the \nhorse's own spirit, innate ways, and means of communicating as a \nmember of the herd.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe personality and full potential of the horse emerge through loving \nfreedom and desire rather than domination . The Join-Up technique \ninvites an untamed horse that has never been ridden to willingly \naccept the saddle, bridle, and rider. It is a thing of beauty to \nwatch. Monty Roberts enters a round pen with a wild horse. In as \nlittle as half an hour, he'll be riding the horse.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoberts creates an atmosphere of mutual respect that communicates, \n\"I'm not going to hurt you, and you don't have to follow me if you \ndon't want to.\" After a brief period of introducing himself and \ninteracting with the horse  Roberts turns his back to the animal and \nwalks away.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point the horse trains her eyes on Monty with all-out \nintensity and attention. She is asking herself, \"Where is he going?\" \nand \"Do I want to stay by myself?\" The horse must choose: \"I want to \nbe with you. I want to join up and follow you on the way.\" She \nquickly decides, \"My safe place is with you.\" Dropping her head \n(equine language for \"I submit to you\") and trotting to Roberts's \nside, the horse says, \"I choose to follow. I want to be with you.\"\u0014",

Across the \nworld, from Lagos to Manila, from Calcutta to Managua, garbage \ncollecting became one of the fastest-growing occupations of the \ntwentieth century. In the larger cities, such as Mexico City or Lima, \nwhole communities of thousands of people not only spend their lives \nworking the garbage, but they live in the garbage dumps in order to \nbe close enough to grab the best of the refuse as soon as it arrives. \nThe dumps of Mexico City have grown so large that in some areas they \nreach nearly two hundred feet in depth, as deep as a twenty-story \nbuilding is tall.\u0014\n\u0014\nHumans compete with dogs and vultures for the food. I learned from \nyears of travel in poor countries that one could easily judge the \nprosperity of a town by the vultures at the garbage dumps; only \nprosperous communities had the luxury of throwing away enough food to \nsustain such scavengers.

In \none of his last articles, he wrote about some profound discoveries. \nAn excerpt reads as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe priest came and gave me Communion at my hospital bed. I felt a \nwarmth around my head. He prayed a spontaneous prayer, and I felt \ntransformed. I'm still trying to understand what happened. I grew up \nCatholic and went to Catholic school for twelve years. I was \nhumiliated by nuns, hated the folk rock mass, disagreed with Rome on \nissues, and after graduating from high school, I left the church. I \nwent to church for weddings and funerals. But then, at forty, death \napproached my door. A priest at St. Joseph's Hospital was in the \ndoorway. I said, \"Father, I need Communion.\" On Monday, the priest \narrived and gave me Communion and said another prayer. He laid his \nhands on any stomach and prayed as he had before. And I felt a state \nof bliss. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther remarkable things happened. My mother had an unusual spiritual \nexperience while praying for me that week. Four people I had not \ntalked with for nine years called me one day, wishing me well. So \nhere is what I think happened. Call it God, or love. Maybe it's the \nsame thing. But a wave of energy moved through this priest, who \nuttered the most beautiful prayer I've ever heard. I told a doctor \nabout my experience. He said, \"When a patient has a spiritual \nawakening, he or she gets better.\" I still have cancer. But what the \npriest did most of all was remove my fears and anxieties, like a \nsurgeon removing a tumor. And he pumped the blood of faith into me.  \nCited in Robert A.

    "title": "HAVE WE GOTO HEAVEN ALL WRONG?",
    "words": "N.T. Wright asks: Have we gotten heaven all wrong? \u0014\n\u0014\nBy John Murawski \u0014\nThursday, May 17, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nNEW YORK (RNS)The oft-cliched Christian notion of heavena blissful \nrealm of harp-strumming angelshas remained a fixture of the faith \nfor centuries. Even as arguments will go on as to who will or won't \nbe saved, surveys show that a vast majority Americans believe that \nafter death their souls will ascend to some kind of celestial resting \nplace. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut scholars on the right and left increasingly say that comforting \nbelief in an afterlife has no basis in the Bible and would have \nsounded bizarre to Jesus and his early followers. Like modern \ncurators patiently restoring an ancient fresco, scholars have plumbed \nthe New Testament's Jewish roots to challenge the pervasive cultural \nbelief in an otherworldly paradise. \u0014\n\u0014\nAntonio da Correggio's The Assumption of the Virgin, painted in \n16th century Italy, depicting heaven with ranks of angels and saints. \n(Photo/Wikimedia Commons) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most recent expert to add his voice to this chorus is the \nprolific Christian apologist N.T. Wright, a former Anglican bishop \nwho now teaches about early Christianity and New Testament at \nScotland's University of St. Andrews. Wright has explored Christian \nmisconceptions about heaven in previous books, but now devotes an \nentire volume, How God Became King: The Forgotten Story of the \nGospels, to this trendy subject. \u0014\n\u0014\nWright's insistence that Christianity has got it all wrong seems to \nmark a turning point for the serious rethinking of heaven. He's not \njust another academic iconoclast bent on debunking Christian myths. \nWright takes his creeds very seriously and has even written an \n800-plus-page megaton study setting out to prove the historical truth \nof the resurrection of Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a very current issuethat what the church, or what the \nmajority conventional view of heaven is, is very different from what \nwe find in these biblical testimonies, said Christopher Morse of \nUnion Theological Seminary in New York. The end times are not the \nend of the worldthey are the beginning of the real worldin biblical \nunderstanding. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the appearance of a recent cover story in Time magazine \nsuggests that putting-the-heaven-myth-to-rest movement is gaining \ncurrency beyond the academy. Wright and Morse say they have both made \npresentations on heaven research at local churches and have been \nsurprised by the public interest and acceptance. \u0014\nAn awful lot of ordinary church-going Christians are simply millions \nof miles away from understanding any of this, Wright said. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristian apologist N.T. Wright's insistence that Christianity has \ngot it all wrong seems to mark a turning point for the serious \nrethinking of heaven. (RNS photo courtesy HarperOne) \u0014\n\u0014\nWright and Morse work independently of each other and in very \ndifferent ideological settings, but their work shows a remarkable \nconvergence on key points. In classic Judaism and first-century \nChristianity, believers expected this world would be transformed into \nGod's Kingdoma restored Eden where redeemed human beings would be \nliberated from death, illness, sin and other corruptions. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis represents an instance of two top scholars who have apparently \ngrown tired of talk of heaven on the part of Christians that is \nneither consistent with the New Testament nor theologically \ncoherent, said Trevor Eppehimer of Hood Theological Seminary in \nNorth Carolina. The majority of Christian theologians today would \nrecognize that Wright and Morse's views on heaven represent, for the \nmost part, the basic New Testament perspective on heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst-century Jews who believed Jesus was Messiah also believed he \ninaugurated the Kingdom of God and were convinced the world would be \ntransformed in their own lifetimes, Wright said. This inauguration, \nhowever, was far from complete and required the active participation \nof God's people practicing social justice, nonviolence and \nforgiveness to become fulfilled. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the Kingdom is complete, he said, the bodily resurrection will \nfollow with a fully restored creation here on earth. What we are \ndoing at the moment is building for the Kingdom, Wright explained. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, doing God's Kingdom work has come to be known in Judaism as \ntikkun olam, or repairing the world. This Hebrew phrase is a close \ncousin to the ancient beliefs embraced by Jesus and his followers, \nWright said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's the recovery of the Jewish basis of the Gospels that enables us \nto say this, Wright said. We are so fortunate in this generation \nthat we understand more about first-century Judaism than Christian \nscholarship has for a very long time. And when you do that, you \nrealize just how much was forgotten quite soon in the early church, \ncertainly in the first three or four centuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity gradually lost contact with its Jewish roots as it \nspread into the gentile world. On the idea of heaven, things really \nveered off course in the Middle Ages, Wright said. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur picture, which we get from Dante and Michelangelo, particularly \nof a heaven and a hell, and perhaps of a purgatory as well, simply \nisn't consonant with what we find in the New Testament, Wright said. \nA lot of these images of hellfire and damnation are actually pagan \nimages which the Middle Ages picks up again and kind of wallows in. \u0014\n\u0014\nWright notes that many clues to an early Christian understanding of \nthe Kingdom of heaven are preserved in the New Testament, most \nnotably the phrase your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, \nfrom the Lord's Prayer. Two key elements are forgiveness of debts and \nloving one's neighbor. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile heaven is indisputably God's realm, it's not some distantly \nremote galaxy hopelessly removed from human reality. In the ancient \nJudaic worldview, Wright notes, the two dimensions intersect and \noverlap so that the divine bleeds over into this world. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther clues have been obscured by sloppy translations, such as the \npopular John 3:16, which says God so loved the world he gave his only \nson so that people could have eternal life. \u0014\n\u0014\nWright offers a translation that radically recasts the message and \nshows how the passage would have been heard in the first century. To \nhear it today is to experience the shock of the new: God gave his son \nso that everyone who believes in him should not be lost but should \nshare in the life of God's new age. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it's not a Platonic, timeless eternity, which is what we were \nall taught, Wright said. It is very definitely that there will come \na time when God will utterly transform this worldthat will be the \nage to come. \u0014\n\u0014\nReligious Herald, 6/11/12\u0014",

He worked hard, applied himself well, became a major \ngeneral in the Civil War, a leader in congress, and finally president \nof the United States. He was ambidextrous--he could write with both \nhands. But Garfield was unique in that he could write Greek with one \nhand and Latin with the other -- both at the same time. That's hard \nto believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Charles Charlesworth was born on March 14, 1829 in \nStaffordshire, England. His first years were uneventful.  At the age \nof four, however, little Charles sprouted whiskers and reached sexual \nmaturity. Aging rapidly over the next three years, Charles developed \nvaricose veins, white hair, shriveled skin, and the gait and posture \nof a man ten times his age. One day in his seventh year, Charles \nfainted and died. The unusual child had died of natural causes. The \ncoroner ruled it was merely old age. That's hard to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Every tourist to the historic city of Florence, Italy is \ntaken to the Cathedral of Florence (Santa Maria del Fiore.)  I have \nbeen there. The builder left a small opening in the dome just large \nenough to permit the passage of a thin beam of light. A small metal \nplate was set in the floor of the sanctuary, under the dome. \nAccording to the architect's design, the beam of light passing \nthrough the opening in the dome should fall exactly on the metal \nplate June 21st of every succeeding year, and it does, every year on \nJune 21st, and no other time. That's hard to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1the \nstory is told of a three year old who began playing the harpsichord \nand played with astounding skill. In fact, his ear was so sensitive \nthat it could detect a deficiency of even an eighth of a note in the \ntuning of a violin -- when he was three years old.\u0014\n\u0014\n        This same child at five years old came home one day when his \nfather and some other skilled musicians were practicing. The second \nviolinist had failed to show up, and this five year old, although he \nhad never seen the music before, played the violin part as if he had \nbeen practicing for weeks. His father and the other men were \nastonished, but the little boy said, \"You don't have to practice to \nplay second violin, do you?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n        This same young boy wrote two minuets when he was five years \nold. When he was seven, he wrote a sonata, and incomprehensible \nthough it is, when he was eight he wrote a complete symphony, a major \npiece of music, writing all of the parts for all of the instruments \nin the orchestra.\u0014\n\u0014\n        In Rome, once a year during Holy Week, the Misere by Giorgio \nAllegri was performed by the papal choir. It was so beautiful the \nPope had forbidden its performance anywhere else in the world, and \nthe only copy of the score in existence had been jealousy guarded in \nthe papal vaults. A decree issued by the Vatican prohibited anyone \nfrom reproducing this work in any form. Transgression was to be \npunished by excommunication.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The Misere was a long, complex composition. This young boy we \nhave been discussing heard it played once.  Returning to his room, he \ntranscribed the entire score from memory. Instead of being \nexcommunicated, the Pope bestowed on him the Cross of the Order of \nthe Golden Spur.  Is that hard to believe? That comes close to being \nincomprehensible. That boy I've been telling you about died in 1791 \nat 35 years of age. Many of you know who I am talking about -- \nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the greatest musical genius the world has \never known. He is hard to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n        One final story. You've heard of child prodigies?  But not \none like this one. Christian Freidrich Heinecken was born in Luebeck, \nGermany in 1721. Within eight weeks of his birth, Christian was \nspeaking intelligible German. At the age of one, he read the \nPentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) with ease. The next \nyear, between the ages of two and three, he familiarized himself with \nthe entire Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. Do you understand \nme?  I'm talking about a two-year-old.\u0014\n\u0014\n        In his third year, Christian devoted himself to the study of \nhistory and geography and learned to read both French and Latin. Word \nof the boy's unbelievable intellect swept Europe, and the King of \nDenmark invited Christian to demonstrate his acumen at the royal \nresidence in Copenhagen--at three years old.\u0014\n\u0014\n        As powerful as Christian's intelligence was, his body was \namazingly weak. His tiny fingers lacked the strength to even grasp a \npen, and he was utterly unable to eat solid food. At the age of four, \nlittle Christian predicted his imminent death, and, unfortunately, he \nwas exactly correct.  That's hard to believe!  Walking on water seems \nmild in comparison to that.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED---WALTER WILLIAMS",
    "words": "Having been born in 1936 has allowed me to witness both societal \nprogress and retrogression. High on the list of things made better in \nour society are the great gains in civil liberties and economic \nopportunities, especially for racial minorities and women. People who \nare now deemed poor have a level of material wealth that would have \nbeen a pipe dream to yesteryear's poor. But despite the fact that \ntoday's Americans have achieved an unprecedented level of prosperity, \nwe have become spiritually and morally impoverished compared with our \nancestors.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago, spending beyond one's means was considered a character \ndefect. Today not only do people spend beyond their means but also \nthere are companies that advertise on radio and TV to eliminate or \nreduce your credit card and mortgage debt. Students saddled with \ncollege loans have called for student loan forgiveness. Yesterday's \nAmericans would have viewed it as morally corrupt and reprehensible \nto accumulate debt and then seek to avoid paying it. It's nothing \nless than theft. What's worse is there's little condemnation of it by \nthe rest of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this year, as a result of a budget crunch, the Philadelphia \nSchool District had to lay off 91 school police officers. During the \n1940s and '50s, I attended Philadelphia schools in poor \nneighborhoods. The only time we saw a policeman in school was during \nan assembly period when we had to listen to a boring lecture about \nsafety. Because teacher assaults are tolerated -- 4,000 over the past \nfive years in Philadelphia -- school police are needed. Prior to the \n'60s, few students would have thought of talking back to a teacher, \nand no one would have cursed, much less assaulted, a teacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nI couldn't have been more than 8, 9 or 10 years old when one time, on \nthe way home from school, my cousin and I were having a stone fight \nwith some other youngsters. An elderly black lady walked up to my \ncousin and me and asked, \"Does your mother know you're out here \nthrowing stones?\" We replied, \"No, ma'am,\" praying that the matter \nrested there. Today an adult doing the same thing risks being cursed \nand possibly assaulted. Fearing retaliation, adults sit in silence as \nyoung people use vile language to one another on public conveyances, \nin school corridors and on the streets.\u0014\n\u0014\nYesteryear there was little tolerance for the kinds of crude behavior \nand language that are accepted today. To see a man sitting on a bus \nor trolley car while a woman is standing used to be unthinkable. \nChildren didn't address adults by their first name. By the way, over \nthe course of my nearly 45 years of teaching, on several occasions, \nstudents have addressed me by my first name. I have told them that I \ndon't mind their addressing me by my first name but that my first \nname is Professor.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of what's accepted today would have been seen as bizarre and \nlowdown yesteryear. Out-of-wedlock childbirth was a disgrace and \nsurely wouldn't have occasioned a baby shower. Popular TV shows such \nas \"The Jerry Springer Show\" and \"Maury\" feature guests who openly \ndiscuss despicable acts in their personal lives, often to the \napplause of the audience. Shame is going the way of the dinosaur.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou say, \"Williams, you're just old-fashioned and out of touch with \nmodern society.\" Maybe so, but I think that a society's first line of \ndefense is not the law but customs, traditions and moral values. \nThese behavioral norms -- transmitted by example, word of mouth, \nreligious teachings, rules of etiquette and manners -- represent a \nbody of wisdom distilled over the ages through experience and trial \nand error. They include important legal thou-shalt-nots -- such as \nshalt not murder, steal, lie or cheat -- but they also include all \nthose civilities one might call ladylike or gentlemanly behavior. \nPolice officers and courts can never replace these social restraints \non personal conduct. At best, laws, police and the criminal justice \nsystem are a society's last desperate line of defense.\u0014",

    "title": "HAVE MERCY ON ME",
    "words": "\u0014\n\"Have mercy on me!\" the blind beggar Bartimaeus cries out repeatedly \nwhen he hears that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. Bartimaeus \nrefuses to be silent even when many people rebuke him. He states his \nrequest and he receives his sight. Instead of going away, he follows \nJesus in the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nComparison of this account with the redacted texts in Matthew \n20:29-34 and in Luke 18:35-43 indicates how freely the Matthean and \nLukan writers changed this story. The sequence of events is basically \nthe same in all three accounts, but in Matthew instead of one beggar \nnamed Bartimaeus there are two blind men sitting along the path where \nJesus was walking and in Luke the blind man was encountered as Jesus \nwas entering the city of Jericho rather than as he was leaving it. \nThis is consistent with the other redactions of Markan material by \nthe Matthean and Lukan writers. The Matthean redactors often \nmagnified the Markan stories, doubling the number of blind men given \nsight here, doubling the number of animals on which Jesus rode into \nJerusalem, and increasing the speed and magnitude of the miraculous. \nThe Lukan writer often \"pruned\" some of the details from the Markan \naccounts and added other details. Our analysis of the changes made in \nthe redactions from Mark to Matthew and from Mark to Luke indicate \nthat it is very likely that even greater changes would become \napparent if we would be able to reach back beyond Mark to the \npre-Markan level of oral and written development of this and of other \naccounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point of this Mark 10:46-52 text, of course, is not in the number \nof blind men who were given sight or in whether they called upon \nJesus as he was entering the city of Jericho or as he was leaving it. \nThe point of these accounts is that those who are blind called upon \nJesus to have mercy on them and that Jesus, with the power of God, \nhad mercy on them. That is the message of this Mark 10:46-52 account \nfor us also.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW LINCOLN DESCRIBED HIMSELF",
    "words": "OF All THE WORDS A PROUD, AMBITIOUS MAN MIGHT USE TO DESCRIBE \nHIMSELF, PERHAPS ONLY Abraham Lincoln would choose strange. Yet there \nit is. In one of his earliest wisps of autobiography, Lincoln wrote \nthat he was \"a strange, friendless, uneducated, penniless boy\" when \nhe emerged from the back-woods in his early 20S to make his way in \nthe world. Editors of Lincoln's Collected Works found the word so \nperplexing that they added an r to transform him into a mere \nstranger. But the late David Herbert Donald, one of Lincoln's most \nadmired biographers, astutely recognized that the man meant what he \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\nStrange can mean odd or quirky, and Lincoln was certainly that. His \nfoes nicknamed him the Gorilla, which captures his long-armed, \nshambling animal strength. His hands and feet were enormous, and his \nbrow was simian. Yet when he spoke, a high and reedy voice twanged \nforth incongruously. At one moment, he might be braying loudly over \none of his own salty jokes, and at the next, lost in catatonic \nsilence. \u0014\n\u0014\nStrange can also mean unfamiliar, alien. This too is Lincoln, who \nnever quite fit in. The youthful Lincoln was a rawboned genius on an \nuncomprehending frontier. As President, he was a self-taught rustic \nsurrounded by the polished burghers of Eastern society. Magnetic, \nkeenly sensitive, often able to understand others better than they \nunderstood themselves, Lincoln was nevertheless profoundly \u0014\nisolated. Perhaps the early deaths of his mother and sister steeped \nhim in sorrow so thoroughly that he learned to prefer loneliness to \nintimacy. He \"never had a confidant,\" his law partner William Hern- \u0014\ndon wrote. \"He was the most reticent and mostly secretive man that \never existed.\" Despite interviewing dozens of Lincoln's associates in \nthe months after his death, J.G. Holland, an early biographer, found \nhimself stumped. \"There are not two who agree in their estimate of \nhim,\" he wrote. One would \u0014\nsay \"he was a very ambitious man\"; another would assert \"  \u0014\n\u0014\n\"People said that \"he was one of the saddest men that ever lived, and \nthat he was one of the jolliest men that ever lived ... that he was a \nman of indomitable will, and that he was a man almost without a will; \nthat he was a tyrant, and that he was the softest-hearted, most \nbrotherly man that ever lived.\" The real Lincoln, Holland concluded, \nwas the sum of his contradictions. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis shape-shifting quality has allowed writers and politicians of \nevery stripe to claim or reject Lincoln. He has been extolled as the \nGreat Emancipator and criticized as a racist, praised as the hero of \nfree \u0014\nlabor and denounced as a tool of industrialists. Lionized as a man of \npeace and lambasted as a warmonger, beloved for his \"new birth of \nfreedom\" and berated for his offenses against civil liberties and \nsmall government. Today he is philosophical soulmate to Presidents \nfrom both ends of the spectrum: George W. Bush quoted him last year \non the 10th anniversary of the 9/II attacks, while Barack Obama \nnamechecked him as recently as the first debate. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut his strange contradictions were essential to his political \nsuccess. Though he once declared that he \"was a party man and did not \nbelieve in any man who was not,\" Lincoln was, in important ways, al- \u0014\nways a party of one. He had an unusual ability to look at things \nthrough the eyes of his critics as well as his friends. He was \nwilling to turn the same cold gaze on himself, to appreciate the \nlimits of his popu- \u0014\nlarity, which he studied closely because popularity is the wellspring \nof power. Once, an angry critic of the confounding George McClellan \ndemanded to know why Lincoln tolerated the Union general's \u0014\ninsubordinate behavior. Lincoln coolly replied that McClellan was \"a \nmajority general,\" while he was but \"a minority President.\" That \nmakes all the difference in a government of, by and for the people. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is tempting in times of great political strife and division-like \nLincoln's and our own  to pinje for leaders who transcend politics. \nBut the success of the roth President teaches that hard times are \nprecisely \u0014\nwhen political dexterity is needed most. Politics is the machinery by \nwhich we meet tough challenges. Lincoln drilled this idea into his \nclosest aides so thoroughly that they could channel his philosophy \nafter he was gone. \"Every war is begun, dominated and ended by \npolitical considerations,\" explained John Nicolay and John Hay, \nLincoln's faithful secretaries. \"War and politics, campaign and \nstatecraft, are Siamese twins, inseparable and interdependent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe created the transcontinental railroad, the modern fiscal system, \nthe homesteading movement and the nation's land-grant universities. \n\"Never has there been a moment in history when so much was all \ncompressed into a little time,\" one U.S. Senator observed. And never \nsince the founding of the country had so much depended on the \npolitical skills of one man. \u0014\n\u0014\nONE LESSON: IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM. Lincoln never confused his mission \nwith himself. He had the hide of a rhinoceros and a rare ability to \nset the past aside when turning former enemies into allies. His \nfavorite expression, according to Hay, was \"I am in favor of short \nstatutes of limitations in politics.\" To Lincoln, a grudge was a \nwaste of resources. If a person could be useful, it mattered little \nwhether he was friend or foe.\u0014\n \u0014\nThere is no better example than his decision in January 1862 to \nentrust leadership of the War Department to Edwin Stanton, a \nprominent Pennsylvania attorney. Years earlier, Lincoln had been \u0014\nretained as one of several lawyers helping defend a manufacturer of \nreaping machines against the powerful McCormick Co. in a patent \ndispute. Stanton was the star of the defense team, and he went to \u0014\ngreat lengths to humiliate Lincoln when the case went to trial. \nCalling him \"that damned long-armed ape,\" Stanton refused to seat \nLincoln at counsel's table. All that was forgotten when Lincoln went \nlooking for a man brazen and hard enough to perform the thankless \ntask of bringing order \u0014\nto the vast Union war machine. \u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln also teaches the lesson of patience. Hardly a day passed in \n1862 without an exasperated lecture from someone about the need to \ntake bold steps against both slavery and McClellan, yet Lincoln \nresisted. He needed to move gradually, to persuade himself and \nmoderate voters of the North that he had exhausted all incremental \nsteps. Even after he decided that the general must be fired and the \nslaves freed, he waited for the right political moment. His \nsecretaries described this excruciating period. He \"grew sensitive \nand even irritable,\" wrote Nicolay and Hay.\u0014\n\u0014\nTIME, 11/5/12\u0014",

    "words": "November 14, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nHospital Death in Ireland Renews Fight Over Abortion\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DOUGLAS DALBY\u0014\n\u0014\nDUBLIN  The death of a woman who was reportedly denied a potentially \nlifesaving abortion even while she was having a miscarriage has \nrevived debate over Irelands almost total ban on abortions. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman, Savita Halappanavar, 31, a dentist who lived near Galway, \nwas 17 weeks pregnant when she sought treatment at University \nHospital Galway on Oct. 21, complaining of severe back pain. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Halappanavar was informed by senior hospital physicians that she \nwas having a miscarriage and that her fetus had no chance of \nsurvival. However, despite repeated pleas for an abortion, she was \ntold that it would be illegal while the fetuss heart was still \nbeating, her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not until Oct. 24 that the heartbeat ceased and the remains of \nthe fetus were surgically removed. But Dr. Halappanavar contracted a \nbacterial blood disease, septicemia. She was admitted to intensive \ncare but never recovered, dying on Oct. 28. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Halappanavar, in an interview with The Irish Times from his home \nin India, said his wife was told after one request, This is a \nCatholic country. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo investigations into the case have been announced, and politicians \nhave been quick to express their condolences and to call for legal \nclarity. Kathleen Lynch, a junior health minister, said medical \nprofessionals needed guidelines to deal with such circumstances. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a statement, the hospital said it would cooperate fully with any \ninquest but that it had not started its own review because it wanted \nto consult the womans family first. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Halappanavar told the newspaper that he still could not believe \nhis wife was dead. I was with her those four days in intensive \ncare, he said. They kept telling me: Shes young. Shell get over \nit. But things never changed; they only got worse. She was so full \nof life. She loved kids. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was all in their hands, and they just let her go. How can you let \na young woman go to save a baby who will die anyway? \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Halappanavar said he saw no use in being angry. Ive lost \nher, he said. I am talking about this because it shouldnt happen \nto anyone else. \u0014\n\u0014\nMedical professionals were less forgiving. During a miscarriage, the \ncervix is opened, exposing the woman to infection, and the longer the \nmiscarriage persists, the greater the risk, said a prominent medical \ncommentator here, Dr. Muiris Houston. While Dr. Halappanavars death \nwas on the rare end of the spectrum, and the facts surrounding the \ncase are not all known, Dr. Houston said, she undoubtedly needed to \ngo to theater, meaning to surgery. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf she had gone to theater earlier she might still have died, but \nperhaps not, he said. Medicine is now increasingly driven by \nguidelines, and the question must be, Did the hospital have \nprotocols in place when a woman presented with such a condition?  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe legal issues are, if anything, more clouded. In 1992, the Irish \nSupreme Court ruled that abortion was permissible in cases where \nthere was a real and substantial risk to the life of a pregnant \nwoman  including the possibility of suicide. But 20 years later, the \nIrish government has still not passed a law to this effect. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland was in \nviolation of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to \nprovide an accessible and effective procedure to ascertain whether a \nwoman qualified for a legal abortion. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn response, the current coalition government commissioned a report \nfrom an expert group on the issue. It was initially expected in July, \nbut was then postponed until September  a deadline also missed. \nGiven the divisiveness of the abortion issue in Ireland, which has \nprompted two bitterly fought referendums, successive governments have \navoided passing any legislation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report was eventually delivered Tuesday night, hours before news \nbroke of Dr. Halappanavars death. The government warned people not \nto link the two, but inevitably the death has led to calls for urgent \nreform.\u0014",

In nearby Frundsberg Castle, they \ntortured him and priests examined him about infant-baptism. Hans said \nthat according to scripture, a man had to \"hear, understand, believe, \nand receive\" God's word before being baptized. As he saw it, this \nalone counted as Christian baptism. Children need not be baptized and \nthe Lord did not command it because they were already his. He might \nhave added, as he had written--and was now demonstrating-- that \"the \nChristian life is not child's play; but bitter earnestness, truth, \ncourage and saintliness must be there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked on what foundation the Anabaptists rested, he replied, \n\"Our faith, actions, and baptism rest on nothing else than the \ncommandment of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHans was known as a master of prayer. On the day he was arrested, he \nhad been teaching his hearers about prayer. Two months later, on the \nnight before his execution (his head was cut off), he was still \nfocused on prayer. He wrote a last letter to his flock; it was \nsmuggled out of the castle and preserved for us\u0014",

    "words": "Hark! The Herald Angels Didnt Sing\u0014\nBy T. M. LUHRMANN  Stanford, CA   New York Times\u0014\nDecember 13, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nWe are in Advent, but over the transom has come the sobering news \nthat Image Books has just published a book written by the pope, \nJesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives, in which he observes \nthat there was neither an ox nor a donkey in the stable where Jesus \nwas born. Nor did a host of angels sing. They spoke. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the news is not so grim. This is not an encyclical; the pope \nis writing as Joseph Ratzinger. It turns out that he tolerates, even \nencourages, the presence of lowing animals in the manger. He writes: \nIn the Gospel there is no reference to animals at this point. But \nprayerful reflection, reading Old and New Testaments in the light of \none another, filled this lacuna at a very early state by pointing to \nIsaiah 1:3: The ox knows its owner, and the ass its masters crib, \nbut Israel does not know.  A few pages later, the pope explains \nthat Christianity has always understood that the speech of angels is \nactually song. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the clear point of the book  and of the biographical trilogy \nthat this volume completes  is that Roman Catholics should know what \nthe Gospels say about Jesus and stick to it. They should not be \ndistracted by popular myth, or even by historical scholarship. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical Christianity is supposed to cleave to the text even more \nexactly. Most evangelicals describe the Bible as literally true. Yet \nfor many, literally often means keep whats there and add details \nto make it vivid. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am an anthropologist, and in recent years I have been exploring a \nkind of American evangelical Christianity that seeks to enable its \nfollowers to know God intimately. These evangelicals talk about the \nBible as if it is literally true, but they also use their imagination \nto experience the Bible as personally as possible. They talk about \ngetting to know God by having coffee with God, or asking God what \nshirt they should wear in the morning. A man from Horizon Christian \nFellowship in San Diego told me that the Bible is a love story, and \nit is written to me. It is a style of evangelical Christianity with \nmany followers: perhaps a quarter of all Americans. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis freedom to elaborate with your own imagination appalls many \nother evangelicals. They say that the Gospels demand that you know \nwho God actually is. As Albert Mohler, president of the Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary, explained to me on his radio show, My \nfirst concern is not with the God we are looking for, but the God who \nis. He thinks that the imagination drifts quickly away from what he \nwould call truth. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am no theologian and I do not think that social science can weigh \nin on the question of who God is or whether God is real. But I think \nthat anthropology offers some insight into why imaginatively \nenriching a text taken as literally true helps some Christians to \nhang on to God when they are surrounded by a secular world. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, this way of knowing God involves what social scientists would \ncall active learning. These evangelical churches invite worshipers \nto enter Scripture with all their senses. Here, for example, Richard \nFoster, a popular theologian, explains how to live the experience \nof Scripture: Smell the sea. Hear the lap of water against the \nshore. See the crowd. Feel the sun on your head and the hunger in \nyour stomach. Taste the salt in the air. Touch the hem of his \ngarment. To Christian critics of these practices, they are a \ndistortion of the Scripture, because they add to the text more than \nis actually there  your own memories of a summer by the seaside, the \nfeel of heavy robes. To a social scientist, these practices ask that \nthe learner engage in the most effective kind of learning: hands on \nand engaged. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, these practices make the experience of God personally \nspecific. Vivid, concrete details help people to get caught up in a \nworld that is not the one they see before them  and the more \nparticular the details, the more powerful the involvement. Richly \ndescribed settings  Narnia, Middle-earth, Hogwarts  become places \nthat people can imagine on their own. Of course someone like J. K. \nRowling might be horrified that readers have written tens of \nthousands of stories that carry on the lives of her characters, just \nas some evangelicals are horrified by other evangelicals who cozy up \nto God over a beer and chat with him in their minds. But social \nscience suggests that details like these do make what must be \nimagined feel more real. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhich position you take depends on whether you are more worried about \nheresy or atheism. The pope and Albert Mohler are concerned that \nChristians get God right. They fear that congregants in these \nexperientially oriented churches will imagine God in a way that \ninadvertently violates Scripture and leads them astray (God might \nbecome wholly loving, for example, and not at all judgmental). \u0014\nThe pastors of the more experiential churches are worried that people \nwill not get God  period. They see more people unaffiliated with \nchurches than ever: one-fifth of American adults, a third of all \nAmerican adults under 30. They use these techniques to help to make \nGod more compelling to people. \u0014\nThe nonobvious point for secular readers is that a commitment to the \nliteral truth of the Bible can be an intensely creative process. It \ncaptures your attention. It demands that you work to make the text \ncome alive. For people who want to keep their faith but harbor \ndoubts, or even for people who are merely aware of the doubts of \nothers, that can make all the difference.\u0014",

Althoff  [ posted 12/7/2012  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jordan enrolled in Wheaton College in Illinois, he wouldn't \nadmit to himself that he was attracted to other men. Raised in a \nconservative Baptist church and a student at a conservative Christian \ncollege, Jordan (who asked that his real name not be used) hesitated \nto identify with the gay community, which he perceived as flamboyant \nand sex-obsessed. He attempted to ignore what was in opposition to \nhis Christian beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would sit in Wheaton's prayer chapel, staring at the cross, and \nbeg God to please just let me be attracted to girls,\" Jordan said. \"I \nused to pray for it every day: 'Heal me!'?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJordan waited for a chapel series at college, a sermon at the \nAnglican church he attended, or a fateful meeting with that one \nperson who would change his orientation. \"I just thought I'd \nnaturally be attracted to a girl and get marriedeveryone says that's \nwhat happens,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen that didn't happen, Jordan was faced with the dilemma of \naddressing his same-sex attraction as a student at a school that \nprohibits any sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage. \nJordan and others like him point to the recent experience of Wesley \nHill, a Wheaton alum, professor at Trinity School for Ministry in \nAmbridge, Pennsylvania, and author of Washed and Waiting, as one \nexample of a gay Christian's choice to live in celibacy to address \nsame-sex attraction.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaders at Christian colleges and universities around the country \ntold Christianity Today their schools are rethinking the way they \naddress the needs of these students on campus. Recently, Wheaton's \nadministration provided forums for dialogue about human sexuality and \nencouraged students to be more open about their experience. \"I'm very \nhopeful for the current climate at Wheaton,\" said dean of student \ncare Melanie Humphreys. \"There is always someone wrestling with this. \nBut they need to feel a sense of communitythis issue won't be \nresolved at arm's length.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents from several Christian colleges who spoke with CT said \nbehavioral codes, which often forbid homosexual behavior in addition \nto alcohol and tobacco consumption, sex outside of marriage, and \nerotic dancing, inhibit their ability to be open about their sexual \nstruggles or experiences. They fear disciplinary probation and being \nostracized by peers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I enrolled as a freshman, I would never have said I was gay,\" \nJordan said. \"I wanted to keep it quiet for fear of my guy friends \nbeing freaked out by me. You hear gay jokes around campus and you're \nafraid if you come out people will look at you differently.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJordan often felt lonely during his four years at Wheaton, but \ninsisted his experience was positive overall, especially after he \nmade the decision to reveal his struggles with gay porn and same-sex \nattraction to his discipleship group and some professors, \nadministrators, and close friends.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I first came out to my small group, they laid hands on me, \nprayed for me, thanked me for confessing deep, dark things, and said \nthey'd be there to support me as I struggled through it,\" Jordan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months after graduation, he was faced with the challenge of \ncoming out to his parents. \"When those words came out of his mouth, I \ntruly felt like I'd been gut punched,\" said Jordan's mom.

Wade, this is where we find \nourselves. While most of us have strong opinions on abortion, the \npolitical framing of the issue remains polarizing and unable to fully \ncommunicate what we believe and feel. We've become strangely \ndisconnected from such an important issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince we don't often think, talk or pray about abortion outside of \npolitics, we also can't expect much to change. The survey results led \nme to ask: Is God calling his people to move beyond a political \nplatform on abortion and offer a complete expression of his heart?\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians agree that God creates all life, beginning at \nconception. Psalm 139:13-18 paints a vivid picture of a loving God \nbeing intimately involved in forming each of us, with a specific plan \nfor our lives. He could have chosen to bring us into the world in any \nnumber of ways, but his design is pregnancy. Pregnancy has to be a \nmajor part of our theology when we look at abortion. It's a time and \nan experience like no other: for nine months, the welfare of the \nchild and the woman are intertwined. Everything done to one impacts \nthe other.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical platforms fail offer a complete expression of God's heart \nbecause each side chooses one individual's needs to focus on. \nPro-life focuses mainly on the needs of the child. Pro-choice focuses \nmainly on the needs of the woman. God wants to meet the needs of \nboth. We must engage in work that addresses the needs of child and \nmother, creating an environment that supports both during and after \nunplanned pregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nA single woman often experiences an identity shift during an \nunplanned pregnancy that leaves her believing she has become \"that \ngirl.\" Research at the pregnancy center I lead in Chicago shows how a \nsingle woman expects shame and judgment on such a scale that life as \nshe knows it will be over. She feels she either has to have an \nabortion to try and become herself again, or she has to resign \nherself to overwhelming struggle as a single mom.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe've also found that when we show grace to a woman facing an \nunplanned pregnancy, when we offer acceptance and support, it can \nchange the way she thinks about herself, her future, and the future \nof her child. There's not a lot of grace in our culture for a single \nwoman who gets pregnancy unexpectedly. The standard wisdom is that \nshe has just wrecked her life, de-railed her future. And yet we \nexpect these women to go ahead and have their babies without outside \nsupport?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've heard accounts from single women whose churches would not hold \nbaby showers for them when they were faced with unplanned \npregnancies. A Christian response of grace, acceptance and support \nwould look more like this:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe can acknowledge that pregnancy is not a sin. Rather, sex outside \nthe context of marriage is the sin. We can also acknowledge that many \nmore Christians are engaged in sexual immorality, including \npornography, than just women who get pregnant. We must talk about our \ntheology of sexual purity all the time and with everyone involved, \nnot just women facing unplanned pregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe then can apply grace. We all need God's forgiveness through the \nblood of Christ, and grace offers us the path towards transformation \nthrough the power of the Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe can commit to supporting women, both emotionally and \npractically, regardless of whether the pregnancy is planned or \nunplanned. This can include holding baby showers, counseling a woman \nthroughout the pregnancy, or reaching out to single moms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we don't know of any women facing unplanned pregnancy in our \nchurches or in our lives, it may be because they are afraid to admit \nthe pregnancy. According to data from the National Campaign to \nPrevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 30 percent of unmarried \nevangelical women ages 18-29 have experienced an unplanned pregnancy. \nAnother study reports that 32 percent of unplanned pregnancies among \nself-identified evangelicals end in abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we talk about unplanned pregnancy and abortion through the lens of \ngrace and acceptance, we can create a culture where women won't feel \nthey have to end a pregnancy because of the shame they fear they will \nexperience within their faith community.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Christians step in and offer a countercultural message of \nradical acceptance, miracles happen:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Instead of asking me what I was going to do  that's what everyone \nwas asking me  she said, 'What do you need?' When she started giving \nme resources, I didn't feel alone anymore.\" \"I can't believe all \nthese people give money, give baby items  just for us. It makes me \nwant to do better, knowing people believe in me. Like I have more \nhope because they have hope for me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians, we don't have to settle for the limitations of \npolitics. We don't have to rely on government alone to bring about \nsocial change. We're holding a key much more powerful than any \npolitical platform. We are in relationship with the Savior, who came \nto \"bind up the brokenhearted, proclaim freedom for the captives... \ncomfort all who mourn, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of \nashes\" (Isaiah 61:1-3).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus can give us a Christian response to unplanned pregnancy and \nabortion that transcends the political debate. He can give us \nsolutions to work for the dignity and welfare of both the woman and \nthe child.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we first ask the pregnant women in our groups if they would \nconsider going to a church for support, they almost always say \nabsolutely not. Here are a few comments we've heard recently:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I know what the people of the church will think of me; I don't need \nto be around that\" \"I don't want to hear about religion; that just \nmakes you feel worse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut after they see Christians demonstrate God's love by donating \nitems, volunteering with our organization, or opening the doors of \ntheir churches, women start to take a different view.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was like, 'Who does all this for pregnant women?' When I found out \nit was people associated with a faith, it made me want to check out \nchurch for the first time.\" \"My perception of Christians has changed \nsince coming here. I used to have a negative opinion, but now I think \nI would consider going to church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis year on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, instead of simply being \nvocal in the political debate, we can ask God to overwhelm us with \nhis heart of compassion. Instead of focusing on people we disagree \nwith, we can turn our attention to making ourselves and our churches \nmore supportive for women facing unplanned pregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's grace has completely transformed my life, and it's God's love \nthat motivates me to want the best outcome for every woman and child \nimpacted by unplanned pregnancy. That's one thing all Christians can \nagree on, whatever our politics. God can show us how to bring light \nand healing into an issue that's been broken for way too long.\u0014\n\u0014\nAngie Weszely is director of Caris, a faith-based pregnancy \ncounseling organization in Chicago.\u0014",

    "words": "How 3 Alabama Churches United for Their Community\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Gary Furr           Thursday, February 21, 2013  \u0014\n\u0014\nWe decided together to join our congregations in a project to work \nwith a school where our resources, both money and people, could be \nlent in a spirit of love to help children, Furr writes.\u0014\nSeveral years ago, I was approached about participating in a program \nwhere pastors might become friends across differences  race, age and \ndenomination  and learn from each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Arthur Price and I decided to make that journey together. He is \nthe pastor of historic Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, \nAla., where, 50 years ago this fall, people driven by hate and fear \nset off a bomb that killed four little girls who had just prayed \ntogether. The episode set off a national revulsion to the radical \nracists and helped put America in a new direction.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of that few years, we became friends: Arthur much \nyounger, a different personality and a native of the North, me a son \nof the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was one of the richest experiences of my life, and it is \ndocumented on the Resource Center for Pastoral Excellence website.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the side blessings of that friendship was connecting our \nchurches. We visited each other's deacons' meetings, had our \ncongregations together for fellowship, and continued our friendship \nby having breakfast together regularly over the years.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, we began to talk together about doing something positive \nthat would mark this anniversary by affirming that we are in a new \nday and that the faith community is part of that. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother friend, Rev. Keith Thompson of First United Methodist Church \nin downtown Birmingham, joined us.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the massacre at Newtown, Conn., in December, our sense of \ncommitment was heightened. Whatever strikes at our children, \ncollectively, hits the deepest reaches of our soul as a nation.\u0014\nWhile we wrangle over gun control and mental health, it is important, \nwe felt, to find something to do. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe decided together to join our congregations in a project to work \nwith a school where our resources, both money and people, could be \nlent in a spirit of love to help children and bear witness to a \ndifferent one than the ignorant and fearful one of 50 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe settled on the Epic School in Birmingham. It is a wonderful school \nwith many high-achieving students, but it also faces many challenges.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts able principal told us that it has by far the highest population \nof special needs children, nearly one-third of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe met with the principal and only asked one question: \"How can we \nhelp your school?\" What unfolded was a list of needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have agreed to contribute two members from each of our churches to \nserve as a liaison committee to meet and coordinate and publicize our \nefforts. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe will have an initial volunteers-interest meeting with everyone \nfrom the three churches and then our members will have the chance to \nvolunteer talents, skills and abilities to help with after-school \nprograms, athletics, tree planting, resources for classrooms and so \non.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also plan for our congregations to join together on Good Friday to \nworship together. Arthur suggested we call it, \"Good Friday in Black \nand White.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat more significant joining of Christians can there be than on that \nday at the heart of our faith, where misunderstanding, hate and sin \nwere crucified, according to our faith, by God Himself?\u0014\n\u0014\nOur hope is not only that we will help out a school, but that our \ncongregations might develop new friendships from another part of town \nand enlarge our worlds.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks ago, my church voted unanimously, and enthusiastically, I \nmight add, to participate. \u0014\n\u0014\nReconciliation is not an implication of the Christian gospel; it is \nat the heart of that gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is an old bluegrass gospel song by Carl Story that says, \"If \nyou hate your neighbor, then you don't love God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSome things are debatable, but that one isn't. We are standing up for \nlove. Change begins with the acceptance of some responsibility that \nis ours to take.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlabama is more than 1963. We are a beautiful state with wonderful \npeople. I read that we are sixth in the nation in total volunteer \nhours.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of us would like the bombing to be something that is remembered \nas a turning point, not a defining image of us. It won't change until \nwe replace it with another one.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy prayer is that this year, in 2013, it will be the image of the \nfaith communities of our state, and tens of thousands of our \ncitizens, joining hands to get involved in schools, getting to know \nneighbors, solving problems where we are and being reconciling love \nfor our nearest neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy prayer is that when Alabama is mentioned, it will no longer spark \njokes about our poverty or our past, but that they might say, \"How \nthey love one another!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Furr is pastor of Vestavia Hills Baptist Church in Birmingham, \nAla.\u0014",

    "words": "Burma\u0014\nHorror at Sea: Adrift for Months, Starving Asylum Seekers Threw 98 \nBodies Overboard\u0014\nBy Emily RauhalaFeb. 19, 2013 Time Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThirty-two asylum seekers rescued by the Sri Lankan navy say they \nwent without food for 21 days and were forced to throw dozens of dead \noverboard after their wooden vessel failed at sea. The survivors, who \nidentified themselves as Muslims from near the Burma-Bangladesh \nborder, told local officials that they set out to seek refuge in \nIndonesia or Australia, but instead spent two months languishing on \nthe water. By the time they were plucked from the sea, theyd thrown \n98 bodies to the waves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nightmare of shipwreck may sound like a relic of another time, \nbut what happened off the coast of Sri Lanka this week is alarmingly \ncommonplace. The U.N. estimates that at least 13,000 people fled the \nborderlands between Burma and Bangladesh by boat in 2012. Of them, \n485 are known to have drowned. This deadly tide looks unlikely to \nrecede: at least 1,800 refugees washed up in Thailand in January 2013 \nalone.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy risk the waves? Many of the asylum seekers are ethnic Rohingya \nMuslims, a group the U.N. identifies as among the most isolated and \noppressed in the world. Though many Rohingya have lived along the Bay \nof Bengal for generations, some 800,000 are stateless, sandwiched \nbetween Burma and Bangladesh, welcome in neither. The Burmese \ngovernment has never recognized them as part of the patchwork \nnations 135 indigenous ethnic groups and, over the years, has \nrestricted their right to live, work and marry. In June 2012, the \nreported rape of a Buddhist woman in Arakan (Rakhine) state sparked a \nwave of communal violence that left at least 78 dead and tens of \nthousands displaced. An August report by Human Rights Watch said \nBurmese security forces did little to stop the violence and committed \nacts of murder, rape and forced displacement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the months since that violence, the conflict has lingered on, with \nmany ethnic Rohingya left to wait indefinitely in squalid camps. In a \ndispatch published yesterday, TIME contributor Jason Motlagh, \noutlined how conditions have deteriorated:\u0014\n\u0014\nEight months on, pockets of Rohingya that remain in rural Arakan \nstate are in serious trouble. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced \nin early February that its field teams continued to face hostile \nthreats from Arakanese leaders and state forces that forced them to \ncut back medical care. Moreover, the aid agency warned of a brewing \nhumanitarian emergency in the heavily restricted camps around \nSittwe. Burmese officials claim the camps are necessary to shield the \nRohingya population from further harm, but MSF says that acute \nmalnutrition, skin infections and other ailments caused by poor \nsanitation are on the rise, especially among those uprooted by a \nsecond spasm of violence in October and now live on the margins of \nestablished camps.\u0014",

In addition, such Christians \nwere more likely to agree when asked whether \"pastors (74%), \nphotographers (72%), and rental halls (57%) should be able to refuse \nsame-sex involvement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to LifeWay Research president Ed Stetzer, most Americans \nsupport the right of \"'individuals such as clergy or photographers to \ndeny services for same-sex marriage. ... However, the level of \nagreement changes with scenarios that could be interpreted as more \nbasic rights such as housing and employment.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's the breakdown for Americans in general:\u0014\n\u0014\n63 percent agree and 27 percent disagree that pastors should be \nallowed to refuse to officiate same-sex weddings if they are made \nlegal in their state; 58 percent agree and 33 percent disagree that \nphotographers should be allowed to refuse to work same-sex weddings \nif they are made legal in their state; 40 percent agree and 52 \npercent disagree that rental halls should be allowed to refuse to \nrent out their facilities for same-sex weddings if they are made \nlegal in their state; 27 percent agree and 67 percent disagree \nlandlords should be allowed to refuse to rent housing to same-sex \ncouples if same-sex marriage is made legal in their state; 14 percent \nagree and 82 percent disagree employers should be allowed to refuse \nemployment to someone based on their sexual preference.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy comparison, 39 percent of conservative Christians agree landlords \nshould be able to refuse same-sex involvement, and 19 percent say the \nsame for employers.\u0014\n\u0014\nCT previously has reported on same-sex marriage, noting in December \nthe Supreme Court's decision to rule on the constitutionality of \nCalifornia's Proposition 8 and Defense of Marriage Act. In 2009, CT \nweighed in with an editorial saying the debate over same-sex marriage \n\"shouldn't drive [Christians] to outrage or panic,\" and reported in \n2011 and 2012 on the shifting 'marriage battleground' and political \nopinion among evangelical\u0014",

    "words": "Heroes  Ordinary People Focused on Something Better \u0014\nColin Harris\u0014\nJanuary 21, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe commemorative holidays that we celebrate this month and next \ninvite us to remember the contributions of national heroes whose \nlives represent the values we aspire to as a people. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. are \nicons in our collective memory, and but a few of the lives by which \nwe identify ourselves as Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington, and his colonial colleagues, embraced a vision of a new \nkind of republic. At considerable risk to themselves, they broke free \nfrom restrictions in order to formulate and implement that vision, of \nwhich we are grateful heirs.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln, illuminated recently in both book and film, struggled to \nkeep a nation from being rent asunder by the issue of slavery and \nhelped to move through bloody conflict to a resolution of the issue \nthat could move the country beyond it.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing, in word and deed, called on his nation to \"live out the true \nmeaning of its creed\" by offering a vision that would liberate both \noppressed and oppressor from the bondage of racial discrimination.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn honoring these, we underscore the features of our better selves \nthat can lead us toward wholesome community on all levels. \"Show me \nwhat you praise,\" Socrates said, \"and I'll tell you what kind of \npeople you are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeneath the honor we so naturally ascribe, however, the bright light \nof historical study reveals that these larger-than-life icons were \nactually people of their own time, who, in some cases, reflected \nthoughts and behaviors that later generations would see as \ninconsistent with the goals they sought.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe, for example, were \nthemselves slave owners, revealing that their noble thoughts about \nall men being created equal did not really mean \"all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent attention to Lincoln has suggested that the \"great liberator\" \nshared a measure of the racism that was part of his world.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlawed heroes? Perhaps all are because culture's cloak is worn not \nonly by those who seek to perpetuate its status quo but also by those \nwho call us beyond it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking to a church group a number of years ago, Dean Rusk, who had \nserved as U.S. Secretary of State from 1961-69, observed: \"In all my \nyears of working with national and world leaders, I never met a \nsuperman. All I knew were ordinary people responding to the \nextraordinary challenges of everyday life on the world stage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis words suggest that what we see and embrace as greatness is not so \nmuch the innate presence of extraordinary capability, but a \nwillingness, in the time and place of one's circumstances, to step up \nand to speak and act on behalf of a horizon beyond the present one.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerfection is not a prerequisite, it would seem. Thus, honoring \ngreatness in any of its forms is probably wise when tempered with a \nrealistic awareness that our heroes are indeed real people.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, it is often observed that the Apostle Paul accepted the \ninstitution of slavery and the subordination of women as part of the \nworld he lived in.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, in that context he sowed the seeds of a new level of \nrelationship that led to a reshaping of that kind of thinking: \"There \nis neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female; for you \nare all one in Christ Jesus\" (Galatians 3:28).\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, Martin Luther King Jr. was thought by some of his \ncontemporaries to be too much of a \"gradualist\" in the quest for \nracial liberation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his concern for the liberation of both oppressor and oppressed \nand a reconciliation between them, held up for all the concept of the \n\"beloved community\" as more than an exchange of power.\u0014\n\u0014\nPraise tempered by realism not only protects us from \nover-romanticizing our icons, it also enables us to see and affirm \nthe heroic in our ordinary companions on life's journey. Such as:\u0014\n\u0014\n? The school teacher who sees possibility in a marginal (or \nmarginalized) student and helps build the confidence base to work \ntoward it.\u0014\n\u0014\n? The business owner who commits to integrity and service more than \nprofit.\u0014\n\u0014\n? The community leader or politician who puts a vision for the common \ngood above self or the group who finances his campaign.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the ordinary people who are responding to the extraordinary \nchallenges of everyday life.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeroes, known and unknown, seem to be persons who believe in horizons \nbeyond the ones they can see, and who devote their lives to building \nplatforms from which others can see them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe materials for building these platforms are closer than the \nnearest lumberyard and are within reach of each of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps our commemorative holidays, in addition to recognition of \nworthy honorees, are an invitation to the task.\u0014\n\u0014\nColin Harris is professor of religious studies at Mercer University \nand a member of Smoke Rise Baptist Church in Stone Mountain, Ga.\u0014",

    "words": "History of Sunday Laws\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished in the January/February 2013 Liberty Magazine by Melvin M. \nBelli\u0014\n\u0014\nThe history of Sunday legislation in the United States shows a mass \nof contrary, inconsistent, and illogical cases and distinctions. The \nfollowing instances help to prove this: \u0014\n\u0014\nIn State of Nebraska v. Tim O'Rourke, 35 Nebr. 614, 1892, an \nindictment for playing baseball on Sunday, the court said: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No trial can be had on Sunday. The only trials which a lawyer can \nthen lawfully be subjected to are those which he undergoes in \nlistening to the clergy who make him a frequent object of reproach. \nThe only permissible court on that day is such as lovers, according \nto immemorial custom, pay to the object of their adoration.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFined for Upholding Sunday Law\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Massachusetts in 1816 it cost Officer John Atwood just $500 for \nupholding the Sunday law that made illegal either riding or traveling \ndone on the Lord's day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Jonathan Dwight was shocked to see George Pearce riding on Sunday \n\"against the peace and the dignity of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts.\" He rushed to the nearest magistrate, and a warrant \nwas issued on his complaint. The warrant was given to Officer Atwood \nto serve on Pearce, and the officer, seeing his duty, took the \nlawbreaking criminal into custody that same Sunday. In fact, he \nlocked him in the local jail from Sunday noon until Monday morning. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Monday morning Pearce became plaintiff, not defendant, and sued \nthe officer for false arrest. First, he explained to the court that \nthe local magistrate had jurisdiction to order the arrest of only \nthose of his own county who rode on Sunday. He was from another \ncounty. \u0014\n\u0014\nNext he showed the court another statute that prevented any work or \nbusiness on Sunday except \"works of charity or necessity.\" Since the \narrest was certainly not a work of charity, and since Pearce was well \nknown and would have been available for arrest the following day, his \nincarceration was not a work of necessity. \u0014\n\u0014\nDamages to the amount of $500 were awarded against the perplexed \nofficer. (13 Mass. 324.) \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch Loses a Donation \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Methodist Episcopal Church of Sweetster Station, Indiana, had \nfavored Sunday legislation until the Supreme Court of Indiana in 1878 \nwas called upon to interpret a Sunday law, with that church as \nplaintiff. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefendant Catlett, after listening to a soul-stirring sermon by the \nchurch pastor, had emerged into the sunlight of a new day. There was \nthe love of fellow man in his heart, and he determined to show his \nappreciation in a material way. He subscribed then and there to the \nchurch building fund. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the effect of the sermon had worn off, Catlett resumed the \nerrors of his ways and refused to pay his subscription. When sued by \nthe church for breach of contract, he called attention of the court \nto the Sunday law, so heartily subscribed to by the preacher, that \nupon the Sabbath one shall not work or conduct business of the any \nsort. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn effect the Supreme Court of Indiana said the contract was illegal \nbecause it was made on Sunday; therefore, the church could not \ncollect.\u0014\n\u0014\nForcing Men to Attend Church \u0014\nGeorge Washington, in his diary under date of November 8, 1789, \nrefers to a journey through Connecticut, and tells of the effect of \nthe state Sunday law upon him: \"It being contrary to the law and \ndisagreeable to the people of this state to travel on the Sabbath \nday, and my horses, after passing through such intolerable road, \nwanting rest, I stayed at Perkin's Tavern (which, by the way, is not \na very good one) all day; and a meetinghouse being within a few rods \nof the door, I attended the morning and evening services and heard a \nvery lame discourse from a Mr. Bond.\"\u0014\nSome modern advocates of enforced Sunday rest claim that if places of \nworldly amusement are closed on Sunday, men will attend church \nservices and thus be benefited. Washington's comment concerning the \ntype of sermon he heard leaves the conclusion inevitable that forcing \nmen to attend church cannot force them to be interested in what the \npreacher has to say. It is well known that most of the world's \ngreatest preachers have not only not had the support of the civil \nauthorities, but many of them have also had the active opposition of \nthe civil powers. \u0014\nIn an early Florida case (10 Fla. 558), authority is cited for the \nproposition that Sunday extends but from dawn on Sunday to sunset the \nsame day; therefore, jury deliberation held between midnight Saturday \nand sunrise Sunday is not illegal on Sunday, since it is still \nSaturday! \u0014\nWhat Is a Sunday Law? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn California in 1858 a Sunday law was construed as an intent to \nenforce as a religious institution the observance of a day called \nsacred by the followers of one faith, and was therefore declared \nunconstitutional because it was a discrimination in favor of one \nreligious profession. (Ex parte Newman, 9 Cal. 502.) \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a lengthy 1882 decision the Supreme Court of California held the \nSunday-closing law constitutional, saying, \"By virtue of her \nsovereignty, the State has guaranteed freedom of religious opinion \nand worship to all religious bodies and people within her boundaries. \nBut in granting those guaranties, she did not relinquish to religious \nbodies, nor divest herself of the power to establish a day of rest as \na municipal institution for the people of the state. That power was \nreserved to be exercised over all the members of the body politic, \nwithout reference to whether they are Christians or Hebrews, \nfollowers of Confucius, of Gautama Buddha, of Muhammad, or of Joe \nSmith; or those who say in their hearts, \"There is no God.\" Subject \nto that reservation, every citizen of the state is left free to his \nintellectual convictions and emotional fervors upon subjects of the \nunknown and unknowable. All are equal in the laws, in positions under \nthe law, and in the administration of the government. No legal \ndistinction or discrimination can be made between them. But, thus \nprotected, all are subject to the municipal institutions established \nby the State. And in establishing a day of rest as one of those \ninstitutions, the State has the right to determine what day ought to \nbe observed by the people.The duty of observing the day is imposed on \nthe people of the state as members of the body politic, without \nreference to the religious faith and worship of any.\" (Ex parte Koser \n60 Cal. 177.) \u0014\n\u0014\nLegislative Inconsistency \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Ex parte Jentsch, California held a Sunday-closing law, exclusive \nto barbers, unconstitutional. The supreme court there substituted its \njudgment as to the real purpose of the law for that of the \nlegislative, saying (page 474), \"How comes it that the legislative \neye was so keen to discern the need of the oppressed barber, and yet \nwas blind to his toiling brethren in other vocations\" Steam-car and \nstreetcar operatives labor through long and weary Sunday hours; so do \nmill and factory hands. There is no Sunday period of rest and no \nprotection for the overworked employees of our daily papers. Do these \nnot need rest and protection? The very suggestion of these \nconsiderations shows the injustice and inequality of this law.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Sunday Laws Today? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case of Justensen's Food Stores, Inc., v. City of Tulare et \nal., the Supreme Court of California in its ruling said: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We do not perceive by what process of reasoning the conclusion is \nreached that restaurants, confectioneries, dispenser of beverages, \nand other excepted businesses dealing in food for human consumption, \nshould be free from inspection on nights, Sundays, and holidays, \nwhile grocery stores, in the interest of health, require such \ninspection. Can it be said that food products are more dangerous to \nhealth when sold in a grocery than when sold, for example, in a \nrestaurant or confectionery store? From the standpoint of health, \nwhat distinction is there between selling food to customers on the \npremises and selling it to customers to be taken to their homes? Or \nwhy should a bottle of milk left on a doorstep by a dairy delivery \ncompany be deemed more sanitary or less subject to contaminating \ninfluences than a similar bottle sold over the counter of a grocery \nstore?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe court did not pass upon the question of Sunday sacredness. The \nattempt to close the stores was made upon the basis of \"the public \nhealth, convenience, and general welfare of the people of the city of \nTulare.\" The provisions of the act were declared to be \"based upon an \narbitrary classification and constitute an unwarranted and \nunreasonable interference with the carrying on of a lawful business, \nand are therefore violative of the Federal and State constitutions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in Colonial days, and in some of the cases tried in the early \nhistory of the nation, the question of religion did enter into the \ndecisions by the courts, the tendency today seems to be strongly away \nfrom such a course. The advocates of Sunday laws now generally resort \nto a claim for their necessity from a health standpoint, and in \nrecent times, Sunday laws have seldom, if ever, been upheld from a \nreligious standpoint. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis article appeared in Liberty Magazine during the fourth quarter \nof 1939, a time of economic malaise and international conflict.\u0014",

Arriving in \n1768 with his family and 300 books for the college library, he threw \nhimself into the task of building up the young school. \"He laid the \nfoundation of a course of history in the college, and the principles \nof taste and the rules of good writing were both happily explained by \nhim, and exemplified in his manner,\" a colleague said.\u0014\n \u0014\nAs the Revolution approached, Witherspoon's Presbyterian belief that \npeople should choose their own government put him firmly on the \nPatriot side. He realized the colonies would have to fight Britain. \n\"If your cause is just, if your principles are pure, and if your \nconduct is prudent, you need not fear the multitude of opposing \nhosts,\" he preached. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Continental Congress, some delegates worried the country was \nnot yet ripe for independence. \"The country is not only ripe for the \nmeasure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it!\" Witherspoon \nretorted. He became the only minister to sign the Declaration of \nIndependence. \u0014\nHe lost a son in the Revolution, which also left the college in dire \nstraits. After the war he tackled the job of rebuilding the school. \n\"Do not live useless and die contemptible,\" he exhorted his students, \nwho included nine future cabinet officers, 21 senators, 39 \ncongressmen, three Supreme Court justices, 12 governors, a vice \npresident, and a presidentJames Madison, who was also one of five \nWitherspoon students at the Constitutional Convention.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Hatred, Bigotry Still Thrive Against Muslims \u0014\n\u0014\nLee Camp      July 2, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nYet again, middle Tennessee has made national news for another \nembarrassing episode of apparent bigotry. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a meeting in which a representative of the local Muslim community \nasked her community for an extension of graciousness and indicated \nher own dismay at the burning of a mosque, some members of the \naudience jeered, and even cheered, when she mentioned the burning of \nthe mosque.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What about 9-11?\" one audience member can be heard to shout.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was asked by a reporter for a national public radio story, whether \nI found the behavior shocking in our day and age, whether we have not \ncome further in an extension of tolerance than this.\u0014\n\u0014\nI replied that I do not find the behavior shocking: hatred and \ninhospitality are as old as the hills.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I do continue to find such behavior ironic, and find the public \ndiscussion about the differences and similarities between \nChristianity and Islam altogether failing to get at what I take to be \nsome of the most important and overlooked points.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe continue to labor under two opposite stereotypes  the first \nstereotype particularly labors under a heavy burden of fear. This \nfear is quite understandable.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, it makes sense in the long wake of 9/11. And second, the fear \ncan be understood as an expected phenomenon of anxiety among those \nwho are dealing with relatively rapid changes in their home culture, \nespecially when they have long held the assumed positions of power \nand privilege in that community.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut whatever the sources of such fear, this stereotypical position \ncasts the Muslim community as warmongers, never to be trusted.\u0014\nHatred, Bigotry Still Thrive Against Muslims \u0014\nLee Camp\u0014\nJuly 2, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What are we going to do about all these Muslims around here who want \nto kill us?\" is a line that has been repeated in public more than \nonce here in middle Tennessee. It does not matter what they say, one \nsuch person once said to me; they are trying to take over and will \nlie to you in order to destroy our culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second stereotype is an apparent polar opposite.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgainst those who depict the Muslim as an inevitable warmonger, are \nthose who adhere to an \n\"all-religions-are-basically-the-same-thing-and-are-pursuing-peace\" \nperspective.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this position, religions are particular expressions of more \nuniversal sentiments and principles. All religions are about \"peace\" \nor \"love\" or \"justice,\" and they just try to get at those things in \ndifferent ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, both these stereotypes are fundamentally wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to the \"Muslims-are-warmongers\" stereotype, we must \nunderstand that the classical understanding of war in Islam \nparallels, in significant ways, the so-called \"Justifiable War \nTradition\" in Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is, neither the best of the Christian tradition nor the best of \nthe Islamic tradition pursues indiscriminate war or unjust oppression \nof the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, another deep irony in the demographic in which I have \nencountered the \"all-Muslims-are-war-mongers\" presupposition is this: \nWhile they look down on Islam for its supposed moral inferiority to \nChristianity, they too often do so in a way that refuses to take \nseriously the very Christianity they exalt.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are going to insist, for example, that Islam has no moral \nequivalent to the Sermon on the Mount, we Christians must do so while \ntaking that Sermon on the Mount seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the consistent witness of the early church was that the Sermon on \nthe Mount and the whole of the teachings of the New Testament entails \nno retaliation or engagement in warfare, even so-called \"justified\" \nwarfare.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd this brings us back around to sharply question the proponent of \nthe view that \"all-religions-are-basically-the-same-thing:\" the \nfundamental \"narrative logic,\" as I like to call it, of the Islamic \nand Christian stories are, in fact, very different.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the Christian story, Jesus comes as a Suffering Messiah. He \ninsists that the means by which the world will be redeemed is through \nsuffering love, and that his followers must, in fact, refuse to do to \nour enemies what our enemies have done to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Islamic story, Muhammad first counsels nonretaliation, but \nonce he achieves a certain level of sociopolitical power, he teaches \nthat retaliation is not only permitted, but also required, in order \nto check injustice and oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the suffering Messiah, says the New Testament, is killed, and \nyet vindicated by God in the resurrection. Muhammad the prophet, says \nthe Quran, is victorious and vindicated by God through his military \nvictories.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo summarize: While the \"Just War\" tradition of Christianity and the \nclassical teaching of Islam parallel each other in very important \nways  namely, seeking the cessation of injustice through the \nmoderated use of martial force  it must be said nonetheless that \nMuhammad and Jesus are teaching something quite different.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Jesus, vengeance is not legitimate; for Jesus, warring is not \nlegitimate. For Muhammad, vengeance taking is legitimate; for \nMuhammad, the moderated exercise of war is legitimate.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, we are left with this very challenging question, and perhaps \nunexpected irony: Are U.S. Christians broadly speaking more like \nMuhammad than Jesus?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLee C. Camp is a professor of theology and ethics at Lipscomb \nUniversity in Nashville, Tenn.

    "title": "HOW TO PRAY WHEN YOU'RE PISSED AT GOD",
    "words": "How to Pray When You're \nPissed at God\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy are we so uncomfortable with hurting, angry prayers? \u0014\nReviewed by Paul Pastor \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one escapes pain, and loss is inevitable.\u0014\n\u0014\nI first discovered this personally when I watched my baby brother die \nfrom a genetic defect that was \"incompatible with life.\" Though whole \non the outside, his inner workings were irreparably different from \nwhat people need to survive. I was 8 years old, wide-eyed, and \nconfused. I hope that his 3-day-old suffering was small. But I know \nthat our family's was great. The helplessness, resignation, and \nwrongness of that loss hurt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterwards, I saw from my second-grade perspective the various \nresponses of our church to my family's difficult time. We were new to \nthe faith. I watched my parents mourn and receive comfort from people \nthat we worshipped with on Sundays. Some of them were wonderful, \nsilent. They suffered with us. Others had no clue what to do, other \nthan share awkward platitudes or even trying to change the subject to \nsomething other than the little bundle lying just out of sight.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, I've been around plenty of premature funerals, at plenty \nof hospital beds where the morphine wasn't cutting it, or was cutting \nit too well. Across plenty of coffee tables from close friends one \nAmericano away from breaking down. I've seen and heard the myriad \nChristian responses for when life hurts. Many were wonderful. But \nmany others were totally inadequate to plumb the depths with people \nin the valleys of shadow.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost language\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes I wonder if our Christian subculture has lost the ability \nto reckon with suffering. You'd be hard pressed to find any \nindication in most Christian media that we suffer at all. The few \nresources dedicated to the topic of suffering or anger towards God \nare either for a crowd that already knows the word \"theodicy,\" or \nelse so sugar-coated with sweet nuggets of how to get over your grief \nand on with your life that the pain and richness of suffering all but \ndisappears. Where is the anger? The deep grief? The sense of having \ngazed into the abyss without any indication that God even cared about \nwhat was bumping around down there? We seem to want to excuse God \neven at the moments when our every instinct is to blame him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's polite, but hollow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian story is unflinching in its treatment of suffering. It \nlooks the full horrors of the human experience in the eyeand refuses \nto turn away. It finds life and joy in the middle of it all. Our \ndoctrine is rich with holy contradictions of blood and bandages, \ndeaths and resurrections, and a hundred inexplicable moments of hope \nright when all seems lost. We have holy, angry, righteous indignation \nagainst the world's systems of abuse and oppression. And, of course, \nour spiritual ancestors often railed against God.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo when did we forget our rich, raging heritage\u0014",

    "title": "HOWEVER LONG THE NIGHT -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "However Long the Night: Molly Melching's Journey to Help Millions of \nAfrican Women and Girls Triumph --A book review \u0014\n\u0014\nThrough Tostan classes, human-rights based education, Molly Melching \nwas able to guide a generation of African women to become aware of \ntheir potential as human beings and to encourage them to have a voice \nin their life choices and those of their daughters and granddaughters.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I Liked\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sengalese/Wolof words paired with the chapter names...in some \nways I felt Molloy sought to immerse us in the culture just as much \nas Molly always felt it was important to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nFGC - FGC was not a new \"concept\" for me. In the back of my mind \nsomewhere I had heard the \"legends\" of the barbaric rituals some \ncultures still practice today. But, as far as my mind was concerned, \nthese happenings were distant drums far off somewhere and maybe \nsomething I would read about in National Geographic or on a History \nChannel program from time to time. Reading Molloy's book, there was \nenough detail of the 4 variations of the process for me to seek out \nfurther information via the Internet and yes, even Youtube. I'm going \nto be brutally honest here...I spent a lot of this \"discovery\" time \nwith my legs clenched together or crossed tightly. I think every \nwoman should spend a little time educating herself about FGC and just \nhow big of a problem the cultural practice is, and not just in \nSenegal either. I don't recommend this as a way to \"shock\" someone \ninto outrage...but as a means of education, knowledge, awareness. Who \nare we really if we choose to close our eyes and turn our heads in \nthe face of humanitarian need.\u0014\n\u0014\nHuman rights...to walk away from Molloy's book exclaiming a victory \nin the fight against FGC in Senegal would be (as cliche as it sounds) \nmissing the forest for the trees. The Tostan classes taught the women \nin these African villages that they had rights, responsibilities, and \ngifts as human beings. They were not \"taught\" to reject FGC; they \nrejected it themselves using their own decision making processes \nwhile embracing the true nature of their culture. Wow.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as Molly respected the Senegalese and their culture so does she \nand Molloy respect the Westerners or European people who might be \nreading However Long the Night. While for most American women, the \nidea of submitting ourselves to a debilitating procedure like FGC \nand/or that our mothers would do this \"for us\" thinking that they \nwere doing what was best for us...even loving us by forcing \"the \ntradition,\" is abominable at best. We can't even conceive it. But, \nsomehow Molloy makes us conceive it. The reader doesn't come away \nwith the idea of the villagers as \"ignorant\" but comes away with more \nof an understanding of the WHY behind the practice. NOT that the \nreader comes away with a justification for FGC...please don't \nmisunderstand...but an understanding as to actually HOW the practice \ncontinues and WHY the people who practice FGC defend it so fully. I \nfound myself even comparing FGC to some Western cultural differences \nthat we defend with every fiber of our being.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe details of the Tostan classes and educational theory behind the \nclasses. The social norm theory, other educational theories that \nconsider individual needs, and dynamics behind and within the classes \nreally are valuable for every aspect of education....which is why, of \ncourse, the Tostan programs were able to be developed for literacy \nprograms, marriage expectations between husband and wife, early \nchildhood communication and cognitive stimulation programs, child \nforced marriages and childbearing, and foot binding in China, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I Didn't Like\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was \nadopted by the United Nations in 1993. 1993 is the year my oldest \ndaughter was born. 1993.\u0014\n\u0014\n1993.\u0014\nThere is obviously still much work to be done in human rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nOverall Recommendation\u0014\n\u0014\nI read this book without much of a foundation for the content except \nan interest in human rights, and especially rights for women. I am no \nexpert in this geographical region nor the culture within which most \nof this book takes place...but I was blown away. My brain keeps \nchurning and working out what I've read...finding places where the \ninformation fits and even places where the information replaces \npre-conceived ideas or notions about change and how to facilitate \ngrowth in communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would recommend this book for every woman but also men. Just like \nthe Sengalese village husbands, I think there are certain aspects of \nwomen that men just don't talk about...and as Molloy so effectively \npoints out in However Long the Night, silence is a large part of the \nproblem.\u0014",

Didn't he own several \nmillion-dollar homes and a yacht and, well, just look at the cars he \ndrove and the suits he wore. He said he could make you rich too. Just \ngive him your money and let him invest it like he invested his own. \nHe would take a small, reasonable commission on the money he made for \nyou, but the rest would be yours to luxuriate in.\u0014\n\u0014\nThousands of people believed Bernie and everything that everyone said \nabout him until that day when the whole house of cards came tumbling \ndown and we learned the meaning of the phrase \"Ponzi scheme.\" Bernie \nMadoff had managed to put together the largest, most successful Ponzi \nscheme in history.

He's on vacation in \nEurope -- France or Italy or Turkey or somewhere -- and he has been \nrobbed. His money and passport were stolen, and he's contacting \neveryone he knows asking for help. Can I wire him a few bucks? The \nAmerican consulate says they can replace his passport for $100. Or \nmaybe he hasn't been robbed. Maybe he's been arrested and he's in a \nTurkish jail. Can you help bail him out? He needs $1,239 immediately. \nWire it to this address.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe skeptical. Be very skeptical.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's another email. It says that a child is sick with some exotic \ndisease. All you are asked to do is send an email message to some big \ncorporation and get ten other people to do so, and that corporation \nwill give money to the sick child. Just forward this message to your \nten best friends. Be skeptical. You are about to harass a big \ncorporation with unwanted emails and place your friends on a mailing \nlist from which they will never be able to remove themselves. The \nworld, and especially the internet, has taught us the value of \nhealthy skepticism.\u0014\n\u0014\nMining officials in China told their workers that the mine was \nperfectly safe. This past week, with dozens of workers trapped in a \ncave-in, we learn that they have known for months that the mine was \ndangerous. We do not know if that was also the case at the West \nVirginia mine where at least 25 miners were killed yesterday -- but \nthe safety record of mines with similar explosions in the past has \nbeen spotty enough that it's understandable that our suspicion is \nraised.\u0014\n\u0014\nRestaurants have led us to believe that their food was perfectly \nhealthy and now, when they are told that they have to tell us the \ncalorie count in their servings so we can make informed decisions, \nthey balk.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did that pound can of coffee become 12 ounces? And have you \nactually measured your 8.5 x 11 inch paper lately?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo if life has taught us to be skeptical about nearly everything \nelse, it just makes sense that we should be a little bit skeptical \nabout religious claims as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nTelevangelists who live in mansions and want to send you prayer \ncloths and bottles of Jordan River water \"for a donation\" should be \nviewed with at least a little skepticism. Some people have the gift \nof spiritual healing, and some are simply con artists putting on a \ngood show. A little healthy skepticism helps us tell the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many members of the Branch Davidians, the People's Temple, and \nHeaven's Gate would be alive today if they had developed the ability \nof critical thinking and healthy skepticism, if they had learned to \nthink for themselves?\u0014\n\u0014\nScientist Michael Shermer, in his fascinating book Why People Believe \nWeird Things, reminds us that \"Skepticism is a method, not a \nposition.\" The \"skeptic is one who questions the validity of a \nparticular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSkeptics are not cynics who hold that nothing should be believed. \nThey are convincible if the evidence is convincing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople of faith do not reject or rebuke the questions of the skeptic. \nWe understand them because they were once our own. We welcome them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas was skeptical. They were his friends and he loved them. He \nknew that they believed they had seen Jesus. They had probably \nconvinced themselves that they had seen him. It's called \"group \nthink.\" It happens all the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalk through a crowded room and sniff. Ask people if they smell gas. \n\"Do you smell gas? I smell gas. I'm telling you there's a gas leak in \nhere somewhere.\" Guaranteed, some of those people are going to smell \ngas. They will be convinced that they smelled gas. They will believe \nthat they smelled gas, and those who believe they did will congregate \ntogether and reinforce each others' beliefs. Only they didn't really \nsmell gas because there wasn't any gas to smell.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeed a hundred people the same meal and tell them that some people \nhave gotten sick from food poisoning. Guaranteed, some of those \npeople will be sick before the night is over. And even though there \nnever was anyone sick in the first place, not really, those who \nconvinced themselves that they were will not be talked out of their \nconviction. They were, they will argue, really sick -- really.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first century CE was a time rife with ignorance and superstition. \nIf these kinds of things happen now, how much more likely is it that \nthey happened then?\u0014",

    "title": "HOW PREACHERS CAN PREACH ON HOMOSEXUALITY",
    "words": "Dr. Wesley Hill is the Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at the \nTrinity School for Ministry in Pittsburgh. He's also the author of \nWashed and Waiting: Reflections on Christian Faithfulness and \nHomosexuality. We recently asked Dr. Hill about how preachers can \nfaithfully convey the Bible's message on sexuality while remaining \nsensitive to people who are dealing with same-sex attraction.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreachingToday.com: Preaching on homosexuality is a very personal \nissue for you. Will you tell us your story?\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley Hill: My earliest childhood memories are of hearing Bible \nstories from my parents. I was steeped in the faith from a very young \nage, and like a lot of kids who grow up in that environment I prayed \nthe Sinner's Prayer with my parents when I was very young. I was the \noldest of three kids, and a stereotypical firstborn. I responded well \nto authority, I was very involved at church, and never really went \nthrough a period of rebellion or walking away from my faith. But \naround the time I started to go through puberty I realized that I was \nnot attracted to girls and a lot of my friends were starting to be, \nand I realized I was attracted to my same-sex friends. Growing up in \nthe context that I grew up in, that was very confusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't really have language or categories to understand it. I had \nread a book by James Dobson that said my feelings were a phase that a \nlot of people go through in puberty. I thought: Maybe this will be a \nphase and I'll go away to college and meet the right girl and grow \nout of this. And it wasn't until I was at Wheaton College that I \nrealized nothing was changing and my attraction to my same-sex peers \nis just as strong as it ever had been.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had never talked about it up until then, but I started to open up \nwith godly mentors and pastors at that point. I began to realize that \nif I wanted to grow in my faith in Christ and continue to live \nfaithfully as a believer, I needed to not ignore this anymore. I \nneeded to bring this into the light and talk with others about it. So \nthat's what I did. I met weekly with a pastor who was very helpful in \nnot assuming that he had all the answers. We processed scripture, \nprayed, and explored the issue together.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lot of preachers feel unsure of how to approach this topic in the \npulpit. What helps? What hurts?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, I read a lot of Christian pastors and preachers writing \narticles or books about homosexuality. I haven't heard many sermons \nabout it. Only a few. On one hand, that isn't helpful. We do need to \ntalk about it. On the other, people often perceive Christians as \nbeing obsessed with homosexuality. Like it's all we want to talk \nabout and that we go out of our way to condemn or exclude gay people. \nSo I think there's a certain sense in which that's just not true. I \nmean, I've been a Christian my whole life and I had to wait until I \nwas 31 years old to actually hear a sermon about it at my church. \nIt's not as though other pastors that I've heard have neglected the \ntopic, but it's not often a topic we preach on. That's a double-edged \nsilence: on the one hand, people like me are wondering what we should \ndo, but on the other, we're not being singled out for special \ncondemnation, which is a constant fear of a gay person in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's for starters. But not talking about it isn't a solution.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how can you preach on it well? First, don't talk about \nhomosexuality or being gay as if it's all about sex or attraction or \ndesire. All that is just a small percentage of a gay person's life, \njust like it's a small percentage of a straight person's life. Sex is \nnot the dominant thing. For me, the reality of my homosexuality is \nabout something much, much bigger than sex. It's part of it, \nobviously, but not all of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I have thoughts of going to bed with someone, it is someone of \nthe same sex. But the way I experience it day to day, is through a \nlonging for emotional connection and companionship. So the sermons \nthat have been most discouraging to me have made it seem as though \nhomosexuality is primarily about who you sleep with. And the ones \nthat have been very helpful have had a broader view: that really our \nsexuality is about a lot more than what we do with our bodies. It's \nabout who we're drawn to, how we engage with other people. Recognize \nthat if you're going to speak a word of good news to gay people, it \nhas to be a word that doesn't just talk about what we do in bed, but \nabout how we live in community.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've also heard Christian treatments of homosexuality that implicitly \nor explicitly say that there is really only one primary explanation \nfor why someone's gay. It usually has to do with Freud or something. \nPeople say (for a male) that they didn't get enough healthy same-sex \naffection. Maybe they had an absent father or were alienated from \nsame-sex peers in childhood. Some trauma or deficit became \neroticized. That's the way it's often explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've met some gay people who would say that is the story of their \nsexuality. Others, including me, would say \"that doesn't seem to fit \nmy life.\" I'm not noticeably alienated from my dad or from my \nsame-sex peers. So I value when preachers don't assume that they know \nwhy someone is gay.\u0014\n\u0014\nI recently spoke to a pastor's conference. One of the pastors came up \nto me afterwards and said that their church had a real burden to \nminister to the gay community. He said, \"We just assumed that we knew \nexactly what they needed, and they needed to be in therapy so that \nthey could overcome this deficit in male love. Listening to you, I \nrealize that we made a big assumption about why someone is gay, and \nwe need to be careful. That may be true for some people but it really \ndoesn't fit the story of others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYou're a great exegete. You also describe yourself as a \"celibate gay \nChristian.\" Walk us through your scriptural journey to that term.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike a lot of people, I initially focused on Romans 1 as the \ndefinitive passage on homosexuality. Paul condemns same-sex \nrelationships, but there have been a lot of debates about what kind \nof relationships he had in mind. Was he thinking of exploitative \nrelationships or was he thinking of the kind of partnerships that \nmany gay people have today? It was important to me to work through \nthose questions. I mean, to be honest, what really convinced me is \nwhen I zoomed out and put Romans 1 into the bigger picture of what \nthe New Testament says about sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nI looked at places like Matthew 19 where Jesus talks about divorce. \nHe goes back to Genesis 2 to talk about what marriage means between a \nman and a woman. And then I went to Ephesians 5 and saw that marriage \nbetween a man and a woman is a parable of Christ's love for the \nchurch. Then I went to the end of Revelation where the church is \nportrayed as the bride of Christ and Christ is the groom in this \nwedding feast, the wedding supper of the Lamb. When I contextualized \nRomans 1 in that bigger picture, it was much more compelling to see \nthat Paul's disapproval isn't an arbitrary rule against \nhomosexuality. Instead, it flows from a broader understanding of male \nand female. Ultimately, the difference between male and female is \nmeant to mirror God's difference from us and his love for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament scholar Simon Gathercole has an essay where he \nlooks at Romans 1. Gathercole argues that the reason Paul singles out \nhomosexuality there is that when a sexual partner turns to another \nsexual partner of the same sex, that's a dramatic illustration of \nwhat Paul thinks is true of the human condition at large. So he says \nin Romans 1 that our basic problem is that we've turned away from \nworship of the Creator to worship of the creature, so what we've done \nis we've turned to images of ourselves. We've turned away from God to \nthe same. Instead of worshiping the Creator, we're worshiping the \nsame things that we are, namely creatures, and so that's why \nGathercole argues homosexuality becomes an illustration there of \nwhat's gone wrong with the human condition. It involves two creatures \nturning to images of themselves. When you put that together with what \nPaul says in Ephesians 5 about marriage, suddenly the whole thing \nseems to be much more coherent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do you use the word \"celibate\" instead of \"single\" person?\u0014\n\u0014\nSingle implies a temporary state. To our culture it either means \"I'm \njust unattached right now\" or \"I'm selfish and want to live on my own \nterms.\" I'm not unattached; I'm deeply attached to my local church. \nAnd unless something drastically changes, I don't expect my \nsingleness will be a temporary thing. I'm expecting it to be a \nlifelong thing. Celibacy describes that.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's really helpful. How can pastors support celibate Christians?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think we need to have an approach to pastoral ministry that allows \nfor a long-term sense of waiting and enduring something that we wish \nwere otherwise. For me, for example, there are many ways in which I \njust don't feel that I am made for celibacy. I mean, it often leads \nto loneliness, to difficulty. The natural impulse of a pastor is to \nwant to say to a person who is suffering, \"Let's make this better. \nLet's fix this condition of celibacy so that it's not so painful \nanymore.\" I think that comes from a good motivation, but the most \nhelpful pastors in my life have recognized there are many situations \nthat people find themselves in that you can't fix. So the pastoral \nstrategy then becomes not \"how do we rescue this person out of this \nterrible condition?\" but \"how do we help this person flourish and \nfind love?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul talks a lot in 2 Corinthians about being weak, and you never get \nthe sense from him that God has delivered him from weakness. In fact, \nGod said to him, \"My grace is sufficient for you, my power is made \nperfect in your weakness\"not by rescuing you out of your weakness. I \nfind it helpful when a pastor can recognize that being gay is not \nsomething we're going to fix. There may be a diminishment of same-sex \nattraction that some people experience, or there may not. But either \nway, it's not something that you can just fix. So the question is, \nHow do we help this person find grace and hope in the midst of a \nsituation that may never be what they would wish for?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also need to remember Christian history's rich theology of \nfriendship. We've forgotten about examples like Aelred of Rievaulx \nwho wrote a treatise called \"Spiritual Friendship.\" He offers a \nvision of a very serious, robust kind of love. We need to recover \nthat view of friendship and offer it to our celibate friends like me \nwho need to understand that we're not doomed to a life of loneliness \nand no connections. I can really pour myself out in friendship. I can \nbe with others who pour their lives out for me in friendship. So the \nchoice isn't just between marriage and romance or loneliness. \nSuddenly the choices look very different.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow should pastors care for parents who feel wounded because their \nchild came out?\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't know that I have anything profound to say there. Certain \nChristian understandings of homosexuality automatically lead parents \nto blame themselves for their child being gay. Our best understanding \n(from people like Mark Yarhouse and Stan Jones) is that it's some \nkind of combination of nature and nurture.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo much of our evangelical rhetoric in the past has made it sound as \nthough it's all nurture. Therefore parents are wounded and blame \nthemselves when their kids turn out to be gay. Pastors can say to \nparents, \"We live in a fallen world, and one of the ways people \nexperience the effects of the fall is in same-sex attraction. And you \nmay or may not have much of a role to play in that in your child's \nlife. But whether you are very involved in that or whether you're not \nvery involved, your real need is to know God's love for you and your \nchild in Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTell us about your book, Washed and Waiting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book was written to say that discipleship is all about the virtue \nof hope. As Paul says in Romans 8, if we saw what we're hoping for, \nthen it wouldn't be hope anymore because we would have it. So Paul \nhas an understanding of the Christian life where we're constantly \nlooking forward to the fullness of a redemption that we don't have \nyet. We have the Spirit indwelling us, we have the assurance that \nthere is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, but in a \nreal sense we \"still haven't found what we're looking for,\" to quote \nU2. We are still on the road; we're on the journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as Paul says in Romans 8, we're groaning, we're yearning for the \nredemption of our bodies. There are a lot of Christian books that \ntalk about homosexuality as if it's something that you can leave \nbehind. But there wasn't much that I could find of someone saying, \nYes, you can discipline your sexual life so that you are increasingly \nconforming to God's Word, but that doesn't ever mean you're going to \nstop having to hope. You're going to continue to groan, you're going \nto continue to yearn for the fullness of God's love, which we won't \nexperience until the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wanted to write a book that addressed homosexuality in that \nframework of hope. Washed and Waiting is that book.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Wesley Hill is the Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at \nTrinity School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pennsylvania and the author \nof Washed and Waiting (Zondervan 2010).\u0014",

How do they \narrange to depart? At one moment the birds are here, chattering in \nand out of the barn, arcing across the pasture. And the next moment \nthey have vanished. Do they leave during a flight theyre already \nmaking, or do they somehow gather themselves together beforehand?\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething within them changes in response to something external, the \nlight perhaps. It is that something within them  instinct, \npresumably, as opposed to what we would see as conscious thought  \nthat I dont understand. \u0014\n\u0014\nHumans have always had trouble understanding instinct. If we \nexperience it, we do not recognize it as such. Even the wisest of \nswallow-watchers, Gilbert White, the 18th-century ecologist and \nclergyman, could not decide what to make of instinct. Sometimes, he \nfelt, it was superior in its effects to human reason, and sometimes \nit was obviously inferior. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is, he wrote, a most wonderful unequal faculty. Marvelous as the \nswallows flight is, perhaps its more marvelous still that a swallow \nknows when it is time to fly, time to give up the nests in the barn, \ngive up the hayloft and the new-mown pasture. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll summer long, the swallows have ganged their way out of the barn \nwhenever I enter, as if I had no rights there. Now there is silence. \nI doubt that I will ever see them actually leaving. I feel a kinship \nwith them when they swoop around my tractor, when I watch them share \nthe twilight with the bats. But then off they go, and I wont see \nthem again until next spring. Im left here wondering what the \nswallows know  if knowing is the right word.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW MANY PEOPLE CONVERT TO ISLAM?",
    "words": "The Economist explains\u0014\nHow many people convert to Islam? \u0014\nSep 29th 2013\u0014\n\u0014\nIN THE wake of the attacks on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, \nspeculation has grown about the possible involvement of Samantha \nLewthwaite, a British convert to Islam. Ms Lewthwaite, known as the \nWhite Widow, was married to Germaine Lindsay, one of the London 7/7 \nbombers andhimself a convert. She is wanted by Interpol and the \nKenyan police inconnection with a separate alleged bomb plot. Ms \nLewthwaite, the daughter of a British soldier who served in Northern \nIreland, grew up in the English home counties and converted to Islam \nin her teens. How common are converts to Islam? And why dothey adopt \nthe religion?\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who embrace Islam tend to do so after years of contact with \nMuslims. (Ms Lewthwaite reportedly had a close relationship with \nMuslim neighbours during her youth.) Some, mostly women who make up \naround two-thirds of new believers in Britain, convert because they \nwant to marry a Muslim. Others are fed up with what they see as the \nbawdiness of British society. Many speak of seeking a sense of \ncommunity. Prisons have proven fertile ground for conversions for \nmen.Some worry that those who convert in jail are exposed to more \nradicalstrains of Islam; others say that Islam's discipline \nandstructure, along with the support they received from other \nMuslims, helped them to cope with life inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalculating convert numbers is tricky. The census in England and \nWalesdoes not ask people about their past religions. British mosques \ndo not keep a centralrecord of conversions. Some new believers keep \ntheir conversions secret,worried about the reactions of friends and \nfamily. But using census dataon race and religion, and questionnaires \nissued to mosques, Kevin Brice, a researcher at the University of \nWales Trinity Saint David, calculatedthat around 5,200 Britons turn \nto Islam every year, and that the total number of converts is about \n100,000. In America calculating conversion rates is even harder.The \ncensus does not ask about religion and few mosques keep registers \noftheir members, so even the total number of American Muslims is \nuncertain, let alonethat of converts. In 2007 the Pew Research Centre \nestimatedthat there were around 2.4m American Muslims; in 2000 \nPresident Bill Clinton made reference to a figure of 6m. Pew reckons \nthat just under a quarter are converts, the majority of them African \nAmerican.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome worry that converts are more vulnerable than others toradical \nkinds of Islam because they know little aboutthe religion's different \ntraditions. That is not quite right, says Leon Moosavi, an expert on \nIslamic conversions at Liverpool University. The problem for converts \nis a lack of support, he argues. Some are abandoned by their \nfamilies. They may not be accepted into mainstream mosques, many of \nwhich in Britain resemble ethnic clubs, he says. That isolation can \nmakethem vulnerable to extremists who hope that white converts will \nadd credibility to their cause. But converts who turn to terrorism, \nas Ms Lewthwaite is suspected of doing, are rare. Indeed, the vast, \npeaceable majoritymay help to bridge the gap between Muslims and \nothers. In Western countries the growth in converts is part of \nIslam's transition from an immigrant religion to a home-grown one.\u0014",

And Dot Com was \u0014\na comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. \u0014\nIndeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why \u0014\ndoth thou travel far from town to town with thy \u0014\ngoods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy \u0014\ntent?\" And Abraham did look at her as though she \u0014\nwere several saddle bags short of a camel load, but \u0014\nsimply said, \"How, Dear'?\" And Dot replied, \"I will \u0014\nplace drums in all the towns and drums in between \u0014\nto send messages saying what you have for sale and \u0014\nthey will reply telling you which hath the best price. \u0014\nAnd the sale can be made on the drums and delivery \u0014\nmade by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham thought long and decided he would \u0014\nlet Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums \u0014\nrang out and were an immediate success. Abraham \u0014\nsold all the goods he had at the top price, without \u0014\never moving from his tent. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this success did arouse envy. A man named \u0014\nMaccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum\u0014\nand was accused of insider trading. And the young \u0014\nmen did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy \u0014\nhorsefly take to camel dung. They were called No- \u0014\nmadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or \u0014\nNERDS for short. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd 10, the land was so feverish with joy at the \u0014\nnew riches and the deafening sound of drums. that \u0014\nno one noticed that the real riches were going to the \u0014\ndrum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who \u0014\nbought up every drum company in the land. And \u0014\nindeed did insist on making drums that would work \u0014\nonly with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks. \u0014\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have \u0014\nstarted is being taken over by others.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as Abraham looked out over the Bay of \u0014\nEzekiel, or as it came to be known \"ellay\" he said, \u0014\n\"we need a name that reflects what we are.\" Dot \u0014\nreplied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Opera- \u0014\ntors.\" \"YAHOO\", said Abraham. And that is how it \u0014\nall began.  So it wasn't AI Gore after all.\u0014",

    "words": "Columbus Landed in America--He Lost \nHis Spiritual Goals\u0014\n\u0014\n\tTierra! Tierra! The men had been on the sea for over thirty days \nwithout sight of land. Now land was in plain view. All the despair \nand gloom immediately gave way to excitement and hope as the three \nlittle ships drew closer and closer to the shore on this day, October \n12, 1492.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tProbably every American school child old enough to study history \nhas heard the little rhyme, \"In October, 1492, Columbus sailed the \nocean blue\", and the story has often been told of Columbus' dream of \nfinding the East or Asia by sailing west. Columbus is often held up \nas an example of someone who set goals for himself and would not give \nup when obstacles to achieving those goals came his way -- he waited \nat the Spanish court six years before King Ferdinand and Queen \nIsabella agreed to sponsor his voyage. He persuaded his men to \ncontinue their westward voyage even when they threatened mutiny \nbecause they had not yet reached the expected islands of the Orient. \nCertainly Columbus is a model of determination and courage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYet, the man was much more complex than the stories often reveal. \nChristopher was a very devout Catholic who observed all the fasts of \nthe church and prayed regularly. His very name Christopher, which \nmeans Christ-bearer, he understood as a title of his destiny to carry \nthe message of the gospel to far-off lands. He diligently searched \nthe Scriptures and thought he found assurance for a call to sail to \nthe far reaches of the globe with the Christian message. Zechariah \n9:10 said that \"he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his \ndominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to \nthe ends of the earth. And Psalm 107:23-24 promised that \"They that \ngo down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These \nsee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher was particularly concerned with the power of the Ottoman \nTurks who controlled the eastern Mediterranean and were threatening \nEurope. If a way could be found of reaching India by sailing West, \nthe Turks could be attacked from behind and perhaps the Holy Land \nitself could be rescued from their hands. Yes, Columbus was \ninterested in trade and riches, but Christian concern also lay behind \nhis plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen land was sighted on this day October 12, 1492, in recognition of \nthe divine aid in his voyage, Columbus named the land San Salvador, \nwhich means Holy Savior, and prayed,\u0014\n\u0014\nO Lord, Almighty and everlasting God, by Thy holy Word Thou hast \ncreated the heaven, and the earth, and the sea; blessed and glorified \nbe Thy Name, and praised be Thy Majesty, which hath designed to use \nus, Thy humble servants, that Thy holy Names may be proclaimed in \nthis second part of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn keeping with the Christian motive underlying his mission, Columbus \nat first showed great concern for how the natives, whom he called \nIndians, were treated. He wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that they might be well-disposed towards us, for I knew that they \nwere a people to be delivered and converted to our holy faith rather \nby love than by force, I gave to some red caps and to others glass \nbeads, which they hung around their neck, and many other things...I \nbelieve that they would easily be made Christians, for it seemed to \nme that they had no religion of their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the same, Columbus' concern for the salvation of these people was \ncoupled with an attitude of superiority which saw nothing wrong in \nforcibly capturing the people and making them slaves of the \nEuropeans. And the missionary drive which was prominent during his \nfirst voyage, in later voyages became subordinate to his love of \nwealth and position. Unfortunately, Columbus was not the last to lose \nsight of his spiritual goals when tempted with wealth and power.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBandelier, Ad.

    "title": "HOW JESUS BECAME GOD -- BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "By Bart Ehrman, agnostic author of the book  3/29/14  Huffington Post\u0014\n\u0014\nWritten in support of the new book How Jesus Became God : The \nExaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was a lower-class preacher from Galilee, who, in good \napocalyptic fashion, proclaimed that the end of history as he knew it \nwas going to come to a crashing end, within his own generation. God \nwas soon to intervene in the course of worldly affairs to overthrow \nthe forces of evil and set up a utopian kingdom on earth. And he \nwould be the king.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt didn't happen. Instead of being involved with the destruction of \nGod's enemies, Jesus was unceremoniously crushed by them: arrested, \ntried, humiliated, tortured, and publicly executed.\u0014\nAnd yet, remarkably, soon afterwards his followers began to say that \n-- despite all evidence to the contrary -- Jesus really was the \nmessiah sent from God. More than that, he was actually a divine \nbeing, not a mere human. And not just any divine being. He was the \nCreator of the universe. After long debates among themselves they \ndecided that he was not secondary to the one God of Israel, the Lord \nGod Almighty himself. On the contrary, he was fully equal with God; \nhe had always existed for eternity with God; he was of the same \nessence as God; he was a member of the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did that happen? How did we get from a Jewish apocalyptic \npreacher -- who ended up on the wrong side of the law and was \ncrucified for his efforts -- to the Creator of all things and \nAll-powerful Lord? How did Jesus become God?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the question I address in my book, and I think it's an \ninordinately important one, not just for Christians who personally \nbelieve that Jesus really is God, but for all of us, whether \nbelievers or non-believers, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, \nagnostics, atheists: all of us who are interested (as well we ought \nto be) in the history of Western Civilization. It is not hard to make \nthe argument that if Jesus had never been declared God, our form of \ncivilization would have been unalterably and indescribably different.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is why. If Jesus had never been pronounced a divine being, his \nfollowers would have remained a sect within Judaism, a small group of \nJews who thought that Jesus had delivered the correct interpretation \nof the Jewish law. Gentiles would not have converted to follow Jesus \nany more than they converted to any other form of Judaism. If the \nreligion had not become predominantly Gentile it would not have seen \nsuch a steady and remarkable growth, almost entirely with Gentile \nconverts, over the next three hundred years, when it came to \nencompass something like five per cent of the Empire. If Christianity \nwere not a large and viable religion by the beginning of the fourth \ncentury, the emperor Constantine would almost certainly not have \nconverted to it. If Constantine had not converted, masses of former \npagans would not have accepted the faith in his wake. The empire \nwould not have become predominantly Christian. The Christian religion \nwould not have been made the official religion of the state. The \nChristian church would never have become the dominant religious, \ncultural, social, political, and economic force of the West. We never \nwould have had the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, or \nModernity as we know it. And most of us would still be pagans.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll these developments hinged on the declaration that Jesus was God. \nSo what happened that transformed the crucified peasant, Jesus, into \nthe Lord who created heaven and earth? The answers are not obvious or \nstraightforward, and my book will contain surprises for believers and \nnon-believers alike. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany believers - at least very conservative evangelical Christians \nand others who have not had much contact with biblical scholarship - \nwill be surprised to learn that Jesus did not spend his preaching \nministry in Galilee proclaiming that he was the second member of the \nTrinity. In fact, as I argue in the book, the followers of Jesus had \nno inkling that he was divine until after his death. What changed \ntheir views was the belief, which blind-sided them at first, that \nJesus had been raised from the dead. And why did they come to believe \nthat? Here another surprise is in store. It had nothing to do with \nthe discovery of an empty tomb three days after his death. The \ndisciples probably didn't discover an empty tomb. There probably \nwasn't a tomb.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe followers of Jesus came to think he had been raised because some \nof them (probably not all of them) had visions of him afterwards. \nBoth Christian and non-Christian historians can agree that it was \nvisions of Jesus that made some of Jesus' followers convinced that he \nwas no longer dead. Christians would say that the disciples had these \nvisions because Jesus really appeared to them. Non-Christians would \nsay that (several of ) the disciples had hallucinations. \nHallucinations happen all the time. Especially of deceased loved ones \n(your grandmother who turns up in your bedroom) and of significant \nreligious figures (the Blessed Virgin Mary, who appears regularly in \nextraordinarily well-documented events). Jesus was both a lost loved \none and an important religious leader. As bereaved, heartbroken, and \nguilt-ridden followers, the disciples were prime candidates for such \nvisionary experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the disciples claimed Jesus was alive again but was (obviously) \nno longer here with them, they came to think that he had been taken \nup to heaven (where else could he be?). In ancient Greek, Roman, and \nJewish thinking, a person exalted to the heavenly realm was divinized \n- himself made divine. That's what the earliest Christians thought \nabout Jesus. After that a set of evolutionary forces took over, in \nwhich the followers of Jesus began saying more and more exalted \nthings about him - that he had been made the son of God at his \nresurrection; no, it was at his baptism; no, it was at his birth; no, \nit was before he came into the world; no - he had never been made the \nson of God, he had always been the Son of God; in fact, he had always \nbeen God; more than that, he had created the world; and yet more, he \nwas an eternal being equal with God Almighty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a fascinating set of developments. It is highly important. And \nit matters not just for those who believe that the followers of Jesus \ngot it right, but for anyone who cares about the factors that shaped \nthe world we live in today\u0014",

    "title": "HOW DOES \"DYING FOR OUR SINS\" WORK?",
    "words": "How Does Dying For Our Sins Work?\u0014\nBrian Zahnd\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we say Jesus died for our sins, what does that mean? Its \nundeniably an essential confession of Christian faith, but how does \nit work? This much Im sure of, its not reducible to just one thing. \nIve just finished preaching eight sermons on The Crucified God and \nI know Ive barely scratched the surface of what the cross means. To \ntry to reduce the death of Jesus to a single meaning is an \nimpoverished approach to the mystery of the cross. Im especially \ntalking about those tidy explanations of the cross known as \natonement theories. I find most of them inadequate; others I find \nrepellent. Particularly abhorrent are those theories that portray the \nFather of Jesus as a pagan deity who can only be placated by the \nbarbarism of child sacrifice. The god who is mollified by throwing a \nvirgin into a volcano or by nailing his son to a tree is not the Abba \nof Jesus! \u0014\n\u0014\nNeither is the death of Jesus a kind of quid pro quo by which God \ngains the necessary capital to forgive sinners. No! Jesus does not \nsave us from God; Jesus reveals God! Jesus does not provide God with \nthe capacity to forgive; Jesus reveals God as forgiving love. An \neconomic model of the cross just wont work. Its not as if God is \nsaying, Look, Id love to forgive you, but Ive got to pay off \nJustice first, and, you know how she is, shes a tough goddess, she \nrequires due payment. This understanding of the cross begs the \nquestion of who exactly is in charge  the Father of Jesus or some \nabstract ideal called Justice?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we confess with Paul that Christ died for our sins, we dont \nmean that God required the vicious murder of his Son in order to \nforgive. How would that work anyway? Did God have some scale of \ntorture that once met would satisfy his wrath? Think it through and \nyoull see the problem. Was death not enough to satisfy this god? Did \nit have to be death by crucifixion? Did torture have to be part of \nthe equation? And how does that work? Was there a minimum number of \nlashes required in the scourging? Did the thorny crown have to have a \ncertain number of thorns in order for this god to call the scales \nbalanced? \u0014\n\u0014\nAre you squirming yet? Do you want to say, Well, some of the abuse \nJesus suffered was gratuitous torture by the hands of cruel men. But \nif thats the case, how does this division of labor work? How much \nwas necessary to satisfy God and how much was just for the sport of \nit? No, this approach to understanding Jesus dying for our sins \nclearly wont work.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what do we do? Lets begin here: Before the cross is anything \nelse, it is a catastrophe. It is the unjust lynching of an innocent \nman. This is precisely how the Apostles spoke of the crucifixion of \nJesus in the book of Acts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Jesusyou crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. \nActs 2:23\u0014\n\u0014\nYou killed the author of life, whom God raised from the dead. Acts \n3:15\u0014\n\u0014\nGod raised up Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. Acts \n5:30\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Righteous One you have now betrayed and murdered. Acts 7:52\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is clear, God did not kill Jesus. Jesus was offered as a \nsacrifice in that the Father was willing to send his Son into our \nsinful system in order to expose it as utterly sinful and provide us \nwith another way. The death of Jesus was a sacrifice in that sense. \nBut it was not a sacrifice to appease a wrathful deity or to provide \npayment for a penultimate god subordinate to Justice. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me suggest that when we say Jesus died for our sins, we mean \nsomething like this: We violently sinned our sins into Jesus, and \nJesus revealed the heart of God by forgiving us. When Jesus prayed, \nFather, forgive them, he was not asking God to act contrary to his \nnature. When Jesus prayed, Father, forgive them, he was, as always, \nrevealing the very heart of God! \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the cross we violently sinned our sins into Jesus, and Jesus \nabsorbed them, died because of them, carried them into death, and \nrose on the third day to speak the first world of the new world: \nPeace be with you.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I say we violently sinned our sins into Jesus, I mean that all \nof us are more or less implicated by our explicit or tacit support of \nthe systems of violent power that frame our world. These are the very \npolitical and religious systems that executed Jesus. At the cross we \nsee where Adam and Eves penchant for blame and Cains capacity for \nkilling have led us  to the murder of God! At Golgotha human sin is \nseen as utterly sinful. God did not require the death of Jesus  but \nwe did!\u0014\n\u0014\nSo lets be clear, the cross is not about the appeasement of a \nmonster god. The cross is about the revelation of a merciful God. At \nthe cross we discover a God who would rather die than kill his \nenemies. The cross is where God in Christ absorbs sin and recycles it \ninto forgiveness. The cross is not what God inflicts upon Christ in \norder to forgive. The cross is what God endures in Christ as he \nforgives. Once we understand this, we know what we are seeing when we \nlook at the cross: We are seeing the lengths to which a God of love \nwill go in forgiving sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cross is both ugly and beautiful. Its as ugly as human sin and \nas beautiful as divine love. But in the end, love and beauty win.\u0014",

    "words": "HUMAN INEQUALITY: 150 YEARS AGO\u0014\nA Biblical and Christian Defense of African Slavery\u0014\nBy Samuel Boykin\u0014\n\u0014\nEditors Note: \u0014\n\u0014\nWell into the 1960s many white Baptists in America, particularly \nSouthern Baptists, invoked biblical theology in insisting that blacks \nwere inferior to whites and therefore should be treated by society \nand government as lesser human beings. Now, the most talked about \nsocial issue in America is homosexuality. From a historical \nperspective, it is no surprise that today many conservative Baptists \nutilize biblical theology in arguing for the inequality of \nnon-heterosexuals, demanding that society recognize and government \nenforce their biblical convictions. \u0014\n\u0014\nConservative Christian appeals to the state to enforce theological \nconvictions are nothing new, having existed since the time of \nConstantine: for much of Christian history, non-Trinitarians and/or \nopponents of infant baptism were subject to the death penalty. In \nrecent centuries, slavery (19th century), segregation (20th century) \nand homosexuality (21st century) have been at the forefront of the \nquest to utilize the state to enforce religious dogma. While \nChristian attempts to mandate discrimination against homosexuals are \nquickly being brushed aside by courts in America, in much of the \nMiddle East and Africa homosexuality is still punishable by death due \nto state deference to fundamentalist Islamic or, in some instances, \nfundamentalist Christian theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn May 1864 a Southern Baptist leader penned an impassioned editorial \nfor human inequality. The occasion was the looming defeat of the \nslave-based Confederate States of America. Samuel Boykin (1829-1899), \neditor of the Georgia Baptist Christian Index and arguably the most \nprominent Baptist in the state, was determined that his white, common \nfolk readers remained theologically committed to African slaveryeven \nthough the peculiar institution was of benefit primarily to wealthy \nslaveholders (the 1% of their day). \u0014\n\u0014\nWeaving together theology, morality, history and ethics in a \nfull-throttled apologetic for African slavery, Boykins argument \nrepresents a blueprint for religiously-justified human inequality \nthat is yet utilized by many Christians of the 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvidently the result of divine agency in human affairs, is intended \nby the Almighty as a defence of the Institution of slavery. For more \nthan a quarter of a century, abolition fanaticism has been battering \nagainst this special decree of Providence; for thirty years this \nfanaticism has sought to overthrow, in the South, that Institution \nwhich God planted here, which he has ever sanctioned, and for which \nhe had purposely provided a people; and, in order to put a forcible \nstop to this sacrilegious interference with His own plans, the \nAlmighty brought about this mighty war, the consequences of which, by \nits success on our part, will be the complete vindication of Slavery \nas a divine institution, the certain eventuation of that destiny \nwhich the Lord has alloted to the South, and a guarantee of the grand \nresults, whatever they may be, which African slavery is intended to \neffect upon the human race. What that effect is, we know not; nor is \nit our purpose to inquire. But we would simply state, that that \nInstitution must be from God, which is as plainly of divine origin as \nis the Bible itself; which as clearly possesses divine sanction as do \nhuman governments; to the existence of which all history and the \nwritings of all the Fathers bear witness; which the ancient church \napproved and practiced; to which nearly all commentators of note \nsince the Reformation; which philosophy clearly indicates and \nestablishes; which received not one word of rebuke from the Savior or \nhis apostles; the propriety of which has been approved by \nemancipation in the West Indies; the benefits of which has been shown \nby the moral and physical elevation of the slave; the consequences of \nwhich have been the wonderful amelioration of a race that else had \ncontinued to grope in heathen darkness and degradation; and the \neventual result of which may be the evangelization of all Africa, and \nits disenthralment from the chains of gross error, heathen \nsuperstition and degrading barbarism. To such an institution no sin \ncan attach; though sin may attach to its abuse; though it be no sin \nto hold slaves yet the slaveholder many sin in the treatment of his \nslaves. Since slavery, then, as an offspring of the divine mind, is \nnot merely a sinless institution, but one from which accrues benefit \nto master and slave, opposition to slavery is the product of \ninfidelity. Such opposition, beget by infidelity, conceived by error, \nand brought forth by misapprehension, is nothing more than an \natheistic contest with God himself. And the sure result of that \ndefeat in that contest is the confirmation of atheistic principles in \nthe mind of the human contestant; which is proved by the declaration \nof the ranker abolitionists that if the God of the Bible is the God \nof slavery, they will abjure him altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch being the position of affairs, and abolitionism having become so \nfoully rampant, it need not excite surprise, that the Almighty, who \nWorks in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform, should have \nawakened the mighty Demon of War to vindicate His purposes and punish \nhis opponents. That we, too, are made to suffer, may excite surprise; \nbut let it be remembered that we may have abused our trust, or that \nwe may need this fiery purification, or that our minds may require \nthis decided confirmation of the Lords will of purpose.-But we may \nrest assured of this one thing, that if we are victorious in the \nconflict-and victorious we will bethe establishment of slavery as a \ndivine institution may be considered strongly confirmed; and such \ngrandeur and prosperity will result, or such benefit and human \namelioration will accrue, as will open the eyes of all, and astound \nthe nations of earth, and wring from their reluctant lips praises to \nthe God of heaven.\u0014",

    "words": "Honor Killings Still \nOccur Where Patriarchy Prevails \u0014\nClaude Mariottini\u0014\nJune 4, 2014   EThjicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nThe murder of a member of a family, generally a woman, by another \nmember of the family because of the perception that the person has \nbrought shame to the family is known as \"honor killing.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis practice has made international headlines twice in May.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wrote about the tragic story of a woman in Afghanistan who had run \naway to avoid marrying a man to whom her family had forcibly \nbetrothed her in early May.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman agreed to return to her family after her father had signed \na document guaranteeing that she would not be harmed. The family did \nnot honor their agreement, and the woman was killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 29, Ishaan Tharoor, a foreign affairs writer for The \nWashington Post, reported about a woman in Pakistan who was brutally \nkilled in the name of honor killing because she refused to be forced \ninto an arranged marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A 25-year-old pregnant woman, was confronted by a mob of 20 or so of \nher family members near the steps of the top court in Lahore, \nPakistan's second-biggest city. They proceeded to beat her to death \nwith sticks and bricks while police nearby looked on and did little,\" \nTharoor wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The reason for the attack? She had chosen to marry a 45-year-old man \nnamed Muhammad Iqbal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was a union deemed unacceptable by her family, which had filed \nan abduction case against the husband,\" he explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nHonor killings such as these still occur in societies where \npatriarchy is still prevalent.\u0014\n\u0014\nGerda Lerner, in her book, \"The Creation of Patriarchy,\" has a \nclassical definition of patriarchy: \"The manifestation and \ninstitutionalization of male dominance over women and children in the \nfamily and the extension of male dominance over women in society in \ngeneral. It implies that men hold power in all important institutions \nof society and that women are deprived of access to power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many reasons given for this dominance of men over women.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne traditional reason found in many societies is that women are \nsubordinate to men because this is the divine order in creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers say women are subordinate to men because a woman brought sin \ninto the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason given for male dominance is due to sexual inequality \nbecause woman, at creation, was assigned the biological function to \nbe a mother and a nurturer while man was assigned the role to be a \nprovider and a defender.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn patriarchal societies, a man has legal and social power over his \nwife and children, and he has the power to forcibly remove a woman \nfrom her home through negotiated marriage, in which the daughter \nmarries a man designated by the father.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a negotiated marriage may bring financial or social benefits to \nthe family of the bride.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church in the 21st century must challenge the concept of \npatriarchy and female subordination.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is a call to freedom and \nequality.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the apostle Paul wrote: \"There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is \nno longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all \nof you are one in Christ Jesus\" (Galatians 3:28).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Paul is saying is that in Christ there is no longer any \ndistinction in spiritual privilege or status between male and female.\u0014\n\u0014\nMen and women were created in the image of God and as God's \nrepresentatives; they were given authority over God's creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, in Christ, social and biological differences cannot be used as \nthe basis of men's authority over women or as a reason to deprive \nwomen of their dignity as human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is much the church can proclaim about the creational authority \ngiven to both men and women by God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church can also proclaim the spiritual rights and privileges \nevery believer has in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatriarchy had a beginning and patriarchy can have an end. The end of \npatriarchy is the liberating message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nClaude Mariottini is professor of Old Testament at Northern Baptist \nSeminary in Lombard, Illinois.\u0014",

    "words": "How to Ensure Your Church Staff is the Right Size \u0014\nLarry McSwain       July 2, 2014    EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nMost American congregations face a painful reality. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid T. Olson has established clearly that no more than 17 percent \nof the population attends any church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only congregations growing are those smaller than 49 or more than \n2,000 in attendance, or those begun since 1990.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat means the majority of congregations are stuck or declining.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most difficult \"pinch\" points for congregations is the \nincreasing load of costs to maintain the staff models of the \npastfull-time ministers for each program of the church, paid staff \nto do most of the support work, and a growing percentage of budget \nspent for employees.\u0014\n\u0014\nRealignment is an agenda most do not wish to face, but the facts call \nfor fresh thinking about congregational leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nParallel to this crisis of decline is a rapid increase in the cost of \nmaintaining fair salaries and benefits for those who are employed for \nchurch leadership and support.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe costs of health insurance and maintaining appropriate retirement \nbenefits now compete with growing costs of insurance, utilities and \nmaintenance for overbuilt or inefficient facilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery congregation must seek new approaches in their own setting with \neffective processes of change that address them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following suggestions may stimulate some creative thinking about \nthese strategic issues, which can result in healthier and more \neffective outcomes in the work of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the future will require a new emphasis on the importance of \nvolunteerism within the congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day is past when most congregations can employ enough people to \ndo what is needed to accomplish their work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not an easy challenge when the average frequency of \nattendance for most faithful church participants is less than two \nSundays per month.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, focus on the essential functions of worship, opportunities \nfor learning, building hospitable opportunities for enhancing \nrelationships among participants, and connecting to the community to \nattract new faces and new voices.\u0014\n\u0014\nActivities, programs or events that do not contribute vitally to \nthese central functions are destined for extinction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, rethink how to get done both the ministry functions and the \nadministrative tasks necessary for all congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the following:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Begin with volunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe work of employees must focus increasingly on designing the work \nof the church around a group of volunteers that functions like \nemployees without pay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe growing base of retirees who can function with defined job \ndescriptions and given the authority to do their work will be a \nuseful model.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Use part-time contract employees.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are increasing numbers of capable, computer-literate persons \nwho can accomplish administrative tasks of creating newsletters, \nemail communications, financial record-keeping, telephoning and other \ntasks from home.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmployees who work less than 1,000 hours per year can be contracted \nas self-employed, responsible for their own Social Security/Medicare \nexpenses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe contract worker can also benefit from business-related \ndeductions, while the church will benefit from paying higher hourly \namounts to these persons.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Move to more part-time employees.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the staff in medium-sized and smaller congregations who \nretire or relocate will be replaced by part-time employees.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Follow careful guidelines in the number of full-time employees for \nthe church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe usual norms are no more than one ministerial employee for each \n100 to 150 persons in average worship attendance.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second guideline is to enlarge the size of support staff in the \nform of administrative assistants in relation to the number of \nfull-time ministerial employees.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt makes little sense to pay a minister with high levels of education \nand compensation to do the multiple secretarial tasks they often do \nbecause of the scarcity of support persons.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Explore the potential of outsourcing increasing numbers of tasks, \nsuch as facilities maintenance/cleaning, social events, financial and \npersonnel records to local businesses on a contract basis.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Redefine the places and ways church staff members do their work.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an electronic age of cell phone usage, texting, emails, social \nmedia and the importance of personal contact, sitting in an office at \nthe church may be the most inefficient way to accomplish God's work \nin the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs the future configuration of ministerial work centered in an \nautomobile with a cell phone and notebook computer?\u0014\n\u0014\nNone of these suggestions can be implemented quickly, but they offer \nthe potential of streamlining much of the work many congregations \nattempt to do with staff they can no longer afford.\u0014\n\u0002Larry McSwain is a consultant with the Center for Healthy \nCongregations\u0014",

    "words": "How It Feels to \nLove and Hate a Sex Offender\u0014\n\u0014\nAbusers families are secondary victims, left to reconcile their \nconflicting emotions. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaureen Farrell Garcia, Her.meneutics   Christianity Today    Jul 7 \n2014 \u0014\n \u0014\nYears ago, before my current husband Jeff and I were married, I asked \none of my daughters how she would feel if Jeff officially became one \nof the family. At first she responded enthusiastically, about how \nawesome it would be if he lived with us, about how we can watch all \nkinds of spooky movies and he'll make us laugh and feel safe, about \nthe midnight chocolate cake quest on that night when no one could \nsleep.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then she added somberly, \"As long as I don't have to call Jeffrey \n'Dad.'\" I assured her no one would ever make her call him anything \nshe wasn't comfortable with. She nodded and said, \"Good. Because dads \nare bad.\" Dads are bad. Her father, during the decade we were \nmarried, sexually abused a beloved family member for at least three \nyears. His victim bravely disclosed her abuse when she was 12.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast month's controversy over a Leadership Journal article written by \na convicted sex offender included the criticism that the author \nbarely mentions his victim, except to implicate her in her own abuse. \nPlus, his wife and children are mentioned even less. This emphasis on \na sex offender himself over his primary victims (those groomed and \ndirectly abused) and secondary victims, such as his wife and children \n(those groomed and impacted by the predator's betrayals and \ndeception) is sadly common amid cases of abuse within evangelical \nculture. My non-evangelical friends, both Catholic and secular, did \nnot seem to have this problem. But now, thankfully, this trend seems \nto be shifting with more evangelical Christians encouraging victims \nto share their experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen people found out about my ex-husband's abuse, I usually heard \none of two responses. Many evangelical friends from our church \nadvocated for me to stay married to him, to forgive him. It felt like \nthey meant for me to somehow forget the devastating harm he has \ncaused. As if that was possible. Others wanted me to hate him, \ndehumanize him, and claim him a monster. But it isn't like I had a \nswitch I could flip to turn off loving someone. Plus, he is not a \nmonster, but a human being bearing the stamp of God's image. And this \ntruth, that he images God, makes his betrayals so much worse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat neither side understood was, like many family members in this \nunfortunate, heartbreaking situation, I felt both love and hate, \nempathy and anger, and so much more.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the legacies of being groomed and betrayed by a sex offender \nis a horrific ambivalence. We struggle with experiencing and \nprocessing more than one opposing emotion at one time. I would feel \nlove and hate in the same moment or pleasure combined with disgust \nand aversion. I would feel empathy for my ex-husband punctuated by \nhorror.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is like being ripped in shreds. Betrayal rends. It is an attack on \none's integrity. I felt no longer whole. I was fractured. I was \nshattered.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, reality took on a surreal quality. It seemed as if everything I \nknew to be true was a mere veil upon a dark writhing reality that lay \nbeneath lurking, waiting like quicksand for me to step in the wrong \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, I experienced the psychological and emotional effects of \nsignificant trauma. I resonate with Nancy Venable Raine's description \nof life after rape, \"Sometimes, when I am working in my garden, I \nlook around at its beauty and feel for a moment that it is no more \nthan a beautiful egg out of which a predatory, reptilian \ncreaturewill emerge, head first and slimy. It feels like something I \nknow, not something I imagine.\" My life that had once felt safe and \nbeautiful suddenly became ominous and threatening.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost people do not understand how sex offenders function and \ntherefore do not realize the depth of their damage. For example, many \npeople minimize sexual abusebelieving that recovery is only about \ndealing with individual episodes of sexual abuse. However, what makes \nrecovery much more complex is that any occurrence of sexual abuse \ntakes place in the context of power and control, gained through the \nmanipulation of love and trust. Sexual offenders groom victims, as \nwell as their communities. They establish control to twist and \ndistort their victims' views of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the healing process, I've learned that the families of sex \noffenders, the secondary victims, just like primary victims, must \nlearn to do basic things even when all our beliefs and emotions \nscream it is not safe. We must learn to risk trusting, loving, and \nempathizing, even though these were the very things the abuser used \nto betray and violate.\u0014\n\u0014\nHealing may look like courage but feels like fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, we have been healing in spite of well-intentioned Christians who \nhave shamed us because we have not healed quickly enough in the way \nthey think we should have. We have not \"forgiven\" in a way that \nallows my ex-husband to continue to violate our boundaries. We have \nnot \"reconciled\" in a way that will allow our abuser to coerce us to \nfeel sympathy for him. We have not forgotten the destruction he's \ndone, and we pray for God to restrict any future destruction he may \ncause in his new family and his community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, this healing has been facilitated with the prayerful \nsupport of Christians who understand. Within our church and the \nchurches we were connected with, we were blessed with individual \nChristians who offered wisdom and comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the abusive wounds were inflicted within relationship they must \nbe healed within relationships with those who image God correctly. \nGod has placed trustworthy people in my path to guide our healing, to \nprovide the safety needed to learn to trust again.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a long period of separation, and after I attended much therapy, \nmy ex-husband and I divorced. Instead of risking a trial, he pled \nguilty to the lesser charge of a misdemeanor. He received no jail \ntime. He is remarried, and his new family lives less than 10 minutes \nfrom mine. Over the last decade we have seen no evidence of any \nsignificant change, or of any lasting repentance. I also remarried. \n(And for those who are interested, no, my daughter has never called \nJeffrey \"Dad\" but I have heard her introduce him proudly as her \n\"parent.\" Sometimes healing and trust are revealed in the use of a \nsingle word.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people we were and the people we were becoming are gone. There \nhas been significant soul damage, long lasting effects that we are \nstill, many years later, discovering. We are new creations, shattered \nbeings journeying on a path towards wholeness. Yet, shattered as we \nare, damaged as we've been, we still manage to reflect light.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaureen Farrell Garcia loves biblical narratives, books, and tea. \nShe's a mother of three valiant daughters, wife of a New Testament \nscholar, and a writer that teaches at a Christian college.

    "words": "George Washington Carver: A Hero Few Know \u0014\n\u0014\nChuck Summers\u0014\nAugust 21, 2014   EthicisDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nI have a new hero now.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt happened by accident recently when a friend and I met in Missouri \nfor a few days of photography in the southwest portion of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe wanted to explore the prairies in the area. It just so happened \nthat one of the prairies we visited ended up being located quite \nclose to the George Washington Carver National Monument.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe decided we'd stop in and visit the place, which proved to be a \nsignificant decision for both of us\u0014\n.\u0014\nNeither of us knew much about Carver other than he was an African \nAmerican who became famous for studying peanuts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, I have long used a particular quotation by Carver when I \ndo talks on God and creation: \"Nature is an unlimited broadcasting \nstation through which God speaks to us every hourif we will only \ntune in.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on that quotation, I assumed Carver was a person of faith. I \nhad no idea just how much so until touring the national monument that \nbears his name.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington Carver grew up a slave, and knew neither his mother \nnor father. He fell in love with nature as a young boy and, in \nparticular, was fond of wildflowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith great determination he pursued an education, something that was \nnot easy to do for a black person at that time in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was extremely bright and talented. He had great artistic talent \nand was also a musician, but he was destined to make an impact on the \nworld through his botanical studies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe list of his accomplishments is staggering. In his book on Carver \ntitled, \"The Man Who Talks With the Flowers,\" Glenn Clark says, \"he \ndiscovered 300 new uses for the peanut and 150 new uses for the sweet \npotato and before he was through he had rebuilt the agriculture of \nthe south.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA movie about Carver's accomplishment was shown at the national \nmonument. After viewing it, my friend and I both marveled that most \npeople know so little about this great man.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis story truly is an amazing and inspiring one. It is a story of one \nwho endured great hardship and adversity but overcame it. It is a \nstory of faith and perseverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarver wrote and spoke often of the close connection between God and \nnature. He once said, \"nature in its varied forms are the little \nwindows through which God permits me to commune with him, and to see \nmuch of his glory, majesty, and power by simply lifting the curtain \nand looking in.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt another time he said, \"More and more as we come closer and closer \nin touch with nature and its teaching we are able to see the Divine \nand are therefore fitted to interpret correctly the various languages \nspoken by all forms of nature about us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCarver spent a great deal of time in communion with both God and \nnature. He often gave God credit for his many discoveries and \nencouraged people to get to know both God and nature better.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe urged people to experience nature more, saying, \"Reading about \nnature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and listens \ncarefully, he can learn more than what is in books, for they speak \nwith the voice of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Carver came to look at the world this way, he said, \"never since \nhave I been without this consciousness of the Creator speaking to me \nthrough flowers, rocks, animals, plants, and all other aspects of his \ncreation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI read a brief biography on Carver soon after my trip. It made me \neven more aware of what a person of faith he was.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis faith in God connected him even closer to nature and also to his \nfellow man. He committed his life to studying one and to serving the \nother, living a life characterized by humility and integrity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe showed the world that faith and science are not opposites but \ncompanions and demonstrated what one person who lives for the glory \nof God can do.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all of these reasons and more, I now have a new hero. How the \nworld could use more people like George Washington Carver today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002Chuck Summers is a pastor of the First Christian Church (Disciples \nof Christ) in Henderson, Kentucky.\u0014",

Please. Even if \nhomosexual couples somehow undermined marriage, they could not do \nmore damage than heterosexuals have done.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce rates suggest marriage fell under siege long before \nhomosexual marriage came under consideration. About 50 percent of \nfirst marriages end in divorce. A majority of children apparently \nlive in circumstances outside the traditional nuclear family. They \nlive with single parents, stepparents, grandparents, other relatives \nor adoptive parents. Homosexuals had nothing to do with the rise of \nnontraditional families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disheartening trends may increase; they may not. But know this: \nHomosexual marriages will not cause happy heterosexual couples to \nsplit. A man and a woman will not be telling counselors, priests or \nlawyers that they intended to stay married for life but when the \nUnited States recognized the right to homosexual marriage they \ndecided to put asunder what God had joined together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report by the Catholic Churchs Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on \nthe Family generated astonishment, applause, anticipation and denial. \nThe synod embraced extraordinary rhetoric and attitudes toward \nhomosexuals that in gentle ways convey welcome and hospitality. \nConservatives promptly noted that doctrine regarding marriage and \nsexuality has not changed.

On the contrary, he had just emerged into the world. He was \nborn in Thornton, New Hampshire.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch work attracted Rankin. He trained for the ministry at Andover \nTheological Seminary. After his ordination, he pastored churches up \nand down the east coast, churning out singsong religious verse. You \ncouldn't call it religious poetry without doing injustice to the real \nthing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Rankin also wrote the fine hymn \"God Be with You till We Meet \nAgain.\" You'd think a song like that had a special story behind it--a \nbeautiful daughter sailing to India, a friend dying of yellow fever. \nBut no. Rankin said he just wanted something the church could sing \nwhen service was breaking up for the week. He got the idea for the \nfirst stanza of the song when the dictionary told him that \"good-bye\" \nwas short for \"God be with you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God be with you till we meet again,\u0014\nBy His counsels guide, uphold you,\u0014\nWith His sheep securely fold you;\u0014\nGod be with you till we meet again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRankin was a Congregationalist but he sent the words to the Methodist \norganist, William G. Tomer, who wrote the tune. However, it was Ira \nB. Sankey, Moody's song evangelist, who really popularized the song, \nsinging it on both sides of the Atlantic.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah Rankin also wrote \"Tell it to Jesus,\" which is almost as \npopular as \"God Be with You.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1889 the hymn-writing preacher became president of Howard College \nin Washington, DC, a school originally founded as a seminary after \nthe Civil War to educate African-Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah.

Harriet vowed to write \nsomething. The result was Uncle Tom's Cabin. An international \nbestseller, it was adored by abolitionists but vilified by the South. \nIt so enflamed popular opinion that when she met Abraham Lincoln \nduring the war between the states he said, \"So this is the little \nlady who made this big war!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHarriet was born in Litchfield, Connecticut on this day June 14, \n1811, the sixth child of Lyman Beecher, an ardent Calvinist and \nPuritan. \"Wisht it had been a boy,\" remarked Lyman. Although he doted \non his daughters, he desired sons who could become preachers and \nsoul-winners. The fifth Beecher child had also been named Harriet, \nbut had died of whooping cough a few weeks after birth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHarriet was often morbid while growing up as she struggled with \nissues of faith. But when she was fourteen, she cried to her father \nthat she had given herself to Christ. Later in her marriage to Calvin \nStowe, she would plead with him to seek Christ with the same burning \ndevotion with which he sought knowledge. \"If you had studied Christ \nwith half the energy that you have studied Luther ... then would he \nbe formed in you ... \" When he turned to spiritualism, she pleaded \nwith him, the biblical scholar, that it was unbiblical. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Harriet wrote many other books and stories, Uncle Tom's \nCabin is her best. Blacks are shown as fully human and, more \nimportantly, as created in the image of Christ. Many of the \ncharacters, such as Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, Eva and Topsy are vivid \nand memorable. Eliza, crossing the Ohio river by leaping from chunk \nto chunk of ice, is an unforgettable picture and is based on the true \naccount of a desperate fugitive.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics were harsh. When one of Harriet's children died, some said \nGod had taken the babe to keep Harriet from growing vain over her \nsuccess. She replied, \"I wrote what I did because as a woman, as a \nmother, I was oppressed & brokenhearted, with the sorrows & injustice \nI saw, because as a Christian I felt the dishonor to \nChristianity--because as a lover of my country I trembled at the \ncoming day of wrath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was always in financial difficulty. Neither she nor Calvin \nunderstood money management. After her literary success, they built \nan expensive house which turned into a money pit. Bad investments \ngobbled up thousands more dollars. The Stowes also suffered in other \nways. Calvin was a hypochondriac. A rapid succession of children left \nHarriet weak. One son predeceased the parents. Another became an \nalcoholic and disappeared from sight. Harriet also was loudly berated \nfor her defense of Lady Byron. Her last ten years she lived in a \nnever-never world, no longer fixed to reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nAllen, John. One Hundred Great Lives.

The election of \n1824 gave none of the three candidates a majority vote. Under the \nConstitution, the House of Representatives must decide the matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 9th, 1825 they did so. Rejecting Andrew Jackson \nand Henry Clay, they chose one of their own, John Quincy Adams.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil George W. Bush's election, he was the only president's son to \nhave become president himself. Before holding America's highest \noffice, Adams was a lawyer, senator, diplomat, and Secretary of State.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man could be elected is a reflection of America's \nreligious roots. John Quincy Adams sprang directly from those roots \nand had a firm faith. If Christianity is proven by character, Adams \nwas surely a Christian. This stubborn man whose motto was \"Watch and \nPray,\" spoke openly of his trust in God: but not for that did he win \nhis nickname \"Old Eloquence.\" Rather, it was for championing \nprinciple and attacking the institution of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was an unyielding patriarch, tough as the granite of his native \nNew England. Every day he read two to five chapters of the Bible in \nthe original Hebrew and Greek and drew strength from them. He prayed \ndaily. Not content merely to read, he acted on what he read. So often \ndid he put principle before party he became highly unpopular with his \nfollowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Quincy did not let their disapproval alter his course. \"The \nSermon on the Mount commends me to lay up for myself treasures, not \non earth, but in Heaven.

    "words": "Hannah More: \nPowerhouse in a Petticoat\u0014\n\u0014\nMeet the heart of William Wilberforce's abolitionist movement.\u0014\nKaren Swallow Prior/ March 4, 2015 Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat William Wilberforce was among men, Hannah More was among \nwomen. So the Christian Observer proclaimed upon More's death in \n1833. Wilberforce, the parliamentarian and politician, was the most \npublic face of the campaign, and today is nearly synonymous with the \nBritish abolitionist movement. By contrast, as a woman who could not \neven vote or join abolitionist societies of the day, More was \ndestined for obscurity. Yet historians agree she was the single most \ninfluential woman in the British abolitionist movement. One \nbiographer said her efforts formed one of the earliest propaganda \ncampaigns for social reform in English history.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce a celebrated literary figure, More (17451833) was a close \nfriend of Wilberforce. And like him, she was a tireless force for \nabolition and reform of British society from high to low. But unlike \nWilberforcewho is still celebrated in best-selling biographies and \nmoviesMore is largely unknown outside her home region near Bristol.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a woman who could not vote or join abolitionist societies of the \nday, More was destined for obscurity. Yet historians agree she was \nthe single most influential woman in the British abolitionist \nmovement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1807, 20 years after Wilberforce led the parliamentary campaign \nagainst it, the slave trade was abolished. But the remaining slaves \nweren't freed until 1833, just weeks before More died. In the ensuing \nyears, More was hardly idle. With support from Wilberforce, Newton, \nand her evangelical friends known as the Clapham Sect, she \nspearheaded numerous reform efforts. In rural areas outside Bristol, \nshe opened Sunday schools where the children of poor laborers, then \nthe laborers themselves, learned reading, arithmetic, Bible lessons, \nand employable skills. Having created a newly literate class among \nthe poor, More then began publishing cheap tracts filled with stories \nand songs imparting moral lessons designed to guide the oppressed \npoor.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe continued into old age to write antirevolutionary treatises and \nworks of spiritual devotion alike. With her Clapham colleagues, she \nalso initiated Britain's first child-labor laws and founded the \nSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. If Wilberforce was \nthe voice of their movement, Hannah More was its heart and hands.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  So why is she mostly unheard of \ntoday?\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Intellectual Storm\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she died at age 88, More was a celebrity, known throughout the \nBritish Empire, America, and beyond. She lived her last years as a \npatron saint of British and US evangelicals, countless numbers of \nwhom visited her rural estate outside Bristol. They came hoping to \nlearn at the feet of the woman whose critics had nicknamed her the \nBishop in petticoats.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet an article published a century later showed how much her \nreputation and legacy had declined. In 1925, the novelist E. M. \nForster (whose great-aunt, Marianne Thornton, was More's goddaughter) \npublished an article in The New Republic. The title of the \narticlesimply Mrs. Hannah Moresuggests that, nearly a century \nafter her death, More needed no introduction. However, the kindest \nthing Forster said about More was that her work was good, if \neducation is good. He continued, sneering, She taught the poor to \nread and wash themselves, observe Sunday, and honor the king, and \nbefore that no one had taught them anything. Forster, a fellow of \nKing's College at Cambridge, ungallantly summed up the character of \nMore and her four sisters as lively, hospitable, jabbering, and \nsuppressing the slave trade and elevating the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly more than time had passed since 1833. An era had passed, \ntoo.  They scarcely noticed the sands shifting under their feet.  \u0014\n\u0014\nWe live in the world that More, Wilberforce, Newton, and others \nmarked deeply with Christian compassion and justice. The fact \nremains: Their accomplishments rank among some of the greatest \nachieved by the fewest people in any time in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe morality More and others cultivatedduty, piety, thrift, and hard \nworkmade the middle class. It did so by freeing the slaves, lifting \nmany of the nation's poor out of the stagnant pool of subsistence \nliving, and elevating the idea of the potential of each individual.\u0014\n\u0014\n........\u0014\nIn hindsight, More and friends seem to have undervalued the world of \nideas. Yet the modernists who came after them erred in the opposite \ndirection. The early evangelicals' general failure to engage the mind \nmakes sense when lifting the slaves and the poor out of oppression \nand the fashionable out of dissipation are viewed, rightly, as more \npressing needs in the triage of cultural redemption.\u0014\nMore's reputation, like her literary fame, was but a vapor. But the \nsouls of the Africans her efforts helped to free, the poor whose \nlives were improved in her schools, and the elite who were moved by \nher example are eternal.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO DESTROY YOUR PASTOR",
    "words": "Christianity Today      March 31, 2015/              Peter W. Chin \u0014\n\u0014\nHow to Destroy Your Pastor \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat threatens pastors most is not the attack that comes from outside \nthe church, but the criticisms of cliques from within. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past 15 years of pastoral ministry, I have contemplated \nquitting at least 3 times. The first time was when I had to dedicate \na tiny baby who had passed away after being born three months \npremature. The second was when my wife was diagnosed with cancer, \nwhich I describe in great detail in my book. But the time I most \nseriously considered quitting took place in the living room of a \nchurch member.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe and I had been in almost constant conflict over the course of two \nyears. I was at his house to try to figure out what the problem was, \nand how we might fix it. With my head in my hands, I poured out my \nheart to this man I considered my brother in Christ, sharing all the \nwoes and fears that I had faced that year: the break-ins at my home, \nmy wifes cancer diagnosis, our meager attendance at church. My voice \nchoked with emotion, I confessed to him, I really could use a break, \nyou know?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe looked at me, and with a flat voice dripping with contempt, \nmuttered, You are just so . . . emotional.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeechless, I stared at him. I realized then that he didnt see me as \nI saw him, as a brother in Christ. I was his enemy, worthy only of \nhis derision, not his compassion. As he met my stare with a stony one \nof his own, I pledged to myself, Thats it. I quit. For months and \neven years after this experience, I struggled to comprehend why this \nman viewed me with such disdain. The only thing that I could discern \nwas that his entire small group seemed to collectively hold a pretty \ndim view of me as their pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a long time afterwards, I thought that my experience was unique. \nBut as I spoke with other pastors, I realized that this narrative was \nan altogether common one. In conversation after conversation, fellow \npastors told me their horror stories of how they too had faced \npoisonous and unwavering criticism from a single individual or, more \ncommonly, a single faction of people. And this criticism had been so \nunrelenting that many of these pastors had left their congregations \nor the ministry altogether, sometimes both.\u0014\n\u0014\nI never grasped how widespread this phenomenon was until I came upon \nthis article. It states that a full 28 percent of pastors have been \npushed out of their churches by attacks that originated from a \nrelatively small group of people. This number does not include those \nwho seriously considered leaving but ultimately decided to stay. \nNearly half of those pastors who had left then seriously considered \nabandoning ministry altogether. What is even worse are the lingering \nemotional and spiritual scars that these experiences leave on \npastors. This was definitely the case for me. My confidence, not just \nas a pastor but as a person, plummeted to new depths after that \nencounter, and it has yet to fully recover. I have come to realize \nthat what is often most dangerous to the welfare of pastors is not \nthe attack from outside the church, but the criticisms of cliques \nfrom within.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is often most dangerous to the welfare of pastors is not the \nattack from outside the church, but the criticisms of cliques from \nwithin. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow I want to make clear that I'm not saying that small groups, \neither the formal or informal kind, are evil. They provide a safe and \nintimate place to foster relationships and accountability, making \nthem invaluable. Neither am I saying that people aren't allowed to \nhave their opinions and share them with one another, or that pastors \nare somehow infallible and should never have to face loving \ninstruction, especially when they commit a grave transgression. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut at the same time, people often fail to recognize that a \ntightly-knit group of friends can be the ideal petri dish for a \nparticularly destructive brand of criticism. In fact, it is the very \nthings that make small groups so wonderful that also make them so \ndangerous. The power of small groups is in social cohesion, or when a \ngroup takes on a shared sense of corporate identity. As a means to \npromote that cohesion, members of a group value and affirm other \nmembers, as well as their opinions and beliefs. They also tend to be \nwary of outsiders in order to safeguard the precious safe space that \nthey share. These are not problems in themselves, but actually serve \nto make a group stronger.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut because the group is naturally inclined towards agreement, they \ncan slip into a tendency called group polarization, where the shared \nopinion of the group is stronger and more extreme than the opinion of \nany one individual of that group. And since these groups are prone to \nbeing insulated from outsiders, there is no reference point from \nwhich they can recognize that their view may not be shared by others. \nAdd to this the fact that central figures (like pastors and \npresidents) tend to be the natural target of frustration. And what \nyou discover is that the impression of one individual quickly becomes \nthe sure conviction of many, a conviction that is only intensified \nover multiple regular conversations. I'm certain that more than a few \nof us have witnessed this firsthand, where \"Pastor blew me off one \nSunday,\" becomes \"Pastor is really aloof,\" and finally, \"This pastor \nis just not cutting it. She's got to go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Pastor blew me off one Sunday,\" becomes \"Pastor is really aloof,\" \nand finally, \"This pastor is just not cutting it. She's got to go.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nContrary to what we might think, opinions that are shared by more \nthan one person are not necessarily a sure signpost to the truth \nbecause even groups can fall prey to harmful and ungodly patterns of \nthought and speech. This is not at all just the tendency of \nindividuals. What better example is there than Passion Week, when an \ninfluential and disgruntled few manage to coax a massive crowd into \ncrying out for Jesus crucifixion, the same crowd that five days \nbefore had cried out Hosanna in the highest?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are ways that the church as an organization can regulate this: \nencouraging each group to welcome newcomers or asking groups to \nmultiply so that connections and relationships are more broadly \nshared at the church. But these are not true solutions, only \norganizational attempts at managing the potentially destructive \ndynamics of groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, I believe the answer lies with mature believers who recognize \nwhat is taking place in their circles and work to stop it. It takes \nindividuals who will stand up and lovingly say, You know, I dont \nthink this conversation is really honoring God or that other person. \nWe should bring it up with them directly. Or I love our time \ntogether, but want other people to enjoy it too. What do you think \nabout creating another group out of ours? Or instead of remaining \nsilent when an especially harsh comment is bandied about, speaking up \nto say, I appreciate your point of view, but actually disagree. I \nthink she is doing a great job.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know that this might sound trivial, and little more than helpful \nadvice for church leaders. But it goes far beyond this. The truth is \nthat the lives and hearts of so many pastors are being wrecked by the \npoisonous opinions that are cultivated by cliques. And that means \nthat any church that wants to love and protect their pastor must go \nbeyond gift cards and chocolate cake. The church must address the \nfact that often what is destroying pastors are not the arrows that \ncome from outside its walls, but those which originate from within.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW DO YOU BUILD CHARACTER IN CHILDREN?",
    "words": "The question above was \nasked of FRS by Sheena Jeffers.\u0014\n\u0014\n It is, of course, a deep subject, and you're never really sure what \ninculcates character into a child's or anybody else's life. Here are \na few simplistic answers but still very important.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. You start with what character is. It is the aggregate of features \nand traits that form the individual nature of a person. Good \ncharacter obviously means that these aggregate feature and traits \nmeet some preconceived standard. The Christian standard is not the \nMuslim standard or any other. It almost always has a strong ethical \nor moral character. Some of those things are: honesty, fairness, \ncaring for others, which means not desiring to hurt other people when \nthere is no justification for that behavior, not taking advantage of \npeople who for one reason or another cannot help themselves, not \nabusing weakness in other people. These things include not sexually \nabusing anyone, especially children, and a host of other things  The \nChristian standard is a biblical standard, at least in large part. \nThere is no way a Christian can be considered as developing character \nin their children if they're using a Hindu or Islamic standard, for \nexample. Hindus believe in burning brides on their husbands' funeral \npyres. Muslims believe in stoning women who show any suggestion of \nsexuality in a public way. Even if some of their \"standards\" are like \nthe Christian standard, they are not the same and cannot be put on \nthe same level.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. You must begin with parents who hold--or try to--the basics of \nthis standard. No one is perfect at it, of course. Jane and I have \nhad a strong conviction, as you would expect, that the Christian \nstandard is what we're shooting for. We have wanted to live that way \nand demonstrate to the best of our ability that those things are real \nto us. We've tried in our limited way to be an example of those \nthings I've listed above.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Learning is more caught than it is taught. That is the bottom line \nin learning. It is the ultimate teaching tool, especially for \nchildren. Madison is already learning to say \"Please,\" not because \nthey tell her every day that she ought to. They just do it. She sees \nit, and they encourage her when they need to. But it's already a part \nof her vocabulary, as well as \"thank you,\" which many teenagers have \nnever learned. It does no good to just give books--including the \nBible--to children to teach them how to develop character. They're \ndoing it for good or bad before they ever get to the books.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Jane and I tried to apologize or admit to our children if we said \nor did something that was wrong. Children and adults learn what is \nimportant to you when they hear you apologize for something that \ncontradicts what they have been trying to teach. Clearly, \"I'm sorry \nfor doing that\" tells the observer that that behavior is not part of \nthe accepted standard. I think \"apologizing\" is a great way to help \ndevelop character in a child or a marriage relationship. I've worked \nwith couples who have never apologized to their mate for anything \nthey ever did, even if it was wrong or hurtful.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Give children books or records or puzzles or anything else (fun \nthings) that tell them about the characteristics they've heard from \nyour mouth. Stories about honesty that they can remember are far \nbetter than a lecture on that subject, or any other subject. They can \nremember stories long after they've forgotten the lecture.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Talk to the children and ask them about these things in their \nlives, how they see these things happening at school, on the \nplayground or anywhere else they encounter these issues.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Constantly tell children how valuable, how important, how special \nthey are. It encourages them to participate in life and learn to \nappreciate themselves and others. I will never forget the story of \nthe woman who shared her story of her childhood as a polio victim:  \n\"When my mother left me in Sunday School, I always asked to wear her \nlocket.  She thought I liked the locket.  That wasn't it at all.  I \nknew I wasn't worth coming back for, but I knew she would come back \nfor her locket.\" Children who have no self-worth have no reason to \nreach for growth in character; there's no point to it.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Be with your children as much as you can, not to smother them, but \nto say \"Everything about you matters to me. I'm proud to share your \nvictories. I'm honored to be able to share your pain even if I can't \ntake it away. More than anything, we want you to know that we care \nabout you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Change your own behavior when you need to or see a better way. To \nbe able to come to the end of the journey, still able to say, \"We did \nthe best we could\" puts the mind at peace.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Pray every day that somewhere along the way you've done something \nthat has made a lasting impression on your children \u0014\n\u0014\nIn my opinion, these are things that have to be done to teach \ncharacter and to help develop it. There has never been a day when you \ndidn't see this in your own mother.\u0014",

    "title": "HEROD CUT OFF HIS HEAD BUT NOT HIS VOICE",
    "words": "There is a book on my shelf titled Texts of Terror. Phyllis Trible, \nthe author, has a lot of courage. In this book, she has examined the \nmost awful texts in the Old Testament. These are the pages from the \nBible we wish we could accidentally drop between our desk and the \nwall, lost forever. For example, there is the heart-wrenching story \nof Jephthah's daughter in the book of Judges. The little girl loses \nher life because of her father's foolish promise. There is another \nhorrific story in Judges about a woman who is taken by a group of men \nand tortured, beaten, and raped. When she comes home to her husband \nmore dead than alive, in anger he kills her and cuts her body into \ntwelve pieces which he distributes to the twelve tribes of Israel. \nWho in their right mind wants to preach on a text like that? The \nanswer is: no one. The people who put together the lectionary know \nthis and tend to leave them out. We preachers calmly progress through \na summer of Mark texts on the calling of the disciples, a handful of \nparables, a few miracles, and then boom -- out of the blue, there it \nis -- Mark's own text of terror. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the beheading of John is gruesome. The events leading up \nto it are hard to believe. Herod, the king, definitely was a mixed \nbag. He divorced his wife so he could marry his brother's wife, \nHerodias. Herodias was not just the wife of Herod's half-brother. She \nwas also the daughter of another of Herod's half-brothers. So, when \nHerod married Herodias, he was marrying his sister-in-law and his \nniece at the same time. This was a clear violation of Old Testament \nlaw. John the Baptist publicly denounced the marriage. Herodias was \nfurious. Herod was angry, too, but at least he had a conscience. He \ngenuinely did not want to kill John. Mark tells us that Herod was \nconfused by John's preaching but he liked to listen to him. Herod \nrespected John and feared him because John was a righteous and holy \nman. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, Herod chose cowardice over courage. Rather than stand \nup for what he believed, he gave in to the selfish obsession of his \nwife. Herod ordered John beheaded and the head presented on a platter \nto his wife's daughter who presents it to her mother.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy would the people who put the preaching lectionary together \ninclude this story? Where's the hope? It's clearly a story where evil \ntriumphs over good. The righteous man loses his life. The weak and \nvengeful people get away with murder. It's a sordid tale of anger and \nrevenge, resentment, and death. The name of Jesus is never even \nmentioned.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTo understand this story better it helps to look at what comes right \nbefore. The story of John's beheading follows Jesus' instructions to \nhis disciples. Jesus tells them how to embody God's love in the \nworld. He tells them to expect opposition and trouble. All they need \nto take with them is the gospel and then trust God. By the time Mark \nis telling us the story, Jesus has been preaching his message \nthroughout Galilee. I think Mark is making two points by including \nthe details of John's death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNumber one, there is danger when you tell the truth, especially to \nthose in power. The story of John's death reminds us that being a \nChristian does not guarantee success in this life, but very likely \nwill bring some suffering. Number two, this is a story of the \ndelusions of the powerful. Herod is afraid. He thinks Jesus is John \nraised from the dead. Herod killed John. Now he thinks that John has \ncome back to get him in the form of this new preacher, Jesus. In \nother words, even defenseless, unarmed, decapitated dead men like \nJohn the Baptist can come back to haunt those who use their power for \nevil. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are numerous examples. One of the things that kept Gandhi going \nagainst overwhelming odds was the conviction not just that love would \nconquer, but that evil would defeat itself. Gandhi said this: \"When I \ndespair, I remember that throughout history tyrants and dictators \nhave always failed in the end. Think of it. Always.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOscar Romero was appointed Archbishop of El Salvador because the \nchurch hierarchy thought he was a safe and conservative scholar. He \ndid a complete turnaround and became a champion for the poor and \nspoke out against the oppressive government forces. He won the love \nof the people and the hatred of those in power. He was gunned down on \na Sunday, while elevating the host at the altar of the cathedral. \nInstantly, Romero became an unstoppable spiritual force in the hearts \nof the Salvadoran people and a symbol of freedom and justice around \nthe world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the beheading of John makes it crystal clear that God's \nwork is risky. When you do it, don't expect accolades or success. \nWhen you speak the truth to the powerful there may be a bitter price \nto be paid. But, no matter what may happen, God's plan cannot be \nstopped.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBarbara Brown Taylor tells the story of a teacher who was fired from \nhis job six months short of his retirement after 25 years. It was a \nnasty piece of work on the part of his superiors. They wanted to \npunish him for challenging them and to make him an example for anyone \nelse thinking about trying the same thing. They called it early \nretirement and gave him a party he suffered through. \"I've been to my \nown funeral,\" he said weeks later, recounting the pain of it. \"I lost \nmy students, my program, my livelihood, and my pride. But you know \nwhat? There really is life after death. I'm doing things I always \nwanted to do, but never had time. I'm spending time with my wife. I'm \nfinding energy I thought I'd lost forever. Getting crucified turned \nout better than I thought.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who follow Jesus must not give in to the nave notions that \nbeing faithful to God will be easy. It isn't. John lived for the \ntruth and died because of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Chrysostom was a great preacher of the fifth century. He said of \nthe beheading of John, \"Herod cut off his head, but he did not cut \noff his voice.\" No matter what evil people may do, the voice of the \ngospel will not be silenced. I thank God for those who risk \neverything to make certain it is heard. The question is: are we among \nthem? Amen.\u0014",

    "words": "Historical Ignorance II\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Walter E. Williams | July 21, 2015 \u0014\n\u0014\nWe call the war of 1861 the Civil War. But is that right? A civil war \nis a struggle between two or more entities trying to take over the \ncentral government. Confederate President Jefferson Davis no more \nsought to take over Washington, D.C., than George Washington sought \nto take over London in 1776. Both wars, those of 1776 and 1861, were \nwars of independence. Such a recognition does not require one to \nsanction the horrors of slavery. We might ask, How much of the war \nwas about slavery?\u0014\n\u0014\nWas President Abraham Lincoln really for outlawing slavery? Let's \nlook at his words. In an 1858 letter, Lincoln said, \"I have declared \na thousand times, and now repeat that, in my opinion neither the \nGeneral Government, nor any other power outside of the slave states, \ncan constitutionally or rightfully interfere with slaves or slavery \nwhere it already exists.\" In a Springfield, Illinois, speech, he \nexplained: \"My declarations upon this subject of Negro slavery may be \nmisrepresented but cannot be misunderstood. I have said that I do not \nunderstand the Declaration (of Independence) to mean that all men \nwere created equal in all respects.\" Debating Sen. Stephen Douglas, \nLincoln said, \"I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making \nvoters or jurors of Negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor \nto intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this \nthat there is a physical difference between the white and black \nraces, which I believe will forever forbid the two races living \ntogether on terms of social and political equality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation? Here are his words: \n\"I view the matter (of slaves' emancipation) as a practical war \nmeasure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or \ndisadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.\" He \nalso wrote: \"I will also concede that emancipation would help us in \nEurope, and convince them that we are incited by something more than \nambition.\" When Lincoln first drafted the proclamation, war was going \nbadly for the Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nLondon and Paris were considering recognizing the Confederacy and \nassisting it in its war against the Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was not a universal declaration. It \nspecifically detailed where slaves were to be freed: only in those \nstates \"in rebellion against the United States.\" Slaves remained \nslaves in states not in rebellion  such as Kentucky, Maryland, \nDelaware and Missouri. The hypocrisy of the Emancipation Proclamation \ncame in for heavy criticism. Lincoln's own secretary of state, \nWilliam Seward, sarcastically said, \"We show our sympathy with \nslavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding \nthem in bondage where we can set them free.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln did articulate a view of secession that would have been \nheartily endorsed by the Confederacy: \"Any people anywhere, being \ninclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake \noff the existing government and form a new one that suits them \nbetter. ... Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole \npeople of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any \nportion of such people that can may revolutionize and make their own \nof so much of the territory as they inhabit.\" Lincoln expressed that \nview in an 1848 speech in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nsupporting the war with Mexico and the secession of Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy didn't Lincoln share the same feelings about Southern secession? \nFollowing the money might help with an answer. Throughout most of our \nnation's history, the only sources of federal revenue were excise \ntaxes and tariffs. During the 1850s, tariffs amounted to 90 percent \nof federal revenue. Southern ports paid 75 percent of tariffs in \n1859. What \"responsible\" politician would let that much revenue go?\u0014",

    "title": "HISTORICAL IGNORANCE - (THE CIVIL WAR) - PART 1",
    "words": "By Walter E. Williams | July 14, 2015 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe victors of war write its history in order to cast themselves in \nthe most favorable light. That explains the considerable historical \nignorance about our war of 1861 and panic over the Confederate flag. \nTo create better understanding, we have to start a bit before the \n1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1783 Treaty of Paris ended the war between the colonies and Great \nBritain. Its first article declared the 13 colonies \"to be free, \nsovereign and independent states.\" These 13 sovereign nations came \ntogether in 1787 as principals and created the federal government as \ntheir agent. Principals have always held the right to fire agents. In \nother words, states held a right to withdraw from the pact  secede.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1787 Constitutional Convention, a proposal was made that \nwould allow the federal government to suppress a seceding state. \nJames Madison rejected it, saying, \"A union of the states containing \nsuch an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use \nof force against a state would look more like a declaration of war \nthan an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by \nthe party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which \nit might be bound.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the ratification documents of Virginia, New York and Rhode \nIsland explicitly said they held the right to resume powers delegated \nshould the federal government become abusive of those powers. The \nConstitution never would have been ratified if states thought they \ncould not regain their sovereignty  in a word, secede.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 2, 1861, after seven states seceded and two days before \nAbraham Lincoln's inauguration, Sen. James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin \nproposed a constitutional amendment that read, \"No state or any part \nthereof, heretofore admitted or hereafter admitted into the union, \nshall have the power to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United \nStates.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral months earlier, Reps. Daniel E. Sickles of New York, Thomas \nB. Florence of Pennsylvania and Otis S. Ferry of Connecticut proposed \na constitutional amendment to prohibit secession. Here's a question \nfor the reader: Would there have been any point to offering these \namendments if secession were already unconstitutional?\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the eve of the War of 1861, even unionist politicians saw \nsecession as a right of states. Rep. Jacob M. Kunkel of Maryland \nsaid, \"Any attempt to preserve the union between the states of this \nConfederacy by force would be impractical, and destructive of \nrepublican liberty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Northern Democratic and Republican Parties favored allowing the \nSouth to secede in peace. Just about every major Northern newspaper \neditorialized in favor of the South's right to secede. New York \nTribune (Feb. 5, 1860): \"If tyranny and despotism justified the \nRevolution of 1776, then we do not see why it would not justify the \nsecession of Five Millions of Southrons from the Federal Union in \n1861.\" Detroit Free Press (Feb. 19, 1861): \"An attempt to subjugate \nthe seceded states, even if successful, could produce nothing but \nevil  evil unmitigated in character and appalling in content.\" The \nNew York Times (March 21, 1861): \"There is growing sentiment \nthroughout the North in favor of letting the Gulf States go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe War of 1861 settled the issue of secession through brute force \nthat cost 600,000 American lives. We Americans celebrate Abraham \nLincoln's Gettysburg Address, but H.L. Mencken correctly evaluated \nthe speech: \"It is poetry, not logic; beauty, not sense.\" Lincoln \nsaid the soldiers sacrificed their lives \"to the cause of \nself-determination  that government of the people, by the people, \nfor the people should not perish from the earth.\" Mencken says: \"It \nis difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in \nthe battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the \nConfederates who fought for the right of people to govern themselves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe War of 1861 brutally established that states could not secede. We \nare still living with its effects. Because states cannot secede, the \nfederal government can run roughshod over the U.S. Constitution's \nlimitations of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. States have little or \nno response.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter E. Williams, Prof. of Economics,, George Mason University\t\u0014",

    "title": "HOW JEWS UNDERSTOOD ISA 7:14",
    "words": "The first of the Matthean formula quotations and the most important \nfor our purposes is the citation of Isaiah 7:14 at Matthew 1:23. The \nfollowing observations are crucial.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the pre-Christian interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 seems to have \nseen its fulfillment in Hezekiah, the son and successor of Ahaz. \nApparently, there is no evidence that any early Jew saw this as a \nprophecy about Messiah, much less a prophecy about a virginal \nconception. The Targums do tend to interpret Isaiah 9:5-6 \nmessianically, but it is not clear that they view Isaiah 7:14 in a \nsimilar light.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the Hebrew term 'almh which is used in Isaiah 7:14 (MT) \nrefers to a young woman of marriageable age. Though the idea of \nvirginity is probably implicit in the term, this is not a technical \nterm for virgo intacta. The Hebrew betl comes nearer to being such \na term (Wenham).\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the term 'almh is never used in the OT of a married woman, \nbut does refer to a sexually mature woman. There are no texts in the \nOT where 'almh clearly means one who is sexually active, but it is \npossible that Song of Solomon 6:8 (cf. Prov 30:19) implies this. It \nwould appear then that 'almh normally, if not always, implies a \nvirgin, though the term does not focus on that attribute.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, several of the Greek translations of the OT (i.e., Aq, Sym, \nTheod) translate 'almh with neanis; however, the LXX clearly \ntranslates it with parthenos. It is probably correct to say that if \n'almh did not normally have overtones of virginity, it is difficult \nif not impossible to see why the translators of the LXX used \nparthenos as the Greek equivalent.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, the Hebrew texts speak of \"the young woman,\" so the prophet \nhas some particular person in view.\u0014\n\u0014\nSixth, the Greek term parthenos seems to mean or strongly imply one \nwho is a virgin, but this may not always be the case. In the LXX of \nGenesis 34:3, Dinah is called a parthenos even though the story is \nabout her being seduced by Shechem. It should be noted, however, that \nafter the rape Dinah is called a paidiske (34:4). This text then may \nimply that parthenos sometimes has a meaning broader than \"virgin\" \n(cf. Gen 24:16, 43, 57 MT and LXX), and it is clear that it can be \nvirtually equivalent to 'almh on occasion (Gen 24:43). It may be \ndebated whether in some rare cases parthenos may even mean something \nother than a virgin (cf. Dodd, Carmignac). One must conclude that \nMatthew did not deduce the idea of a virginal conception from the \nIsaianic prophecy, though given a prior belief in such an idea, this \ntext became an appropriate vehicle to express the idea in prophetic \nlanguage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpace does not allow a further treatment of all the formula \nquotations in Matthew 1-2 (cf. Gundry), but mention should be made of \nthe citation of Micah 5:2 in Matthew 2:6. It is a curious fact that \nwhile it is Matthew who cites this text, he never refers to the \nshepherd tradition that Luke records, nor does he make anything of \nJesus being a shepherd figure like David.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Third Evangelist offers us no formula quotations comparable to \nwhat we find in Matthew, and when he does cite the OT in Luke 1-2, it \nis both brief and enigmatic (cf. 2:23-24 citing Ex 13:2, 12, 15 and \nLev 12:8). On the other hand, various of the speeches/songs in Luke \n1-2 are redolent with OT language and are written in the spirit of OT \nprophecy (cf. Lk 1:46-55, 67-79; 2:29-32). In general, however, \nLuke's narrative is not structured on the basis of OT citations or \nallusions, nor does it stress the issue of fulfilled prophecy in the \nmanner of Matthew 1-2.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDictionary of Jesus and the Gospels.\u0014",

    "words": "1 Timothy 2:8-15\u0014\n\u0014\nVerses 815\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular \nhouse of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our \nclosets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on \njourneys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or \nprivate. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger \nat any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without \ndisputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest \nin apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good \nworks are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great \nprice. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than \nelegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of \nserious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should \nspend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than \nin decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner \nunsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, \nis sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best \nornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to \nSt. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; \nfor teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought \nto teach their children at home the principles of true religion. \nAlso, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is \nnecessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As \nwoman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her \nsubjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a \nword of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved \nin child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born \nof a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is \nsubject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much \ngentleness, tenderness, and affection.

His master trailed \nclose behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, \nDavids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky \nin a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids \"must have gone off \non an underground road.\" The name stuck, and the legend of the \nunderground railroad was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a \npart of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic \nexploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated \"conductor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland \nbut escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said \nlater, \"I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was \nfree. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold \nthrough de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 \nreturn trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow \nslaves, boasting \"I never lost a passenger.\" Her guidance of so many \nto freedom earned her the nickname \"Moses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of \nher strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of \nthe weak. \"I always tole God,\" she said, \"'I'm gwine [going] to hole \nstiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her \ncapture, she was never apprehended. \"I can't die but once\" became her \nmotto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of \ndeliverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually \ngoing into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to \nwhom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. \nSlaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be \nmissed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often \nbe late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them \nmissing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired \nby Tubman would take down.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded \nstrict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his \nmaster would likely be forced to reveal information that would \ncompromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a \nrescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to \nreconsider.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she \nreplied, \"Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough \nto betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let \nso many die just for one coward man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close \nwith one: \"I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. \nThey'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped \nright up and went on as well as anybody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led \nslaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading \nher. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, \"I never met any \nperson of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and \ntheir sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as \"one \nof the best and bravest persons on this continentGeneral Tubman as \nwe call her.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Tubman served as a nurse, laundress, and spy \nwith Union forces along the coast of South Carolina. After the war, \nshe made her home in Auburn, New York, and, despite numerous honors, \nspent her last years in poverty. Not until 30 years after the war was \nshe granted a government pension in recognition of her work for the \nFederal Army.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrisianity Today, April 2016 issue\u0014",

You explain the importance of \nmulti-tasking and weighing options. You help us through the tough \nmath homework, and you agree when we point out well never use it. \nYou fight with us, because youve been there. You worry for us, and \nwatch the clock waiting for our curfew. You photograph our prom. You \nwave as we drive away. You give us just enough space to grow.

    "title": "HATRED IS JUST DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY",
    "words": "Oscar Stohr learned as a little boy to be a strict Catholic and a \ngood Nazi. He could thrust up his arm and shout \"Heil Hitler!\" on \ncue. He learned to hate capitalists and particularly Jews. He was \nready to join the Hitler Youth corps when World War II ended. \u0014\n\u0014\nJack Yufe studied Hebrew as a little boy at the synagogue in Port of \nSpain, Trinidad. He learned to shout \"God Save the King\" and fear \nU-boat raids, and he feasted on war movies in which Germans were \nportrayed as the \"scum of the earth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOscar lived with his maternal grandmother in the Sudetenland of \nCzechoslovakia and grew up \"loyal to the thoughts of the Fuhrer.\" \nJack lived with his Jewish merchant father in the Caribbean, then \njoined at 17y an Israeli kibbutz, a community in Israel that was \ntraditionally based on agriculture. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough they live in different parts of the world, Oscar and Jack \nhad much in common. They were very similar in temperament, tempo, the \nway they did things. Both had a taste for the same type foods. They \nboth flushed the toilet before and after using it. Both starred in \nsports and struggled at math. And they looked alike, strangely enough.\u0014\n \u0014\nNow you already know what I'm getting ready to tell you, don't you? \nOscar and Jack were identical twins, separated as babies by their \nparents' bitter divorce. Oscar lived with his maternal grandmother; \nJack with his father. We know that identical twins possess the same \ngenes, any differences between them must come from how they were \nraised. While heredity seems to have an edge in shaping a particular \nbehavior and taste, environment still shapes thought and outlook. \u0014\n\u0014\nJack returned from Israel in 1954 and passed through Germany to meet \nthe brother his father had told him about. The reunion was a near \ndisaster. Oscar, unknowingly a Jew himself, hated Jews, and the Star \nof David that Jack wore was a major irritant in their meeting. Jack \nhated Germans and joyfully anticipated their total destruction. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you think those things happened? They were just doing what \ncomes naturally. They were repeating what they heard their \nparent-figures say until it became a part of their lives. While Oscar \nand Jack differed on many things as a result of their raising, they \nwere united in their conclusion: \"You've got to be taught to hate the \npeople your relatives hate.\" Otherwise you would never have a reason \nto hate the very same people.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestion: Do you hate anybody? Well, if you do, you probably won't \nadmit it. Most Christians won't admit to hating anybody because they \nknow it is so reprehensible, so sickening to God, so they just \n\"intensely dislike\" certain people instead of hating them. Have you \never noticed that? Some of my extended relatives hate anybody who is \nnot white and born in America. In other words, they don't like \nforeigners. Do you have any kinfolk like that? These people don't \nseem to understand that unless you are a Native American, you are a \nforeigner and always will be. But that's another issue. Let's take a \nlook at hatred and what makes it tick. \u0014\n\u0014\nHatred is taught \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one is ever born hating anybody. In this matter, you can rest your \ncase with Oscar and Jack. Born in the same household, born with the \nsame genes, they learned to hate with a perfect passion exactly \nopposite things because they were taught to hate them. Oscar was a \nJew, but not knowing any better, he hated his very own blood. Jack \nhated his own brother and wished for his annihilation because he \ndidn't know any better. You can teach anybody to hate anything if you \ntry, particularly if you get them young enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nCrying Wind is the story of a half-breed Kickapoo Indian girl whose \nparents had abandoned her while on the reservation in South Dakota. \nShe leaves the reservation to seek work. One day while visiting an \nuncle in the hospital, there is mention of a nurse working in the \nhospital who was of the Pawnee tribe. Crying Wind, her uncle, and the \nnurse knew that historically they hated each other, but they didn't \nknow why. The nurse was a kind, thoughtful and personable individual, \nbut nevertheless Crying Wind and her uncle knew they were not \nsupposed to like her. \u0014\n\u0014\nCrying Wind tells the story. In the hot summer of 1845, some Pawnee \nstole horses from a Kickapoo hunting party at Little River. The \nKickapoo were so angry they chased the Pawnee, ran them down, and \nkilled them all. The Kickapoo took back not only their own horses, \nbut all the Pawnee horses too. The Kickapoo made a vow then and there \nto seek vengeance on the Pawnee from that time on. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe uncle says, \"That was 130 years ago, A long time ago. A long time \nto be angry.\" Then he says, \"I knew the Kickapoo hated the Pawnee, \nbut I couldn't remember why.\" He didn't need to remember why. Hatred \nfunctions well without rhyme or reason. It's just \"doing what comes \nnaturally.\"\u0014",

    "title": "HYMN WRITER AUGUSTUS TOPLADY--ROCK OF AGES",
    "words": "Hymn Writer Augustus Toplady\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustus Montague Toplady, clergyman and writer, was born November 4, \n1740, at Farnham, about 20 miles southwest of Windsor, England. He \nstudied at the Westminster School for a while, but was sent to \nIreland in 1755, the same year as his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Toplady was taken with John Wesley's teachings, but by 1758, \nhe had become an extreme Calvinist and had harsh words for Methodist \ntheology. Passionate for the Lord, he prayed, \"God keep me from being \na mere scholar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady received his degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts \nfrom Trinity College. Ordained deacon in 1762, he was licensed to the \ncuracy of Blagdon the same year. Two years later he was ordained as a \npriest, and until 1766 served as curate at Farleigh, Hungerford. For \nthe next two years he held the benefice of Harpford with Venn-Ottery, \nand for two years after that, of Broad Hembury. During 1775 he took a \nleave to minister to the French Calvinist Reformed Church in Orange \nStreet, London.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first published work was Poems on Sacred Subjects, Dublin, 1759. \nHis major works were the Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of \nthe Church of England (1774) and The Church of England Vindicated \nfrom the Charge of Arminianism (1769.) He was prone to polemics and \nwas cutting in his opposition to Wesley followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady suffered from tuberculosis. As his death neared, he sensed \nGod's presence. \"O what a day of sunshine this has been to me! I have \nnot words to express it. It is unutterable. O my friends, how good is \nGod!\" The day he died, he was calling, \"Come, Lord Jesus, come \nquickly!\" He told his friends that he could not live much longer for \nno mortal man could live after seeing the glories of God that he had \nseen. He was not quite thirty-eight when he died on August 11, 1778, \nbut his short life-span was enough to produce one of the most beloved \nof all hymns--Rock of Ages:\u0014\n\u0014\nRock of Ages cleft for me,\u0014\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\u0014\nLet the water and the blood\u0014\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed\u0014\nBe of sin the double cure;\u0014\nCleanse me from its guilt and power. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is said to have come to him when he stepped into a cleft of \nrock to take shelter from a storm, but the evidence does not bear \nthis out. The first appearance of that particular story was 70 years \nafter his death. More likely the hymn came from his meditation on God \nas our rock, which was a frequent theme in his sermons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew if any today read the the sermons or other books Augustus Toplady \nwrote, but we still sing his hymn. It has remained a favorite. Sung \nin churches or at home, it speaks of Christ's mercy to all ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCook, Paul E. G.

    "words": "Backed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Harry Emerson Fosdick's New York \nCity congregation determined to build a new church which was to be \nbeautiful beyond words. The Riverside church was the outcome.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry had agreed to lead it on three conditions: \u0014\n\u0014\n(1) The only requirement for membership will be affirmation of faith \nin Christ. \u0014\n(2) The church must be interdenominational.\u0014\n(3) The church must be a very large building with a more expansive \nministry in a neighborhood crucial to the livelihood of the whole \ncity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis day, October 5, 1930, saw the celebration of the first service \nat Riverside Church, New York City. To mark the occasion, Harry wrote \nthe hymn \"God of Grace and God of Glory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod of grace and God of glory, \u0014\nOn Thy people pour Thy power. \u0014\nCrown Thine ancient church's story, \u0014\nBring her bud to glorious flower. \u0014\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage, \u0014\nFor the facing of this hour, \u0014\nFor the facing of this hour. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough some of the verses of his hymn mentioned Christ (\"Lo! the \nhosts of evil 'round us, Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways...\"), \nHarry's Christ was hardly the Jesus of Christian history, for he \ndenied the virgin birth and a literal second coming in the clouds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the Riverside church was constructed after Harry left a \nPresbyterian church in which he had ministered for many years. His \nteachings had strayed too far from his denomination's doctrine. The \nleading liberal pastor of his day, Harry flatly rejected all of the \ntenets of fundamentalism in a sermon titled \"Shall the \nFundamentalists Win?\" Early in his ministry, Harry rejected the type \nof preaching which explains the Bible verse by verse, or which traces \na topic through the Bible. Having read a book during his school days \nwhich claimed that the Bible had held back progress, Harry did not \naccept Scripture as God's infallible word.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe concluded that sermons were not to deliver or explain God's word. \nInstead, \"Every sermon should have for its main business the head-on \nconstructive meeting of some problem which was puzzling minds, \nburdening consciences, distracting lives...\" Those who attended his \nsermons were almost certain to hear him say things like, \"I would \nrather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than \nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it,\" or \"He \nwho chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to. It \nis the means that determines the end.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry had chosen his road. It was a road of the social gospel and of \nsermons that owed more to psychology than to spirituality. He wrote \nover forty books distilling his liberal views, which included \nacceptance of Darwin's evolutionary ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoincidentally, Harry died on this day, October 5, 1969, thirty-nine \nyears to the day after the dedication of his Gothic cathedral.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnker, Roy M. \"Fosdick, Harry Emerson.\" Dictionary of American \nBiography.

    "title": "HITLER:ASCENT   -- AN EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK",
    "words": "HITLER by Volker Ullrich\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler As Human Being\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpt (pgs. 382-386)\u0014\nAs a rule, people who got a close look at the Fhrer for the first \ntime were rarely impressed. After a meeting with Hitler in December \n1931, the industrialist Gnther Quandt deemed him the very definition \nof average. Sefton Delmer described him as an everyday person \nreminiscent of a travelling salesman or a junior officer. As we saw, \nthe American reporter Dorothy Thompson called Hitler the exact \nprototype of the little man on the street. William Shirer, the \ncorrespondent for Americas Universal News Service, also came away \ndisappointed after seeing Hitler in September 1934 at the Nuremberg \nrally. His face, Shirer wrote in his diary, had no particular \nexpression at allI expected it to be strongerand for the life of me \nI could not quite comprehend what hidden springs he undoubtedly \nunloosened in the hysterical mob which was greeting him so wildly. \u0014\n\u0014\nHitlers appearance was hardly winning. Finance Minister von Krosigk, \nwho met Hitler for the first time when the new chancellor was sworn \nin on 30 January 1933, recalled the Fhrers face as being \nunremarkable. There was nothing harmonious about his features, nor \ndid they have the irregularity that expresses individual human \nspirit, Krosigk wrote. A lock of hair that flopped down over his \nforehead and the rudiments of a moustache only two fingers wide gave \nhis appearance something comic. Hitlers moustache was the feature \nthat everyone noticed. Early on, Hanfstaengl had urged him to shave \nit off, arguing that it was fodder for caricaturists. My moustache \nwill be all the rage one dayyou can bet on that, Hitler replied. \nAround 1925 or 1926 he told Adelheid Klein, a friend in Munich: \nImagine my face without the moustache! . . . My nose is much too \nbig. I have to soften it with the moustache! Indeed, Hitlers large, \nfleshy nose was rather disproportionate to the rest of his face. \nKlaus Mann called it the most foul and most characteristic aspect \nof Hitlers physiognomy. For his part Albert Speer claimed that he \nonly noticed how ugly and disproportionate Hitlers face was in the \nfinal months of the Third Reich, when the Fhrers appeal was \ndeclining. How did I not notice that in all the years? he wondered \nin his Spandau prison cell in late November 1946. Curious! \u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost everyone who came into contact with Hitler was struck by \nanother feature. Upon seeing the young Hitler for the first time in \n1919, Karl Alexander von Mller immediately noted his large, \nlight-blue, fanatically and coldly gleaming eyes. Lieselotte \nSchmidt, an assistant and nanny to Winifred Wagner, had a different \nimpression. Like her mistress, she admired Hitler and found that his \neyes shone with goodness and warmth. One glance from his lovely \nviolet-blue eyes was enough to sense his gentle temperament and good \nheart, Schmidt said in 1929. Otto Wagener, the economic adviser who \nentered Hitlers service that same year and still professed his \nadmiration of the Fhrer in a British POW camp in 1946, recalled: \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the first moment, his eyes captivated me. They were clear and \nlarge and calm. He stared at me full of self-confidence. But his gaze \ndid not come from his eyeballs. On the contrary, I felt it came from \nsomewhere far deeper, from infinity. You could read nothing in his \neyes. But they spoke and wanted to say something. \u0014\n\u0014\nChrista Schroeder, one of Hitlers secretaries from 1933 onwards, was \nsomewhat more sober: I found Hitlers eyes very expressive. They \nlooked interested and probing and always became more animated \nwhenever he spoke. The playwright Gerhart Hauptmann also noted \nHitlers strange and lovely eyes after meeting the Fhrer at the \ninauguration of the Reich Culture Chamber in November 1933. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhether people perceived Hitlers gaze as cold or benevolent, \nimpenetrable or friendly and inquisitive depended both on the given \nsituation and their political views. What admirers praise as the \npower of his eyes strikes neutral observers as a greedy stare without \nthat hint of decency that makes a gaze truly compelling, wrote the \nHitler detractor Konrad Heiden. His gaze repels more than it \ncaptivates. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut even critical observers sometimes praised his eyes. Hitlers \neyes were startling and unforgettable, wrote Martha Dodd, the \ndaughter of the U.S. ambassador to Germany, William Edward Dodd, \nafter being introduced to Hitler by Hanfstaengl in 1933. They seemed \npale blue in colour, were intense, unwavering, hypnotic. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlongside his eyes, Hitlers hands attracted the most attention. So \nexpressive in their movements as to compete with the eyes was how \nHouston Stewart Chamberlain put it in a fawning letter to Hitler in \n1923. For Krosigk, Hitlers hands were nervous, delicate and almost \nfeminine. In 1933, when the philosopher Karl Jaspers voiced doubts \nas to whether someone as uneducated as Hitler could lead Germany, his \ncolleague Martin Heidegger replied: Education is irrelevant . . . \njust look at those lovely hands. Many of Heideggers contemporaries \nshared his admiration for the Fhrers hands. In an article for the \nDecember 1936 edition of New Literature, the head of German radio \ncharacterised Hitlers delicate hands as being the tools of an \nartist and great creator. And in October 1942, while imprisoned in \na British POW camp, General Ludwig Crwell opined: His hands are \ntruly strikinglovely hands . . . Hes got the hands of an artist. My \neyes were always drawn to his hands. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut more impressive than his eyes and hands was Hitlers talent for \nspeaking. His appearance may have made him seem average and everyday, \nbut as soon as he took to the stage, he was transformed into a \ndemagogue the likes of which Germany had never known. Admirers and \ndetractors were in absolute agreement on this point. In his essay \nBrother Hitler, Thomas Mann attributed Hitlers rise to his \neloquence, which although unspeakably base, has huge sway over the \nmasses. Heiden wrote of an incomparable barometer of mass moods, \nwhile Otto Strasser spoke of an unusually sensitive seismograph of \nthe soul. Strasser also compared Hitler to a membrane broadcasting \nthe most secret longings and emotions of the masses. Krosigk \nconcurred. He sensed what the masses were longing for and translated \nit into firebrand slogans, the Reich finance minister wrote. He \nappealed to the instincts slumbering in peoples unconsciousness and \noffered something to everyone. The American journalist Hubert R. \nKnickerbocker, who had encountered Hitler as a seemingly polite, \nsmall-time politician in the NSDAPs Munich headquarters in 1931, was \nastonished by a public appearance that same evening. He was an \nevangelist speaking at a tent meeting, the Billy Sunday of German \npolitics, the Pulitzer Prize winner wrote. Those he had converted \nfollowed him, laughed with him, felt with him. Together they mocked \nthe French. Together they hissed off the Republic. Eight thousand \npeople became one instrument on which Hitler played his symphony of \nnational passion. As Knickerbocker realised, the secret to Hitlers \nsuccess lay in the mutual identification between speaker and \naudiencein the exchange of individual and collective sensitivities \nand neuroses.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not only the faithful whom Hitler managed to put under his \nspell. There wont be anyone like him for quite some time, Rudolf \nHess wrote in 1924 while imprisoned in Landsberg, a man who can \nsweep away both the most left-wing lathe operator and the right-wing \ngovernment official in a single mass event. Hesss view was no \nexaggeration. Numerous contemporaries who rejected Hitler and his \nparty struggled to resist the lure of Hitlers overwhelming \nrhetoricindeed, some succumbed to it. In his memoirs, the historian \nGolo Mann described the impression a Hitler speech made on him as a \n19-year-old student in the autumn of 1928. I had to steel myself \nagainst the energy and persuasive force of the speaker, Mann wrote. \nA Jewish friend of mine, whom I had brought along, was unable to \nresist. Hes right, he whispered in my ear. How many times had I \nheard this phrase Hes right uttered by listeners from whom I would \nhave least expected it? \u0014\n\u0014\nHitlers talent for persuasive oration gave him a hypnotic sway over \ncrowds. Part of his secret was his unusually powerful and variable \nvoice. Those who only know Hitler from the events of later years, \nafter he had mutated into an immoderately thundering dictator and \ndemagogue at the microphone, have no idea what a flexible and \nmellifluous instrument his natural, non-amplified voice was in the \nearly years of his political career, noted Hanfstaengl. It was \nHitlers voice, at a speech in Weimar in March 1925, that won over \nBaldur von Schirach, later the Nazis Reich youth leader, at the age \nof 18. It was a voice unlike any other I had heard from a public \nspeaker, Schirach recalled. It was deep and rough, resonant as a \ncello. His accent, which we thought was Austrian but was actually \nLower Bavarian, was alien to central Germany and compelled you to \nlisten. he called himself the greatest actor in Europe, Krosigk \nrecalled. That statement was one of the excessive flights of fancy to \nwhich the dictator became increasingly prone in his later years. \nNonetheless, Hitler had an undeniable ability to don different masks \nto suit various occasions and to inhabit changing roles. He could be \na charming conversation partner who kissed womens hands, a friendly \nuncle who gave children chocolate, or a man of the people who could \nshake the callused hands of farmers and artisans, remarked Albert \nKrebs, the Gauleiter of Hamburg. When invited to the Bechstein and \nBruckmann salons or to afternoon tea at the Schirachs in Weimar, he \nwould play the upstanding, suit-and-tie-wearing bourgeois to fit in \nwith such social settings. At NSDAP party conferences, he dressed in \na brown shirt and cast himself as a prototypical street fighter who \nmade no secret of his contempt for polite society.\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler adapted his speeches to peoples expectations. In front of the \nReichstag, he talked like a wise statesman. When he spoke to a circle \nof industrialists he was a man of moderation. To women he was the \ngood-humoured father who loved children, while in front of large \ncrowds he was a fiery volcano. To his fellow party members he was the \ntruest and bravest soldier who sacrificed himself and was therefore \nallowed to demand sacrifices of others. Andr Franois-Poncet, who \nwitnessed Hitlers various appearances at the Nuremberg rally in \n1935, was impressed by the Fhrers ability to intuit the mood of \neach given audience. He found the words and tone he needed for all \nof them, the French ambassador remarked. He ran the gamut from \nbiting to melodramatic to intimate and lordly. The man who succeeded \nFranois-Poncet in 1938, Robert Coulondre, was also surprised by the \nman he met at the Berghof retreat when he presented his letter of \ncredence in November. I was expecting a thundering Jove in his \ncastle and what I got was a simple, gentle, possibly shy man in his \ncountry home, Coulondre reported.

As Hans Schlaffer left the Anabaptist \nmeeting in Schwaz, he was headed up the Inn River toward his home in \nthe mountains of Austria. There he planned to sit out the winter \nmonths until Spring, when he would renew his ministry. But the plans \nof this former Roman Catholic priest received a rude shock.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn December 5, 1527, Hans Schlaffer was arrested by local Roman \nCatholic authorities. In nearby Frundsberg Castle, they tortured him \nand priests examined him about infant-baptism. Hans said that \naccording to scripture, a man had to \"hear, understand, believe, and \nreceive\" God's word before being baptized. As he saw it, this alone \ncounted as Christian baptism. Children need not be baptized and the \nLord did not command it because they were already his. He might have \nadded, as he had written--and was now demonstrating-- that \"the \nChristian life is not child's play; but bitter earnestness, truth, \ncourage and saintliness must be there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked on what foundation the Anabaptists rested, he replied, \n\"Our faith, actions, and baptism rest on nothing else than the \ncommandment of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHans was known as a master of prayer. On the day he was arrested, he \nhad been teaching his hearers about prayer. Two months later, on the \nnight before his execution (his head was cut off), he was still \nfocused on prayer.\u0014",

    "words": "Hasty Call to Assemble at Upsalla\u0014\nJanuary 9, 1593\u0014\n\u0014\nWould you die for your faith? In sixteenth century Europe, many \nordinary people did.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 16th century England, \"Bloody Mary,\" as she was called, openly \nexecuted hundreds of Protestants and more died in her prisons. In \n16th century France, Catholics massacred thousands of Huguenot \nfamilies in a surprise attack that took place on St. Bartholomew's \nDay. Catholic Spain perpetrated atrocities on the Protestant \nNetherlands because the little states disagreed with her on matters \nof faith. Protestants retaliated with atrocities such as the Gorcum \nmartyrdoms. Across Europe, blood flowed in clashes between Catholics \nand Protestants. In 1593, the Swedes had reason to suspect that their \nturn was coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nLutheranism had gained a strong hold over the minds of the \nScandinavian people. What if a Roman Catholic ruler were to take \nSweden's throne? Would he butcher Protestants? It looked all too \nlikely. Sigismund III of Poland was in line to become Sweden's next \nmonarch. He was an ardent Catholic who had already kicked the \nProtestant Reformation out of Poland. What is more, he was on his way \nto Stockholm with 20,000 crowns in his pocket, a gift from the pope \nto restore Catholicism to Sweden.\u0014\n\u0014\nSerious trouble can sometimes be averted by timely action. In Sweden, \na small group of men discussed the danger. They thought they saw a \nway to prevent disaster. These men were Lutheran leaders and Charles, \nDuke of Sudermania (Finland), who was a Protestant and the uncle of \nSigismund III. The men went into action.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, January 9th, 1593, messengers raced into the Swedish \ncountryside with an urgent summons for all the clergy to assemble at \nUppsala within a month. Uppsala, a few miles north of Stockholm, had \nonce been a Viking burial ground, but now was home to Sweden's \narchbishops, who, since 1531, had been Lutheran.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the frigid Scandinavian winter, scores of churchmen heeded \nthe call. Three hundred and six clergymen assembled for the meeting \n(called a diet) which opened on March 1st. Members of the Council of \nState were also in attendance. On March 10th, the assembly decreed \nthat all future monarchs of Sweden must be Lutheran. It declared the \nLutheran Augsburg Confession the only legal, binding confession for \nthe Swedish church, its subjects, and its rulers. Before Sigismund \ncould land in Stockholm, the Swedes chose Charles as Regent of Sweden \nand head of the Council of State.\u0014\n\u0014\nSigismund wanted to hold onto both Poland and Sweden but could hardly \nbe a Catholic in one country and a Lutheran in the other. He turned \nto his Jesuit confessors for advice. They urged him to subscribe to \nthe Augsburg Confession for the good he could accomplish. Sigismund \nswore to uphold the decision of Uppsala. Thereupon the Swedes crowned \nhim in 1594. His coronation oath included a promise to preserve the \nSwedish Church. He immediately broke his word, appointing a Catholic \ngovernor of Stockholm, founding Catholic schools, and ruling Sweden \nthrough Polish Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSweden's Parliament was probably the oldest and certainly one of the \nmost independent in Europe. It represented all four groups of the \npopulation: peasants, burghers, clergy, and nobles. Parliament \nconfirmed Charles as regent, to govern when Sigismund returned to \nPoland. After Sigismund sailed away late in 1594, Sweden's peasants \npetitioned for a single king, saying Sigismund had forfeited his \nright to rule. Charles was unwilling to lead a revolution, and \nSigismund might have remained king (in name at least), except that he \nraised an army to attack his own country. Charles met him near \nLinkping (between the Swedish coast and Vattar) in 1597 and utterly \ndefeated him. The Swedes made Charles their king. The church remained \nhighly independent. More importantly, Charles' son, Gustavus \nAdolphus, became one of the greatest of the Protestant generals and \nsaved their cause during the Thirty Years' War that soon enveloped \nEurope. The urgent call that went out from Uppsala on this date, had \nbeen timely indeed as far as the reformers were concerned.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nFletcher, C. R. L.

    "title": "HARRIET TUBMAN BIOGRAPHY",
    "words": "\u0014\nHarriet Tubman (1822  10 March 1913) was an escaped slave who became \na leading figure in the abolitionist movement. Harriet Tubman also \nserved as a spy for the US army during the civil war and was an \nactive participant in the struggle for women's suffrage.\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman was born,Araminta Ross, to slave parents who lived on \nplantations in Maryland. Little is known about her family background \nand ancestry, but her maternal grandmother came to the US on a slave \nship from Africa (possibly from modern day Ghana).\u0014\n\u0014\nHer parents Rit and Ben Ross had nine children together, but three of \nHarriet's sisters were sold at an early age by their owners, she \nnever saw them again.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as a young child Harriet was responsible for looking after her \nyounger siblings, because her mother was too busy working as a cook. \nHarriet was also hired as a nurse maid to a Miss Susan. She was \nfrequently whipped by her overseers  leading to scars which would \nlast all her life. For periods of time, she was also sent out to work \nfor a planter  checking muskrat traps and later farming tasks, such \nas plowing and moving logs.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one occasion, Tubman was hit in the head by a stone thrown by a \nslave owner. The slave owner was aiming at another slave, but the \nstone hit Tubman in the back of her head  cracking her skull and \nleading to lifelong headaches, epileptic seizures and dreams / \nvisions. Tubman later attributed her bushy unkempt hair for reducing \nimpact of the stone and saving her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAround 1844, Harriet married a black man named John Tubman. Around \nthis time, she adopted her mother's maiden name Harriet  (in place \nof her childhood name Araminta)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1849, Tubman's slave owner  Edward Brodress died. This raised the \nlikelihood Tubman would be sold, and the family split up. With her \ntwo brothers, Ben and Henry, she decided to escape from the large \nplantation in Caroline County were they were hired out to. The escape \nwas successful, but after a few weeks, her brothers had misgivings \nbecause they wanted to return to their children; Tubman was forced to \nreturn with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, soon after, Tubman escaped for a second time. With the help \nof the Underground Railroad, she took a 90 mile route northeast along \nthe Choptank River towards Pennsylvania. The journey on foot could \nhave taken a couple of weeks, with great care being needed to avoid \nslave catchers  who could gain a bounty for catching any escaped \nslaves. After reaching Pennsylvania, she expressed her tremendous joy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if \nI was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the \nsun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt \nlike I was in Heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Philadelphia, Tubman took on odd jobs to earn some money, but she \nwanted to return to Maryland to rescue the rest of her family. In her \nown words\u0014\n\u0014\nI had crossed de line of which I had so long been dreaming. I was \nfree; but dere was no one to welcome me to de land of freedom, I was \na stranger in a strange land, and my home after all was down in de \nold cabin quarter, wid de ole folks, and my brudders and sisters. But \nto dis solemn resolution I came; I was free, and dey should be free \nalso; I would make a home for dem in de North, and de Lord helping \nme, I would bring dem all dere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis task of retrieving slaves was made more difficult by the \nFugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished anyone helping \nslaves to escape  even in states which outlawed slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, with the help of other abolitionist activists, such as \nThomas Garrett, she made repeated trips to Maryland to rescue \ndifferent members of her family. Because of her exploits, she earned \nthe nickname Moses referring to the Biblical character who escaped \nslavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever her husband chose not to escape with Tubman, because in her \nabsence he had married another woman, named Caroline. Over the next \ndecade, Tubman helped rescue over 70 slaves, in about 13 expeditions \n(and offering advice to many more). She often travelled in the darker \nwinter months, making it easier to travel incognito by night. Because \nof the dangers on the road, she always took a revolver with her. She \nwas also willing to use it to threaten any escaped slave who wished \nto go back because she knew returning would endanger all the \nescapees. She was proud never to lose an escaping slave on her \nexpeditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I \ncan say what most conductors can't say  I never ran my train off the \ntrack and I never lost a passenger.  Harriet Tubman\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the growing racial tension and the stricter laws regarding \nescaped slaves, many sought to escape the US altogether moving to \nSouthern Ontario in Canada. Tubman took part in such travels, helping \nguide parties of former slaves north.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick Douglass, who was a noted activist against slavery, praised \nTubman for her role in helping slaves. In particular he praised her \ncourage and willingness to work without recognition. He said of \nTubman:\u0014\n\u0014\nExcepting John Brownof sacred memoryI know of no one who has \nwillingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved \npeople than you have\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1a big \nelement of Tubman's life was her strong religious faith. From her \nchildhood, she had learnt aural biblical stories, and although she \ncouldn't read, she felt a strong faith in the presence and guidance \nof God. She related receiving strong visions and clear messages \ncoming from God, and on the dangerous missions, she trusted in the \nguidance and protection of God to succeed in her mission.\u0014\nIn 1858, she met the radical abolitionist John Brown, who advocated \nviolence to promote the ending of slavery. Although Tubman never \npromoted violence herself, she was sympathetic to the aims of John \nBrown and assisted him in finding willing volunteers. Brown's raid on \nHarper Ferry, Virginia failed and he was executed, but Tubman praised \nhis courage in death for trying to fight the institution of slavery.\u0014\nCivil war\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the outbreak of the civil war, Tubman saw a Union victory as a way \nto advance the cause of abolition. She served as a nurse in Port \nRoyal, treating soldiers suffering dysentery and small pox.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article and photos, see My Documents/ Harriet Tubman \nBiography\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

What she hadn't planned on was the cancellation of the \nprogram. After convincing the university to allow her to study, \nMelching couldn't help but fall in love with all that Senegal \noffered. Rather than returning home, however, Melching extends her \nstay and secures a position as an Peace Corps employee. She starts a \nschool to teach the local children, focusing on them reading stories \nthat reflect their own culture and language, rather than stories of \nEuropean children who share little with their Senegalese peers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis venture quickly leads to another and before Melching knows it, \nshe has embedded herself into the Senegal culture, learned the \nlanguage, and established an NGO named Tostan to help educate the \nwomen and children of the nation. While she set out to improve the \nquality of life, it becomes apparent that one issue needs attention - \nthat of FGC (female genital cutting). Remarkably, after much effort, \nand devoted educational efforts Melching and the women of the \nvillages begin to notice a change in the FGC tradition. The women \nfeel empowered, and slowly begin to convince others that a change is \nneeded.\u0014",

    "words": "How the Prophet \nHabakkuk Built an Anti-Fragile Faith\u0014\n\u0014\n                                        Lessons on worshiping a \nconsistently unpredictable God. \u0014\n\u0014\nKrish Kandiah/ February 17, 2017 \u0014\n\u0014\nMy son, Luke, is a brilliant soccer player. Even at a young age, he \nhad fantastic control skills and a powerful kick. Luke is also a \nbrilliant artist, appreciating the beauty of the world around him and \ntranslating that onto paper with pencil and paint. Unfortunately, \nthis combination was lethal. Lukes team members had no idea whether \nhe had his eye on the ball or was observing a falling leaf or a \npink-petaled daisy. One minute he would be dedicated and deft, the \nnext distant and distracted. By the time he turned five, it was made \nclear to my son that he had no future in the cutthroat world of our \nlocal boys soccer team. Unpredictability, it seems, makes \nrelationships, trust, teamworkand coming out on topvirtually \nimpossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe all know that God never lets us down, that he is utterly reliable \nand consistent. The Bible teaches that God is immutable; unchanging \nin his nature, character, and purpose. He is the same yesterday, \ntoday, and forever and does not change like shifting shadows. He \nis our Alpha and Omega, beginning and end; his love endures forever. \nSo what do we do when he seems distracted? What do believers do when \nthe circumstances of our lives make God seem erratic, distant, and \nunpredictable?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Scripture, Gods people do not always experience God as \npredictable. God is more likely, it seems, to surprise and shock us. \nWe ask him for one thing, and he gives us another. How can we trust a \nconsistently unpredictable God who continually confounds our \nexpectations?\u0014\n\u0014\nTalking Back to God?\u0014\n\u0014\nEconomist Nassim Taleb describes how governments face a similar \ndilemma in the face of what he calls black swan events. These are \nincidents that nobody can predict; they are random yet game-changing, \nsuch as the 9/11 tragedy, the social impact of the worldwide web, the \nrecent global economic crisis, or shocking political results. How can \na government effectively plan for such unexpected events? Taleb \ncoined the phrase anti-fragile to encapsulate a quality of \nresilience and security that can be built into economic systems so \nthey can withstand unforeseeable disruptive events. This seems like a \ngood category to apply to faith-building when we are dealing with a \nGod who constantly surprises.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophet Habakkuk learned how to build an anti-fragile faith the \nhard way. He lived in tumultuous times, just like ours. For him war \nand conflict were a very present reality. Habakkuks homeland, the \nsouthern kingdom of Judah, lay in the path of mighty King \nNebuchadnezzars advancing army. Jerusalem, the capital city, was \nunder constant threat of invasion, so Habakkuks people were living \nin fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as if the threat of hostile takeover wasnt bad enough, things \nwere not going well in the Promised Land. In the face of prophetic \nwarnings, idolatry, injustice, and wrongdoing were widespread \nthroughout Judah. In despair, Habakkuk opens his heart to God:\u0014\n\u0014\nHow long, Lord, must I call for help,\u0014\nbut you do not listen?\u0014\nOr cry out to you, Violence!\u0014\nbut you do not save?\u0014\nWhy do you make me look at injustice?\u0014\nWhy do you tolerate wrongdoing?\u0014\nDestruction and violence are before me;\u0014\nthere is strife, and conflict abounds.\u0014\nTherefore the law is paralyzed,\u0014\nand justice never prevails.\u0014\nThe wicked hem in the righteous,\u0014\nso that justice is perverted. (Hab. 1:14)\u0014\n\u0014\nWere not used to prophets speaking back to God. We imagine them with \ntheir spiritual lives in order, expressing grand pronouncements with \ngreat gravitas. But the book of Habakkuk kicks off with an unedited \nmoan about the state of the world. This is a prayer of protest, \nimpatience, and raw emotion. Habakkuk is wrestling with how to relate \nto an unpredictable God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Bad to Worse\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter each of Habakkuks complaints comes Gods replies. The \nback-and-forth structure of the book is a wonderful picture of God \nengaging in real conversation with his people. He appreciates that we \nstruggle with his unpredictability, and he graciously listens and \nresponds to our questions and complaints.\u0014\n\u0014\nHabakkuk protests the contradictions he sees. There is corruption \nwithin the very legal system that was supposed to protect the nation \nfrom corruption. The impact of the righteous is nullified by that of \nthe wicked. Why does God put up with it? Why does God make his people \nput up with it? Why is God inactive in the face of unrelenting evil? \nGod assures Habakkuk that he will intervene:\u0014\n\u0014\nLook at the nations and watch\u0014\nand be utterly amazed.\u0014\nFor I am going to do something in your days\u0014\nthat you would not believe,\u0014\neven if you were told.\u0014\nI am raising up the Babylonians,\u0014\nthat ruthless and impetuous people,\u0014\nwho sweep across the whole earth\u0014\nto seize dwellings not their own. (Hab. 1:56)\u0014\n\u0014\nHabakkuk thought he could rely on God to oppose the wicked and \nchampion the cause of the needy. But God seems to do nothing at all, \nand when he promises to intervene, it is not good news. The \nunexpected, unbelievable, unpredictable something that God is about \nto do is not to usher in great blessing, but to exact terrible \njudgment on his people through that pagan neighboring superpower, \nBabylon. How can we trust a God who can take a bad situation and make \nit a thousand times worse?\u0014\n\u0014\nWorshiping an Unpredictable God\u0014\n\u0014\nWe naturally want to trust in Gods overarching control, but this \nkind of trust begins to feel impossible when we face disappointments \nso disruptive that our faith, life, or very identity lies in ruins.\u0014\n\u0014\nOld Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann describes three stages in \nthe life of our faith. Our faith begins with a focus on security, \ncounting on God to provide for us emotionally, physically, and \nspiritually. Inevitably, God shocks us with some unexpected turn of \nevents, whether a death, a health problem, or a national crisis. Our \nfaith becomes painfully disoriented. Finally though, once it seems as \nif trust in God has been shattered, faith can be reoriented, often in \nsurprising ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding an anti-fragile faith does not mean avoiding challenges \nbut rather finding a way to see through them to something greater on \nthe other side. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians spend most of their lives in the first phase. \nSecurely oriented in their faith, they have no need to dig too deep \ninto what they believe or why. But when a black-swan event comes \nalongpersonal suffering, the fall from grace of a church leader, or \nsimply a question that wobbles their understanding of one particular \ndoctrinethe resulting painful disorientation can lead to the \ntemptation to drop out of church altogether. Their faith may seem \nirrevocably broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut disruptive events God initiates do not always debilitate faith. \nSometimes they deepen it. This potential third phase, a surprising \nreorientation, results in an anti-fragile faith. Rather than a \nposture that avoids challenges, the posture of anti-fragile faith \nfinds a way to see through current circumstances and anticipate \nsomething greater on the other side.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree clues in the story of Habakkuk help us develop an anti-fragile \nfaith that is able to face up to, rather than shy away from, the \nuncertainties God sends into our lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first clue relates to the future: Gods first response to \nHabakkuks complaint is to tell him to wait (1:5). Waiting is a \ndifficult thing in a culture of immediacy. When it comes to \nsustainability, justice, purity, and personal growth, we want it now. \nBut God exhorts Habakkuk to play the long game. Things may seem \nunpalatable in the short term, but God promises that one day there \nwill be a reckoning. God calls us to patient endurance, to trust that \nhis apparent unpredictability will ultimately be proven to be utter \nconsistency.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur second clue has to do with the past: Habakkuk remembers. We see \nHabakkuk recounting Gods rescue of his people from Egyptian tyranny \n(3:1215). He remembers details of the soldiers, with their horses, \narrows, and chariots, defeated in the waters of the Red Sea. He \nimagines how Gods arrival from Mount Paran must have appeared to \nbystandershis splendor like the rising sun. Habakkuk remembers the \npillar of fire representing Gods faithful presence. He remembers the \nten plagues, preceding Gods rescue like motorcycle outriders at a \nroyal cavalcade. He focuses on stories where God took control of the \nnatural world to defeat a seemingly invincible enemy. Looking to \nhistory helps Habakkuk remember Gods compassion, power, impeccable \ncharacter, and timing. It is not just remembering personal \nexperiences of Gods blessing that helps. The more conversant we are \nwith our family history in the Old and New Testaments, the less \nhistorically myopic we become, and the better equipped to be \nanti-fragile in unpredictable times.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur third clue involves the present: Habakkuk responds in worship. \nSometimes life feels like a zero-sum game with winners and losers. \nHabakkuk definitely felt like he was on the losing team, and the \nBabylonians looked like they were on a winning streak (3:1617). If \nour love for God is dependent on being on the winning side at all \ntimes, we are destined to be disappointed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHabakkuk knew that true worship was about living in the ups and downs \nof the present, knowing that God is in control whichever way things \ngo. His final prayer models a type of worship which runs absolutely \ncounter to the consumer mentality that infects many of us. At one of \nthe darkest points in Israels history, disaster looming, Habakkuk \ncomposes a song of praise and unshakable faithwhatever surprises and \nshocks God may have in store (3:1819).\u0014\n\u0014\nHabakkuks prayer is a model of anti-fragilitya determined \nproclamation that his faith will remain robust and resilient, no \nmatter what.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the fig tree does not bud\u0014\nand there are no grapes on the vines,\u0014\nthough the olive crop fails\u0014\nand the fields produce no food,\u0014\nthough there are no sheep in the pen\u0014\nand no cattle in the stalls,\u0014\nyet I will rejoice in the Lord,\u0014\nI will be joyful in God my Savior.\u0014\nThe Sovereign Lord is my strength;\u0014\nhe makes my feet like the feet of a deer,\u0014\nhe enables me to tread on the heights. (Hab. 3:1719)\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we can pray like this, maybe well be able to respond to a \nconsistently unpredictable God with less shock and with more awe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nKrish Kandiah is founding director of Home for Good, an adoption and \nfoster care ministry, and a lecturer in theology at Regents Park \nCollege, Oxford University.

    "words": "Hazardous Vocation \u0014\n\u0014\nPreaching has always been a hazardous vocation, or calling. Even some \nof the greatest preachers, or perhaps we should say, especially the \ngreatest preachers, found their messages often earned them hostility, \nexile, even death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink of one of the greatest of them all -- Chrysostom, the \"golden \ntongue\" -- Bishop at Constantinople, exiled at least twice and sent \nout into the desert to die by the political authorities. Or think of \nJohn Bunyan. We remember him mostly as the author of The Pilgrim's \nProgress, second only to the Bible in circulation. But in his own day \nhe was better known as a preacher than a writer, and his powerful \nPuritan preaching landed him in Bedford jail for almost twelve years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother of the greatest preachers, John Wesley, was not allowed to \npreach in some dioceses, not even in his own deceased pastor father's \nchurch (so he went outside in the church cemetery and preached from \nhis father's grave stone).\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola was not the first notable Christian to be turned upon by \nthe city of Florence. One hundred fifty years before Savonarola was \nborn, Dante, author of The Divine Comedy, one of the greatest \ncreations in Christian literature, or any literature ever, was \nbanished from the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Savonarola was not the last 'revivalist' who would be rejected by \nthe very populace to whom he had brought powerful spiritual renewal. \nJonathan Edwards, a central figure in the \"Great Awakening\" in the \nAmerican colonies in the 1730s, was kicked out of his Northhampton, \nMassachusetts pastorate after having faithfully served there for 22 \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can only wonder how these kinds of preachers would fare today. \nFrankly, I find it difficult to imagine them being much impressed by \nthe growing tendency today to import market research methodologies \ninto church life. They were far more tuned to the Master than the \nmarket--even though far more risky.\u0014",

As doctrinally dangerous as this language may \nseem, it is biblical. Bring about your salvation. Produce your \nsalvation. Effect your salvation by continuous, sustained, \nstrenuous, effort. I say dangerous because Paul also teaches that \nsalvation is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one \nmay boast (Eph. 2:9). But there is no contradiction here, because \nthe works that can't save are the works that try to produce a saving \nrelationship with God. That is hopeless (Rom. 3:20). The works that \neffect our salvation are works that God himself brings about \nbecause there already is a saving relationship. That's what Paul goes \non to show.\u0014\n\u0014\n2) The salvation that Paul tells us to work out is not only the \ngreat reality of total deliverance from condemnation and hell; it is \nalso the more narrow, specific reality of daily deliverance from the \nsoul-destroying works of the flesh (1 Pet. 2:11)things like anger \nand self-pity and greed and lust. Work out your salvationyour \ndeliverancefrom those deadly enemies. In other words, we are to use \nour mind and our will to actively oppose these sins as we see them \nrising in our hearts. And this active opposition, Paul says, is \nreally our acting. But what we see next is that we are acting a \nmiracle, because God is performing this willing in us. For it is God \nwho works in you, to will.\u0014\n\u0014\n3) Besides telling us to workthat is, to make effort and actively \nbring about our deliverance from the looming sinPaul also says we \nshould do this with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in \nyou, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. Why should \nthere be fear and trembling as I attack my sin and bring about \nsalvation from anger or self-pity? The reason given for our \ntrembling is not a threat. It's a gift.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul says to fight your sin with fear and trembling, because God \nAlmighty, maker of heaven and earth, redeemer, justifier, sustainer, \nFather, lover is so close to you that your working and willing are \nhis working and willing. Tremble at this breathtaking thought! God \nAlmighty is in you. God is the one in you willing. God is the one in \nyou working. Your continuous, sustained, strenuous effort is not \nonly being carried out in the presence of God, but is the very work \nof God himself. God is at work in you. And what he is working is your \nworking. Therefore, we are not waiting for a miracle. We are acting a \nmiracle.\u0014\n\u0014\nRead the Bible, Act the Miracle\u0014\nThis is how we are supposed to read the Bible. We will and work \nbecause God is willing and working in us. We work with all our \nnatural powers to see the meaning of the inspired writings, because \nGod is at work in us to open our minds to see the glory that is \nreally there. Here is the way the writer of Proverbs puts it (note \nall the human activity in italics and God's provision in bold):\u0014\n\u0014\nMy son, if you receive my words\u0014\nand treasure up my commandments with you,\u0014\nmaking your ear attentive to wisdom\u0014\nand inclining your heart to understanding;\u0014\nyes, if you call out for insight\u0014\nand raise your voice for understanding,\u0014\nif you seek it like silver\u0014\nand search for it as for hidden treasures,\u0014\nthen you will understand the fear of the Lord\u0014\nand find the knowledge of God.\u0014\nFor the Lord gives wisdom;\u0014\nfrom his mouth come knowledge and understanding;\u0014\nhe stores up sound wisdom for the upright. (Prov. 2:17)\u0014\n\u0014\nVerses 14 exhort us to use all our powers to gain wisdom and \ninsight to see into the mind of God, receive God's words, treasure \nup his commandments, listen to wisdom, call out for insight, raise \nour voice for it, seek it like silver, search for it like treasure. \nThis is the writer's way of saying, Bend every effort. Exert all your \nenergy. Focus all your desires. Use all your powers. To what end? \nGod's wisdom!\u0014\n\u0014\nThen comes the surprising ground for all this effort. For the Lord \ngives wisdom. He gives it. We seek it with all our might. God gives \nit. Our labor is essential. But God's giving is decisive. If God does \nnot give, we do not find. We work out our deliverance from \nblindness to God's wisdomreading carefully with all our might. For \nGod is at work in us to will and to work the discovery of his \nlight. He creates the miracle of giving spiritual sight. We act the \nmiracle of seeing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeek Light with All Your Strength, for God Gives Sight\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle Paul showed us over and over in his writing that he \nexpected his readers, or listeners, to use their full powers of \nmental focus and thinking in order to see the light of the gospel of \nthe glory of Christ. For example, at least ten times in the book of \nActs, we see Paul's strategy to reason with people in his effort to \nshow people the truth and beauty of Christ (Acts 17:2, 4, 17; 18:4, \n19; 19:8, 9; 20:7, 9; 24:25). This was the oral version of the book \nof Romans. His assumption is that his listeners and readers would use \ntheir minds as fully in listening and reading as he did in speaking \nand writing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo he told the Corinthians, Do not be children in your thinking. Be \ninfants in evil, but in your thinking be mature (1 Cor. 14:20). Even \nmore forcefully he said that he would rather speak five \nunderstandable words with his mind to instruct others than ten \nthousand unintelligible words with the miracle of tongues (1 Cor. \n14:19). And Paul expected all of that thinking to reach its maximum \nfervor and focus in the act of reading his inspired letters. When \nyou read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of \nChrist (Eph. 3:4). In other words, engaging the mind in the mental \ntask of reading is God's appointed pathway into the glories of God. \nWe do the thinkingthe rigorous effort to read with understanding; \nGod creates the miracle of supernatural light in processes of our \nthought.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink Over Revelation, for God Gives Illumination\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle Paul makes the point most clearly and forcefully with \nthese simple words: Think over what I say, for the Lord will give \nyou understanding in everything (2 Tim. 2:7). We think. God gives. \nBoth-and. Not either-or. So many people swerve off the road to one \nside of this verse or the other. Some stress the first part: Think \nover what I say. They emphasize the indispensable role of reason and \nthinking and then minimize the supernatural role of God in making the \nmind able to see and embrace the glory of truth. Others stress the \nsecond half of the verse: for the Lord will give you understanding \nin everything. They emphasize the futility of reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Paul will not be divided that way. For Paul it was not either- \nor, but both-and. Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you \nunderstanding in everything. Notice the little word for. It means \nthat the will of God to give us understanding is the ground of our \nthinking, not the substitute for it. Paul does not say, God gives \nyou understanding, so don't waste your time thinking over what I \nsay. He does not encourage us to substitute prayer for thinking, but \nto saturate thinking with prayer. Nor does he say, Think hard over \nwhat I say because it all depends on you, and God does not illumine \nthe mind. No. He emphatically makes God's gift of illumination the \nground of our deliberation. He makes God's giving light the reason \nfor our pursuing light. Think over what I say, for the Lord will \ngive you understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading in Another's Power\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point of this chapter is that the supernatural reading of the \nBible does not minimize the urgency or effort of using all our \nnatural powers in that process. Or, to put it positively, the Bible \nitself encourages the fullest use of our body and our will and our \nreason in the supernatural act of reading the Scriptures. Reading the \nBible, in reliance on God, is one particular act among thousands of \nacts that, in the Christian life, are supernatural in this way. Our \nlife is to be lived in the Spirit and by the Spirit (Rom. 8:9; 1 \nCor. 12:3; Gal. 5:16, 18, 25; Eph. 6:18; Phil. 3:3; 2 Thess. 2:13). \nThat is true, whether we are roasting a turkey, running for office, \nor reading the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod does not intend to replace us when we are united to Christ; he \nintends to renew us and empower us and guide us. He intends for us to \nbe able to say, I worked hard, and also to say, Nevertheless, it \nwas not I but the grace of God with me (see 1 Cor. 15:10). He means \nfor us to say, I exerted my will and my mind and my body with all my \nmight, and also to say, Because God was willing and working in me \n(see Phil. 2:1213). He means for us to use our mind to discern what \nis pleasing to the Lord (Eph. 5:10) and also to joyfully confess \nthat God is working in us that which is pleasing in his sight (Heb. \n13:21).\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will have more to say about how the natural act of reading and the \nsupernatural gift of light in reading intersect. But for now, the \nall-important point is: the God-appointed aim of reading the Bible \nwill not happen without a supernatural intervention. And the normal \nway God intervenes is through the natural act of reading \nsupernaturally. God forbid that believing in the God-given \nsupernatural would make us despise the God-created natural.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question, then, that presses on us now is, How do we read the \nBible, if the great effects of seeing and savoring and being \ntransformed through reading are decisively in the power of another, \nnot ourselves?\u0014\n\u0014\nContent taken from Reading the Bible Supernaturally: Seeing and \nSavoring the Glory of God in Scriptureby John Piper, 2017\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Piper (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher \nof \\desiringGod.org and the chancellor of Bethlehem College & \nSeminary.

    "words": "How Anne Frank's Diary Survived\u0014\n\u0014\nUpdated: Jun 14, 2017 9:34 AM ET | Originally published: Jun 12, 2017\u0014\nIt was 75 years ago  on June 12, 1942  that Anne Frank received a \ndiary for her 13th birthday. Within a few years, she would have died \nin a concentration camp, but her diary survived. The following is an \nexcerpt from LIFE's new special edition, Anne Frank: The Diary at 70\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the years of the Holocaust, the Nazis systematically murdered \nsix million Jews, as well as five million Roma, Sinti, priests, nuns, \npeople with disabilities, homosexuals, and political prisoners. The \nkilling took place throughout Europe in more than 40,000 \nconcentration, labor, prisoner of war, and internment camps, as well \nas by the Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, which machine-gunned \nentire communities or shoved residents into gas-asphyxiation vans.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome 80 percent of Dutch Jews died in the Holocaust, giving Holland \nthe highest death rate in western Europe. Of the 107,000 Dutch Jews \nsent to the camps, only 5,000 lived. The death toll at Auschwitz, \nwhere more than a million people died, proved especially high. Of the \n60,000 Dutch Jews shipped to Auschwitz, just 673 survived, including \n127 men and women who had been on the Frank family's transport there \nin September of 1944.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto Frank was one of them, having been spared because he had been \nplaced in the sick barracks before the Russian army liberated the \ncamp on January 27, 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the nearly six foot tall Otto left Poland, he weighed less than \n115 pounds. He knew that Edith had died, but he was determined to \nmake his way back to Amsterdam. All my hope is the children, he \nwrote to his mother in Switzerland. I cling to the conviction that \nthey are alive and that we will be together again.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiep Gies and Bep Voskuijl had kept the firm going during the war. Jo \nKleiman, who was released from the Amerfoort concentration camp soon \nafter his arrest because of his health, made it back to the firm too. \nYet, as the war drew to an end and the Allies advanced, conditions \nthroughout the Netherlands continued to deteriorate. Distribution of \nfood and supplies was disrupted, and citizens chopped down trees and \ndismantled homes for fuel. Some resorted to eating tulip bulbs, and \nmore than 20,000 Netherlanders starved to death during what became \nknown as the Hunger Winter. All conversations centered on food, \nwrote Miep. Food obsessions were affecting all our minds. After \nCanadian troops liberated Amsterdam in May 1945, displaced residents \nstaggered home. Victor Kugler, who escaped from the Nazis during a \nforced march, returned to work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen on June 3, Otto Frank rang Miep and Jan Gies's doorbell.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiep would later recall how, after standing speechless for a time, \nOtto released the thunderbolt of news that Edith would not return \nbut that he held out hope for his daughters.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto moved in with the Gieses, went back to Opekta, and put ads in \npapers seeking information on Anne and Margot. Finally, in July, he \nheard that Jannie Brandes-Brilleslijper might know of their fate. On \nthe 18th of that month, he went to her home.\u0014\n\u0014\nI could hardly speak because it was very difficult to tell someone \nthat his children were not alive anymore, Jannie recalled. I said, \n'They are no more.' He turned deathly pale and slumped down into a \nchair.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Red Cross confirmed their deaths, and Miep knew that Anne \nwould not be coming back for the diary, she told Otto that she had \nkept it and 327 loose papers safe. Though he was at first too \noverwhelmed to read the testament his daughter had left of her short \nlife, eventually he girded himself to learn what Anne had written. \nWhat he found, he would recall, was so unbelievably exciting that \nhe could barely put it down.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only the diary but also the revisions that Anne had made as she \ndreamed of creating a novel and launching her career had miraculously \nsurvived. This brilliant young girl revised her diary because she \ndiscovered that she had become a much better writer, the novelist \nPhilip Roth, who conjured up Anne in his novels The Ghost Writer, \nExit Ghost, and My Life as a Man, has observed. The fact that she \nrewrote it is one sign that, had she survived, she would have \nachieved an important literary career.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto reunited with old friends. Eva Schloss and her mother, Elfriede, \nsurvived Auschwitz. One day Otto came by with a small parcel under \nhis arm and carefully took out Anne's diary. It was very emotional, \nSchloss tells LIFE. He read a few sentences but he always broke into \ntears.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had decided that it would be his mission to share Anne's words \nwith the world. Otto had the diary typed up, though he shifted a few \nentries and omitted sections that were critical of her mother and of \nFritz Pfeffer, as well as certain entries that included Anne's \nmusings on her emerging sexuality. It proved difficult to find a \npublisher until one of Otto's friends showed it to the historian Jan \nRomein, who wrote a front-page article with the headline Kinderstem \n(A Child's Voice) for the April 3, 1946, edition of the newspaper \nHet Parool. To me, however, this apparently inconsequential diary by \na child, Romein wrote, stammered out in a child's voice, embodies \nall the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at \nNuremberg put together. Soon after, the Amsterdam publisher Contact \nagreed to publish the book, and on June 25, 1947, it appeared as Het \nAchterhuis (The Secret Annex). Otto gave copies to family, friends, \nthe Dutch prime minister, and the royal family. (Miep Gies could not \nbring herself to read it until the second edition appeared.)\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly two years had passed since the end of the war, but for many the \nbook by the 15-year-old who had written that she still believed that \npeople are truly good at heart already proved useful as a way to \npersonalize the Holocaust. Not only do you have a name and a face \nand a person in the case of Anne Frank, but you have a very well \nwritten diary. It is captivating, Professor Deborah Lipstadt, author \nof Denying the Holocaust, tells LIFE. She is a good writer and she \nknows how to express herself. She is expressing herself in something \nshe doesn't even know will see the light of day.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW JESUS DISCIPLED WOMEN",
    "words": "How \nJesus Discipled Women \u0014\nIn a patriarchal culture, Jesus showed his followers a radically \ndifferent way to relate and lead.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlice Mathews\u0014\n\u0014\nGod entered the human race as a human being to begin a great \nreversal. He died to pay our penalty for our sins, but he also lived \nand walked the paths of Galilee and Judea to overturn the kinds of \nhierarchies that destroy lives and hinder God's purposes. He was \nclear that many who are first will be last, and many who are last \nwill be first (Matt. 19:30). Again and again throughout the Gospels, \nwe hear him denounce human assumptions about power and dominance. He \nwas consistently clear: Leadership is from the bottom, not from the \ntop. We lead as we serve.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the hierarchies Jesus overturned was the gender-based hierarchy \ndominating life in Israel. He showed his followers a radically \ndifferent way of relating to women.\u0014\n\u0014\nCapable students, faithful witnesses\u0014\n\u0014\nWatch Jesus, for example, in John 4 as he deliberately planned his \njourney in order to encounter a despised woman in Samaria. He shocked \nthe woman at the town well by speaking to her and then by actually \ndrinking water from her cup. When his followers returned from town \nwith some food, they were astonished that he would talk to such a \nperson (v. 27). But even though the woman was an outcast in her town, \nher testimony to town leaders was so powerful that they also came out \nto meet Jesus. Ultimately, at their invitation, Jesus stayed for two \nmore days to teach the people, many of whom became his followers. \nJesus empowered a despised woman to become a vehicle for evangelizing \nthat community.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr think of the shock to his followers when Jesus not only allowed \nMary of Bethany to sit at his feet and learn (in the posture typical \nof rabbinic students), but even encouraged her to do so (Luke \n10:3842). Rabbi Eliezer had declared, If any man gives his daughter \na knowledge of the Law, it is as though he taught her lechery (m. \nSotah 3:4). Jose ben Johanan of Jerusalem had taught, He who talks \nmuch with womankind brings evil upon himself and neglects the study \nof the Law and at the last will inherit Gehenna (m. Avot 1:5). In \nthe eyes of many Jews, not only was teaching theology to a woman not \nnecessary; it was downright wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn New Testament Judaism as practiced by the teachers of the law and \nthe Pharisees, women were held responsible for the evil in the world. \nFor that reason, they were strictly segregated from the social and \nreligious life of their communities. Religious men considered them \ninferior and unteachable. But Jesus overturned that false hierarchy.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus had come to fulfill the law, not to annul it. In Deuteronomy \n31:12, the law stated, Assemble the peoplemen, women and children, \nand the foreigners residing in your townsso they can listen and \nlearn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of \nthis law. Women, children, and even foreigners had a right, even an \nobligation, to listen to and obey God's law. Any hierarchy impeding \nthis right was against God's purposes. When Jesus encouraged Mary of \nBethany to take the role of a disciple, he revealed a lot about his \nview of women: They are intelligent persons who can understand his \nteachings as well as men can.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Luke 10, Mary's sister, Martha, was in the kitchen preparing food, \nin contrast to Mary, who was sitting at Jesus' feet. In John 11, \nhowever, we encounter Jesus talking with Martha when her brother had \ndied. We watch Martha rise to the highest level of faith in all of \nJohn's gospel when she said, I believe that you are the Messiah, the \nSon of God, who is to come into the world (v. 27). In this one \nstatement, it's clear she understood three fundamental things about \nJesus: (1) he was Lord; (2) he was the Christ (Messiah); and (3) \nhe was divine (the Son of God), with a divine purpose in the world. \nJohn stated that the entire Gospel had been written so others may \nbelieve that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by \nbelieving you may have life in his name (20:31). It is the woman \nMartha who saw most clearly Jesus' purpose and ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nRedeemed and welcome\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more shocking in his day was Jesus' willingness to redeem \nprostitutes. Luke narrates a dinner party held by Simon the Pharisee. \nWhile they were at the table eating, a woman of the streets came to \nSimon's house, found where Jesus reclined at the dinner table, came \nup behind him, and began to pour perfume on his feet (Luke 7:3738). \nOf course, Simon was shocked that Jesus would allow such unseemly \nbehavior! In the ensuing conversation, Jesus told one of his little \nstory gems about two debtors and their attitudes toward the \nmoneylender when the debts were forgiven. From that, Jesus drew a \nparallel between the woman's and Simon's treatment of him as guest in \nthe house. Then turning to the woman, he said, Your sins are \nforgiven . . . Your faith has saved you; go in peace (vv. 48, 50). \nThe Pharisees watching the prostitute anoint Jesus saw only a fallen, \nunredeemable woman; Jesus saw only a repentant sinner whose sins he \nforgave.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another conversation with the chief priests and elders in the \nJerusalem temple, Jesus shocked them by saying, The tax collectors \nand the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For \nJohn came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did \nnot believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And \neven after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him (Matt. \n21:3132). Jesus overturned their notions of who could or could not \nenter God's kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nMessenger of the Resurrection\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the women mentioned in the Gospels, Mary Magdalene is \nmentioned most often (14 times). From Luke 8:13, we know that Jesus \ndelivered her from the power of seven demons and that she was part of \nthe group of women who traveled with Jesus and the disciples \nitinerantly all over Galilee and back and forth to Jerusalem in the \nsouthern part of Palestine for the national feasts. We also know she \nwas at the cross during Jesus' execution; she was present when Joseph \nof Arimathea and Nicodemus hastily placed Jesus' body in the tomb; \nand she was one of the first at the tomb to anoint Jesus' body when \nthe Sabbath ended. We also know she was the first to be commissioned \nby Jesus as a messenger of his resurrection: Go instead to my \nbrothers and tell them  (John 20:17). This function of witness to \nthe resurrection later became a favorite way to designate the \napostles (Acts 1:22; 2:32). It was the reward for a loyal female \ndisciple that Jesus entrusted her with the most powerful message: Go \nand tell my disciples that I'm no longer dead. It's not surprising \nthat the church fathers called her the apostle to the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nJewish rabbinic law held that the testimony of 100 women is not equal \nto that of one man. Yet women were the ones who consistently stayed \nwith Christ through his agony and death on the cross and later were \nfirst at the empty tomb. If a woman's testimony was to be discounted, \nwhy did Jesus choose to appear first to a woman after his \nresurrection and send her as his messenger to the male disciples?\u0014\n\u0014\nParadigms of discipleship\u0014\n\u0014\nCompared to other literary works from the first century, the Gospels \nhave a relatively high number of references to women. What is even \nmore remarkable is that in Jesus' actions, there is not a single case \nin which a woman is put down, reproached, humiliated, or cast into \none of the lewd stereotypes of that day.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike other men, Jesus spoke freely to women in public. He taught \ntheology to women. He had women as disciples or followers. He was \nclear that women would be active participants in the work of his \nkingdom. As we watch Jesus move through the Gospels, we see him take \na firmly countercultural stand on many issues because his mission was \nto oppose all that violated the will of God. Again and again, we see \nhim base his definition of persons and his directives for male/female \nrelationships in God's creational purposes in Genesis 1 and 2.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we look at these and other women in the Gospels, we note that they \nare presented positively. No woman is shown resisting his initiative, \nfailing to believe, deserting him, or betraying him. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the way John presented men in his gospel. Among even the \nTwelve there were evidences of hypocrisy (John 12:45), vanity \n(13:37), fickleness (13:38; 16:3132), obtuseness (3:10; 16:18), \ndeliberate unbelief (9:2425), and thorough evil (13:2, 2730).\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of their faith, their understanding, and their fidelity, \nwomen were often paradigms of discipleship for the men who lacked \nthese qualities. In contrast to first-century religious leaders, \nJesus affirmed women as whole persons with both the privilege and \nresponsibility to follow him. Jesus came to proclaim good news to \nthe poor  to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of \nsight for the blind, to set the oppressed free (Luke 4:18). That \nincluded women and the gender-based hierarchies dominating their \nlives. Jesus' actions and teachings delivered a strong counterpunch \nto the patriarchal ideas rampant in that culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlice Mathews (PhD, Iliff School of Theology/University of Denver) is \nthe Lois W.

They're \nsweating and crying. One lady, who is a school teacher from Santa \nBarbara, said the first time she came to see Zenyatta she was in a \nwheel chair; she couldn't walk. She said Zenyatta inspired her to \npush herself and try to walk.

My dad passed away; \nmy husband had three strokes; three of my dogs died; I had to put my \nmom, who has third-stage Alzheimers, in a nursing home; and we went \nbankrupt due to my husband's inability to work.

    "words": "\u0014\nMinistry is a sacrificial act that requires risk, reconciliation and \nintuition. It is a craft that pastors shape over time, a vocation \nforged in the throes of experience and ever-evolving knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo goes the prayer in \"God of Grace and God of Glory\" in which the \nauthor, Harry Emerson Fosdick, implores the Lord, \"Grant us wisdom, \ngrant us courage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPenned soon after World War I, \"God of Grace and God of Glory\" was \nFosdick's confession of having supported the \"war to end all wars,\" \nonly to realize that violence only begot more violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike other progressives of his time, Fosdick, pastor of the historic \nRiverside Church in Manhattan, repented of his ideals and wrote this \nhymn in which he asked God to \"cure thy children's warring madness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFosdick's beloved hymn captures the spirit of historic progressivism \nin its lofty lilt, set to the music of John Hughes, while birthing \nnotions of nonviolence that shaped much of the progressive church \ninto recent days.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, after Fosdick, Riverside Church became a beacon for peace \nand nonviolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the church's pastors, William Sloane Coffin (kin to Fosdick), \ngained notoriety for preaching against the Vietnam War and nuclear \nproliferation in the 1970s in Riverside's pulpit.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is this legacy that spurned controversy over Fosdick's hymn in the \nfirst place. If you look at hymnals from the Vietnam War era onward, \nnotably hymns published in the 1970s, such as the 1975 \"Baptist \nHymnal,\" many editors removed the third verse, which asks God to undo \na nation's penchant for war.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven moderate-leaning hymnals of late, including the \"Celebrating \nGrace\" hymnal published in Macon, Georgia, in 2010 excludes the verse \nin favor of asking God to \"set our feet on lofty places.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis contemporary spin is more a hymn for hikers than it is one that \nshapes theological engagement of peacekeepers for the 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have grown to love the historic version of \"God of Grace and God of \nGlory\" for both its musical artistry and its message ever since my \nearliest years in seminary. It was then that I studied Fosdick and \nhis historic tenure at Riverside.\u0014\n\u0014\nI learned how he moved his church into the \"Christian century,\" \nbattled the shortfalls of religious fundamentalism and gave rise to a \nnew style of homiletics that inspired preachers to use sermons as \n\"pastoral care on a group scale.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI got a hold of Fosdick's memoir, \"For the Living of These Days,\" and \nread about his own struggles in ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all his boldness in the public square - he had his own radio show \nand all - he had a fairly weak constitution that led to multiple \nnervous breakdowns.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe did not just preach God's Word, he wrestled with God's Word. His \nmovement from warmonger to nonviolent activist evolved out of one \nsuch struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever I face difficult times in ministry, I often find myself \npraying Fosdick's words.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is comforting that hundreds of thousands of Christians have sung \nthis song, and it is in the company of saints that I still sing (or \npray) to ask God to grant me wisdom and courage for the facing of \ndifficult hours. It is a prayer for the soul as well as the church, \nwhich is the womb of Christ's budding story.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a world that debates left versus right, liberal versus \nconservative, one political party versus another, Fosdick, his legacy \nand his hymn remind me that all our Christian leanings, wielded over \n100 years, have all contributed greatly to a magnificent church, a \nrich tapestry of worship and an artistic depth to hymnody and liturgy \nthat still wrestles with text and Scripture even today. For, at the \nend of the day, God is still one who is both grace-filled and \nglorious.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe LaGuardia is senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Vero Beach, \nFlorida.

Many churches\u0014\n         and denominations put a lot of effort\u0014\n         into attracting new members only to\u0014\n         lose many of them through a back door \u0014\n         a term used to describe people who regularly\u0014\n         attended a church in the past but stopped.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Churches have gone to great extreme\u0014\n         effort to get people in the front door of the\u0014\n         church, Brad Waggoner of LifeWay Christian\u0014\n         Resources said in a 2006 podcast. There's\u0014\n         been some success numerically in that strategy;\u0014\n         but very few people are talking about the back\u0014\n         door of the church ... The back door is just as\u0014\n         important as the front door in determining the\u0014\n         health of a local church.\u0014\n\u0014\n            LifeWay President Thorn Rainer, in an arti-\u0014\n         cle on ChurchLeaders.com, described a meeting\u0014\n         with more than 200 church leaders where nearly\u0014\n         90 percent indicated their churches had a prob-\u0014\n         lem with closing the back door.\u0014\n\u0014\n            For years, the primary focus in many\u0014\n         churches has been on the 'front door' \u0014\n         people coming into the church, Rainer said.\u0014\n         While such an emphasis remains the Great\u0014\n         Commission priority; our research shows that\u0014\n         churches and their leaders must not neglect\u0014\n         the issue of the back door, commonly called\u0014\n         assimilation.\u0014\n\u0014\n            George Bullard of The Columbia\u0014\n         Partnership, a Columbia, S.C.-based organiza-\u0014\n         tion that helps churches pursue and sustain\u0014\n         vital ministry; said churches face an assimila-\u0014\n         tion challenge in the first year after new\u0014\n         people begin attending to influence whether\u0014\n         they become part of a community or slip\u0014\n         through the back door.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Church growth is a pretty simple con-\u0014\n         cept, Bullard said. You get more people who\u0014\n         have not been regular attendees and members\u0014\n         to become regular attendees and members. You\u0014\n         get more regular attendees and members to\u0014\n         deepen their involvement in their church and\u0014\n         its disciple-making activities. You get fewer reg-\u0014\n         ular attendees and members to become bored,\u0014\n         apathetic or offended and leave the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Four things need to happen within the\u0014\n         first year for people to assimilate into a new\u0014\n         church, Bullard said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Make attendance a habit\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n            First, he said, they must have established a\u0014\n         pattern of regular attendance. By today's stan-\u0014\n         dards, in a culture that no longer sits around\u0014\n         on Sundays, Bullard said, regular attendance is\u0014\n         between 39 and 42 Sundays a year.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Research indicates that American\u0014\n         churches, by and large, went through a period\u0014\n         of more than 10 years when they significantly\u0014\n         lowered their expectations of members and\u0014\n         attendees, Rainer said. The result was an\u0014\n         exodus of people from the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Why would I want to be a part of some-\u0014\n         thing that expects nothing of me? Rainer\u0014\n         quoted a former active church member saying\u0014\n         to the research team. Many churches now are\u0014\n         attempting to remedy the problem with new-\u0014\n         member classes, where expectations of service,\u0014\n         stewardship and attendance are clearly\u0014\n         established.\u0014\n\u0014\n         \u0014\n                               Get connected\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n         Second, Bullard said, they must have con-\u0014\n         nected with some kind of teaching/learning\u0014\n         experience such as a small group or Sunday\u0014\n         school class.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Churches that close the back door seek\u0014\n         to get as many of their members as possible\u0014\n         into small groups, Waggoner said. In some\u0014\n         churches, these groups meet in homes. In\u0014\n         other churches, the small group is a Sunday\u0014\n         school class that meets at the church. The key\u0014\n         issue, according to our research, is that the\u0014\n         small group is an open group, meaning it has\u0014\n         no predetermined termination date, and any-\u0014\n         one can enter the group at any point.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Develop deep relationships\u0014\n\u0014\n         Third, Bullard said, they need to have devel-\u0014\n         oped friends they call at 3 a.m., a reference\u0014\n         to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign\u0014\n         national-security ad featuring a ringing phone\u0014\n         in the White House at 3 a.m. and posing a\u0014\n         question to voters about who they want\u0014\n         answering the phone.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Win Am, a pioneer in church growth,\u0014\n         showed years ago that if somebody can make\u0014\n         five friends at a church, they are much less\u0014\n         likely to drop out, Waggoner noted. We need\u0014\n         to create opportunities for people to build\u0014\n         friendships and to get to know folks,\u0014\n\u0014\n            The more new members connect with\u0014\n         longer-term members, the greater the opportu-\u0014\n         nity for assimilation, Rainer said. One twist\u0014\n         the research found, he said, is that most such\u0014\n         relationships develop before the new member\u0014\n         ever comes to church. In other words, mem-\u0014\n         bers first developed relationships with people\u0014\n         outside the walls of the church and then\u0014\n         invited them after the relationship was\u0014\n         established.\u0014\n\u0014\n         \u0014\n                                         Go to work\u0014\n\u0014\n         Finally; Bullard said, they need to get some\u0014\n         kind of job, whether elected, appointed or as\u0014\n         an ongoing volunteer.\u0014\n\u0014\n            There's no doubt about it that when you\u0014\n         involve people in the ministries of the church,\u0014\n         they are much more likely to give and much\u0014\n         more likely to stay; Waggoner agreed. If\u0014\n         they're just pew sitters, they are more vulnera-\u0014\n         ble to become disillusioned, and we'll lose\u0014\n         some of the people\u0014\n\u0014\n            The earlier a new member or attendee\u0014\n         can get involved in a church's ministries, the\u0014\n         higher the likelihood of effective assimilation,\u0014\n         Waggoner said. Churches that close the back\u0014\n         door have a clear plan to get people involved\u0014\n         and doing ministry as quickly as possible.\u0014\n\u0014\n            While not a primary motivation for\u0014\n         assimilating new people, Bullard added, an\u0014\n         unintended consequence is that people who\u0014\n         buy into the church with their time give five\u0014\n         times more money than those who do not\u0014\n         invest their time and energy.\u0014",

    "title": "HORROR FOR 13 SIBLINGS HIDDEN IN \"PRIVATE HOME SCHOOL\"",
    "words": "Horror for 13 California Siblings Hidden by Veneer of a Private Home \nSchool\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LOUIS KEENE, \\JENNIFER MEDINA and PATRICIA MAZZEI      JAN. 16, \n2018 \u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nPERRIS, Calif.  The private school had a welcoming name. The \nprincipal was scientifically minded. But the Sandcastle Day School \nwas a nightmare for the six students enrolled there.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid A. Turpin created the school inside his nondescript stucco home \nsoutheast of Los Angeles. But the only ones enrolled there were the \nsix of his 13 children who were school age. And what took place \ninside was not teaching but torture, the authorities said, after they \nraided the house over the weekend and found a horrifying scene of \nemaciated children chained to furniture. The putrid smell overwhelmed \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy creating such a school of horrors, Mr. Turpin had kept the \nauthorities at bay. His children were never seen by teachers or \ncounselors. Their absences never raised suspicions. On Tuesday, state \nand local officials were on the defensive as they tried to explain \nhow such things could have occurred in a private school the state had \nsanctioned.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Turpin, 56, and his wife, Louise A. Turpin, 49, were arrested on \nnine counts of torture and child endangerment after one of their \ndaughters escaped from the home out a window before dawn and called \nthe police on a deactivated cellphone that only allowed her to dial \n911. The girl, 17, showed the police photos to corroborate her story. \nOnce the authorities entered the disheveled home, they found the \nTurpins' 12 other children, ages 2 to 29. They were so malnourished \nthat the older ones looked years younger.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can't begin to imagine the pain and suffering that they have \nendured, Mayor Michael Vargas of Perris said of the siblings. This \nis a very happy and tight, hard-working family community.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a video posted online, the couple warmly smiled and held hands as \nthey renewed their vows 26 years after their wedding. At the Elvis \nChapel in Las Vegas in 2011, Mr. Turpin offered his wife a ring \nbefore dancing to Fools Rush In. They did so again about five years \nlater, with their children looking on, the girls in plaid dresses and \nthe boys in matching bright ties.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore Sunday, there was no indication that any authority had ever \nset foot in the home. Riverside County's child protective services \nnever received reports of abuse. And the State Department of \nEducation said it had registered the school, but had never been \ninside.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case raises questions about whether the state may be too lenient \nin its approach to home schooling and whether it should have been \nmonitoring Mr. Turpin more closely. In California, almost anyone can \nopen a private school by filing an affidavit with the state. \nCalifornia is one of 14 states that ask parents only to register to \ncreate a home school, and in 11 other states, including Texas, \nparents are not required to submit any documentation at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe California Department of Education said it was sickened by the \ntragedy and was investigating what had occurred. The department \nregisters private schools, but does not approve, monitor, inspect, \nor oversee them, said Bill Ainsworth, a department spokesman.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My  Documents/ Horror for 13 California Siblings\u0014",

    "title": "HEROD THE GREAT",
    "words": "Herod the Great\u0014\n\u0014\nHerod the Greats extensive building activities included this \naqueduct at Caesarea Maritima that was part of an intricate water \nsystem built to bring water to the city from the distant \nmountains.The months following Antipaters death were filled with \nintrigue and revolt. Herod forcefully put down an insurrection in \nGalilee, winning Roman favor, an extension of his territory (adding \nSamaria and Coele-Syria), and the hatred of the Jews. Antigonus, one \nof the sons of Aristobulus, gained the support of the Parthians and \ntook control of Judea. Phasel was killed. Hyrcanus II was captured, \nand his ears were cut off, thereby preventing him from ever serving \nas high priest again (Lev 21:17-23). Antigonus was appointed high \npriest and king of Judea by the Parthians. Herod fled to Petra, then \nto Egypt, and finally to Rome, where he was appointed king of Judea \nin 40 b.c.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudea, however, was still controlled by Antigonus. With Roman support \nHerod invaded Judea, and by 37 b.c. he had captured Jerusalem and \nexecuted Antigonus. He also pursued the bandits who roamed Judea and \nGalilee and either exterminated them or drove them off.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerods rule is a story of tragic contrasts. He sought to win the \nfavor of the Jews, but he was hated because he was an Idumean, an \nagent of Rome, and a replacement for the Hasmoneans. In response \nHerod married Mariamne, the granddaughter of Hyrcanus II. He \nappointed another Aristobulus, grandson of Hyrcanus II, as high \npriest, but Aristobulus III drowned shortly thereafter. Herod was \nblamed, but he was ruthless in defense of his power. By the time of \nhis own death, he had ordered the deaths of everyone suspected of \nintrigue against him. This included Joseph, his uncle, \nbrother-in-law, and trusted aide; Hyrcanus II; Mariamne, whose death \ngrieved him terribly; two of his sons by Mariamne; and Antipater, his \neldest son. Along with these family members, other descendants of the \nHasmoneans, suspected leaders of the army, and zealous Jewish leaders \nwere executed. The Gospel of Matthews stories about Herods efforts \nto kill the Christ child, though unsupported by nonbiblical sources, \nare entirely consistent with what we know of Herods response to \nthreats against his throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerod was a great builder. He built fortresses throughout his \nterritory: the Herodium, Masada, and Machaerus. He built the port at \nCaesarea, with its aqueduct to bring water from Mount Carmel, and \nrebuilt Samaria (Sebaste). He built palaces in Jerusalem and in \nJericho. Most important, he built a grand, new temple in Jerusalem. \nThe temple was begun in 20-19 b.c. but completed only in a.d. 64, \nshortly before its destruction in a.d. 70. The Jewish leaders had so \nlittle trust for Herod that they would only let him tear down the old \ntemple in stages as it became necessary to clear space for the next \nsection of the new temple. Neither did they call it the Herodian \ntemple; the entire period is known as \"Second Temple Judaism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHerod died in 4 b.c. Before he died he made his sister, Salome, \npromise to execute a number of Jewish leaders at his death so that \nthere would be mourning throughout the country. She did not carry out \nthis order. Nevertheless, Herods son Archelaus violently quelled the \nriots in Judea, and some three thousand died.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHolman Bible Handbook.\u0014",

    "title": "HILLBILLY ELEGY, A COMMENTARY",
    "words": "J.D. Vances, HILLBILLY ELEGY: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in \nCrisis. It is a fascinating book, a well-written story that is hard \nto put down.\u0014\n\u0014\nVance grew up in a culture of family violence, of poverty, of \nclose-mindedness, without models of achievement. Yet he achieved, \nthrough the Marines and an Ohio State U and Yale Law School.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough separated by fifty years or so in age, JD Vance and I grew \nup in a very similar culture, the hillbilly culture, because that \nculture never changes through the years. Nonetheless, Vance became a \nhillbilly conservative and I became a hillbilly liberal. [1]\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was one major difference in our formative lives: our families. \nMine was no picnic, and in later life my father told me I wasnt \nactually his child [2]. Compared to Vances family, however, mine was \nOzzie & Harriet.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. Ds family was a mess. His father walked out. His mother was a \nnarcissistic alcoholic and drug addict who brought man after man into \ntheir ever-shifting houses, some trying to be a father to JD and his \nsister, some just to be there for a while. None lasted long. They \nwere always on the edge of poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is said that a child can survive a tumultuous childhood if there \nis one dependable adult in its life. JD had that, his mamaw, Bonnie \nVance, a gun-wielding foul-mouthed nasty woman who scorned everyone \nand everything, except her grandson.\u0014\n\u0014\nVance and I even share some common ground, SW Ohio. My family had \nroots in both SW Indiana and SW Ohio, starting in the late 19th \ncentury in Cedarville and Dayton and extending later down to Oxford \nand Hamilton. During the industrial expansion after WWII, the \ncompanies there, in places like Middletown, where Vance grew up off \nand on, recruited workers from Kentucky. They were smart enough to \nrecruit whole families, thus creating a more stable work force.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir culture, however, remained hillbilly. It was linked inexorably \nto home, the hill county of the Hatfields and McCoys in Kentucky. \nEvery weekend there were long lines of cars going to and from home. \nWhen you asked them where they were from, they named their county in \nKentucky. The SW OH industrial area was never home, but just where \nthey resided and worked.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is basically what Vance says about hillbillies, and I think hes \nright. Hillbillies are tribalistic. They are pugnacious. They value \ntoughnessthey fight hard and drink hard. They also work hard if its \nsomething theyve chosen to do, but if theyre working for someone \nelse, the main point is to get paid without working. They are \npatriotic, in a tribalistic nationalistic sense. They are identified \nnot by what they trust but by what they distrust. They distrust \noutsiders. They distrust the Law. They distrust education and \neducated people. They assume they are stuck in poverty. They deplore \ngovernment welfare but depend upon it. They are gullible. They think \nthey are smarter than educated people, pointy headed intellectuals, \nas my father called them. They live by a misogynistic honor code, \nin which a man is allowed to abuse his women freely but is \nhonor-found to avenge them if some other man mistreats them.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce again, a major difference between his hillbilly culture and \nmine. My extended family and the people around me were patriotic and \nproud of military service but deplored stupid violence, especially in \nthe family. They honored education and achievement. Their honor code \nwas an honest days work for an honest days pay. You were to \nrespect others, even if you disagreed with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nVance does not say, I made it on my own. He is much too smart for \nthat. He knows it he made it with a lot of help. He deplores the \nclose-mindedness of his own people who believe things like Barak \nObama was born in Kenya and is not a Christian.

There are no models of good \nmarriages.

    "words": "How Churches Must Move Forward on LGBTQ Debate \u0014\nSteven Schafer\u0014\nTuesday, April 24, 2018 \u0014\n\u0014\nJudging by the varied responses to the Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship's Illumination Project, it is clear that angst and \nfrustration exists on both sides of the debate, Schafer writes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate taking place within churches across denominational lines \nregarding the inclusion of LGBTQ individuals and their relationships \nis more than familiar by now.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one side, there are traditionalists arguing in favor of \nmaintaining the church's position of recognizing marriage and \ncelibacy as the only licit options for Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other side, there are revisionists calling for the expansion \nof the church's traditional sexual ethic to include LGBTQ people.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudging by the varied responses to the Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship's Illumination Project, it is clear that angst and \nfrustration exists on both sides of the debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nDepending on one's perspective, the report either went too far or did \nnot go far enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his February 2018 EthicsDaily.com column, Colin Harris wisely \nsuggests that the committee's report be viewed as a \"guide for \nongoing conversation.\" A transition rather than a period at the end \nof sentence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are to continue along this path, perhaps it would be fruitful \nto step back and examine the trajectory of the conversation to this \npoint as well as the terms in which it is taking place.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevisionists call for the welcome and inclusion of LGBTQ individuals \nand their relationships, assuming those relationships are \ncharacterized by fidelity and lifelong commitment. Consider one way \nthis argument plays out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, revisionists appeal to the doctrine of the Trinity. They argue \nthat the Triune God is a divine, unified community of beings that \ndisplays relationality, mutuality and the sharing of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nHumans, created in the image of God, are called to reflect these \nqualities by sharing mutual love with others.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, revisionists argue that humans express love through \nsexuality. It is through sexuality that God invites humans into \nrelationship with others in order that love might be shared.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom this perspective, requiring LGBTQ individuals to remain celibate \nrepresents a barrier to the expression of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, revisionists appeal to Jesus, who is described as the one who \nbroke down barriers to inclusion and sought to bring the marginalized \ninto the fold.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the church is to follow Jesus' example, revisionists argue, she \nshould welcome and affirm LGBTQ people and their relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, revisionists choose to read Scripture through the lens of \nGod's ever-widening inclusion and acceptance.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, God's covenant began with the family of Abram and was \neventually extended to the Gentiles. In similar fashion, the church \nshould reflect God's expanding love by affirming LGBTQ people.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on these arguments, revisionists assert that the debate over \nthe inclusion of LGBTQ people is primarily about love's expression \nand welcoming the outcast.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy contrast, traditionalists argue in favor of maintaining the \nchurch's historic position by defining marriage as a lifelong, \nmonogamous relationship between a man and a woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, traditionalists argue that God set the parameters for marriage \nwith the creation of the first couple in Genesis. Marriage requires \nsexual differentiation and monogamy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, relying primarily on the creation stories from Genesis and \nthe books of the law, the traditionalists argue that heterosexual, \nmonogamous marriage is the only place that the Old Testament \nconsiders acceptable for sexual expression.\u0014\n\u0014\nSexual acts that fall outside this parameter are sinful in a way \nparallel to other sexual sins mentioned in the Old Testament, such as \nheterosexual promiscuity or pedophilia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, traditionalists assert that the definition of marriage found \nin creation is affirmed in the New Testament, where it becomes a \nmetaphor for Christ's relationship with the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, traditionalists assert that the biblical witness \nconsistently denounces sexual relationships that do transgress the \nbounds of marriage. The inclusion of LGBTQ people amounts to \nrejecting the plain meaning of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, for traditionalists, the debate over the affirmation of LGBTQ \npeople and their relationships is concerned with the authority of \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is striking is not what is included in these two positions, but \nwhat is missing in the discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the revisionist account struggles to make sense of two \nkey parts of the creation stories: sexual difference and procreation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA theological explanation of sexuality must account for the \ndescription of humans created in the image of God as male and female \n(Genesis 1:26-27).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe traditionalists also have their shortcomings. Their account \nrelies heavily on a doctrine of creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheologically speaking, creation is not an independent category; it \nis connected to the fall, redemption and eschatology in the grand \nnarrative of God's action in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nA theological account of sexuality must be able to explain how the \ncoming of Christ alters the church's understanding of sex and \nmarriage; in other words, why Christians are not required to marry \nand have children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it stands, the debate presents two mutually exclusive options.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the traditionalist perspective, it is a choice between \nsubmitting to or rejecting the authority of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the viewpoint of the revisionists, the choice is between \nwelcoming a more just, loving future for the outcast or retreating to \nthe traditional, archaic position of the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is clear that the debate cannot be solved while couched in these \nterms.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis discussion is not primarily about the authority of Scripture: \nthose who believe the Bible versus those who do not. This is a \ndisagreement taking place between Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's also not a question of either clinging to a tired, obsolete past \nor leaving the dark ages of tradition, institution or anything else \nthat slows the wheels of \"progress\" as we march into the light of a \nmore just and equitable future. Christians are those who have \ninherited an \"old, old story.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the conversation is to continue, the more pressing questions \nconcern the ways in which Scripture is deployed to discuss issues \npivotal to sexuality and marriage as well as how our understanding of \nsex and marriage has been altered by the passing of time.\u0014\n\u0002Steven Schafer is a freelance writer who recently received his \ndoctorate in theological ethics from the University of Aberdeen in \nScotland.\u0014",

    "words": ".                                               How Did Lucifer Fall \nand Become Satan?**\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nRon Rhodes\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Lucifer's fall is described in two key Old Testament \nchapters\\Ezekiel 28 and \\Isaiah 14. Let's briefly look at both of \nthese.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would seem from the context of Ezekiel 28 that the first ten \nverses of this chapter are dealing with a human leader. Then, \nstarting in verse 11 and on through verse 19, Lucifer is the focus of \ndiscussion. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the rationale for the conclusion that these latter verses \nrefer to the fall of Lucifer? Whereas the first ten verses in this \nchapter speak about the ruler of Tyre (who was condemned for claiming \nto be a god though he was just a man), the discussion moves to the \nking of Tyre starting in verse 11. Many scholars believe that though \nthere was a human ruler of Tyre, the real king of Tyre was Satan, \nfor it was he who was ultimately at work in this anti-God city and it \nwas he who worked through the human ruler of the city. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome have suggested that these verses may actually be dealing with a \nhuman king of Tyre who was empowered by Satan. Perhaps the historic \nking of Tyre was a tool of Satan, possibly even indwelt by him. In \ndescribing this king, Ezekiel also gives us glimpses of the \nsuperhuman creature, Satan, who was using, if not indwelling, him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, there are things that are true of this king thatat least \nultimatelycannot be said to be true of human beings. For example, \nthe king is portrayed as having a different nature from man (he is a \ncherub, verse 14); he had a different position from man (he was \nblameless and sinless, verse 15); he was in a different realm from \nman (the holy mount of God, verses 13,14); he received a different \njudgment from man (he was cast out of the mountain of God and thrown \nto the earth, verse 16); and the superlatives used to describe him \ndon't seem to fit that of a normal human being (full of wisdom, \nperfect in beauty, and having the seal of perfection, verse 12 \nNASB). \u0014\n\u0014\nOur text tells us that this king was a created being and left the \ncreative hand of God in a perfect state (Ezekiel 28:12,15). And he \nremained perfect in his ways until iniquity was found in him (verse \n15b). What was this iniquity? We read in verse 17, Your heart became \nproud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom \nbecause of your splendor. Lucifer apparently became so impressed \nwith his own beauty, intelligence, power, and position that he began \nto desire for himself the honor and glory that belonged to God alone. \nThe sin that corrupted Lucifer was self-generated pride.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently, this represents the actual beginning of sin in the \nuniversepreceding the fall of the human Adam by an indeterminate \ntime. Sin originated in the free will of Lucifer in whichwith full \nunderstanding of the issues involvedhe chose to rebel against the \nCreator. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis mighty angelic being was rightfully judged by God: I threw you \nto the earth (Ezekiel 28:18). This doesn't mean that Satan had no \nfurther access to heaven, for other Scripture verses clearly indicate \nthat Satan maintained this access even after his fall (\\Job 1:6-12; \n\\Zechariah 3:1,2). However, \\Ezekiel 28:18 indicates that Satan was \nabsolutely and completely cast out of God's heavenly government and \nhis place of authority (\\Luke 10:18). \u0014\n\u0014\n\\Isaiah 14:12-17 is another Old Testament passage that may refer to \nthe fall of Lucifer. We must be frank in admitting that some Bible \nscholars see no reference whatsoever to Lucifer in this passage. It \nis argued that the being mentioned in this verse is referred to as a \nman (Isaiah 14:16); is compared with other kings on the earth (verse \n18); and the words, How you have fallen from heaven (verse 12), is \nalleged to refer to a fall from great political heights. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are other scholars who interpret this passage as referring only \nto the fall of Lucifer, with no reference whatsoever to a human king. \nThe argument here is that the description of this being is beyond \nhumanness and hence could not refer to a mere mortal man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a third view that I think is preferable to the two views \nabove. This view sees Isaiah 14:12-17 as having a dual reference. It \nmay be that verses 4 through 11 deal with an actual king of Babylon. \nThen, in verses 12 through 17, we find a dual reference that includes \nnot just the king of Babylon but a typological description of Lucifer \nas well. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf this passage contains a reference to the fall of Lucifer, then the \npattern of this passage would seem to fit that of the Ezekiel 28 \nreferencethat is, first a human leader is described, and then dual \nreference is made to a human leader and Satan. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is significant that the language used to describe this being fits \nother passages in the Bible that speak about Satan. For example, the \nfive I wills in Isaiah 14 indicate an element of pride, which was \nalso evidenced in Ezekiel 28:17 (cf. \\1 Timothy 3:6 which makes \nreference to Satan's conceit). \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result of this heinous sin against God, Lucifer was banished \nfrom living in heaven (Isaiah 14:12). He became corrupt, and his name \nchanged from Lucifer (morning star) to Satan (adversary). His \npower became completely perverted (Isaiah 14:12,16,17). And his \ndestiny, following the second coming of Christ, is to be bound in a \npit during the 1000-year millennial kingdom over which Christ will \nrule (\\Revelation 20:3), and eventually will be thrown into the lake \nof fire (\\Matthew 25:41).\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n** A fundamentalist view of these scriptures\u0014\n\u0014\nRon Rhodes, president of Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries, is \nheard regularly on nationwide radio and is the author of Christianity \nAccording to the Bible\u0014",

    "words": "Some recognize the name, Harriet Tubman. Before the Civil War Harriet \nwas one of the most courageous leaders of the Underground Railroad, \nleading at least 300 slaves to their freedom in the North. At one \npoint in her courageous journeys, Harriet had a premonition that her \nthree brothers, all still slaves, were in trouble. She decided then \nand there that her brothers would be with her on the next Underground \nRailroad to the North. With the help of a literate friend, she sent a \ncoded letter to her three brothers. In those days, the authorities \noften read the mail of influential black people, looking for any \nsuspicious anti-slave activity. So Harriets code to her brothers \nthat they should follow her to freedom was as follows: Read my \nletter to the old folks, and give my love to them, and tell my \nbrothers to be always watching unto prayer, and when the good old \nship of Zion comes along, to be ready to step on board.\u0014\nOne of Harriets Underground Railroad stops was at her parents \ncabin. She and her fellow travelers would hide out in the barn. \nBecause Harriets mother was given to outbursts of screaming and \ncrying whenever she was happy, it was impossible for them to let her \nmother know they were there. Instead, they subtly alerted Harriets \nfather to their presence. Before Harriets father entered the barn, \nhe put a blindfold over his eyes. He knew the authorities would come \nto ask him if he had seen Harriet, and he wanted to be able to say \nno truthfully. \u0014\n  \u0014\nOne reason that Harriets coded messages contained biblical \nreferences is that African-American slaves could relate to the \nmessage of freedom that the Bible proclaims.\u0014",

The two were \nwed four years later (37 BCE) in Samaria. Mariamne bore Herod four \nchildren: two sons, Alexandros and Aristobulus (both executed in 7 \nBCE), and two daughters, Salampsio and Cypros. A fifth child (male), \ndrowned at a young age  likely in the Pontine Marshes near Rome, \nafter Herod's sons had been sent to receive educations in Rome in 20 \nBCE. \u0014\n\u0014\nJosephus writes that it was because of Mariamne's vehement insistence \nthat Herod made her brother Aristobulos a High Priest. Aristobulos, \nwho was not even eighteen years old, drowned (in 36 BCE) within a \nyear of his appointment; Alexandra, his mother, blamed Herod. \nAlexandra wrote to Cleopatra, begging her assistance in avenging the \nboy's murder. Cleopatra in turn urged Mark Antony to punish Herod for \nthe crime, and Antony sent for him to make his defense. Herod left \nhis young wife in the care of his uncle Joseph, along with the \ninstructions that if Antony should kill him, Joseph should kill \nMariamne. Herod believed his wife to be so beautiful that she would \nbecome engaged to another man after his death and that his great \npassion for Mariamne prevented him from enduring a separation from \nher, even in death.\u0014\n\u0014\n Joseph became familiar with the queen and eventually divulged this \ninformation to her and the other women of the household, which did \nnot have the hoped-for effect of proving Herod's devotion to his \nwife. Rumors soon circulated that Herod had been killed by Antony, \nand Alexandra persuaded Joseph to take Mariamne and her to the Roman \nlegions for protection. However, Herod was released by Antony and \nreturned home, only to be informed of Alexandra's plan by his mother \nand sister, Salome. \u0014\n\u0014\nSalome also accused Mariamne of committing adultery with Joseph, a \ncharge which Herod initially dismissed after discussing it with his \nwife. After Herod forgave her, Mariamne inquired about the order \ngiven to Joseph to kill her should Herod be killed, and Herod then \nbecame convinced of her infidelity, saying that Joseph would only \nhave confided that to her were the two of them intimate. He gave \norders for Joseph to be executed and for Alexandra to be confined, \nbut Herod did not punish his wife. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of this conflict between Mariamne and Salome, when Herod \nvisited Augustus in Rhodes in 31 BCE, he separated the women. He left \nhis sister and his sons in Masada while he moved his wife and \nmother-in-law to Alexandrium. Again, Herod left instructions that \nshould he die, the charge of the government was to be left to Salome \nand his sons, and Mariamne and her mother were to be killed. Mariamne \nand Alexandra were left in the charge of another man named Sohemus, \nand after gaining his trust again learned of the instructions Herod \nprovided should harm befall him. Mariamne became convinced that Herod \ndid not truly love her and resented that he would not let her survive \nhim. When Herod returned home, Mariamne treated him coldly and did \nnot conceal her hatred for him. \u0014\n\u0014\nSalome and her mother preyed on this opportunity, feeding Herod false \ninformation to fuel his dislike. Herod still favored her; but she \nrefused to have sexual relations with him and accused him of killing \nher grandfather, Hyrcanus II, and her brother. Salome insinuated that \nMariamne planned to poison Herod, and Herod had Mariamne's favorite \neunuch tortured to learn more. The eunuch knew nothing of a plot to \npoison the king, but confessed the only thing he did know: that \nMariamne was dissatisfied with the king because of the orders given \nto Sohemus. Outraged, Herod called for the immediate execution of \nSohemus, but permitted Mariamne to stand trial for the alleged murder \nplot. To gain favor with Herod, Mariamne's mother even implied \nMariamne was plotting to commit lse majest. Mariamne was ultimately \nconvicted and executed in 29 BCE. Herod grieved for her for many \nmonths.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a Talmudic passage concerning the marriage and death of \nMariamne, although her name is not mentioned. When the whole house of \nthe Hasmoneans had been rooted out, she threw herself from a roof and \nwas killed. She committed suicide because Herod had spared her life, \nso that he could marry her. If he were to marry her, then he would be \nable to claim that he was not actually a slave, but rather that he \nhad royal blood. Out of love for her, Herod is said to have kept her \nbody preserved in honey for seven years.\u0014",

    "title": "HEAVEN OR HELL THEOLOGY?",
    "words": "Heaven-or-hell theology may be simple, but it is neither biblical nor \nmorally defensible. Whats the alternative?\u0014\nALAN BEAN  |  MARCH 5, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you believe in hell? If so, youve got a lot of company.\u0014\n\u0014\nA poll by the Pew Research Center found that 82 percent of \nevangelical Christians (regardless of race) believe in hell. \nCatholics (63 percent) were a bit less likely to fear eternal \nconscious torment, but even among mainline Protestants (60 percent) \nit remains the majority view. Since mainline Protestants rarely if \never mention eternal damnation from the pulpit or in denominational \ncurricula, one wonders why infernalism (the technical term) remains \nso strong among the faithful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fear of eternal conscious torment is a terrific attention \ngrabber. And heaven-or-hell religion is simple enough to be \nunderstood by virtually everyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides, if the sermons of the late evangelist Billy Graham are \nanything to go by, tickets to heaven can be snapped up on the cheap. \nPray the sinners prayer and youre in. Good works, as Billy never \ntired of reminding us, have no bearing on your eternal destiny.\u0014\nMore importantly, the threat of perdition provides the church with a \nstirring raison detre. We hold preaching services and we send \nmissionaries to save souls from hell. Full stop.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, the fastest growing religious group in America is \nthose without religious affiliation of any kind. Another Pew poll \nfound that 4 in 10 millennials (those currently between 24 and 39) \nfall into this category. In Americas youngest cadre of adults, in \nother words, there are as many nones as Christians. As one headline \ndeclared, Millennials Are Leaving Religion And Not Coming Back.\u0014\nIf God is love, Millennials ask, how can God gleefully consign the \nlions share of the population to eternal conscious torment? All the \nBuddhists and Hindus and Muslims? All the atheists and agnostics? And \nwhat about the millions of people who lack the mental capacity to \ncheck the right theological box?\u0014\n\u0014\nHeaven-or-hell theology is neither biblical nor morally defensible.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his splendid book, That All Shall be Saved: Heaven, Hell and \nUniversal Salvation (Yale University Press, 2019), Eastern Orthodox \ntheologian David Bentley Hart argues that the concept of eternal \ndamnation is unbiblical and morally abhorrent. Hart has an earned \nreputation as a conservative scholar, so his conclusions have nothing \nto do with being soft on sin or rejecting the clear teaching of the \nBible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first stanza of the books title is Harts translation of 1 \nTimothy 2:4 which states that God desires that all shall be saved. \nBeyond the treatment of specific biblical texts, Hart returns \nrepeatedly to a central theological question: How can the blessed in \nheaven exist in a state of rapturous bliss while their friends and \nfamily members who never got around to praying the sinners prayer \nwrithe in endless agony?\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventy years ago, when my parents were starting out in married life, \nthis question rarely came up. Everybody went to church, at least on \noccasion, and even most of those who didnt show up on Sundays still \nidentified as Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when 40 percent of your age cohort has no affiliation with \norganized religion and everyone has agnostic or atheist friends, the \nidea that only Christians make it through the pearly gates becomes \nhighly problematic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is particularly true when so many professing Christians show \nlittle of their Masters compassion for the poor and the outcast.\u0014\nHarts accessible, 232-page work reminds us that references to \nuniversal salvation abound in scripture. John the Baptist sees Jesus \nwalking down the road and cries, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh \naway the sin of the world. Later in Johns gospel Jesus declares: \nAnd I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to \nmyself.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my work as a hospice chaplain I have discovered that virtually all \nTexans of a certain age can quote John 3:16 from memory (invariably \nfrom the King James Version): For God so loved the world, that he \ngave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should \nnot perish, but have everlasting life. Few, however, have memorized \nthe verse that follows: For God sent not his Son into the world to \ncondemn the world but that the world, through him, might be saved.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1 Timothy the writer celebrates God our Savior, who desires \neveryone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For \nthere is one God; there is also one mediator between God and \nhumankind, Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for \nall. And theres 1 Corinthians 15:22: For as in Adam all die, so \nalso in Christ shall all be made alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe clearest enunciation of this teaching comes in the second chapter \nof Philippians where Paul, likely quoting an early Christian hymn, \nhails that great gettin up morning when at the name of Jesus every \nknee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and \nevery tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God \nthe Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll shall be saved. Its in the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe objections are obvious. If everyone will be saved, why did Jesus \nhave so much to say about hell? For example, why does the parable of \nthe sheep and the goats (Matthew 25) conclude with these chilling \nwords: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared \nfor the devil and his angels?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf God is love, Millennials ask, how can God gleefully consign the \nlions share of the population to eternal conscious torment?\u0014\nHow do we harmonize all shall be saved with depart into the \neternal fire? Which option should we favor?\u0014\n\u0014\nMust we, as theologian Jurgen Moltmann suggests, choose between the \ndual-destiny eschatology of Matthew and Mark and the universalism of \nJohn and Paul (the apostles, not Lennon and McCartney)?\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont think so.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we take the sheep and goats passage in Matthew 25 literally, \nwere all in deep trouble. The passage has nothing to do with \naccepting Jesus as your personal Savior. It is our contempt for the \nincarcerated, the poor, the hungry and the refugee that places us in \nthe goat column: For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was \nthirsty and you gave me no drink, was a stranger and you did not \nwelcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and \nyou did not visit me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe parable of Lazarus and the rich man Dives (Luke 16) is probably \nthe second most famous hell passage in the New Testament. A great and \nunbridgeable divide separates the saved who rest in Abrahams bosom \nfrom the damned who languish in a sea of flame.\u0014\nBut once again, there is no connection between praying the Sinners \nPrayer and getting saved; the crucial issue, as in Matthew 25, is \nhow we behave toward the least and the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 10th chapter of Marks Gospel offers up a similar dilemma. The \nman traditionally identified as the rich young ruler has checked \nall the religious boxes, but he isnt ready to give all his \npossessions to the poor and then follow Jesus. As the poor fellow \nwalks away sorrowfully, Jesus turns to his disciples and says, It is \neasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich \nman to enter the kingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disciples are shocked, even scandalized. If societys leading \ncitizens are unworthy of the kingdom, what chance do the rest of us \nhave? If this religious paragon doesnt make the cut, they ask, Then \nwho can be saved?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs of the day I wrote this column, 10 percent of my retirement \ninvestments has vanished in the course of a single week. Donald Trump \nand Michael Bloomberg might qualify as rich, but Im feeling \nfinancially vulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorth Americans comprise five percent of the worlds population but \ncontrol over a third of the planets wealth. By global standards, I \nam wealthy  and I would prefer to maintain that position. Which \nmakes me a goat.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont want to be a goat. Like Marks rich young man, I turn away \nfrom Jesus with tears in my eyes and an ache in my heart. But I turn \naway all the same. My addiction to the blessings of life has turned \nmy heart to stone.\u0014\nIn the Synoptic Gospels, strangely, the riffraff are ushered into the \nkingdom party whether they hold a ticket or not. Its those of us who \nsuffer from a blessing addiction that end up on the outside looking \nin.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich is why our salvation is, humanly speaking, impossible. \nFortunately, all things are possible with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Romans 8, Paul makes a similar point when he says the world has \nbeen subjected to futility. There is the existential futility of \nknowing that weakness and death are drawing closer every day. There \nis the moral futility Paul talks about in the preceding chapter: For \nI do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I \ndo. There are the systemic or social forms of futility revealed in \nviolence, war and oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world groans under the weight of futility, the seeming \nimpossibility that the world can ever be saved from its bondage to \ndeath and decay. Even those who walk with Jesus groan inwardly for \nthe road to the kingdom is long and our legs are weak. Even the \nSpirit of God groans deep inside us.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Paul remains convinced that the sufferings of this present time \nare not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. \nWe are like a woman in the throes of labor, the Apostle says. Our \npain is productive. God is transforming groans into glory. The gospel \nmagic is working. We can feel it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the hospice patients I work with are told that their pain is \nproductive everything changes. The rich young man couldnt give away \nall that he had, but the widow who tossed her coins into the treasury \ncould. Likewise, my patients have given it all away. All that remains \nis the pain, the groaning, the impossible futility of a pointless \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey dont need to understand how their world got so twisted and \nunfair; they just need to believe that God is still working. One day, \nI tell my patients, God is going to straighten everything thats \ncrooked, mend everything thats broken, heal everything thats sick \nand wipe every tear from our eyes. When I say it, their eyes light \nup. Only then do I believe it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats why, in this season of Lent, we remind ourselves that we are \ndust and to dust we shall return. Thats the only cure for our \nblessing addiction.\u0014\nOn my way to church I pass I sign that screams, Where will you go \nwhen you die: heaven or hell? Most of our churches have left that \nkind of theology far behind, but were afraid to offer a viable \nalternative.\u0014\n\u0014\nHart is right. Heaven-or-hell theology is neither biblical nor \nmorally defensible. But for people who get their religious \ninformation from TV preachers and roadside billboards it is the only \nkind of Christianity on the market.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe time has come for moderate and progressive mainline preachers to \ntalk about the biblical vision of universal redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we dont know what to say, we can just echo the language of \nscripture. Sure, its all poetry and parable, language designed to \nexpress the inexpressible. But its the only language weve got, and \nits enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod is love. God loves the world and is redeeming every inch of it. \nAnd someday God will preside over the marriage of heaven and earth.\u0014\nIm not sure what that means, but I plan to be there to see it happen.\u0014",

Greek men were commonly bisexual; not only was homosexual \nbehavior approved (some writers, like speakers in Plato's Symposium, \npreferred it to heterosexual behavior), but elements of the culture \nsocialized boys in this direction. Men and women were segregated \ngrowing up, and male bonds became close. Apparently due to a \ndeficiency in the number of women (which many attribute to female \ninfanticide), marriages were often made between thirty-year-old men \nand fourteen-year-old women, whom the men saw as children. Men had \naccess to only three forms of sexual release until such late \nmarriages: slaves, prostitutes and other men. (Introducing boys to \nhomoerotic pleasure was a favorite pastime of Greek men in this \nperiod.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough many upper-class Romans were affected by Greek ideals, many \nother Romans, especially Roman philosophers, regarded homosexual \npractice as disgusting. Greco-Roman moralists sometimes opposed \ngender reversal as \"against nature,\" which would resemble the Jewish \nargument from God's original purposes in creation (Gen 2:18). \nAlthough Jewish texts speak of Jewish adulterers and thieves, they \nnearly always treat homosexual behavior as a *Gentile practice. \n(Socialization clearly affected one's sexual development.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul did not choose this example of sin to be controversial with his \nreaders; his Jewish and Roman Christian readers alike would have \nagreed with him that both idolatry and homosexual behavior are \nsinful. But this example is a setup for his critique of sins less \noften denounced (Rom 1:28-32). \u0014\n\u0014\n1:28-32. Ancient writers (Greek, Roman, Jewish; cf. also Lev 18) \nsometimes employed \"vice lists,\" as here. But unlike idolatry and \nhomosexuality (Rom 1:18-27), sins like greed, jealousy, slander, \narrogance and ignorance also occur in Jewish lists as sins some \nJewish people committed. Like Amos (see Amos 1-2), Paul here sets up \nhis readers for chapter 2: pagans are not the only ones who are \ndamned. \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n(from IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament by Craig S. \nKeener Copyright  1993 by Craig S.

    "title": "HALLELUJAH! HANDEL'S MASTERPIECE",
    "words": "Hallelujah! Handel's Masterpiece\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nAt twelve noon, on this date, April 13, 1742, the world first heard \nthe lovely overture, memorable arias and majestic choruses of the \nmost famous oratorio ever written. There has not been a year since \nthen that George Frederick Handel's Messiah has not been performed in \nconcert halls around the world. Usually it appears in numerous halls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe performance took place in Dublin, in the Fishamble Street Musick \nHall. Dubliners received it with enthusiasm. \"...the best judges \nallowed it to be the most finished piece of music,\" wrote the Dublin \nGazette. \"Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it \nafforded...\" Two performances were given. Two years later, annual \nperformances were established in Dublin. London did not receive the \noratorio as readily. Criticized, it did not catch on there until 1749.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel had turned to oratorios, most of them on religious themes, \nafter opera failed him. Messiah was special even within its genre. \nThe composer deliberately wrote it so that it could be performed by \nas few as four singers with strings, continuo, two drums and two \ntrumpets. The idea was to produce a work which could be staged \nanywhere. Handel was often near destitution, and a piece like \nMessiah, which could be performed by small ensembles, offered him \nopportunities to raise desperately needed cash.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe text, by Charles Jennens, pulled together fragments of scripture \nrelating to Christ. The power of the scriptures came by laying them \nforth almost as translated (he used more than one translation where \nit suited his purpose) and joining them so that they built on and \nclarified one another without comment. Old and New Testament passages \nwere placed beside each other where a relationship existed. Where \nJennens modified passages, he did so to make them scan better and to \nkeep the texts in the third tense throughout. \u0014\n\u0014\nHandel, although a rough-tongued man, claimed to know the Bible as \nwell as any bishop and made a few alterations himself. Jennens, a \ndevout Anglican, intended through his libretto to challenge the \nDeists who denied Christ's divinity: \"And his name shall be called \nWonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the \nPrince of Peace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe succeeded in his intent, for Messiah portrays Christ as Son of \nGod, the fulfillment of prophecy, Savior of the world, and coming \nKing. John Newton, slaver turned clergyman, preached fifty sermons on \nthe text. Although Newton preached his series as a rebuke to those \nwho glorified the music above God's word, he said that it \ncomprehended all the principle truths of the Gospel. That Jennens \nfused the words together without once backtracking or repeating a \npassage demonstrates the perfectionism which made him a fussy person.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel united the whole into a magnificent artwork, writing the work \nin twenty-three fervent days, despite having already suffered a \nstroke. The music often rises to great loveliness and power. Passion \nbuilds until the climactic Hallelujah chorus. Of this chorus, Handel \nsaid in his broken English, \"I did think I did see all heaven before \nme and the great God himself!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarne, Kitty.

    "title": "HONING YOUR SPIRIT",
    "words": "Honing Your Spirit\u0014\n\u0014\n John Chrysostom, the renowned preacher and Doctor of the Church,  is \nportrayed by Harold Senkbeil as a spiritual doctor of souls. The \ndecision to receive treatment does not lie with the man who \nadministers the medicine but actually with the patient, Chrysostom \nwrote, calling for tact and patience among pastors, lest in rushing \nahead with uninvited spiritual care [we] jeopardize the health and \nlife of the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn earned the moniker Chrysostom because of his preaching \n(Chrysostom is Greek for golden mouth). Born in 347 A.D. in Syria \nand raised by his pious mother, Chrysostom was on track for law \nschool when he got the call to be a priest. His preaching, which had \nalready commenced while at preparing for priesthood, garnered him \nsuch acclaim among the faithful that within ten years of his \nordination he was elevated (though only five feet tall) to Archbishop \nof Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the hundreds of sermons that survived him was one titled \nConcerning the Power of Demons. Chrysostom believed that the devil \nwas a necessary evil, required for your spiritual growth. Satans \npower stems from his fraudulence, the deceit that deludes and leads \nus astray. If Satans destined to be thrown into a lake of fire at \nthe end of history as Revelation predicts, why not do it now and get \nit over with?\u0014\n\u0014\nChrysostom employed the common Biblical analogy of athletics to make \nhis case:\u0014\n\u0014\nSay that there are two athletes pitted against a single adversary. \nOne athlete is consumed with gluttony, he is unprepared, void of \nstrength, nerveless. But the other is diligent, of good habit, \npassing his time in the wrestling school, in many gymnastic \nexercises, and exhibiting all the practice which bears upon the \ncontest. Now if you take away the one adversary, which of the two \nathletes is injured? The slothful and unprepared, or the earnest one \nwho has toiled so much? It is quite clear that it is the earnest one. \nThe slothful was destined to fall anyway, due to his slothfulness. \nThe earnest, however, with no one against whom to wield his training, \ndeteriorates into a good-for-nothing thraniopatata [which in Greek \nmeans, couch potato].\u0014\n\u0014\nChrysostom asserted that the devil is not currently vanquished \nbecause you need him. If all you ever do is scrimmage in life, youll \neventually grow weak in faith. You need an opponent; you need trouble \nand suffering to keep spiritually sharp.\u0014",

    "words": "HIS MOTHER COULDNT READ, BUT \nHE DIDNT KNOW IT.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Benjamin Carson, renowned surgeon, told a moving story about his \nmother. Mrs. Carson insisted that Ben and his brother Curtis write a \nbook report every couple of weeks. This wasn't for schoolthis was \nfor their mom. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBen and Curtis dutifully obeyed for years. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAbout the time he was in junior high, Ben finally realized something \nabsolutely shocking. His mom couldn't read. For years Ben had read \nbooks and scratched out reports, assuming that his mom was checking \nevery word, but she didn't have a clue what he was saying. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tNow consider this: raised by an illiterate mother, Ben grew up to be \na world-famous surgeon who was featured in many articles and was the \nauthor of several books. His illiterate mom didn't wring her hands \nover her lack of learning and give up hope of raising intelligent \nboys. Instead, she gave her boys what she hadencouragement, interest \nin learning, accountability, determination, the courage to demand \nextra work, and character. And it paid off in spades.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIf there is any one great symbol for \"goodness\" to people the world \nover, it is the word, \"Mother.

    "title": "HERMAN GELLER'S STORY OF THE HOLOCAUST",
    "words": "In November, 1957, I was in seminary in Ft. Worth, Texas \nand in the insurance business. I called on the Geller family. The \nhusband was a quiet dignified businessman who had formed his own \ndressmaking company. The mother sold eggs to help with the family's \nexpenses. They had a beautiful, vivacious, dark-haired daughter nine \nyears old, smart as a whip with an absolutely charming personality.  \nI had seen her with her mother several times. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn our conversation, I asked Mr. Geller if they had other children. \nHe didn't answer. I thought he hadn't heard me, so I repeated the \nquestion. He sat still and stared straight ahead as though he was \nlooking at something I could not see. Then I could tell he had heard \nmy question but wasn't answering.  What happened next was bone \nchilling.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe sat there.  His face gave no evidence of crying but tears began \nto flow slowly down his face.  I saw an expression in his eyes I had \nnever seen before nor have I ever seen since. Through a pain even I \ncould feel, he slowly said, \"We had four others.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tMrs. Geller came in the room and said softly, \"We lost four children \nin the war.\" I was young in 1957.  I had been a history major in \ncollege and even remembered as a child seeing something about the \ndeath camps in the papers in 1945. I remember how terrible they \nseemed at the time. My best friend in Elementary School was a Jewish \nboy named Gilbert  Grossman. He talked with me about some of those \nthings.  But by 1957 all of that had long since receded into the \narchives of my mind. Mr. Geller said, \"We lost them in Auschwitz.\" I \nfroze, I think, physically and psychologically. \"We lost them in the \ncamp,\" he continued.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tI apologized for inquiring about what was obviously a very delicate \nsubject, and he said, \"It's all right\", looking straight ahead.  \nSheepishly I inquired if I might ask how they died.  Both the Gellers \nshook their heads indicating it was all right. I sat very still, as \nhe did, and watched his eyes become inflamed with hatred as he \ntalked, always looking straight ahead as though looking at something \nI couldn't see.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe told me of having been taken as a family to the camp, the \ncombination labor and killing center.  The SS men took him and his \nfamily to a certain place and told him and his wife to start digging \na grave for their children. They refused and were savagely beaten. \nThis happened several times. Finally, other workers dug the grave. \nThe children were placed along the edge of the grave, knocked in the \nhead with the butt of rifles. They fell into the grave. The Gellers \nwere given shovels and told to cover them up with dirt.  Again, they \nrefused and were viciously beaten. Finally, the SS men held the \nGellers and made them stand there as slave laborers covered up the \nchildrenwhile they were still alive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tI had three children then, and I felt naked in that room. For the \nfirst time in my life I understood why some have said, \"Never \nforgive! Never forget!\"  My friends, I am a father. Fathers don't \nmake up stories like that.  Herman Geller did not make up that story; \nit happened.\u0014",

    "title": "HISTORY CAN BE UGLY--A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "\"The Warmth of Other Suns\" is a book that I think should be mandatory \nthat every white person residing in the United States between the \nages of 9 and 90 read. I dont mean that in a harsh way. When one \nlooks at the many accusations of racism as we approach the second \ndecade of the twentieth century, its too easy for most white \nAmericans to think that there isnt a problem with racism in our \ncountry anymore, and the problems that we had were taken care of many \nyears ago. I would guess 99% of African Americans would strongly \ndisagree. Most would probably argue that whereas there have been \ngreat strides in the last half-century, there are still many more \nproblems, and we have a long long way to go before there is any sort \nof racial equality.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas this book is definitely about the past, the feeling that \none comes away with is that the past was so harsh and brutal for \npeople of color, and the obstacles so insurmountable, that its \nsimply impossible to think that things such as a Civil Rights Bill \nand Affirmative Action can remotely begin to heal the many misdeeds \nand scars. When one and ones family have lived in oppression for \nhundreds of years, a much more concerted effort by all is needed to \nmake the many wrongs right.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book essentially tells the story of three black Americans that \nwere born in the Jim Crow South in the early parts of the twentieth \ncentury where racism is considered normal and slavery has really been \nabolished in name only. This was a time and a place so violent that \nan ignorant white man could legally hang a black man if that man \ntalked back to him or refused to step aside on the sidewalk to let \nhis white superior counterpart pass. The three main characters each \nlive about a decade apart, and each one resides in a different State \nin the South. Their lives and trades are all different, but the \ntravails they face are oh so common.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese three individuals have the same stories of thousands, if not \nmillions of black people that resided in the South. For them it was \nonly a generation or so ago that their ancestors resided there \nbecause they were legal property. After slavery is abolished in 1863, \nlives get slowly better for people of color in the deep South, but at \nsome point near the turn of the twentieth century, its almost as if \nthe white people on the losing side of the U.S. Civil War are still \nso bitter over their loss, that Jim Crow laws are passed that \nessentially strip away the freedoms of black people all over the \nSouth. The option many black people choose after being fed up with \nyears of injustice? They migrate to the North along with their meager \nbelongings where things are supposedly better.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetter doesnt mean good, and this is where this true story can \nreally sink ones misguided optimism. During a span of about 50 years \n(from 1919 to 1969), larger cities in the north such as Detroit, \nMilwaukee, New York, and Chicago see these destitute individuals \narrive in multitudes in search of nothing more than basic dignity. \nLife is much easier in the North, but in an era where Americans were \nstill tribal, the newly arrived migrants arent necessarily welcomed \nwith open arms. The newly arrived black population finds themselves \nregulated to segregated slums and having to scrounge for jobs. It \nseems like no matter how bad a company might need to hire labor, many \nwhite people refuse to work next to a black person, so companies \nwont hire the migrants, and the job search becomes much harder, if \nnot impossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the criticisms of this book is that Ms. Wilkerson doesnt tell \nher story in a linear fashion. We jump around quite a bit amongst the \nthree narratives. The fact that each of these three people began \ntheir migration in a different decade doesnt help one keep the \naccounts straight either. After a while, I confess that I couldnt \nreally keep up with the many relatives and relations of the three \ncharacters. This really didnt take away from my fascination of the \nbook. The author does a wonderful job explaining to the reader what \nher characters were going through at the time, and as horrific as \nmost of them were, it manages to hit the point home for the reader in \na major way.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe also does a masterful job peppering her story with current events \nand anecdotes throughout the narrative that drive her thesis home. \nFor example, we read about Olympic Gold Medal winner Jesse Owens who \ntriumphed in Berlin in 1936. Adolph Hitler refused to acknowledge \nthat a black athlete was superior to his Aryan race, so he literally \nturned his back on Owens during the award presentation. The irony \nhere is that in Berlin, Owens was at least allowed to stay in the \nsame hotel as his white teammates. In his own country, however, the \nhero not only had to stay in a different, subpar hotel during the \nOlympic celebration, but he was also forced to enter and exit the \nhotel through the service entrance.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the subject matter here isnt pleasant, but its a very necessary \nhistory lesson. Although the author doesnt explicitly connect the \ndots, she seems to allege that the many present-day problems that \npeople of color encounter in their daily lives in crack infested \nneighborhoods are a direct result from the neglect, hatred, and \nisolation of years past during the migration. Yes, there have been \nstrides to improve these situations, we still have quite a journey \nahead of us.\u0014",

    "words": "Joseph Gilmore's Memorable Hymn\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph Henry Gilmore died on this day July 23, 1918, he had \ntaught for many years at the University of Rochester in New York and \nauthored several books on literature. He is remembered in educational \ncircles for these contributions and others. But in Christian circles \nhe is remembered for a single hymn written over half a century before \nhis death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1862, as a 28-year-old student who was about to become a pastor, \nHenry was invited to preach at the historic First Baptist Church of \nPhiladelphia. \"I set out to give the people an exposition of the \nTwenty-third Psalm. I had given this exposition on three or four \nother occasions; but this time I did not get beyond the words 'He \nleadeth me.' So greatly impressed was I with the blessedness of \ndivine guidance that I made this my theme.\" He later felt that the \ndark days of the Civil War may have subconsciously led him to focus \non God's leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the close of the meeting, Henry and some others went to the home \nof a deacon. \"There,\" he wrote, \"we continued our discussion of \ndivine guidance. While I was still talking and listening, I wrote on \na piece of my exposition manuscript the words to this hymn. I handed \nthe paper to my wife and more or less forgot the incident.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words that Henry had written began with this famous stanza:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe leadeth me! O blessed tho't!\u0014\nO words with heav'nly comfort fraught!\u0014\nWhat-e'er I do, wher-e'er I be,\u0014\nStill 'tis God's hand that leadeth me!\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years later, having pastored for some time in New Hampshire, \nHenry was invited to preach a trial sermon at the Second Baptist \nChurch in Rochester. \"I picked up a church hymnal to see what songs \nthey sang and was surprised to have the book fall open to the very \nsong I had written three years earlier,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I returned home, I related this experience to my wife. 'I do \nnot understand it,' I said. 'My words had been set to music by Dr. \nWilliam B. Bradbury; yet I had not given the words to anybody.' My \nwife smiled and said, 'I can explain it, Joseph. I felt that the \nwords would bless the hearts of people in these troublesome times; so \nI sent the poem to The Watchman and Reflector. I am glad to know that \nthey have printed it.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous hymn composer William Bradbury had seen the lines and \nadded music and the last two lines of the chorus. Henry took this \nincident as divine leadership that he should accept a situation at \nthe Rochester church. That put him in position two years later to \naccept an offer to teach Hebrew at Rochester Theological Seminary. \nThe following year, he was offered a professorship of logic and \nEnglish literature at the University of Rochester, which he held \nuntil his retirement in 1908. An English chair at the school is named \nafter him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah. The Story of the Hymns and \nTunes. New York: George H.

Given my role as an in-house \njournalist, we came in contact quite a lot. I heard him speak so \noften, I could have repeated his spiel.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeres what I thought then and now: Henry Blackaby was not of this \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nOriginally, that drove me nuts because he was  as the saying goes  \nso heavenly minded he was of little earthly good. He was a mystic, a \nprophet, a single-minded preacher. He had found a good line  find \nout where God is working the world and join God there  and applied \nit to everything.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it was the solemn assemblies that really threw me off track. Back \nin those days, Henry was like John the Baptist crying in the \nwilderness, calling the faithful to repent of their sins  publicly. \nHe based that call on an obscure passage about repentance in the Old \nTestament. The gist of it was that churches and denominational groups \nwere encouraged to have revival-like meetings that resulted in public \nconfession and repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1990, a Baptist Press article quoted Blackaby and others to \nexplain what was a new term among Southern Baptists: Solemn \nassembly is a biblical term, a call to prayer and fasting issued \nfrom God to the people through revered church leaders, and it comes \nout of the book of Job, said Henry Blackaby, director of prayer and \nspiritual awakening at the Southern Baptist Home Mission Board.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlackaby added this is a very solemn gathering of the people of God \nto come face to face with God and discuss what he has on his agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also said: Solemn assembly is a time to read Gods word, \nunderstand that God is speaking to us and that we must respond to \nGod. It is not only a Bible study time but an encounter with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor about a five-year period, solemn assemblies became all the rage. \nSeemingly everyone was calling a solemn assembly. Even the SBC \nExecutive Committee  in the midst of being used to manipulate the \nconservative resurgence and forcing denominational leaders out of \ntheir jobs  held a solemn assembly that was a farce.\u0014\n\u0014\nReports circulated widely of odd things happening at other solemn \nassemblies  including husbands confessing before the entire church, \nwithout their wives advance knowledge, that they were having \nextramarital affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not all just distant history. In 2022, members of the SBC \nExecutive Committee were called to a yet another solemn assembly at \nFalls Creek retreat center in Oklahoma. That was just months after \nthe Guidepost Solutions report presented a damning image of the \nExecutive Committee staff and leaders in their mishandling of sexual \nabuse claims.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in the early 1990s, the solemn assembly birthed a cottage \nindustry for Blackaby, who didnt make money off this but appeared to \nbe motivated genuinely by his prophetic role.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the way, even his bestselling book, Experiencing God, which first \nput Blackaby on the map and gave him a platform, reportedly didnt \nmake him much money even though the book sold more than 8 million \ncopies. His publishing contract with the Baptist Sunday School Board \napparently didnt give him standard royalties. If it had, he would \nhave become a multi-millionaire. But he didnt.\u0014\n\u0014\nSolemn assemblies didnt feel authentic to me. They felt like \nmanipulative religion. And for many denominational leaders engaged in \nunethical and unbiblical behavior related to the politics of the SBC, \nthey became hypocritical performative religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet I never attributed those same qualities to Henry. Again, he \nappeared to be not of this world. He acted like all that political \nactivity didnt matter, wasnt important. Its like he couldnt see \nit and couldnt be bothered by it. He was sent to deliver a \nparticular message to whoever would hear it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fundamentalists of the SBC used him for their purposes while it \nwas beneficial. Then his message spread to other denominations and \nreligious groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenrys best gift to the Christian world was that one line: Find out \nwhere God is working the world and join God there. But the reality \nis, God is working everywhere in the world, not just in some places. \nAnd God can be experienced anywhere, any time.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever influence Henry hoped to have on the SBC, it doesnt appear \nto have taken institutionally. Perhaps individual lives were truly \nchanged, but institutions were not changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope Henry has met John the Baptist in eternity. I suspect they \nhave a lot to talk about.\u0014\n \u0014\nMark Wingfield serves as executive director and publisher of Baptist \nNews Global.\u0014",

But what does the word uncleanness refer to? \nThat was the focus of the debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish rabbi Shammai and his school said it meant adultery. Only \nadultery was a legitimate reason for divorce. The Jewish rabbi Hillel \nand his school said that uncleanness could refer to any reason why a \nwife lost favor with her husband. It could be her cantankerous \ntemper, the fact that she talked to a stranger in the street, or that \nshe burned his bread.\u0014",

    "title": "HILLEL AND SHAMMAI SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT",
    "words": "In the first century BCE, Babylonian born Hillel (later known as \nHillel the Elder) migrated to the Land of Israel to study and worked \nas a woodcutter, eventually becoming the most influential force in \nJewish life. Hillel is said to have lived in such great poverty that \nhe was sometimes unable to pay the admission fee to study Torah, and \nbecause of him that fee was abolished. He was known for his kindness, \ngentleness, concern for humanity. One of his most famous sayings, \nrecorded in Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers, a tractate of the \nMishnah), is \"If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? And if \nI am only for myself, then what am I? And if not now, when?\" The \nHillel organization, a network of Jewish college student \norganizations, is named for him. Hillel and his descendants \nestablished academies of learning and were the leaders of the Jewish \ncommunity in the Land of Israel for several centuries. The Hillel \ndynasty ended with the death of Hillel II in 365 CE.\u0014\n\u0014\nHillel the Elders friendly adversary was Shammai, a native of the \nLand of Israel about whom little is known except that he was a \nbuilder, known for the strictness of his views. He was reputed to be \ndour, quick-tempered and impatient. Both lived during the reign of \nKing Herod (37-4 BCE), an oppressive period in Jewish history because \nof the Roman occupation of the Land of Israel. Shammai was concerned \nthat if Jews had too much contact with the Romans, the Jewish \ncommunity would be weakened, and this attitude was reflected in his \nstrict interpretation of Jewish law. Hillel did not share Shammai's \nfear and therefore was more liberal in his view of law.\u0014\n\u0014\nHillel was the more popular of the two scholars, and he was chosen by \nthe Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish court, to serve as its president. \nWhile Hillel and Shammai themselves did not differ on a great many \nbasic issues of Jewish law, their disciples were often in conflict. \nThe Talmud records over 300 differences of opinion between Beit \nHillel (the House of Hillel) and Beit Shammai (the House of Shammai). \nThe Rabbis of the Talmud generally sided with the rulings of the \nSchool of Hillel, although the Sages believed that both views were \nvalid. Sixteenth-century kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria (the Ari) said \nthat not only are both the words of the House of Shammai and the \nHouse of Hillel enduring on the conceptual level, but each has its \ntime and place on the pragmatic level as well. In our present world, \nwe follow the rulings of the House of Hillel, but in the era of \nMessiah, the majority opinion will shift in favor of the House of \nShammai, and their rulings will then be implemented. The Ari believed \nthat in our present reality, where divine commandments must be \nimposed upon an imperfect world, the rulings of the House of Hillel \nrepresent the ultimate in conformity to the divine will, while the \nrulings of the House of Shammai represent an ideal that is too lofty \nfor our present state (which is why we perceive them as stricter \nand more confining), and can only be realized on the conceptual \nlevel. In the era of Messiah, the situation will be reversed: a \nperfected world will embrace the more exacting application of Torah \nlaw expressed by the House of Shammai, while the Hillelian school of \ninterpretation will endure only conceptually.\u0014\n\u0014\nHillel's rulings were often based on concern for the welfare of the \nindividual. For example with regard to the remarriage of an aguna, \nwhose husband is not known with certainty to be alive or dead, the \nview of Hillel (and most of his colleagues) was that she can remarry \neven on the basis of indirect evidence of the husband's death. Bet \nShammai required that witnesses come forth with direct testimony \nbefore she was permitted to remarry. Another example of his leniency \nas compared with Shammai involves converts; Hillel favored the \nadmission of proselytes into Judaism even when they made unreasonable \ndemands, such as one did by demanding that the whole Torah be taught \nto him quickly \"while standing on one foot.\" Hillel accepted this \nperson as eligible for conversion, whereas Shammai dismissed him as \nnot serious about Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources: Judaism 101; Kolatch, Alfred J.

Rockefeller, Jr., Harry Emerson Fosdick's New York \nCity congregation determined to build a new church which was to be \nbeautiful beyond words. The Riverside church was the outcome.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry had agreed to lead it on three conditions:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) The only requirement for membership will be affirmation of faith \nin Christ.\u0014\n(2) The church must be interdenominational.\u0014\n(3) The church must be a very large building with a more expansive \nministry in a neighborhood crucial to the livelihood of the whole \ncity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis day, October 5, 1930, saw the celebration of the first service \nat Riverside Church, New York City. To mark the occasion, Harry wrote \nthe hymn \"God of Grace and God of Glory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod of grace and God of glory,\u0014\nOn Thy people pour Thy power.\u0014\nCrown Thine ancient church's story,\u0014\nBring her bud to glorious flower.\u0014\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage,\u0014\nFor the facing of this hour,\u0014\nFor the facing of this hour.\u0014\nAlthough some of the verses of his hymn mentioned Christ (\"Lo! the \nhosts of evil 'round us, Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways...\"), \nHarry's Christ was hardly the Jesus of Christian history, for he \ndenied the virgin birth and a literal second coming in the clouds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the Riverside church was constructed after Harry left a \nPresbyterian church in which he had ministered for many years. His \nteachings had strayed too far from his denomination's doctrine. The \nleading liberal pastor of his day, Harry flatly rejected all of the \ntenets of fundamentalism in a sermon titled \"Shall the \nFundamentalists Win?\" Early in his ministry, Harry rejected the type \nof preaching which explains the Bible verse by verse, or which traces \na topic through the Bible. Having read a book during his school days \nwhich claimed that the Bible had held back progress, Harry did not \naccept Scripture as God's infallible word.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe concluded that sermons were not to deliver or explain God's word. \nInstead, \"Every sermon should have for its main business the head-on \nconstructive meeting of some problem which was puzzling minds, \nburdening consciences, distracting lives...\" Those who attended his \nsermons were almost certain to hear him say things like, \"I would \nrather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than \nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it,\" or \"He \nwho chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to. It \nis the means that determines the end.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry had chosen his road. It was a road of the social gospel and of \nsermons that owed more to psychology than to spirituality. He wrote \nover forty books distilling his liberal views, which included \nacceptance of Darwin's evolutionary ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoincidentally, Harry died on this day, October 5, 1969, thirty-nine \nyears to the day after the dedication of his Gothic cathedral.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnker, Roy M. \"Fosdick, Harry Emerson.\" Dictionary of American \nBiography.

KATZ,\u0014\nPosted: 2008-01-29  AP\u0014\n\u0014\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Jan. 29) - It was lunchtime in one of Haiti's \nworst slums, and Charlene Dumas was eating mud.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith food prices rising, Haiti's poorest can't afford even a daily \nplate of rice, and some take desperate measures to fill their bellies.\u0014\n\u0014\nHungry people in the slums of Haiti are giving new meaning to the \nphrase \"dirt poor.\" As food prices soar, many desperate people are \neating mud cookies to stave off their hunger pangs. Here, an \n11-year-old boy named Cajeunes shows his dirt-streaked tongue after \neating a mud cookie in Cite Soleil.\u0014\nCharlene, 16 with a 1-month-old son, has come to rely on a \ntraditional Haitian remedy for hunger pangs: cookies made of dried \nyellow dirt from the country's central plateau.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mud has long been prized by pregnant women and children here as \nan antacid and source of calcium. But in places like Cite Soleil, the \noceanside slum where Charlene shares a two-room house with her baby, \nfive siblings and two unemployed parents, cookies made of dirt, salt \nand vegetable shortening have become a regular meal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When my mother does not cook anything, I have to eat them three \ntimes a day,\" Charlene said. Her baby, named Woodson, lay still \nacross her lap, looking even thinner than the slim 6 pounds 3 ounces \nhe weighed at birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough she likes their buttery, salty taste, Charlene said the \ncookies also give her stomach pains. \"When I nurse, the baby \nsometimes seems colicky too,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nFood prices around the world have spiked because of higher oil \nprices, needed for fertilizer, irrigation and transportation. Prices \nfor basic ingredients such as corn and wheat are also up sharply, and \nthe increasing global demand for biofuels is pressuring food markets \nas well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is particularly dire in the Caribbean, where island \nnations depend on imports and food prices are up 40 percent in places.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee picture of child eating dirt on MyDocuments/HungryHaitans resort \nto Eating Dirt\u0014",

    "words": "BY BRIAN BENNETT AND TESSA BERENSON\u0014\nNOVEMBER 7, 2020 1:08 PM EST   TIME MAG.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt all finally caught up to him. The lies, the outrageous boasts, the \ndisorder and disastrous management, the rants and the race-baiting, \nthe predatory instincts and compulsion to dominateall the things \nthat made President Donald Trump the ringmaster of the American \npolitical circus at last compelled a majority of voters to drive him \nout of the tent.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew other Presidents in modern history so inflamed the nation or \nexposed the cracks in our democracy as Trump. In the end, Trumps \npride didnt just precede his fall, it precipitated it. Until the \nfinal months, his campaign was managed by a novice who burned through \nmillions of dollars. Trump thought he could wish away a deadly virus. \nHe dismissed his legions of critics, preferring to bask in the \nadulation of fans. He governed as President only of his base, and he \nran for re-election without pivoting toward the center. He barely \narticulated a policy vision for a second term. He campaigned hard, \njetting to dozens of rallies on Air Force One in the final weeks of \nthe campaign, and outperforming the expectations of many thanks to a \nformidable ground game, a sophisticated campaign data operation and a \npassionate base of support.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the end, the Trump presidency ended much as it began: with a \nthin margin in key states separating two candidates in an anxious \nnation, and Trump appealing to Americas demons over its better \nangels, hurling baseless claims that hed been robbed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrumps presidency was marked by scandals and controversies as varied \nas they were alarming. He refused to face the roots of the countrys \nracial disparities and doubled down on a message of white grievance. \nOne of the dominant political trends of his tenure was the exodus of \nsuburbanites, white women, college-educated voters and independents \nfrom the Republican Party.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis prospects for re-election were dragged down by a pandemic that \nexposed his weaknesses along with ours. Chief among them was his \nreckless approach to a virus that landed him in the hospital at the \npeak of the campaign. If the President never gets COVID, he wins the \nelection. Our polling showed a significant dip when that happened, \nparticularly with suburban, college-educated, non-liberal men, says \nGOP strategist Brad Todd. Trump getting COVID sent a signal to those \npeople that his management style had consequences even for him \npersonally and was therefore unlikely to change.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresidents legacies are formed in the crucible of great challenges. \nWhen COVID-19 hit, Trump pulled open the tears in our national fabric \neven wider. Just before Election Day, as the U.S. suffered its worst \nspike in cases since the pandemic began, Trump mocked the virus as a \nmedia conspiracy. Fake News Media is going full on Covid, Covid, \nCovid, he tweeted on Oct. 27. We are rounding the turn.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe voters knew better. Over the course of an extraordinary election \nyear, more than 235,000 Americans died, and more than 9 million were \ninfected. The crisis called for a President who could be tough and \nempathetic, put forth concrete plans to deal with it and mourn with \nAmerican families who had lost loved ones in lonely hospital rooms.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrump was defeated because of his failure to connect on the thing \nthat voters most cared about, which was coronavirus, says Sarah \nLongwell, founder of Republican Voters Against Trump (RVAT). While \nlegions lost jobs, closed businesses, refrained from hugging their \naging parents and homeschooled their children, what Trump did was \ndecide to pretend like coronavirus wasnt the most dominant thing in \npeoples lives, Longwell says. His blithe dismissals may have turned \noff seniors, a core component of his fragile coalition particularly \nsusceptible to the virus: he lost 4 points among this age group \ncompared to his 2016 performance, according to CNN exit polls as of \nNov. 7.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow lasting the changes Trump has wrought for our democracy remains \nto be seen. The rifts he created will not be easy to repair. The 2020 \nelection proved there remains a strong market for the \ngrievance-fueled politics hes selling: even in defeat, Trump won \nmillions more votes than he did four years ago. It was hardly the \nabject repudiation of Trumps ideas and methods his opponents had \nenvisioned. But in the end, a majority of Americas voters made the \nchoice to move on.\u0014",

    "words": "Howe's Hymn Born as a Result of Sanitary Work\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJulia Ward Howe and her husband Samuel pitched in to help the \nSanitary Commission at the beginning of the U.S. Civil War. As a \nresult of their volunteer work, President Lincoln invited them with \nsome others to Washington. While on that trip, the Howes visited a \nUnion Army camp in Virginia and heard soldiers sing \"John Brown's \nBody,\" a song which celebrated the man who had attacked a Southern \narsenal in hope of triggering a rebellion against slavery. One line \nreads, \"John Brown's body lies a'mouldering in his grave.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Freeman Clarke, a clergyman traveling with the Howe's party, \nknew that Julia was a published poet. He urged her to write some \ndecent words to the tune. By the next day, November 19, 1861, Julia \nWard Howe had written her famous lines, the \"Battle Hymn of the \nRepublic.\" She later described how the words came to her:\u0014\n\u0014\nI awoke in the grey of the morning, and as I lay waiting for the \ndawn, the long lines of the desired poem began to entwine themselves \nin my mind, and I said to myself, \"I must get up and write these \nverses, lest I fall asleep and forget them!\" So I sprang out of bed \nand in the dimness found an old stump of a pen, which I remembered \nusing the day before. I scrawled the verses almost without looking at \nthe paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext February, Atlantic Monthly printed Mrs. Howe's poem and paid her \n$4 for it. The entire nation was inspired by the words when they \nappeared, and the song became literally the battle hymn of the \nAmerican republic during the dark days of the Civil War. When the \nsong was sung at a rally attended by President Lincoln, he cried out \nwith tears in his eyes, \"Sing it again!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, Julia Howe remained active in reform causes as \nPresident of the American Woman Suffrage Association and the American \nBranch of the Women's International Peace Association. In 1907 she \nbecame the first female member of the American Academy of Arts and \nLetters and, we regret to say, preached in Unitarian churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Julia Ward Howe died in 1910, four thousand people attended her \nfuneral at Boston's Symphony Hall. It was a moving moment when those \nfour thousand voices rang out with her song, \"The Battle Hymn of the \nRepublic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\u0014\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored\u0014\nHe has loosed the fateful lightening of his terrible, swift sword\u0014\nHis truth is marching on.\u0014\nGlory, glory, Hallelujah!

    "title": "HOW THE MAYFLOWER STORY FITS INTO NATIVE AMERICANS",
    "words": "How the Mayflower Story Fits Into Native American History\u0014\n\u0014\nBY DAVID TREUER DECEMBER 8, 2020  TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 400th anniversary of the day the Mayflower dropped anchor in \nPlymouth Harbor on Dec. 16, 1620, is the 400th anniversary of an \nAmerican beginningfor the nation as a practice, an idea, an \nexperiment. Thats true even though, for the colonists and their \ndescendants, 1620 was not much more than a blip in colonial history. \nFor Native peoplein whose communities and homelands the Puritans \narrivedthe date, and what it signifies and symbolizes, matters a \ngreat deal.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts an anniversary thats hard to celebrate. From where I stand, \n1620 wasnt a terribly good year. Many more bad years followed for my \ntribe, the Ojibwe, and our allies. I would much prefer to celebrate a \nyear like, for example, 1917. A lot was happening then, too: the \nUnited States entered the First World War; the Russian Revolution \nkicked off; the British entered Jerusalem. But a quieter, and to me \nmore profound, thing was happening in the U.S. For the first time in \ncenturies, American Indian births surged ahead of American Indian \ndeaths. We were on the rise. After centuries of theft and aggression; \nof the making and breaking of treaties; of the attempted destruction \nof Indian tribes, governments, and families; after centuries of \nassault and diminishment, we were finally beginning to rebound.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of how we got there doesnt begin with the Pilgrims landing \nat Plymouthand not just because parallel stories played out in \nVirginia and in the areas where the Spanish settled. Rather, the \nlanding and the ensuing relationship (alternately mutually \nbeneficial, antagonistic, honest, dishonest, peaceful and violent) \noffered a preview of the tempestuous 400-year-long relationship \nbetween tribes and the American Republic that followed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving anchored a while near present-day Provincetown, the Pilgrims \nmet some Native people who disappeared into the woods as the \ncolonists approached. Later, the colonists dug up some graves and \nrobbed some food caches. Continuing on, they landed in the territory \nof the Nauset. They found more graves (which they didnt disturb) and \nmore food (which they took). The Nauset attacked and the colonists \nfought back. The Nauset had reason for taking an aggressive stance \ntoward the newcomers: they and other tribes had already experienced \nwhat the English had to offer. A few years earlier, Thomas Hunt, an \nEnglishman who had come to the area to explore and trade, had \nattacked and captured 20 Nauset and Patuxet and intended to sell them \ninto slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong them was Squanto. So when the colonists landed at the abandoned \nPatuxet village where Plymouth now stands, it was empty because Hunt \nand other English had sowed disease and, as an American first act, \nenslaved the others. Nonetheless, shortly after they landed, they met \nSquantowho greeted them, in English, by saying Hello Englishmen.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the anniversary of that meeting approaches, with the story of \nPlymouth and the Mayflower still firmly ensconced in the U.S. \nnational consciousness, should we celebrate the fact that the tribes \naround Plymouth provided food and seed and technological knowledge so \nthat the colonists survived? Should we celebrate the so-called First \nThanksgiving that came the following year? Or should we celebrate the \ntreaty the colonists entered into with Massassoit of the Wampanoags, \nin which the colonists and the tribe agreed to offer one another \nmutual support in times of crisis?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould we celebrate the death of hundreds, if not thousands, of New \nEngland natives in 1631 during a particularly bad outbreak of \ndisease? Puritan minister Cotton Mather did. [A]bout this time, he \nwrote, the Indians began to be quarrelsome touching the Bounds of \nthe Land which they had sold to the English, but God ended the \nControversy by sending the Smallpox amongst the Indians. Or should \nwe remember and celebrate the death of over half of the original \ncolonists during the first six months of their tenure in America? \nThere is no record of rejoicing or of thanks being given to God by \nNative people for those deaths. Or should we celebrate the eventual \nencroachment of settlers on Native land and the resulting conflict, \nknown as King Philips War, launched by tribes in 1675 trying to \nreclaim their land?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps better to remember Plymouth as one of the starting dates for \nour ongoing American drama? All of the ingredients were there in \n1620: faith, greed, solipsism, white supremacy, hard work, endurance, \naggression, empty gestures, grave robbing, theft, goodwill and hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, 400 years after the beginning of the supposed end of Native \npeoplesbecause Plymouth has certainly been understood that waythere \nare over 5 million of us, according to the 2010 census. There are \nmore Native people in the U.S. than Jewish people, and almost twice \nas many Native people as there are those who identify as Muslim \nAmerican.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year 1620 was surely the start of a story that has become part of \nthe founding mythology of the U.S., but it was also the start of an \nAmerican Indian ordeal. The same ordeal played out across the \ncontinent in years that preceded and followed the Mayflowers \nlanding, though the Plymouth storylike all its analogueswas unique \nin its details. That ordeal has tempered us, shaped us, made us the \nmodern Natives we are: still here, yes. And still fighting for our \ntribes and our homelands and fightingon the banks of the Missouri at \nStanding Rock; in the halls of Congress as Senators; in the south \nMinneapolis streets in the weeks after George Floyds killing; in the \nwritten works of our genius; in the quiet ceremonies of our \ntraditionsfor a better, more inclusive, more thoughtful, more \npeaceful nation. Lets celebrate that.\u0014",

    "words": "Happy(?) Advent\u0014\nThe time before Christmas hasn't always been a celebration.\u0014\nTed Olsen | posted 8/08/2008 \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's pretty common to hear complaints about the difficulty of keeping \nthe joy of the Christmas season. Or, more commonly, we hear people \ntalking about how this time of year is (as Andy Williams puts it) \n\"the hap-happiest season of all.\" The world seems so festive and \ncelebratory this month that we would never dream of complaining about \nitafter all, doesn't the world take note of Jesus at this time more \nthan any?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern arguments aside, the time before Christmas hasn't always been \na celebration. Like the Lenten season before Easter, Advent was once \na solemn preparation for Christmas. Actually, not Christmas exactly. \nOriginally it was a season preparing for Epiphany, January 6which \ncommemorates not Jesus' birth, but his adoration by the Magi (in the \nWest) or his baptism in the Jordan River (in the East). Some people \nclaim Advent was first celebrated by the apostle Peter, but the exact \nstarting date of the season has been lost to history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever it started, Advent originally was a time of fasting and \nself-reflection (instead of today's Christmas parties and \"thinking \nabout other people for a change.\") In the mid-300s, two events \nchanged that thinking: Constantine the Great built the Church of the \nNativity in Bethlehem, declaring Jesus' birthday a national holiday; \nand Julius, bishop of Rome, set the date as December 25. Christmas \ntook on a happier, more celebratory feel and became a time of joyous \nanticipation. (By the mid-400s, even the Eastern churchwith a few \nexceptionsrecognized December 25 as Christmas. However, Advent is \nstill a much more solemn occasion among Orthodox Christians, and the \nseason begins much earlierNovember 15 instead of the Sunday nearest \nNovember 30.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Western church no longer required fasting during \nAdvent, though more liturgical churches still encourage solemnity and \ndiscourage festivities. For the church, purple (and blue), not red \nand green, are this season's colors. Over time, Advent also became an \noccasion to prepare for Christ's second coming as well as to reflect \non his firstwhich worked great for us at the magazine as we prepared \nan issue on the Second Coming (issue 61).\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope I don't sound like a wet blanket. We at the magazine are \n\"historically incorrect\" too, with Christmas decorations around the \noffice, carols playing softly in the background, and Christmas \nparties.

    "words": "Jeremiah Rankin: How Can Christians Say Goodbye?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Christians part from one another, especially if it is expected \nto be a long separation, they may sing the hymn \"God Be with You till \nWe Meet Again.\" Jeremiah Rankin wrote that song.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, January 2, 1828, Rankin wasn't thinking about leaving to \ngo anywhere. On the contrary, he had just emerged into the world. He \nwas born in Thornton, New Hampshire.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch work attracted Rankin. He trained for the ministry at Andover \nTheological Seminary. After his ordination, he pastored churches up \nand down the east coast, churning out singsong religious verse. You \ncouldn't call it religious poetry without doing injustice to the real \nthing: Spenser, Donne, Tennyson.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"THE WORD of God to Leyden came,\u0014\nDutch town by Zuyder-Zee;\u0014\nRise up, my children of no name,\u0014\nMy kings and priests to be...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Rankin also wrote the fine hymn \"God Be with You till We Meet \nAgain.\" You'd think a song like that had a special story behind it--a \nbeautiful daughter sailing to India, a friend dying of yellow fever. \nBut no. Rankin said he just wanted something the church could sing \nwhen service was breaking up for the week. He got the idea for the \nfirst stanza of the song when the dictionary told him that \"good-bye\" \nwas short for \"God be with you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God be with you till we meet again,\u0014\nBy His counsels guide, uphold you,\u0014\nWith His sheep securely fold you;\u0014\nGod be with you till we meet again.\"\u0014\nRankin was a Congregationalist but he sent the words to the Methodist \norganist, William G. Tomer, who wrote the tune. However, it was Ira \nB. Sankey, Moody's song evangelist, who really popularized the song, \nsinging it on both sides of the Atlantic.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah Rankin also wrote \"Tell it to Jesus,\" which is almost as \npopular as \"God Be with You.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1889 the hymn-writing preacher became president of Howard College \nin Washington, DC, a school originally founded as a seminary after \nthe Civil War to educate African-Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah.

    "title": "HUMBLE QUEEN BATHILDE",
    "words": "Humble Queen Bathilde\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWith quick fingers, the slave girl undid her hair from its long, \nflaxen braids. In moments, it looked as if it had never felt a comb. \nHastily stripping off the attractive clothes she had worn while she \nattended noble ladies, she slipped into rags. When she had daubed her \nface with kitchen grime, her disguise was complete. From a beautiful \nlady's maid she had transformed herself into a dirty kitchen hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nBathilde was trying to escape marriage. Archimbold, mayor of the \npalace of the kings of France had announced he was going to take her \nas his wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptured by Danish raiders and sold as a slave in France, the \nAnglo-Saxon captive, Bathilde served as a slave to the mayor's wife. \nWhen his wife died, he turned his eyes on modest and beautiful \nBathilde, who had always shown herself cheerful and attentive to the \nneeds of others. What her original name was, we do not know, for \nBathilde means \"Maiden of the female apartment.\" We would call her a \nmaid in waiting. Archimbold learned to trust this Christian girl and \nmade her his cupbearer.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow Bathilde was having nothing to do with Archimbold's marriage \nscheme. Hiding behind her disguise, she escaped the Mayor's \nattention. Thinking she had run away, Archimbold married another \nwoman. Then Bathilde breathed a sigh of relief. She scrubbed her \nface, changed her clothes and braided her hair. The sunny beauty of \nformer days was back again.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Clovis II noticed her. He asked for her hand in marriage. This \ntime Bathilde did not hide. In 649, the nineteen-year-old girl became \nqueen of France. This sudden rise to giddy heights did not rush to \nher head. Remembering her own trials as a slave, she continued in her \npattern of serving others. She exerted all her energies to assist the \npoor and she encouraged Clovis to do good.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years and three sons later, Clovis died. Bathilde became regent \nof France. Free to do the good she would, she studied the problem of \nslavery and determined to outlaw it. One of her actions was to reduce \nthe high taxes which forced poor families to sell children. Although \nshe did not outlaw existing slaves, she made it illegal to buy or \nsell a slave in France; and she passed a law that any slave who was \nbrought into the country immediately became free.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, she hunted for children who had been sold into slavery, \nbought them and set them free.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to this, Bathilde set out to improve French land. The \nbest way to do this was to take unattached men and set them to \ncultivating wild lands and praying. Consequently, she founded a \nnumber of monasteries and these transformed the ruins of France.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs soon as Bathilde's oldest son was of age, she retired to an abbey \nwhere she served out the remainder of her life, waiting on others as \nshe had always done. Tradition says she died on this day, January 30, \n680. A humble slave, a gracious and far-seeing queen, France has good \nreason to honor this English-born woman. Pope Nicholas I canonized \nher as a saint.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, Sabine. Lives of the Saints. Edinburgh: John Grant, \n1914.\u0014",

Though nine of his illegitimate children survived \nhim, neither of his legitimate children did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam was part of the first generation to grow to maturity under \nthe Royal Marriages Act of 1772, which forbade descendants of George \nII from marrying unless they obtained the monarch's consent, or, if \nover the age of 25, alternatively giving 12 months' notice to the \nPrivy Council.

Harriet vowed to write \nsomething. The result was Uncle Tom's Cabin. An international \nbestseller, it was adored by abolitionists but vilified by the South. \nIt so enflamed popular opinion that when she met Abraham Lincoln \nduring the war between the states he said, \"So this is the little \nlady who made this big war!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was born in Litchfield, Connecticut on this day June 14, \n1811, the sixth child of Lyman Beecher, an ardent Calvinist and \nPuritan. \"Wisht it had been a boy,\" remarked Lyman. Although he doted \non his daughters, he desired sons who could become preachers and \nsoul-winners. The fifth Beecher child had also been named Harriet, \nbut had died of whooping cough a few weeks after birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was often morbid while growing up as she struggled with \nissues of faith. But when she was fourteen, she cried to her father \nthat she had given herself to Christ. Later in her marriage to Calvin \nStowe, she would plead with him to seek Christ with the same burning \ndevotion with which he sought knowledge. \"If you had studied Christ \nwith half the energy that you have studied Luther ... then would he \nbe formed in you ... \" When he turned to spiritualism, she pleaded \nwith him, the biblical scholar, that it was unbiblical.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Harriet wrote many other books and stories, Uncle Tom's \nCabin is her best. Blacks are shown as fully human and, more \nimportantly, as created in the image of Christ. Many of the \ncharacters, such as Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, Eva and Topsy are vivid \nand memorable. Eliza, crossing the Ohio river by leaping from chunk \nto chunk of ice, is an unforgettable picture and is based on the true \naccount of a desperate fugitive.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics were harsh. When one of Harriet's children died, some said \nGod had taken the babe to keep Harriet from growing vain over her \nsuccess. She replied, \"I wrote what I did because as a woman, as a \nmother, I was oppressed & brokenhearted, with the sorrows & injustice \nI saw, because as a Christian I felt the dishonor to \nChristianity--because as a lover of my country I trembled at the \ncoming day of wrath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was always in financial difficulty. Neither she nor Calvin \nunderstood money management. After her literary success, they built \nan expensive house which turned into a money pit. Bad investments \ngobbled up thousands more dollars. The Stowes also suffered in other \nways. Calvin was a hypochondriac. A rapid succession of children left \nHarriet weak. One son predeceased the parents. Another became an \nalcoholic and disappeared from sight. Harriet also was loudly berated \nfor her defense of Lady Byron. Her last ten years she lived in a \nnever-never world, no longer fixed to reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, John. One Hundred Great Lives.

    "title": "HOW WOULD YOU SUMMARIZE THE O.T. IN 2,000 WORDS",
    "words": "How Would You Summarize the Old Testament in 2,000 Words?\u0014\nJUSTIN TAYLOR  |  JULY 5, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his commentary on the book of Hebrews for the Evangelical Biblical \nTheology Commentary published by Lexham, Tom Schreiner provides a \ngood summary of the entire Old Testament storyline, reprinted below \nwith permission. [Ive added headings.]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scriptures open in Genesis with God as the sovereign King \ncreating the world and everything in it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdam and Eve\u0014\n\u0014\nHuman beings are made in the image of God and appointed to rule the \nworld for God (Gen 1:2627). They are mandated to rule the world \nunder Gods lordship and for his glory.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of trusting and obeying God, Adam and Eve defied him and \nrefused to submit to him (Genesis 3). Because of their transgression \nincited by the words of the serpent, they were spiritually separated \nfrom God and introduced death into the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, death is not the final word, for God promises that the \noffspring of the woman will crush the serpent (Gen 3:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe initial optimism engendered by the promise collapses, for human \nbeings are radically evil. Cain was the offspring of the serpent and \nmurdered Abel. (All the offspring of Adam and Eve come into the world \nas the offspring of the serpent, and hence those who belong to God \nare the recipients of his grace.) The offspring of the serpent were \ntriumphing over the offspring of the woman, though God granted Seth \nto Adam and Eve to continue the lineage through which the promise \nwould be fulfilled (Gen 4:25).\u0014\n\u0014\nNoah\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause the corruption was so great, because the offspring of the \nserpent were spreading so rapidly, God had to destroy them with the \nflood, showing that he rules and reigns even when evil seems to have \nthe upper hand. God established a covenant with Noah, pledging to \npreserve the world until he accomplished redemption (Genesis 69).\u0014\n\u0014\nTower of Babel\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the story of the tower of Babel reveals that human beings had \nnot changed (Gen 11:19); they were still inclined toward evil and \nlived to make a name for themselves instead of living for the glory \nand honor and praise of the one true God.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis 111 unveils the depth of human evil so that readers will \ngrasp that victory over the serpent is a massive undertaking. The \nevil in human beings is no trivial matter. A demonic rejection of God \nand an embrace of evil afflict human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite human evil, which defies the imagination, God is gracious. He \nchose one man through whom he would fulfill the promise made to the \nwoman. He promises Abraham that he will have:\u0014\n\u0014\nland (Canaan),\u0014\noffspring (Isaac), and\u0014\nuniversal blessing (Gen 12:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nStill the story rolls on slowly. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob never \npossessed the land, and Abraham found it agonizingly difficult to \nhave even one child! The Lord teaches him through the birth of Isaac \nthat the promise will only be fulfilled through God himself, that \nhuman beings cant contribute to the promises fulfillment.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac and Jacob learned the same lesson so that, when Genesis ends, \nIsrael was in the wrong land (Egypt), there were only about 70 \nIsraelites (when God promised they would be as many as the stars of \nthe sky), and there was certainly not universal blessing. What is \nsaid here could be misunderstood, for there could scarcely be \ncountless descendants in three generations, and Joseph as Pharaohs \nright-hand man did bless the nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nExodus\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Exodus opens, the promise of offspring for Israel is being \nfulfilled, for their population was exploding, which terrified the \nEgyptians. The Lord intended to show Israel again and again that \nsalvation is his work, not theirs. Hence, he freed Israel from Egypt \nthrough Moses with great signs and wonders (Exodus 118). The Lord \ncrushed the offspring of the serpent (Pharaoh), who attempted to \nannihilate the people from whom the offspring of the woman would come \n(Gen 3:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nCovenant with Israel\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael recognized that the Lord had redeemed them, fulfilling his \npromise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Israel was adopted as Gods son \n(Exod 4:22), becoming his special possession and a kingdom of priests \nif they followed the Lords instructions (Exod 19:56). The \nredemption from Egypt becomes a type and anticipation of the \nredemption that would be accomplished in Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord entered into a covenant with Israel, choosing them as his \nspecial people (cf. Exodus 1924). If Israel obeyed the covenant \nstipulations, they would be blessed; but if they transgressed what \nthe Lord commanded, they would experience the curses of the covenant \n(Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 2628). The Lord didnt demand perfection \nto remain in the covenant, for sacrifices were instituted to grant \nforgiveness for Israels transgressions (Leviticus 17, 16).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord also impressed on Israel his holiness. He dwelt with his \npeople in the tabernacle (Exodus 2540), but those who treated the \nLord with contempt would be destroyed (Leviticus 10), as the \nthunderstorm which gripped Mount Sinai clearly taught the people.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, the old covenant was a failure. The sacrifices didnt \ncleanse the conscience of sin and provide free access to God, nor did \nthe old covenant inscribe the law on the heart. But we are getting \nahead of the story here!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Land of Canaan\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next element of the promise of Abraham was ready to be fulfilled. \nIsrael was about to take possession of Canaan. We read in Numbers how \nthe people failed to follow the Lords instructions. After seeing the \nLords signs and wonders that routed the Egyptians, Israel, amazingly \nenough, didnt believe the Lord could bring them into the land, and \nhence they disobeyed his instructions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story wasnt over, however, for under Joshua Israel possessed the \nland of Canaan, though the story clarifies that they didnt possess \nthe entirety of the land. Israels triumphs are the Lords work, for \nthey win impossible victories over foes that are far stronger than \nthey are. Joshua concludes by saying that the Lord has given rest to \nIsrael (21:4; 22:4; 23:1). The rest under Joshua was a type and \nanticipation of a greater rest to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudges\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon opening Judges, we might think that paradise is around the \ncorner. Two elements of the promise to Abraham are fulfilled: Israel\u0014\nhad a large population and now inhabited the land of Canaan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of years had passed since the promise was made to Abraham, \nbut Israel now seemed to be on the cusp of blessing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is rather stunning to see where the story goes next. Instead of \nmoving forward, Israel slipped backward. They were in that sense like \nAdam in paradise. Instead of trusting and obeying the Lord, they \nturned toward idols so that the Lord unleashed their enemies upon \nthem. Israel repeated a cycle of sin, defeat before enemies, \nrepentance, and deliverance. Judges concludes with a story that \nechoes what happened to Lot in Sodom (Judges 20; Genesis 19). Israel \nwas in the land, but they were not submitting to Yahwehs lordship. \nInstead of blessing the nations, they were being corrupted by the \nnations.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Saul\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen 1 Samuel opens, Israel had a corrupt priesthood and was \nteetering toward collapse. Still the Lord was gracious, raising up \nSamuel to bring the nation back to him. The kingship was instituted \nunder Samuel when Saul was installed as the first king.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we read perceptively, the theme of kingship is actually in the \nnarrative from the beginning. The Lord promises that kings will come \nfrom Abraham and Jacob (17:6, 16; 35:11). Indeed, the scepter will \nbelong to Judah, and the peoples of the world (universal blessing!) \nwill obey him (Gen 49:10). Balaam prophesies that a star and scepter \nfrom Israel will crush (cf. Gen 3:15) the enemies of the Lord (Num \n24:1719). The offspring of the woman who will destroy the serpent \nwill come from a king in Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe narrative poses an implicit question: is Saul that king? On first \ntaking the reins of power, it looked as if he might be. But Saul \nturned out like Adam in the garden and like Israel after possessing \nCanaan. Instead of trusting and obeying the Lord, he followed his own \ndesires, and hence the Lord pledges that there will not be a Saulide \ndynasty.\u0014\n\u0014\nCovenant with King David\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid was anointed as king instead of Saul, and Saul became Davids \nmortal enemy, following the footsteps of Pharaoh (the offspring of \nthe serpent!) who tried to destroy the chosen of the Lord. David was \npersecuted and on the run, but he trusted in the Lord to exalt him \ninstead of wresting the kingdom from Saul. Finally, the Philistines \nkilled Saul in battle, and David as king reigned over all Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavids kingship was marked by his trust and obedience to the Lord. \nIndeed, the Lord made a covenant with David that is central to the \nscriptural story line. The offspring of the woman who would triumph \nover the serpent would come from Davids line. He would be a Davidic \nking, for the Lord promised David a perpetual dynasty (2 Samuel 7). \nThis promise finds its fulfillment in Jesus the Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite all of Davids virtues, he was not the one who would crush \nthe serpent, for he too was a sinner needing forgiveness since he \nviolated the covenant with the Lord by committing adultery with \nBathsheba and murdering Uriah (2 Samuel 11).\u0014\n\u0014\nSolomon\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, when Davids son Solomon ascended to the throne, it seemed \nthat paradise was around the corner. Israel was at peace. Solomon was \na wise and judicious king, and a marvelous temple was erected to \nworship the Lord. Could universal blessing be far behind?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Solomon recapitulated the story we have seen over and over again. \nHe followed the pattern of Adam in the garden, Israel in Canaan, and \nSaul as king. He ceased to trust in the Lord and turned to idols.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivided Kingdom\u0014\n\u0014\nThe kingdom, after Solomons day and as a result of his sin, was \ndivided between the north and the south, with Israel in the north and \nJudah in the south.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery single king in Israel followed the pattern of the first king, \nJeroboam son of Nebat, and worshiped idols. The kings of Judah had a \nmore mixed record, for some were faithful to the Lord, though even \nthe best of them failed to do all the Lord commanded.\u0014\n\u0014\nExile\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the day, though, both Israel and Judah gave themselves \nover to sin, and thus both kingdoms experienced the curses of the \ncovenant:\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael was exiled to Assyria in 722 BC and Judah was exile to Babylon \nin 586 BC.\u0014\nThe new covenant is better than the old. Such a judgment is verified \nby the history of Israel. The kingdom was not realized through the \nold covenant since both Israel and Judah did not and could not keep \nthe prescriptions of the covenant.\u0014\n\u0014\nProphets\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophets came to center stage after the kingdom was instituted in \nIsrael, warning both Israel and Judah that exile would come unless \nthey repented and turned to the Lord. The Day of the Lord will come, \nand it will not be a day of salvation but a day of judgment for \ndisobedient Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophets, however, did not only proclaim a message of judgment. \nIsrael would go into exile, but there would be a new exodus. Israel, \nby the grace of God, would return to the land. There would be a new \nstart for the people of God, and the kingdom would come with the \narrival of the new exodus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that is not all. There will be a new covenant (Jer 31:3134; Ezek \n36:2627) in which Israels sins will be finally and fully forgiven. \nThe Lord will write the law on Israels heart by giving them the Holy \nSpirit, and so they will desire to do what the Lord says. The Lord \nwill pour out his Spirit on his people, and a new age of salvation \nwill arise (cf. Isa 32:15; 44:3; Joel 2:28). Creation will be \nrenewed, and there will be a new exodus, a new covenant, and a new \ncreation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe kingdom God promised has not been withdrawn. It will come, and a \nnew David will reign on the throne (Hos 3:5; Mic 5:24; Isa 9:17; \n11:110; 55:3; Jer 23:56; 30:9; 33:1517; Ezek 34:2324; 37:2425; \nZech 9:9). The new creation, the new exodus, and the new covenant \nwill be fulfilled through a king! The serpent will be defeated, and \nthe kingdom will come.\u0014\n\u0014\nReturn from Exile\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael returned from exile in 536 BC, and yet the promises of a new \ncovenant, a new creation, and the coming kingdom were not realized. \nIt seems that the prophecies found in the prophets only had an \nalready-but-not-yet fulfillment. Remarkably Israel, by and large, did \nnot surrender their faith. They continued to believe that the Lord \nwould fulfill his promises to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchreiner goes on to provide a brief summary of the culmination of \nthis story in the Gospels and the book of Acts:\u0014\n\u0014\nGospels\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the NT opens, there are a variety of opinions and sects in \nIsrael, but there was a common belief that the Lord would keep his \nkingdom promises. Most believed that the great promises would be \nrealized only if Israel was obedient to the Torah. The events in the \nGospels took place before Hebrews was written and hence are part of \nthe theological backdrop of the letter. We can hardly do justice to \nthe message of the Gospels here, but certain themes stand out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, Jesus is the new David promised by the prophets. He is the one \nthrough whom the blessing promised to Abraham and David would be \nfulfilled.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, Jesus teaches that the kingdom has arrived in his ministry. \nThe kingdom has come because the king has come!\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, Jesus clearly teaches that he is the one who will give the \nSpirit to his people (cf. Matt 3:1112 par.; John 1416); the \npromises of return from exile, a new covenant, and a new creation \nwould come to pass through Gods Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, Jesus is the Son of Man who will receive the kingdom (cf. Dan \n7:914). He is the Son of God who is Immanuel, God with us (Matt \n1:23). He is the Word of God (John 1:118) who is fully divine (cf. \nJohn 5:23). He existed before Abraham was born (John 8:58). He is the \nBread of the Life, the Light of the World, the Good Shepherd, the \nResurrection and the Life, the Way and the Truth and the Life, and \nthe True Vine.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, at the Last Supper Jesus teaches that the new covenant is \ninstituted with his death (Matt 26:2629 par.). Jesus is the Servant \nof the Lord (cf. Isaiah 53) who took upon himself the sins of his \npeople. The Gospels have been called passion narratives with an \nextended introduction, for the climax of the story comes with Jesus \ndeath and resurrection, and all the Gospels teach that through Jesus \ndeath and resurrection forgiveness is granted (e.g., Matt 1:21; \n20:28; Mark 10:45; Luke 22:1920; John 1:29; 6:51; 11:4952).\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch more could be said. What is striking in the story of the Gospels \nis that the people of Israel, except for a few disciples, failed to \nsee what was right before their eyes. The problem that plagued Israel \nthroughout its history still persisted. They continued to resist \nGods revelation. Jesus wasnt embraced as Israels deliverer. He was \ndespised as a messianic pretender, especially since they thought his \nteaching didnt accord with the law. Hence, instead of crowning Jesus \nas the king, they crucified him on the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey didnt realize that Jesus was the Passover Lamb, the Son of Man, \nthe Son of God, the Word of God, and the Servant of the Lord of \nIsaiah 53.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey didnt understand that through Jesus death on the cross the new \ncovenant was instituted as he taught at the Last Supper.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey didnt realize that the forgiveness that the new covenant \npromised (Jer 31:34) was accomplished through Jesus death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeath was not the end of the story. God vindicated Jesus by raising \nhim from the dead. The resurrection (Isa 26:19; Ezekiel 37; Dan 12:2) \nsignaled the arrival of the new creation and age to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Jesus the return from exile (which is the coming of the kingdom) \nhad arrived, though it wont be consummated until the second coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new covenant was inaugurated with his death and the gift of the \nSpirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new creation had come with his resurrection, and he was most \ncertainly the new David.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophecies of the OT were all fulfilled in him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet there was a proviso. The new creation, the new covenant, and \nthe new exodus were inaugurated but not consummated. The kingdom had \ncome but not in its fullness. All nations would be blessed through \nhim, so that there was an opportunity for salvation for all peoples \nbefore the final day.\u0014\n\u0014\nActs\u0014\n\u0014\nWe see in the Acts of the Apostles the gift of the Holy Spirit given \nto the church (Acts 2), signaling that the eschaton had arrived. The \nnew covenant is the age of the Holy Spirit, which came at Pentecost. \nIn Acts the good news about Jesus Christ is proclaimed to both Jews \nand Gentiles, so that the promise given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob \nof worldwide blessing began to be realized.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: a conservative interpretation of many issues in this discussion.\u0014",

    "words": "Bruno Bettelheim (August 28, 1903  March 13, 1990) was an \nAustrian-born psychologist, scholar, public intellectual and author \nwho spent most of his academic and clinical career in the United \nStates. An early writer on autism, Bettelheim's work focused on the \neducation of emotionally disturbed children, as well as Freudian \npsychology more generally. In the U.S., he later gained a position as \nprofessor at the University of Chicago and director of the Sonia \nShankman Orthogenic School for Disturbed Children, and after 1973 \ntaught at Stanford University.\u0014\n\u0014\nBettelheim's ideas, which grew out of those of Sigmund Freud, \ntheorized that children with behavioral and emotional disorders were \nnot born that way, and could be treated through extended \npsychoanalytic therapy, treatment that rejected the use of \npsychotropic drugs and shock therapy.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s \nhe had an international reputation in such fields as autism, child \npsychiatry, and psychoanalysis.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of his work was discredited after his death due to fraudulent \nacademic credentials, allegations of abusive treatment of patients \nunder his care, accusations of plagiarism, and lack of oversight by \ninstitutions and the psychological community.\u0014\n\u0014\nBettelheim was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on August 28, 1903. \nWhen his father died, Bettelheim left his studies at the University \nof Vienna to look after his family's sawmill. Having discharged his \nobligations to his family's business, Bettelheim returned as a mature \nstudent in his thirties to the University of Vienna.[citation needed] \nSources disagree about his education (see section Misrepresented \ncredentials).\u0014\n\u0014\nBettelheim's first wife, Gina, took care of a troubled American \nchild, Patsy, who lived in their home in Vienna for seven years, and \nwho may or may not have been on the autism spectrum.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Austrian academic culture of Bettelheim's time, one could not \nstudy the history of art without mastering aspects of \npsychology.[citation needed] Candidates for the doctoral dissertation \nin the History of Art in 1938 at Vienna University had to fulfill \nprerequisites in the formal study of the role of Jungian archetypes \nin art, and in art as an expression of the unconscious.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Jewish by birth, Bettelheim grew up in a secular family. After \nthe Nazi invasion and Anschluss (political annexation) of Austria on \nMarch 12, 1938, the Nazi authorities sent Bettelheim, other Austrian \nJews and political opponents to the Dachau and Buchenwald \nconcentration camps where they were brutally treated, and tortured or \nkilled. Bettelheim was arrested on May 28, 1938 and was imprisoned in \nboth these camps for ten and half months before being released on \nApril 14, 1939. While at the Buchenwald camp, he met and befriended \nthe social psychologist Ernst Federn. As a result of an amnesty \ndeclared for Adolf Hitler's birthday (which occurred slightly later \non April 20, 1939), Bettelheim and hundreds of other prisoners were \nreleased. Bettelheim drew on the experience of the concentration \ncamps for some of his later work.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of his life, Bettelheim suffered from depression. He \nappeared to have had difficulties with depression for much of his \nlife.[20] In 1990, widowed, in failing physical health, and suffering \nfrom the effects of a stroke which impaired his mental abilities and \nparalyzed part of his body, he died by suicide as a result of \nself-induced asphyxiation by placing a plastic bag over his \nhead.[21][22] He died on March 13, 1990, in Maryland.\u0014",

    "words": "Helen Montgomery Changed our Bibles' Look\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Helen Barrett Montgomery set out to make her translation of the \nNew Testament, her goal was not to show off or to prove what a woman \ncould do. It was evangelistic. She had found that the boys in her \nSunday school class did not understand the King James Version. She \ntried a translation by Weymouth and the boys understood that better, \nso she decided to do her own and \"make it plain\" for the sake of \nyoung people, busy Sunday-school teachers, and foreigners. The New \nYork Bible Society issued it in 1924 on its one hundredth \nanniversary, so it became known as the Centenary Translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelen was the first woman to translate the New Testament from Greek \nto English. More importantly, she seems to have been the first to put \ntitles on chapters and sections of the Bible--something most versions \ndo now. She also put the verse numbers in the margins so that the \nsections would read like ordinary paragraphs. These innovations made \nthe Scripture more readable.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author of the Centenary Translation was born in Kingsville, Ohio \non this day July 31, 1861. Both of her parents were teachers. Her \nfather, however, wanted to become a minister. Much of Helen's life \nwas spent in New York, as a consequence, because he moved to \nRochester when she was young so that he could study for the ministry \nat the Rochester Theological Seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelen attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She placed first \nin her Greek class, and also became a researcher and writer of \nconsiderable talent, writing eight books on missions during her life, \nincluding Following the Sunrise: A Century of Baptist Missions, \n1813-1913. She must have shown leadership abilities, too, for the \nNorthern Baptist Convention later made her their presiding officer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter graduation, Helen became a teacher. She married businessman \nWilliam A. Montgomery in 1887. (His company later become the \nRochester Products Division of General Motors.) She taught at the \nLake Avenue church for 42 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelen was a close friend of Susan B. Anthony and, like her, promoted \nwomen's suffrage, not to mention social and educational reform. She \nread some of her feminist ideals into her Bible translation or added \nit to the notes. What is more, she became the first female minister \nin her denomination, as an assistant pastor of Lake Avenue Baptist \nChurch in Rochester, New York, where her father had pastored until \nhis death about three years before. As if that wasn't enough, she was \nalso the first woman elected to public office in Rochester, thanks in \npart to women's work she had done with Anthony.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs she grew older, Helen's interest in missions increased. She served \nas president of the Woman's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society \nfrom 1914 to 1924. She especially urged prayer for missions. Helen \ndied in 1934, but her good work went on, for her will left more than \n$450,000 (worth probably twenty times as much today) to colleges, \nchurches, missions and hospitals.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDowd, Sharyn. \"Helen Barrett Montgomery's Centenary Translation of \nthe New Testament; characteristics and influences.\" \nhttp://www.godswordtowomen.org/sharyn_dowd.htm\u0014\n\"Helen Barrett Montgomery.\" \nhttp://winningthevote.org/HBMontgomery.html\u0014",

    "title": "HENRY IV RENOUNCES PROTESTANT FAITH",
    "words": "Henry IV Renounced Protestant Faith\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry IV \"The Great\" remains the most popular of the French kings. \nHowever, there was time when it was doubtful he could take the \nthrone. The chief difficulty lay in the fact that he had been reared \na Protestant (French Huguenot) in a nation whose majority was Roman \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry escaped the St Bartholomew Day massacre (in which Catholics \nbutchered several thousand Protestants) by renouncing Protestantism. \nHeld captive by the French royal family, he escaped, rejoined the \nProtestants and led them to successful victories. Meanwhile, deaths \nmade him legal heir to the French throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the pope had excommunicated Henry for his religious views. \nFrench Catholics might have appreciated his flair, but were unwilling \nto see a \"heretic\" on the throne. The Catholic league had even passed \na law that barred Henry from the throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nModerate Catholics, recognizing that Henry was the only person with a \nreal hope of governing the war-torn country urged him to renounce his \nchildhood faith and become a Catholic. Henry replied that one's \nreligion was not as easily changed as ones shirt. Nonetheless, he \ntalked with his advisors, and they assured him that one could be \nsaved as truly in the Roman Church as under the Calvinism in which he \nhad grown up.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour and a half years passed between the day the throne became vacant \nand Henry's announcement that he would convert to Catholicism. In \nJuly 1593, he made his way to Saint-Denis to speak with a score of \nCatholic bishops and theologians who helped him resolve his remaining \nquestions. His last objections removed, Henry abjured Protestantism \non this day, July 25, 1593.\u0014\n\u0014\nDressed in white satin, the heir to the throne marched through the \nhot streets of Saint-Denis, accompanied by trumpeters, a Swiss guard \nand many nobles. The crowds shouted \"vive le roi!\" as he passed. At \nthe basilica of Saint-Denis, an archbishop met him and heard him ask \nto be received into the communion of the catholic, apostolic Roman \nChurch.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Do you truly desire it?\" asked the archbishop.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, I wish and desire it,\" said Henry. Popular legend also has him \nsay at some point, \"Paris is worth a mass.\" This is probably fiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Henry's problems were not over. The pope wanted to make an \nexample of him and refused to remove his excommunication without \nhumiliating penances. However, political dangers and King Henry VIII \nof England's break with the Catholic church, brought the pope to a \nmore reasonable attitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Henry became king, he issued the Edict of Nantes, protecting the \nrights of his former Protestant allies. He adopted policies which for \nthe most part brought peace and prosperity to France. The chief blot \non his character was his passion for mistresses. He was assassinated \nby a dagger-wielding fanatic seventeen years after his famous \nabjuration.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBuisseret, David. Henry IV.

Herzog's Huge Church Encyclopedia\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL     2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of a church-historian's valuable resources is the Schaff-Herzog \nEncyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. John Jacob Herzog--the Herzog of \nthe encyclopedia title--was born on this day, September 12, 1805, \nprobably in Basel, Switzerland. The Herzog family had recently moved \nthere from Wurtemburg.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was left an orphan at a young age and relatives raised him. He \nshowed himself an apt pupil of the sciences and then of theology, \nstudying with such notable individuals as the mathematician Christoph \nBernoulli and with theologians Schleiermacher and Neander. He became \nan educator at Lausanne, specializing in historical theology. John \nissued works on several of the major reformers, including Zwingli, \nCalvin and Ocolampadius.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian thought often needs defenders because scholarly and \npseudo-scholarly attacks never cease. John stood for the faith \nagainst damaging influences, including attempts to rewrite Christ's \nlife so as to rob Him of his deity. When Plymouth Brethren began \nspreading their message in Germany, John opposed them because he \nconsidered their teaching as too individualistic for the good of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the government made demands that overstepped the bounds of \nchurch and state, John refused to go along. He resigned his position \nat Lausanne and worked as a private scholar for much of 1846 and \n1847. He was glad to accept an invitation to teach at Halle, because \nhe had had little to live on during the previous months. At Halle, he \ndeveloped a close relationship with the well-known Protestant \ntheologian Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same year that John resigned his job at Lausanne, Roman Catholic \nscholars issued the first volume of the Catholic Encyclopedia. \nProtestants immediately felt the need to produce an encyclopedia of \ntheir own to counterbalance the Catholic version. Political troubles \nslowed down the project and its editor died. Tholuck recommended \nHerzog for the vacant position.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was liked by all parties--in part because of his generous \ntreatment of Reformation figures. He got the job. His vast knowledge \nof church history made him the perfect editor. In fact, he wrote 500 \nof the articles that appeared in the first edition. Later, he was \nco-editor of a second edition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Schaff was well-acquainted with John, who asked him to adapt \nthe encyclopedia for American use. Schaff agreed to undertake the \nhuge project. And that is how we got the famous and useful \nSchaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge.

    "title": "HEBREWS, A DANGEROUS BOOK FOR JEWS",
    "words": "Hebrews, the New Testaments most dangerous book for Jews\u0014\n\u0014\nReading and preaching Hebrews without supersessionism\u0014\nby Jesper Svartvik  September 13, 2021  Christian Century\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1993, as a visiting research student at the Hebrew University in \nJerusalem, I read for the first time a passage in the rabbinical text \nMidrash Tanchuma, a text that has influenced me profoundly. The \npassage begins with a discussion of the differences between the \nwritten Torah (the five books of Moses or, in a wider sense, the \nentire Hebrew Bible) and the oral Torah (Jewish oral traditions). \nThen follows a Midrash, in which it is suggested that Moses also \nwanted the Mishnah (the oldest part of the oral Torah) in writing. \nHowever, God said no, because God foresaw that the peoples of the \nworld were going to translate the Torah and read it in Greek, and \nthen they would say: Anu hen Yisrael (We are Israel). God therefore \nwanted the Mishnah to be a secret, because there are those who will \nuse the Jewish scriptures as a theological weapon aimed at the Jewish \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is clearly a reference to the claim of the Christian movement. \nIndeed, numerous Christians take for granted that this is the \nsingular Christian positionthat is, that Christians must claim that \nthey are the true Israel or the new Israel or simply Israel, at \nthe expense of the Jewish people. Jews have been targeted by numerous \nanti-Jewish ideologies throughout the ages, but only Christendom has \nclaimed that it has replaced Israel, that Hebrew Bible texts actually \nare about Christians, and that they can only be read with Christian \nglasses. At the time of Augustine (354430), it was not controversial \nto invert the distribution of roles in the Bible. Hence, he read the \nwords in Psalm 59:11Slay them not, lest my people forgetas an \ninstruction about how the church (my people) should treat Jews \n(them). In other words, the church fathers developed a hermeneutics \nthat decentered and even disinherited Jews and Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne New Testament text has done more than any other to cement the \nnotion that Judaism and Christianity are two separate covenants, that \nthe newer covenant is better, and that this is fundamental to \nChristian faith: Hebrews. This is not surprising. Hebrews includes 14 \nof the New Testaments 33 uses of the Greek word diathk \n(covenant) and 13 of its 19 uses of kreittn (better). If this \ntext is a comparison between Christianity and Judaism, is it so \nfar-fetched to draw the conclusion that Christianity is the better \nreligion? After all, the text explicitly states that in speaking of \na new covenant, [God] has made the first one obsolete. And what is \nobsolete and growing old will soon disappear (8:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how on earth are we to interpret Hebrews? And how can ministers \npreach it responsibly and well?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are Israel, say the gentiles whom God foresees in Midrash \nTanchuma. Supersessionism understands Judaism not as a distinct \nreligion from Christianity but rather as its prologue. In history, it \nis argued, Judaism preceded Christianity; moving forward, \nChristianity should proceed alone. Judaism paved the way, and now it \nshould make way. This way of thinking has been extraordinarily \ninfluential in Christian theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet many of us seek other ways to describe the relationship between \nJudaism and Christianityand the Bible provides us with an older, \nless-traveled approach. By asking old questions and articulating some \nnew answers, we can read these texts in such a way that the early \nChristian movements inherent Jewishness is given much stronger \nconsideration than it typically received only a couple of decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth the historical Jesus and the historical Paul are now firmly \nsituated within late Second Temple Judaism, and its understood that \nthe post70 CE writers of the New Testament form their theology and \nwrite their texts in the wake of the destruction of the temple, when \nall branches of Judaism had to cope with the fact that the sanctuary \nwas no more. A growing number of scholars now understand Judaism not \nas the gloomy background from which Christianity had to be removed in \norder to glow and grow but rather as the matrix one must restore in \norder to appreciate the New Testament texts more fully.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this endeavor to uncover an early Christian, non-supersessionist \nhermeneutics, Hebrews seems to be an exception: scholars, preachers, \nand people in the pew all seem to agree that Hebrews is a \nsupersessionist text. But in my opinion, it would be anachronistic to \nfind in such an early textit should reasonably be dated to right \naround 70 CEthe supersessionist theology that was developed only \nlater, when it became possible to consider Judaism and Christianity \nas two sharply defined religions. Have we sufficiently reflected on \nthis as a text written before they were perceived this way?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow on earth are we to interpret Hebrews? And how can ministers \npreach it responsibly and well?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps one thing that has contributed to this text being read \ntimelesslyby which I mean anachronisticallyis that we know so \nlittle about its historical context. I think Hebrews was originally a \nsermon, noteworthy for its elegant Greek and rhetoric, that \neventually was edited in order to fit the format of an epistle, but \nthat is far from the only suggestion. We cant be sure by whom, to \nwhom, when, where, or why it was written. Origen famously stated that \nwho wrote the epistle, in truth God knows. Introductory essays tend \nto suggest that it was probably written between 60 and 120 CE, and \nthat it has something to do with Italy (see Heb. 13:24). But that is \nall.\u0014\nThis lack of a minimum of historical knowledge has probably \ncontributed to the mainstream interpretation: that the text is the \nfirst example of the Christian supersessionism that later would \ndetermine so much of Jewish-Christian relations. In other words, \nHebrews is more often presented as the first volume in Christian \ndogmatics than as one of several enigmatic New Testament texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what about the use of the word covenant? Christians are so used to \nreferring to the Jewish Bible as the Old Testament and Judaism as \nthe old covenant that they might not be able to see what the \nanonymous author here actually has in view. At the time of the \ncomposition of Hebrews, the old covenant could not be a technical \nterm for Second Temple Judaism. And it is crucial to note that in \nHebrews, the new covenant above all belongs to the future. In other \nwords, Hebrews is far more eschatological than most readers have \nrealized. This is not far-fetched: if both the oldest letters \n(written by Paul) and the oldest Gospels (the synoptic tradition) are \neschatological, then why shouldnt the oldest preserved Christian \nsermon be as well?\u0014\n\u0014\nHebrews presupposes the dialectics between the present and the \nfuture: we now live in the time that is (9:9), and the author longs \nfor the time for a better order (9:10). The heavenly service, in \nwhich Jesus Christ serves as high priest, is already in progress; \nthis is invisible to human eyes, inaudible to human ears, and \nincomprehensible to human thoughts. But the time of the new era has \nnot yet completely broken. In the words of Peter J. Tomson: The new \ncovenant, if we may thus accentuate it, is valid only in heaven, not \nyet upon earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is also crucial to note how the verb palaioun (to grow old) is \nused. The word occurs three times in the New Testament: once in the \nGospel of Luke and twice in Hebrews. In Luke 12:33, Jesus encourages \nhis disciples to sell what they have and give alms, so that they \nprovide themselves with money bags that do not grow old (m \npalaioumena), a treasure in the heavens that does not fail as earthly \ngoods do. In Luke this verb is set in a comparison between earthly \npossessions (which are perishable) and heavenly treasure (which never \ngrows old).\u0014\n\u0014\nHebrews 1:1012 quotes Psalm 102:2628, praising God for the \ncreation, which, although breathtakingly splendid, one day will \nperish: it will wear out (palaithsontai) like clothing. The verb \nis used to describe the vulnerability and limitations of this world.\u0014\nThe third text is Hebrews 8:13, in which it is anticipated that the \nold covenant will soon disappear (engys aphanismou). Is not the \nmost plausible interpretation that the author here, too, articulates \nthe belief that one day this world will grow old and only God will \nremain? If so, this verse is an expression of an intense \neschatological longing for the future, for a complete and perfected \nworld.\u0014\nAnd if so, it is a tragic irony that so many Christians have inverted \nthe meaning in these two passages in Hebrewssuggesting that God \nactually does change, since God is understood as preferring a newer \nreligion to an older religion and wishing that the latter would \ndisappear. This is the opposite message of Hebrews 1:12: But you \n[God] are the same, and your years will never end.\u0014\n\u0014\nHebrews does not compare Christianity to Judaism. Instead, it \ncompares the future and perfect to the earthly and fragmentary. In \nshort, it compares heaven and earthand the author of Hebrews states, \nnot surprisingly, that the heavenly is perfect and the earthly is \ndeficient. The new is better than the old because the kingdom of \nheaven is better than earthly life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think that Hebrews 8:13 neither predicts the fall of the temple (if \nwritten before 70 CE) nor gives vent to theological schadenfreude (if \nwritten later). But I do believe that it articulates a profoundly \neschatological expectation. The message in Hebrews is hardly that \nChristian services are better than those that take place in \nsynagogues. Its that the celestial service is heavenly compared to \nearthlymore or less mundaneservices.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis line of thought is presented in more detail in a chapter of the \n2011 book Christ Jesus and the Jewish People Today, which I coedited \nwith Philip A. Cunningham, Joseph Sievers, Mary C. Boys, and Hans \nHermann Henrix. In fact, this interpretation of Hebrews has become \nrelatively influential. Among other places, its reflected in The \nGifts and the Calling of God Are Irrevocable (paragraph 18).\u0014\n\u0014\nIm convinced that the comparative paradigm (the new and the \nbetter) that has governed so much of Jewish-Christian relations is \nbased on a flawed reading of Hebrews, one that fails to consider the \nrole of early Christian apocalypticism. Here are three \nrecommendations that I hope will help us read Hebrews responsibly and \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/Hebrews, Most Dangerous Book for \nJews\u0014",

As a \nresult of their volunteer work, President Lincoln invited them with \nsome others to Washington. While on that trip, the Howes visited a \nUnion Army camp in Virginia and heard soldiers sing \"John Brown's \nBody,\" a song which celebrated the man who had attacked a Southern \narsenal in hope of triggering a rebellion against slavery.

I scrawled the verses almost without looking at \nthe paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext February, Atlantic Monthly printed Mrs. Howe's poem and paid her \n$4 for it. The entire nation was inspired by the words when they \nappeared, and the song became literally the battle hymn of the \nAmerican republic during the dark days of the Civil War. When the \nsong was sung at a rally attended by President Lincoln, he cried out \nwith tears in his eyes, \"Sing it again!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, Julia Howe remained active in reform causes as \nPresident of the American Woman Suffrage Association and the American \nBranch of the Women's International Peace Association.

She taught there for eleven years and \nconducted Sunday school in nearby Lawtons, NY on weekends. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer fame is as a missionary, however. In 1905 she heard Arthur \nSherman of the China mission speak. She was filled with longing to \njoin his China work, but her widowed mother said no. Harriet, her \nmom, and siblings compromised: Harriet could become a missionary \nnearer home. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe applied with her church in 1905. In the fall of 1906 they sent \nher for a year of training at a deaconess school. Among her classes \nwere Cooking for the Sick as well as Bible studies, missions, \nchurch history, bookkeeping and administrative and teaching courses.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1907 through 1960, the year Hurricane Donna ruined her home, she \nworked among Native Americans. Her first posting was to Whirlwind, \nOklahoma, where she taught school and won the confidence of the \nCheyenne through application of her small but much-needed medical \ntraining. She learned their language and was adopted into the tribe. \nIn 1910 she wrote, We have short Evening Prayer every night at seven \noclock, and the pupils come as regularly as they come to school. We \nseldom have an absence, and so are always sure of a congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter fighting off tuberculosis by temporarily moving to sunny \nColorado, she accepted a posting to Alaska.

While traveling through the lower United States to \nraise money, she visited Seminoles in Everglades City. Appalled at \ntheir living conditions and the way they were exhibited to tourists, \nshe took over a dying mission work and won their confidence by \narranging markets for their native crafts. She learned their \nlanguage, and during a funeral service was asked to go ahead (that \nis, take over). Unprepared, she translated the twenty-third Psalm \nimpromptu into the local dialect.

    "words": "Homer Rodeheavers Gospel Music Genius\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second half of the 20th century, a veritable whos who of \ncountry and gospel artists tried their hand at recording The Old \nRugged Cross, a classic hymn written over a century ago. Its \nenduring popularity testifies to the promotional genius of Homer \nRodeheaver, the mostly unknown but hugely influential gospel music \npublisher who had the good sense to purchase the rights to the song.\u0014\n\u0014\nRodeheaver, a trombonist who traveled with Billy Sundays \nevangelistic team, takes center stage in Homer Rodeheaver and the \nRise of the Gospel Music Industry, a new study from scholar-musicians \nKevin Mungons and Douglas Yeo. Robert Darden, a journalism professor \nand sacred music expert at Baylor University, reviewed the book for \nCT.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hands of what Mungons and Yeo describe as Rodeheavers \neffervescent, outgoing personality, writes Darden, Rodeheavers \nsignature trombone became his personal brand, his distinguishing \ncharacteristic as he led the singing for ever-larger revivals, \ncommunity sings, and evangelistic meetings. Here Yeos expertise \nyields a significant insight: Homers trombone playing wasnt very \ngood. But for a man with a million-dollar personality (and plentiful \nambition), it never really seemed to matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom there, Rodeheaver gravitated to the regional revival circuit, \nmoving from one evangelist to the next, leading the music that was \nessential to the boisterous services. All the while, he was becoming \nsomething of a draw himself, and by 1908, he had connected with the \ninfluential fraternity of gospel music publishers in Chicago. The \ntwin sides of Rodeheavers professional lifeas a charismatic song \nleader and a gospel publisher with an ear for great musicfed and \nempowered each other. He learned quickly that the secret to success \n(besides a winning personality; an adept, instinctive understanding \nof how to generate media coverage; and, well, a trombone) was singing \nthe songs people wanted to hearand then turning around and selling \nthem those very songs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the preWorld War I revival circuit in the United States, \nBilly Sunday was the dominant figure: a passionate orator who \nachieved rock-star status in Middle America for preaching the gospel \nto mammoth, adoring crowds. To Mungons  and Yeo, there was a certain \ninevitability to the ultimate partnership between the nations \nfastest-rising song leader and its preeminent evangelist. \u0014\n\u0014\nYoung, folksy, dashingly handsome, and very single, Rodeheaver \neventually replaced Sundays longtime song leader Fred G. Fischer, \nand by 1910 the team was barnstorming the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat separated Rodeheaver from the song leaders affiliated with \nother top revivalists (many of whom were also adopting trombones) was \nhis early relationship with the Chicago gospel publishing houses. His \ninnate likability endeared him to publishers and popular gospel \ncomposers alike, and his hymnals and songbooks became staples of the \nBilly Sunday tours, which routinely packed purpose-built 10,000-seat \narenas night after night, creating an inexhaustible demand for the \nsongs they featured. In time, Rodeheaver founded his own hugely \nsuccessful publishing house.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW GOD USED A HALF-MAD RUNAWAY TO BECOME A HERO",
    "words": "Tuesday, March 8 - Daily Story \u0014\nHOW GOD USED A HALF-MAD RUNAWAY TO BECOME A HERO TO THE DOWNTRODDEN\u0014\n \u0014\nNo one knows why eight-year-old John Duarte Cidade followed a priest \nfrom Portugal to Orepeza, Spain (near Toledo). In Orepeza, kindly \nFrancisco Mayoral took in the starving boy and employed him as a \nshepherd. John, who had been born on this day, 8 March 1495, in \nMontemor Novo, spent long days in meditation. In his early twenties \nhe joined the forces of the Count of Oropesa, abandoned his morals, \nand nearly lost his life when dispatched against the French at \nFontarabia. This was not through military engagement, but because of \ndereliction of duty, for he permitted the theft of loot he was \nsupposed to be guarding. When he was about to be hanged, a passing \nofficer obtained his release. John returned to shepherding. \u0014\n\u0014\nFour years later, he rejoined the army and served throughout Europe \nfor eighteen years. He was among Emperor Charles Vs forces when they \nrepelled the Turkish invasion that reached the walls of Vienna. \nLeaving the military life, he finally visited his hometown in \nPortugal. There he learned that his mother had died of a broken heart \nshortly after his disappearance, and his father, left alone, had \njoined a monastery where he died. With nothing in Portugal to hold \nhim, John returned to Spain in deep remorse at the pain he had caused \nhis parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain he became a shepherd, this time near Seville. Now he no longer \nlooked after sheep alone, but began to assist the poor around him. As \nhis biographer Francisco de Castro related, When he sadly remembered \nhow well fed, protected and healthy the horses in the Count of \nOropesas stables were, whilst the poor were so badly off, ragged and \nhungry, he said to himself: John, would it not be better if you \nlearned how to feed and care for the poor people of Jesus Christ \nrather than farm animals? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe became concerned for Christians held as slaves in Africa and \nsailed there to see if he could be of some help. Thrown into the \ncompany of a Portuguese noble exiled for a crime, he hired himself \nout to feed the man and his family who were sick. He labored on \nfortifications to earn a pittance. Conditions were so cruel and so \nclose to slavery that he had to leave Africa lest he be tempted to \nflee into Moorish territory where he would have to abandon Christian \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in Spain, he confessed his sins and dedicated his life to \nChrist. To support himself he became a traveling bookseller, \ndisseminating religious books and pictures at minimal markup. \nEventually he set up shop in Grenada. There he heard John of Avila \npreach, was convicted of his previous wrongdoing, and behaved so like \na madman that he was actually incarcerated in an insane asylum.\u0014\n\u0014\nTouched by the sufferings of the insane, he determined to care for \nthem, and began cleaning their wards, comforting them at their \nbedsides, and praying with them. Upon his release he commenced the \nwork for which he became known as John of God.\u0014\nFor thirteen years he worked himself to the bone caring for the sick, \nthe insane, and repentant prostitutes. By day he gathered wood, \ncarried the sick to his hospital, nursed them, hauled water, and did \nall he could to relieve their sufferings. Many repented of sins and \ndied at peace with God. In the evenings he begged. At night he \nprostrated himself in prayer. Many miracles were reported of him. The \nchaplain of his hospital, Francisco de Castro, appealed to common \nknowledge to confirm those that he retold. John kept up his strenuous \nlabors until his body was emaciated and his strength almost gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, to the very end no one applied to him in vain for help. Some \ntook advantage of his trust and tender-heartedness, but he said they \nwould have to answer for it to God. Helpers joined him. Two of the \nmost famous had been bitter enemies: Antonio Martin and Pedro \nPecador Velasco. Converted and forgiving each other, they became \nJohns assistants and were among those who founded the Brothers \nHospitallers of St. John of God after Johns death. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat death came about because he plunged into a swollen river to \nrescue a boy. He failed to save the lad and caught pneumonia from \nexposure. He wished to die among his patients, but a wealthy \npatroness obtained a command from an archbishop that John go to her \nhouse for care. Even her ministrations could not save his worn body. \nHe died on this, his birthday, 8 March 1550, just fifty-five years \nold. His funeral rivaled that of monarchs. On 1 January 1571 Pope \nPius V endorsed the Hospitaller Order, defining their dress and \nplacing them under the same religious rule as the Augustinians.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\nOther Notable Events\u0014\n\u0014\nMarch 9, 1550\u0014\n\u0014\nDeath in Grenada of John of God on his fifty-fifth birthday, having \ncontracted pneumonia through plunging into an icy stream to rescue a \nyouth. Impulsive and tenderhearted he had operated a hospital for the \nhomeless and insane which he supported through hard work and begging.\u0014",

    "words": "FRS: All of the statements included in this article are not \ndocumentable historically.\u0014\n\u0014\nRunaway Slave Harriet Tubman Returned South to Rescue Her Family\u0014\n \u0014\nWHILE Harriet Tubman is celebrated today, this amazing woman was \nalready a legend in her own lifetime. \u0014\nTubmans life began as a slave in Maryland. Had she been treated with \nkindness, she might never have become one of the most-famous \nconductors on the underground railroad or a spy for the Union during \nthe American Civil War. However, she experienced the full brutality \nof the slave system. Her family members were sold south. She was \nwhipped to compel her to work night and day without sleep until her \nhealth broke. One master even forced her to haul loads some men would \nhave staggered under. At times she was flogged, starved, and \nthreatened. When she was thirteen, an overseer cracked her skull when \nhe flung a two-pound weight at another slave. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Tubman believed the gospel. After her mother nursed her back to \nhealth, the faithful Christian girl prayed that her master would \nbecome a Christian. However, when she learned that he was going to \nsell her south she pleaded, Lord, if you aint never going to change \nthat mans heart, kill him, Lord...so he wont do no more mischief. \nThe master died suddenly. Tubman was horrified, knowing he must have \ngone to hell. Oh, then it peared like I would give the world full \nof silver and gold, if I had it, to bring that poor soul back, I \nwould give myself; I would give everything! But he was gone, I \ncouldnt pray for him no more. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Tubman and her brothers fled north. By then she was a \nmarried woman, and she resolved by the Lords help to make a home for \nher family in the North and bring them there. The frightened brothers \nturned back, but Tubman refused to stay in slavery, vowing never to \nbe taken alive. She said, Lord, I'm going to hold steady on to You \nand Youve got to see me through. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was as good as her word, returning to Maryland nineteen times, \nfirst to attempt the rescue of her husband (who refused to join her) \nand later to lead over three hundred other slaves to safety. Southern \nplanters offered a $40,000 reward for her, dead or alive. However, \nshe put her confidence in the Lord and was never caught. \u0014\n\u0014\nTubman lived to be about 93 years old, dying on this day 10 March \n1913 in a home for aged African-Americans that she had founded. \nToday, statues and plaques commemorate Tubman. President George H.W. \nBush proclaimed Harriet Tubman Day on the day of her death in her \nmemory, and the Post Office later issued a stamp in her honor.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "HUTU VS. TUTSI IN RWANDA",
    "words": "HUTU VS. TUTSI IN RWANDA\u0014\n \u0014\nAlthough the Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda spoke the same language, \nshared the same culture, and could not always be identified by \ndifferences in appearance, ethnic tensions were strong between them \nin the twentieth century. These were aggravated by land shortages and \npast rivalries, by earlier colonial discriminationand by faulty \nchurch policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe minority Tutsi had ruled the country when European missions first \narrived, and the missions sided with them. When the Hutu came to \npower (partly through the efforts of individual Catholic priests), \nthe top hierarchy of the mainline churches realigned with the Hutu. \nDiscrimination against Tutsi became strong within Catholic, \nPresbyterian, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist churches. (By \ncontrast, the fast-growing Pentecostal movement rejected any power \nalignment and its members were less prone to join in racial \nrivalries.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe majority Hutu in Rwanda massacred groups of Tutsis several times \nin the decades following Independence from colonialism. Tutsi exiles \nformed an army in nearby Uganda and attacked Rwanda several times, \naggravating tensions. In neighboring Burundi, where Tutsis held the \nupper hand, they massacred 200,000 Hutus in 1972. In the 1980s and \n1990s, the Hutu government of Rwanda, under fire for corruption, \nstaged acts of violence that it blamed on Tutsis. According to \ninternational agencies, it also fomented violence and chaos that it \nthen claimed was the result of multi-party efforts to reform the \ngovernment. In this way it exploited and ramped up ethnic tension in \na desperate gamble to retain power.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Rwandas mainline churches often spoke out against violence, \nthey did so in general terms without identifying specific culprits. \nThey urged support for the Hutu government. Many churchgoers took \nthis as assent for Hutus to target Tutsis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone shot down the airplane of Rwandan President Juvenal \nHabyarimana on this day, 6 April 1994. As if on cue, Hutu radicals \nrounded up and killed Tutsis and moderate Hutu in Kigali, the \nnational capital. Over the next few days, Habyarimanas successors \nsent operatives across the country in a pre-planned and coordinated \neffort to exterminate Tutsis. Government radio broadcasts incited \nkilling. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made the resulting genocide more horrifying was that killers and \nkilled had worshiped together. In fact, many Hutu priests not only \negged on the murders, but identified Tutsi parishioners and manned \nbarricades to capture any who tried to escape. At Ngoma parish, Hutus \nwent to the church each morning to pray before heading out to \nparticipate in the days slaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe governments method was to encourage Tutsi to gather for \nsanctuary in churches and schools (where in previous massacres Tutsi \nhad been spared) and then to slaughter them en masse. Ten or twenty \nthousand Tutsi might be killed at a single church. So many were \nkilled in the church at Nyamata that survivors later converted it \ninto a memorial for the murdered.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver a period of three months, about 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered, \noften with great cruelty. Tutsi survivors who had hidden in swamps \nspoke of drinking muddy water enriched with the blood of the dead. \nThey told of Hutus hacking open pregnant women to kill their babies \nbefore their eyes. Attackers hacked off Tutsis limbs, rather than \nkill them outright, laughing and singing all the while; then left the \nwounded to die in agony over the course of two or three days. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere and there Hutu individuals, especially among Pentecostal \nChristians, actively aided Tutsis. In the few parishes where \nChristian leaders actively opposed the violence, a smaller proportion \nof Tutsi died. Some Hutus even chose to die with Tutsis they were \nprotecting. Timothy Longman, in Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, \ntells of Flicitas Niyitegeka, a sixty-year-old nun, who rejected \noffers to spare her life, choosing to die with the people she was \ntrying to protect. She was shot last.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe genocide did not cease until commander Paul Kagames Tutsi army \ninvaded Rwanda from neighboring Uganda where it had been training. \nKagame drove out the killers, toppled the Hutu regime, and \nestablished a new government with Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, as \npresident. However, Kagame soon jailed Bizimungu on accusations of \ninstigating ethnic killing. Over a million Hutus fled to the Congo \nwhere international opinion tended to take their side. Violence \ncontinued because Rwanda warred against the Hutu refugees, many of \nwhom had been involved in the massacres and were armed and militant.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the restoration of peace in Rwanda, Tutsis and Hutus worship \ntogether again, but not without suspicion. As one survivor remarked, \nI know that all the Hutus who killed so calmly cannot be sincere \nwhen they beg for pardon, even of the Lord. For them the Tutsi will \nalways be the enemy.\u0014",

    "title": "HALLELUJAH! HANDEL'S MESSIAH",
    "words": "Hallelujah! Handel's Masterpiece\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nAt twelve noon, on this date, April 13, 1742, the world first heard \nthe lovely overture, memorable arias and majestic choruses of the \nmost famous oratorio ever written. There has not been a year since \nthen that George Frederick Handel's Messiah has not been performed in \nconcert halls around the world. Usually it appears in numerous halls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe performance took place in Dublin, in the Fishamble Street Musick \nHall. Dubliners received it with enthusiasm. \"...the best judges \nallowed it to be the most finished piece of music,\" wrote the Dublin \nGazette. \"Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it \nafforded...\" Two performances were given. Two years later, annual \nperformances were established in Dublin. London did not receive the \noratorio as readily. Criticized, it did not catch on there until 1749.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel had turned to oratorios, most of them on religious themes, \nafter opera failed him. Messiah was special even within its genre. \nThe composer deliberately wrote it so that it could be performed by \nas few as four singers with strings, continuo, two drums and two \ntrumpets. The idea was to produce a work which could be staged \nanywhere. Handel was often near destitution, and a piece like \nMessiah, which could be performed by small ensembles, offered him \nopportunities to raise desperately needed cash.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe text, by Charles Jennens, pulled together fragments of scripture \nrelating to Christ. The power of the scriptures came by laying them \nforth almost as translated (he used more than one translation where \nit suited his purpose) and joining them so that they built on and \nclarified one another without comment. Old and New Testament passages \nwere placed beside each other where a relationship existed. Where \nJennens modified passages, he did so to make them scan better and to \nkeep the texts in the third tense throughout. Handel, although a \nrough-tongued man, claimed to know the Bible as well as any bishop \nand made a few alterations himself. Jennens, a devout Anglican, \nintended through his libretto to challenge the Deists who denied \nChrist's divinity: \"And his name shall be called Wonderful, \nCounselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of \nPeace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe succeeded in his intent, for Messiah portrays Christ as Son of \nGod, the fulfillment of prophecy, Savior of the world, and coming \nKing. John Newton, slaver turned clergyman, preached fifty sermons on \nthe text. Although Newton preached his series as a rebuke to those \nwho glorified the music above God's word, he said that it \ncomprehended all the principle truths of the Gospel. That Jennens \nfused the words together without once backtracking or repeating a \npassage demonstrates the perfectionism which made him a fussy person.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel united the whole into a magnificent artwork, writing the work \nin twenty-three fervent days, despite having already suffered a \nstroke. The music often rises to great loveliness and power. Passion \nbuilds until the climactic Hallelujah chorus. Of this chorus, Handel \nsaid in his broken English, \"I did think I did see all heaven before \nme and the great God himself!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarne, Kitty.

    "title": "HELLO! I'M RECOVERING RACIST",
    "words": "Hello, Im a recovering racist\u0014\nIDELETTE MCVICKER  |  APRIL 13, 2022   BAPTIST NEW GLOBAL\u0014\n\u0014\niA bilingual apartheid sign declaring 'This beach is for the use of \nWhite Persons Only' on a beach near Hermanus in the Cape Province, \nSouth Africa, December 1974. (Photo by Jonathan C. \nKatzenellenbogen/Getty Images)\u0014\nHi, my name is Idelette, and I am a recovering racist.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am in recovery from the racist ideas that shaped my consciousness \nfrom the very moment I was conceived, amid one of the most racist \nsocial and political stories in history. I was born in South Africa, \nas an Afrikaner woman, during apartheid.\u0014\n\u0014\nApartheid literally means separateness, and it was an intricate \nsystem of laws that separated people based on the color of their skin \nfrom 1948 to 1994. It was a political system, a human-invented system \nthat deeply divided society. The system of apartheid and the more \nthan 300 years of colonized rule leading up to it robbed Black, \nindigenous and people of color of land, resources and education. It \ntried to rob people of dignity, strength and even language.\u0014\n\u0014\nApartheid had done its work in such a deep way that when I left South \nAfrica at the age of 23  for work, for adventure and to find a more \nloving and inclusive world  I did not have any friends who were \nBlack, indigenous or people of color.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am now 48 years old. I have lived on three continents, and when I \nstarted this journey of recovering from apartheid, I believed what we \nhad done in South Africa was one of the worst things in the world. In \nfact, the General Assembly of the United Nations had labeled \napartheid a crime against humanity. As terrible as it was, I began \nlearning that apartheid was not just a South African thing, or even \nan Afrikaner thing. I learned that the evil we needed to address, \nwhat had been around a lot longer, what took on different forms on \ndifferent continents and in different periods in history is racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy recovery journey\u0014\n\u0014\nI am in recovery from a system and a consciousness that had created a \nhuman hierarchy based on the color of someones skin. These were all \npersonal ideas first, which then became political ideas, which then \nbecame policies and laws, which then became embedded into structures \nof injustice. Racist ideas also became embedded into our bodies and \ninto our consciousness. I will most likely be in recovery for the \nrest of my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI hate racism and what it has done. I hate the pain it has caused, \nthe structural inequality it has literally built into the land, and \nthe economic inequality it has created and perpetuated. I hate it for \nthe pain it causes Black, indigenous and people of color. I hate how \nit has killed and harmed and still kills and harms Black, indigenous, \nand people of color. I hate that we, white people, have done this. I \nalso hate racism for how it has robbed white people of our humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I had been walking this journey out of apartheid for a long \ntime, there was still something missing. I was running away from \nbeing called a racist, wanting to prove to the world I was not one of \nthose people. Then I learned a more beautiful and liberating way: \nacknowledging my racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was very early on a Friday morning in April 2016. Kelly Brown \nDouglas, Episcopal priest and author of Stand Your Ground, stood at \nthe podium in a room full of mostly white people in Grand Rapids, \nMich. The United States was in the throes of a presidential election \ncampaign between the first-ever female presidential candidate and a \nformer reality TV star. I was listening intently, furiously writing \nnotes, when she said, The only thing white people can ever be are \nrecovering racists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThud.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid I hear correctly? I nudged my friend Kelley next to me. She \nnodded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only thing white people can ever be are recovering racists. As \nDouglas words landed in my heart, my body simply responded, Yes. \nIt felt like my body acknowledged the truth of it before my mind did. \nI came to a state of quiet acknowledgment, feeling that a long \nrestlessness had finally ended.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had been on a quest for years to prove to the world how not racist \nI was. Sitting in that room, facing the ugliest of truths about \nmyself and my story, I finally stopped hiding. I no longer needed to \nhide or to prove to the world that I was a good white person. I \nwasnt.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had been on a quest for years to prove to the world how not racist \nI was.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was a recovering racist.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacial sobriety\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible tells us that truth sets us free, although, if I am really \nhonest, I was hoping for a different kind of truth. Not an ugly \ntruth. Not this kind of truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacial sobriety is that moment of hitting rock bottom, seeing our \nplace in the human story clearly  no running, no hiding, no \njustification, no denial, no defensiveness. Only quiet, sober \nacknowledgment and acceptance of this very ugly truth. And right \nthere, something else too: the beginning of liberation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I faced my ugliest self, I also was able to embrace my most whole \nself. I stopped scrambling for belonging. In that moment, I no longer \nhad anything to prove  I couldnt. I was as human, as broken and as \nbeautiful as every other human being on this planet. I exhaled.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly two years earlier, at a dinner party in our home, it was the \nthing I least wanted to admit. Being a racist was, for me, the most \nshameful thing I could ever be accused of. When somebody said the \nword racist at the table, jokingly indicting me and a handful of \nother white people at the table, I burst into tears. I was as fragile \nas white could be. The word racist carried deep shame for me \nbecause it was interconnected with my culture, my identity and the \nstory of my people. I felt like I had something to prove to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a racist was, for me, the most shameful thing I could ever be \naccused of.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was born in South Africa in 1972, on the white side of the \nhospital. October is already spring in South Africa, but my mom says \nthat day was so cold and miserable that she had to buy a new winter \nrobe for her hospital stay. It was a cold and miserable season in the \nhistory of South Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1948 the National Party, an ethnic, nationalist party that \npromoted Afrikaner interests in South Africa, gained political power \nand won elections based on their policy of racial segregation. Only \nwhite people had voting rights at that time, and after winning, the \nNational Party began implementing a comprehensive set of laws to \nsegregate people based on race. Afrikaner people made up only about \n5% of South Africas population, and apartheid was how a \nwhite-minority government dealt with its presence in a majority Black \ncountry.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was unaware of this political drama when I was born, and for the \nmost part I grew up in a white bubble. Apartheid had achieved exactly \nwhat it had set out to do: separate people. It had created a whites \nonly story for any white person who wanted to cling to that. I grew \nup steeped in Afrikaner nationalism, Afrikaner symbolism and \nAfrikaner history. I was raised to be proud of Afrikaner culture and \naccomplishments.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaised as an Afrikaner\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps it would help to clarify that there are two quite distinct \ncultural groups of white people in South Africa  those who are white \nand speak English and those who are white and speak Afrikaans. Only \nwhite South Africans who speak Afrikaans are called Afrikaners. \nAfrikaans, my mother tongue, is a Creole language consisting of Dutch \nmixed with Malay, Portuguese, Indonesian and the indigenous Khoekhoe \nand San languages. In spite of its rich and diverse origin story, \nAfrikaans was implemented as a weapon to strengthen Afrikaner \nnationalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first 18 years of my life, I grew up in an almost exclusively \nwhite, Afrikaans-speaking environment. Our house was in an all-white \nneighborhood. For 12 years of my life, I went to an all-white school \nwith all instruction in Afrikaans (other than for our English \nclasses, of course). Every Sunday we sat in an all-white, \nAfrikaans-speaking church. These white environments had been \nintentionally created by the racist laws of apartheid. My personhood \nwas formed in one of the most extreme racist political systems in \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy personhood was formed in one of the most extreme racist political \nsystems in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some sense, I had been not to the mountaintop of humanity but to \nthe bleakest valley of whiteness. I imagine that the creators of \napartheid had intended for me, as a daughter of apartheid, to reap \nonly its privileges and its benefits. But how can you commit  and \nbenefit from  a crime against humanity and not bear its weight?\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later, sitting in that cold lecture hall in Grand Rapids, I was \nstill struggling for clarity, healing and freedom from what I had \nlearned and internalized during those first decades of my life. I was \nlooking for any and every crumb of liberation in order to reclaim and \nrecalibrate my humanity. I wanted to make the world better. I wanted \nto pay for that crime against humanity. I didnt know how, but I was \ndesperate to find a way. I knew I was not responsible for all of it, \nbut I was responsible for my part.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a recovering racist, I told Kelly later that evening. It was \nthe first time I had said those words out loud, and it felt important \nto do so.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe nodded. She knew.\u0014",

    "title": "HEIRS TO NAZI FORTUNES NOT APOLOGIZING",
    "words": "They Are the Heirs of Nazi Fortunes, and They Arent Apologizing\u0014\nApril 19, 2022   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nBy David de Jong\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. de Jong is a former reporter for Bloomberg News and the author of \nNazi Billionaires: The Dark History of Germanys Wealthiest \nDynasties, from which this essay is adapted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe backbone of Germanys economy today is the car industry. Its not \njust that it accounts for about 10 percent of G.D.P.; brands like \nPorsche, Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen are recognized around the world \nas symbols of German industrial ingenuity and excellence. These \ncompanies spend millions on branding and advertising to ensure they \nare thought of this way. They spend less money and energy on \ndiscussing their roots. These corporations can trace their success \ndirectly back to Nazis: Ferdinand Porsche persuaded Hitler to put \nVolkswagen into production. His son, Ferry Porsche, who built up the \ncompany, was a voluntary SS officer. Herbert Quandt, who built BMW \ninto what it is today, committed war crimes. So did Friedrich Flick, \nwho came to control Daimler-Benz. Unlike Mr. Quandt, Mr. Flick was \nconvicted at Nuremberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis isnt exactly a secret in modern Germany, but it is happily \nignored. These titans of industry, the men who played a central role \nin building the countrys postwar economic miracle, are still \nwidely championed and celebrated for their business acumen, if not \ntheir wartime deeds. Their names adorn buildings, foundations and \nprizes. In a country that is so often praised for its culture of \nremembrance and contrition, an honest, transparent acknowledgment of \nthe wartime activities of some of Germanys richest families remains, \nat best, an afterthought. But until these companies  and Germany  \nare more open about the Nazi history of their patriarchs, reckoning \nwill remain incomplete.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve been reporting on these families for a decade, first as a \nreporter for Bloomberg News, then while writing a book about German \nbusiness dynasties and their Third Reich histories. Ive pored over \nhundreds of historical documents and academic studies, as well as \nmany memoirs. Ive spoken to historians and visited archives across \nGermany and beyond. And Ive been shocked by what I learned.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the Quandts. Today, two of the familys heirs have a net worth \nof roughly $38 billion, control BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and have \nsignificant holdings in the chemical and technology industries. The \nfamilys patriarchs, Gnther Quandt and his son Herbert Quandt, were \nmembers of the Nazi Party who subjected as many as 57,500 people to \nforced or slave labor in their factories, producing weapons and \nbatteries for the German war effort. Gnther Quandt acquired \ncompanies from Jews who were forced to sell their businesses at below \nmarket value and from others who had their property seized after \nGermany occupied their countries. Herbert Quandt helped with at least \ntwo such dubious acquisitions and also oversaw the planning, building \nand dismantling of an uncompleted concentration subcamp in Poland.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war ended, the Quandts were denazified in a flawed legal \nprocess in postwar Germany that saw most Nazi perpetrators get away \nwith their crimes. In 1960, five years after inheriting a fortune \nfrom his father, Herbert Quandt saved BMW from bankruptcy. He became \nthe companys largest shareholder and began restructuring the \ncompany. Today, two of his children, Stefan Quandt and Susanne \nKlatten, are Germanys wealthiest family, with near-majority control \nof BMW. The siblings manage their fortunes in a town near Frankfurt \nfrom a building named after their grandfather.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe modern-day Quandts cant claim ignorance of the actions of their \nfather and grandfather. The information above is included in a 2011 \nstudy commissioned by the Quandt dynasty four years after a critical \nTV documentary exposed some of the familys involvement in the Third \nReich. Despite commissioning the study, which was conducted by a \nhistorian and a team of researchers, the BMW heirs seem to prefer to \nmove on as though nothing had been learned.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his sole interview in response to the studys findings, Stefan \nQuandt described the familys distancing from his father and \ngrandfather as necessary but a massive and painful conflict. And \nyet Gunther Quandts name remains on their headquarters, and Stefan \nQuandt awards an annual journalism prize named after his father. \nStefan Quandt said he believed his fathers lifes work justified \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the interview, Stefan Quandt said that the familys most important \ngoals in commissioning the study were openness and transparency. \nBut for another decade, the website of the Herbert Quandt Media Prize \nfeatured a biography of its namesake that made no mention of his \nactivities during the Nazi era, except for saying he joined the board \nof his fathers battery company in 1940.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat changed only in late October 2021. It was more than a decade \nafter the study was produced but conspicuously only a few months \nafter I had asked the family a question about it. Today an expanded \nbiography mentions part of the studys findings, such as Herbert \nQuandts responsibility for staffing at battery factories in Berlin \nwhere forced and slave laborers were exploited. But it still omits \nHerbert Quandts involvement in the concentration subcamp project, \nhis use of prisoners of war at his private estate and his help \nacquiring companies seized from Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2016, BMWs charitable arm was consolidated under the name BMW \nFoundation Herbert Quandt. It is now a major global charity, with \nabout $150 million in assets, supporting sustainability goals and \nimpact investing. Stefan Quandt and Ms. Klatten are among its \nfounding donors. If the foundations website is to be believed, \nHerbert Quandts entire biography consists of one act: He secured \nthe independence of BMW. The charitys motto is to promote \nresponsible leadership and inspire leaders worldwide to work \ntowards a more peaceful, just and sustainable future.\u0014\n\u0014\nBMW and its controlling shareholders, Mr. Quandt and Ms. Klatten, \narent unique in their revisionism. In 2019 the Ferry Porsche \nFoundation announced that it would endow Germanys first \nprofessorship of corporate history at the University of Stuttgart. \nThe Porsche company established the foundation in 2018, 70 years \nafter Ferry Porsche designed his first sports car. Dealing with \nones own history is a full-time commitment, the charitys chairman \nwrote in a statement. It is precisely this critical reflection that \nthe Ferry Porsche Foundation wants to encourage, because: to know \nwhere youre going, you have to know where youve come from.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could have started closer to home. The foundation is named after a \nman who voluntarily applied to the SS in 1938, was admitted as an \nofficer in 1941 and lied about this for the rest of his life. During \nmost of the war, Mr. Porsche was busy leading the Porsche company in \nStuttgart, which exploited hundreds of coerced workers. As Porsches \nchief executive in the postwar decades, he surrounded himself with \nformer high-ranking SS officers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 1976 autobiography, Mr. Porsche gave a twisted historical \naccount, full of antisemitic statements, about Porsches Jewish \nco-founder, Adolf Rosenberger. He even accused Mr. Rosenberger of \nextortion after he was forced to flee Nazi Germany. The truth was \nthat in 1935, Ferry Porsche received Mr. Rosenbergers company shares \nafter his father, Ferdinand Porsche, and brother-in-law, Anton Pich, \nbought the co-founder out of the company, paying far below market \nvalue for his shares.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday Porsche doesnt just sponsor professorships or make sports \ncars. Together with their cousins the Pichs, the Porsches control \nthe Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, \nSeat, Skoda and Volkswagen. The combined net worth of the \nPorsche-Pich clan is estimated at around $20 billion. They are now \npreparing to spin Porsche off from the Volkswagen Group and list the \nsports car company in what is shaping up to be one of the largest \ninitial public offerings of 2022.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Porsches have never publicly addressed the activities of their \npatriarchs during the Third Reich. And it wasnt only Ferry Porsche \nwho was implicated: Ferdinand Porsche, who designed the Volkswagen, \nduring the war ran the Volkswagen factory with Mr. Pich. There, tens \nof thousands of people were used as forced and slave laborers to \nmass-produce weapons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ferry Porsche Foundation endowed the professorship at the \nUniversity of Stuttgart because members of its history department \npublished a company-funded study in 2017 about the Porsche companys \norigins in the Nazi era. But the study seemed to leave a lot out: \nSomehow none of Mr. Rosenbergers personal papers were included in \nthe research. The study also mischaracterized the nature of Mr. \nRosenbergers share sale. The more I looked at the study, the more it \nbegan to look more like a partial whitewash than a full accounting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there are the Flicks. Friedrich Flick controlled one of \nGermanys largest steel, coal and arms conglomerates during the Third \nReich. In 1947 he was sentenced to seven years in prison for war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity. At his Nuremberg trial, he was \nfound guilty of using forced and slave labor, financially supporting \nthe SS and looting a steel factory. After his early release in 1950, \nhe rebuilt his conglomerate and became the controlling shareholder of \nDaimler-Benz, then Germanys largest carmaker. In 1985, Deutsche Bank \nbought the Flick conglomerate, making his descendants billionaires.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday a branch of the Flick dynasty worth about $4 billion maintains \na private foundation in Dsseldorf named after their patriarch. The \nfoundation  which has a seat on a board of one of Germanys most \nprestigious universities and directs money to educational, medical \nand cultural causes, primarily in Germany and Austria  is still \nnamed after a convicted Nazi war criminal in whose factories and \nmines tens of thousands of people worked in forced or slave labor, \nincluding thousands of Jews. But looking at the foundations website, \nyou would never learn of the Flick fortunes tainted past.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can it be that three of Germanys most powerful business \nfamilies, their companies and their charities are so out of step with \nthe countrys lauded remembrance culture?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I asked Jrg Appelhans, the longtime spokesman for Stefan Quandt \nand Ms. Klatten, about their use of their grandfathers and fathers \nname on their headquarters and media prize, he sent me an email \nsaying, We dont believe that renaming streets, places or \ninstitutions is a responsible way to deal with historic figures \nbecause doing so prevents a conscious exposure to their role in \nhistory and instead fosters its neglect.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is an especially shameless contortion. These families arent \nshowing the bloody history behind their fortunes except, sometimes, \nin commissioned studies written in dense academic German whose \nfindings they then leave out when describing their family history \nonline. They arent even dealing with them in an honest fashion. They \nare, in fact, doing the opposite: commemorating their patriarchs \nwithout mentioning their Nazi-era activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nRepresentatives for the billionaire Flicks declined to comment when I \napproached their family office. When I asked why there is no \nbiography of Ferry Porsche on the website of his namesake foundation, \nSebastian Rudolph, the foundations chairman, said that it is \nexamining to what extent this should also be represented on the \nfoundation website, adding that we view the lifes work of Ferry \nPorsche in a differentiated light.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor decades, remembrance culture has been a central component of \nGerman society. Across German cities and villages, youll find \nStolpersteine, the brass-and-concrete cubes with the names and life \ndates of victims of Nazi persecution. Memorials, big and small, are \neverywhere. In cafes from Berlin to Frankfurt and from Hamburg to \nMunich, there are daily conversations about collective guilt and \natonement. These are reflective, nuanced and, above all, aware.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet this movement toward facing the past is somehow bypassing many of \nGermanys most revered tycoons and their dark histories. The more \ntime I spent learning about these business dynasties, their tainted \npasts, fortunes and companies, and their desire to ignore or cover up \nhow involved their patriarchs were with the Third Reich, the more I \nbegan to doubt how deep, sincere and lasting this culture of \nremembrance in Germany really is.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe car industry is quintessentially German, so very central to not \njust the countrys economy but also its identity. Would a repudiation \nof these tycoons be a disavowal of national identity? Do these men \nneed to be championed because they remain potent symbols of Germanys \nresurgence and economic might? Does celebrating business success \nstill matter more in Germany than acknowledging crimes against \nhumanity? Or is the real answer something simpler: Perhaps the \ncountry is beholden to a few billionaires and their global companies \nwho care more about protecting their reputations  and their fortunes \n than about facing up to the past.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid de Jong (@davidthejong) is the author of Nazi Billionaires: \nThe Dark History of Germanys Wealthiest Dynasties, from which this \nessay is adapted.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE CHOSEN",
    "words": "CanonHow books of the Hebrew Bible were chosen\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Marc Brettler\u0014\n\u0014\nThe canonical books of me Bible are those books included as opposed \nto those excluded.\u0014\nThe English word canon derives from a Greek word meaning measuring \nrod. Canon thus refers to the books that measure up to being \nincluded within a particular literary corpus. By definition it \nimplies a process through which various books are judged, and \nsuggests that certain books were excluded as noncanonical. As a \nresult, books that are included within a canon have much greater \nprestige and authority than those that are excluded.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Jews and Christians have grown up with the notion of canonical \nscriptures, but the idea is really quite radical within the context \nof the ancient Near East. To the best of our knowledge, no other \nancient Semitic civilization attempted to sort through its literature \nand relegate part of it to a higher status by deeming it canonical \nwhile demoting the status of other literary works by denying their \nadmittance into the canon.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did the notion of canon develop specifically in Israel? \nUnfortunately, the process by which the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible \nwere canonized is not clearly described either in biblical or \nrabbinic literature. All we can do is reconstruct the process based \non hints and clues.\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly the canonization of the Hebrew Bible did not occur at a \nsingle moment under the auspices of some religious power group. This \nis obvious from the tripartite structure of the Hebrew Bible: (1) \nTorah (the PentateuchGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and \nDeuteronomy), (2) Neviim (literally, the Prophets, but actually the \nhistorical books of Joshua through Kingscalled in Jewish tradition \nthrough Former Prophetsand the prophets Isaiah through Malachi, \ncalled in Jewish tradition the Latter Prophets) and (3) Kethubim \n(Writings; that is, sundry material). This order is probably \nreflected in Luke 24:44, which refers to the law of Moses [Torah] \nand the prophets [Neviim] and the psalms meaning Kethubim, here \ncalled after the first and largest book in the collection of writings.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain books in the Hebrew canon do not seem to fit the category to \nwhich they are assigned. The Kethubim include Daniel, which is really \na prophetic book, and Chronicles, which parallels the historical \nbooks of Samuel and Kings in the Neviim section. Had the Bible been \ncanonized at a single moment, Daniel would have been placed adjacent \nto a prophetic book such as Ezekiel and Chronicles would have been \nnext to Kings, since this is where they belong thematically. (In most \nEnglish Bibles, which follow the order in the Greek translation of \nthe Bible known as the Septuagint, that is where these books appear). \nSince Chronicles and Daniel are late books (probably from the fourth \nand, second century B.C.E., respectively), the best explanation for \nwhy they were not incorporated into Neviim is that the Neviim \nsection of the canon was closed by the time they were composed. This \ninconsistent ordering suggests that Neviim was canonized before \nKethubim. More generally, we deduce that the Torah was canonized \nfirst, then the Neviim and finally the Kethubim.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is difficult to assign dates to each stage of this process. \nAccording to some scholars, the texts now incorporated in the Torah \nwere completed before the Babylonian Exile of 587/586 B.C.E., while \nothers claim that the latest Torah texts were composed during the \nBabylonian Exile or after the return to Zion in 538 B.C.E. It is \nlikely that either the experience of being exiled, or of trying to \nlive through the Exile, or of trying to reconstitute a community in \nthe land of Israel after the return to Zion would have involved \nreligious consolidation. This would have included asking which legal \nand historical traditions are authoritative or, central. Discovering \nthe correct legal traditions was probably an especially pressing \nissue for the exilic community, since several prophets had predicted \nthat destruction or exile would result from abrogation of the law \n(see, for example, Amos 2:45). Therefore, to end the catastrophe of \nExile, or to rebuild a successful community in Israel, it was \nnecessary to choose those texts that incorporated the laws that must \nbe observed. These had to be chosen from a multiplicity of legal and \nhistorical traditions that different groups in ancient Israel claimed \nto be authoritative, divine revelation. Several were chosen and \nultimately became canonized as Torah, (the) teaching that served as \nthe legal yardstick for this community in crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough canonization involved rejection of certain traditions which \nwere ultimately forgotten, it did not produce a uniform, monolithic \nwork. Different conceptions of creation exist side-by-side in Genesis \n12; different slave laws are legislated in Exodus 21, Leviticus 25 \nand Deuteronomy 15; and different celebrations of the fall \ningathering festival, Sukkot, are posited in Exodus 23:16 (compare \n34:22), Leviticus 23:2343 and Deuteronomy 16:1315. This suggests \nthat canonization was an inclusive process, aimed at including or \nenfranchising several different groups within ancient Israel. At the \npoint of canonization, no group had enough power to foist its texts \non others as the only legal teaching. The final result was a diverse \nand sometimes contradictory work, incorporating texts and traditions \ncentral to different groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nA similar process must have transpired with Neviim (Prophets). \nAncient Israel certainly had more than the 15 prophets who have their \nown books in the Bible (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve \nMinor Prophets). The biblical text itself refers to some of these \nother prophets and their prophecies; for example, Jeremiah 28 \nmentions a prophet named Hananiah, son of Azzur. At some point, a \nselection had to be made from among the works and oracles of these \nprophets. Given that the Torah was already canonized, the criterion \nof Deuteronomy 18:22, that a true prophet may be recognized by the \nfulfillment of his oracle, was probably central in deciding what \nprophetic works would be included in the canon. Prophets whose \nprophesies were not validated were excluded from the canon. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis process probably occurred some time between the fifth century \nB.C.E. (the date of Malachi, the latest of the prophetic books) and \nthe second century B.C.E. (the accepted scholarly date of Daniel, \nwhose prophetic book is not included among the Hebrew canon of \nNeviim). The canonization of the Neviim involved the same type of \ncompromises described in the canonization of the Torah; Neviim \nincorporated diverse depictions of God and a variety of different \ntheological notions concerning such basic issues as theodicy (the \nproblem of unexplained evil in a world created by a just God), \nretribution and repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is difficult to know precisely when the section Kethubim \n(Writings) was completed. The latest book within the division is \nprobably Daniel, which can be dated to the mid- to late-second \ncentury B.C.E. The earliest mention of 24 books as comprising the \nentire Bible is from the apocryphal book known as the Fourth Book of \nEzra, which dates to the late first century C.E. (This number counts \nSamuel, Kings, the 12 minor prophets, Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles \neach as one book.) The late first-century C.E. Jewish historian \nJosephus seems to corroborate this. Josephus claims that the Bible \ncontains 22 books; he probably counts Ruth and Judges as a single \nbook and Jeremiah and Lamentations (traditionally believed to be \nwritten by Jeremiah) as a single book; thus his 22 books are the same \nas Fourth Ezras 24. This suggests that the Hebrew Bible as a whole, \nand therefore Kethubim, was canonized sometime between the second \ncentury B.C.E. and the first century C.E.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Kethubim section reflects the same diversity seen in the Torah \nand Neviim. Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes present radically \ndifferent views of how God rules the world. Psalms and Song of Songs, \nboth beautiful and poetic, set forth different notions about the \nrelationships central to human existence. These multiple perspectives \nwere incorporated because they were important to different groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the evidence allows for canonization of the entire Hebrew \nBible between the late second century B.C.E. (when Daniel was \nwritten) and the late first century C.E. (when Fourth Ezra and \nJosephus mention the complete canon), most scholars used to claim \nthat the final canonization took place in the first century C.E. at \nthe Council of Jamnia (or Jabneh). However, no such council was \never convened to discuss the canonicity of biblical texts. Its \nexistence is based on an erroneous understanding of several \nsecond-century C.E. rabbinic texts, which discuss whether particular \nbiblical texts, such as Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs, defile the \nhands (with ritual impurity). However, the phrase to defile the \nhands refers to whether a book is divinely inspired and not to its \ncanonical status. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese rabbinic debates concern inspiration, not canonicity. There are \nalso several discussions about hiding away the books of Ezekiel, \nProverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs. However, these are \ntheoretical academic discussions reflecting the theological problems \nraised by these biblical books; they were so problematic that one \ncould imagine decanonizing them. These rabbinic discussions are not \nfull-fledged debates; no one would really think of removing Ezekiel \nor Proverbs from the canon. Thus, these rabbinic texts do not prove \nthat the Hebrew Bible was canonized only in the first century C.E. by \na group of rabbis. More likely, the Hebrew Bible was already \ncanonical, that is, authoritative, before the late first century C.E. \nFurthermore, the canon reflects the judgment of popular rather than \nrabbinic groups concerning which texts should be regarded as central.\u0014\n\u0014\nA particular work might be excluded from the canon for various \nreasons: it did not reflect the legal practices of a predominant \nsocial group, its prophecies were not verified or it was written in \nthe too recent past. This last factor, that books of recent vintage \nwere not typically canonized, precipitated the rise of \npseudepigrapha, or false writingsbooks which claimed to be written \nmuch earlier than they actually were by attributing their authorship \nto an important biblical personality. This fiction began during the \nbiblical period. For example, clear linguistic and historical \nevidence suggests that Daniel was written in the second century \nB.C.E., yet the text itself implies that it was written three \ncenturies earlier. The author of Daniel made this false claim so his \nbook would become an instant, ancient classicand he succeeded! Other \nbooks from the second century B.C.E., such as the Wisdom of Ben \nSirah, made no attempt to falsify their date or origin, and \nsubsequently were not canonized within the Hebrew Bible. Several of \nthese (the Wisdom of Solomon as well as the Wisdom of Ben Sirah), \nhowever, are considered canonical within the Catholic Church and may \nbe found in Catholic Bibles. These texts, which are preserved in the \nearly church canon but not in the rabbinic canon, are called the \nApocrypha.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was the fate of books that at each stage failed to make it into \nthe canon? Neither burned nor forcibly removed from circulation, \nrejected books were often forgotten and abandoned. However, some \nworks written in the late first millennium B.C.E. and in the early \nfirst millennium C.E. escaped oblivion by being preserved as \napocrypha and pseudepigrapha\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(2004).

    "words": "I Kings 3:16-27\u0014\n\u0014\nFor generations, people of the Middle East, and everywhere else in \nthe world, have used simple stories, stories that are easy to \nremember and easy to retell, to convey the most basic of truths. \nEvery rabbi used the method because they didnt have any paper \ncompanies close at hand, and no copy machines available, and even if \nthey had had these things most people didnt have the reading skills \nto use them anyway. So they had to use a method that was both \nimmediately arresting and easily remembered. That was the highlight \nof Jesus teaching method.\u0014\n         \u0014\nThe story in our text today is one of these. Its a ridiculously \nsilly story of two women of questionable character (prostitutes, the \ntext says) who had babies and who lived together. One of them lost \nher child by death. It wasnt SIDS; she rolled over on him. She \ndecides to claim that the remaining child is her own. Theyre unable \nto resolve the problem so they managed to appear before Solomon to \nsettle the matter. Well, he orders the child to be halved, one half \ngiven to each woman. The woman who is not the true mother, according \nto the story, is willing to do that just to spite the other. If I \ncant have him, you aint goin have him either. (I assume they were \nnot close friends.) The true mother, of course, offers to give up the \nchild entirely rather than see it harmed in any way. Now picture that \nin your mind for me. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm sure you agree with me that the woman whos not the true mother \nis not only a liar, shes dumb as a brick. Who would want half of a \ndead baby? The same story, by the way, is found in many other \ncultures of that day with their leader being the wise one instead of \nSolomon. Notice also that this story is not basically about the \nmothers; its about Solomon, and the writer has as his purpose to \nillustrate how wise and cunning Solomon was. (By the way, I dont \nthink Solomon was the wisest man in the world by any stretch of the \nimagination. Anybody who would choose to have 700 mothers-in-law has \ngot to be an idiot.) But the story also illustrates the true love of \na good mother, her sacrifice, her willingness to endure loss even so \nunjustly if she has to, and thats what I want to talk about today, a \ngood mothers love.\u0014",

    "words": "Michael James Brody, Jr. was an heir to the Jelke oleomargarine \nfortune; upon reaching his twenty-first birthday in 1970, he rented a \nmansion in Scarsdale, New York, and with his bride (whom he had met \ntwo weeks before when she came to Scarsdale to sell his friends some \nweed) announced to the world that he would start giving away his \nfortune to anyone who asked, because he wanted \"peace in the world.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote thousands of dollars worth of personal checks and \ndistributed his largesse to all who asked. He later said that the \nidea came to him while high on drugs. The response was so \noverwhelming that he soon had to go into hiding, at about the same \ntime many recipients of his checks found when they attempted to cash \nthem that they were worthless, since the bank they were drawn on \nrefused to honor them. Brody's gift giving career ended in April 1970 \nwhen he was temporarily committed to a California mental institution \nafter filing a false police report, and was then subsequently \narrested on a charge of marijuana possession. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn late 1971, he was arrested on charges of making threats against \nthe life of President Richard Nixon, and was also found sitting on \nthe lawn of his sister's house in Norwalk, Connecticut while the \nhouse itself burned to the ground. Although Brody was arrested on an \narson charge, the charges were later dropped. Brody soon faded from \npublic view, and subsequently took his own life.\u0014\n\u0014\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jane Margaret Laight\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael James Brody Jr., the millionaire heir who offered to give \naway his fortune, shot and killed himself yesterday at, his \nfather-in-law's home in Ashoken, N. Y., the Ulster County sheriff's \noffice said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sheriff said the 24-year-old heir, who lived nearby in Woodstock, \napparently placed .243-caliber Savage deer-hunting rifle between his \nknees and shot himself once in the head.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was found at about 1 P.M. in the home of Robert Dubois, where he \nfirst met his Wife and embarked with her on a headline-making attempt \nto bring peace and prosperity to the world by writing checks on \nfortune estimated at $25-million.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years his behavior became even more erratic than it had \nbeen in 1970, when he proclaimed himself the Messiah, wrote hundreds \nof checks that never cleared the bank and attracted hundreds of \ndestitute people to his rented $400,000 home in Scarsdale.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had been placed in psychiatric care twice since thenonce in \nCalifornia, when he was picked up at the San Francisco Airport raving \nabout kidnap attempts, and again more recently after he was charged \nwith arson in the burning of rented house in Norwalk, Conn.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was free on $10,000 bond pending trial on charges that he had \nthreatened the life of President Nixon in a series of semicoherent \ntelephone calls.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of his conduct, he said publicly, was the result of hundreds of \ndoses of LSD, the hallucinogenic drug.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe actual extent of his fortune was never made public, He once \nclaimed that it extended into the billions of dollars, but a lawyer \nwho had probated his inheritance once said that it was $1-million, \nevenly divided between Mr. Body and his sister, Robinand all of it \nheld in trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ulster County sheriff's office said yesterday that Mr. Brody \napparently lived on monthly checks from a trust fund.\u0014",

    "words": "Franz Mohr, Master Piano Tuner and Evangelist\u0014\nThe chief concert technician for Steinway & Sons gave Bibles to the \nworlds greatest pianists and told them about Jesus.\u0014\nPETER K. JOHNSON|     MAY 20, 2022 Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nFranz Mohr, former chief concert technician at Steinway & Sons in New \nYork, has died at 94.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was, in his own assessment, just a piano tuner who loves the \nLord.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mohrs expertise and backstage support was valued by the worlds \nmost famous concert pianists, including Van Cliburn, Vladimir \nHorowitz, Artur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould, Rudolf Serkin, and Emil \nGilels. They relied on his deep musical knowledge and technical skill.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe traveled around the world with them, protecting and servicing \ntheir concert-grade grand pianos, each of which was built by 200 \nSteinway & Sons artisans and cost more than $200,000. Mohr prepared \nthe pianos with tuning, voicing, and adjustments for optimal \nperformance to the artists particular liking. Between concerts, he \ncould be found in Steinway Halls basement in Manhattan, doing \nregular, meticulous maintenance.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis true passion, however, was unashamedly proclaiming the love and \nhope of Christ to this niche community.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was like a magnet drawing them in, said Tom Carpino, Franzs \npastor at The Bridge (Nazarene) Church, in Malverne, New York, and \nbringing the Bibles message to whomever he could.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranz was a member of The Bridge for more than 40 years and served \nfor many years as an elder. He also regularly spoke to Christian \ngroups and worked with Crescendo International, a Cru ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith my little tuning hammer I have shared the Lord in unbelievable \nplaces, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died at home on March 28 from complications related to COVID-19.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr was born in Nrvenich, Germany, on September 17, 1927. He was \nthe second of three sons in a musical family in which Mendelssohn, \nMozart, and Beethoven were as familiar as bratwurst and potatoes. His \nfather, Jakob, was a postal worker who enjoyed singing and playing \nthe guitar, mandolin, and zither.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr played the violin and viola and studied music in Cologne and \nDetmold.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdolf Hitlers rise to power and the subsequent war completely \ntransformed Mohrs idyllic world and threw him into a spiritual \ncrisis that lasted many years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of 17, on November 16, 1944, he lived through an air raid. \nAs he later recalled, he was sitting on the roof of his family home \nwatching the sky when he sensed something terrible was about to \nhappen. Everything got quiet and the rabbits and chickens in the \nbackyard huddled together in a corner and refused food.\u0014\n\u0014\nSearching the horizon, he saw waves of incoming planes, flying low \ntoward Dren. He rushed to the family bomb shelter with his parents \nand younger brother, Peter. Within 20 minutes, 1,800 B-17 bombers \nobliterated the city.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the bombs fell in the darkness, his mother, Christina, cried to \nGod for help. Mohr screamed, Shut up, Mom! There is no God!\u0014\n\u0014\nDazed, Mohr crawled out of a hole in the shelter wall. Smoke choked \nthe air as fires continued to burn and delayed-action bombs exploded \naround him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the confusion, Mohr was separated from his family. He fled to the \ncountryside where a farmer took him in.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned to the city and reunited with his parents just before \nChristmas. They told him his brother Peter had died in the attack and \nurged him to join them at church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr exploded, How can there be a God?\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr rejected God again a few years later when an evangelical \nminister from Cardiff, Wales, tried to talk to him about Christ. Mohr \naccepted a Bible but blew off the pastor with nasty insults.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after, he learned that his other brother, Tony, had been killed \nby Russian soldiers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, Mohr joined a Dixieland band for American soldiers, \nplaying gigs around country. Though his life was good now that the \nwar was over, Mohr struggled with feelings of emptiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was miserable and lost. He frequently couldnt sleep and developed \nan ulcer. The lifestyle made him feel despondent, but he couldnt \nchange. At 21 years of age, he considered suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen one restless night he decided to pray. His thoughts were drawn \nto Calvary and the two criminals next to Jesus on the cross, \nespecially the one who, having trusted Jesus, heard the Lord say, \nTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise (Luke \n23:43).\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, he knew that Jesus took his sin. Gods love and mercy \noverwhelmed him. He became so excited about his new faith that he \nquit the band and devoured the Bible day and night.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined a small church and preached in the streets. Next came \nmarriage and a family. For work, he took a position as an apprentice \nto a piano maker and this opened new opportunities. A German-speaking \nBaptist church in New York sent over an advertisement for a piano \ntechnician for Steinway, and Mohr applied and got the job. The family \nemigrated in 1962.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr did not know, initially, how people would respond when he shared \nhis faith in the world of concert pianists. But he believed he should \ntell people about Jesus anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe started giving away Bibles and found they were received \ngraciouslyand sometimes with great joy.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce, he met a young pianist from Moscow who had won the the Van \nCliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, Texas, and was \npracticing in Steinways basement for a concert in Carnegie Hall. \nFollowing Gods leading, Mohr gave the man a Russian Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially anxious about the pianists reaction, Mohr was dumbfounded \nwhen the pianist grabbed him, crying, Franz, you have no idea what \nyou have done. I have never in my life seen a Bible. I came to \nAmerica with a desire in my heart to obtain a Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiving Bibles to concert artists he worked for became customary. He \neven hid Bibles in his luggage traveling with Vladimir Horowitz for \nconcerts in Moscow and Leningrad in 1986, when Bibles were forbidden.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people Mohr spoke to did not always find faith. He became quite \nclose to Horowitz, for example, but the pianist never accepted his \nmessage of Good News.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had opportunities a few times to talk to Horowitz about the Lord, \nabout salvation, Mohr wrote, yet as far as I know, there was never \nany real breakthrough where with assurance I could say that he \nbelieved, and knew where he would be going after death.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr retired from Steinway & Sons in 1992 but continued working as a \nconsultant. He wrote a memoir with Edith Schaeffer called My Life \nwith the Great Pianists.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also spoke in churches and looked for new opportunities to share \nhis faith and inspire future generations of Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1990s, Mohr connected with Crescendo International, a \nCru ministry based in Basel, Switzerland, that links professional \nmusicians and music students with Christians via lectures and events \nin concert halls, festivals, and churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohr served Crescendo for more than 20 years as a director and \nspeaker, touring annually in Europe. He lectured on concert piano \ntechniques, weaving his testimony into every lesson.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranz was so relaxed, speaking in a natural way about God, said \nBeat Rink, Crescendo founder and international director. His \nlectures also encouraged Christians to be more open in sharing the \ngospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Mohrs son Michael, director of restoration and customer \nservices at Steinway & Sons, Mohr remained spritely and in good \nhealth until around mid-2021. During Mohrs final days at home, he \ncomforted his family saying, Dont worry, the best days are yet to \ncome.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW ANDREW JACKSON LOST A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION",
    "words": "How Andrew Jackson Lost a Presidential Election and Wound up in the \nWhite House\u0014\n\u0014\nBY DAVID S. BROWN   JUNE 11, 2022   TIME\u0014\nBrown is the author of The First Populist: The Defiant Life of Andrew \nJackson. \u0014\nCharges of stolen presidential elections are rare in American \nhistory. Only three candidatesAndrew Jackson, Richard Nixon, and \nDonald Trumphave been associated with such claims. In Nixons case, \nrumors of voting irregularities in the 1960 race against John F. \nKennedy prompted many of his supportersincluding president \nEisenhowerto demand recounts in Texas and Illinois. Nixon refused, \nhowever, insisting it would tear the country to pieces, and later \nwriting, I could think of no worse example for nations abroad, who \nfor the first time were trying to put free electoral procedures into \neffect, than that of the United States wrangling over the results of \nour presidential election, and even suggesting that the presidency \nitself could be stolen by thievery at the ballot box.\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson and Trump thus stand as our only presidents to challenge the \nlegitimacy of their defeats. In a race with four candidates, Old \nHickory, as Jackson was known, captured a plurality of electoral \nvotes in the 1824 contest, but not a majority. Accordingly, a \nconstitutionally prescribed contingent election was held in the House \nof Representatives (each state casting a single ballot) in which John \nQuincy Adams handily outdistanced the General 13 to 7 (Secretary of \nthe Treasury William Crawford took 4 states).\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before the House met, Jackson, sensing the possibility of \ndefeat, had written to a colleague alleging intrigue and abuses \nby designing politicians. These partisans were wary of western \npopulism, he supposed, and eager to upend his attempt (as a \nTennessean) to become the first president to hail from neither \nVirginia nor Massachusetts. Insisting that an East Coast \ncombination conspired to swing the election toward Adams, he swore \nthe day after learning of his defeat, The People of the west have \nbeen disregarded, and demagogues barter them as sheep in the \nshambles.\u0014\nJacksons insistence on a stolen election energized his already \nconsiderable political support. One Jacksonian argued that a series \nof corrupt bargains brought Adams to the presidency and this claim \nbecame, over the next four years, the rallying cry of the new \nadministrations critics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the steal assertion lacks credibility. Nearly 60% of the \nelectorate voted for Jacksons opponents, while the Twelfth Amendment \nsimply asserts that when the House selects the president a majority \nof all the states shall be necessary to a choiceand does not \nstipulate that the candidate with the most popular or electoral votes \nshould receive any advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jackson believed for the rest of his life that he had been \nrobbed. Motivating his base, he attacked, in a well-circulating \ncorrespondence, both the Adams administration and the nimble \nwirepullers whom he presumed had cheated the people of their \nchampion. In one communication he contended that liberty never was \nin greater danger. . . . Let the Presidency be transmitted by the \nexercise of a corrupt patronage . . . and we shall soon consider the \nform of electing by the people a mere farce.\u0014\nJackson went on to win the presidency in 1828 and reelection in 1832, \nbut it was the 1824 campaign, prefaced by his momentous victory at \nthe Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812, that forged his \npath to power. He successfully portrayed himself as a political \noutsider (despite having served, albeit briefly, in both the House \nand Senate), eager to take on an arrogant coastal aristocracy. The \nresults of the contingent House election only burnished his \ncredentials as the candidate that the circa 1820s deep state had \nwished to destroy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Trumps case it is yet unclear how much fruit this latest charge \nof ballot-fixing will bear. What role might it play in flipping the \nHouse and Senate in this years elections? How decisive will it be in \ndetermining who takes the oath of office on January 20, 2025? \nObserving Jacksons inauguration in the late winter of 1829, \nMassachusetts senator Daniel Webster mused in some amazement over the \nstolen election claim and the storm it had raised. I never saw \nanything thing like it before, he wrote a relative. Persons have \ncome 500 miles to see Genl Jackson; & they really seem to think that \nthe Country is rescued from some dreadful danger.\u0014\nWhile president, Trump rhetorically embraced Jackson as a fellow \npopulist opposed to liberal elites. But the strongest tie between the \ntwo might be their shared sense of conspiracyand the insight that \nsuch allegations have the power, in a divided country, to move the \npolitical needle.\u0014",

    "words": "Benjamin Rush (1746-1813)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe enlightened doctor\u0014\n\u0014\nRush is a second-tier revolutionary who is not as well-known as he \nought to be. Although he was a member of the Continental Congress \nfrom Pennsylvania and a signer of the Declaration of Independence in \n1776, he was not primarily a politician but a physician and \nscientist, indeed, the most celebrated physician and scientist in the \nearly Republic. More than either Franklin or Jefferson, Rush \npersonified the American Enlightenment. Since he came to believe that \nthe science of medicine was related to everything, he considered \neverything within his intellectual domain. Believing he was acting \nfor the benefit of the whole world and of future ages, he campaigned \nfor every conceivable reformfor a national university, churches for \nBlacks, temperance, healthy diets, the emancipation of slaves, prison \nreform, free postage for newspapers, enlightened treatment of the \ninsane, the education of women, animal rightsand the abolition of \nhunting weapons, dueling, and corporal and capital punishment. He was \nnot so utopian, he said in 1786, as to think than man could become \nimmortal, but he did believe that it is possible to produce such a \nchange in his moral character, as shall raise him to a resemblance of \nangelsnay, more, to the likeness of God himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a physician, he was a great bleeder, tending to bleed all his \npatients regardless of the nature of their illnesses. Unfortunately \nfor his patients, however, he overestimated the amount of blood in \nthe human body. He thought most people had twelve quarts of blood, \ndouble the six quarts in the average person. Since he often took from \nhis patients as many as five quarts of blood in a day and a half, it \nis not surprising that so many of them died. The acerbic Philadelphia \njournalist William Cobbett termed Rushs bleeding one of those great \ndiscoveries which are made from time to time for the depopulation of \nthe Earth. But, one of Rushs greatest achievements was bringing the \ntwo estranged former friends, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, back \ntogether in their retirement years.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordon S.

    "title": "HUDSON TAYLOR, FOUNDER OF CHINA INLAND MISSION",
    "words": "Alone Among 500 Million Souls\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nMy feelings on stepping ashore I cannot attempt to describe. My heart \nfelt as though it had not room and must burst its bonds, while tears \nof gratitude and thankfulness fell from my eyes.\" So wrote Hudson \nTaylor of the moment of his landing at Shanghai, China on this day, \nMarch 1, 1854 at 5 p.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years his heart had burned with desire to carry the gospel to \nChina. He had exerted every ounce of his energy for this moment. \nThrough weary struggles, through bouts of depression, through storm \nand danger of shipwreck, through heart-wrenching separation from his \nfamily, in isolation from other Englishmen, in hours of intense \nprayer, he had persevered to step upon this shore.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe did not know a soul, nor where to turn, although he had on him a \nletter to a missionary already established on Chinese soil. But \nHudson Taylor had learned much about trusting the Lord, and this \nnight his trust was not misplaced. As if guided, he found his way \nthrough the unfamiliar oriental streets to a mission compound where \nhe was kindly received.\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing worked out according to his expectations. His first six \nmonths in China were dreary and lonely. His income was tiny and he \ncould do little. Civil war began the week he arrived and rival gangs \nslaughtered people before his horrified eyes. Unable to rent a house \nas he had hoped, he had to impose on his kindly hosts. He flung \nhimself into language learning, to the neglect even of his devotions. \nHis mission board embarrassed him with its ignorance of China.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor overcame these difficulties and many more. He learned \nthe language and made up his mind to adopt native dress. It was his \nhope to establish a thoroughly native church. The Chinese, he felt, \nhad little to do with Christianity because they hated foreign ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis methods proved successful. In time he broke gracefully away from \nhis English board and founded the China Inland Mission, based wholly \non faith. He did not tell others of his financial needs, trusting \nthat the Lord would provide whatever was needed. He prayed \nspecifically for his needs and for more missionaries. One year he \nprayed for 70 missionaries. The Lord sent 76. Another year he asked \nfor 100 and got 102. The Lord also provided their passage money. At \nhis death the China Inland Mission had 205 missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor married Maria Dyer, who died tragically young. Nearing \ndeath, she kissed Hudson again and again, for each of their eight \nchildren. She had been a true support to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson was left to carry on without her. Chinese Christianity grew \nslowly. For many years the number of Protestants hung at barely a \nmillion. Under savage persecutions, Christianity flourished. Today \nthe Chinese church is thought by some analysts to be the fastest \ngrowing in the world. Chinese Christians owe their first contact with \nthe Gospel to the evangelism of men such as Hudson Taylor. When he \nstepped in faith onto Shanghai's soil, he became one of the greatest \nmissionaries the world has known.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor.

The pattern has held steadily into the 21st century, \nincluding in 2006, when the Israeli-Lebanon war only ended when the \nU.S. and France intervened, brokering a UN resolution. Even if an \nIsraeli government wants to stop fighting, it cannot, because that \nwould mean admitting that it never had a chance of keeping its \npromise to solve Israels problems by simply letting the IDF win. \nIn effect Jabotinskys insight, that crushing military victories were \nnecessary, but only to set the stage for a political compromisewhich \ncould bring peacehas been forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis history exposes that Israels current laundry list of war aims \nisnt designed to be achievable. Rather, these goals are political \nstatements put in place so that after the U.S. inevitably forces an \nend to the fighting, Netanyahu and his government can claim they \nwouldve achieved lofty goals, if only the U.S. had not interceded.  \u0014\n\u0014\nAn American order to stop is not what Israeli leaders fear, it is \nwhat they expect, and it is what the country always needs. And \nhistory shows it will comeeventually. Like previous presidents, \nPresident Biden is learning that there are excruciating trade-offs \nbetween the dangers, risks, and human costs of allowing an Israeli \nmilitary campaign to continue and the domestic political consequences \nof stopping it. When he decides the former concerns outweigh the \nlatter, he will give the order. Then and only then will this war end.\u0014\n\u0014\nIan S. Lustick is the Bess W.

    "words": "Harvard Chair Went to Doubting Wigglesworth\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |    APR 28, 2010\u0014\n \u0014\nHow did America's great Christian colleges come to abandon their \nfaith and become the secular institutions they are today?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Harvard College was founded by the Puritans in 1636, they knew \nwell what they wanted from their school. \"Let every Student be \nplainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the maine \nend of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is \neternal life, John 17:3, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottome, \nas the only foundation of all found knowledge and Learning...\" The \ngreat school was intended to produce a godly clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn less than a hundred years, that high ideal faltered. Liberals won \ncontrol of the school. On this day, January 24, 1722, they appointed \nEdward Wigglesworth to fill the newly created Thomas Hollis chair at \nHarvard College. This made Mr. Wigglesworth the first divinity \nprofessor commissioned in the American colonies, but what should have \nbeen cause for rejoicing was actually reason to mourn.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Wigglesworth had convinced orthodox members his theology was \nsound, it was not. In Three Centuries of Harvard, Samuel Eliot \nMorison described what happened next: \"One of the first theologians \nin New England who dared publicly to challenge the 'five points of \nCalvinism,' he [Wigglesworth] employed the deadly method of doubt in \ninquiry, rather than direct attack... Wigglesworth was a prime \nfavorite with Harvard students, and he and his son Edward, who \nsucceeded, had a very great influence on New England theology. It was \nthe Wigglesworths who trained the pioneers of liberal Christianity in \nNew England--the ministers who led the way out of the lush but \nfearsome jungles of Calvinism, into the thin, clear light of \nUnitarianism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the evangelist George Whitefield came to the United States, he \ndenounced liberal colleges as \"abodes of darkness, a darkness which \ncould be felt.\" The men of Harvard were \"Pharisees, resting on head \nknowledge,\" he said. Wigglesworth retorted that Whitefield was \nfiscally corrupt, demonstrated bad manners and unleashed dangerous \nenthusiasm among the masses, destroying the peace of New England's \nparishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1701, Yale was founded to counter Harvard's drift from orthodox \nCalvinism. By 1805, Unitarians controlled Harvard. Had Wigglesworth \nhad a fervent faith, his appointment this day might have prevented \nthat slide to heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDictionary of American Biography.

    "words": "How Did Erasmus Influence the Protestant Reformation?\u0014\nErasmus never joined the Protestant movement, but many scholars would \nargue he set the stage for the Reformers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |  JUN 14, 2023\u0014\n \u0014\nErasmus never joined the Protestant movement, but many scholars would \nargue he set the stage for the Reformers.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's what you need to know about his influence and legacy:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTable of Contents\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus Loaded the Reformation Cannon\u0014\n\u0014\nGlarean Blessed Erasmus\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus Loaded the Reformation Cannon\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus loaded the cannon that Luther fired. The greatest scholar of \nhis day, Erasmus rammed two shots into the barrel of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first shot was a satire titled, The Praise of Folly, which poked \nfun at the errors of Christian Europe. For example, Erasmus reminded \nhis readers that Peter said to the Lord, \"We have left everything for \nyou.\" But Folly boasts that, thanks to her influence, \"there is \nscarcely any kind of people who live more at their ease\" than the \nsuccessors of the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second shot was a Greek New Testament. For centuries, Jerome's \nLatin translation, the Vulgate, was the Bible of the Church. However, \nJerome's translation had deficiencies. Erasmus reconstructed the \noriginal New Testament as best he could from Greek texts and printed \nit. In a parallel column he provided a new Latin translation. What is \nmore--and this could have cost him his life--he added over a thousand \nnotes that pointed out common errors in interpreting the Bible. He \nattacked Rome's refusal to let priests marry although some lived \nopenly with mistresses; and he denied that the popes have all the \nrights that they claim. The scholar also challenged practices not \ntaught in scripture: prayers to the saints, indulgences, and \nrelic-worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter years of work, Erasmus was ready to release his book. He \nwondered how he could avoid trouble. One way was to link the New \nTestament with some great man's name. And so, on this day, February \n1, 1516, Erasmus dedicated his New Testament to Pope Leo X. He had \ngotten the Pope's permission the year before. In a soothing letter \nwritten to Leo a few months later, he assured him that he meant no \nharm. \"We do not intend to tear up the old and commonly accepted \nedition [the Vulgate], but amend it where it is corrupt, and make it \nclear where it is obscure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust in case the authorities should be angry, Erasmus pointed out \nthat the ideas were not new with him. He quoted the greatest church \nfathers in support of his corrections. It would be a lot harder for \nintolerant factions to argue with dead heroes than with him!\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Jerome's translation, Erasmus' New Testament was not completely \naccurate either. He did not have access to the best manuscripts. \nNonetheless, it was enough of an improvement over the old that Martin \nLuther, William Tyndale, and other translators based their vernacular \nversions on it. Furthermore, they picked up Erasmus's calls for \nreform.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result was that the Reformers broke away from the Roman Catholic \nchurch. For a time Erasmus and Luther remained friends. But Luther's \nwords were so violent that Erasmus could not accept them. When \nErasmus did not agree with Luther, the Reformer called him all sorts \nof names, such as \"secret atheist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus, who thought that the Christian life meant living in the \npeace of Christ, was hurt. He was in grave danger from both camps. \nProtestants said he held onto too much that was Catholic; the \nCatholics threatened him because they claimed he was wrecking the \nchurch. Erasmus had to flee from Catholic Louvain to escape being \nburned to death at the stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus had such a reputation for wit that people were willing to \nwait quietly for him to answer a question. Frederick the Wise once \nasked the scholar his opinion of Luther. Erasmus thought while the \nking waited silently. Finally he answered, \"Two 'crimes' Luther has \ncommitted: he has attacked the tiara of the pope and the bellies of \nthe monks.\" Frederick laughed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not often hear of Erasmus. Yet Anabaptists, Zwinglians, and \nLutherans claimed to be his true children. His Bible and his wit \nhelped bring about the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.

    "title": "HOW THE TWO TESTAMENTS BECAME ONE BIBLE",
    "words": "How the Two \nTestaments Became One Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen production of two-testament Bibles began in the fourth century, \nthe notion already had centuries of precedent.\u0014\nI love asking long-established couples how they first met. From Ruth \nand Boaz on, such stories often reveal the kindness and sovereignty \nof God in sweet and sometimes unpredictable ways, especially if the \nunion appeared on paper unlikely, but has gone on to be happy and \nfruitful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one couple, whose union at first seemed extremely unlikely, \nbut which has gone on to be happy and fruitful for two thousand \nyears: the union of the two testaments in the Christian Bible. But \nhow did our two testaments come together? How did those books, which \nfirst-century Christians were writing about Jesus, come to be \nincluded with the Jewish Scriptures in what we call the Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\nUniting the Bibles two testaments\u0014\n\u0014\nIts an important question, because the unity of our Bibles matters \nmore than many Christians today realize and effects many \ncontroversial questions. The unity of Scripture means that one of the \nmost important contexts for interpreting any biblical passage is the \nrest of the Bible. By approaching the Bible as one united collection \nof books, the early Christians were saying that the context of a \nbiblical book within the Bible is as or more important than its \noriginal historical context in ancient Judaism or Greco-Roman culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe unity of the Bible is also the basis for connecting themes and \nsymbols across the Bible. This assumes that the Bible has a grand, \noverarching story, rather than being an assorted collection of \nanecdotes, moral teachings, and theological ideas. This assumption is \nbasic to Christian preaching, theology, and ethical interpretation of \nthe Bible, but it only makes sense if the two testaments actually do \nbelong together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was far from obvious in the first century AD. Imagine how you \nwould feel if someone suggested that some new books, from our own \ntime, deserved to be bound into your Bible. Thats what the early \nChristians started to do to the Jewish Scriptures, from very soon \nafter the death of Jesus. From as far back in the history of the \nchurch as we can trace, it seems to have been uncontroversial among \nChristians that these new books, about Jesus, had the same authority \nas the Jewish Scriptures, which Jews had been reading, revering, and \nseeking to obey for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading the two testaments as one book\u0014\n\u0014\nWe see beginnings of the story in the New Testament. First Timothy \n5:18 appears to quote Deuteronomy and then something very similar to \nMatthews Gospel, and calls them both Scripture. Second Peter 3:16 \nunambiguously calls Pauls letters Scripture. The Greek word \ntranslated Scripture (graphe), means anything written. But in \nreligious contexts, it almost always meant authoritative Scriptures. \nWhen New Testament authors call other New Testament books \nScripture, they are saying that these early Christian books have \nthe same status as the Old Testament Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, the early-second-century Christian writer Polycarp quotes \nEphesians and calls it Scripture (Polycarp, Philippians 12.) Justin \nMartyr, also in the second century, records what a worship service \nlooked like in his church (Justin, First Apology 67). It included \nreadings both from the Old Testament Scriptures and the memoirs of \nthe apostles, which probably means the Gospels or related texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, the second-century heretic Marcion believed that \nChristians should not read the Old Testament. Marcion is interesting, \nbecause by the time he was active, only about a century after the \ndeath of Jesus, it was uncontroversial that books like the Gospels \nand the letters of Paul were at least as authoritative and at least \nas deserving of Scriptural status as the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarcion controversially tried to cut the Old Testament (and many \nparts of the New Testament which quote it or appear to agree with it) \nout of the Biblebut this means that by his time, the basic shape of \na Bible with two testaments must have been well-established. In the \nmid-first century, Jesus followers were controversially writing new \nbooks and adding them to the Jewish Scriptures. In the mid-second \ncentury, Marcion was taking the old books out of the Christian \nScriptures, which was only possible because no-one doubted the \nscriptural status of the new books.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso in the second century, Irenaeus of Lyon was constructing a \ntheology that assumed the unity of both testaments. His book \nDemonstration of the Apostolic Preaching summarizes the gospel by \npresenting the story of the whole Bible. His very approach assumes \nthe unity of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis evidence shows that from very early, Christians were treating \nthe Bible as a single book.\u0014\n\u0014\nFitting the two testaments in one codex\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if the Bible was already being read as a single book, was it \nbeing physically produced as a single book? The technical name for a \nbook containing the whole Bible is a pandect.\u0014\n\u0014\nPandects were rare in the ancient world, not least because books this \nsize would have been difficult and expensive to produce.\u0014\n\u0014\nPandects were rare in the ancient world, not least because books this \nsize would have been difficult and expensive to produce. We know of \nvery few large books from the ancient world. There is Origens \nHexapla, a copy of the Old Testament containing six different columns \nin multiple Greek translations. We also know of a manuscript \ncontaining all of the ancient Greek epic poem, the Odyssey (which \nruns to about four hundred pages in modern English editions).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to biblical manuscripts, there are four from prior to \n600 AD that were probably originally pandects. They are Codex \nSinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, and Codex Ephraemi \nrescriptus. In the first three, substantial portions of both \ntestaments still survive, so it is very likely they originally \ncontained all of both testaments. In Codex Ephraemi, we have only the \nNew Testament and large parts of the Old Testament wisdom literature. \nHowever, the New Testament and the wisdom literature seems such an \nunusual combination (of which we have no other evidence) that it is \nlikely this manuscript originally contained all the books of both \ntestaments.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese manuscripts all contain the Old Testament in Greek translation \n(often called the Septuagint), since few early Christians could read \nHebrew. They also contain the Old Testament Apocrypha and some \ncontain a few early Christian texts in addition to the New Testament \nbooks (but these are placed after Revelation, which may suggest the \nscribes thought they were in a lesser category).\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther hints from our manuscript evidence\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, many of our early biblical manuscripts are small fragments \nand so it is impossible to know for certain what else they contained. \nOne of our earliest manuscripts, known to biblical scholars as P52, \nis a tiny scrap of Johns Gospel. It is impossible to know what was \nin the original, complete versionall of John, all of the Gospels, \nall of the New Testament, all of the Christian Bible or some more \nunusual combination of texts?\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, some of these early, small fragments include page numbers \nand these generally suggest that they contained only a single \nbiblical book. It is likely therefore that manuscripts of the whole \nBible were rare and the four we know of are not only important but \nunusual.\u0014\n\u0014\nBook technology at the time means that, even with these manuscripts, \nits unlikely all the books of the Bible were physically bound into a \nsingle volume. However the presentation, arrangement of words on the \npage and column layout is the same in each of these manuscripts all \nthrough the Bible, so it is very likely that they were intended to be \nused as single books, rather like a modern book produced in multiple \nvolumes, but always sold together and with such similar font and \nlayout that they are obviously intended to be read as one (such as N. \nT. Wrights Paul and the Faithfulness of God or some editions of The \nLord of the Rings).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe origins of the pandects\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat led to the production of these pandects? As we have seen, the \ntheological belief in the unity of the testaments existed from the \nlate first century, so it is natural that scribes should start \ncreating manuscripts with both testaments, but it is possible there \nwas a specific reason to produce pandects in the early fourth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe early Christian writer, Eusebius, records a letter he received \nfrom the Roman Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, \nrequesting fifty copies of the clearly sacred Scriptures (Life of \nConstantine 4.36). Similarly, another early Christian writer, \nAthanasius, records that he made copies of the divine Scriptures \nfor the Roman Emperor Constans (Defense before Constantius 4).\u0014\n\u0014\nAre these ancient requests for pandects? Scholars disagree at this \npoint. It is possible that fifty copies of the clearly sacred \nScriptures means fifty copies of the Gospels, or even a combination \nlike ten sets each containing five manuscripts, one of the Gospels, \none of the Pentateuch, one of the Psalms, one the Prophets and one of \nthe letters.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there is no indication in the context that this is what \nConstantine or Constans intended and the natural reading of the \ndefinite article in Eusebiuss account is that the clearly sacred \nScriptures includes everything in the category of clearly sacred \nScriptures (just as if one spouse says to another Ill collect the \nchildren from school without further clarification, this means all \ntheir children and only their children). Fifty pandects would \ncertainly be an exorbitant request, but Roman Emperors were hardly \nknown for their modest tastes or restrained demands.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere any of our four surviving pandects produced in response to these \ndemands? It is impossible to be sure.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere any of our four surviving pandects produced in response to these \ndemands? It is impossible to be sure, but Sinaiticus and Vaticanus \nboth probably come from about the right time and Sinaiticus, in \nparticular, probably comes from about the right place. What is even \nmore important than identifying individual manuscripts with \nConstantines or Constanss order, is the simple fact that these \nEmperors were likely commissioning pandects at all. It seems that \nConstantine believed that a well-ordered and united Bible would help \nbuild a well-ordered and united church, which might even help create \na well-ordered and united society.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nThe production of physically united Bibles began in the fourth \ncentury, quite possibly because this was the first time there were \nChristian emperors who could support the production of such large \nbooks. But even more important is the fact that, when these emperors \nrequested such Bibles, the idea made sensebecause Christians had \nbeen trusting and treasuring a unified Bible for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMICHAEL DORMANDY\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael (PhD, University of Cambridge) is a Senior Scientist at the \nInstitute for Biblical Studies and Historical Theology, University of \nInnsbruck, Austria\u0014",

    "words": "ST. ANTHONY IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST \nPOPULAR CATHOLIC SAINTS\u0014\n\u0014\nFERNANDO MARTINS DE BULHES is one of the most popular Catholic \nsaints, although not by that name. His popularity may be either \nbecause his life combined many Christian virtues and attributes, or \nbecause of the miracles attributed to him, or both. In him was \nhumility, simplicity, zeal, generosity, kindness, and spiritual \ndepth. \u0014\n\u0014\nBulhes was born in Lisbon, Portugal, within a short distance of the \ncitys cathedral. His parents were well-to-do, god-fearing people, \nperhaps even nobility. At fifteen, Bulhes sought their permission to \nbecome an Augustinian monk. This was granted and he settled into life \nat the convent of St. Vincent just outside the city. There, for two \nyears, he devoted himself to study, Scripture memorization, and \nprayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding that frequent visits by relatives interrupted his spiritual \ncontemplation, he asked for a transfer to Coimbra. He was there eight \nyears. The burial of several Franciscans martyrs inflamed him with a \ndesire to follow in their steps. He pleaded for permission to \ntransfer to the Franciscan Order and to become a missionary to \nMuslims. Once his transfer was approved, he took the name Anthony. \nEager for martyrdom, he sailed to Morocco. Sickness grounded him all \nwinter. Unable to carry out his mission, he sailed for home. A storm \ndrove his ship to Sicily, where kindly Franciscan monks nurtured him \nback to health.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy May 1220, he had recovered enough strength to attend a general \nchapter (convention) of Franciscans. He met St. Francis who approved \nhis resolution not to return to Portugal. Francis appealed for one of \nthe Italian monasteries to accept Anthony. No one wanted the sickly \nfriar until someone thought of setting him to care for six elderly \nlay brothers at Monte Paolo. In his spare time, he studied Scripture, \nprayed, and meditated.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn March of 1221, Anthony was present for the ordination of some \nfriars at Forli. His superior, Father Gratian, came unprepared to \npreach the customary sermon. He ordered Anthony to take the pulpit \nand speak whatever came into his head, saying the Spirit would guide \nhim. Gratian even assigned the text: Christ became for us obedient \nunto death, even to the death of the cross. Anthony began with a \nshaking voice, but soon his hours of study and prayer asserted \nthemselves. He preached so powerfully that never again would the \nFranciscans allow him to labor in obscurity.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaders dispatched him to preach in many cities. Wherever he went, \nconversions followed. Next to Francis, he became the most famous \nFranciscan preacher. Miracles accompanied his sermons: listeners each \nheard in his or her own language; sick people rose from their beds; \nfish listened to him preach. Niccolo Dal-Gal, writing for the \nCatholic Encyclopedia, said, It may be true that some of the miracles \nattributed to St. Anthony are legendary, but others come to us on \nsuch high authority that it is impossible either to eliminate them or \nexplain them away a priori without doing violence to the facts of \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the last years of his life, Anthony worked in and around Padua. It \nis as Anthony of Padua that we remember him. Never healthy, on this \nday, 13 June 1231, Anthony died in Arcella, Verona, Italy. He had \nbeen on his way back to Padua when illness had forced him to stop at \na convent where sisters tended his dying needs. So great was his \nreputation for holiness and miracles that Pope Gregory IX declared \nhim a saint about a year after his death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "HENRY VIII BEHEADED FISHER, HEAD SHOWN TO ANNE BOLEYN",
    "words": "HENRY VIII BEHEADED JOHN FISHER FOR STANDING ON PRINCIPLE\u0014\n \u0014\nTHIS YEAR also on 17 June was arraigned at Westminster in the kings \nbench John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, for treason against the \nking, wrote Edward Hall, a lawyer who chronicled the reign of King \nHenry VIII. Fishers treason was to deny that the king was Supreme \nHead of the Church of England, a position Parliament had ratified as \nlaw in the Act of Supremacy. Consequently, the Catholic bishop was \ncondemned to be hanged and cut down alive, to have his intestines \ndrawn out of his body and burned before him, to have his head cut off \nand his body divided into four parts to be set in such places as the \nking should choose.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Henry VIII had originally appointed Fisher as Bishop of \nRochester because of his learning, sanctity, and Christian devotion. \nContent with a small diocese, Fisher refused advancement to larger \nsees such as Lincoln and Ely. Afterward he became Chancellor of \nCambridge College, where he revitalized the curriculum and imported \nErasmus from the continent to teach Greek. (Erasmus described Fisher \nas incomparable for uprightness of life, for learning, and for \ngreatness of soul.) As was usual for educated people of the day, \nFisher wrote most of his works in Latin, although a few sermons and \nhis Seven Penitential Psalms are in English.\u0014\n\u0014\nFisher wanted to reform the Catholic Church from within. One of the \nmeans he employed was to send priests throughout the realm preaching \nin English so the common people could understand. However, he wanted \nno part of the Protestant Reformation, rejecting Luthers writings \nand condemning the reformer John Barnes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his own trial he pleaded that his actions and words were not \nmalicious. After an intimidated jury found him guilty, the presiding \njudge asked him if he had anything more to say. He replied, If that \nwhich I have before spoken be not sufficient, I have no more to say, \nbut only to desire God to forgive them that have thus condemned me, \nfor I think they know not what they have done.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Henry pardoned Fisher from the cruelest details of his sentence. \nOn this day, 22 June 1535, he was beheaded without the other \ntortures. Thomas Bailey, Fishers biographer, attributed the \nfollowing last words to him:\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian people, I am come hither to die for the faith of Christs \nholy catholick church and I thank God hitherto my stomach hath served \nme very well thereunto, so that yet I have not feared death: \nwherefore I desire you all to help and assist with your prayers, that \nat the very point and instant of deaths stroke, I may in that very \nmoment stand steadfast, without fainting in any one point of the \ncatholick faith, free from any fear. And I beseech Almighty God, of \nhis infinite goodness to save the king and this realm; and that it \nmay please him to hold his hand over it, and send the king good \ncouncil [sic].\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Fisher had recited two psalms, the executioner covered his \neyes. The condemned man uttered a few short, fervent prayers, then \nstretched his neck on the block. The executioner struck off his head \nwith one blow. Fishers body was dumped unceremoniously into a grave \nnear the Tower of London. His head was shown to Anne Boleyn at her \nrequest, before being parboiled and mounted on a spike on London \nBridge.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE SERPENT IN THE GARDEN BECAME SATAN",
    "words": "How the Serpent in the Garden Became Satan\u0014\nAdam, Eve and the serpent in the Garden of Eden\u0014\nShawna Dolansky  July 18, 2024  \u0014\n\u0014\nIntroduced as the most clever of all of the beasts of the field that \nYHWH God had made, the serpent in the Garden of Eden is portrayed as \njust that: a serpent. Satan does not make an appearance in Genesis \n23, for the simple reason that when the story was written, the \nconcept of the devil had not yet been invented. Explaining the \nserpent in the Garden of Eden as Satan would have been as foreign a \nconcept to the ancient authors of the text as referring to Ezekiels \nvision as a UFO (but Google Ezekiels vision now, and youll see \nthat plenty of people today have made that connection!). In fact, \nwhile the word satan appears elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible/Old \nTestament, it is never a proper name; since there is no devil in \nancient Israels worldview, there cant yet have been a proper name \nfor such a creature.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe noun satan, Hebrew for adversary or accuser, occurs nine \ntimes in the Hebrew Bible: five times to describe a human military, \npolitical or legal opponent, and four times with reference to a \ndivine being. In Numbers 22, the prophet Balaam, hired to curse the \nIsraelites, is stopped by a messenger from Israels God YHWH, \ndescribed as the satan acting on Gods behalf. In Job, the satan \nis a member of Gods heavenly councilone of the divine beings, whose \nrole in Jobs story is to be an accuser, a status acquired by \npeople in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia for the purposes of \nparticular legal proceedings. In Jobs case, whats on trial is Gods \nassertion that Job is completely blameless and upright vs. the \nsatans contention that Job only behaves himself because God has \nrewarded him. God argues that Job is rewarded because he is good, and \nnot good because he is rewarded. The satan challenges God to a wager \nthat if everything is taken away from poor Job, he wont be so good \nanymore, and God accepts. Though a perception of the satan as Satan \nwould make this portrait of God easier to swallow, the story \ndemonstrates otherwise; like Yahwehs messenger in Numbers 22, this \nsatan acts on YHWHs instructions (and as a result of Gods \nbraggadocio) and is not an independent force of evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Zechariah 3, the prophet describes a vision of the high priest \nJoshua standing in a similar divine council, also functioning as a \ntribunal. Before him stand YHWHs messenger and the satan, who is \nthere to accuse him. This vision is Zechariahs way of pronouncing \nYHWHs approval of Joshuas appointment to the high priesthood in the \nface of adversarial community members, represented by the satan. The \nmessenger rebukes the satan and orders that Joshuas dirty clothing \nbe replaced, as he promises Joshua continuing access to the divine \ncouncil. Once again, the satan is not Satan who we read about in the \nNew Testament.\u0014\nThe word satan appears only once without the in front of it in the \nentire Hebrew Bible: in 1 Chronicles 21:1. Is it possible that we \nfinally have Satan here portrayed? 1 Chronicles 21 parallels the \nstory of Davids census in 2 Samuel 24, in which God orders David to \ngo number Israel and Judah and then punishes king and kingdom for \ndoing so. The Chronicler changes this story, as he does others, to \nportray the relationship between God and David as uncompromised; he \nwrites that a satan stood up against Israel and he provoked David to \nnumber Israel (1 Chronicles 21:67; 27:24). Although it is possible \nto read Satan here instead of a satan (Hebrew uses neither \nuppercase letters, nor indefinite articles, e.g., a), nothing else \nin this story or in any texts for another 300 years indicates that \nthe idea of an evil prince of darkness exists in the consciousness of \nthe Israelites.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo if theres no Satan in the Hebrew Bible, how does the serpent in \nthe garden become Satan?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe worldview of Jewish readers of Genesis 23 profoundly changed in \nthe centuries since the story was first written. After the canon of \nthe Hebrew Bible closed,1 beliefs in angels, demons and a final \napocalyptic battle arose in a divided and turbulent Jewish community. \nIn light of this impending end, many turned to a renewed \nunderstanding of the beginning, and the Garden of Eden was \nre-readand re-writtento reflect the changing ideas of a changed \nworld. Two separate things happened and then merged: Satan became the \nproper name of the devil, a supernatural power now seen to oppose God \nas the leader of demons and the forces of evil; and the serpent in \nthe Garden of Eden came to be identified with him. While we begin to \nsee the first idea occurring in texts two centuries before the New \nTestament, the second wont happen until later; the serpent in the \nGarden is not identified with Satan anywhere in the Hebrew Bible or \nNew Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of the devil begins to appear in second and first \ncenturies B.C.E. Jewish texts. In 1 Enoch, the angel who led Eve \nastray and showed the weapons of death to the children of men was \ncalled Gadreel (not Satan). Around the same time, the Wisdom of \nSolomon taught that through the devils envy death entered the \nworld, and those who are on his side suffer it. Though this may very \nwell be the earliest reference to Edens serpent as the devil, in \nneither text, nor in any document we have until after the New \nTestament, is satan clearly understood as the serpent in Eden. At \nQumran, though, Satan is the leader of the forces of darkness; his \npower is said to threaten humanity, and it was believed that \nsalvation would bring the absence of Satan and evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the first century C.E., Satan is adopted into the nascent \nChristian movement, as ruler over a kingdom of darkness, an opponent \nand deceiver of Jesus (Mark 1:13), prince of the devils and opposing \nforce to God (Luke 11:1519; Matthew 12:2427; Mark 3:2223:26); \nJesus ministry puts a temporary end to Satans reign (Luke 10:18) \nand the conversion of the gentiles leads them from Satan to God (Acts \n26:18). Most famously, Satan endangers the Christian communities but \nwill fall in Christs final act of salvation, described in detail in \nthe book of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut curiously, although the author of Revelation describes Satan as \nthe ancient serpent (Revelation 12:9; 20:2), there is no clear link \nanywhere in the Bible between Satan and the serpent in the garden. \nThe ancient Near Eastern combat myth motif, exemplified in the battle \nbetween Marduk and Tiamat in Enuma Elish and Baal and Yam/Mot in \nancient Canaan, typically depicted the bad guy as a serpent. The \ncharacterization of Leviathan in Isaiah 27 reflects such myths nicely:\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that day YHWH will punish\u0014\nWith his hard and big and strong sword\u0014\nLeviathan the fleeing serpent,\u0014\nLeviathan the twisted serpent,\u0014\nAnd he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the reference in Revelation 12:9 to Satan as the ancient serpent \nprobably reflects mythical monsters like Leviathan rather than the \nclever, legged, talking creature in Eden.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the New Testament, Satan and his demons have the power to enter \nand possess people; this is what is said to have happened to Judas \n(Luke 22:3; John 13:27; cf. Mark 5:1213; Luke 8:3032). But when \nPaul re-tells the story of Adam and Eve, he places the blame on the \nhumans (Romans 5:18; cf. 1 Corinthians 15:2122) and not on fallen \nangels, or on the serpent as Satan. Still, the conflation begged to \nbe made, and it will seem natural for later Christian authorsJustin \nMartyr, Tertullian, Cyprian, Irenaeus and Augustine, for exampleto \nassume Satans association with Edens talking snake. Most famously, \nin the 17th century, John Milton elaborates Satans role in the \nGarden poetically, in great detail in Paradise Lost. But this \nconnection is not forged anywhere in the Bible.\u0014\n________________________________________\u0014\nShawna Dolansky is Adjunct Research Professor and Instructor in the \nprogram in Religion at the College of Humanities, Carleton University \nin Ottawa, Ontario.

    "words": "Holy Pagans\u0014\n\u0014\nCould a person be saved without an explicit knowledge of Christ? \nAmong the Stockbridge Indians, Jonathan Edwards began to entertain \nthe possibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Gerald R. McDermott\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the Massachusetts frontier in April 1753, a famous preacher, known \nfor his belief in an angry and highly selective God, sat in his \nStockbridge study, writing a letter. In it, he described his \nneighbors, a group of unconverted Indians, as excelling \"in religion \nand virtue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprising? This doesn't fit the stereotype of the preacher, Jonathan \nEdwards. But during this period, Edwards was assembling a \"Catalogue\" \nof hundreds of notebook pages filled with evidence that pagans had \nreceived knowledge about God the Redeemer both from the Jews and from \ntraditions going back to Noah's sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhence this open-mindedness toward those who had not heard the name \nof Christ? The explanation starts with the fifteenth- and \nsixteenth-century explorers of the East and the New World, who had \ndiscovered not just spices and trade routes but also \"heathen\" who \nexhibited better morals than most European Christ-ians.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards vs. the monstrous God\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventeenth-century geographers estimated that only one-sixth of the \nplanet had heard the gospel, so, according to hyper-Calvinists of the \nday, at least five-sixths of the world's population was doomed to \nhell.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning with Lord Herbert of Cherbury, the deists, those \nself-appointed guardians of a reasonable religion, suggested that the \nCalvinist god responsible for this scenario was a monster. These \ndeists succeeded at popularizing the disjunction between the heathen \nwho were damned but morally good and the Christians who were saved \nbut morally bad.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards, disturbed by deist use of non-Christian religions to attack \nGod's goodness and justice, worked hard to learn about these \nreligions. He sought out and read travelogues, dictionaries, and \nencyclopedias of religion available in his time. The books cited in \nhis \"Catalogue\" include George Sale's translation of the Qur'an, \nreports of the Jesuits in China, an analysis of the Qabbalah, \ncomparative mythology, and a wide range of reference worksfrom \nskeptic Peter Bayle's Historical and Critical Dictionary to Daniel \nDefoe's Dictionary of All Religions Ancient and Modern.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards developed three strategies to defend Reformed orthodoxy \nagainst deist charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, he used the idea of a prisca theologia (ancient theology) to \ntry to prove that vestiges of true religion were taught by the Greeks \nand other non-Christian traditions. Therefore, he concluded, \nfive-sixths of the world had not been deprived of the basic truths of \nthe gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, he developed an elaborate typological system to show that God \nis constantly communicating Reformed truths wherever the eye can see \nand the ear can hearin nature, history, and even the history of \nreligions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Edwards taught that an inner \"disposition\" is better \nevidence of regeneration than precision in belief. He described the \nnecessary disposition as \"a sense of the dangerousness of sin, and of \nthe dreadfulness of God's anger  [such a conviction of] their \nwickedness, that they trusted to nothing but the mere mercy of God, \nand then bitterly lamented and mourned for their sins.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, some people can be regenerated before explicit conversion \nto Christ: elect infants, Old Testament saints, and New Testament \nsaints (such as Cornelius before he heard the gospel from Peter, \nNathaniel, \"probably\" John's two disciples, and several others who \nwere \"good men before [they met Christ]\"). In all these cases, \n\"conversion may still be by divine constitution necessary to \nsalvation in some respect even after [a person] is really a saint.\"\u0014\nThe un-churched saved\u0014\n\u0014\nA fourth class of people who Edwards thought enjoyed salvation \nwithout explicit knowledge of Christ were those we might call holy \npagans.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 1739 sermons on the history of the work of redemption, Edwards \nsurmised that conversion to true religion, justification, and \nglorification have occurred in all ages of the world since the Fall. \nHe cited examples of such holy pagans living outside of Israel: \nMelchizedek, the posterity of Nahor (Job and his family), Job's three \nfriends, and Elihu. These were individuals outside the national \ncovenant with Israel, and of course without explicit knowledge of \nChrist, who nonetheless seem to have been regenerate.\u0014\nVirtue among \"the devil's captives\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn correspondence during his last years, Edwards wrote of a group of \nOnohquaga Indians from the Susquehanna River Valley as excelling \"in \nreligion and virtue\" and \"far the best disposed Indians we have had \nto do with, and [who] would be inclined to their utmost to assist, \nencourage, and to strengthen the hands of missionaries and \ninstructors, should [any] be sent among [them].\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe letters do not claim that these Indians were converted. But it is \nsignificant that Edwards said they excelled in both religion and \nvirtue. In his sermons and private notebooks he criticized pagan \nmoralists who sometimes had good ideas about religion and virtue but \nfailed to live virtuous or religious lives. Yet Edwards praised these \nIndians not for the truth of their ideas but the quality of their \nlives, just as Luke had commended Cornelius for the quality of his \npractice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another letter during that period, Edwards wrote that \"many\" \nmembers of that tribe \"that used to be notorious drunkards and \nblood-thirsty warriors, have of late strangely had their dispositions \n[my emphasis] and manners changed through some wonderful influence on \ntheir minds.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards had only contempt for Native American religion and referred \nto Indians generally as \"the devil's captives.\" But he seemed deeply \nmoved by the uncivilized natives at Stockbridge who showed more \ncivility and virtue than the educated English \"saints\" who had thrown \nhim out of Northampton.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in his tenure at Stockbridge, he boasted to his father that \n\"the Indians seem much pleased with my family, especially my wife.\" \nLater he referred to them warmly as \"my people\" and noted happily \nthat \"they steadfastly adhere to me\" despite his enemies' efforts to \nalienate them from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne would never guess this from Edwards's learned treatises or most \nof his public statements about Indian religion, but his private \ncorrespondence and notebooks suggest that in his last decade, while \nin exile, the great theologian might have concluded that he had found \nholy pagans who, like Cornelius, were sincerely seeking the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nGerald R. McDermott teaches religion at Roanoke College in Virginia.\u0014",

    "words": "While visiting his sister, the Chinese Emperor Wu spotted a handsome \nhousehold slave, Wei Qing. Smitten by the beauty of the young man, \nthe emperor brought him back to his palace, took him as his lover, \nand eventually made Wei a general. Years later, by the emperors \norder, both men were buried together in the same tomb.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world is full of stories of same sex romance. What sets Wu and \nWeis story apart is that no one in ancient China thought there was \nanything remarkable about two menor two women, for that \nmattercoming together.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Homosexuality & Civilization, Louis Crompton travels around the \nglobe and covers 2,500 years of human history to reveal how various \nsocieties have regarded same sex attraction. This book charts what \nCrompton describes as homosexualitys rich and terrible past. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sacred Band\u0014\n\u0014\nCrompton begins his story with the ancient Greeks who associated male \nlove with the courage of comrades in battle and the mature \nphilosophers mentorship of a younger man. The ancient city-state of \nThebes, for example, had their Sacred Band, an army composed entirely \nof pairs of lovers. The army was virtually undefeatable because each \nman would rather have died than disgrace himself in the eyes of his \nbeloved. It took a concerted effort by Philip of Macedonia, Alexander \nthe Greats father, to wipe out the Sacred Band in 338 BCE. But the \ngiant marble lion monument erected in ancient times as their memorial \nstill stands, restored in 1902 by a society of English homosexuals.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking farther afield, Crompton finds Mandarins of China pairing up \nwith stars of the opera, while in Japan man-on-man love was as common \namong Buddhist saints as it was among samurai warriors. \u0014\n\u0014\nLess happy is the history of same sex lovers in Europe. Crompton \ncites many gruesome examples of the penalties inflicted on gay men \nand women. But he also brings out a very interesting point when \ndescribing the Renaissance. The same civil and ecclesiastical \nauthorities who hunted down gay men did not object (or perhaps did \nnot recognize) when artists such as Donatello and Botticelli included \nhomoerotic images in their paintings and sculpture.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemarkable by any standard\u0014\n\u0014\nCrompton doesnt miss any opportunity to spotlight gay men and \nlesbians whose achievements were remarkable by anyones standards: \nLeonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Christopher Marlowe, Francis Bacon, \nQueen Christina, Thomas Gray, Frederick the Great But the real point \nof his book is larger. Rather than give readers an encyclopedia of \nhomosexual heroes, he has written a detailed, nuanced history of the \ncivilizations of East and West, and how homosexuality has been \nperceived and judged at different times in different cultures. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: Louis Crompton is Emeritus Professor of English at \nthe University of Nebraska.\u0014",

The first is \nsinful worship; the third is a whole list of personal and relational \nsins. It is important to note that Paul is using homosexual practices \nto indicate the extent to which sin has brought chaos into every area \nof life. Homosexuality (to exchange or abandon natural relations of \nsex) was as widespread in Paul's day as it is in ours. Many pagan \npractices encouraged it.

In our own times we have seen a belittling of God \nas no more than a pale extension of our wishful thinking, someone \nmade in our image.

God does not usually stop us from \nmaking choices against his will. He lets us declare our supposed \nindependence from him, even though he knows that in time we will \nbecome slaves to our own rebellious choices--we will lose our freedom \nnot to sin.

    "title": "HOW TO RUN A GREAT STAFF MEETING",
    "words": "Leadership Journal, Winter 2004\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             How to Run a Great Staff \nMeeting\u0014\nThe \"best practices\" of ministry include keeping the key people in \ntouch.\u0014\nJohn Sommerville\u0014\n\u0014\nAre staff meetings really necessary? Some pastors have told us that \nthey consider them a waste of time (\"There's only the three of us, \nand the other two are part-time. Aren't hallway conversations \nenough?\"). Others confess that they consider staff meetings a burden \n(\"It feels like one more event I have to plan\") or even a source of \ndread (\"I always come away with more on my to-do list\"). Still others \nadmit they used to have weekly meetings but stopped because of \nresistance and apathy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe decided to see how staff meetings are run at one of the best-led \nchurches in America, Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.\u0014\n\u0014\nA thoughtfully conceived, well-run staff meeting will improve the \neffectiveness of ministry in virtually any church. Moreover, great \nstaff meetings are not hard to achieve. For more than 25 years, \nseveral important disciplines have made weekly staff meetings \nworthwhile at Wooddale Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy meet?\u0014\nMany churches struggle with \"ministry silos\"uncoordinated ministries \noperating within the church but unrelated and disconnected from each \nother. Regular staff meetings facilitate communication and \ncoordination among these ministries and build a sense of team. The \ntime together allows each ministry leader to discuss challenges and \nopportunities and benefit from the collective wisdom of the entire \nteam. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese meetings fortify the common purpose and activities of the \nchurch and become a time to reinforce values, clarify priorities, and \nsupport one another. Without a regular time to interact, staff teams \ntend to fragment. Coordination and teamwork become more difficult. \u0014\n\u0014\nWho comes?\u0014\nSome consultants suggest limiting meetings to only those who have to \nbe there. Others suggest that the number of participants be no more \nthan ten. At Wooddale, we expect all 17 staff pastors to participate \nin each week's meeting. In smaller churches, it may be helpful to \ninclude ministry directors or part-timers and volunteers who are \nresponsible for significant ministries, which allows for adequate \nrepresentation of the breadth of the church's ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen those responsible for key ministry areas are not in the meeting, \ncommunication and coordination suffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat makes a great meeting?\u0014\nGenerally, each week we focus on one or two specific ministries (in \naddition to the repeating staff business), which allows for variety \nas well as covering the necessary recurring details.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur staff meetings always begin with 10 to 20 minutes of prayer, \nthough the time can vary as the needs of the day dictate. We'll pray \nabout ministry issues and upcoming church events, as well as \nindividual needs within the staff and church. The format varies, at \ntimes with directed prayer around a specific need or theme. Prayer \nmay also take place at other times in the agenda, especially when we \nneed wisdom for a specific area.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, a number of items are a part of every staff meeting. Here's our \nrepeating agenda:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst-time visitors and new regular attenders: Reviewing reports of \ncalls to first-time visitors and new regular attenders allows us to \ntrack newcomers' reactions to services and ministries, to flag items \nfor follow-up, and to be aware of any emerging trends. \u0014\n\u0014\nProgram inserts/display ads and public announcements: To coordinate \ncommunication efforts and establish priorities, we discuss the items \nscheduled to appear as either inserts or ads in the worship program \nor included in the list of public announcements made during services.\u0014\n\u0014\nFuture dates: Before adding any new ministry event to the calendar, \nwe review and discuss the merits of the idea and try to minimize \nscheduling conflicts. \u0014\n\u0014\nName clearing: We review all potential ministry leaders before they \nare offered a specific ministry position. This allows the head of a \nparticular ministry to benefit from the collective wisdom of the full \nteam about the skills and character of the potential leader. It also \nhelps prevent burnout of a volunteer who may already be involved in \nother ministry areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeekend review: Time is allocated to discuss the weekend's worship \nservices and special events. We try to affirm what went well and to \nidentify what could have been improved. \u0014\n\u0014\nCurrent projects: We monitor the development of a priority ministry, \nsuch as a new church start, staff search, or capital campaign. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNext comes what we call priority business, listed in three categories:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. General discussion. Issues about which staff must be informed, and \nreminders of upcoming priorities. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Proposals. We review the development of new ministry ideas and \nplans for addressing problem areas. Each idea or problem is assigned \nto a specific staff person, and a date is designated for the staff \nmember to present a report. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Deferred matters. Any items that were previously tabled. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen comes new business: If an issue surfaces during the staff \nmeeting and needs attention, it is listed under new business. If time \nallows, this item could be discussed immediately, tabled, or assigned \nto a staff member or team for study. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the meeting concludes with reports, an opportunity for staff \nmembers to offer a ministry update, new ideas, or anything else that \nmight be of interest to the entire team. This can be just a few \nminutes or an extended time, depending on the time available. \u0014\n\u0014\nGround rules\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have several principles for effective staff meetings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave a regular time and place (and don't cancel!). The discipline of \nmeeting each and every week at the same time, even if the meeting is \nabbreviated, builds a pattern that reaps long-term benefits. Most \nstaff teams find it best to meet early in the week. We meet at 8 A.M. \non Monday. (If you are wiped out from the weekend, why not be paid \nfor it!) We expect all staff to be there. Allowing staff to skip at \ntheir discretion will undermine the meeting's effectiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\nStart (and end) on time. Starting late is disrespectful to those who \nhave made it a priority to be on time. Soon those who are prompt will \nstart coming late, and then the first ten minutes of the meeting are \nspent waiting or rounding up the participants. The discipline of the \nend time moves the meeting along and allows people to plan the rest \nof their day with confidence. We end by 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave an agenda and stick to it (most of the time). Most meetings fail \nwhen adequate thought has not been put into what the group should \ndiscuss. Place priority items at the top, not the bottom, of the \nagenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe prepared. Those with assignments must come prepared. If this \ndiscipline breaks down, participants begin to consider preparation \noptional. At Wooddale, preparation includes a weekly report from each \npastor. These reports are circulated in advance of the meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave an established leader. Consistent leadership enhances the \neffectiveness of the meeting. At Wooddale, the senior pastor leads \nthe meeting, but that doesn't have to be the case. At some churches, \nthe leadership of the staff meeting is delegated to another pastor \nskilled at meeting management. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf possible, decide. Meetings lose their usefulness if the \nparticipants discover that process, not action, is the primary \nactivity. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaintain task orientation (with human sensitivity). The meeting must \nmove briskly through the agenda, but with sensitivity to the \nrelational dynamics. Build a sense of team around the task of \nministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nBe realistic. Groups generally have energy for one or two significant \nissues in any one meeting. It is best to avoid the temptation to add \ntoo many agenda items besides the routine business. \u0014\n\u0014\nSet aside additional time for experiences and long-term thinking. \nWeekly meetings alone will not be sufficient to address all the \nissues. On occasion, time must be set aside for brainstorming, \nplanning, and for experiences designed to build community, \nperspective, and skills. At Wooddale, we have six annual retreat \ndays. These include a planning day with the church board, a family \nretreat, and four days for planning and staff development \nexperiences. One retreat day we spent an afternoon racing go-karts! \u0014\n\u0014\nKeep confidentiality. When discussing volatile issues, particularly \nrelated to people within the church, the conversation must not leave \nthe room. When a difficult issue surfaces, it's often wise to table \nthe discussion until later and include only those directly involved. \u0014\n\u0014\nBe unified. At times it's impossible to have complete agreement, but \nit is important that, once a decision is reached, the staff not air \nany differences elsewhere. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Sommerville is executive director of Wooddale Center and on the \nstaff of Wooddale Church, Eden Prairie, Minnesota.\u0014",

    "words": "Henlee Barnette: Giant in the Land\u0014\n\u0014\nRon Sisk\u0014\n08-26-02 \u0014\n\u0014\nInto his 10th decade now, Baptist ethicist, author and preacher \nHenlee Barnette continues his unflinching call to Christian integrity \nin thought and action. His career spans seven decades of Baptist \nhistory in the South. From the time of his conversion as a teen-ager \nfrom the cotton mills of Kannapolis, N.C., Barnette has brought to \nthe task of ethics both his strong biblical faith and his willingness \nto examine honestly any issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis career as an activist began with a seminary chapel at Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, and a call by the Baptist \nprophet Clarence Jordan to minister to Louisvilles Haymarket \ndistrict of flophouses, tenements and bordellos. With Walter \nRauschenbuschs social gospel as a guiding light, Barnette spent \nyears as pastor and friend to that blighted neighborhood, earning the \nnickname Bishop of the Haymarket. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Baptist professor of religion in the 40s, he found himself \nconfronted with the quintessential Southern issue of racism. In the \nactivist spirit that would characterize all his work, he began to \nsearch for things he could practically do. While a professor at \nHoward College (Samford University), he was instrumental in founding \nthe Interracial Ministerial Association in Birmingham. After \nreturning to Southern as professor of Christian ethics, Barnette \nmarched for fair housing in the city of Louisville and invited the \nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to campus. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe has always been in trouble. Friends long ago gave him a pair of \nasbestos gloves to use in opening his mail from outraged Baptists. In \nevery issue though, Barnette searches for a way to bring the biblical \nprinciple of love to bear in concrete ways. He describes himself as \nan SCO, a selective conscientious objector. \u0014\n\u0014\nI reserve the right, he says, to decide which wars I will support \nand which I will not.\u0014\nDuring the Vietnam conflict, he found himself forced to re-examine \nhis convictions in a particularly personal way. Of his two young \nadult sons, one became a bomber pilot in Vietnam and the other fled \nto Sweden as a conscientious objector. Asked which of his sons he \nsupported, Barnette always replied, I support them both. Each is \ndoing what his conscience under God leads him to do. No father, he \nbelieved, could ask for more. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with his second wife, the late Helen Poarch Barnette, he \nchampioned the role of women in Baptist life. Describing their \nmarriage as a coarchya partnership of equalsBarnette found ample \nbiblical evidence for the freedom of Christian women to assert both \nrelational and spiritual equality with men. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn accomplished author, Barnette has always written about ethics with \na Southern Baptist audience in mind. His text Introducing Christian \nEthics served for many years as a standard for those taking their \nfirst venture into the field. From ecology in the 70s to biomedical \nethics in the 80s and 90s, he applied his voracious curiosity to \nresearching and writing on ethical topics.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis method is both simple and sophisticated. He seeks the best \npossible scientific input. He never flinches from the facts. As an \nacademician his first task is to understand. But then, as a \ntheologian, he searches for and applies relevant biblical principles. \nAnd as an activist Christian he seeks the leadership of the Holy \nSpirit to discover what can actually be done.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften hes paid a price for his candor. Retired at age 65 by a \nseminary administration weary of his ethical forthrightness, Barnette \nfound a home in the University of Louisville Medical School where he \ncontinued and expanded his research in biomedical ethics. Later \nbrought back into favor at the seminary by a friendlier \nadministration, and then once again alienated by the fundamentalist \ntakeover, Barnette never missed a beat.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, he continues his work from the same little white house next \ndoor to the seminary where he raised four children and generations of \nconservative hackles. His ethical interests remain catholic in their \ninclusivity. He maintains a lively interest in local and national \npolitics. His letters to the editor, often about the evils of \nfundamentalism, appear frequently in Kentucky Baptists Western \nRecorder. \u0014\nAt noon on the first Thursday of every month he hosts a luncheon \ncalled Barnettes Buddies, where Louisvillians gather to discuss \ntopics of interest in Baptist life and beyond. In an article written \nfor Baptists Today just this summer, Barnette dealt with the issue of \na Christian response to terrorism. Outthink them! and Outlove \nthem! were two of his pithy and salient conclusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a graduate student at Southern in the early 80s, I wrote a \ndissertation on the career and ethical method of Henlee Barnette. I \nsought to sum up and characterize his work. Silly me. I seem to have \nbeen at least a quarter of a century too early. But I can say this: \nAs long as we have Henlee Barnette among us, faithful Baptists have \nan articulate advocate and friend. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe need not fear those who would force us into an intellectual or \nethical box. We have a giant in the land. \u0014\n\u0014\nRon Sisk is professor of homiletics and Christian ministry at North \nAmerican Baptist Seminary in Sioux Falls, S.D.\u0014",

    "title": "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL",
    "words": "Was the phrase \"he descended into hell\" always part of the Apostles' \nCreed, or was it introduced later? And how have Christians \ninterpreted it over time?\u0014\n\u0014\nBruno\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' purported descent into hell has long been the subject of \ndisagreement between Christians. Its presence in the Apostles' Creed \npoints to a long-standing, lively, and ultimately inconclusive \ndiscussion on the theme of Jesus' post-crucifixion activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians first recited the Creed not as a statement of belief, but \nas a baptismal confession. Much as liturgical churches now pose \nquestions in confirmation ceremonies, the ancient churches asked \ncandidates for baptism three questions about the Trinity. From this \ncame the Apostles' \"Symbol\" or \"sign\" identifying with the community \nin baptismand eventually the Creed in its current wording.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Creed, then, was not set from its beginning, but fluid. The \noldest extant version comes from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (ca. A.D. \n337), and it does not contain the clause about descending into hell. \nScholars call this version \"The Old Roman Form\"the earliest creed of \nthe Roman church.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently the clause first appeared in the East with Sirmium's \nfourth formula in 359also called the \"Dated Creed\" though the \nEastern church rejected it as tinged with Arianism. The first mention \nof the descent in the West occurs in the writings of Rufinus of \nAquileia, who included it in his baptismal creed around 400. Over \ntime, the Latin church appropriated it as well, officially \nintegrating it into the Creed in 750.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have long been troubled over what the descent actually \nmeans. Augustine, for example, believed Christ literally descended \ninto hell. But in his letter to Evodius, he admits several \nuncertainties over the meaning of 1 Peter 3:19, which says that Jesus \npreached to those \"spirits in prison\" who had been disobedient in \nNoah's day. If \"prison\" equals \"hell,\" then why, Augustine wonders, \nshould these people be singled out for such an honor, and who, if \nanyone, did Christ save with his preaching in hell? Further, Jesus \ncould not have come only to take the \"righteous men\" from hell, for \nwere they not already separated from the condemned, as demonstrated \nin the story of the beggar Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16? \nAugustine does not attempt to resolve the matter, but openly admits \nhis perplexity.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies later, Thomas Aquinas resolved Augustine's problem by \nsaying Christ descended to two placeshell and purgatoryand that his \npurpose in each was different. In hell, he put unbelievers to shame, \nwhile in purgatory, he gave sinners hope for glory and the righteous \ndeliverance. But this explanation did not satisfy all. Martin Luther, \nthough he believed Christ descended to hell, would offer no clear cut \nexplanation for the event. John Calvin went so far as to describe the \ndescent as symbolic, pointing to Christ's suffering at Gethsemane and \nthe cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the debate continued. Nineteenth-century church historian Philip \nSchaff deemed the translation \"descended into hell\" unfortunate and \nmisleading. \"We do not know whether Christ was in hell,\" he wrote, \n\"but we do know from His own lips that He was in Paradise between His \ndeath and resurrection. The term Hades is much more comprehensive \nthan Hell (Gehenna) which is confined to the state of the lost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly there are unacceptable readings, such as preacher Kenneth \nCopeland's claim that it was Jesus' descent to hell, not his death on \nthe cross, that redeemed sinners. But most proposed solutions have \nlittle bearing on the essentials of Christian faith. Such puzzles \nwill always be with us, providing fodder for speculation and debate, \nbut admitting of no definitive solution this side of heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n* For a concise overview of the historic development of the Creed and \nthe doctrine of the descent, look up \"Apostle's Creed\" and \"Harrowing \nof Hell\" in the Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, 2nd ed.(Garland, \n1997). Also, consult the entry \"Descent into Hell\" in the \nEncyclopedia of the Early Church (Oxford University Press, 1992).\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Gertz is editorial coordinator for Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine\u0014",

If Christ has not risen, we have no proof that \nthe crucifixion of Jesus differed from that of the two thieves who \nsuffered with him.

    "title": "HE COULD SEE FOR MILES",
    "words": "He Could See for Miles\u0014\nReagan had a vision and the courage to endure all the doubters\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made Ronald Reagan the greatest President of the second half of \nthe 20th century? Well, he certainly had the one quality Napoleon \nalways sought in a general: luck. Luck in his looks, luck in his \nvoice, luck in his smile, luck in his choice of mate (although for \nReagan the second time was the charm).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the greatest luck that any President can have: trouble, serious \ntrouble. An acquaintance of Bill Clinton's has said that he felt \nfrustrated that Sept. 11 did not happen on his watch. That is \nunderstandable (if characteristically self-centered) because the best \nchance any President has for greatness is to be in power during war \nor disaster. Apart from the Founders, the only great President we \nhave had in good times is Theodore Roosevelt. Abraham Lincoln and \nFranklin Roosevelt were the \"luckiest\" of them all, having had the \nopportunity to take the country triumphantly through the two greatest \nwars in U.S. history.\u0014\n\u0014\nReagan's luck was to find a nation in trouble  in post-Vietnam \nretreat and disorientation. His political genius was to restore its \nspirit. And his legacy was winning the longest war in American \nhistory, the long twilight struggle of the cold war.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe achieved all that with two qualities: courage and conviction. \nConviction led him to initiate economic shock therapy to pull the \nU.S. out of the stagflation of the 1970s. Courage allowed him not to \nflinch when his radical economic policies (and those of a merciless \nFederal Reserve) initially caused the worst recession since the Great \nDepression  and during a congressional election year (1982) to boot.\u0014\n\u0014\nReagan didn't waver, and by 1984 it was morning in America. The new \nprosperity gave a lilt to the rest of his presidency. But you don't \nget called great for lilt. You get called great for victory. And \nReagan won the cold war.\u0014\n\u0014\nConviction told him that the proper way to deal with this endless, \nenervating, anxiety-ridden ordeal was not settling for stability but \ngoing for victory. Courage allowed him to weather the incessant, at \ntimes almost universal, attacks on him for the radical means he chose \nto win it: the military buildup; nuclear deployments in Europe; the \nReagan doctrine of overt support for anticommunist resistance \nmovements everywhere, including Nicaragua; and the piece de \nresistance, strategic missile defenses, derisively dubbed Star Wars \nby scandalized opponents. Within eight years, an overmatched, \noverwhelmed, overstretched Soviet Union was ready for surrender, the \nhistorically breathtaking, total and peaceful surrender of everything \n its empire and its state.\u0014\n\u0014\nReagan won that war not just with radical policies but also with a \nradically unashamed ideological challenge, the great 1982 Westminster \nspeech predicting that communism would end up in the \"ash heap of \nhistory\" and the subsequent designation of the Soviet Union as the \n\"evil empire.\" That won him the derision of Western sophisticates, \nintellectuals and defeatists of all kinds. It also won him the \nundying admiration of liberation heroes from Vaclav Havel to Natan \nSharansky. Rarely does history render such decisive verdicts: Reagan \nwas right, his critics were wrong. Less than a year after he left \noffice, the Berlin Wall came down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ungenerous would say he had a great presidency but was not a \ngreat man. That follows the tradition of his opponents who throughout \nhis career consistently underestimated him, disdaining him as a good \nactor, a Being There simpleton who could read scripts written for him \nby others. In fact, Reagan frustrated his biographers because he was \nso complex  a free-market egalitarian, an intellectually serious \nnonintellectual, an ideologue with great tactical flexibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the years, the shallow explanations for Reagan's success  \ncharm, acting, oratory  have fallen away. What remains is Reagan's \nlargeness and deeply enduring significance. Let Edward Kennedy, the \ndean of Democratic liberalism, render the verdict: \"It would be \nfoolish to deny that his success was fundamentally rooted in a \ncommand of public ideas ... Whether we agreed with him or not, Ronald \nReagan was a successful candidate and an effective President above \nall else because he stood for a set of ideas. He stated them in 1980 \n and it turned out that he meant them  and he wrote most of them \nnot only into public law but into the national consciousness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no better definition of presidential greatness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Time Inc.

Farnsworth was a farm boy who conceived the basic operating \nprinciples of electronic television at the age of just 13 years. \nDespite his humble beginnings, this daring young dreamer persevered \nuntil his dreams became reality, and his work has touched the lives \nof every man, woman and child alive today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1920s Philo Farnsworth was working on a farm, plowing a \u0014\nstraight line on a potato farm. His mind was far away, thinking about \nthe \u0014\npossibility of transmitting moving pictures through the air. He had \nno \u0014\nelectronic or engineering background, nor was he a scientist. No one \nin the \u0014\nworld of science would have considered him a serious contender in the \nchase \u0014\nto find the answer to photographic transmission without the aid of \nwires. \u0014\nScientists from all over the world had been struggling to solve this \ndilemma \u0014\nand although many had been aided by research grants, no one came up \nwith the \u0014\nanswer. So, what chance did Farnsworth, a potato farmer with no \neducation, \u0014\nhave? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile plowing, he imagined a different approach. He imagined dividing \na \u0014\nscreen into long rows just like the field he was plowing, using \nelectricity \u0014\nto create areas of light and darkness at each point along the row. \nThen \u0014\nstacking the rows on top of each other, he imagined that they could \nbring to \u0014\nfocus a picture. Bingo! The results were better than anything the \nworld of \u0014\nscience had ever conceived. It is the very system used today in a \nstandard \u0014\ntelevision.\u0014",

    "words": "It's a quiet catastrophe that's rarely reported, yet child hunger is \na problem we can solve together. \u0014\n\u0014\nPARADE (April 4, 2004) Contributing Editor David Oliver Relin spent \nmonths traveling across the country, visiting families in the \nneediest communities. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's what he saw.\u0014\n\u0014\nIN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY, ONLY a few miles from the gaudy new homes \nthat people here call \"McMansions,\" sprawl some of America's poorest \nneighborhoods. Shantytowns known as \"colonias\" are as common in this \npart of South Texas as fields of cabbage and sugarcane. More than \n500,000 people live in the area's 1500 unincorporated communities, \nwhere running water is scarce, electricity is a luxury and one in \nevery two children endures hunger.\u0014\n\u0014\nDulce Cornpean, 23, and her husband lsmael, 30, live in the Southside \ncolonia, 10 miles southeast of the prosperous cross-border banking \ncenter of McAllen, with their Sons Eduardo, 7, Edgar, 6, Ismael Jr., \n4, and Ibrayn, 2.\u0014\n\u0014\nDulce stares at a saucepan of beans simmering on her stove and tries \nto imagine how she can stretch this meal to feed her family. She \ndecides to use half of her last loaf of white bread. The Compeans \nwork hard, but like millions of families mired with low-wage jobs, \nthey live below the poverty line. When she can, Dulce cleans houses. \nHer husband does temporary construction jobs and, after work, \ncollects cardboard to recycle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Compeans receive $300 in food stamps a month, but Dulce says it's \na struggle no matter how careful she is. \"I'm not ashamed to tell you \nthat often I don't eat so there will be enough for my children,\" she \nsays.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                     \nTurning away families\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, arcording to the Department of Agriculture, 34.9 million \nAmericans like the Cornpeans were \"food insecure\"the government's \nterm for those who must survive on a diet not nutritious enough to \nkeep a child healthy. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 13 million of those people were children. The U.S. \nConference of Mayors expects that requests for emergency food from \nfamilies with children will increase in 91% of the nation's cities \nthis year. They also document that emergency food outlets in 56% of \nthe nation's cities turned away hungry families last year because \nthey ran out of resources.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederal programs such as food stamps and free school lunches provide \ncritical nutrition to millions of children. And an army of volunteers \nat food banks, church pantries and soup kitchens is struggling to get \nfood to the children who need it most. But the safety net that most \nAmericans presume is there to catch children before they sink too far \nis torn in too many places, leaving far too many in free fall.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Food is a basic right for every American child,\" says Bill Shore, \nexecutive director of Share Our Strength, the anti-hunger \norganization that works with PARADE and other partners to sponsor the \nannual Great American Bake SaleTM . \"This is the wealthiest nation on \nearth, and we have the resources to wipe out child hunger in our \ntime. All it takes is the political will to make the welfare of \nchildren one of our nation's top priorities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first step is corning to terms with the shattering effet the \nunstable economy has had on families. \"In spite of recent reports \nthat the economy has rebounded, our pantries and soup kitchens are \ntrying to serve a surging number of families,\" says Robert Forney, \npresident and CEO of America's Second Harvest, a network of more than \n200 regional food banks. Second Harvest distributed nearly 2 billion \npounds of food last year to more than 23 million hungry Americans, \nincluding 9 million children.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Millions of people have used up their unemployment insurance \nbenefits, spent their savings, sold off their assets and come to us \nbecause they have no way to feed their families,\" Forney explains.\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                       \nFrom everything to nothing\u0014\n\u0014\nOregon has one of the nation's highest rates of child hunger. A \nquarter of the state's children face food insecurity. At the \nCrossroads Cupboard in Portland, a parade of formerly middle- class \nfamilies, including Alesia Hamilton, 28, and her son Derrick, 7, \nappear stunned that they have to appeal to a charity for help feeding \ntheir children.\u0014\n\u0014\nSandra Mallet, 42, has come with her son Matthew, 11, to pick up \nemergency food for the first time in her life. Mailer worked as a \ncomputer specialist for the U.S. Forest Service for 20 years, quit \nbecause of family problems, then was laid off from an administrative \nassistant job when the economy slid south. \"We don't have health \ninsurance anymore,\" she says. \"One more bad turn, and I don't know \nwhat we'll do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMailer stares down at a paper bag containing cans of tuna, boxes of \ncereal and a big jar of peanut butter. \"I never thought I'd be \nstanding here,\" she says. \"It kind of makes you feel depressed and \nworthless. But I have to do whatever it takes to feed Matthew.\" She \nsays her son refuses to eat the cheap meals of milk and powdered \nmashed potatoes that she's been forced to serve, and he's started \nacting up at school. Authorities have insisted that he attend anger- \nmanagement classes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We had everything once,\" Mailer says. \"Now we have to start over \nfrom nothing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                         Under the \nradar, below the safety net \u0014\n\u0014\nThe South Bronx Health Center sits in the shadow of New York's \nBruckner Expressway. This state-of-the- art facility, built by a \ncharity called The Children's Health Fund, is at the center of \nanother community that doesn't register on most Americans' radar. In \na white lab coat and tie decorated with balloons, Dr. Shawn Bowen, \n38, treats children in one of urban America's most hard-bitten \nneighborhoods. He came here because his student loans would be \nforgiven if he worked in this \"third world\" environment. He stayed \nwhen he learned of the fathomless need and the importance of an \nAfrican-American male role model.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike many of America's emergency medical providers, Dr. Bowen says \nhe's seeing an increase in the number of children suffering from the \nmedical effects of malnutrition, called \"failure to thrive\" (FIT). \nThese children have trouble concentrating, are unusually vulnerable \nto illness and suffer developmentally. One toddler particularly \nworries Dr. Bowen. The last time he saw her, she was drastically \nunderweight. He fears she may suffer permanent neurological damage, \nespecially since her parents failed to show up for their appointment \ntoday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the South Bronx, lots of folks who've lost jobs are sitting in \ntheir apartments malnourished, too depressed to go get food or help \nfor their children,\" says Dr. Bowen. \"In some ways, the families who \nhave been poor for a long time are better off. The newly poor don't \nknow where to go for services. They don't know when to get to \npantries before they run out of food or how to apply for food stamps. \nIn the meantime, their children suffer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                          Washed up \nby the economic tide\u0014\n\u0014\nNationwide, the tides of the unstable economy are washing families up \nin places they never expected to find themselves. In Gallup, N.M., \nthousands of Navajos are renting rooms in the string of cheap motels \nthat line a strip of historic Route 66 and trying to flee the \neconomic chaos on the neighboring reservation, where the average per \ncapita income is $6217.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther than crafting jewelry for the souvenir shops nearby on Route \n66, few opportunities exist in the Navajo Nation, which is larger \nthan West Virginia and home to 200,000 people.\u0014\n\u0014\nSophena Murphy, 29, moved to her family's property near the \nreservation town of Yah-Ta-Hey and brought her three girls to Gallup \nso they'd have a chance, she says. Murphy found the cheapest room in \ntown, at a motel, where she now works as a maid. Between her salary \nand the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families aid she \nreceives, she earns $592 a month. Of that, $460 goes toward the rent \nof Room 18. She dreads the end of the month, when the money is gone. \n\"I have to shop really carefully,\" Murphy explains. \"That means not \ntaking my girls along, because they grab for things I can't afford.\" \nLike what? \"You know; luxuries,\" she says, \"like fruits and \nvegetables.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nFood for Kids\u0014\n\u0014\nSo many of Gallup's schoolchildren are living on the same knife's \nedge of need that school buses now schedule pickups at the motels on \nRoute 66. At Lincoln Elementary, Principal Phyllis Casuse says that \n97% of her students live below the poverty line. Her students are so \npoor, she adds, that many don't receive regular meals on the weekends \nand come to school so hungry that they can't concentrate.\u0014\nThat's why Lincoln was one of 35 schools in New Mexico chosen to \nparticipate in the innovative Food for Kids program, which provides \nbackpacks full of nutritious food for students to take home over the \nweekend. Right now, the program only has enough funding to provide 25 \nbackpacks a week to the school.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We have 300 students who probably need that food,\" says Casuse. \n\"There's no way to choose. So we rotate and hand them out to 25 \ndifferent students each week\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this Friday afternoon, 25 Lincoln students march into the health \noffice to pick up their backpacks. As they unzip the bags and peer at \nthe healthy portions of Cereal, yogurt, canned fruit and precooked \npasta, many are so happy that they skip out toward their school buses \nwith the backpacks cradled in their arms, shouting, \"Thank you!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSophena Murphy's frail-looking daughtersJessica, 6, Ashley, 7, and \nSamantha Yazzie, 9appear to struggle just hauling their backpacks \nand book bags toward their bus. At least for this weekend, there in \nthe motel room they call home, they won't know the terrible gnawmg \nsensation of hunger. If only the same could be said for the other \nstudents at Lincoln and the rest of America's hungry children. ~IIE\u0014",

Nazism came out of Germany, one of the most \nChristian countries in Europe. The worst genocide in Africa took \nplace in Rwanda, the most Christianized country on the continent. Now \nMuslim fanatics are showing once again the true face of religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Muslim leaders complain that the United States and Israel \nare trying to pound Arab countries into submission, just as the \nChristian nations of France, England, and Germany did a century ago. \nIn the so-called clash of civilizations, one big loser is genuine \nfaith: Neither Western military power nor Islamic terrorism offers \nmuch to attract a watching world.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps our day calls for a new kind of ecumenical movement: not of \ndoctrine, nor even of religious unity, but one that builds on what \nJews, Christians, and Muslims hold in common, for the sake of mutual \nsurvival. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel first issued the call in 1966, \nin a speech delivered to a group of Christian and Jewish educators. \nHis words apply presciently to our day as the world divides \nincreasingly along religious lines.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeschel, a Polish rabbi deported by the Nazis, later taught at a \nJewish seminary in the United States. Evangelicals widely admire his \nbook The Prophets. He delivered the speech \"What We Might Do \nTogether\" at the height of the Cold War and in the midst of the '60s \nturmoil. Heschel said:\u0014\n\u0014\n    The striking feature of our age is not the presence of anxiety, \nbut the inadequacy of anxiety, the insufficient awareness of what is \nat stake in the human situation.  The cardinal problem is not the \nsurvival of religion, but the survival of man. What is required is a \ncontinuous effort to overcome hardness of heart, callousness, and \nabove all to inspire the world with the biblical image of man, not to \nforget that man without God is a torso, to prevent the dehumanization \nof man. For the opposite of human is not the animal. The opposite of \nthe human is the demonic.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Heschel pointed out, Jews and Christians (and I would add Muslims) \nshare the belief that this world with its history belongs not to us \nbut to God. We disagree over important doctrines, but are united \"in \nour being accountable to God, our being objects of God's concern, \nprecious in his eyes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Jews, Christians, and Muslims have much in common: They honor \nthe authority of Moses and the Hebrew prophets; they believe in the \nCreator, the God of Abraham; they want to fulfill God's commands of \njustice and mercy; they see life as sacred. All three acknowledge \nthat we must oppose evil with a holiness that begins with a proper \nhumility before a sovereign God.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lieutenant in the French army, Christian de Cherg, assigned to \nAlgeria during a violent uprising in 1959, found he could talk about \nGod more freely among Muslims there than he could back in France, \nwhere such talk made people uncomfortable. As a Muslim policeman \nnamed Mohammed told him, \"We never see French soldiers praying. You \nsay you believe in God. How can you not pray if you believe in God?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as the lieutenant was walking with Mohammed, rebels surrounded \nthem. Mohammed placed himself in front of the rifles aimed at \nChristian's chest, insisting that the soldier was a godly man and a \nfriend of Muslims. The rebels withdrew without harming the Frenchman, \nbut the next day Mohammed was found with his throat slit.\u0014\n\u0014\nLieutenant de Cherg ultimately resigned his commission and joined a \nTrappist community in remote Algeria. The monks ministered to the \nsick, gave refuge to the poor, and spent most of their time in \nprayer, thus creating an oasis of Christian faith in a land mostly \nhostile to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, the terrorists had their way. In 1996, seven monks, \nincluding de Cherg, were taken away, held hostage for two months, \nthen beheaded. This brutal incident, however, became a tipping point \nin the war of Islamic radicals against Algeria's governmenta war \nthat had cost perhaps 100,000 livesby turning the majority of \nAlgerians against the radicals. Mainstream Muslims called for an end \nto the violence. Today the monks are honored as martyrs throughout \nAlgeria.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more recently, we have seen Protestant missionaries martyred in \nplaces like Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, and Yemen. \"There are no final \nproofs for the existence of God,\" Rabbi Heschel said in his 1966 \nspeech. \"There are only witnesses.\" And the most convincing witnesses \nfollow Abraham in looking beyond this violent world to a \"city with \nfoundations, whose architect and builder is God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "HIS EXCELLENCY - GEORGE WASHINGTON",
    "words": "HIS EXCELLENCY\u0014\nby Joseph J. Ellis\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington, writes Joseph J. Ellis, was the most ambitious, \ndetermined, and potent personality of an age not lacking for worthy \nrivals. His legendary list of accomplishmentsfrom his famous \ncrossing of the Delaware, the strenuous winter at Valley Forge, and \nhis defeat of British General Cornwallis at Yorktown, to his \nstewardship of the Constitutional Convention and two pivotal terms as \nthe new republics first chief executivevirtually defines the very \nidea of America. Yet when it comes to Washingtons personal life, to \nsay nothing of his character and personality, we are far less \ninformed. As the writer Richard Brookhiser once aptly put it, George \nWashington is in our wallets but not in our hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe brilliant work of a master historian\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, drawing on his extensive research among Washingtons collected \npapers at the University of Virginia, as well as his stunning \nknowledge of early American politics and culture, Pulitzer \nPrize-winning historian Joseph J. Ellis illuminates Washingtons \nstoried life, from his fabled youth and military career to his \nturbulent years as our founding President, as he struggled to shape \nthe nations growing power while managing the swiftly deepening split \nbetween the factions surrounding Thomas Jefferson and Alexander \nHamilton.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough his deft organization of a series of telling details, key \nevents, and revealing excerpts from formerly overlooked documents, \nEllis reconstructs the Generals public and private lives, shedding \nnew light on his marriage and subsequent elevation into the elite \nranks of plantation society, on his many debts, on his relationship \nwith his reckless stepson, and on his views regarding slavery and \nfreedom. Though famous for his stoic, even cold, demeanor, George \nWashington springs to vivid and gripping life in this revelatory \naccount.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Foundingest Father of them all\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his National Book Award-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson, \nAmerican Sphinx, Ellis explored the complex character and brilliant \nmind of one of Americas most iconic figures. In Founding Brothers, \nhis Pulitzer Prize-winning 2001 bestseller, Ellis studied the dynamic \nintersection of thought and action fueling the remarkable group that \ndrove American independence. Now, Ellis employs his vast knowledge \nand trademark wit to illuminate the most elusive, complex, and iconic \nof any of his storied subjects, the man he half-jokingly calls the \nFoundingest Father of them all.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed, His Excellency is a \ntriumph of the biographers art. Throughout seven boldly imaginative \nand impeccably researched chapters, Joseph J. Ellis has again \nproduced a work of sustained and dazzling intelligence, peeling back \nthe accumulated layers of myth and mystery to restore the real \nWashington to the 18th-century world in which he triumphed. 352 pages \n?6 1/8\" x 9 1/4\"  16 pages of photographs\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Joseph J. Ellis is the author of Founding Brothers, \nwinner of the Pulitzer Prize, and American Sphinx, winner of the \nNational Book Award. He is Professor of History at Mount\u0014",

    "title": "HITLER AND THE VATICAN - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "In the eyes of many secular historians, the Catholic Church has \nplayed a singularly pernicious role in world history. Exhibit A in \ntheir case against the Church has been the Vaticans behavior during \nWorld War II, when Pope Pius XII is widely credited with having \nwinked and nodded while Hitlers war machine slaughtered its way \nacross Europe. One author even went so far as to dub the dour pontiff \nHitlers Pope.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlocking the archives\u0014\n\u0014\nHow credible are these allegations? Thanks in part to the Vaticans \npolicy of official secrecy regarding the records it compiled during \nthe Nazi period, that question seemed destined to remain unanswered. \nThat is, until now. Peter Godman, one of the worlds most respected \nVatican scholars, has taken advantage of a remarkable decision by the \nVatican to unlock the archives dealing with its internal \ndeliberations about and relations with the Third Reich. The result is \nHitler and the Vatican, a major new contribution to the dialogue on \nthe Catholic Churchs Nazi policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book dares to ask the difficult questions. Why did the Church \nnot raise its institutional voice against the evils of Hitlerism? \nDoes Pius XII deserve the condemnation he has received in some \nquarters? Did the Vaticans fixation with Communism cause it to turn \na blind eye to, or even enable, the atrocities of the Third Reich? \nThe answers may end up pleasing neither side in this heated debate, \nbut they bring us closer to the truth than any previous study of the \nsubject.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlamming the false cult of race\u0014\n\u0014\nNew revelations abound. Germanys leading Catholic bishop, Alois \nHudal, was an early and vocal critic of the Nazis. He urged the \nVatican to condemn Hitlers regime before it destroyed his country, \nyet eventually became so disillusioned by Church foot-dragging that \nhe went over to the Nazi sideeven helping to facilitate the escape \nof Nazi leaders to Argentina. One of Godmans most eye-opening \ndiscoveries is a draft document condemning National Socialisms moral \nand doctrinal errors, prepared under the auspices of Pius XIIs \npredecessor, Pius XI. The document, prepared soon after Hitlers rise \nto power, slams the Fuhrers regime for its false cult of race and \nits idolatrous nationalism. Alas, it was quashed by the Pope himself \nbefore it could see the light of day andperhapsslow the expanse of \ntotalitarianism beyond Germany. Godman reproduces the entire \ndocumenta watered-down version of which was issued in 1937allowing \nreaders to judge for themselves what its existence says about Church \nattitudes toward the Nazis.\u0014\n\u0014\nGodmans gripping narrative provides an unprecedented look at the \ninnermost workings of the Vatican during one of the most tumultuous \nperiods in world history. Always measured and even-handed, never \ntendentious, this full and fair examination of the evidence renders \nmany previous volumes on the subject obsolete. 288 PAGES \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: Peter Godman is one of the worlds leading Vatican \nscholars, now at the University of Rome and formerly of the \nUniversity of Tubingen. An atheist, he has nonetheless won admiration \nwithin the Vatican as well as the scholarly world for his monographs.\u0014",

    "title": "HOLOCAUST DENIAL",
    "words": "Holocaust Denial: What It Is and Why Evangelical Scholars Must Reject \nIt\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard V. Pierard\u0014\n09-29-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Holocaust, the effort of the German Nazis to wipe out the entire \nJewish population of Europe, is the greatest tragedy that the Jewish \npeople every faced. It is also a Christian problem because most of \nthe perpetrators of the Holocaust were baptized church members, and \nthe bystanders, those who did nothing to halt it or even to assist \ntheir beleaguered Jewish neighbors, as well were members in good \nstanding of Protestant and Catholic churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, there are people out there who claim the Holocaust \nnever happened. For them to say that the Jews imagined or invented \ntheir tragedy is the most vicious and virulent form of anti-Semitism \nimaginable. It negates the shared experience of the Jewish community \ntoday and lays the groundwork for the possibility of another attempt \nat total destruction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Holocaust deniers constitute a vast, interlocking network. They \nmaintain a strong presence on the Internet and their sites \ncross-reference one other. This is illustrated by the well-known \nstory of the high school teacher who had assigned her students to \nwrite a term paper using the World Wide Web. One young person chose \nthe Holocaust and wrote a horrible paper denying its historical \nvalidity, having drawn on material from the denier Web sites. The \nteacher had failed to explain that not everything on the Internet can \nbe trusted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese people utilize a number of approaches to negate the clear facts \nof this incredible tragedy. One is to explain the deaths of Jews in \nthe camps as the result of wartime exigencies--Allied bombings, \nspread of disease, food shortages, overcrowding and overworked prison \nlabor. As for the gas chambers and crematoria, they were for \ndelousing the clothing of inmates and disposing of those who had died \nnaturally, and the latter were many because of the difficult wartime \nconditions and unanticipated overcrowding of the camps. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother approach is that of moral equivalency. Some deniers maintain \nthat what Nazis did to Jews was no different than what other nations \ndid to their enemies. The United States dropped atomic bombs on two \nJapanese cities and placed Japanese-Americans in concentration camps. \nThe British systematically destroyed German cities through their area \nbombing campaigns. Stalin and the Chinese Communists killed far more \npeople than the Germans did. \u0014\n\u0014\nI would argue that Holocaust revisionism or denial is completely \noff-limits for Christian scholars, and in fact it is quite dangerous \nin even the most general sense.\u0014\n1.) It leads people to be confused as to what had really happened, \nand it spreads doubt in the public mind. A few years ago the American \nJewish Committee commissioned a survey by the Roper Organization. Of \nthose polled 22 percent said it seemed possible to them that the \nNazi extermination of the Jews never happened and 12 percent said \nthey didnt know. \u0014\n\u0014\n2.) Holocaust denial is at the core a threat to all who believe that \nknowledge and memory are keystones of our civilization. The Holocaust \nis not merely a tragedy of the Jews but a tragedy of civilization in \nwhich the victims were Jews. It was carried out by a highly advanced \ntechnological society, by people who were products of one of the best \neducational systems in the world. Thus to deny its reality is not a \nthreat just to Jewish history but a threat to all who believe in the \npower of reason. Holocaust denial repudiates reasoned discussion in \nmuch the same way that the Holocaust itself repudiated civilized \nvalues. It is the ultimate glorification of irrationalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.) Holocaust denial reflects the direction that the intellectual \nclimate in the scholarly world has taken in the last quarter century. \nThe deniers are plying their trade at a time when much of history \nseems to be up for grabs and attacks on the Western rationalist \ntradition have become commonplace. There are no objective truths; \nthere is no one version of the world that is necessarily right while \nanother is wrong. Every conceptual system is as good as another. One \ncannot dismiss out of hand even the most far-fetched notions simply \nbecause they are absurd.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern deconstructionist thought argues that experience is relative \nand nothing is fixed. Thus, this atmosphere of intellectual \npermissiveness makes it difficult for people to assert that anything \nis false or off-limits. How can one say that the Holocaust denial is \na movement with no scholarly, intellectual or rational validity? \nAfter all, no fact, no event, no aspect of history, has any fixed \nmeaning or content. Any truth can be retold. Any fact can be recast. \nThere is no ultimate historical reality. Knowledge dissolves into \nnothingness.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.) Holocaust denial rehabilitates anti-Semitism in the modern world. \nAs Walter Reich, a former director of the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Museum, wrote in the New York Times on July 11,1993, the \ndeniers, by convincing the world that the great crime for which \nanti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened--indeed, that it was \nnothing more than a frame-up invented by Jews, and propagated by them \nthrough their control of the media, make anti-Semitic arguments seem \nonce again respectable in civilized discourse and even acceptable for \ngovernments to pursue anti-Semitic policies. \u0014\n\u0014\nHolocaust denial makes the world safe for anti-Semitism, and in \neffect, as historian Yehuda Bauer has said in my hearing, creates the \npreconditions that would deny the Jewish people the right to live in \nthe post-Holocaust world. \u0014\n\u0014\n5.) Finally, Holocaust denial is a deterrent to exploring the deep \neffects which sin has on human society. Historians, theologians, \nphilosophers, sociologists, and psychologists have sought to explain \nthe Holocaust by asking the most fundamental question of all about \nthe human condition: Why did this happen? As we explore the matter \nourselves, we as Christian scholars are prepared to include human sin \nas a root cause. However, the deniers respond: It didnt happen. \nThus, we dont need to ask this ultimate question about human \nfailure. But as Christian scholars, is this not the very place where \nwe should begin our inquiry?\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Pierard is professor of history emeritus at Indiana State \nUniversity and Stephen Phillips Professor of History at Gordon \nCollege in Wenham, Mass.

    "title": "HUMAN SACRIFICE REDUX",
    "words": "Human Sacrifice Redux\u0014\nHow the church battles deadly prophets in its midst.\u0014\nBy Obed Minchakpu in Jos | posted 11/22/2004\u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to persistent reports of human sacrifice last August, \npolice raided several shrines of African traditional religionists in \nOkija, Anambra state, in largely Christian southern Nigeria. The \nreports had understated the problem. To their horror, authorities \nrecovered more than 80 skulls and 50 fresh corpses. In these shrines, \nthe police recovered three registers. They list 1,258 visitors who \nhad allegedly come to offer human sacrifices in the past five years.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians say the raid was an answer to their prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast Easter, Christians in Okija began praying and fasting for \ndeliverance from the gods of the traditionalists. Ifeanyi Atueyi, a \nChristian pharmacist, said idol worship had desecrated the land. \"We \nbelieve that the problems holding us down are these idols, and so we \ncentered our prayers on these idols. I never knew God can intervene \nso quickly and in this way,\" Atueyi said. \"It is marvelous and very \ndramatic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most adherents of African traditional polytheism practice their \nbeliefs peacefully, a minority engages in ritual killings. Precise \nfigures on the phenomenon are impossible to obtain. However, the bbc \nreports that police in South Africa estimate that hundreds of \nchildren have died so their body parts could be used in potions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002, London police discovered the mutilated torso of a young boy \nfloating in the Thames. The boy was apparently the victim of a West \nAfrican ritual for good luck. European authorities say such \nsacrifices have probably reached double figures across the continent \nin immigrant communities. Police believe the boy may have been \nsacrificed to one of the 400 ancestor gods of the Yoruba, Nigeria's \nsecond-largest people group.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Christians in the Idepe and Ogute villages in southwestern \nNigeria, February and March every year are anxious periods, when \nanimists hold their fetish festivals of sacrifice, which usually last \nfor 21 days. Minority groups of Christians are banned from worshiping \nin their churches. Last February 27, animists burned down two \nchurches in the states of Ondo and Edo that defied their ban on \nchurch activities. Joshua Ogunele, Anglican bishop of the Ikale \ndiocese, told CT that traditionalists also burned down two churches \nin 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnimists say their gods dislike Christian worship during the \nreligious festival. \"This is a taboo,\" the chief priest of the \nreligious group told CT in Ogute village.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians are responding on a number of fronts. Earlier this year, \nthree pastors and twenty-one other Christians from the town of Neke \nin Enugu state in southeastern Nigeria attempted to expose human \nsacrifices and idol worship by a traditionalist religious group that \nhas killed at least thirty-two people. For their efforts, they were \narraigned before the magistrate court in Ikem town, charged with \ndestroying the shrines where animists made their human sacrifices. \nTheir case is pending.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast May, Christians held an evangelistic crusade in Neke. They say \nmany animists in the area turned to Christ. But there is much work \nahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastor Joseph Agbo, a native of Neke, told CT he couldn't even guess \nthe number of people sacrificed in the community.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It will be like asking me to count the grains of sand on the \nseashore.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today.

Her only talent was the ability to \nsing, especially the spirituals which were so much a part of her \nlife. \u0014\n\u0014\n     In 1963, when she was 45, she heard a speech that turned her \nlife around. In the speech, she was told that she was a citizen and \ncould vote. So she tried to register but failed the literacy test \nwhich was then required. She vowed she'd be back the next month to \ntry again -- and again -- and again -- until she passed. The landlord \ncame and told her that if she persisted, she'd lose the little bit of \nfarming equipment she had and the land she and her husband were \nsharecropping. She persisted and was evicted. One of the voter \nregistration groups heard of her courage and asked her to work for \nthem, which she did. In her travels, she was arrested for going into \nthe whites only part of a bus station, hauled off to jail and badly \nbeaten. After some pressure from the U.S. Justice Department, she was \nreleased. Surprisingly, the bitterness that might have been there \nwasn't. As she put it, It wouldn't solve any problem for me to hate \nwhites just because they hate me. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Here was a woman, mostly self-educated, who decided in the \nlatter half of her life to use the God-given power that was hers for \nbringing justice to Ruleville and other parts of the South. \u0014\n\u0014\n     And so a cactus blooms over a grave that friends had to take up \na collection to buy. And the cactus stands as a symbol of a woman who \ncould bloom in the midst of an arid desert of injustice and hatred.\u0014\n\u0014\n     --Henry Sawatzky,\u0014\n     On Not Being Powerless\u0014",

    "words": "Have you ever wondered how we got our Nativity? The Gospels give us \nthe beloved story of Christ's birth, of course. But who started the \ntradition of placing crches on the fireplace mantel or coffee table? \nWhen did churches start dramatizing Mary and Joseph's journey to \nBethlehem, or choirs begin singing the angels' praises in the \n\"shepherds' fields?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor that we have to thank St. Francis, that remarkable 13th-century \nItalian friar best known for his love of animals and commitment to \nsimple living.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story goes that a woodcarver, embittered by his daughter's \nblindness, declared he would have nothing to do with a God \"who \ncondemns innocent children to darkness.\" He stopped going to church, \nand refused to make anything that would bring glory to God. But out \nof love for his girl, he consented to carve a doll for her as a \nChristmas present (even though he no longer had reason to celebrate).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet his wife continued to believe the gospel message, and when St. \nFrancis came to town, she went to go listen to him preach. She \nwondered at the friar's extraordinary peace and gentleness, yet no \namount of pleading could convince her husband to go with her. Until \nChristmas Eve, that is, when she stole her husband's doll and took it \nto Francis, who had set upon the idea of creating a nativity but \nneeded a baby Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe carver discovered the theft, and realizing what his wife had \ndone, headed for the friar's church. But upon finding his wife, he \nstood transfixed, for around his carved doll the friar with animals \ngathered round, singing the ageless story of the birth of our Savior. \nAnd the carver's bitterness melted away. Francis approached him, \ngripping his shoulder. \"You wondered if God could cure blindness? \nWell, we are watching him do it, are we not?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Christmas season, many of us have reason to not celebrateto \ninstead throw our pain in God's face and ask why we should be glad \nhis son came to earth. But Jesus understands our painhe endured the \ngreatest suffering any of us could ever imagine. And on this joyous \nmorning, we invite you to walk into that stable, to hear the music of \ndelighted angels, and join in the chorus, \"Glory to God in the \nhighest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.\"\u0014",

    "title": "HAIL MARY",
    "words": "\"Hail Mary\"\u0014\nHer moment of obedience triggered two millennia of reverence.\u0014\nDavid Lyle Jeffrey\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sixth month of her elderly cousin Elizabeth's pregnancy, a \nyoung, betrothed Jewish girl was astonished by a visit from an angel. \nIt was the angel Gabriel, and he greeted the girl Mary with a \nreverential \"Hail\" and announced that she had \"found favor\" with God \nand was to conceive and bear a child to be called Jesus. Shocking \nenough; but there was more: the conception would occur not by natural \nmeans, but by the agency of the Holy Spirit (1:35-37).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary responded in obedience. She called herself the Lord's \n\"handmaiden\" (Luke 1:38, 48)a humble title that set the tone for the \nrest of the New Testament accounts and became the foundation for \ncenturies of Marian devotion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary recognized that she had become, like Enoch (Gen. 5:22) and Noah \n(who \"found grace in the eyes of the LORD\" [Gen. 6:8]), one \"highly \nfavored\" by God (Luke 1:28, 30). She saw that she would forever after \nbe recognized as one \"blessed  among women\" (28, 42). This blessing \nwas not for her alone, as she sang in her Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), \nbut for all God's children. She was the one woman, out of all women, \nthrough whom God would fulfill his covenant love and promise.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow improbable! This obscure Jewish girl became, through the work of \nthe Holy Spirit and her willing obedience, the instrument of divine \ngrace. Through her, the majesty and unapproachable holiness of God \njoined the frail impermanence of fallen humanity. She was the chosen \nvessel of the Incarnation, at the pivot point of God's saving plan. \nHow could Mary not loom in the imagination of the church?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman and the Word\u0014\nAlthough Mary the mother of Jesus is of almost unrivaled importance \nin historic Christianity, and although her role in salvation history \nis central, she has a comparatively modest role in the Bible itself. \nEven where Mary does appear in the Gospels, she often has only a \ncameo, and in several instances, she does not even get a speaking \npart.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gaps and silences in the biblical texts have invited speculation, \nand writers of a number of apocryphal books (p. 18) purport to reveal \ndetails of her biography not found in the canon, inspiring much art \nand even some doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe central importance of Mary in Christian tradition, however, is \nrooted in the Bible. It is in her role as the \"mother of Jesus\"-or, \nin Elizabeth's words, \"mother of my Lord\" (Luke 1:43)-that we meet \nher in the Gospels' pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke, of course, tells her story most fully (1:26ff; cf. Matthew \n1:18ff). There we find not only Gabriel's Annunciation to Mary, but \nalso her poetic response, the prayer-song known as the Magnificat \n(because it begins \"Magnificat anima mea Dominum\" or \"My soul \nmagnifies the Lord\").\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Magnificat reveals Mary as, like Miriam and Hannah before her, a \ndivinely inspired poet. This trait she also shares with her ancestor \nDavid. Indeed, her spontaneous poem recalls the Psalms (especially \nPss. 111:9; 103:17; 89:10; 107:9; 98:3), just as Elizabeth's words of \ngreeting to her, \"Blessed are you among women,\" echo Psalm 1: \n\"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Magnificat soon entered the liturgy of the church. Among \nAnglicans it continues to be recited daily at evensong, and Catholics \nuse it in worship, where it is often sung rather than spoken, as in \nthe beautiful version of the Franciscan singer and liturgist John \nMichael Talbot. In this context all of the congregation joins Mary in \npraise: \"Holy is his name.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMary's Visitation to Elizabeth, whose fetal child John the Baptist \n\"leaps for joy\" in her womb at Mary's approach (1:39-56), completes \nthe story of the Annunciation. Along with Gabriel's Ave Maria and \nMary's Magnificat, the Visitation confirms that the events Mary is \ncaught up in are indeed God's fulfillment of \"all that the prophets \nhad spoken.\" Not surprisingly, along with the plethora of artworks \ndedicated to the Annunciation, Christian artists have created many \nimages depicting this portentous visit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary the Bible student\u0014\nBecause of the doctrine of the Incarnation, Mary is associated with \nthe fulfillment of the Word of God and thus with Scripture. In many \nRenaissance paintings the Angel Gabriel finds her reading the Bible. \nIt is historically unlikely that Mary would have had access to a \nscroll of Torah. Yet artists seeking to symbolize her faithfulness \npictured her as a careful student of the Word of God. This \nattentiveness to God's written Word was not only a sign of her \nobedience, pious artists thought, but also a preparation for her \ncoming role as the receptacle for his Word made flesh in Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, Mary's supposed study of Scripture would make her a model \nfor all those who would seek to harbor Christ in themselves. So, in \nRoger van der Weyden's (ca. 1400-1464) Annunciation, Mary's bedroom \nis imagined as a church sanctuary, and her hand is shown raised over \nthe Bible. This makes visual her verbal words of faith and obedience: \n\"Be it unto me according to thy Word\" (Luke 1:38). Following this \nline of thought, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), among others, spoke of \nMary as the model and patron saint of all those called to study \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo painting of the Annunciation captures this theme so well, perhaps, \nas that of Robert Campin (1375/80-1444), sometimes called \"The Master \nof Flemaille\" (below). We see Mary seated on the floor rather than on \nthe bench, absorbed in reading Scripture. Another book, perhaps a \ncommentary, lies on the table beside a kind of book bag and some \nnotes. Behind her hangs the talit, or prayer shawl-presumably of her \nfather Joachim. The vase on the table holds a lily; on it are visible \nHebrew letters; the vase symbolizes Mary's virgin womb. The angel \nGabriel has just entered the room; the beating of his wings has \nsnuffed out the candle, and Mary is captured, by the painter's \nbrilliance, just as she is beginning to shift her eyes toward \nGabriel. Intent upon the Law, she is about to be surprised by Grace. \nThe Scripture cradled in her arms has its binding protected by a \ncloth, an allusion to the swaddling cloths in which she will wrap the \nnewborn Jesus: this touch renders powerfully transparent the link \nbetween the Word and the Word-made-flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe who was foretold\u0014\nChristians seeking links between Jesus' birth and Old Testament \nprophecies focused early and often on Mary's unprecedented virgin \nconception (cf. Luke 1:34). In this, they followed the New Testament \nsources. Matthew, in his telling of Jesus' birth (1:22-23), brings \nthe promise in Isaiah to bear on Jesus-\"Behold, a virgin shall \nconceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel\" (7:14). \nThe virginity of Mary became one of the crucial tokens for early \nbelievers that Jesus was \"the Christ\" long expected.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian readers of the 1st century would have expected Mary herself \nto be about 12 years of age-the age ascribed to her by two apocryphal \ngospels and the common age of betrothal. Mary's youthful virginity \nwas nonetheless theologically important, as was her lineage as a \nscion of the root of Jesse, the house of David. These matters, along \nwith the spare canonical narratives, gave rise to apocryphal accounts \nof her childhood and parentage.\u0014\n\u0014\nReferences to Mary are in other respects slight in the first \ncenturies of the Church. From the time of Irenaeus (d. A.D. 200), \nChristian apologists combated gnostic heretics by pointing out Mary's \nsignificant place in salvation history. This allowed them to clarify \nthe biblical case for Christ's human as well as divine nature, over \nagainst the gnostics' spiritualizing of Christ. The formula offered \nby Irenaeus, that Mary is a \"second Eve,\" becomes standard in Marian \nliterary typology.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2nd-century frescoes from Roman catacombs, we see Mary represented \nas the fulfillment of the \"virgin\" in Isaiah 7:14. Such \nrepresentations amount to a statement about the two natures of Christ \nand the purity of his birth-a statement verbalized and made binding \nin the Apostles' Creed, the Chalcedonian Council, the Old Roman \nBaptismal Creed (Hippolytus), and the Niceno-Constantino-politan \nCreed (A.D. 381).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trouble with Mary\u0014\nBy the 4th century, apocryphal Mary narratives had become popular \namong sects such as the Collyridians, whom Epiphanius (310-403) \ndenounced for offering sacrifices of cakes to Mary, saying: \"Let Mary \nbe held in honor. Let the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be adored, but \nlet no one adore Mary.\" Ambrose (ca. 339-397) similarly cautioned \nthat worshippers must not divert to Mary the adoration due only to \nGod: \"Mary was the temple of God, not the God of the temple. And \ntherefore he alone is to be worshipped who is working in his temple.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLater controversy concerning Mary's role led to various attempts by \nthe Fathers to clarify her specific virtues. Virginity was already a \nhigh ascetic ideal for Jerome (340/2-420), Ambrose, and Augustine \n(354-430), each of whom readily celebrated Mary as the premiere \nexample of virginity as a spiritual vocation. Jerome wrote his \ninfluential De perpetua virginitate Beatae Mariae adversus Helvidium \n(A.D. 383) as a reply to Helvidius, who maintained that mention in \nthe Gospels of the \"sisters\" and \"brethren\" of Jesus, as well as the \nstatement that Joseph \"knew her not until she had brought forth her \nfirstborn son\" (Matthew 1:25), suggests that the virginity associated \nwith Jesus' conception and birth had evidently given way subsequently \nto a normal marriage relationship between Mary and Joseph.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcerned that such a view might rank virginity lower than matrimony, \nfor Jerome an impossible reversion to the patriarchal system of the \nancient Hebrews, he uses the Pseudo-Gospel of Mary and the \nProtevangelium of James (ca. 180) to argue three positions that \nsubsequently became central to Marian literature: (1) that Joseph was \nonly apparently, not actually, the husband of Mary-in particular, \nthat he was elderly and remained a virgin (3-8; 21-22); (2) that the \n\"brethren\" of the Lord were actually his cousins, children of another \nMary, the wife of Cleophas (9-17); and (3) that virginity is \nspiritually preferable to wedlock, which entails many hindrances to \nprayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerpetual Bride\u0014\nSince very early in the history of the church, Christians have dwelt \ndevotionally on Mary's virginity-often insisting that that virginity \nwas never violated throughout her life. Like other Marian themes, \nthis one had its heyday in the medieval period. Anthony of Padua \n(1195-1231), who saw Mary as the natural human channel for devotion \nto the Passion of Christ, championed and codified the idea of the \n\"virgin bride\"-a common theme in medieval iconography (see Cologne \naltarpiece, above). Anthony found \"types\" of Mary's perpetual \nvirginity in many places in Scripture: the burning bush of Moses that \nburned without being consumed (Exodus 3:2); the fleece of Gideon \nthat, as a sign of God's election, remained untouched by the \nnight-time dew (Judges 6:37-38); and the \"closed gate\" of Ezekiel \n44:2, which after being entered by \"the LORD God of Israel\" was never \nagain to be used.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnthony also found Mary's virginity prefigured in the mountain from \nwhich, without hands, is hewn the little stone that destroys the \nempires of this world (Daniel 2:34) and the \"rod out of the root of \nJesse\" (Isaiah 11:1) which, like Aaron's, miraculously blooms.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153) had written, in his commentary on \nthe Song of Songs and in a Marian hymn, of the \"rosa sine spina\"-the \nrose without thorns. After Bernard, this became as frequent a symbol \nfor Mary's loveliness as the lily was for her purity (as the medieval \ncarol goes, \"A roose hath borne a lilly white\"). Finally, in one of \nthe most important papal announcements of the Middle Ages, the \"Unam \nsanctam\" of Pope Boniface VIII (1302), Boniface made the bride of \nSong of Songs 6:8 stand officially for Mary as representative of the \nchurch, thus coloring and amplifying much of the other typology.\u0014\n\u0014\nEspecially after the later Middle Ages, Christians saw Mary as a \nrepresentative of the church in heaven-the \"church triumphant\"-to \nwhom prayer might be addressed. Even so strict a biblicist as the \n\"morning star of the Reformation,\" John Wyclif (1324-1384), thought \nit \"impossible that we should obtain the reward of heaven without the \nhelp of Mary. There is no sex or age,\" he wrote, \"no rank or position \nof anyone in the human race which has no need to call upon the help \nof the Holy Virgin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps if England had been more influenced by Wyclif and Luther than \nby Calvin and Cromwell, even Reformation poets might have shied away \nless sharply from Mary as a subject for poetry. Calvin's central \ncontention that Mary's \"virtues and all her excellences are nothing \nother than the generosity of God\" (New Testament Commentaries 1.22) \nleads him to say that \"to this day we cannot enjoy the blessing \nbrought to us in Christ without thinking at the same time of that \nwhich God gave as adornment and honor to Mary, in willing her to be \nthe mother of his only-begotten Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Lyle Jeffrey is Distinguished Professor of Literature and the \nHumanities and Provost of Baylor University.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

    "title": "HE SAVED TWO",
    "words": "There is a man in Poland named Miecyslaw Kasprzyk.  He lives in a \nshack on top of a hill outside a little town near Krakow.  He is 79, \nhas a bad leg but he stands ramrod straight.  Mostly these days he \ntakes care of his chickens and drinks a little vodka and squints \nthrough thick glasses.  But he sees clearly enough.  He always has.  \u0014\n\u0014\nHe saved the life of a little girl during the war by hiding her from \nthe Nazis. She was 11, Amalia, adrift and lost in Nazi terrorized \nEurope when Mr. Kasprzyk, risking his life, hid her and her brother \nin his family's farmhouse, in the attic. How can you not help, if a \nchild asks? Mr. Kasprzyk said.  \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, many did not.  They stayed silent in countries the Nazis \noverran, though they must have known that what they were doing or \nallowing to be done was vile and evil.  But many, many knew and \nnodded, or knew and looked away, or told themselves they really did \nnot know.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot Mr. Kasprzyk.  Soon after the German invasion of Poland in 1939, \nhe understood.  Polish police officers ordered him to take a small \ngroup of Jews to a local Jewish cemetery in his horse cart.  The Jews \nwere stripped and shot and their jewelry distributed to local \nofficials.  He was 14.  The episode stuck in his throat.  Someone \nwho does not know the difference between good and evil is worth \nnothing, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the attic hiding place seemed too vulnerable Mr. Kasprzyk moved \nAmalia and her brother to a friend's farm where they had new names, \nwent to church every Sunday, peeled potatoes, slept on the kitchen \nfloor and told anyone who asked that they were Catholic and orphans.  \nThe farmers they lived with never knew their true identity.  In 1945, \nwhen Poland was liberated, Amalia and her brother went to a Jewish \norphanage in Krakow.  \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Kasprzyk, a righteous Pole, did not do well after the war.  The \nsame nonconformism that led him to defy the Nazis with decency also \nled him to defy Communist authority.  He is a poor man.  But as Fritz \nStern, the great historian of Germany, said recently, Even in the \ndarkest period, there were individuals who showed active decency, \nwho, defying intimidation and repression, opposed evil and tried to \nease suffering.  I wish these people would be given a proper European \nmemorial not to appease our conscience, but to summon the courage of \nfuture generations.  \u0014\n\u0014\nAmalia grew up and married and became the mother of the wife of Roger \nCohen, who wrote this story in the New York Times (January 30, \n2005).  This year, almost 60 years after he saved her life, he limped \ntoward her and embraced her with tender words\u0014",

    "words": "'Hymn for Easter Day'\u0014\nCharles Wesley's 'Christ the Lord Is Risen Today' brings alleluia's \nhistorical significance to modern audiences.\u0014\nby Collin Hansen | posted 03/24/2005 10:45 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong before I ever understood Christ's atoning sacrifice or \nappreciated his glorious resurrection, I formed strong associations \nwith Easter. Sure, the candy and family gatherings created fond, \njoyous memories. But it was the musicthe same songs every year in my \nMethodist churchthat blossomed with new meaning after my teenage \nconversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nChief among these tunes is one most will surely recognize\"Hymn for \nEaster Day,\" written in 1739 for the inaugural service at the Foundry \nMeeting House, London's first Wesleyan chapel. You know the hymn as \n\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today,\" composed by the most famous hymn \nwriter of all, Charles Wesley, one year after his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs with many of the most popular hymns, \"Christ the Lord Is Risen \nToday\" has survived the centuries thanks to a successful marriage of \nlyrics and music. Its tune first circulated in 1708 with the Lyra \nDavidica hymnal, but no composer has ever been acknowledged. However, \nif you examine Hymn 716 from A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the \nPeople Called Methodists, John Wesley's hymnbook first published in \n1780, you may notice a conspicuous absence. Charles Wesley's original \ntext does not include the song's most distinctive characteristicthe \n\"Alleluia!\" that ends each line. It seems the lyrics didn't quite fit \nthe tune, so an unknown editor added the famous alleluias later.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the special Easter significance of alleluia, it's a match made \nin heaven. Alleluia, meaning \"Praise the Lord,\" prominently leads off \nPsalms 106, 111, 112, 113, 117, and 135 in the Hebrew hymnal. In the \nyears immediately following Christ's resurrection, alleluia \nparticularly connoted praise for Jesus' victory over death. Early \nChristians began greeting each other on Easter with the now-familiar \ncall and response: \"Alleluia! He is risen!\" \"Alleluia! He is risen \nindeed!\" Alleluia is meant to convey emphatic joy, thanksgiving, and \ntriumph.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn captures the triumph in Revelation 19 with his vision of the \ngreat multitude in heaven roaring, \"Alleluia!\" Jerome, translator of \nthe Latin Vulgate, conveyed the joy when he wrote that Christian \nhouses of worship in the fourth and fifth centuries shook from the \nintense alleluias shouted by believers. Still today, Roman Catholics \nand Anglicans refrain from speaking or singing alleluia during Lent, \nbut they reintroduce the word into their liturgies to express their \nthanksgiving on Easter morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven in nonliturgical churches, alleluia retains a kind of liturgical \nsignificance. Bernard Lord Manning, a hymnologist, historian, and \nobserver of Methodism during the early 20th century, explained how \nhymns like \"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\" functioned as a liturgy \nfor John and Charles Wesley's spiritual descendants.\u0014\n\u0014\n    But in the evening at the chapel [the Dissenting church], though \nI was uncertain about the prayers, there was no gamble about the \nhymns. I knew we should have Charles Wesley's Easter hymn, \"Christ \nthe Lord Is Risen Today,\" with its 24 \"Alleluias\": and we did have \nit. Among any Dissenters worth the name that hymn is as certain to \ncome on Easter Day as the Easter Collect in the Established Church. \nAnd mark this furtherthose 24 \"Alleluias\" are not there for nothing: \nthe special use of \"Alleluia\" at Easter comes down to us from the \nmost venerable liturgies. Our hymns are our liturgy, an excellent \nliturgy. Let us study it, respect it, use it, develop it, and boast \nof it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout my youth, while my theological awareness remained \nprimitive, this melodic liturgy conveyed to me the triumphant joy \nthat is ours on Easter morning. Alleluia! Christ is risen!\u0014\n\u0014\nCollin Hansen is assistant editor for Christianity Today.\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today. Click for reprint information.\u0014",

Indian \nfood prepared by an estimated 2,000 area families will be available. \nDeities will be bathed, dressed in flowers and worshiped.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe center at 6051 Springfield Road in Glen Allen will celebrate the \n16th anniversary of the sanctification of the deities. The \ncelebration will be held Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The \ncenter also will observe the 25th anniversary of its inception.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the celebration, Hindus will seek forgiveness for past \noffenses and ask for blessings in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It will be a very colorful event and is open to the public,\" said \nAdish Jain, vice president of the center.\u0014\n\u0014\nInside the center this week, children practiced dances for the \ncelebration. Outside, Ram Gupta, the center's president, and Jain \ntalked about the coming festivities. Nearby, workers added finishing \ntouches to the center's latest project, a paved parking lot.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hindus believe in one God,\" Gupta said. \"But there are many \nmanifestations of the same God. Each and every form represents one of \nthe attributes of the one God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe altar in the Hindu Center's temple has eight deities. When the \ndeities were installed in 1988, they were sanctified. During next \nweek's celebration, the deities will be resanctified through \nreligious activities such as Homams, a service performed by lighting \na fire. A priest sits by the fire and chants. The deities are then \nsuitable for worshiping, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere also will be a bathing of the gods.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"India is the land of rivers,\" Gupta said. \"We believe water gives us \nlife.\" A total of 216 cone-shaped containers from India will be \nfilled with water and santified. The bathing is performed using a \nsahastradhara, a metal plate with thousands of tiny holes that water \nflows through. Phulangi serva, a special ritual of decorating the \nLord with flowers takes place. After the rituals, the gods \"will be \nas powerful and pure as they were 16 years ago when installed,\" he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We will worship each deity and ask for special blessings,\" Jain \nsaid. \"We will circle the gods, trying to worship him from each and \nevery point.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to the center's priest, priests from Georgia, Florida, \nWashington, D.C., and Maryland will participate in the celebration. \nHindus come from many areas because the Glen Allen temple is the only \none between Washington and North Carolina, Jain said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the center was built, Hindus worshiped in their homes, Gupta \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the idea for the center was born 25 years ago, there were only \nabout 60 families involved, Jain recalled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"All Hindus are believers and want to visit a temple.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Alberta Lindsey at (804) 649-6754 or \nalindsey@timesdispatch.com\u0014",

Jobless for nearly three \nyears and now a resident of the city's Skid Row, the former \nconstruction worker was just passing time. As he walked, he saw a \nwallet on a nearby park bench.\u0014\n\u0014\nInside was $50 in cash -- money that could come in handy for Corbert. \nThen he noticed a man's ID card and pictures of a smiling mother and \nthree young children. This guy's got a family and probably needs \nevery cent, he thought. An hour later he called to return the wallet.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a mini-mall within the upscale Douglasdale Estates in suburban \nCalgary, a fit, black-haired man in his 40s jumped out of a 1996 \nToyota four-wheel-drive vehicle. Spotting a wallet on the sidewalk, \nhe scooped it up and slipped it into his pocket. After visiting a \nvideo rental shop, he drove off -- $50 richer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wallets these people found were among those Reader's Digest \nstaffers \"lost\" all over Canada. In each we put a name, local address \nand phone number, family pictures, receipts -- and $50 in cash.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dropped 120 wallets -- 10 each in three large cities, three major \nsuburban areas, three medium cities and three small towns. We left \nthem in parking lots, malls, bus stops and on sidewalks. Then we \nwaited to see what would happen. To each person who returned the \nwallet, we offered the $50 as a reward.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was no rigorous scientific study but rather a real-life test of \nintegrity. Would people in small towns return the wallets more often \nthan those in big cities? Old folks more than young? Women more than \nmen?\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery wallet told a story like the ones above -- whether of outright \ntheft, a struggle with temptation or a refreshing affirmation of \nhonesty... .\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of 120 wallets dropped in Canada, 77 were returned intact -- 64 \npercent. In a similar Digest survey of 12 U.S. towns and cities, the \nfigure was 67 percent. In Europe it was 58 percent; in Asia, 57 \npercent.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Robert Kiener, \"What do you think?\u0014\nHow honest are we?\" Reader's Digest Canada, March 1997.\u0014",

They \ncommissioned a sculptor to carve a giant statue to stand in front of \ncity hall. Someone suggested a biblical character wrought in the \nneoclassical style, an expression of beauty and strength.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey approached Agostino di Duccio, who agreed to their terms. Duccio \nwent to the quarry near Carrara and marked off a 19-foot slab to be \ncut from the white marble. However, he had the slab cut too thin. \nWhen the block was removed, it fell, leaving a deep fracture down one \nside. The sculptor declared the stone useless and demanded another, \nbut the city council refused. Consequently, the gleaming block of \nmarble lay on its side for the next 38 years, a source of \nembarrassment for all concerned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in 1501, the council approached another citizen, the son of a \nlocal official, asking him if he would complete the ambitious \nproject, using the broken slab. Fortunately for them, the young man \nwas Michelangelo Buonarroti. He was 26 years old, filled with energy, \nskill, and imagination. Michelangelo locked himself inside the \nworkshop behind the cathedral to chisel and polish away on the stone \nfor three years. When the work was finished, it took 49 men five days \nto bring it to rest before the city hall. Archways were torn down. \nNarrow streets were widened. The people from across Europe came to \nsee the 14-foot statue of David relaxing after defeating Goliath. It \nwas even more than the city fathers had envisioned.

    "words": "Editorial By Mortimer B. Zucker, US News and World Report\u0014\n     February 13, 2006\u0014\n         \u0014\n                 AT ONE TIME, MARIAM FARAHAT WAS A\u0014\n         mother of six, but, with her encouragement,\u0014\n         three of her sons blew themselves up on sui-\u0014\n         cide missions to murder innocent Israeli citi-\u0014\n         zens, so now shes a mother of only three. Fara-\u0014\n         hat is famous in Gaza for a recruitment video in which\u0014\n         she shows her 17-year-old son how to kill Israelis in a\u0014\n         suicide attack and then tells him not to come back. For\u0014\n         her willingness to sacrifice her children in a spiraling\u0014\n         culture of death, Farahat became famous as Urn Nidal\u0014\n         Mother of the Struggle. Along with several dozen other\u0014\n         Hamas terrorists, Farahat was just elected to the new\u0014\n         Palestinian Legislative Council.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         What better metaphor could there possibly be\u0014\n         for the cancer now afflicting the Palestinian body poli-\u0014\n         tic than the election of a terrorist group to a majori-\u0014\n         ty in the parliament? As one commentator put it,\u0014\n         The Palestinians are the first terrorist people.\u0014\n          This is a stunning setback\u0014\n         for Washington-and it bears No matter wh\u0014\n         some of the responsibility. The\u0014\n        birth of a Hamas terrorist leaders may Utt(\u0014\n          statelet in the West Bank is ~ basis for d\u0014\n         not just one disaster but many.\u0014\n          It will destroy the Israeli- Hamas, which\u0014\n         Palestinian peace process, it elimination of th\u0014\n         will threaten Americas re-\u0014\n         gional friends, such as Jordan\u0014\n         and Egypt, and it will embolden all of Americas enemies\u0014\n         in the regionSyria, Iran, the Islamic insurgents in Iraq,\u0014\n         al Qaeda, and Hezbollah. Hamastan, as they call it, will\u0014\n         become a training ground for terrorisma sort of\u0014\n         Afghanistan lite, if you will.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n          This is no triumph for democracy. Yes, some of the ma-\u0014\n          jority vote for Hamas was a legitimate repudiation of the\u0014\n          grotesque incompetence and corruption of Yasser Arafats\u0014\n         Fatah Party, but its genes of hate and violence guaran-\u0014\n         tee that a Hamas democracy will mutate into something\u0014\n         very different from what we understand a democracy to\u0014\n         offer: freedom of religion and assembly, freedom of\u0014\n         speech, respect for minorities, equality before the law, and\u0014\n         a commitment to the nonviolent resolution of disputes.\u0014\n     \u0014\n        These characteristics of democracy have no place in\u0014\n         the Hamas polity. What we have instead is an exploita-\u0014\n         tion of the shell of democracy and an explicit commit-\u0014\n         ment to violence and bigotry. As Hamas leader Mah-\u0014\n         moud Zahar put it, We will join the Legislative Council\u0014\n         with our weapons in our hands. These killers will now\u0014\n          be wearing official police and military uniforms. Who\u0014\n          in Palestine will dare argue for a peaceful negotiation\u0014\n         with Israel? Hamas, which claims the blood of almost\u0014\n          600 innocent Israelis on its hands, could not have been\u0014\n         more explicit than it was in a TV advertisement that aired\u0014\n         January 17: We do not recognize the Israeli enemy, nor\u0014\n         his right to be our neighbor, nor to stay [on the land],\u0014\n         nor his ownership of any inch of land.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Most of the civilized world immediately recoiled from\u0014\n         the implications of the Hamas success in the recent bal-\u0014\n         loting, but the evil is so hard to contemplate that there is\u0014\n         aso a good deal of wishful thinking about how Hamas will\u0014\n         mature with responsibility. How can it? Hamas doesnt\u0014\n         even pretend to want peace with Israel. Its goals are, quite\u0014\n         simply, the annihilation of the Jewish state in favor of an\u0014\n         Islamic state throughout the Holy Landan Islamic\u0014\n         regime whose source of authority and laws is Islamic law\u0014\n         as codified in the sharia. As Zahar put it, In the Islamist\u0014\n         Palestinian State, every citizen will be required to act in \nac-\u0014\n         cordance with the codes of Islamic religious law.\u0014\n          \u0014\n        To secular western ears, some of this may seem corn-\u0014\n         pletely bizarre, but Hamas adherents take the words in its\u0014\n         covenant totally seriously. Heres one example: The time\u0014\n         [of Muslim unity will not come until Muslims will fight\u0014\n         the Jews and kill them; until the Jews hide behind rocks\u0014\n         and trees, which will cry, 0, Muslims, there is a Jew behind\u0014\n         me, come on and kill him. In Article 6, the covenant states\u0014\n         Hamass objective clearly: To raise the banner of Allah\u0014\n         over every inch of Palestine. . . Israel will just continue \nuntil\u0014\n         Islam will eliminate it. The conflict is defined in \nreligious\u0014\n         terms: The Land of Palestine from the river to the sea is\u0014\n         considered an Islamic waaf [endowment], and no Mus-\u0014\n         .im has the right to cede any part of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n          A two-state solution? Never! How will Hamas accom-\u0014\n         plish the obliteration of Israel? Article 13 states: There\u0014\n         is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by jihad;\u0014\n         initiatives, proposals, and international conferences are\u0014\n         but a waste of time. A former Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz\u0014\n         Rantisi, spelled it out: We will not leave one Jew in\u0014\n         Palestine. The current Hamas leader, Khaled Mashaal,\u0014\n         reiterated the threat at a post-election press conference\u0014\n         in Damascus. Hamas will not disarm; it will not even\u0014\n         recognize Israels 1967 bordersnever mind the secure\u0014\n         and recognized boundaries for Israel called for by U.N.\u0014\n         resolutions. A two-state solution? Never! vowed Zahar,\u0014\n         when asked if Hamas would recognize Israel.\u0014\n          Hamas is not just a mortal threat to Israel and all who\u0014\n         live in the state. It inhabits an irrational world of para-\u0014\n         noid fantasy.  .....\u0014",

After 13 years he escapes, discovers buried treasure, and \nthen seeks revenge on those who ruined his life. Throughout the movie \nDantes struggles deeply with his belief in God, moving from a simple \nfaith to a loss of faith, and finally to a mature faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of his obsession with revenge and the rage in his life, \nDantes has been unwilling to talk with Mercedes, the woman to whom he \nwas engaged before he went to prison. Thinking that she betrayed him, \nhe does not realize that she never stopped loving him over the years. \nAt the end of the movie, Mercedes finds him and seeks to reconcile \nwith him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Where have you been?\" she asks Dantes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Thirteen years on the Chateau D'Ife, and anywhere else you can \nimagine,\" he replies.\u0014\n\u0014\nMercedes is shocked. \"The Chateau D'Ife for 13 years? Did you suffer?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Look, are you finished now? I have a good deal on my mind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What happened afterward?

    "words": "Few people have had as many natural endowments or achievements to \nfeel proud of as Edwin Hubble, the astronomer for whom the Hubble \nSpace Telescope was named.\u0014\n\u0014\nHubble was a gifted athlete. As writer Bill Bryson recounts, \"At a \nsingle high school track meet in 1906, he won the pole vault, shot \nput, discus, hammer throw, standing high jump, and running high jump, \nand was on the winning mile-relay team. That is seven first places in \none meet. And he came in third in the broad jump. In the same year, \nhe set a state record for the high jump in Illinois.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn top of his athletic gifts, Hubble was extremely good-looking. One \nperson described him as \"handsome almost to a fault.\" Another called \nhim an \"Adonis.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf that weren't enough, Hubble was intellectually gifted. He studied \nphysics and astronomy at the elite University of Chicago, and he was \nselected to be one of the first Rhodes scholars at Oxford.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Hubble began his career as an astronomer at Mount Wilson \nObservatory in California, in 1919, only one galaxy was known: the \nMilky Way. But Hubble showed in a landmark paper in 1924 that the \nuniverse contained many galaxies. Then Hubble proved that the \nuniverse was expanding, an idea no physicist or astronomer had \nconceived of before. Either one of these achievements would have \nguaranteed Hubble a place in history. Yet for Hubble all of this was \nnot enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nHubble claimed he spent most of his late 20's and early 30's as a \nprestigious lawyer in Kentucky. Actually, he spent those years as a \nhigh school teacher in Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nHubble boasted that in World War I he had bravely led \"frightened men \nto safety across the battlefields of France.\" The truth was, he \narrived in France only one month before the Armistice and probably \nnever heard one shot fired.\u0014\n\u0014\nHubble told people how he had daringly rescued drowning swimmers. But \nthat story never happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nHubble bragged about how he had taken on an exhibition bout with a \nworld-class boxer and surprised the champion with an amazing \nknockdown punch. That, also, was too good to be true.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it in human nature that makes us willing to lie to enhance \nour image?\u0014",

    "title": "HIS MOTHER",
    "words": "His Mother\u0014\nLearning from Mary, the maternal model.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Elva McAllaster \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians observe Mother's Day, their thoughts appropriately turn \nto an archetypal mother: to the mother within whose flesh Divinity \nbecame flesh. Ever since the Reformation, Protestants have tended, in \ntheir scorn for Madonna-worship, to ignore what all Christians can \nlearn from her. Mary's experiences were unparalleled in human \nhistory; yet at significant points they can provide a pattern for all \nChristians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, we note the total submission to God's will for her personal \nlife expressed in Luke 1:38: \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it \nunto me according to thy word.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOur attention tends to glide too smoothly over the surface of those \nfamiliar words. What must have whirled within her consciousness on \nthat annunciation day and in succeeding days? Surely there was \nuncertainty, fear of misunderstanding, fear of opprobrium, fear of \nunknown unknowns. Which of us, facing a decision to accept Christ \ninitially or to accept any new yielding to him, has not experienced \nsimilar emotions? But how often is our response so wholly \naffirmative, so accepting?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the instant of the angelic greeting, did Mary have any prophetic \nawareness that her acceptance and submission would mean an arduous \ntrip over interminable hills during the final stages of pregnancy? \n(To see Mary more intelligently and more humanly, one who has never \nbeen pregnant might ask any pregnant woman, any mother, what it would \nhave been like to walk or ride a donkey across all those hills \nbetween Nazareth and Bethlehem.) Did Mary have any inkling that \"be \nit unto me\" would mean an exile in Egypt, and the sword-piercings \nthat would come to her own heart when His was pierced by a Roman \nblade?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps she did. One would think, however, that she did not yet know \nwhat she gave assent to; that like any of us she agreed sight unseen; \nthat her acceptance of God's will was just that, acceptance of God's \nwill. Acceptance of the unknown, the never before experienced, the \npotentially ominous; acceptance of that which may carry a bitter \nprice to the ego of the one who says \"be it unto me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMary accepted, and saw herself as \"the handmaid of the Lord.\" In her \nsubmission she was an exemplar for any Christian of any era, for any \nChristian at any level of spiritual maturity, for any stumbling \nseeker after an encounter with the Holy. \"Be it unto me according to \nthy word\" is an appropriate responsethe only totally appropriate \nresponsein any of the circumstances of life. In practical decisions \nof mundane affairs, in one's efforts toward specific Christian \nservice, in the prunings of the believer's soul that the Holy Spirit \nwould carry out day by day: \"Be it unto me according to thy word.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSecondly, Luke 2:51 suggests that Mary found and understood the roles \nof authority and responsibility within God's plan: \"He went down with \nthem, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.  \" Her son \nwas divine, and she knew that fact from the Annunciation moment, from \nthe first moments when he began to become flesh within her flesh. Yet \nDivinity as a human teenager \"was subject unto\" human parenthood. In \naccepting the authority of God over her life (\"be it unto me\"), Mary \naccepted also the role of a disciplining mother. Imagination supplies \nconjectures as to what being \"subject\" meant, day by day. When to get \nup. When to go to bed. When to bring water from the village well. \nWhen to carry lumber into the carpenter shop. When to give fraternal \ncare to the other children. When to help with the grubbiest chores in \na peasant household. Whatever the details, he was \"subject unto\" his \nparents.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne wonders if Mary sometimes squirmed against and questioned the \ntask of instructing and disciplining Deity. However difficult she may \nhave found it to do, she carried her responsibility: her Son was \nsubject unto her and her husband. The implications seem inescapable \nfor any family, or larger group, that thinks carefully about \nChristian lifestyles. Even in (or especially in) an era that tends to \nsee adults as being subject unto their teenagers rather than vice \nversa, the implications are inescapable.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext, she was a meditating mother. The record continues in Luke 2:51: \n\"His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.\" And the Christmas \nstory reported (Luke 2:19) that Mary \"kept all these things, and \npondered them in her heart.\" Again, her experiences were unique among \nthose of all human beings, and yet she was an archetype, a pattern \nfor all mortals. She is especially a pattern for hurried, flurried, \nmaterialistic Americans who do not know how to ponder on anything, \nwho do not know even faintly how to ponder upon God's actions in \ntheir own lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow often do we even linger through an organ postlude after a \nSunday-morning service to \"ponder\" on God's word that has just been \npreached to us? How often do we watch a sunset through, and ponder? \nHow often do we ponder His doings while we commute, or shop, or clean \nfloors, or pull weeds in a garden? How often do we \"ponder\" together, \nin conversation with other Christians, His ways with us?\u0014\n\u0014\nMary was, furthermore, one who gave leadership to the Christian \ncommunity in its communal prayer. Among the scriptural allusions to \nher, one of the strangely neglected ones is Acts 1: 14; in their \npreparation for Pentecost, the disciples in the upper room \"continued \nwith one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary \nthe mother of Jesus.\" Obviously they were not praying to His Father \nthrough her; she was a supplicator with them, a part of the \"one \naccord.\" But one would assume that her presence, named by name, \ncontributed strength and energy, faith and fervor, to the apostolic \nprayers, and that she was a resource in \"supplication\" on many other \nunnamed occasions. Without undue extrapolation from Acts 1:14, one \nwould assume that she knew, as intensely as did any of the others in \nthat prayer fellowship, the yearnings that preceded Pentecost and the \nvitality that succeeded it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery Christian community (tiny local church, mission, denomination, \nfellowship, or organization) needs those who are ready to join \"with \none accord,\" on all sorts of occasions, \"in prayer and supplication.\" \nWithin the community, every day brings its opportunities, its \npressures, its sorrows, its yearnings; every community needs a \nMarymany a Maryto carry the weight of supplication within, and for, \nand beyond the community.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her prayer, and in the other ways we have noted, Mary is an \ninspiration and pattern for us all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article originally appeared in the May 12, 1972 issue of \nChristianity Today.

In \nterms of winners and losers, it's quite clear who won and who lost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Moussaoui shot back, \"That was my choice.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was hardly your choice,\" Judge Brinkema retorted.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Brinkema, who had been scrupulous about maintaining a neutral \nstance during the trial, concluded by saying, \"As for you, Mr. \nMoussaoui, you came here to be a martyr and to die in a great big \nbang of glory, but to paraphrase the poet T. S. Eliot, instead you \nwill die with a whimper.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Moussaoui tried to interject again, and Judge Brinkema spoke over \nhim, saying, \"You will never again get a chance to speak, and that is \nan appropriate and fair ending.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Judge Brinkema was required to sentence Mr. Moussaoui to life \nin prison after the jury's decision on Wednesday, there was little \nsuspense, but an abundance of drama. It began when Judge Brinkema \nasked whether there were any family members of victims of the Sept. \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the audience who wanted to be heard. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one responded initially. As the judge prepared to move on, \nRosemary Dillard, whose husband died on American Airlines Flight 77 \nwhen it crashed into the Pentagon, rose from the audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalking to a lectern a few feet from Mr. Moussaoui, Mrs. Dillard \nlooked at him and said: \"I want you, Mr. Moussaoui, to know how you \nwrecked my life. You wrecked my career. You took the most important \nperson in my life from me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mr. Moussaoui stared back impassively, she continued, \"I hope that \nyou sit in that jail without seeing the sky, without seeing the sun, \nwithout any contact with the world and that your name never comes up \nin any newspaper again during the rest of my life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe then thanked the judge for \"what you did,\" thanked the \nprosecutors \"for what you tried to do,\" and the court-appointed \ndefense lawyers for \"what you had to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was followed to the lectern by Abraham Scott, who lost his wife \nat the Pentagon on Sept. 11. Mr. Scott told Mr. Moussaoui that \"you \nand all the rest of your colleagues will not deter this country from \ncontinuing to enjoy the freedom that it has for the past 200 years.\" \nHe added that he was confident Mr. bin Laden would eventually be \ncaptured and face justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Lisa Dolan told the court that her husband, a naval officer \nwho died at the Pentagon, had served his country to ensure that it \nmaintained the freedom to conduct fair and open trials like the one \njust concluded. \"There is still one final judgment day,\" Ms. Dolan \nconcluded, staring at Mr. Moussaoui.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Moussaoui then took the witness stand after Judge Brinkema \ninvited him to speak before he was sentenced. He said he wanted to \nrespond to the family members who had just spoken.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The first one say that I destroy her life and she lost her husband,\" \nsaid Mr. Moussaoui, whose native language is French. \"Maybe one day \nshe can think how many people the C.I.A. have destroyed their life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said Americans had \"an amount of hypocrisy which is beyond any \nbelief,\" adding, \"Your humanity is a very selected humanity  only \nyou suffer, only you feel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Robert A. Spencer, the chief prosecutor, objected that it was \ninappropriate for Mr. Moussaoui to make a political speech, Judge \nBrinkema agreed.\u0014\nMr. Moussaoui continued, nonetheless, saying, \"You have branded me a \nterrorist or criminal.\" In fact, he said, he was a soldier in the \nIslamic cause, and \"I fight for my belief.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said Americans had forfeited an opportunity to use the trial to \ndiscover why people like himself and Mohamed Atta, the pilot of one \nof the hijacked planes of Sept. 11, \"have so much hatred for you.\" \nMr. Moussaoui, who was arrested on immigration charges three weeks \nbefore Sept. 11, pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy in the \nattacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he left the courtroom, Mr. Moussaoui repeated his earlier claim \nthat he would be released by President Bush before he left the White \nHouse. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In your dreams!\" Lisa Beilke shouted from the spectator section. \nMrs. Beilke's husband died in the Pentagon.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials said Mr. Moussaoui would soon be transferred.\u0014\n\u0014\n to the federal prison in Florence, Colo., used to house the inmates \nrequiring the greatest security. A prison expert testifying for the \ndefense during the trial said that at the prison Mr. Moussaoui would \nhave no contact with others and would be spoken to only sporadically \nby guards, probably causing him to deteriorate quickly.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW TO CREATE CYNICS",
    "words": "How to Create Cynics\u0014\nEverybody knows when we're covering up our confusion with God-talk.\u0014\n\u0014\nby David P. Gushee  09/05/2006 \u0014\n\u0014\nAre christians also human beings? Are we permitted to talk about our \nlives the way other humans do? Can we admit mistakes, confess \nuncertainty, and be honest about conflicts? Is it okay not to have an \nairtight spiritual explanation for everything that happens?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the greatest causes of cynicism among Christians is the way we \nlather God-talk over our lives in order to obscure realities we \nconsider too painful to discuss directly.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider this example from church life (though such situations are \nnot confined to local churches). A minister is not happy in his place \nof service. He wonders whether he was right in accepting this call in \nthe first place. He has dealt with painful personality conflicts, \nconstant power struggles, and criticism. Now he is leaving. He is \nleaving because he can't take it anymore. His future is most \nuncertain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he believes that he can't say any of these things. There is an \nunwritten Code in the church (and not just this church) that dictates \nhow a minister says goodbye. So he says, \"God spoke to me and is \nleading me to a different place of service at this time. I appreciate \nthe opportunity to be your pastor. I now must move on to wherever God \nleads me next.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody on the inside of the situation knows what these words \nreally mean: \"I am miserable here. I can't take it any more. At this \npoint, I would rather be unemployed than continue to serve here. I'm \nnot sure exactly where God is in all of this, but in any case, I know \nthat I must move on. I sure wish you would deal with the issues that \nhave led me to this point, but I won't tell you what those are, so I \ndoubt that you will actually deal with them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA departing pastor does a church no favor by not discussing its \ndysfunctions. How much better to be candid with the leadership \ngroupperhaps bringing in a third-party consultantin order to equip \nthem to deal in a more health-giving way with their next pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeduced by Certainty\u0014\nThere are several reasons most of us don't feel comfortable speaking \ndirectly about our confusion. One is that we want greater certainty \nabout life and our decisions than we often feel. We want to be able \nto say that we are certain God has led us in such and such a \ndirection and now is leading us in another direction. To articulate \nuncertainty seems to communicate lack of confidence in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might help us to remember that human beings (even Christian ones) \nare fallible and \"see through a glass darkly.\" Surely there is plenty \nof biblical evidence of faithful people who misunderstood God's will \nor did not receive clear direction about every decision. Is it really \nimpossible for us to say, \"I think I misunderstood what God was \nleading me to do\"? Or even, \"I made a mistake in coming here\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerturbed by Conflict\u0014\nA second reason for the Code is that Christians also dislike telling \nthe truth about conflict. The divisions that open up in our \nrelationships and in our churches embarrass us. We think they should \nnot occur. Perhaps we don't want to shake the faith of younger \nChristians by admitting that we just could not work out our \ndifferences. And so we paper over such conflicts with Code-talk about \nGod leading us somewhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Paul highlighted his differences with Peter about table \nfellowship with Gentiles (Gal. 2), and Acts frankly describes the \nconflict between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark (Acts 15), a \nconflict that caused them to go their separate ways. Why can't we \nlikewise say that our differences in vision and personality were \nirreconcilable, and despite hard efforts for unity, we have been \nunable to achieve it?\u0014\n\u0014\nBetter yet, why not treat organizational conflict the way C. S. Lewis \ntaught us to think about bodily painas God's megaphone. If we pay \nattention to the pain, we can learn what God might truly be saying to \na congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat kind of God-talk gives birth to discernment. But when we use \nGod-talk to paper over the truth, we risk taking the name of God in \nvain. Scripture is clear that God does not appreciate it when we \nmisuse his holy name for our purposes. Hiding behind a veneer of \nGod-talk that everyone knows is just a way of obscuring painful \nrealities invites cynicism about all our words about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we could admit that we are fallen and uncertain and that we don't \nalways know how to interpret every situation, can't always resolve \nour conflicts, and sometimes simply choose to move in new directions, \nwe could break the power of the Code and end the cynicism we create \nby misusing words about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW IS THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT LIKE \"1984\"?",
    "words": "How is the conservative movement like \"1984\"? \u0014\n\u0014\nJust got a PDF copy of Austin Bramwell's upcoming article from The \nAmerican Conservative, and it will indeed start a thousand fights. \nGood. But I have to say the finest passage to me was a lengthy one in \nwhich he outlined the four ways the conservative movement has become \nlike \"1984.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n1. \"First, like Ingsoc, conservatism has a hierarchical structure. \nLike Orwell's \"Inner Party,\" those at the top of the movement have \nalmost perfect freedom to decide what opinions count as official \nconservatism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDissent, even from conservative principles, and you face \"ostracism \nand harsh rebuke,\" writes Bramwell. And: \"Millions of conservative \nepigones believe nothing less than what the movement's established \norgans tell them to believe.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n2. \"Second, conservatism is concerned less with truth than with \ndistinguishing insiders from outsiders.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Conservatives identify themselves in part by repeating slogans (\"we \nare at war!\") that, like \"ignorance is strength,\" are less important \nfor what (if anything) thtey say than for what saying them says about \nthe speaker,\" Bramwell writes. And if you doubt the official line, \nwhether or not your doubts have merit, you are guilty of \n\"doublethink,\" and had better keep those doubts to yourself or risk \nbeing pushed to the outside of the movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. \"Third, and closely related to doublethinking, the conservative \nmovement engages in selective editing of history. When events have a \ntendency to disconfirm ideology, down the memory hole they go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDid leading conservatives claim that Iraqis would welcome us as \nliberators? That the insurgency would end once we got rid of Saddam, \nand then Zarqawi? Of course -- but, writes Bramwell, \"the ability to \nforget that any of these events ever occurred signals one's loyalty \nto the movement. (Hence, the rise of hawkishness against Iran, not \nfour years after the last effort to sell a war to an otherwise balky \npublic.)\u0014\n\u0014\n4. \"Fourth, conservatism is entertaining. Understanding the world, \nthough rewarding, provides nothing like the pleasures of a 'Two \nMinute Hate,' a focused, ritualized denunciation of enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was at a big conservative dinner earlier this year, and listened in \non a panel discussion. Among the panel was a venerable conservative \nactivist and controversialist, who weighed in with a ritual \ndenunciation of judicial activists, public school educrats, and the \nusual suspects. What stuck in my mind about the thing was not so much \nwhether she was right or wrong (and I think she was more right than \nwrong), but how stale it sounded. It was as if she believed that \nreciting the Litany of Enemies of the Right was sufficient. Maybe it \nwas, I dunno. But I know for a fact I wasn't the only conservative in \nthat room thinking, \"Is this all the Right has to offer anymore?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBack to the Two-Minute Hate, this kind of thinking is a symptom of \nwhy the conservative movement is in such trouble. If your critics and \nopponents can't possibly have a point, and are only Stupid or Evil \n(else they'd see things your way in every instance), then you \nshouldn't be surprised when you get cold-cocked by reality on \nElection Day. Which is a lesson the Democratic Party leadership has \nbeen struggling to learn for years and years.\u0014\n\u0014\nI should add that Bramwell says this ideological behavior doesn't \nhave anything to do with conservatism per se, but rather lies \"deep \nin our cognitive limitations and instinct for group loyalty. One \ncould make similar observations of any ideology.\" It's important, \nthough, to point out how ideological conservatism has become, and \nthus strayed from its roots. Writes Bramwell, \"Lexically, \n'conservatism' denotes caution, prudence, and resistance to change. \nConservatism the ideology, however, has if anything tended towards \nrecklessness\u0014",

    "title": "HISTORY OF ADVENT",
    "words": "It cannot be determined with any degree of certainty when the \ncelebration of Advent was first introduced into the Church. The \npreparation for the feast of the Nativity of Our Lord was not held \nbefore the feast itself existed, and of this we find no evidence \nbefore the end of the fourth century, when, according to Duchesne \n[Christian Worship (London, 1904), 260], it was celebrated throughout \nthe whole Church, by some on 25 December, by others on 6 January. Of \nsuch a preparation we read in the Acts of a synod held at Saragossa \nin 380, whose fourth canon prescribes that from the seventeenth of \nDecember to the feast of the Epiphany no one should be permitted to \nabsent himself from church. We have two homilies of St. Maximus, \nBishop of Turin (415-466), entitled \"In Adventu Domini\", but he makes \nno reference to a special time. The title may be the addition of a \ncopyist. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are some homilies extant, most likely of St. Caesarius, Bishop \nof Arles (502-542), in which we find mention of a preparation before \nthe birthday of Christ; still, to judge from the context, no general \nlaw on the matter seems then to have been in existence. A synod held \n(581) at Mcon, in Gaul, by its ninth canon orders that from the \neleventh of November to the Nativity the Sacrifice be offered \naccording to the Lenten rite on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the \nweek. The Gelasian Sacramentary notes five Sundays for the season; \nthese five were reduced to four by Pope St. Gregory VII (1073-85). \nThe collection of homilies of St. Gregory the Great (590-604) begins \nwith a sermon for the second Sunday of Advent. In 650 Advent was \ncelebrated in Spain with five Sundays. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral synods had made laws about fasting to be observed during this \ntime, some beginning with the eleventh of November, others the \nfifteenth, and others as early as the autumnal equinox. Other synods \nforbade the celebration of matrimony. In the Greek Church we find no \ndocuments for the observance of Advent earlier than the eighth \ncentury. St. Theodore the Studite (d. 826), who speaks of the feasts \nand fasts commonly celebrated by the Greeks, makes no mention of this \nseason. In the eighth century we find it observed not as a liturgical \ncelebration, but as a time of fast and abstinence, from 15 November \nto the Nativity, which, according to Goar, was later reduced to seven \ndays. But a council of the Ruthenians (1720) ordered the fast \naccording to the old rule from the fifteenth of November. This is the \nrule with at least some of the Greeks. Similarly, the Ambrosian and \nthe Mozarabic rites have no special liturgy for Advent, but only the \nfast.\u0014\n---Catholic Encyclopedia\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Roman world, advent (Latin, Adventus) meant, in the most \nbasic sense, coming or arrival. At the same time, the arrival of \na Roman Emperor, particularly following military victory, was also \nknown as an Adventus.  This was the moment when Roman subjects \ncould celebrateusually at the city gatethe favour of the gods in \ngranting triumph to their leaders, and salvation to the general \npopulace.\u0014\n\u0014\n For their part, Roman Christians identified the birth of Jesus with \na mid-winter pagan festival that marked the return of light to their \ndarkened world.  Thereafter, they established a period named Advent \nin order to prepare for this annual celebration of the Coming of \ntheir Lord.   For they too wished to commemorate a Saviour whom God \nhad favoured and blessed with victory. \u0014\n\u0014\n In this sense, the season of Advent serves as a reminder that the \nlife of Christian faith is lived in light of Christs coming into the \nworld, and in expectation of His ultimate return.  The articles in \nthis issue reflect, in various ways, this central dynamic of \nChristian discipleship: because Jesus, the Son of God, has come among \nus, life can never be the same.  I invite you to explore the various \nways in which these articles reflect, and reflect upon, the \nimplications and obligations of the Advent of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nM.

    "words": "HAPPINESS AND RELIGION\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Does religion make people happy? Is there a relationship\u0014\n         between faith and euphoria? Religious research has examined\u0014\n         how faith and spirituality affect the experimental constructs\u0014\n         developed by happiness researchers. One facet of happiness \ncalled\u0014\n         Quality of Life has been linked to frequency of religious \nservice atten-\u0014\n         dance. Individuals who never attended religious services had \n1.87 times\u0014\n         the risk of dying in the follow-up period than those who \nattended\u0014\n         services once per week or more.This was true even when \ncontrolling for\u0014\n         age, sex, race, region of the country, activity limitation, \nincome, educa-\u0014\n         tion, marital status, social ties and medical risk factors \nsuch as smoking\u0014\n         and being overweight (Hummer, Rogers, Nam,& Elison, \n1999/2002).\u0014\n\u0014\n           There is also a positive correlation between weekly \nreligious activ-\u0014\n         ity and better health and well-being, and this effect is \nstronger for men\u0014\n         than for women.When public religious activity, private \nreligious activity,\u0014\n         and spiritual experiences were considered separately, public \nreligious\u0014\n         activity was the best predictor of health and well-being \namong men. In\u0014\n         women, both public religious activity and spiritual \nexperiences showed\u0014\n         more positive physical and psychological outcomes than \ninvolvement\u0014\n         in private religious activity, but the magnitude of the \neffect was less\u0014\n         than that in men (Maselko & Kubzansky, 2006).\u0014\n\u0014\n         Religious affiliation also appears related to happiness.Those\u0014\n         who state no denominational preference are less happy than \nthose\u0014\n         who do claim a particular faith as their own. Practicing \nJews are\u0014\n         more likely than practicing Catholics or Protestants to say \nthey are\u0014\n         unhappy, and Evangelicals report slightly more happiness than\u0014\n         Fundamentalists. Liberals and those claiming no doctrinal \nallegiance\u0014\n         report lower levels of happiness than Jews, Catholics, \nProtestants,\u0014\n         Evangelicals or Fundamentalists (Ferriss, 2002). \nCongregational sup-\u0014\n         port and public practice of religion are more closely \nassociated with\u0014\n         higher levels of life satisfaction than other aspects of \nreligion, and\u0014\n         this is true across faiths. Spirituality, religious coping \nand religious\u0014\n         belief all predict happiness more strongly for Christians \nthan for Jews\u0014\n         (A. B. Cohen, 2002).\u0014\n\u0014\n           Another interesting aspect of the relationship between \nspiritual-\u0014\n         ity and happiness concerns how people internalize their \nimage of\u0014\n         God. Some view God as benevolent and involved, others think \nof God\u0014\n         as a judge who punishes wrong behavior.Those who perceive \nnega-\u0014\n         tive life changes as punishment from God or as a spiritual \nthreat have\u0014\n         more unpleasant life experiences than those who see God \nprimarily\u0014\n         as a protective force (Pargament et al., 1990/2006). \nIndividuals who\u0014\n         have a positive image of God tend to have more positive \naffect in\u0014\n         general, and those who see God as controlling have lower \nlife-sat-\u0014\n         isfaction both in the momentary sense and in the broader \narena of\u0014\n         Subjective Well-Being (Wiegand & Weiss, 2006).\u0014\n\u0014\n         Religious research has also produced the helpful distinction\u0014\n         between intrinsic and extrinsic religion. Intrinsic religion \ninvolves the\u0014\n         internalized, personal and integrative aspects of faith, \nwhile extrinsic\u0014\n         religion refers to the external, social, and obligatory \nelements of reli-\u0014\n         gious involvement. Another way of conceptualizing this \ndifference\u0014\n         is that extrinsically religious people see faith activities \nas something\u0014\n         they do whereas intrinsically religious individuals view \ntheir religious\u0014\n         practice as part of who they are.Those who score higher on \nmeasures\u0014\n         of intrinsic religiosity have higher levels of self-reported \nhappiness than\u0014\n         extrinsically religious individuals (Lewis, Maltby,& Day, \n2005).\u0014\n\u0014\n           Spiritual Well-Being (SpWB) is a construct that measures \npurpose,\u0014\n         relationships, love,justice, faith in humanity, a sense of \nunity and awe\u0014\n         with nature, and belief in a source of mystery in the \nuniverse. SpWB\u0014\n         has been studied as a measure of personal, communal, environ-\u0014\n         mental and transcendental happiness and the SpWB \nQuestionnaire,\u0014\n         which purports to measure this construct, has been found to \ncor-\u0014\n         relate positively with extraversion and happiness and \nnegatively\u0014\n         with neuroticism and psychoticism (Gomez & Fisher, 2005). \nAnother\u0014\n         connection between happiness and religion is the finding \nthat ado-\u0014\n         lescents with higher levels of spirituality have lower rates \nof risky\u0014\n         health behaviors and fewer mental health problems. Spiritual \nteens\u0014\n         are also able to manage symptoms of physical illness using \nspiritual\u0014\n         resources better than their less religious counterparts \n(Sinha, Cnaan,\u0014\n         & Gelles, in press).\u0014\n\u0014\n         Religious identity, like psychological identity, appears con-\u0014\n         nected to happiness. One question brought up by this \nconnection\u0014\n         is whether a well-defined religious self-image reflects \nsocial con-\u0014\n         nectedness within a religious community or the feeling of \nsafety\u0014\n         that comes from knowing what you believe to be morally right.\u0014\n         Or is religious identity a subset of psychological identity, \nwith the\u0014\n         connection to happiness being more about identity than \nreligion?\u0014\n         Although theologians have seen human happiness as being \nwithin\u0014\n         their purview for centuries, the scientific study of \nreligion is a fairly\u0014\n         recent phenomenon.The psychology of happiness is helping mod-\u0014\n         ern researchers take a fresh look at the deep human need to \nfind\u0014\n         meaning and spiritual connection.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         REFERENCES\u0014\n         \u0014\n         COHEN, A.

    "title": "HOW A KING BECAME A FORD AND A NON-ELECTED PRESIDENT",
    "words": "How a King became a Ford and a non-elected President\u0014\nReviewer:\tLawrance M. Bernabo \u0014\n   \u0014\nI have a pet theory that the first vote you cast for the office of \nPresident of the United States is key to how you will vote for the \nrest of your life. In other words, every vote is an extension of or a \nreaction to that original vote. I case my first vote in 1976 for \nGerald R. Ford and the key factor was that here was a man who had not \nrun for president. Selected by Richard Nixon and the Congress of the \nUnited States to replaced Spiro Agnew as Vice President, Ford assumed \nthe presidency when Nixon resigned because of the Watergate cover up. \nConsequently, there has always been part of me that has wanted to \ndisqualify everybody who wants to be president. Granted, it makes it \nimpossible to vote for anybody, but I still think on some level that \nif you want to be president you should not be allowed to hold the \noffice (However, this is not as far-fetched as it sounds: the current \noccupant of the White House did not want to be president, but rather \nCommissioner of Baseball).\u0014\n\u0014\nGerald Rudolph Ford, the 38th President of the United States, was \nactually born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., but his parents separated two \nweeks after his birth and when his mother married Gerald R. Ford, a \npaint salesman in Grand Rapids, Michigan, they changed the boy's name \nand we avoided having a King become President. Ford tells the story \nof his life in simple and rather unembellished terms. When he was 17 \nhe had a chance meeting with his biological father apparently devoid \nof sentiment or significance. How he relates the incident is \nrepresentative of the way that Ford presents his life's story, with \nrestraint and without tooting his own horn. The things for which he \nhas been honored throughout his life, from being an All-American \nfootball player at the University of Michigan to being honored by \nPresident Jimmy Carter in his inaugural address for all he had done \nto heal the nation in the wake of Watergate, are taken in stride. \nConsequently, \"A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford\" \nis as much a testament to the man's character as it is a memoir of \nhis life in and out of politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nFord covers the major episodes of his life, growing up in Michigan, \nbeing an Eagle Scout, playing at Michigan and turning down offers to \nplay professional football to attend Yale Law School instead. During \nWorld War II Ford served in the Navy on the U.S.S. Monterey, a light \naircraft carrier. After the war he practiced law and then won a seat \nin the U.S. House of Representatives in 1948. It was during that \ncampaign that he married Elizabeth Ann Bloomer Warren. Ford was \nre-elected to Congress a dozen times, always getting over 60% of the \nvote. Rejecting opportunities to run for the Senate or the Michigan \ngovernorship, Ford's ambition was to become Speaker of the House. He \ndescribed himself as \"a moderate in domestic affairs, an \ninternationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal \npolicy,\" and was considered a \"reform\" Republican.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat becomes interesting in looking at Ford's career in Congress is \nto see the reputation he established with his colleagues as House \nMinority leader, so that when the scandal plagued Nixon \nAdministration needed someone who was totally clean to become \nVice-President, there was no opposition to Ford. I think the biggest \nmistake in the entire run of \"The West Wing\" was the notion that the \nCongress would have not only confirmed but pushed somebody like Bob \nRussell for Vice President. In selecting Ford to replace Agnew, and \nthen selecting Nelson Rockerfeller to in turn replace Ford, Congress \nmade sure the person a heart beat away from the presidency was \nqualified, even given the political complications. But even such \ncreative fiction only serves to emphasize the respect his colleagues \nhad for Ford.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of the Ford Presidency this autobiography does focus on the \nkey episodes from the pardon of Nixon (I always thought it was the \nright thing to do) and the capture of the U.S.S. Mayaguez to the two \nassassination attempts, his \"Whip Inflation Now\" policy and the 1976 \npresidential campaign. After holding off a strong challenge from \nRonald Reagan in the Republican primaries, Ford and his running mate \nSenator Bob Dole succeeded in narrowing the gap on Jimmy Carter, but \nlost in a close election. One of the key moments in the debates was \nwhen Ford was castigated for suggesting that the Poles did not think \nthey were under Soviet domination. Ironically, it was in Poland that \nthe first major cracks in the Communist bloc took place and in \nretrospect Ford was apparently more right than anybody at the time \never guessed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose looking for major revelations and profound insights will not \nfind them here. This is a relatively simple man, laying out the \npublic record more out of a sense of obligation, because history \ndemands such things, than out of a need to justify what he has done \n(cf. Johnson, Nixon, Clinton). While trying to be open about his \npersonal life, he clearly remains a private man. If you remember how \nhe spoke, both in his speeches and in his conversations, you can \n\"hear\" Ford's voice as you read this book. So while this is not the \nmost revealing or insightful of presidential autobiographies, it does \nprovide Ford's side of the story, and you will have the sense that it \nis one of the most honest.\u0014",

    "words": "Southwestern Baptist's board chair calls hiring a \"momentary lax of \nthe parameters.\"\u0014\nGreg Horton, Religion News Service | posted 1/23/2007 08:43AM\u0014\n\u0014\nA pastor and influential blogger has accused Paige Patterson, \npresident of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and past \npresident of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), of gender \ndiscrimination in denying tenure to a female former faculty member at \nthe Fort Worth, Texas, seminary.\u0014\nRelated articles and links\u0014\n\u0014\nThe allegations were made on the personal blog of Wade Burleson, a \npastor in Enid, Okla., who gained attention in Southern Baptist \ncircles last year when he challenged the denomination's ban on \nmissionaries who speak in tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurleson alleged that Patterson had promised Sherri Klouda, who \ntaught Hebrew, that she would stay on faculty after he was appointed \npresident in 2003, but later refused to grant her tenure.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurleson alleged that Patterson dismissed Klouda because of his \nstrict interpretation of key biblical passages  particularly that \nthe Bible prohibits women from teaching men in the areas of theology \nand biblical studies.\u0014\n\u0014\nT. Van McClain, chair of Southwestern's board of trustees, released a \nstatement calling Burleson's blog entry \"filled with inaccuracies\" \nand denied that Klouda was dismissed. \"Actually, she did not have \ntenure and, like hundreds of professors around the U.S. every year, \nwas told that she would not be awarded tenure,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcClain also denied that gender discrimination played a role in \nKlouda's dismissal: \"The second issue involves the desire of (the \nseminary) to have only men teaching who are qualified to be pastors \nor who have been pastors in the disciplines of theology, biblical \nstudies, homiletics, and pastoral ministry. This is in keeping, of \ncourse, with the statement of faith of the SBC that clearly says the \npastorate is reserved for men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMcClain said the school was free to hire only men for these \npositions, saying, \"It is a matter of freedom of religion in this \ncountry for a private institution to align itself with the majority \nviews of its constituency.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMcClain called Klouda's hiring a \"momentary lax of the parameters\" \nand said the school has now returned to \"its traditional, \nconfessional, and biblical position.\" He added that the seminary \n\"agreed to continue [McClain's] support after her teaching \nresponsibilities were over, so her family would have financial \nsupport. The seminary went far beyond anything that could be \nexpressed as its duty or responsibility.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKlouda, who has since obtained a position at Taylor University in \nIndiana, did not return calls for comment, but told The Dallas \nMorning News, \"I don't think it was right to hire me to do this job, \nto put me in the position where I, in good faith, assumed that I was \nworking toward tenure, and then suddenly remove me without any cause \nother than gender.\"\u0014",

    "words": "How Faith Happens\u0014\nA winsome memoir of doubt and perplexity and blessed assurance.\u0014\nReviewed by Craig E. Mattson \u0014\nBeautiful Evidence\u0014\n\u0014\nConfessions of an Amateur Believer\u0014\nBy Patty Kirk\u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor whose opinion mattered most to me in college is \nretiring. I'm finding my note of appreciation hard to writeand not \njust because he was my instructor in advanced grammar. For all he \ntaught me about language, I never had an easy conversation with him \nabout the simplest, everyday thing. He was a constant perplexity to \nme, his eye kindly but quizzical, missing and revealing nothing. A \nnew memoir by another advanced composition teacher, Patty Kirk's \nConfessions of an Amateur Believer, has made me think I should ask my \nteacher to write his memoirs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe discipline of grammar is historically aligned with the study of \nrhetoric, a subject that fascinates Kirk, at least in the sense that \nher book develops a phenomenology of persuasion: the everyday, \nnon-expert, experience of people who believe and disbelieve by turns. \nIt's a theme not unfamiliar to readers of other memoirists, Buechner, \nNorris, and Dillard among them. Kirk's memoir shares their emphasis \non everydayness and their alertness to the obstacles to belief. Like \nthem, she knows what it is to doubt the love of God: her bout with \nunbelief lasted more than half of her adulthood so far. Like them, \nshe knows what it is to doubt the love of neighbor: her experience of \nsexual assault left her lastingly leery of uncompassionate \nChristians. But unlike her best-known counterparts, she emerges from \nher experiences a curiously conservative evangelical, who reads her \nBible every morning and goes to a non-denominational church where \n\"the French roll and grape juice we share only symbolize Jesus' body \nand blood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven for unbelievers, close attention to the quotidian requires a \nkind of sacramental sense of the world. Kirk's memoir emerges from a \nlapsed Catholicism that doesn't believe the too-large chunks of bread \nher daughters tear off at the Lord's Supper are actually means of \ngrace. Communion, she says in her essay, \"In Memory of Him,\" \"is \nsimply a medium for reminding myself about redemption.\" Even so, she \nhas a good ear for the earthy guesses that children make about sex, a \nclear eye for the complex relations of farmers and barns, a \nsacramental feel for what red ink signifies to her grammar students. \nFor all this redemptive remembering, one narrative habit of Kirk's, I \nthink, keeps her from opening the present as well as she might have.\u0014\n\u0014\nConfessions of an Amateur Believer divides into four sectionsMeeting \nGod, Struggles, Progress, and Restwhose essays, early and late, open \nwith conflict and work towards resolution. But Kirk's insistence that \nevery chapter end in believing insight gives her memoir a sometimes \nover-the-shoulder quality. We often hear what her future self will \nsay (would say? is saying?) to her past disbelieving self from the \nvantage of an arrived-at insight. I wish that Kirk would relinquish, \nnow and then, the classical narrative style of conflict, struggle, \nresolution, and denouement. If some chapters ended, for example, with \nlament, the book might allow more clearing for that grace that comes \napart from struggle, in spite of struggle, the grace that comes when \nwe simply take and eat.\u0014\n\u0014\nComedian Steven Wright used to say he liked to reminisce with people \nhe didn't know. But it's no joke to say that Kirk's memoir covers \nhistory that hasn't happened yet. She's enough of a humorist (see \nespecially her piece \"Blind Drivers\") to appreciate the paradox. Her \nhumor sometimes achieves a religious vision, a vision that guides her \nown vocation as an English professor and gathers up the tribulations \nof other composition teachersmy professor's included. I think of him \nnow with his long fingers perpetually shuffling and re-shuffling our \nunripe essays as they overtook his desk. He must have known precisely \nthe fear that one of Kirk's final essays describes, the \"fear that we \nwill lose what we are working for or never get done.\" Her answer to \nthis fear is a hope straight out of the book of Amos, an intimation \nof the Day of the Lord \"when the reaper will be overtaken by the \nplowman and the planter by the one treading grapes.\" Kirk glosses \nAmos' prophetic dream envisioning workers \"getting in one another's \nway, always having to stop and laugh, eating bread and fruit and \ndrinking wine and exchanging jokes and stories as they worked.\" Her \nmemoir shows us that when we exchange jokes and stories, allowing our \npast and present to get in each other's way, we can find our way into \na rich imaginary for work and rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nCraig E. Mattson is assistant professor of communication arts at \nTrinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Books & Culture. Click for reprint information.\u0014",

    "title": "HEYDRICH--THE FACE OF EVIL    A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Review by Gerhard Weinberg\u0014\n\u0014\nIn view of the important role that Reinhard Heydrich played in Nazi \nGermany's police system, the persecution and subsequent killing of \nJews, and in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, it is astonishing that \n35 years have passed since a truly serious study of this figure has \nappeared. In this case the German author died before his work was in \nfinal form, but fortunately a colleague polished and published the \nbook, and a capable translator has turned the German text into \nreadable and fascinating English.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are offered here an impressive and reliable account of Heydrich's \nfamily background, his youth, and his service in the German navy. The \nevents surrounding his dismissal from the navy are treated with the \nneeded care. Readers will see how a young man of ambition rose \nrapidly within the police structure of National Socialist Germany and \nhow his close personal ties with police chief Heinrich Himmler \ndeveloped and influenced the career of the man widely seen at the \ntime as his probable successor. Like Himmler, Heydrich had an \nobsession about the persecution of Jews and came to be in a position \nto translate that obsession into action. His role in the great pogrom \nof November 1938, generally referred to as Crystal Night, is \nilluminated here. It was Heydrich who organized the murder squads \n(Einsatzgruppen) who accompanied the German military in their \ninvasions of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union. In this \nlast case he attained a central position in the implementation of the \nso-called Final Solution of the Jewish Problem. As that program of \nsystematic murder went forward, it was appropriate that he chaired \nthe notorious Wannsee Conference of January 1942 in which the wide \nrange of German government agencies was provided with their \nintroduction to participation in the European portion of the project \nto kill all Jews on the face of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe assignment of Heydrich to the rule of German-occupied Bohemia and \nMoravia, the central part of today's Czech Republic, was to give him \nan opportunity to demonstrate his administrative skills. The reader \nwill find here a short account of Heydrich's rule from Prague and his \n1942 assassination. There is also a detailed report on the horrific \nreprisals by the Germans that took more than 15,000 lives and \nincluded the notorious razing of the town of Lidice. A thoughtful \nanalysis of Heydrich's character and career is followed by a section \nthat traces the fates of his family in the postwar years. This last \npart is an instructive view of how the relatives of the man in whose \nhonor the mass murder of Polish Jews was named Operation Reinhard \nsaw and conducted themselves in postwar Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis carefully researched and presented report on a very important \nfigure in Nazi Germany, its structure, and its crimes was hailed in \nits German edition by the famous German scholar Eberhard Jaeckel as \nthe best biography of Heydrich up to now. This is a judgement that \nwill be shared by both general readers and specialists with an \ninterest in Nazi Germany and in the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u0014\nMario R. Dederichs was Bonn, Moscow, and Washington correspondent for \nGermany's Stern magazine. Teja Fielder, who has written a preface to \nthis edition, was a long-standing colleague and friend of the author, \nand is a correspondent at Stern.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER:\u0014\nGerhard L. Weinberg, William Rand Kenan, Jr., Professor of History \nEmeritus at the University of North Carolina, is the author of The \nForeign Policy of Hitler's Germany and A World At Arms: A Global \nHistory of World War II.

Never mind. Neither is \nrepresentative of the book itself, which is well written, \nentertaining, and likely to be of particular interest to readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf not the most famous man in America, Henry Ward Beecher sprang from \nthe celebrated clan that produced the distinguished churchman Lyman \nBeecher (his father) and the novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe (his \nsister), author of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Born in 1813, Henry Ward \nBeecher became a spellbinding preacher. A little more than a decade \nbefore his death in 1887, though, he weathered a sex-scandal as \ntawdry in its own way as the Clinton-Lewinsky affairmanaging, like \nthe President, to brazen it out, though his reputation was \npermanently tarnished.\u0014\n\u0014\nApplegate exaggerates the extent to which Beecher's emphasis on God's \nunconditional love was a novelty and mischaracterizes the religious \nlandscape in other ways (for example, you'd never intuit from her \naccount the perfectionist strain in early Methodism that led to the \nHoliness movement). Still, she's one of those rare writers who manage \nto combine in a single book the virtues of scholarly and popular \nbiography, immersing themselves in the archives without losing the \nhuman touch.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's a powerful temptation to use a fall such as Beecher's as an \narguing point. All too many preachers of the Word, obscure as well as \nfamous, representing wildly contradictory theologies and churches of \nevery stripe, have fallen prey to temptation. Let us give thanks for \nthe many more pastors and priests who, with God's grace, have stayed \non the path.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW CHRISTIANS SHOULD RESPOND TO HOLOCAUST DENIAL",
    "words": "Addressing Abomination\u0014\nHow Christians should respond to Holocaust denial.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Marc Gellman\u0014\n\u0014\nDec. 26, 2006 - The Bible has many names for what we call sin. At the \ntop of the sin hierarchy is a Hebrew word, toevah, which is most \noften translated as abomination. An abomination is not just wrong, \nnot just sinful. It is a knowing and ruthless corruption. The recent \nHolocaust-deniers meeting convened by Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad was not a conference, it was an abomination in the full \nbiblical sense of the word.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is who ought to have the primary responsibility for \ncorrecting this abomination? I think it ought to be Christians, and \nnot Jews, who lead the way in reasserting the truth of genocide.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican blacks do not need to understand the institution of slavery \nin the United States. Whites do. They need to try to comprehend how \notherwise decent people could buy and sell human beings, like one \nmight buy or sell chickens or pigs. How could anyone do this and \nstill go to church and pray to God to bless their families? Selling \nanother human being is not just a mistake. It is an abomination. \nAmerican blacks understand slavery already. Slavery in the United \nStates is a white problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is true about slavery is also true about the Holocaust. The \nfirst response to Holocaust denial is almost always sought, or \nreflexively offered, from one or another Jewish organization. This is \nwrong. The Holocaust was a terrible wound for the Jewish people, but \nit is a supreme challenge to Christians, who need to understand how \notherwise decent people could gas and burn and starve and torture and \nbury alive other human beings just because they were Jews or gypsies \nor homosexuals or socialists. How could a cultured people, the people \nof Beethoven and Goethe, do this and still go to church and pray to \nGod to bless their families? Committing genocide is not just a \nmistake. It is an abomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nJews understand the Holocaust because one out of every three Jews who \nwere alive in 1933 had been murdered by 1945. Six million dead out of \n18 million. For Jews to respond to Holocaust denial is humiliating \nand ineffective. Christians must say that it happened and explain as \nbest they can why it happened and why it must never happen again. The \nChristians who must fight the abomination in Tehran are not guilty. \nThey are not the killers, and most of them are not the children or \neven the grandchildren of the killers. They must explain it, because \nthe Holocaust was an abomination committed by Christians against Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians must also fight Holocaust denial because they must \nunderstand that if it gains one iota in credibility among the merely \nsemi-lunatic members of our world, as opposed to the fully lunatic \nones who participated in the conference in Tehran, then something \nimportant will be broken in our moral calculus. If the Holocaust can \nbe denied, then there is no radical evil that cannot be ignored. If \nAuschwitz was merely a detention stop for a few healthy Jewish \nworkers, then the idea that the CIA was behind 9/11 suddenly seems \nreasonable. If the overwhelming historical documentation of genocide \nand mass murder means nothing at all, then we are all lost. If the \nHolocaust never occurred, then perhaps Rwanda and Bosnia and Cambodia \nand Uganda and Darfur and Biafra and the Gulags also never occurred, \nor at the very least all of them ought to be subjected to analysis by \nmadmen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHolocaust denial is not about Jews, it is about the truth, and \nsupporting and defending the truth cannot be the burden of the Jewish \npeople alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nHolocaust denial must also be of primary significance to Christians, \nbecause now there is no difference between Jew hatred and Christian \nhatred. In the war against jihadism there is no difference any longer \nbetween being a Christian and being a Jew. When it was Christians \nkilling Jews, we were separated by hatred. Now that it is Muslim \nfanatics killing Christians and Jews, we are united by hatred. And we \nare united with atheists and all freedom-loving people everywhere who \ndo not want to see the world ruled by these fanatics' version of \nSharia law. It is no coincidence that the convener of the Holocaust \ndeniers is also the greatest threat to world peace. To believe in an \nabomination is the first step to committing an abomination.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2007 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

GO!\" What an \nexuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started \nwaving and smiling at all these loving people. \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nI even honked my horn a few times to share in the love.

    "words": "\"Staying here is like committing suicide.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKARAR ALAA, a medical student in Iraq, on the plans of many students \nto leave the country after earning their degrees.\u0014\n \u0014\n                                                     Cheated of \nFuture, Iraqi Graduates Want to Flee\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DAMIEN CAVE\u0014\nPublished: June 5, 2007\u0014\n\u0014\nBAGHDAD, June 4  They started college just before or after the \nAmerican invasion with dreams of new friends and parties, brilliant \nteachers and advanced degrees that would lead to stellar jobs, \nmarriage and children. Success seemed well within their grasp.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 13, students walked around large barriers of concrete placed \naround Mustansiriya University to protect against car bomb attacks. \nThe university has been the target of a number of such attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nMen carried a student at the economics and administration college of \nMustansiriya University in Baghdad who had been wounded in a suicide \nbomb attack in February.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years later, Iraqs college graduates are ending their studies \nshattered and eager to leave the country. In interviews with more \nthan 30 students from seven universities, all but four said they \nhoped to flee immediately after receiving their degrees. Many said \nthey did not expect Iraq to stabilize for at least a decade.\u0014\n\u0014\nI used to dream about getting a Ph.D., participating in \ninternational conferences, belonging to a team that discovered cures \nfor diseases like AIDS, leaving my fingerprint on medicine, said \nHasan Tariq Khaldoon, 24, a pharmacy student in Mosul, in the north. \nNow all these dreams have evaporated.\u0014\n\u0014\nKarar Alaa, 25, a medical student at Babil University, south of \nBaghdad, said, Staying here is like committing suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe class of 2007 came of age during a transformation that according \nto students has harvested tragedy from seeds of hope. They are the \nlast remnants of a middle class that has already fled by the tens of \nthousands. As such they embody the countrys progression from \ninnocence to bitter wisdom amid dashed expectations and growing \nanimosity toward the Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey said would leave their country feeling betrayed, by the \ndebilitating violence that has killed scores of professors and \nfriends, by the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism and by \nthe Americans, who they say cracked open their country, releasing \nspasms of violence without protecting the moderate institutions that \ncould have been a bulwark against extremism.\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to tell them thanks for liberating us, but enough with the \nmistakes, said Abdul Hassein Ibrahim Zain Alabidin, a Shiite Turkmen \nstudying law at Kirkuk University, in the north. The errors, he said, \nled to division and terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIraqs roughly 56,000 graduates began their college careers under far \ndifferent circumstances. With the worlds strongest power expected to \ndemocratize and modernize their country, they said, they felt \nspecial, chosen, about to be famous on the worldwide stage.\u0014\n\u0014\nI thought we would be like stars, said Ahmed Saleh Abdul Khader, \n21, a biology student in the southern city of Basra.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was thinking that Iraq would be like Las Vegas, especially Kirkuk, \nwhich has oil, Mr. Alabidin said. Instead, after an initial period \nof hope after the overthrow of Saddam Husseins government, the \nstudents said they watched in awe as Iraqs underlying sectarian and \nethnic conflicts emerged and flourished.\u0014\nVideo\u0014\nMore Video \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the countrys 21 universities, the decline started with chaos. \nLooters stole ancient artifacts and destroyed buildings at Basra \nUniversity, for instance, only days after British troops reached the \narea in 2003.\u0014\n\u0014\nViolence followed. In June 2004, a geography professor at the \nUniversity of Baghdad was killed after leaving the campus. He would \nnot be the last.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeve lost over 200 professors, being killed, said Abed Thiab \nal-Ajili, Iraqs minister of higher education. A number of others \nhave been kidnapped.\u0014\n\u0014\nScores more have fled, he said, leading the perpetually upbeat Mr. \nAjili to spend much of his time trying to persuade those still here \nto stay. It is a particularly difficult task; in November, dozens of \nministry employees were kidnapped in broad daylight by gunmen wearing \npolice uniforms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm not going to say we are in a good position, Mr. Ajili said. We \nare surviving. We are trying our best to have an educational system \nto be as good as we can.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents said Iraqs university system had significantly declined, \ndragged down by chronically canceled lectures and decrepit equipment, \nall in an atmosphere of growing terror and violence.\u0014",

If Christ has not risen, we have no proof that \nthe crucifixion of Jesus differed from that of the two thieves who \nsuffered with him. If Christ has not risen, it is impossible to \nbelieve his atoning death was accepted.\u0014\n\u0014\nIF THE FIRST Christians had not believed that Christ rose from the \ndead there would have been no church and no New Testament . If \nChristianity had been founded merely on the moral teaching of Jesus, \nit would no doubt have flourished for a short time as a well-meaning \ndeviation from orthodox Judaism. It would quickly have lost its \nidentity amid the innumerable varieties of religion and philosophy \nwhich occupied the minds of the ancient world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIN THE RESURRECTION of Jesus from the dead, we see God's decisive \nvictory not only over death but over all God's other enemies as well. \nIn that one climactic event, we see the certainty that someday, in \nthe kingdom of God, there will be no more violence, war, jealousy, or \ndeath . These forces are still alive and at work in the world, but \nbecause of the victory that God won at Easter, their doom is certain.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHERE ARE TIMES when I feel that he has withdrawn from me, and I have \noften given him cause, but Easter is always the answer to My God, my \nGod, why hast thou forsaken me!\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE GREAT JOY that the disciples felt when they saw the risen Lord, \nthat \"burning of heart\" that they experienced on the way to Emmaus, \nwere not because the mysteries of an \"other world\" were revealed to \nthem, but because they saw the Lord .

    "title": "HOPE FOR VANISHED MOTHER",
    "words": "September 22, 2007, New York Times \u0014\nSearch for Vanished Mother Yields Faded Bit of Hope \u0014\nBy MICHELLE YORK \u0014\n\u0014\nNEWARK, N.Y.  When people disappear, they tend to do it all at once. \nBut not Judith A. Geurin; she began to fade from her middle-class \nexistence gradually. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt began in the summer of 1988 after her husband, Joseph, died of a \nheart attack at the age of 57. \u0014\nIn the raw stages of grief, Mrs. Geurin  a woman who had never been \nknown to drink  lost a piece of herself amid the liquor bottles that \nbegan cluttering her four-bedroom colonial-style house in Cohoes, a \nsmall town about 15 miles north of Albany. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen she disengaged from family gatherings and other motherly \nobligations in favor of neighborhood bars. She eventually left her \nchildren for a new man.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith her eldest child already married and with a family of his own, \ncare of the other children fell to the next oldest, Amy, the only \ndaughter. Although only 17 when her father died, she reshaped her \nplans for the future and eventually took charge of her three younger \nbrothers. She was angry with her mother, but believed that someday \nshe would return. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat is when Mrs. Geurin disappeared completely.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything was terrible, said the daughter, now Amy Kusaywa, 36. \nThere must have been a part of her I didnt know.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeekly phone calls to her children stopped abruptly in the winter of \n1991, and no one has heard from Mrs. Geurin since. Nor has any \npaperwork, like a federal tax return or a claim for Social Security \nbenefits, surfaced that would offer proof of a life elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, Ms. Kusaywa has been trying to piece together clues about \nher mothers life and disappearance. Her journey has taken her across \nthe state, and into uncharted emotional territory. It has turned her \ninto a forgiving daughter and amateur detective.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver time, she has come to believe that her mother was killed. \nAlthough the local police initially dismissed her theories, she has \nconvinced them that they should investigate her mothers \ndisappearance for the first time. They are now interviewing people \nwho might have information. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one was even looking for Judy Geurin until the fall of last year, \nwhen we received a phone call from Amy, said Lt. Bob Hetzke, an \ninvestigator with the Wayne County Sheriffs Office. Now down in my \nheart, I think its a 98 or 99 percent chance there was a homicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore Ms. Kusaywa began her search, she combed through her memories \nof the mother she thought she knew. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I say this woman didnt drink when I was growing up, I mean she \ndidnt have a glass of wine at the holidays, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor did her parents appear to be unhappy with each other or their \nlives. Her father worked long hours as a sergeant for the Albany \nCounty Sheriffs Department. His overtime pay was enough to keep the \nfamily in an upper-middle-class existence. Mrs. Geurin kept busy with \nthe house and the children. \u0014\nWe were very close, Ms. Kusaywa said. I never thought she wasnt \nhappy. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Geurin, who died in July 1988, left more than $250,000 in life \ninsurance and pension funds. Mrs. Geurin, 42 at the time, registered \nfor college that fall to become a respiratory therapist. But she had \nbegun to drink heavily, Ms. Kusaywa said, and once confided that she \nhad married too young and had not had the chance to live her own life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mrs. Geurins life began to spiral downward, her daughter had to \ngrow up fast. Instead of college, she opted for an eight-month \ncosmetology program that would enable her to earn a living.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Geurin sold the family home in January 1989 and bought a \ntwo-family duplex in a gritty neighborhood in nearby Troy with false \npromises that she would pay the mortgage. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut then she had the movers put her belongings in a separate truck, \nwhich is how her children learned she would be living with her new \ncompanion and not them. Ms. Kusaywa filed for custody of her three \nyounger brothers that fall and was awarded custody in April 1990.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was angry and depressed, said Ms. Kusaywa, who was 20 at the \ntime. But in a way, it was a relief because she wasnt around \nanymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a few months, Mrs. Geurin and the man she was living with, \nCurtis M. Pucci, moved almost 200 miles west to Sodus Point, a small \nLake Ontario community near Rochester. By then, she had spent the \nmoney her husband had left. She and Mr. Pucci, a restaurant worker, \nlived in a trailer, and Mrs. Geurin found a job at a motel and \nrestaurant a few miles south in Newark.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore long, her daughter said, Mrs. Geurin ran into trouble with the \nlaw. She was charged with writing two bad checks and driving while \nintoxicated. In one of her last phone calls she sounded upset. She \nsaid, I feel really stupid,  Ms. Kusaywa said. I told her, If \nyou come back, we can start over.  \u0014\nBut she never heard from her mother again. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Kusaywa contacted the authorities, who said that her mother had \nprobably fled to avoid prosecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrustrated by what she felt was a lack of initiative by the police, \nshe began her own search. She has continued it on and off for the \nlast 16 years, while forging a new career with FedEx, raising two \nsons and marrying, like her mother, a policeman with the Albany \nCounty Sheriffs Department.\u0014\nAs she gathered information, a disturbing portrait emerged.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Kusaywa found perhaps 20 people who knew her mother. Some said \nthat Mr. Pucci had abused Mrs. Geurin and that he had sold her \njewelry and the trailer shortly after her disappearance. She seemed \nscared, depressed, like she wanted out but didnt know how, said \nTyna Layton, a former bartender at the Franklin House, a local \nhangout frequented by the couple.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast summer, after Ms. Kusaywa pressed the police and gave them her \nvoluminous notes, they opened a missing persons investigation and \ninterviewed many of the people that she had found. Still, progress \nhas been slow. We dont have the resources to jump in with both feet \nand go for it, Lieutenant Hetzke said.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigators interviewed Mr. Pucci, who is serving a 12-year \nsentence at Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Ulster County for \nassault and criminal possession of a weapon, but he declined to \nanswer questions and asked for a lawyer. The police have not named \nhim as a suspect in Mrs. Geurins disappearance. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Kusaywas goal is to find her mother, even if it is just her \nremains. She is still searching, calling medical examiners around the \nstate whenever unidentified bodies are found. Even if no one is ever \ncharged, she said, she would like to bury her mother next to her \nfather. \u0014\n\u0014\nIve always had anger in the background, but now I have more empathy \nfor her, she said. I just want someone to give us back our mother.\u0014",

    "words": "Happy(?) Advent\u0014\n\u0014\nby Ted Olsen, former assistant editor of Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's pretty common to hear complaints about the difficulty of keeping \nthe joy of the Christmas season. Or, more commonly, we hear people \ntalking about how this time of year is (as Andy Williams puts it) \n\"the hap-happiest season of all.\" The world seems so festive and \ncelebratory this month that we would never dream of complaining about \nitafter all, doesn't the world take note of Jesus at this time more \nthan any?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern arguments aside, the time before Christmas hasn't always been \na celebration. Like the Lenten season before Easter, Advent was once \na solemn preparation for Christmas. Actually, not Christmas exactly. \nOriginally it was a season preparing for Epiphany, January 6which \ncommemorates not Jesus' birth, but his adoration by the Magi (in the \nWest) or his baptism in the Jordan River (in the East). Some people \nclaim Advent was first celebrated by the apostle Peter, but the exact \nstarting date of the season has been lost to history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever it started, Advent originally was a time of fasting and \nself-reflection (instead of today's Christmas parties and \"thinking \nabout other people for a change.\") In the mid-300s, two events \nchanged that thinking: Constantine the Great built the Church of the \nNativity in Bethlehem, declaring Jesus' birthday a national holiday; \nand Julius, bishop of Rome, set the date as December 25. Christmas \ntook on a happier, more celebratory feel and became a time of joyous \nanticipation. (By the mid-400s, even the Eastern churchwith a few \nexceptionsrecognized December 25 as Christmas. However, Advent is \nstill a much more solemn occasion among Orthodox Christians, and the \nseason begins much earlierNovember 15 instead of the Sunday nearest \nNovember 30.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Western church no longer required fasting during \nAdvent, though more liturgical churches still encourage solemnity and \ndiscourage festivities. For the church, purple (and blue), not red \nand green, are this season's colors. Over time, Advent also became an \noccasion to prepare for Christ's second coming as well as to reflect \non his firstwhich worked great for us at the magazine as we prepared \nan issue on the Second Coming (issue 61).\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope I don't sound like a wet blanket. We at the magazine are \n\"historically incorrect\" too, with Christmas decorations around the \noffice, carols playing softly in the background, and Christmas \nparties. But as we endeavor to \"remember the reason for the season,\" \nit's helpful for us to remember that the meaning of the season has \nchanged substantially over the centuries.\u0014",

    "words": "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing: From Wesley to Our Hymnals\u0014\nAt least four people brought the now-inviolable hymn to its current \nform.\u0014\nGordon Giles, excerpted from O Come Emmanuel: A Musical Tour of Daily \nReadings for Advent and Christmas. | posted 12/14/2007\u0014\n\u0014\n    Hark! the herald angels sing\u0014\n    Glory to the newborn King;\u0014\n    Peace on earth and mercy mild,\u0014\n    God and sinners reconciled:\u0014\n    Joyful all ye nations rise,\u0014\n    Join the triumph of the skies,\u0014\n    With the angelic host proclaim,\u0014\n    Christ is born in Bethlehem:\u0014\n    Hark! the herald angels sing\u0014\n    Glory to the newborn King.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Christ, by highest heaven adored,\u0014\n    Christ, the everlasting Lord,\u0014\n    Late in time behold him come,\u0014\n    Offspring of a virgin's womb!\u0014\n    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,\u0014\n    Hail the incarnate Deity!\u0014\n    Pleased as man with men to dwell,\u0014\n    Jesus, our Emmanuel:\u0014\n    Hark! the herald angels sing\u0014\n    Glory to the newborn King.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!\u0014\n    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!\u0014\n    Light and life to all he brings,\u0014\n    Risen with healing in his wings;\u0014\n    Mild, he lays his glory by,\u0014\n    Born that man no more may die,\u0014\n    Born to raise the sons of earth,\u0014\n    Born to give them second birth:\u0014\n    Hark! the herald angels sing\u0014\n    Glory to the newborn King.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Words: Charles Wesley (1707-88), George Whitfield (1714-70),\u0014\n\u0014\n    Martin Madan (1726-90) and William Hayman Cummings (1831-1915) \nMusic: Mendelssohn, from a chorus by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy \n(1809-47), adapted by William Hayman Cummings\u0014\n\u0014\nThe carol we now know as \"Hark! the herald angels sing\" did not start \nlife as such, and required at least four people to bring it to its \ncurrent form. Wesley's original, written as a Christmas Day hymn and \nfirst published in 1739, is made up of ten four-line verses, rather \nthan the longer eight-line verses with refrain which we have now.\u0014\nRelated articles and links\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is interesting to note that in the original version of Wesley's, \nthe heavens ring with the phrase \"Glory to the King of kings,\" \nechoing Luke's \"Glory to God in the highest heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Whitfield, who had been a student with Wesley, changed this to \n\"Glory to the newborn King\" in 1753. His fairly revolutionary \nCalvinist position was not compatible with Wesley's gentler reforming \napproach, which eventually bore fruit in the Methodist movement that \nhe and his brother John inspired, Whitfield maintained the four-line \nverses of Wesley's original, but changed the angels' emphasis: \"Glory \nto the newborn King\" means something slightly but significantly \ndifferent from \"Glory to the King of kings.\" In the Gospel account, \nthe angels praise God, whereas in \"Hark! the herald angels sing,\" \nthey are inaccurately described as praising Jesus. Furthermore, Luke \ndoes not say that the angels \"sing,\" and so it may well be that this \nreinterpretation by Whitfield has emphasized the popular but \nunscriptural picture of angels singing the Gloria. (\"While shepherds \nwatched\" also implies that they sang.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitfield also cut the final verses, which are now largely forgotten:\u0014\n\u0014\n    Come, desire of nations, come,\u0014\n    Fix in us thy humble home;\u0014\n    Rise, the woman's conquering seed,\u0014\n    Bruise in us the serpent's head.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Now display thy saving power,\u0014\n    Ruin'd nature now restore;\u0014\n    Now in mystic union join\u0014\n    Thine to ours, and ours to thine.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Adam's likeness, Lord, efface,\u0014\n    Stamp thy image in its place.\u0014\n    Second Adam from above,\u0014\n    Reinstate us in thy love.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Let us thee, though lost, regain,\u0014\n    Thee, the life, the inner man:\u0014\n    O, to all thyself impart,\u0014\n    Form'd in each believing heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some real theological insight in these neglected verses. \nFirst of all we notice the Advent antiphon \"Come, desire of nations, \ncome,\" followed by a reference to the Fall, with the serpent bruising \nthe heel of humanity and Adam bruising its head (Genesis 3:15). \nWesley cleverly alters the meaning, asking that the serpent in us \n(sin) should be bruised (defeated) by Christ, the second Adam, who \nreinstates us as beloved sons and daughters of God. In the \nrestoration of sinful humanity to a state of grace through the \nincarnation of Christ, the joining of divine and human nature is also \nachieved. Consequently, that which was lost (salvation) is gained and \na new life is granted to all believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune we now call Mendelssohn comes from the second chorus, \"Gott \nist Light\" (\"God is Light\"). While there can be no doubt that the \nmarriage of Mendelssohn's tune and the adapted words has been most \nfortuitous, it is rather ironic that Mendelssohn, while recognizing \nthe value of his tune, felt that it would be unsuitable for sacred \nwords. Similarly, Wesley, when writing the original text, suggested \nthat a slow, solemn tune would fit them best. He refused to sing \nWhitfield's reworking of his words, furious that he had presumed to \nalter them to suit his own ends. Nowadays, there would probably be an \noutcry if someone were to suggest even slight changes, and some \nattempts to \"inclusivize\" the language have been coolly received.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hark! the herald angels sing\" has become part of the institution of \nChristmas, and while it contains inaccuracies, it also sounds out \nsome wonderful theology, musically reminding us that Jesus, the \n\"newborn King,\" is \"Prince of Peace,\" \"Sun of Righteousness,\" \n\"Everlasting Lord,\" \"Incarnate Deity,\" and, best of all, \"Emmanuel\"  \n\"God with us.\" Whatever its creators would have thought about the \nhymn as it currently stands, it endures as a reminder of the great \ngift that our Father God has given us in his Son Jesus Christ, and \nwhich we will celebrate in only a few hours' time.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted from O Come Emmanuel: A Musical Tour of Daily Readings for \nAdvent and Christmas.

He \nwrote about 20 books. I think his best is his first, The Meaning of \nPersons. At Union Seminary in Richmond, VA, Helen and I heard him \ntell this story, through a translator. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis mother died when he was very young. He was raised by an aunt, who \nwas literally crazy. To survive, he walled himself off emotionally. \nThe only person with whom he ever had a personal relationship of any \nkind was his college Greek teacher. It was not an emotional \nrelationship. He would go to the mans house and have tea while they \ndid Greek. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn a ship, as a young physician, he met a Dutch financier and his \nwife, and they told him about Christ. Out of his new faith and his \nmedical practice, he wrote the manuscript for The Meaning of Persons. \nLike any author, he had no idea if it was any good, and he was afraid \nto ask. The only person he felt he could trust it to was his old \nGreek tutor. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe took it to that same parlor where he had once sipped tea and \nparsed verbs and began to read his manuscript. Each time he paused, \nhis old tutor said, Read on, Paul. Finally, exhausted, he had read \nit all. His tutor said, We must pray, Paul. Tournier was \nastonished, because his mentor had often told him that he did not \nbelieve in a personal God. Are you a Christian, too? he asked. \nYes. Since when? Tournier asked. Since now.\u0014",

    "words": "Harriet Tubman\u0014\n                                                                   \nThe \"Moses\" of Her People\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I always tole God, 'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' \nyou've got to see me through.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1831 a Kentucky slave named Tice Davids made a break for the free \nstate of Ohio by swimming across the Ohio River. His master trailed \nclose behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, \nDavids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky \nin a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids \"must have gone off \non an underground road.\" The name stuck, and the legend of the \nunderground railroad was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a \npart of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic \nexploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated \"conductor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland \nbut escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said \nlater, \"I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was \nfree. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold \nthrough de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 \nreturn trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow \nslaves, boasting \"I never lost a passenger.\" Her guidance of so many \nto freedom earned her the nickname \"Moses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of \nher strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of \nthe weak. \"I always tole God,\" she said, \"'I'm gwine [going] to hole \nstiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her \ncapture, she was never apprehended. \"I can't die but once\" became her \nmotto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of \ndeliverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually \ngoing into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to \nwhom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. \nSlaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be \nmissed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often \nbe late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them \nmissing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired \nby Tubman would take down.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded \nstrict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his \nmaster would likely be forced to reveal information that would \ncompromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a \nrescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to \nreconsider.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she \nreplied, \"Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough \nto betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let \nso many die just for one coward man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close \nwith one: \"I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. \nThey'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped \nright up and went on as well as anybody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led \nslaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading \nher. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, \"I never met any \nperson of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and \ntheir sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as \"one \nof the best and bravest persons on this continentGeneral Tubman as \nwe call her.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Tubman served as a nurse, laundress, and spy \nwith Union forces along the coast of South Carolina. After the war, \nshe made her home in Auburn, New York, and, despite numerous honors, \nspent her last years in poverty. Not until 30 years after the war was \nshe granted a government pension in recognition of her work for the \nFederal Army.\u0014",

This crisis will \nonly get worse until local, state and federal officials come together \nbehind a plan that finds short-term housing for them immediately, and \npermanent affordable housing for them quickly.\u0014\n\u0014\nCongress can start by approving a modest, $73 million in funding to \nhouse many of the regions ill and disabled residents, who would also \nbe provided with psychiatric and social services. Such a measure \npassed the Senate, but it is facing resistance in the House.\u0014\n\u0014\nCongress also needs to take at least two additional steps to prevent \neven more people from becoming homeless in New Orleans, where rents \nhave soared since the storm. It should extend the disaster housing \nassistance program, which is set to expire in March 2009, so more \npeople are not forced into the streets. It should also rewrite \nfederal disaster law to permit the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to provide the long-term assistance that thousands of \nhurricane survivors are clearly going to need.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn New Orleans, homeless services agencies estimate that the homeless \npopulation has doubled since the storm. The homeless are said to be \nsicker and more severely disabled than in the past. Outreach workers \nhave come across people suffering from severe mental disorders, as \nwell as from cancer, AIDS and end-stage kidney disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn what could be a harbinger of things to come, 30 percent of the \npeople surveyed in one homeless encampment reported that they had \nmoved onto the streets after being cut off from Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency housing assistance or while living in a household \nthat had lost the benefit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe state of Louisiana has committed itself to creating 3,000 units \nof supportive housing targeted to extremely low-income families, \nwhich includes many people with disabilities and special needs. But \nfor the units to be affordable, Congress must pass the $73 million in \nfunding to pay for rent subsidies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis would be a terrible place to economize. The dollar amount is \nsmall, and the lives of some of this countrys most vulnerable \ncitizens  who were already abandoned once by their government  are \nat stake.\u0014",

Then 31-year-old Eduard Burceag lay down on the snow and \nhis wife and a friend lay on top of him. Later, when they begged him \nto switch places, Burceag refused, saying he was OK.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In doing so, he probably saved their lives,\" park spokesman Kevin \nBacher said Thursday.\u0014\nMariana Burceag, also 31, survived the storm, as did the couple's \ngood friend, Daniel Vlad, 34. All three of the hikers were from \nRomania.\u0014\n\u0014\nKevin Hammonds, 28, who was the National Park Service ranger in \ncharge of rescue operations on duty when the call came in at 3:30 \na.m. Tuesday to the Camp Muir base camp, described the storm as the \nworst he had ever seen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHammonds and a fellow ranger, Joe Franklin, readied a search party to \ngo at first light.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt about 5:30 a.m., Franklin was checking the horizon for any clues \nto the location of the missing hikers, who all lived in a suburb of \nSeattle.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe saw what looked like a boulder in an unusual spot on the \nsnowfield, then took a closer look with binoculars and realized the \nshape was moving.\u0014\n\u0014\nHammonds grabbed two mountain guides who had stayed the night at Camp \nMuir, at the 10,000 foot level of the 14,410-foot mountain, and \nheaded out toward Vlad. Walking through knee-deep, blowing snow, it \ntook about 10 minutes to meet him halfway.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the guides helped Vlad back to Camp Muir after he directed \nHammonds and Eben Reckord of International Mountain Guides toward \nMariana and Eduard Burceag.\u0014\n\u0014\nEduard Burceag's body was brought down the mountain on a sled \nWednesday afternoon.\u0014\n\u0014\n'His children needed a lot of their mother'\u0014\n\u0014\nReached by telephone in Romania, Eduard Burceag's brother Cristian \ntold The Seattle Times that his older brother moved to America eight \nyears ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nEduard Burceag worked for Active Voice, a Seattle-based company that \nspecializes in helping companies transition from voice mail to \ncomputer communications and messaging.\u0014\n\u0014\nCristian Burceag said he was not surprised his brother died shielding \nhis wife from the blizzard.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm sure he would do that.

Or, more commonly, we hear people \ntalking about how this time of year is (as Andy Williams puts it) \n\"the hap-happiest season of all.\" The world seems so festive and \ncelebratory this month that we would never dream of complaining about \nitafter all, doesn't the world take note of Jesus at this time more \nthan any?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern arguments aside, the time before Christmas hasn't always been \na celebration. Like the Lenten season before Easter, Advent was once \na solemn preparation for Christmas. Actually, not Christmas exactly. \nOriginally it was a season preparing for Epiphany, January 6which \ncommemorates not Jesus' birth, but his adoration by the Magi (in the \nWest) or his baptism in the Jordan River (in the East). Some people \nclaim Advent was first celebrated by the apostle Peter, but the exact \nstarting date of the season has been lost to history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever it started, Advent originally was a time of fasting and \nself-reflection (instead of today's Christmas parties and \"thinking \nabout other people for a change.\") In the mid-300s, two events \nchanged that thinking: Constantine the Great built the Church of the \nNativity in Bethlehem, declaring Jesus' birthday a national holiday; \nand Julius, bishop of Rome, set the date as December 25. Christmas \ntook on a happier, more celebratory feel and became a time of joyous \nanticipation. (By the mid-400s, even the Eastern churchwith a few \nexceptionsrecognized December 25 as Christmas. However, Advent is \nstill a much more solemn occasion among Orthodox Christians, and the \nseason begins much earlierNovember 15 instead of the Sunday nearest \nNovember 30.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Western church no longer required fasting during \nAdvent, though more liturgical churches still encourage solemnity and \ndiscourage festivities. For the church, purple (and blue), not red \nand green, are this season's colors. Over time, Advent also became an \noccasion to prepare for Christ's second coming as well as to reflect \non his firstwhich worked great for us at the magazine as we prepared \nan issue on the Second Coming (issue 61).

    "title": "HISTORY OF THE CATACOMBS",
    "words": "In the first century Rome's Christians did not have their own \ncemeteries.If they owned land, they buried their relatives there, \notherwise they resorted to common cemeteries, where pagans too were \nburied. That is how Saint Peter came to be buried in the great public \n\"necropolis\" (\"city of the dead\") on Vatican Hill, available to \neverybody. Likewise Saint Paul was buried in a necropolis along the \nVia Ostiense.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first half of the second century, as a result of various \ngrants and donations, the Christians started burying their dead \nunderground. That is how the catacombs were founded. Many of them \nbegan and developed around family tombs, whose owners, newly \nconverted Christians, did not reserve them to the members of the \nfamily, but opened them to their brethren in the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the passage of time, these burial areas grew larger by gifts or \nby the purchase of new properties, sometimes on the initiative of the \nChurch itself. Typical is the case of Saint Callixtus: the Church \ntook up directly the organization and administration of the cemetery, \nassuming a community character. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the edict of Milan, promulgated by the emperors Constantine and \nLicinius in February 313, the Christians were no longer persecuted. \nThey were free to profess their faith, to have places of worship and \nto build churches both inside and outside the city, and to buy plots \nof land, without fear of confiscation. Nevertheless, the catacombs \ncontinued to function as regular cemeteries until the beginning of \nthe fifth century, when the Church retumed to bury exclusively above \nground or in the basilicas dedicated to important martyrs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the barbarians (Goths and Longobards) invaded Italy and came \ndown to Rome,they systematically destroyed a lot of monuments and \nsacked many places, including the catacombs. Powerless in the face of \nsuch repeated pillages, towards the end of the eighth century and the \nbeginning of the ninth, the Popes ordered to remove the relics of the \nmartyrs and of the saints to the city churches, for security reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the transfer of the relics was completed, the catacombs were no \nlonger visited; on the contrary, they were totally abandoned, with \nthe exception of Saint Sebastian, Saint Lawrence and of Saint \nPancratius. In the course of time, landslides and vegetation \nobstructed and hid the entrances to the other catacombs, so that the \nvery traces of their existence were lost. During the late Middle Ages \nthey didn't even know where they were. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe exploration and scientific study of the catacombs started, \ncenturies later, with Antonio Bosio (1575 - 1629), nicknamed the \n\"Columbus of subterranean Rome\". In the last century the systematic \nexploration of the catacombs, and in particular of those of Saint \nCallixtus, was carried out by Giovanni Battista de Rossi (1822 - \n1894), who is considered the father and founder of Christian \nArchaeology.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE PAST CAN GUIDE YOUR FUTURE",
    "words": "The following is excerpted from Power Ambition Glory: The Stunning \nParallels between Great Leaders of the Ancient World and Todayand \nthe Lessons You Can Learn by Steve Forbes and John Prevas (Crown \nBusiness, 2009). \u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of years ago while browsing in a local bookstore in Naples, \nFlorida, for something interesting to read, I came across Hannibal \nCrosses the Alps by John Prevas. It's the story of the ancient \nCarthaginian commander who accomplished something that neither his \nallies nor his enemies thought possible: He led an army, including \nhorses and elephants, over the Alps in winter and then defeated his \nRoman adversaries in their own backyard.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I reviewed the book in Forbes magazine, two thoughts occurred to \nme about leadership: (1) Anyone who accomplishes something great, \nsomething unique, whether in business or in politics, often does so \nby defying the conventional thinking of his time. (2) Even though \nmore than two thousand years have passed since Hannibal crossed those \nAlps, the elements of what it takes to be a successful leader have \nnot changed. They are simple and obvious, or should be: motivating \nthose who follow you to share your vision; inspiring through example; \na sense of duty and responsibility to those who trust and depend on \nyou; the capacity to see a problem and the skill to fix it; \ndeveloping and maintaining a proper perspective on yourself in the \nface of success or adversity; setting and achieving goals; \nunderstanding people's limits and knowing when to drive hard and when \nto ease up on both subordinates and competitors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ancient Greeks tell us that nothing is more important than good \nleadership for the harmonious functioning of society and nothing \nhurts more than the lack of it. Our times cry out for \nleadership--political, financial, and even ethical. Many people are \nasking today, \"Where have the good leaders gone?\" In a recent New \nYork Times column about global gridlock entitled \"Missing Dean \nAcheson,\" David Brooks posed this question, noting that Americans are \nabout to enter their nineteenth consecutive year of Truman envy. Ever \nsince the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Brooks observed, people have \nyearned for a return to a time when leaders such as Harry Truman and \nGeorge C. Marshall were able to create successful, forward-looking \nglobal institutions and policies to confront the challenges that \nfaced America at the end of the Second World War. Brooks asked, \"Why \ncan't we rally that same kind of international cooperation to solve \nour current economic crisis, confront terrorism, slow down global \nwarming, limit nuclear proliferation and a host of other pressing \nproblems today?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOurs is a complex and stressful time. We face the most serious \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s and foreign \npolicy issues that if left unsolved could bring us to the brink of \nnuclear war. Rising new powers in the world today, such as China and \nIndia, are changing traditional Western ways of conducting worldwide \npolitics and business. Old powers such as Russia and the members of \nthe relatively new European Union are seeking to advance their \ninfluence in the international community. Responses to these \ndevelopments require effective leadership. The financial crisis and \nAmerica's recent foreign policy setbacks can be traced directly to a \nfailure of leadership. But where do we turn for leadership, and what \ndo we want in our leaders? History is one place to look. The past is \nfilled with leaders who possessed extraordinary capabilities, enjoyed \ntremendous success, and directed societies that experienced problems \nsimilar to our own. Their successes and failures as leaders can help \nus develop a valuable perspective as we grapple with our problems and \ntry to prepare for the future. Similarities between those who ruled \nthe empires of the ancient world and many of today's corporate and \npolitical leaders are remarkable. Times and circumstances may change, \nbut the principles of sound leadership do not.\u0014",

    "words": "As stunning an artistic statement as Off the Wall was, it did little \nto prepare anyone for the cultural phenomenon that was his subsequent \nalbum, Thriller. Jackson's goal was to create an album in which every \nsong was a hit. He didn't quite accomplish that, but he did create a \nclassic pop album that fans zealously snatched up (to the tune of an \nestimated 100 million copies worldwide to date) and that solidified \nhis status as the King of Pop. Debate still rages about whether Off \nthe Wall or Thriller is stronger as an album. (I, for one, think it's \nthe former.) But the sea change Jackson created with Thriller had \nless to do with the music than with the medium. At the height of MTV, \nJackson became the first black artist to create a fan base using his \nimage rather than in spite of it. His grasp of performance and \npresentation remains without parallel.\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson's subsequent albums failed to reach the stratospheric heights \nof Thriller. But Jackson retained his knack for spectacle. Every \nmusic video he released was a major event, which is why MTV's \nlifetime-achievement statue at its annual awards show still bears his \nname. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a singer, as a songwriter, as a performer, as a dancer, Jackson \nremains among the most gifted, imaginative, larger-than-life musician \nof any race that has ever come along.

    "title": "HITLER'S JEWISH SOLDIERS--A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "They were foot soldiers and officers. They served in the regular army \nand the Waffen-SS. And, remarkably, they were also Jewish, at least \nas defined by Hitler's infamous race laws. Pursuing the thread he \nfirst unraveled in Hitler's Jewish Soldiers, Bryan Rigg takes a \ncloser look at the experiences of Wehrmacht soldiers who were \nclassified as Jewish. In this long-awaited companion volume, he \npresents interviews with twenty-one of these men, whose stories are \nboth fascinating and disturbing. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs many as 150,000 Jews and partial-Jews (or Mischlinge) served, \noften with distinction, in the German military during World War II. \nThe men interviewed for this volume portray a wide range of \nexperiences--some came from military families, some had been raised \nChristian--revealing in vivid detail how they fought for a government \nthat robbed them of their rights and sent their relatives to \nextermination camps. Yet most continued to serve, since resistance \nwould have cost them their lives and they mistakenly hoped that by \ntheir service they could protect themselves and their families. The \ninterviews recount the nature and extent of their dilemma, the \ndivided loyalties under which many toiled during the Nazi years and \nafterward, and their sobering reflections on religion and the \nHolocaust, including what they knew about it at the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nRigg relates each individual's experiences following the \nestablishment of Hitler's race laws, shifting between vivid scenes of \ncombat and the increasingly threatening situation on the home front \nfor these men and their family members. Their stories reveal the \nconstant tension in their lives: how some tried to hide their \nidentities, and how a few were even \"Aryanized\" as part of Hitler's \neffort to retain reliable soldiers--including Field Marshal Erhard \nMilch, three-star general Helmut Wilberg, and naval commander \nBernhard Rogge.\u0014\n\u0014\nBryan Mark Rigg, Author\u0014",

    "words": "There are a number of words in our civilian vocabulary that have a \nmilitary origin. Almost every outbreak of war spawns new words, and \nthis terminology quickly slips into everyday use. According to \nmental_floss magazine (May-June 2008), warfare is responsible for \nwords such as:\u0014\n\u0014\nUndermine. You might complain that your colleagues are undermining \nyou, and this can certainly be frustrating and damaging. But in the \n14th century, undermining was a military term for digging a secret \npassage under a building to sneak up on the enemy, or to bring down a \ncastle or some other fortification. So be glad that your coworkers \nare not undermining you  literally.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasket case. Today, a basket case is simply a deeply troubled person, \nbut during World War I it meant a living soldier who had lost all his \nlimbs and was carried home in a basket. The United States military \ndenies that real baskets were used for this purpose, but the gruesome \nimage remains.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlak. Celebrities catch a lot of flak for idiotic behavior  and they \ndeserve it. But when the word originated in the 1930s, it was short \nfor an unpronounceable 19-letter German word for anti-aircraft guns. \nThe bursting shells from these guns were a lethal threat to airplane \ncrews, and were infinitely more damaging than the words hurled at \npeople today.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the war in Iraq is contributing new vocabulary. Hillbilly armor \nis a term for the scraps used by resourceful soldiers to make their \nvehicles bulletproof. And an IED is an improvised explosive device  \na homemade bomb created by a terrorist or insurgent. A recent article \nin GQ magazine about inappropriate office-party behavior included \nthis warning, The workplace minefield is hard enough to negotiate \nwithout planting your own IEDs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you go to an office party, dont forget your hillbilly armor!\u0014",

    "title": "HARRIET TUBMAN, THE MOSES OF HER PEOPLE",
    "words": "Harriet Tubman\u0014\nThe \"Moses\" of Her People\u0014\nAugust 8, 2008\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I always tole God, 'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' \nyou've got to see me through.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1831 a Kentucky slave named Tice Davids made a break for the free \nstate of Ohio by swimming across the Ohio River. His master trailed \nclose behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, \nDavids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky \nin a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids \"must have gone off \non an underground road.\" The name stuck, and the legend of the \nunderground railroad was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a \npart of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic \nexploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated \"conductor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland \nbut escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said \nlater, \"I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was \nfree. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold \nthrough de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 \nreturn trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow \nslaves, boasting \"I never lost a passenger.\" Her guidance of so many \nto freedom earned her the nickname \"Moses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of \nher strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of \nthe weak. \"I always tole God,\" she said, \"'I'm gwine [going] to hole \nstiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'\"\u0014\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her \ncapture, she was never apprehended. \"I can't die but once\" became her \nmotto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of \ndeliverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually \ngoing into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to \nwhom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. \nSlaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be \nmissed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often \nbe late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them \nmissing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired \nby Tubman would take down.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded \nstrict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his \nmaster would likely be forced to reveal information that would \ncompromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a \nrescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to \nreconsider.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she \nreplied, \"Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough \nto betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let \nso many die just for one coward man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close \nwith one: \"I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. \nThey'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped \nright up and went on as well as anybody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led \nslaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading \nher. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, \"I never met any \nperson of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and \ntheir sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as \"one \nof the best and bravest persons on this continentGeneral Tubman as \nwe call her.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Tubman served as a nurse, laundress, and spy \nwith Union forces along the coast of South Carolina. After the war, \nshe made her home in Auburn, New York, and, despite numerous honors, \nspent her last years in poverty. Not until 30 years after the war was \nshe granted a government pension in recognition of her work for the \nFederal Army.\u0014",

    "title": "HER GOD WAS 'LIKE A TIGER' -- DOROTHY SAYERS",
    "words": "We live once again, as did early 20th-century mystery writer and lay \ntheologian Dorothy L. Sayers, in a world that could care less about \nthe doctrines of the Christian church. And once again, many of those \nwho care least are self-identified Christians and faithful \nchurchgoers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore we lose all grip on the intellectual content of our faith, \nits time to reacquaint ourselves with Sayers. In a recent Glimpses \nbulletin insert, I sketched her twin passions for swashbuckling drama \nand intellectual order, and suggested how these suited her to the \ngreat task of modern apologeticsa task probably still as urgent for \nChristian as for non-Christian audiences:\u0014\n\u0014\nDorothy L. Sayers (18931957) was a prolific scholar, novelist, \nessayist, playwright and translator. Those who know about her today \nhave usually met her through her detective stories and their \nmemorable hero, Lord Peter Wimsey. But there is much more to her \nstory. In a time of spiritual confusion, she emerged, almost despite \nherself, as an unlikely voice of clarity and a compelling lay \npreacher of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSayers, a clergymans daughter, was born into a late-Victorian \nOxford, England that had ceased to be a sleepy medieval town: \nautomobile factories now encroached on its narrow streets and \ndreamlike spires. Worse, the Christian tradition that had birthed \nOxford University was now in full retreat throughout Europe. Anyone \ntruly modern believed that humans, like everything else, are just \naggregations of atoms, and matters of morality and spirit thus mere \nillusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven the Church of England was giving in, so that by the turn of the \ncentury, bishops who doubted Christs resurrection were called \ncourageous. And though many ministers and laypeople still held on \nto Christian faith, it was increasingly a sentimentalized, moralistic \nversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn late girlhood and adolescence, Sayers was bright enough to observe \nand dislike the stuffed-shirt piety of the modernizing Church of \nEngland. She remarked that, like sex, such mysteries of the faith as \nthe sacraments and God himself seemed to be considered exceedingly \nsacred and beautiful, yet also indelicate, and only to be mentioned \nin whispers. As she would later say about this sort of overdone \nchurchiness: At the name of Jesus, every voice goes plummy.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was saved from outright rebellion against her fathers faith by \nreading the Roman Catholic journalist-apologist G. K. \nChestertonespecially his Orthodoxy. It was stimulating to be told, \nshe wrote, that Christianity was not a dull thing but a gay thing; \nnot a stick-in-the-mud thing but an adventurous thing; not an \nunintelligent thing but a wise thing, indeed a shrewd thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPressing in to find the truth, she discovered a God who is a fact, a \nthing like a tiger, a reason for changing ones conduct. A fan of \nDumass The Three Musketeers, she had swooped about her girlhood home \nin the costume of DArtagnan. Now she began to see just how dramatic \nand compelling is the gospel story.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter an Oxford education in medieval languages (she was in the first \nclass of women to receive their B.A. and M.A.), Sayers worked first \nas a copy editor, then an advertising writer. Then she began writing \na well-crafted series of mystery novels featuring the aristocratic \ndetective Lord Peter Wimsey.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 1930s and the 1940s, however, her life changed direction \nwhen she was invited to write a series of plays for performance in \nthe Canterbury Cathedral. Here was an opportunity to reconnect with \nall the drama and pageantry she had loved as a girl in The Three \nMusketeers. Her plays made Christian themes vivid and launched her \ninto a new career as a lay theologian, as newspapers and institutions \nbegan clamoring for her thoughts on the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe threw herself into that role in a way that was both swashbuckling \nand intellectually rigorous. During the season of Lent in 1938, \nSayers wrote an article for the London Times in Chestertonian mode: \nOfficial Christianity . . . has been having what is known as a bad \npress. We are constantly assured that the churches are empty because \npreachers insist too much upon doctrine. . . . The fact is the \nprecise opposite. . . . The Christian faith is the most exciting \ndrama that ever staggered the imagination of man . . . and the dogma \nis the drama. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe followed with What Do We Believe? The Other Six Deadly Sins, \nThe Triumph of Easter, and many other essays. She wanted to awaken \na sleeping church and insist that it reclaim the doctrines of the \nhistoric creedspowerful realities that had been lost under layer \nupon layer of well-meaning but stuffy clergy jargon. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1940, as her reputation as a public apologist grew, she was asked \nby the BBC to write a serialized play on the life of Jesus. At the \ntime (and up until 1968), it was illegal in England to portray Jesus \non stage, and it required a special church dispensation even to allow \nthis radio play. She wrote, I feel very strongly that the \nprohibition against representing Our Lord directly on the stage or in \nfilms . . . tends to produce a sense of unreality which is very \ndamaging to the ordinary mans conception of Christianity. . . . \nBible characters are felt to be quite different from ordinary human \nbeings. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer way of breaking through this sense of unreality was to write a \nnew translation from the Greek that avoided the churchy verbiage of \nthe good old Authorized Version (KJV). She directed her actors to \nspeak with accents appropriate to the working-class status of the \ndisciples. When the public heard The Man Born to Be King, rapturous \nletters poured in from listeners of all ages. People were grateful \nthat Sayers had presented the story of Jesus in a realer and more \npowerful way than they had ever heard. C. S. Lewis was among those \nwho loved the play: for the rest of his life, he read it each year \nduring Holy Week.\u0014\n\u0014\nSayerss final and arguably greatest work began when she was 51, \nhuddled in a bomb shelter, reading her grandmothers copy of Dantes \nInferno. For the rest of her life, she labored to make Dantes epic \npoem of Christian theology, spirituality, and morality live again for \na new generation. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn December 17, 1957, Dorothy L. Sayers died of heart failure. She \nwas sixty-four years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nBishops, dignitaries and many friends attended the memorial service. \nThere, a eulogy by C. S. Lewis was read and leather-bound copies of \nher essay The Greatest Drama Ever Staged were handed out to all. \nThen as now, Dorothy L. Sayers was recognized as one of Englands \nmost remarkable voices for the truth of faith.\u0014",

    "words": "(born c. 1820, Dorchester county, Maryland, U.S.died March 10, 1913, \nAuburn, New York) American bondwoman who escaped from slavery in the \nSouth to become a leading abolitionist before the American Civil War. \nShe led hundreds of bondsmen to freedom in the North along the route \nof the Underground Railroadan elaborate secret network of safe \nhouses organized for that purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn a slave, Araminta Ross later adopted her mother's first name, \nHarriet. From early childhood she worked variously as a maid, a \nnurse, a field hand, a cook, and a woodcutter. About 1844 she married \nJohn Tubman, a free black.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1849, on the strength of rumours that she was about to be sold, \nTubman fled to Philadelphia. In December 1850 she made her way to \nBaltimore, Maryland, whence she led her sister and two children to \nfreedom. That journey was the first of some 19 increasingly dangerous \nforays into Maryland in which, over the next decade, she conducted \nupward of 300 fugitive slaves along the Underground Railroad to \nCanada. By her extraordinary courage, ingenuity, persistence, and \niron discipline, which she enforced upon her charges, Tubman became \nthe railroad's most famous conductor and was known as the Moses of \nher people. Rewards offered by slaveholders for her capture \neventually totaled $40,000. Abolitionists, however, celebrated her \ncourage. John Brown, who consulted her about his own plans, referred \nto her as General Tubman. About 1858 she bought a small farm near \nAuburn, New York, where she placed her aged parents (she had brought \nthem out of Maryland in June 1857) and herself lived thereafter. From \n1862 to 1865 she served as a scout and spy, as well as nurse and \nlaundress, for Union forces in South Carolina.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Civil War Tubman settled in Auburn and began taking in \norphans and the elderly, a practice that eventuated in the Harriet \nTubman Home for Indigent Aged Negroes. The home later attracted the \nsupport of former abolitionist comrades and of the citizens of \nAuburn, and it continued in existence for some years after her death. \nIn the late 1860s and again in the late 1890s she applied for a \nfederal pension for her Civil War services. Some 30 years after her \nservice a private bill providing for $20 monthly was passed by \nCongress.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1994-2009 Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet Tubman's Life in Slavery\u0014\nHarriet Ross was born into slavery in 1819 or 1820, in Dorchester \nCounty, Maryland. Given the names of her two parents, both held in \nslavery, she was of purely African ancestry. She was raised under \nharsh conditions, and subjected to whippings even as a small child. \nAt the age of 12 she was seriously injured by a blow to the head, \ninflicted by a white overseer for refusing to assist in tying up a \nman who had attempted escape. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of 25, she married John Tubman, a free African American. \nFive years later, fearing she would be sold South, she made her \nescape. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer Escape to Freedom in Canada\u0014\nTubman was given a piece of paper by a white neighbor with two names, \nand told how to find the first house on her path to freedom. At the \nfirst house she was put into a wagon, covered with a sack, and driven \nto her next destination. Following the route to Pennsylvania, she \ninitially settled in Philadelphia, where she met William Still, the \nPhiladelphia Stationmaster on the Underground Railroad. With the \nassistance of Still, and other members of the Philadelphia \nAnti-Slavery Society, she learned about the workings of the UGRR. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1851 she began relocating members of her family to St. Catharines, \n(Ontario) Canada West. North Street in St. Catharines remained her \nbase of operations until 1857.

    "words": "I've decided that the best place to begin our study is by \nsummarizing\u0014\n         for you the life of a remarkable man who lived nearly 2,000 \nyears ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n        A. The accounts of his life may sound familiar to you.\u0014\n           1. Before he was born, his mother knew he would not be a\u0014\n              normal child. An angelic visitor told her that her son \nwould be\u0014\n              divine.\u0014\n           2. His birth was accompanied by miraculous signs and \nwonders\u0014\n              and as a child, he was religiously precocious.\u0014\n           3. As an adult, he left home to engage in an itinerant \npreaching\u0014\n              ministry, teaching his good news that people should \nlive for\u0014\n              what is spiritual, not the material things of this \nworld.\u0014\n           4. He gathered disciples and did miracles to confirm them \nin\u0014\n              their faith.\u0014\n           5. He raised the ire of many of those in power, who had him\u0014\n              brought up on charges before the Roman authorities.\u0014\n           6. Even after he left this world, though, his followers \nclaimed\u0014\n              that he had ascended to heaven and that they had seen \nhim\u0014\n              alive afterwards. They wrote books about his life, and \nsome of\u0014\n              these writings still survive today.\u0014\n           7. I doubt if any of you has ever read them, and I doubt \nif many\u0014\n              of you have even heard the name of the man Ive been\u0014\n              describing: Apollonius of Tyana. He was a famous neo-\u0014\n              Pythagorean philosopher of the first century AD, a \nworshiper\u0014\n              of pagan gods, whose life and teachings are recorded \nfor us in\u0014\n              the writings of his later follower Philostratus, The \nLife of\u0014\n              Apollonius of Tyana.\u0014\n        B. Apollonius lived at about the same time as Jesus, although \nthey\u0014\n           never knew each other. Their followers, though, knew each \nother\u0014\n           and had heated debates about who was superior.\u0014\n        C. These were not the only two men believed to be divine. \nJesus may\u0014\n           be the only miracle-working Son of God that we know about \nin\u0014\n           our world, but he was not at all the only one talked about \nin his\u0014\n           world.\u0014\n         \u0014\nBart Ehrman, \"The Historical Jesus\"\u0014",

He scratched the earth for worms and insects. \nHe looked for the corn that the man would throw into the yard. He \nclucked and cackled as best as he could, and as he grew, he would, \nlike the other chickens, thrash his wings and fly a few feet in the \nair.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears passed in this way, and the eagle grew very old. One day he saw \na magnificent bird far above him in the cloudless sky. It glided \nmajestically among the powerful wind currents, soaring and swooping, \nscarcely beating its long golden wings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe old eagle looked at it in awe and asked, What is that?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the eagle, the king of the birds, said one of his \nneighbors. He belongs to the sky and to the high places. We belong \nto the earth, we are chickens.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe old eagle knew this was true, and so it was he lived and died as \na chicken, for that is what he believed he was.\u0014",

    "title": "HE CHOSE TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MANKIND",
    "words": "He reached his sociology class that met at the University Chapel, a \nspace that could accommodate the over 800 students that gathered \ntwice a week. This was a lousy learning environment, made even worse \nby a lack of sleep and a professor whose lecture might as well have \nbeen read from the assigned textbook. After class he walked down the \ndog steps and into the foyer of the dormitory, pushed the up button \nfor the elevator, stepped inside, pushed 20, and ascended to the top \nfloor. Throwing his books on his desk, he pulled the curtains shut \nand climbed back into bed. He fell asleep within a few minutes and \nhad a dream that changed his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dream was simple... he was given an image of himself as God saw \nhim -- an image that was very different than the one he had formed of \nhimself. The dream offered him a vision of his life first as a young \nman, then as an old man. He was dressed in light, able to give and \nreceive love, and he knew that he was glimpsing his truest self. Upon \nawakening he discovered that his mind had been branded by the \npowerful image that he knew was impressed upon him by God Almighty. \nFrom that moment on he began to seek God's light.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen our lives are touched by the reality of the Holy, we continue to \nhave choices -- yet our choices become narrower and at times more \nobvious. It seems that our choices are really quite simple: we either \nchoose to obey God or we are miserable. The young man in this story \nwould soon discover that he had to make a choice whether to follow \nthe prompting of the Holy Spirit or to follow the wishes of his \nparents. He announced to his parents that he was leaving college to \npursue a spiritual journey. His parents thought he was crazy and \nexpressed their concerns in no uncertain terms; they didn't \nunderstand or support his decision to leave college. He needed to \ndiscover more about the power of God, while his parents understood \nthat he needed an education to be successful in the world. But the \nSpirit was calling him to a different knowledge: \"We must obey God \nrather than any human authority.\" He left his college, returning \nlater to complete his education after experiencing a journey that \ntaught him about faith and holiness. That journey is another story \ntoo long to tell here.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later he found himself at a divinity school, preparing to serve \nas a minister, when the Spirit again called him to leave the seminary \nenvironment, and also to sell everything that he had and give it to \nthe poor. This time his mother nearly had a heart attack at the \nthought of him giving away the inheritance that he had received from \nher father, his grandfather. \"We must obey God rather than any human \nauthority.\" He did leave the seminary, and he did sell everything he \nhad and gave it to the poor -- and to his surprise he was invited to \nlive in a monastic community where he experienced daily worship, \ncontemplative prayer, and the deep healing power of our Lord Jesus \nChrist. His journey continues to this day. As he listens for the wind \nof the Spirit and the call of Jesus, he continues to find himself in \nunexpected adventures with the choice of obedience to God always \nbefore him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we look at our lives, we may ask: What risk is the Spirit calling \nus to take? As we think of what God is doing in our faith \ncommunities, in our families, and in our personal lives, it may be \ngood for us to ask ourselves if our faith communities, our families, \nand our personal lives show obedience to God rather than to human \nauthorities, or even worse, to self-centered and sinful desires. A \ntrue journey of faith will likely take us to places that we never \ndreamed we would go, and yet we can be sure that we will be blessed \nand God will be honored if we choose to obey our Lord's will and live \nout His vision for each of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can imagine those first apostles filled with the Spirit of God, \nfilled with confidence and courage, filled with the desire to share \nthe good news of the life-giving power over sin and death that they \nfound in connecting their lives with the living God through the \nperson of Jesus Christ. May our choices reflect the same obedience to \nGod, and may our lives show forth His presence in our communities, in \nour families, and in ourselves. Let us obey God rather than any other \nhuman authority!\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn S. Smylie is the rector of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in \nCasper, Wyoming.

As the days passed, he recovered strength. \nOne morning the doctor told him how fortunate he was.

Instead, they did nothing to halt the \nslaughter. A horde of howling camp-followers raged through the city, \nkilling everyone they found. They entered the churches, where the \ntown's folk huddled in terror, and butchered them in cold blood, \nalthough some of the victims undoubtedly hoped for divine \nintervention as they held up relics and crucifixes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope's representative seemed untroubled by the massacre when he \nwrote to his master, Innocent III, that \"neither age, nor sex, nor \nstatus had been spared.\" In fact, a popular account said that \nArnald-Amaury, the pope's legate, was asked at the height of the \nbutchery how the killers should distinguish Catholic from heretic. He \nwas said to have replied.\"Kill them all; God will recognize his own.\" \nAlthough this cannot be verified, it indicates how contemporaries \nfelt about the event.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeziers is a city in Southern France, near the Mediterranean, across \nfrom Italy. We associate crusades with the Middle East. So how come a \ncrusade was taking place there?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe region of southern and western France was infected with movements \nwhich opposed Catholicism. Especially strong in that area were the \nCathars, also known as Albigenses (because they were strongest around \nAlbi). According to Catholic sources, the Cathars had corrupted \nChristian teachings with many false doctrines. (Virtually all Cathar \nliterature was destroyed so we know little about what they really \ntaught.) However, Cathar elders lived holy lives, and in an age in \nwhich the church was rich, top-heavy, and corrupt, the simple, pure \nCathars attracted many followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1the \npope offered wicked men pardon for their sins if they would undertake \na crusade against the heretics. The prospect of loot excited many to \njoin the army. The crusaders swept down upon Beziers, arriving July \n21, 1209. The city was well-provisioned for a fight. Catholic and \nheretic alike joined to defend it against the crusaders. That Beziers \ndid not give the invaders a real fight was owing to a mistake. On \nthis day, July 22, 1209, a group of defenders rode out with white \npennants shooting arrows at the crusaders. They killed one. Furious, \na bunch of rag-tag camp followers, without proper weapons, rushed the \nwalls. Beziers had not expected an attack so soon; the walls were not \nproperly manned. Defenders fled. Within three hours, the crusaders \nhad taken a city that they had thought they would have to beseige for \nseveral months.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe knights and bishops did nothing to stop the killing. But when the \npoor soldiers began to loot, the knights stepped in. The plunder was \nfor them. They found it easy enough to stop their followers then. But \nsome of the looters, angry at being cheated out of their share of the \nspoils, set buildings on fire. Soon much of the town was ablaze, and \nwithin a few hours the crusaders had to pull out, the heat was so \nintense.

Hours later, Dr. Hauser, a rising star for his \nexplorations into cognition and morality, made his first public \nstatement since news of the inquiry emerged last week, telling The \nNew York Times, I acknowledge that I made some significant mistakes \nand saying he was deeply sorry for the problems this case had caused \nto my students, my colleagues and my university. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Hauser is a leader in the field of animal and human cognition, \nand in 2006 wrote a well-received book, Moral Minds: How Nature \nDesigned Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong. Harvard's findings \nagainst him, if sustained, may cast a shadow over the broad field of \nscientific research that depended on the particular research \ntechnique often used in his experiments. \u0014\n\u0014\nHarvard itself had faced growing criticism for not releasing more \ndetails of the inquiry since \\The Boston Globe reported on Aug. 10 \nthat the university had found evidence of scientific misconduct in \nDr. Hauser's lab. On Friday, Michael D. Smith, dean of the Harvard \nfaculty of arts and sciences, \\issued a letter to the faculty \nconfirming the inquiry and saying the eight instances of scientific \nmisconduct involved problems of data acquisition, data analysis, \ndata retention, and the reporting of research methodologies and \nresults. No further details were given. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe dean's letter said that the United States attorney's office for \nthe District of Massachusetts had begun an inquiry and that Harvard \nwas cooperating.

God was initially wrapped not in swaddling clothes but \nin birth matter. He had blood coursing through his veins, fecal \nmatter through his intestines, and urine through his urinary tract. \nGod chewed and swallowed food, and sometimes vomited from drinking \nbad water or eating contaminated food. God sweated; he had body odor. \nHe had dirt caked around his toes and ankles, splinters under his \nskin, and scabs from cutting himself in the carpentry shop. His hair \nwas probably greasy and matted. He had pimples in his youth. He had \nwax in his ears. He had sexual thoughts, albeit without lusting. He \nhad a penis and hair in his armpits. His frail human body gave out on \nhim every night. At that point in the day, he had to put acts of love \non hold; he was just too tired to keep going.\u0014\n\u0014\nAh, yes: He also died. His heart stopped beating. His brain waves \nceased to function. His body started to decomposeand smell.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo shocking is this reality that we're quick to clothe it with \nrespectability. We wrap the baby Jesus in a clean blanket and stick \nhim in a bed of fresh straw. Or we paint him as a well-manicured, \nmetrosexual Middle Easterner knocking on a charming 19th-century \ncottage door.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly on, though, many people saw the Incarnation (and all it \nentailed, especially the crucifixion) as foolishness. Or a scandal. \nOr blasphemy. Some early Christians, called \"docetists,\" couldn't \nswallow it, and posited a Jesus who only seemed human. Gnostics like \nValentinus taught that \"Christ\" came upon \"Jesus\" only at his \nbaptism, and then departed from \"Jesus\" before the crucifixioncan't \nhave \"Christ\" trafficking in birth matter and blood.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nervousness about Jesus' humanity is not new, then, but it's hard \nto understand why we have become more scandalized by Jesus wearing \nsunglasses or throwing dishes than by God living in and as a human \nbody. And yet: Hasn't the transcendent and holy God \"demeaned\" \nhimself in taking on human flesh and consorting with sinners? In our \nwildest imagination, what greater insult to pure divinity could we \nfabricate?\u0014",

    "words": "Jimmy Buffett was born in Mississippi, but raised in Alabama. Living \nhis youth along the coastal waterway permeated his very being. The \nsea and the shore gave him his identity and calling in life. He \nwanted to share a life lived in the salt air with everyone. Thus, \nBuffett and his Coral Reefer Band became known for their laid-back \ntunes like \"Margaritaville\" and \"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\" His \nlifestyle, his singing, the lyrics of his songs has made Buffett a \nhousehold name. That familiarity and easy-going manner has made him a \nsource of comfort, even if it is no more than listening to a CD on \nthe car stereo.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Buffett understood the \nfrustration and anger of the Gulf residents and business owners. He \nalso realized their sense of helplessness and hopelessness as wave \nafter wave brings more oil upon the white pristine sands of Alabama. \nAccepting that this would be the way of life for a time to come, \nBuffett asked himself, \"Now, what you do with that is a big question.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of this unfortunate man-made tragedy, Buffett realized \nhe did have a real and significant role to play. He knew he was an \nentertainer. He realized that he had countless fans who found his \nmusic relaxing, a reprieve from the daily grind of life. So he \ndecided that he and his band would perform a series of free concerts \non the beach at Gulf Shores, Alabama. Buffett's expectation was \nsimple, \"What I'm best at is two hours of escapism for people.\" With \na beach concert open to the public, for a short time anyway, he could \ncreate, in his own words, a \"Mardi Gras mentality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe find comfort in the familiar. It is by hearing often-repeated \ntunes, phrases, and quotes that we understand an author's message and \nput a framework around new material. The apostle Paul understood this \nas he employed the familiar in many of his writings, two of which are \nshowcased in our lectionary reading for this Sunday. It is important \nto focus on Paul's message that \"God's word is not chained.\" We are \nto be challenged that \"a workman who does not need to be ashamed who \ncorrectly handles the word of truth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Paul, these challenges were encased in the familiar that \nfacilitated a listener's understanding. He opened by quoting a creed, \n\"Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David.\" And \nclosed with a hymn sung in worship, \"Here is a trustworthy saying: If \nwe died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will \nalso reign with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn our desire to share the gospel message, let us be sure to use \nlanguage that people find comforting, familiar, and are able to \neasily relate to.\u0014",

    "title": "HEIRS TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD",
    "words": "Daniel 7:1-3, 15-18\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Book of Daniel was written between the time of the desecration of \nthe Jerusalem Temple by the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes in \n167 B.C. and the death of Antiochus in 164 B.C. The years between \nthese two dates were times of testing, persecution, and war. \nAntiochus' act, \"the abomination of the desolation,\" led to such an \nuprising among the Jewish people that the Maccabean War was the \nresult. The Book of Daniel was written in these precarious times in \norder to give hope to those who were despaired and those who were \ntempted to give up the faith in order to ride the tide of Antiochus' \nattempt to universalize his own pagan religion. The first half of the \nbook consists mostly of stories that demonstrate the rewards given to \nthose who are faithful. The second half conveys the vision and dreams \nthat offer hope in terms and images of an apocalyptic bent. Our \nlesson opens the second part of the book, and on so doing begins to \nprovide an answer to the reason the dead are grateful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Book of Daniel is unusual in that portions of the book are \nwritten in Hebrew and other portions are written in Aramaic. (The \nvision in this pericope was written in Aramaic.) The book also \ncarries a certain strange air about it (strange for modern readers at \nany rate) because of its apocalyptic nature. As apocalypse the book \n\"unveils\" the secrets about the end time and about when it will occur.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn verse 1 we find mention of Belshazzar, the son of, and apparently \ncoregent with, Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon who ruled from 555 \nto 539 B.C. The Neo-Bablyonian Empire ended at that point, for Cyrus \nthe Great, King of Persia, conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. Cyrus' \nsuccessors ruled the Near East for about 200 years. The historical \nallusion here, as is true throughout the book, thus sets the story of \nDaniel in the sixth century B.C., even though its composition \noccurred in the second century B.C. as a series of sermons for the \npeople of that later time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same verse we read that the dream is written down, a \ncharacteristic that illustrates a difference between apocalyptic and \nprophecy: in apocalyptic, work is written down where prophetic \nmaterial is usually spoken. Because apocalyptic developed in menacing \ntimes, usually times of persecution, the written message provided \nmore safety than oral delivery, especially when the story line \nfocused on characters and evens that occurred 400 years earlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile both apocalyptic and prophetic proclamations use vision as a \nmajor source of inspiration, the visions of apocalyptic tend to be \nmore bizarre. Here Daniel reports a nocturnal vision about four \nbeasts that arise from the sea. While our pericope jumps from this \npoint in verse 3 to the interpretation of the dream in verses 15-18, \nthe four beastly figures appear to represent four succeeding empires: \nthe Neo-Babylonian, the Median, the Persian, and the Greek -- all of \nwhich shall pass away before the Ancient of Days on the throne grants \nthe kingdom to the \"one like a human being\" who comes before him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a sense, the elimination of verses 4-14 avoids the problem of \nidentifying the \"one like a human being.\" In the context of the \nvision this image, like the other figures -- the beasts -- seems to \nrepresent a community, for in the interpretation of the dream at \nverse 18 the kingdom is given to \"the holy ones of the Most High.\" \nLater in the chapter, the recipients of the kingdom are described as \n\"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" (v. 27). These people \nwould appear to be those who have lost their lives, that is, the \nMaccabean martyrs, in the war against the Seleucids.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe interpretation offered to Daniel in verses 15-18 provides for us \ninterpreters today a significant lesson. While we might conjecture \nall kinds of possibilities to answer such questions as the identity \nof the beasts, the identity of the \"one like a human being\" (or \"like \na son of man\"), or the identity of the \"little horn\" on the fourth \nbeast, the Bible will often interpret itself if only we read another \nparagraph or two further.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this case, the interpretation answers the questions about why the \ndead can be grateful. Those who have died in faith are the heirs of \nthe kingdom of God.\u0014",

For example, he wrote in his journal, \"I went up to town and \nreceived the Holy Orders of a Priest; may I be a temple of chastity \nand holiness, fit and clean to receive so great a guest; and, on so \ngreat a commission as I have now received, O my beloved Redeemer, my \ndear Brother and Master, hear my prayer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the person in the pew, Henry Alford is best known as the author of \nthe Thanksgiving hymn \"Come Ye Thankful People Come.\" Among scholars, \nhe is better known for his commentary on the Greek New Testament, on \nwhich he labored for eighteen years. He did much of this work while \ncarrying on the duties of a vicar to the small parish of Wymeswold. \nIt had been neglected and he rebuilt it, visiting every soul in his \nkeeping. One of his major undertakings was a series of Sunday \nafternoon sermons in which he taught through books of the Bible, \nexplaining their meaning. He had a knack for explaining things in a \nway the simple people could understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, explaining that Paul expected Christ to return in his \nown lifetime, he wrote, \"Nor need it surprise any Christian that the \napostles should in this matter of detail have found their personal \nexpectation liable to disappointment respecting a day of which it is \nso solemnly said that no man knoweth its appointed time, not the \nangels in heaven, not the Son, but the Father only (Mark xiii. 32).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter many years of hard work, chiefly at Wymeswold, he accepted a \nposition at Canterbury Cathedral that allowed him more time to write. \nAt Canterbury, he began a series of Sunday afternoon services as he \nhad done at Wymeswold. Again these attracted large crowds. His \npreaching was evangelical. Formal church leaders considered him a bit \nradical but his good humor and friendliness won their affection. He \nwas notable for being able to see the best points in all Christian \npositions, however much he might disagree with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry died rather unexpectedly in 1871. In addition to Bible work and \nhymns, he edited the poems of John Donne and translated Homer's \nOdyssey.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAlford, Henry.

    "title": "HE CAME TO SHOW THE WAY",
    "words": "When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by \nhis disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or \nare we to wait for another?\" Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John \nwhat you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, \nthe lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the \npoor have good news brought to them.\" (vv. 2--5)\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was once a man who didn't believe in God, and he was quick to \nlet others know his opinion. However, his wife was a Christian who \nraised their children with her beliefs. She encouraged them to ignore \ntheir father's critical comments.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne snowy Christmas Eve as his wife was leaving their farm to take \ntheir children to a Christmas Eve service, she asked him to come. He \nrefused, saying, \"Christmas is nonsense! What kind of God comes to \nearth as a man? What unrealistic humility. It's ridiculous!\" So she \nand the children left, and he stayed home.\u0014\n\u0014\nA little while later, the howling winds called him to look outside. \nThe gentle snow was turning into a blizzard. The thickness of the \nsnow made it hard to see. He returned to his chair to relax by the \ncrackling fire. Then he heard a loud thump. Something had hit the \nwindow. Then another thump. He looked out the window, but couldn't \nsee anything in the blinding snow. So he put on his heavy coat and \nventured outside to see what was making the noise.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral yards from his house he saw a flock of wild geese flapping \nand aimlessly confused. Apparently they had been flying south for the \nwinter when they got caught in the snowstorm. They were stranded on \nhis farm looking for food and shelter. Evidently, a couple of them \nhad been attracted to the light from his window.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man felt sorry for the geese and wanted to help them. The barn \nwould be a great place for them. It was warm and safe. Surely they \nwould be able to continue their journey the next day. So he walked \nover to the barn and opened the doors wide. He hoped the geese would \nnotice the open barn and go inside. He waited, but the geese just \nfluttered around aimlessly. They didn't even seem to notice the barn \nlet alone realize the safety available.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen the man tried to shoo them into the barn, but that just seemed \nto scare them, and they moved further away. He went into the house \nand returned with breadcrumbs to make a trail leading to the barn. \nThey still didn't catch on. He was getting frustrated as all his \nattempts to help were failing. Nothing he did could get them to go \ninto the barn where they would be warm and safe.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe exclaimed, \"Why don't they follow me? Can't they see this is the \nonly place where they can survive the storm?\" He deliberated for a \nmoment and realized that these wild geese would never follow a human. \nHe thought to himself, \"If only I were a goose, then I could save \nthem.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he had an idea. He went into the barn, got one of his own geese, \nand carried it in his arms as he circled around behind the flock of \nwild geese. He then released it. His goose flew through the flock and \nstraight into the barn and one by one the other geese followed it to \nsafety.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe stood silently for a moment as the words he had spoken a few \nminutes earlier replayed in his mind: \"If only I were a goose, then I \ncould save them!\" Then he thought about what he had said to his wife \nearlier. \"Why would God want to be like us? That's ridiculous!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly it all made sense. That is what God had done. We were like \nthe geese - blind, lost, and perishing. God became human to show us \nthe way to salvation. The man realized the meaning of Christmas. He \nstood in the midst of the storm with an unusual peace. He knew why \nJesus was born. He fell to his knees in the snow, and prayed his \nfirst prayer: \"Thank you, God, for coming in human form to get me out \nof the storm!\"\u0014",

    "words": "HOW DID OUR CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS \nHAPPEN?      \u0014\n\u0014\n         Christmas is a holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus in \na humble manger more than\u0014\n         2,000 years ago. Festivities often combine the commemoration \nof Jesus' birth with\u0014\n         various secular customs, many of which have been influenced \nby earlier\u0014\n         winter festivals. The date as a birth date for Jesus is \ntraditional, and is not\u0014\n         considered to be his actual date of birth.\u0014\n\u0014\n           In most places around the world, Christmas Day is \ncelebrated Dec. 25.\u0014\n         Christmas Eve is Dec. 24. In Great Britain and many \nCommonwealth coun-\u0014\n         tries, Boxing Day, when small gifts are given, is the \nfollowing day, Dec. 26.\u0014\n         In many predominantly Catholic countries, St. Stephen's Day \nor the Feast of St.\u0014\n         Stephen is celebrated Dec. 26.\u0014\n\u0014\n           The Armenian Apostolic Church observes Christmas Jan. 6. \nEastern Orthodox\u0014\n         churches that still use the Julian Calendar celebrate \nChristmas on the Julian version\u0014\n         of Dec. 25, which is Jan. 7 on the more widely used \nGregorian calendar, because\u0014\n         the two calendars are now 13 days apart.  (Armenians who use \nthe Julian Calendar\u0014\n         celebrate Christmas on the Julian version of Jan. 6, which \nis Jan. 19 on the Gregorian\u0014\n         calendar.)\u0014\n\u0014\n           The word Christmas is a contraction of two words \nChrist's mass and is derived\u0014\n         from the Middle English Christemasse and Old English Cristes \nmasse, a phrase first\u0014\n         recorded in 1038.\u0014\n\u0014\n           In early Greek versions of the New Testament, the letter \nchi is the first let-\u0014\n         ter of Christ. Since the mid- 16th century, the similar \nRoman letter X was used as\u0014\n         an abbreviation for Christ. Thus, Xmas  is sometimes used \nas an abbreviation for\u0014\n         Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n           After the conversion to Christianity of Anglo-Saxons in \nEngland from their in-\u0014\n         digenous Anglo-Saxon polytheism (a form of Germanic paganism \nin the very early\u0014\n         seventh century), Christmas was called geol, which was the \nname of the native\u0014\n         Germanic pre-Christian solstice festival that fell on that \ndate. From geol, the current\u0014\n         English word Yule is derived.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Many customs associated with modern Christmas were derived \nfrom Germanic\u0014\n         paganism.\u0014\n\u0014\n           The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after \nCharlemagne was\u0014\n         crowned on Christmas Day in 800.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Around the 12th century, the remnants of the former \nSaturnalian tradi-\u0014\n         tions of the Romans were transferred to the Twelve Days of \nChristmas (Dec.\u0014\n         26-Jan. 6). Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public \nfestival,\u0014\n         incorporating ivy, holly, and other evergreens, as well as \ngift-giving.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Modern traditions have come to include the display of \nNativity scenes,\u0014\n         holly and Christmas trees, the exchange of cards and gifts \nand the ar-\u0014\n         rival of Santa Claus, or Father Christmas as he is still \ncalled in some parts of the world,\u0014\n         on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Popular Christmas themes include the promotion of peace \nand goodwill to all.\u0014",

    "words": "Happy Marriage Can Ease Arthritis Pain\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Catherine Donaldson-Evans \u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage has been touted as a cure for all kinds of ills. Now it's \neven being hailed as a painkiller for people suffering from arthritis.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew research shows that happily married people with rheumatoid \narthritis experience milder pain in their joints and better mobility \nthan those who are single or in bad marriages.\u0014\n\u0014\nScientists and psychologists have long pointed to happiness, \nemotional well-being and satisfying relationships as natural pain \nrelievers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just as you can turn up the volume on an amplifier to increase \nsound, emotions turn up the volume on pain,\" said AOL Health's mental \nhealth expert \\Dr. Daniel Carlat, a Massachusetts psychiatrist who \nspecializes in depression. \"That finding is basically saying that \nwhen you're happy, you have less pain. Pain has a huge psychological \ncomponent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCarlat says he sees the phenomenon in his own practice when treating \nseverely depressed patients.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oftentimes, people with clinical depression have pain as a symptom,\" \nhe told AOL Health. \"Typically when that person gets better with \nmedication or therapy, not only do they get better emotionally but \nthey get somewhat better physically.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe latest findings, published in The Journal of Pain, confirm \nprevious research showing that arthritis seems to advance more slowly \nin married people than it does in single people, \\according to the \nU.K.'s Daily Mail.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the new study suggests that the nature of the marriage is just as \nimportant in how the disease progresses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These findings suggest the links between being married and health \ndepend on the quality of the marriage, not simply whether or not \nsomeone is married,\" lead author Dr. Jennifer Barsky Reese of Johns \nHopkins University, told the Daily Mail. \"There is something about \nbeing in a high-quality marriage that seems to buffer a patient's \nemotional health.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBarsky Reese and her colleagues studied 255 people with rheumatoid \narthritis, questioning them on whether they were happily married or \nhad had rifts over finances,\u0014\nin-laws and other common relationship stressors. They were also asked \nabout their level of pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nForty-four of those quizzed said they were having marital problems, \nand 114 said their marriages were strong. The other participants were \nsingle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose in good marriages scored lower on the pain scale, even if they \nwere at more advanced stages of the disease than their unhappily \nmarried or single counterparts, according to the Mail.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Science shows that the more social support you have, the less likely \nyou are to experience negative stresses which can add to pain,\" \npsychology expert Cary Cooper, a professor at the University of \nLancaster in the U.K., told the paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nRheumatoid arthritis usually afflicts older people and is caused by \nan attack of the immune system on the joints. Sufferers have joint \npain, swelling and stiffness that can be crippling in the most \nserious cases.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA 2009 World Health Organization study found that marriage was linked \nto a lower risk of developing anxiety and depression. Other research \nhas found that insecurity in relationships can contribute to a host \nof health problems, married people live longer than single people and \nmarried people have a better chance of surviving cancer.\u0014",

As Hans Schlaffer left the Anabaptist \nmeeting in Schwaz, he was headed up the Inn River toward his home in \nthe mountains of Austria. There he planned to sit out the winter \nmonths until Spring, when he would renew his ministry. But the plans \nof this former Roman Catholic priest received a rude shock.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 5, 1527, Hans Schlaffer was arrested by local \nRoman Catholic authorities. In nearby Frundsberg Castle, they \ntortured him and priests examined him about infant-baptism. Hans said \nthat according to scripture, a man had to \"hear, understand, believe, \nand receive\" God's word before being baptized. As he saw it, this \nalone counted as Christian baptism. Children need not be baptized and \nthe Lord did not command it because they were already his. He might \nhave added, as he had written--and was now demonstrating-- that \"the \nChristian life is not child's play; but bitter earnestness, truth, \ncourage and saintliness must be there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked on what foundation the Anabaptists rested, he replied, \n\"Our faith, actions, and baptism rest on nothing else than the \ncommandment of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHans was known as a master of prayer. On the day he was arrested, he \nhad been teaching his hearers about prayer. Two months later, on the \nnight before his execution (his head was cut off), he was still \nfocused on prayer. He wrote a last letter to his flock; it was \nsmuggled out of the castle and preserved for us. It read in part:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh Father in heaven, whoever lives in Christ your Son and suffers \nand dies with him will rise with him in glory to be in his Kingdom \nforever. This is how we have understood the holy Gospel. This is how \nwe understand Christ and his teachings, and this is how we now \nunderstand the word faith which we never understood like this before.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the letter he included a prayer. It concluded with these words:\u0014\n\"Eternal Father! We pray that You will send workers into Your \nvineyard; for the harvest is great, while the laborers are few. We \npray for all those who carry Your gospel throughout the whole world, \nthat You will strengthen them with the power of Your holy spirit, \nthat in them all the terror of man may be quenched and that they will \nnot renounce Your Word through fear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sustain us in Your Holy Name, and let us not wander away from You, \nfountain of living waters, that we may hold fast to the true faith \nfirm unto the end.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptist History.

Liberals won \ncontrol of the school. On this day, January 24, 1722, they appointed \nEdward Wigglesworth to fill the newly created Thomas Hollis chair at \nHarvard College. This made Mr. Wigglesworth the first divinity \nprofessor commissioned in the American colonies, but what should have \nbeen cause for rejoicing was actually reason to mourn.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Wigglesworth had convinced orthodox members his theology was \nsound, it was not. In Three Centuries of Harvard, Samuel Eliot \nMorison described what happened next: \"One of the first theologians \nin New England who dared publicly to challenge the 'five points of \nCalvinism,' he [Wigglesworth] employed the deadly method of doubt in \ninquiry, rather than direct attack... Wigglesworth was a prime \nfavorite with Harvard students, and he and his son Edward, who \nsucceeded, had a very great influence on New England theology. It was \nthe Wigglesworths who trained the pioneers of liberal Christianity in \nNew England--the ministers who led the way out of the lush but \nfearsome jungles of Calvinism, into the thin, clear light of \nUnitarianism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the evangelist George Whitefield came to the United States, he \ndenounced liberal colleges as \"abodes of darkness, a darkness which \ncould be felt.\" The men of Harvard were \"Pharisees, resting on head \nknowledge,\" he said. Wigglesworth retorted that Whitefield was \nfiscally corrupt, demonstrated bad manners and unleashed dangerous \nenthusiasm among the masses, destroying the peace of New England's \nparishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1701, Yale was founded to counter Harvard's drift from orthodox \nCalvinism. By 1805, Unitarians controlled Harvard. Had Wigglesworth \nhad a fervent faith, his appointment this day might have prevented \nthat slide to heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDictionary of American Biography.

    "words": "Harriet Tubman was born a slave in 1821 near the eastern shore of \nMaryland. When she heard that her deceased master's property would be \nsold she escaped to freedom in Pennsylvania. When she discovered what \nit was to be free, she wanted to help other people to freedom. She \nknew that her efforts would require money and therefore she worked \npart-time jobs until she had enough money for her first mission. She \ntraveled to Baltimore and rescued her sister and her two children. \nShe made at least fifteen trips to the south and lead at least 200 \npeople to freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll Harriet Tubman's trips were successful because she was a master \nin planning the strategy of each of her escape operations. No detail \nwas missed by her. She planned for food, clothing, train tickets and \nforged passes. She even included sedatives for crying babies. She \nnever lost a passenger. On at least one occasion, she threatened to \nshoot a passenger who had second thoughts about escaping. The \novernight stops on what came to be known as the Underground Railroad \nwere a network of homes and churches. The churches raised money to \nassist Tubman's efforts. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Harriet Tubman supported the war \neffort as a nurse, a cook and a scout for the Union Army. Whatever \nshe did, her services were always welcome. Tubman received official \ncommendations from numerous Union Army officers. It is said that no \nofficer failed to tip his hat when he saw her. Despite her efforts \nfor the war, she received no veterans benefits of her own. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer reputation for freeing slaves was known throughout the slave \ncommunity. She was often compared to Moses who led the Israelites of \nthe Bible to freedom. Her contemporaries referred to her as a \nheroine, saying \"her likes it is probable was never known before or \nsince.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout her life Harriet Tubman maintained an interest in the \nwelfare of others. She raised money for schools, former slaves, \ndestitute children and assisted the sick and the disabled. Toward the \nend of her life Harriet Tubman worked to establish a home for the \nelderly. She passed away in 1913 in the \"Harriet Tubman Home for Aged \nand Indigent Colored People.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe singer Paul Robeson would sing the spiritual \"Go Down Moses\" and \nexplain that it was a protest song of slaves who had Harriet Tubman \nin mind. \u0014\n\u0014\nGo down Moses, Way down in Egypt land, Tell ole pharaoh, Let my \npeople go.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW THE INTERNET BROUGHT DOWN A DICTATOR",
    "words": "By Wilson Rothman\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Jan. 27, just before the Egyptian government turned off the \nInternet for all Egyptians, Facebook saw six times more traffic than \nGoogle inside the country. Then came the outage. Then came the \nprotests. Two weeks later, and with relatively little bloodshed, the \n30-year government of Hosni Mubarak ended. It's indisputable that the \nInternet and social media played a pivotal role. In fact, the \nrevolution may not have happened without them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did it happen? Will historians call this the first Internet \nrevolution? And most importantly, is this the start of a domino \neffect?\u0014\n\u0014\nTime for change\u0014\nA recent WikiLeak suggests that the seeds of the February 2011 \nrevolution were already sown by late 2008, by activists called the \nApril 6 Youth Movement who wanted to unseat Mubarak prior to the \nscheduled September 2011 elections. Yet few doubt that much of the \nmomentum built in June 2010, when a Google employee named Wael Ghonim \nanonymously started a Facebook page to commemorate the death of \nKhaled Said, beaten to death by police for flaunting drug possession \nonline.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wildfire flame of social networking burned quickly. In just a few \nweeks, Ghonim's page  We are all Khaled Said  had accumulated \n130,000 fans, according to the New York Times. Ghonim this week said \nthat the page has 375,000 followers. (The English-language site \nvisible to U.S. Facebookers has just over 71,000 followers.) In a \ncountry with around 5 million Facebook users, that is a large \npercentile, and doesn't count Facebook users who may visit the page \nwithout \"liking\" it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere there had been scattered planning, mostly in secret  the \nWikiLeaks document was not even clear whether or not the \"sensitive\" \nrevolutionary plan was on the Internet  there was now public online \ngathering. The page served as an independent monitor of the November \nand December 2010 parliamentary elections, considered by many to be \nfraudulent. Anger built, as did the popularity of Facebook and \nTwitter as a means to vent that anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, turmoil in Tunisia boiled over, thanks largely to \nsocial media. An exiled video blogger was thanked for his role in \nsending a repressive dictator packing, while another blogger was \nnamed junior minister for communications in the interim government. \nThe relatively poor country of 10 million had 4 million Internet \nusers; restrictions were not enough to stop the social-media-fueled \nupheaval.\u0014\n\u0014\nEgyptian activists, perhaps prodded by the success of the Tunisian \nrevolt, used Facebook to organize a demonstration that started on \nJan. 25. The Khaled Said page and the page run by the April 6 Youth \nMovement, itself with tens of thousands of followers, both advertised \nthe protests, news of which also blew through Twitter and over mobile \nphones via SMS.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Philip N. Howard, director of the Project on Information \nTechnology and Political Islam at the University of Washington, the \nturn-off-the-Internet strategy was not employed to block opposing \nfactions from organizing. The government did it specifically because \nit feared the amplification of true grass roots outrage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The real threat to the regime is people will take pictures of the \npolice beating their brothers and sisters, and the regime can't \nrespond well to Facebook images of the police shooting rubber bullets \ninto a crowd,\" Howard told msnbc.com on Jan. 28. \"There is no regime \nresponse for those images that go out over trusted networks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis made the Egyptian government nervous, to put it mildly. And they \npulled the plug.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This cost Egypt tens of millions of dollars per day for lost \ne-business,\" Cowie said. It would make sense to assume, even, that \nthe protesters themselves were not the ones hardest hit by the \nfinancial losses. Presumably big businesses, with interest in a \nstable Egypt, were harmed by the government-mandated outage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo when, on Feb. 2, Egypt's Internet connections sprang back to life, \nit was not surprising that things resumed as they had left off \nbefore. (In fact, the outage streamlined certain connections, if \nanything making Egypt's Internet network run even better than before.)\u0014\nBut the damage to the administration was done.\u0014",

    "words": "Heresies In Early Church\u0014\n\u0014\n In the fourth century A.D. Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, began \nto propagate the view that Jesus though the Son of God, could not be \nco-eternal with His Father and that He must be regarded as external \nto the divine essence and only a creature. Arius held that Christ was \nnot true God. Our text calls Christ, \"the Word,\" making Him a Person \nin the Trinity. Arianism could be classified as the progenitor of \nmodern Unitarianism. \u0014\n\u0014\n In the fourth century, Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea in Syria, \nwrote against Arianism and other heresies. Zealously wishing to \nmaintain the true error of denying Christ's full humanity, he \ndeclared that Christ had a human body but did not possess a human \nspirit. The complete true proper humanity of Jesus was thus denied. \u0014\n\u0014\n In the fifth century, Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, taught \nthat Christ was both God and man, but that the Godhead was one \nPerson, the manhood another. Instead of a union of two natures with \ndistinction, Nestorians taught that there were two persons. \u0014\n\u0014\n In this same era lived Eutyches, a monk of Constantinople, who was a \nzealous foe of Nestorianism: yet he proposed another strange theory \nconcerning the nature of our Lord. The Christological view of \nEutyches was that the human nature of Christ is absorbed into the \ndivine; yet Eutychianism holds firmly to one nature, the divine in \nChrist. This made the humanity of Christ a mere accident of the \nimmovable divine substance. \u0014\n\u0014\n The early church met these heretics with four adverbs which briefly \nand conveniently defined the two natures in Christ's Person. They \nsaid that when \"the Word was made flesh\" the divine and the human \nnatures were united \"truly\", to oppose the Arians; \"perfectly,\" to \noppose the Apollinarians; \"undividedly,\" to oppose the Nestorians; \nand \"unmixedly,\" to oppose the Eutychians.\u0014",

    "words": "April 13, 1742 \u0014\n\u0014\nHallelujah! Handel's Masterpiece\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAt twelve noon, on this date, April 13, 1742, the world first heard \nthe lovely overture, memorable arias and majestic choruses of the \nmost famous oratorio ever written. There has not been a year since \nthen that George Frederick Handel's Messiah has not been performed in \nconcert halls around the world. Usually it appears in numerous halls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe performance took place in Dublin, in the Fishamble Street Musick \nHall. Dubliners received it with enthusiasm. \"...the best judges \nallowed it to be the most finished piece of music,\" wrote the Dublin \nGazette. \"Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it \nafforded...\" Two performances were given. Two years later, annual \nperformances were established in Dublin. London did not receive the \noratorio as readily. Criticized, it did not catch on there until 1749.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel had turned to oratorios, most of them on religious themes, \nafter opera failed him. Messiah was special even within its genre. \nThe composer deliberately wrote it so that it could be performed by \nas few as four singers with strings, continuo, two drums and two \ntrumpets. The idea was to produce a work which could be staged \nanywhere. Handel was often near destitution, and a piece like \nMessiah, which could be performed by small ensembles, offered him \nopportunities to raise desperately needed cash.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe text, by Charles Jennens, pulled together fragments of scripture \nrelating to Christ. The power of the scriptures came by laying them \nforth almost as translated (he used more than one translation where \nit suited his purpose) and joining them so that they built on and \nclarified one another without comment. Old and New Testament passages \nwere placed beside each other where a relationship existed. Where \nJennens modified passages, he did so to make them scan better and to \nkeep the texts in the third tense throughout. Handel, although a \nrough-tongued man, claimed to know the Bible as well as any bishop \nand made a few alterations himself. Jennens, a devout Anglican, \nintended through his libretto to challenge the Deists who denied \nChrist's divinity: \"And his name shall be called Wonderful, \nCounselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of \nPeace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe succeeded in his intent, for Messiah portrays Christ as Son of \nGod, the fulfillment of prophecy, Savior of the world, and coming \nKing. John Newton, slaver turned clergyman, preached fifty sermons on \nthe text. Although Newton preached his series as a rebuke to those \nwho glorified the music above God's word, he said that it \ncomprehended all the principle truths of the Gospel. That Jennens \nfused the words together without once backtracking or repeating a \npassage demonstrates the perfectionism which made him a fussy person.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel united the whole into a magnificent artwork, writing the work \nin twenty-three fervent days, despite having already suffered a \nstroke. The music often rises to great loveliness and power. Passion \nbuilds until the climactic Hallelujah chorus. Of this chorus, Handel \nsaid in his broken English, \"I did think I did see all heaven before \nme and the great God himself!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBarne, Kitty.

Most of the \nfunds came from the sale of a television station and a radio station, \na Family Radio spokesman said. But some donors sacrificed their \nlife's fortunes, even jobs, in anticipation for the \"guaranteed\" end \nand are now in dire financial straits; others are simply frustrated \nand in search of recompense. With millions of dollars in family \nestates, wills, and personal funds pledged in support of a now \ndefunct prophecy, is there any legal recourse for donors?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf history is any indication, it would be difficult, if not \nimpossible for a lawsuit to move forward against Harold Camping and \nFamily Radio. The plea of donors for legal protection against false \nreligious claims hearkens back to United States v. Ballard (1944), in \nwhich leaders of the \"I AM\" movement, a New Age group, were charged \nwith fraudulently collecting donations in exchange for religious \nfavors they knew to be nonexistent. In the 5-4 decision, the Supreme \nCourt reversed the leaders' conviction, ruling that courts cannot \ndeclare religious beliefs true or false or interpret the sincerity of \none's beliefs without clear evidence of self-contradiction\u0014\n\u0014\n\"United States v. Ballard certainly suggests that it will be \ndifficult [for a case against Family Radio] to succeed on a fraud \nclaim based on false religious statements,\" said Alan Brownstein, a \nnoted constitutional law professor at the University of California, \nDavis. To move forward in court, a case against Family Radio would \nhave to incontestably prove that the organization did not believe the \nend of the world would come May 21 and that members of the \norganization used donations for unlawful financial gain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even this sort of case would be difficult to win, said Thomas \nBerg, professor of law and public policy at the University of St. \nThomas.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To determine that such statements were intentionally false, a civil \ncourt would have to go deeply into evaluating religious judgments and \nreligious states of mind, and such evaluations are barred by both \nreligion clauses of the First Amendment,\" he said.\u0014",

    "words": "HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND\u0014\nMark 3:20\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes a man drops a remark which cannot be interpreted otherwise \nthan as the product of bitter experience. Once when Jesus was \nenumerating the things which a man might have to face for following \nhim, he said, \"A man's foes will be those of his own household.\" \n(Matt 10:36.) His own family had come to the conclusion that he had \ntaken leave of his senses and that it was time he was taken home. Let \nus see if we can understand what made them feel like that. \u0014\n\u0014\n(i) Jesus had left home and the carpenter's business at Nazareth. No \ndoubt it was a flourishing business from which he could at least have \nmade a living; and quite suddenly he had flung the whole thing up and \ngone out to be a wandering preacher. No sensible man, they must have \nbeen thinking, would throw up a business where the money came in \nevery week to become a vagrant who had not any place to lay his head. \u0014\n\u0014\n(ii) Jesus was obviously on the way to a head-on collision with the \northodox leaders of his day. There are certain people who can do a \nman a great deal of harm, people on whose right side it is better to \nkeep, people whose opposition can be very dangerous. No sensible man, \nthey must have been thinking, would ever get up against the powers \nthat be, because he would know that in any collision with them he \nwould be bound to come off second best. No one could take on the \nScribes and the Pharisees and the orthodox leaders and hope to get \naway with it. \u0014\n\u0014\n(iii) Jesus had newly started a little society of his own--and a very \nqueer society it was. There were some fishermen; there was a reformed \ntax-collector; there was a fanatical nationalist. They were not the \nkind of people whom any ambitious man would particularly want to \nknow. They certainly were not the kind of people who would be any \ngood to a man who was set on a career. No sensible man, they must \nhave been thinking, would pick a crowd of friends like that. They \nwere definitely not the kind of people a prudent man would want to \nget mixed up with. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy his actions Jesus had made it clear that the three laws by which \nmen tend to organize their lives meant nothing to him. \u0014\n\u0014\n(i) He had thrown away security. The one thing that most people in \nthis world want more than anything else is just that. They want above \nall things a job and a position which are secure, and where there are \nas few material and financial risks as possible. \u0014\n\u0014\n(ii) He had thrown away safety. Most people tend at all times to play \nsafe. They are more concerned with the safety of any course of action \nthan with its moral quality, its rightness or its wrongness. A course \nof action which involves risk is something from which they \ninstinctively shrink. \u0014\n\u0014\n(iii) He had shown himself utterly indifferent to the verdict of \nsociety. He had shown that he did not much care what men said about \nhim. In point of fact, as H. G. Wells said, for most people \"the \nvoice of their neighbours is louder than the voice of God.\" \"What \nwill people say?\" is one of the first questions that most of us are \nin the habit of asking. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat appalled Jesus' friends was the risks that he was taking, risks \nwhich, as they thought, no sensible man would take.\u0014",

    "title": "HUMAN SACRIFICE REDUX",
    "words": "Human Sacrifice Redux \u0014\nHow the church battles deadly prophets in its midst. \u0014\nBy Obed Minchakpu in Jos | posted 12/01/2004 \u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to persistent reports of human sacrifice last August, \npolice raided several shrines of African traditional religionists in \nOkija, Anambra state, in largely Christian southern Nigeria. The \nreports had understated the problem. To their horror, authorities \nrecovered more than 80 skulls and 50 fresh corpses. In these shrines, \nthe police recovered three registers. They list 1,258 visitors who \nhad allegedly come to offer human sacrifices in the past five years.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians say the raid was an answer to their prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast Easter, Christians in Okija began praying and fasting for \ndeliverance from the gods of the traditionalists. Ifeanyi Atueyi, a \nChristian pharmacist, said idol worship had desecrated the land. \"We \nbelieve that the problems holding us down are these idols, and so we \ncentered our prayers on these idols. I never knew God can intervene \nso quickly and in this way,\" Atueyi said. \"It is marvelous and very \ndramatic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most adherents of African traditional polytheism practice their \nbeliefs peacefully, a minority engages in ritual killings. Precise \nfigures on the phenomenon are impossible to obtain. However, the bbc \nreports that police in South Africa estimate that hundreds of \nchildren have died so their body parts could be used in potions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002, London police discovered the mutilated torso of a young boy \nfloating in the Thames. The boy was apparently the victim of a West \nAfrican ritual for good luck. European authorities say such \nsacrifices have probably reached double figures across the continent \nin immigrant communities. Police believe the boy may have been \nsacrificed to one of the 400 ancestor gods of the Yoruba, Nigeria's \nsecond-largest people group.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Christians in the Idepe and Ogute villages in southwestern \nNigeria, February and March every year are anxious periods, when \nanimists hold their fetish festivals of sacrifice, which usually last \nfor 21 days. Minority groups of Christians are banned from worshiping \nin their churches. Last February 27, animists burned down two \nchurches in the states of Ondo and Edo that defied their ban on \nchurch activities. Joshua Ogunele, Anglican bishop of the Ikale \ndiocese, told CT that traditionalists also burned down two churches \nin 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnimists say their gods dislike Christian worship during the \nreligious festival. \"This is a taboo,\" the chief priest of the \nreligious group told CT in Ogute village.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians are responding on a number of fronts. Earlier this year, \nthree pastors and twenty-one other Christians from the town of Neke \nin Enugu state in southeastern Nigeria attempted to expose human \nsacrifices and idol worship by a traditionalist religious group that \nhas killed at least thirty-two people. For their efforts, they were \narraigned before the magistrate court in Ikem town, charged with \ndestroying the shrines where animists made their human sacrifices. \nTheir case is pending.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast May, Christians held an evangelistic crusade in Neke. They say \nmany animists in the area turned to Christ. But there is much work \nahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastor Joseph Agbo, a native of Neke, told CT he couldn't even guess \nthe number of people sacrificed in the community.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It will be like asking me to count the grains of sand on the \nseashore.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright \u00a9 2004 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information.\u0014\nRelated Elsewhere:\u0014",

The sale can be made on \nthe drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with \nthe drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. \nAbraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever \nhaving to move from his tent.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were \nsaying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew It \nwas known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also \ndeveloped a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the \nPeople (HTTP).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy \nhorsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical \nRich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS And lo, the land was so feverish \nwith joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no \none noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum \ndealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in \nthe land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work \nonly with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken \nover by others.\" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or \neBay as it came to be known. He said, \"We need a name that reflects \nwhat we are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \"YAHOO,\" \nsaid Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot \nCom.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic \nEducated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to \nlocate things around the countryside.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating \nEverything (GOOGLE).\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is how it all began. And that's the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would not make up this stuff.\u0014",

    "words": "Harriet \nBeecher Stowe, Abolitionist\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If I could use my pen as you can, I would write something that would \nmake this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is,\" \nHarriet Beecher Stowe's sister wrote her. Harriet vowed to write \nsomething. The result was Uncle Tom's Cabin. An international \nbestseller, it was adored by abolitionists but vilified by the South. \nIt so enflamed popular opinion that when she met Abraham Lincoln \nduring the war between the states he said, \"So this is the little \nlady who made this big war!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was born in Litchfield, Connecticut on this day June 14, \n1811, the sixth child of Lyman Beecher, an ardent Calvinist and \nPuritan. \"Wisht it had been a boy,\" remarked Lyman. Although he doted \non his daughters, he desired sons who could become preachers and \nsoul-winners. The fifth Beecher child had also been named Harriet, \nbut had died of whooping cough a few weeks after birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was often morbid while growing up as she struggled with \nissues of faith. But when she was fourteen, she cried to her father \nthat she had given herself to Christ. Later in her marriage to Calvin \nStowe, she would plead with him to seek Christ with the same burning \ndevotion with which he sought knowledge. \"If you had studied Christ \nwith half the energy that you have studied Luther ... then would he \nbe formed in you ... \" When he turned to spiritualism, she pleaded \nwith him, the biblical scholar, that it was unbiblical. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Harriet wrote many other books and stories, Uncle Tom's \nCabin is her best. Blacks are shown as fully human and, more \nimportantly, as created in the image of Christ. Many of the \ncharacters, such as Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, Eva and Topsy are vivid \nand memorable. Eliza, crossing the Ohio river by leaping from chunk \nto chunk of ice, is an unforgettable picture and is based on the true \naccount of a desperate fugitive.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics were harsh. When one of Harriet's children died, some said \nGod had taken the babe to keep Harriet from growing vain over her \nsuccess. She replied, \"I wrote what I did because as a woman, as a \nmother, I was oppressed & brokenhearted, with the sorrows & injustice \nI saw, because as a Christian I felt the dishonor to \nChristianity--because as a lover of my country I trembled at the \ncoming day of wrath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was always in financial difficulty. Neither she nor Calvin \nunderstood money management. After her literary success, they built \nan expensive house which turned into a money pit. Bad investments \ngobbled up thousands more dollars. The Stowes also suffered in other \nways. Calvin was a hypochondriac. A rapid succession of children left \nHarriet weak. One son predeceased the parents. Another became an \nalcoholic and disappeared from sight. Harriet also was loudly berated \nfor her defense of Lady Byron. Her last ten years she lived in a \nnever-never world, no longer fixed to reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, John. One Hundred Great Lives.

God is only one divine being, who plays different roles \nat different times. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct \npersons of the same essence, but different modes or expressions of a \nsingle person. Modalism naturally leads to Patripassianismthe belief \nthat the Father literally suffered on the cross.\u0014\nKey text? Philippians 2:6: . . . being in the form of God . . .\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Oneness Pentecostalism believes that \nGods three modes of existence can act simultaneously, though God is \nstill only one person.\u0014\n\u0014\nSubordinationism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Eusebius of Caesarea (263339)\u0014\nWhat is it? The Son and the Spirit are divine persons, distinct from \nthe Father but inferior to him. All three persons are truly God, but \nthey exist in a hierarchy of power and authority.\u0014\nKey text? Matthew 26:39: . . . not as I will, but as you will.\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? According to a 2014 LifeWay Research \nstudy, 22 percent of evangelicals believe the Father is more divine \nthan the Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Jesus Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nArianism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Arius (c. 256336)\u0014\nWhat is it? The Son as Word (Logos, in Greek) was created by God \nbefore time. He is not eternal or perfect like God, though he was \nGods agent in creating everything else.\u0014\nKey Text? John 1:14: The Word [is] the only Son, who came from the \nFather.\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Jehovahs Witnesses believe Jesus is \nGods only direct creation, and that everything else was created by \nChrist. Jesus died for our sins, but he is not equal with God, who is \nnot part of a Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nDocetism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Docetai, a Gnostic sect (2nd and 3rd centuries)\u0014\nWhat is it? The divine Christ would never stoop to touch flesh, which \nis evil. Jesus only seemed (dokeo, in Greek) human and only appeared \nto die, for God cannot die. Or, the divine Christ left the human \nJesus before the Crucifixion.\u0014\nKey text? Philippians 2:8: . . . and being found in appearance as a \nman . . .\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Docetism by and large has been defeated, \nthough many pastors report confusion among their congregants \nregarding Christs full humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdoptionism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Paul of Samosata (3rd century)\u0014\nWhat is it? Jesus was a mere man before his baptism, when the Father \nadopted him as his Son. The Father and Son are of different \nnaturesthe Father preexistent and eternally divine, and the Son born \nas Jesus and adopted into the Fathers plans, but never one in \nessence with the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey text? Luke 3:22 (in some ancient versions): You are my beloved \nSon; today I have begotten you.\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Adoptionism by and large has been \ndefeated.\u0014\n\u0014\nApollinarianism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Apollinaris of Laodicea (4th century)\u0014\nWhat is it? Jesus is not equally human and divine, but one person \nwith one nature. In Jesus human flesh resided a divine mind (he \ndidnt have a human mind). Thus, Jesus was only two-thirds human.\u0014\nKey text? John 1:14: The Word became flesh [and not a human mind].\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Apollinarianism by and large has been \ndefeated, though many pastors report confusion among their \ncongregants regarding Christs full humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the Holy Spirit\u0014\n\u0014\nPneumatomachianism\u0014\nWho taught it? Semi-Arians (4th century)\u0014\nWhat is it? During the latter half of the fourth century, sects like \nSemi-Arians and Pneumatomachi (Greek for Spirit fighters) believed \nthe Spirit was of a different essence from the Father and the Son. \nSome said the Spirit was a creature, and others understood the Spirit \nto be a force or power, not a person.\u0014\nKey text? Acts 1:8: . . . you will receive power when the Holy \nSpirit comes on you . . .\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Among Jehovahs Witnessesbut also among \nevangelicals.

    "title": "HOMELESS MAN TURNS IN $17,000 AT FOOD BANK",
    "words": "Washington Post, 12/6/18\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly one morning, Kevin Booth, who is homeless, was \u0014\nhungry. So he went to his local food bank in Sumner, Wash., \u0014\nlooking for the bread that is left outside overnight for people to \u0014\ntake. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut instead of the bread box, a brown paper bag outside the \u0014\nlocked front door caught his attention that morning late this \u0014\npast summer. Perhaps it held food. So Booth opened the bag, \u0014\nand saw it was filled with cash -$17,000. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"At first, I was like, what the heck is that lying on the \u0014\nground?\" Booth, 32, said in an interview with the local news- \u0014\npaper, The News Tribune in Tacoma. He looked inside and saw \u0014\nstacks of money, then slid out a $20 bill. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Of course, I sniffed it to see if it was real,\" he told The News \u0014\nTribune. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt smelled legitimate. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then I was like, do I take off or do I stay?\" he told the paper. \u0014\nHe didn't know how much cash was there at the time, but \u0014\nhe knew it wasn't his. \u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nSo he hung around the Sumner Community Food Bank \u0014\nuntil it opened about 20 minutes later, and he handed the \u0014\ntreasure bag to a volunteer who cracked the door for him at \u0014\n7:30a.m. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He said, 'This is for you. Somebody left it on your door- \u0014\nstep,\" Anita Miller, director of the food bank, said in an inter- \u0014\nview with The Washington Post. The volunteer initially \u0014\nthought it was food and weighed the package, as is rou- \u0014\ntine for all food donations. She quickly realized something was \u0014\namiss and called police. Inside were neat stacks of $20 and \u0014\n$100 bills. \u0014\n\u0014\nSumner police showed up, took possession of the money \u0014\nand opened an investigation. Nobody knew where thebag \u0014\nhad come from, and the food bank's security camera was \u0014\nnot functioning properly, so it did not pick up any useful \u0014\ninformation. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's strange for someone to leave a hunch of money like \u0014\nthat outside a food bank,\" said Sumner police officer Marcus \u0014\nMcDonald. Investigators checked with nearby police departments, \u0014\nthey looked into any robberies in the area, they checked for \u0014\nsuicidal people who may have withdrawn a large sum. They came\u0014\nup empty, McDonald said.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week, after the required 90 days had passed and nobody \u0014\nelse claimed the loot, police gave it back to the food bank in \u0014\na ceremony in which they also presented Booth with a citi- \u0014\nzen's citation for his honesty. \u0014\n\u0014\nPolice Chief Brad Moericke presented the citation to Booth. \u0014\n\"Not every citizen would be as honest as you in this situa- \u0014\ntion,\" Moericke told him, according to The News Tribune. \u0014\nThe food bank also is giving him a reward to thank him. \u0014\nMcDonald said many officers, including him, know \u0014\nBooth to be a good guy who sometimes hangs out with a \u0014\nrough crowd.\u0014\n\u0014\n To protect him, the food bank decided it will give him various gift \ncards over time rather than a lump sum of cash as a reward. \u0014\n\u0014\nMiller, the food bank director, said she and other volun- \u0014\nteers have known Booth for years, and they plan to help \u0014\nhim through the winter. Miller said Booth lives in a tent in \u0014\nnearby woods, and has turned down her offers of shelter. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We'll be able to get coats or shoes for him,\" Miller said. \"He \u0014\nwill not take a room and board. He turns down: inside living.\" \u0014\nMiller said the newfound money will go toward buying a \u0014\nwalk-in refrigerator and freezer for the food bank's planned ex- \u0014\npansion. She said she and the rest of the staff are grateful for \u0014\nBooth's integrity and decency. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor his part, Booth told The News Tribune: \"There \u0014\nare a lot of people who would have taken it. I'm just not that \u0014\nperson.\"\u0014",

God is only one divine being, who plays different roles \nat different times. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct \npersons of the same essence, but different modes or expressions of a \nsingle person. Modalism naturally leads to Patripassianismthe belief \nthat the Father literally suffered on the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey text? Philippians 2:6: . . . being in the form of God . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Oneness Pentecostalism believes that \nGods three modes of existence can act simultaneously, though God is \nstill only one person.\u0014\n\u0014\nSubordinationism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Eusebius of Caesarea (263339)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it? The Son and the Spirit are divine persons, distinct from \nthe Father but inferior to him. All three persons are truly God, but \nthey exist in a hierarchy of power and authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey text? Matthew 26:39: . . . not as I will, but as you will.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? According to a 2014 LifeWay Research \nstudy, 22 percent of evangelicals believe the Father is more divine \nthan the Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Jesus Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nArianism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Arius (c. 256336)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it? The Son as Word (Logos, in Greek) was created by God \nbefore time. He is not eternal or perfect like God, though he was \nGods agent in creating everything else.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey Text? John 1:14: The Word [is] the only Son, who came from the \nFather.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere does it show up today? Jehovahs Witnesses believe Jesus is \nGods only direct creation, and that everything else was created by \nChrist.

Docetai, a Gnostic sect (2nd and 3rd centuries)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it? The divine Christ would never stoop to touch flesh, which \nis evil. Jesus only seemed (dokeo, in Greek) human and only appeared \nto die, for God cannot die. Or, the divine Christ left the human \nJesus before the Crucifixion.\u0014\nKey text?

Docetism by and large has been defeated, \nthough many pastors report confusion among their congregants \nregarding Christs full humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdoptionism\u0014\n\u0014\nWho taught it? Paul of Samosata (3rd century)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it? Jesus was a mere man before his baptism, when the Father \nadopted him as his Son. The Father and Son are of different \nnaturesthe Father preexistent and eternally divine, and the Son born \nas Jesus and adopted into the Fathers plans, but never one in \nessence with the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey text?

Jesus is not equally human and divine, but one person \nwith one nature. In Jesus human flesh resided a divine mind (he \ndidnt have a human mind). Thus, Jesus was only two-thirds human.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey text? John 1:14: The Word became flesh [and not a human mind].\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere does it show up today?

    "title": "HISTORY'S TANGLED THREADS -- THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD",
    "words": "Historys Tangled Threads\u0014\n\u0014\nBy FERGUS M. BORDEWICH\u0014\nPublished: February 2, 2007\u0014\n\u0014\nFEW aspects of the American past have inspired more colorful \nmythology than the Underground Railroad. Its probably fair to say \nthat most Americans view it as a thrilling tapestry of midnight \nflights, hairbreadth escapes, mysterious codes and strange hiding \nplaces.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo its not surprising that the intriguing (if only recently \ninvented) tale of escape maps encoded in antebellum quilts  \nenshrined in a metastasizing library of childrens books and \nteachers lesson plans and perhaps even in a Central Park memorial to \nFrederick Douglass  should also seize the popular imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut faked history serves no one, especially when it buries important \ntruths that have been hidden far too long. The freedom quilt myth \nis just the newest acquisition in a congeries of bogus, often \nbizarre, legends attached to the Underground Railroad. Despite a lack \nof documentation, tales of actual tunnels through which fugitives \nsupposedly fled persist in communities from the Canadian border to \nthe Mason-Dixon Line.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular songs associated with the underground rarely withstand \nscrutiny, either. Recent research has revealed that the inspirational \nballad Follow the Drinking Gourd  perhaps the single best-known \nartifact of the Underground Railroad  was first published in 1928, \nand that much of the text and music as we know it today was actually \ncomposed by Lee Hays of the Weavers in 1947. Nor do its directions \nconform to any known underground route.\u0014\n\u0014\nLegend has also elevated to nearly superhuman status the underground \nconductor Harriet Tubman, typically claiming that she led north more \nthan 300 slaves. The actual number was closer to 70, according to a \nTubman biographer, Kate Clifford Larson. The truth takes nothing away \nfrom Tubman, a remarkable woman by any measure, but her deification \nas the embodiment of the Underground Railroad has obscured the work \nof many lesser-known African-American activists  among them New \nYorks David Ruggles, who organized the citys underground in the \n1830s and helped more than 600 former slaves to freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notion of maps hidden in quilts surfaced in the 1980s  in a \nchildrens book, according to a quilting historian, Leigh Fellner, \nwho has shown that many of the patterns supposed to contain coded \ndirections for fugitives date from the 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch fictions rely for their plausibility on the premise that the \noperations of the Underground Railroad were so secret that the truth \nis essentially unknowable. In fact, there is abundant documentation \nof the undergrounds activities to be found in antebellum antislavery \nnewspapers, narratives of escape written by former slaves and the \nrecollections of participants recorded after the Civil War, when \nthere was no longer danger of reprisal. None mention quilts, tunnels \nor, with the rarest of exceptions, any hiding place more exotic than \na barn or attic.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost successful fugitives were enterprising and well informed. The \nvast majority had little need for coded maps, since they came from \nthe border states of Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky, just a few \ndays or hours walk from the nearest free state.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Underground Railroad provided shelter, transportation and guides, \nbut through most of the North its work was hardly secret. \nAbolitionist newspapers reported news of fugitives in detail  their \npassage through town, the names of people whod assisted them. In \nsome places, activists distributed handbills announcing what they \nwere doing and how many fugitives they had helped. Jermain Loguen, \nthe African-American leader of the underground in Syracuse, \nadvertised his address in local newspapers as an aid to \nfreedom-seekers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe larger importance of the Underground Railroad lies not in \nfanciful legends, but in the diverse history of the men and women, \nblack and white, who made it work and in the far-reaching political \nand moral consequences of what they did. The Underground Railroad was \nthe nations first great movement of mass civil disobedience after \nthe American Revolution, engaging thousands of citizens in the active \nsubversion of federal law, as well as the first mass movement that \nasserted the principle of personal responsibility for others human \nrights. It was also the nations first interracial political \nmovement, which from its beginning in the 1790s joined free blacks, \nabolitionist whites and sometimes slaves in a collaboration that \nshattered racial taboos.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the long dark night of Jim Crow politics, these deeper truths \nof the Underground Railroad were suppressed: in a nation committed to \nsegregation and blind to racism, the story of a politically radical, \nbiracial movement led in part by African-Americans was far too \nsubversive to accept.\u0014\n\u0014\nEye-catching quilts and mysterious tunnels satisfy the human penchant \nfor easily digestible history. Myths deliver us the heroes we crave, \nand submerge the horrific reality of slavery in a gilded haze of \nuplift. But in claiming to honor the history of African-Americans, \nthey serve only to erase it in a new way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans still have a difficult time talking about race and slavery, \nand the Underground Railroad deserves to be part of the national \ndiscussion. It forced Americans to think about slavery in new ways, \nby delivering tens of thousands of former slaves into Northern \ncommunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere, for the first time, whites began to learn firsthand about the \nrealities of slavery  the physical and emotional cruelties, the \nruptured families, the abuse of enslaved women  and to empathize \nwith black Americans as people like themselves, with the same human \nneeds and desires, the same vulnerabilities, the same devotion to \nfamily and faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an age when self-interest has been elevated in our culture to a \npublic and political virtue, the Underground Railroad still has \nsomething to teach: that every individual, no matter how humble, can \nmake a difference in the world, and that the importance of ones life \nlies not in money or celebrity, but in doing the right thing, even in \nsilence or secrecy, and without reward. This truth doesnt need to be \nencoded in fiction in order to be heard.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFergus M. Bordewich is the author of Bound for Canaan: The \nUnderground Railroad and the War for the Soul of America.\u0014",

    "title": "HOW WORLD RELIGIONS VIEW POVERTY AND THE POOR",
    "words": "How Our Worlds Religions View Poverty and the Poor\u0014\n                              By William Brackney | February 22, 2019 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) \ndeclared, Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate to \nhimself and his family, including food, clothing, medical care and \nnecessary social services.\u0014\n\u0014\nDecades later, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), \nasserted that every child has the inherent right to life, including \nhealth care, nutritious foods and clean drinking water.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, estimates over the last five years indicate up to 80 percent \nof the worlds population live at some level of poverty, and almost \n400 million children live in poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is the denial of basic necessities and occurs in severe, \nmoderate and situational circumstances worldwide. The poor are \nthose who live in poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does religion speak into this basic human condition? How do the \nworlds religions understand poverty and what responses do they \npropose?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne might expect that religions adequately address or provide \nameliorative strategies to reduce or eliminate poverty.\u0014\nQuite the contrary, religious voices can justify or even enhance the \npermanency of poverty, some aspects of the Christian tradition being \nan exception.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us consider basic teachings of several of the great religions \nwith respect to poverty. What follows is summarized from Poverty and \nthe Poor in the Worlds Religions: Religious Responses to the Problem \nof Poverty, edited by William H. Brackney and Rupen Das.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Confucian tradition holds that poverty involves ones duties and \nneed to work hard; poverty as a social reality is not desirable. It \nmay be avoided by diligence, prudence and thriftiness. Poverty is \nalso a training ground for virtues. Through the family especially, \nhuman relationships require piety and selfless love. All societies \nmust work for the common good.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe various Buddhist traditions present an interconnected world in \nwhich humans create suffering for themselves and others, largely \nthrough cravings. The goal of Buddhist thinkers is to eliminate the \ncauses of suffering and to restructure society and reduce suffering \nboth individually and collectively. Poverty is the principal cause of \nsuffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish tradition recognizes the reality of poverty, especially as \nit is characteristic of Israelite history as a nation and a people. \nPoverty is interwoven in the Torah and Prophets. A legal structure, \nembedded in Judaism, plus in the Hebrew Scriptures, built a heritage \nof looking out for the poor. Regularly in the Jewish calendar, there \nare opportunities to understand and mitigate poverty. Popular images \nin the Jewish communities often depict the poor man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian tradition, founded upon the Jewish faith, recognizes \nthe original creation of a benevolent God but wrestles with \ninequities. Even Jesus, Christian thinkers remind, recognized the \ncontinued presence of the poor in his society. Institutionally, the \nChristian church devised means to care for the poor, and laws in \nChristian nations took account of moral responsibility to deal with \npoverty. As part of the Christian mission, Christians developed \nelaborate relief efforts and services to alleviate the effects of \npoverty. Some Christians also think that poverty has no value in the \nKingdom of God and must be eliminated.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Islamic teachings, God is the sole provider and sustainer of \npersons. The reality of poverty cannot be divorced from ones \nfaithfulness and obedience to Allah. Lack of piety, not trusting \nAllah, unrepentance and the influence of the satan are all reasons \nfor poverty. Muslim communities hold firmly to obligations to give \ncharity and share at key times during the year to alleviate the \neffects of being poor. Those who endure difficulties will be rewarded \nand, in some cases, being poor is good news for those entering the \nworld to come. Work is not degrading.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the major religions of India, the caste system or opposition \nto it are embedded in ones understanding of poverty. There is little \nobjection in Hinduism to the condition of poverty because it defines \na certain place among the castes. Hindu responses have been informed \nby modern economic theories and by ascetic lifestyles. Having good \nkarma can be achieved by hard work or a positive turn of events. \nAmong Jains, humans are responsible for their conditions, and that \nthrough meditation and self-culture, bad karma can be eliminated. For \nSikhs, poverty is a fact of life and may be avoided by a work ethic \nand practice of a life of humility. Sharing and tithing are virtues \nin Sikh communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn important conclusion of this inadequate survey is that, alone \namong the great religions, the Christian tradition provides a \nconsistent theological foundation for understanding and effectively \nameliorating poverty, primarily based upon the teachings of Jesus.\u0014",

    "title": "HOLOCAUST DAY: REMEMBRANCE AND RESOLVE",
    "words": "Holocaust Day: Remembrance and resolve \u0014\nby Dr. A. Jase Jones (1985)\u0014\n\u0014\nYom Hashoah\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the Hebrew words for Holocaust Day, an annual remembrance \nby the Jewish community of six million Jews who perished in Hitlers \ndeath camps. They call up other words from humanitys memories: \nEurope, 1933-1945; Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Goering, Eichmann, \nMengele, Heydrich; Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Babi-Yar, Auschwitz, \nDachau, Treblinka, Lidice. Words that throb with wails and drip with \ntears. Words that stir thoughts of emaciated bodies, of hollow, \ndeep-set eyes staring through barbed wire, of cattle cars crammed \nfull of hopeless people, of deep ditches filled with bodies, yellow \nstars, and small children holding on the hands of parents powerless \nto shield them from approaching death. Behind these words and making \nthem reality was the Nazi goal, the final solution to the Jewish \nproblem, or, less euphemistically, kill all Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish people have experienced many holocausts throughout their \nlong history. Today, in their homes, they know that another Holocaust \ncould erupt suddenly, like a long-dormant volcano. So, each year they \nstop on Holocaust Day (on April 18 in 1985) to remember their family \nmembers and friends who perished in Europes death camps, to remind \nthemselves that they are never to be free of the threat of a repeat \nof that madness, and to strengthen their resolve to do all in their \npower to prevent such a recurrence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ingredients of another Holocaust exist today. Anti-Semitism, or, \nmore precisely, anti-Jewishness, finds constant expression in the \nAmericas and Europe today. One has only to watch and read the news \nreports to find examples. On April 6, 1984, a newspaper article told \nof vandals in the Bronx, New York, who drew swastikas and painted \nslogans, such as, Kill all the Jews before Passover, on fifty-one \napartment doors, on the door-frames of which were mezuzahs (Jewish \nobjects containing words of Scripture, as enjoined in Deut. 6:9). \nNeo-Nazis spouted anti-Jewish hatred as they tried to march through \nthe streets of predominantly-Jewish Skokie, Illinois. The Nazi \nheadquarters building in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s sported huge \nblack swastikas painted against a blood-red background. A large white \nvan at the side bore several slogans. One of them read, Communism is \nJewish! and another, Gas van. Capacity: 70 Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth the potential victimizers and victims of another Holocaust exist \ntoday. People of the Nazis ilk are all around us, and, given the \nproper mental, emotional, economic, social, and political \ningredients, they would spring up like Johnson grass in a wet Texas \nspring. Hatred, bigotry, prejudice, cruelty, and brutality lie just \nunder humanitys skin. Their victims are also ready at hand. Instead \nof focusing attention on the death-camp victims of the Hitler era, \nwhose forms, with the passage of time, become shadowy, wraith-like, \nunreal, todays people should people a potential Holocaust scene with \nthe faces of their live Jewish acquaintances and friends, young and \nold, and say to themselves, In another Holocaust, people like my \nfriends  warm, loving, caring, patriotic, civic-minded  would be \nruthlessly, brutally, and without warning jerked out of their homes, \noffices, places of business, work areas, and schools, and carried \naway. It would be their faces looking through the barbed wire of some \ndeath camp, and smoke from their burning bodies filling the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians cannot, in good conscience, leave their Jewish friends to \nstand alone in the struggle to prevent a repetition of the Holocaust. \nThere are several reasons. First, the Holocaust was an evil thing, \nand Christians follow a righteous Lord who came to overthrow evil and \nestablish righteousness. Engaging in this struggle is an expression \nof loving neighbor as self, of being the Good Samaritan instead of \nthe callous passerby. Second, in Europe and the Americas, Christians \nform the majority and bear the responsibility for what transpires in \ntheir world. In Christian thinking, the strong bear responsibility \nfor the weak, the many for the few.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians need to realize that they are often a part of the problem. \nNow, it is altogether unlikely that a genuine Christian is going to \npaint swastikas or anti-Jewish slogans on walls or sidewalks. On the \nother hand, it is altogether likely that most Christians would deny \nthe presence of any anti-Jewishness in their make-up. Yet, Christians \ntoday, and good Christians, often totally unaware of the significance \nand possible consequences, think thoughts, countenance attitudes, and \nexpress themselves (even in their Christian literature) in ways that \nstoke the fires that power a future Holocausts engines. They do this \nby perpetuating derogatory and untrue misconceptions of Jewish \npeople, such as, all Jews are rich, Jews are arrogant, pushy, \nclannish, stingy (Isnt that just like a Jew?; but one never hears \nit said of a stingy non-Jew, Isnt that just like a non-Jew? or \nwords of praise for generous Jewish people by that person). They use \nthe phrase, Jewing them down. (Why does one not hear, Yankeeing \nthem down? Of course, shrewd bargaining in a Yankee brother becomes \nsomething virtuous.) Christians laugh at jokes that poke fun at Jews. \nThey repeat such canards as, The Jews killed Jesus, and The Jews \nrejected Jesus, not acknowledging in the first instance that it was \nmankinds sin, including their own, that put Jesus to death, and \nforgetting in the second instance that the twelve apostles were \nJewish, that all of the New Testament writers, save one, were Jewish, \nand that the greater part of the earliest Christian community were \nJewish. And, in poking fun at Jewish people, they overlook the fact \nthat their own Savior was an observant Jewish man, and that one \ncannot fully understand Jesus and what he taught until he is \ninterpreted against the background of his Jewishness and his Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nHolocaust Day is a time for all who love freedom and justice to \ndedicate self and substance to creating a realization of the presence \nand danger of anti-Jewishness and the part it plays in generating \nHolocausts. Communities throughout the land can follow the lead of \nDallas and Denver and Washington, D.C., in establishing centers and \nmuseums that memorialize the tragedy of Holocaust. Let Christians be \nsensitive to the presence in themselves of those attitudes, thoughts, \nwords, and deeds which express and perpetuate anti-Jewishness, and \npurge themselves of such things. Let them understand the significance \nof the struggle of modern Israel to survive the efforts of a hundred \nmillion of their neighbors to destroy the state and to drive its \ncitizens into the sea. Let Christians stand with their Jewish friends \non Holocaust Day, either in a synagogue service or in their own \nchurch Holocaust memorial service to which they invite Jewish \nfriends, and, by so doing say, We are beginning to understand. We \nsorrow with you in your remembrance of those who perished. We join in \nthe struggle against the persecution which has so often afflicted \nyou. Show us where we have failed; show us how we can help.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us close with a little what if exercise. What if the Holocaust \nhad not happened? What if six million Jews had not been killed? Six \nmillion from a people who gave us Moses, Jesus, Paul; Freud, \nEinstein, Salk, and Sabin; Brandeis, Cardozo, and Frankfurter; \nMenuhin, Heifetz, Stern, and Perlman. Of the first five of these, it \ncan be said that they changed the course of human history. Think of \nhow poor our world would be if they, and thousands of other gifted \nJewish people, had not lived. Then, post-Holocaust, think of how much \nricher our world would now be if the Einsteins and Salks and Menuhins \namong that six million had been allowed to live and contribute their \ngifts to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nHolocaust Day! Remembrance, yes. Resolve, also, that the world will \nnever again suffer such a tragic loss.\u0014",

    "words": "Beatrice G. Cole wrote  a story for Reader's Digest some years ago \nentitled \"Hilda's Gift\".\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOne glance at the timid new student in my class left me with a \nhollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. Hilda had frail, bony knees, \nstraggly black hair, sallow skin and her threadbare clothes hung \nawkwardly on her tiny body. Her haunting need for love was reflected \nin the vacant look of defeat I had seen many times in my twenty-two \nyears as a teacher of mentally retarded children.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMost of the children in my class were from middle or upper-class \nhomes, and their lunch boxes were filled with fried chicken or \nsandwiches piled high with ham, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Their \ncolorful, tempting desserts rivaled the most luscious pictures in \ngourmet magazines.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut Hilda's lunch, in a greasy brown paper sack, was two fried eggs \nin cold biscuitsand a moon pie for dessert.\u0014\n\t\t\u0014\n\tAlmost every day I complimented Hilda on her good taste in desserts \nand told her how much I like moon pies too.  Each time her eyes \nseemed to come alive in response, and I could feel her reaching out \nto me. Before many weeks, she began to follow me around, tenderly \ntouching my skirt, and shyly whispering, \"Teacher, me love you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe early months of school seemed to race by, and suddenly it was \ntime for our Christmas party. Squeals of laughter and joy rocked the \nbuilding as the Jolly Good Fellow arrived and gave gifts to all, and \nthen kissed the teacher.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen the last \"HO, HO!\" was said, and the happy children were on \ntheir way home, I dropped into a chair, slipped off my shoes and \nopened the gifts the children had brought for metasteful gifts, \ngaily wrapped by mothers who had dutifully purchased them at the \nshopping center. Then I saw my name crudely printed with a black \ncrayon on the side of a greasy brown paper sack.  Hardly knowing what \nto expect, I opened the bag and slowly pulled out the contentsa moon \npie with one bite gone!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMy eyes blurred with tears, and a lump rose in my throat as I \nrealized Hilda understood Christmas better than all the rest of us.  \nShe had given of all she hadwhat she loved the best of all.\u0014",

    "title": "HILLEL AND SHAMMAI, JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SCHOLARS",
    "words": "Hillel and his descendants established academies of learning and were \nthe leaders of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel for several \ncenturies. The Hillel dynasty ended with the death of Hillel II in \n365 CE.\u0014\n\u0014\nHillel the Elders friendly adversary was Shammai, a native of the \nLand of Israel about whom little is known except that he was a \nbuilder, known for the strictness of his views. He was reputed to be \ndour, quick-tempered and impatient. Both lived during the reign of \nKing Herod (37-4 BCE), an oppressive period in Jewish history because \nof the Roman occupation of the Land of Israel. Shammai was concerned \nthat if Jews had too much contact with the Romans, the Jewish \ncommunity would be weakened, and this attitude was reflected in his \nstrict interpretation of Jewish law. Hillel did not share Shammai's \nfear and therefore was more liberal in his view of law.\u0014\n\u0014\nHillel was the more popular of the two scholars, and he was chosen by \nthe Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish court, to serve as its president. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Hillel and Shammai themselves did not differ on a great many \nbasic issues of Jewish law, their disciples were often in conflict. \nThe Talmud records over 300 differences of opinion between Beit \nHillel (the House of Hillel) and Beit Shammai (the House of Shammai). \nThe Rabbis of the Talmud generally sided with the rulings of the \nSchool of Hillel, although the Sages believed that both views were \nvalid. Sixteenth-century kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria (the Ari) said \nthat not only are both the words of the House of Shammai and the \nHouse of Hillel enduring on the conceptual level, but each has its \ntime and place on the pragmatic level as well. In our present world, \nwe follow the rulings of the House of Hillel, but in the era of \nMessiah, the majority opinion will shift in favor of the House of \nShammai, and their rulings will then be implemented. The Ari believed \nthat in our present reality, where divine commandments must be \nimposed upon an imperfect world, the rulings of the House of Hillel \nrepresent the ultimate in conformity to the divine will, while the \nrulings of the House of Shammai represent an ideal that is too lofty \nfor our present state (which is why we perceive them as stricter \nand more confining), and can only be realized on the conceptual \nlevel. In the era of Messiah, the situation will be reversed: a \nperfected world will embrace the more exacting application of Torah \nlaw expressed by the House of Shammai, while the Hillelian school of \ninterpretation will endure only conceptually.\u0014",

In recognition of their \nsacrifice, the Russian newspaper Pravda published this poem:\u0014\n\u0014\n  God is in a man who walked into a radiated complex,\u0014\n  Put out the fire, burned his skin and clothes,\u0014\n  Who didn't save himself,\u0014\n  But saved Odessa and Kiev,\u0014\n  A man who simply acted like a human being.\u0014\n\u0014\n  An American bone transplant specialist, Dr. Robert Gale, also \nassisted the Soviets.  As evidence of their gratitude, the poem went \non to say that god was also in Dr. Gale.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Russia, of course, is atheistic, and many of her people do not \nbelieve in God, yet Pravda's use of the term \"god\" is significant.  \nIt reminds us of the kind of impact the apostle Paul wanted his life \nto have.  His deep desire was that others would see in his life so \nmuch love and self-sacrifice that they would find it natural to give \ncredit to God.  He believed that people observing him as he faced \ndanger and endured persecution would see the glory of Christ's \npresence in his life.\u0014",

In the \ndream a voice bade him to take a journey to Prague and to look for \ntreasure under the bridge which leads to the king's palace. Rabbi \nEisek did not pay attention to his dream that first night, except to \nnote it.  On the second night when he had the exact same dream, he \nbegan to get more restless.  On the third night when the same voice \nbade him with a sense of urgency to go to Prague and look for the \ntreasure beneath the bridge leading to the king's castle, he awoke \nthe next morning, put on his walking shoes, and set out on the long \njourney to Prague.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"When Rabbi Eisek got there, he found that the bridge was guarded \nby day and night. Nevertheless, he went to the bridge every morning \nand kept walking around it until evening. Finally, the captain of the \nguards, who had been watching him, asked him in a kindly way if he \nwas looking for something or waiting for somebody. Rabbi Eisek told \nhim of the dream which had brought him there from a faraway city.  \nThe captain laughed and said, `And so to please the dream, you poor \nfellow, you wore out your shoes to come here!  As for having faith in \ndreams, if I had listened to my dreams, I should have had to make a \ntrip to Cracow and dig for treasure under the stove in the room of a \nJew, a Rabbi Eisek, son of Yekel...that was the name, yes, Eisek, son \nof Yekel.  I can just imagine what that would be like, how I should \nhave to try every house where half of the Jews are named Eisek and \nthe other half Yekel!'

His \nwife and children were delighted at the prospect of working together \nin a slow-paced family business.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The problem was that a change of location didn't change the man's \napproach to life.  He still had this tremendous need to prove \nhimself. It took him less than five years to turn that run- down \nlittle marina into a multimillion-dollar operation.  A friend said to \nhim, \"You must be very proud of this marina.\"  His reply was bitter: \n\"No, every time I look at it, I feel sick at my stomach.  This \nbusiness has cost me everything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   During those five years, his wife gave up hope that he would ever \nchange and left him.  His kids eventually went their own way.  His \noverextended schedule kept him from being involved in church or any \nspiritual pursuits.  And the stress of running the business had \nworsened his heart condition.  He had wanted to break out of the \ncycle of overwork, but because of his insecurity he fell into the \ntrap of making all the same mistakes over again.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Honest to God by Bill Hybels.
