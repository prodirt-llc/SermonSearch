    "words": "A pastor discusses how to turn a church from an inward focus to \nlooking out to the community and its needs.  His suggestions \nincluded: 1) Bring people face to face with the needs.  One pastor \n(without prior notice) asked the congregation one Sunday morning to \nboard chartered buses.  They drove through trailer parks, sprawling \nnew subdivisions, apartment complexes, stately old neighborhoods and \nstudent housing. Tour guides and a prepared script helped the members \nget a glimpse of the outside world. 2) Highlight ministry, not \nmanagers.  Too often we take our most committed people and make them \nrear-echelon bureaucrats instead of front-line officers.  3) Give \neveryone permission to minister. All programs and ideas don't have to \ncome from the pastor.  The author has only four guidelines a ministry \nmust meet: A. Don't ask for money.  B. You, not my staff, must run \nthe ministry. C. Stay out of morally questionable areas.  D. Stay out \nof doctrinal disputes.  4) Don't train people too soon. It's best to \ntrain people who have already gotten involved.  5) Emphasize \nflexibility over buildings.  6) Be patient.  \"Stay close to the Head \nand wait for him to release the body in ministry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Giving an ingrown church an outward focus\" by Frank Tillapaugh. \nLeadership, Summer 1988.

    "words": "(For those who aren't familiar with the story of George Washington \nand the\u0014\ncherry tree, let me give you the 30 second version.\u0014\n\u0014\n George Washington, the first President of the United States, was \nknown for his truthfulness, even as a child. The story tells that \nyoung George chopped down a cherry tree and when his father asked him \nabout it, he told his father the truth. George was not punished \nbecause of his truthfulness. You can figure out the moral of the \nstory.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, imagine if this happened in today's world .....)\u0014\n\"George Washington, did YOU chop down the cherry tree?\"\u0014\n\"No, Dad.\"\u0014\n\"I think you are lying.\"\u0014\n\"No, no, no!  I swear I did NOT chop down the cherry tree.\"\u0014\n\"Son, I saw you out here with your axe.  Your punishment will be much \nworse for you if you lie. Now, tell me the truth!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dad, I answered your question truthfully. Still, I must take complete\u0014\nresponsibility for all my actions.  While my answer was legally \naccurate,\u0014\nI did not volunteer information.\u0014\n\"Indeed, Dad, I did cause the cherry tree to be lying on the ground.  \nTo do\u0014\nthis was wrong.  It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a \npersonal\u0014\nfailure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.\u0014\n\"I know my answer to you gave a false impression.  I misled you, my \nown\u0014\nfather. I deeply regret that.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors.  First, by a \ndesire  to\u0014\nprotect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct.\u0014\n\"I was also very concerned about protecting Mom from this shock.\u0014\n\"What I did, Dad, was use a saw to cause the cherry tree to fall.  \nOnly after\u0014\nthe tree was already down did I go get my axe to chop off individual\u0014\nbranches.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So, I chopped off branches, but sawed down the tree.  Look at the \nsaw cut on the stump and the axe cuts on the branches.   Therefore, \nlegally, I told\u0014\nthe truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of this fallen tree and to \nreturn\u0014\nour attention to a solid family relationship.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(Sound familiar?)\u0014",

    "title": "GOD DIDN'T CREATE COMMITTEES",
    "words": "Ever see the bumper sticker that reads For God so loved the world \nthat he didn't create a committee.? Well, here's why:\u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis, Chapter 1, Release 3.0\u0014\n\u0014\nby: Ian P. Mitchell, University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada)\u0014\n\u0014\nIf God were process oriented, the Book of Genesis would mad\u0014\nsomething like this:\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth \nwas without form and void, so God created a small committee. He \ncaretlly balanced the committee vs-a-vs race, gender, ethnic origin \nand economic status in order to interface pluralism with the holistic \nconcept of self-determination according to adjudicatory guidelines. \nEven God was impressed, and so ended the first day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd God said, Let the committee draw up a mission statement. And\u0014\nbehold, the committee decided to prioritize and strategize and God\u0014\ncalled that pmcess empowerment. And God thought it sounded pretty\u0014\ngood. And evening and morning were the second day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd God said, Let the committee determine goals and objectives and \nengage in long term planning. Unfortunately, a debate about the \nsemantic differences between goals and objectives preempted almost \nall of the third day. Although the question was never satisfactorily \nresolved, God thought the process was constructive. And evening and \nmorning were the third day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd God said, Let them be a retreat in which the committee can \nenvision tinctional organization and engage in planning by \nobjectives. The committee considered adjustment of priorities and \nconsequential alternatives to program directions, and God saw that \nthis was good. And God thought that it was even worth all of the \ncoffee and doughnuts that he had to supply. And so ended the fourth \nday.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd God said, Let the committee be implemented with long range \nplanning and strategy. The committee considered guidelines and \nlinkages and structural sensitivities, and alternatives and \nimplemental models. And God saw that this was very democratic. And so \nwould have ended the fifth day, except for the unintentional renewal \nof the debate about the difirences between goals and objectives.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the sixth day, the committee agreed on criteria for adjudicatory \nassessment and evaluation. This wasn't the agenda that God had \nplanned. He wasn't able to attend however, because he had to take the \nafternoon off to create day and night and heaven and earth and seas \nand plants and stars and trees and seasons and years and sun and moon \nand birds and fish and animals and human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the seventh day, God rested and the committee submitted its \nrecommendations. It turned out that the recommended forms for things \nwere nearly identical to the way that God had created them; so the \ncommittee passed a resolution commending God for his implementation \naccording to the guidelines. Them was, however, some opinion \nexpressed that people should have been created in the committees \nimage.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the committee.\u0014",

    "title": "GRANT'S IGNOBLE ACT; GENERAL ORDERS NO. 11",
    "words": "By Stephen D. Lutz \u0014\n\u0014\n           Plagued by profiteering, speculating black-marketers and \nan importunate\u0014\n            father, a frustrated Ulysses S. Grant issued an order \nthat called for the\u0014\n              forcible removal of all Jewish residents from the \nDepartment of the\u0014\n                Tennessee. Abraham Lincoln himself was forced to \nintervene. \u0014\n\u0014\n           In mid-December 1862 Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant \nwas a harried man. His\u0014\n           ambitious plan to capture the vital Confederate river port \nof Vicksburg, Mississippi, by     an overland campaign had become \nbogged down in the state's hilly northern reaches. A\u0014\n           scheming political general, John A. McClernand, had traded \non his friendship with\u0014\n           Abraham Lincoln to raise a rival army-within-an-army and \nwas threatening Grant's\u0014\n           tenuous hold on command of the Department of the \nTennessee. Confederate cavalry\u0014\n           leaders Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Major \nGeneral Earl Van Dorn\u0014\n           were raiding with impunity behind Grant's lines. And, to \ntop it off, the general's flinty,\u0014\n           avaricious father had just arrived in camp demanding \nspecial treatment for himself and\u0014\n           some newfound business partners who were eager to make a \nprofit on the war. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Those partners, three Jewish brothers from Cincinnati, \nwould soon feel the full lash of\u0014\n           Grant's frustration in the form of an order that would \nbring Grant into conflict with the\u0014\n           White House, the War Department and some of his own \nofficers. His actions would       come  back to haunt him when he ran \nfor president in 1868. \u0014\n\u0014\n           The order, formally headed \"General Orders, No. 11,\" was \nso overtly biased, ham-fisted\u0014\n           and Draconian that even in the less-than-enlightened 1860s \nit stood out as a prime\u0014\n           example of religious and racial prejudice aimed at a \nfamiliar scapegoat--the Jews.\u0014\n           Although it was unusually harsh, Grant's order in reality \nwas merely the latest in a string of\u0014\n           directives that the typically phlegmatic general had \nissued that fall, all aimed at controlling\u0014\n           the endemic trading, speculating and outright smuggling \nthat plagued Union armies\u0014\n           throughout the South. \u0014\n\u0014\n           General Orders, No. 11, was drawn up by Grant's chief of \nstaff, Brig. Gen. John A.\u0014\n           Rawlins. Issued on December 17, 1862, it read in full: \n\"The Jews, as a class violating\u0014\n           every regulation of trade established by the Treasury \nDepartment and also department [of\u0014\n           the Tennessee] orders, are hereby expelled from the \ndepartment within twenty-four hours  from the receipt of this order. \u0014\n\u0014\n           \"Post commanders will see that all of this class of people \nbe furnished passes and required\u0014\n           to leave, and any one returning after such notification \nwill be arrested and held in\u0014\n           confinement until an opportunity occurs of sending them \nout as prisoners, unless furnished\u0014\n           with permit from headquarters. \u0014\n\u0014\n           \"No passes will be given these people to visit \nheadquarters for the purpose of making\u0014\n           personal application for trade permits.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           The sweeping document was signed: \"By order of Maj. Gen. \nU.S. Grant.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Ironically, at the very time General Grant was issuing the \norder that banned Jews from\u0014\n           visiting headquarters to apply for trade permits, Grant's \nown father was bedding down in\u0014\n           a tent beside his son's, with plans to lobby for just such \na trade permit. The irony,\u0014\n           perhaps, did not escape Grant. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Grant's command, the Department of the Tennessee, included \nall of Tennessee west of the\u0014\n           Tennessee River, the northern portion of Mississippi and a \nsegment of Arkansas\u0014\n           bordering the Mississippi River. This was prime \ncotton-growing country, and cotton--not\u0014\n           Jews--was the real problem that Grant and other Union \ndepartmental commanders faced. The Confederate embargo on cotton, \ndesigned to pressure Europeans into supporting the new Southern \ngovernment, had so increased the value of cotton that some planters \ngrew\u0014\nthe crop specifically to sell to smugglers, who slipped it through \nConfederate lines on the\u0014\nway to the cotton-starved textile mills of the Northeast and Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n           The price of the crop rose dramatically from 10 cents a \npound in December 1860 to 68\u0014\n           cents a pound only two years later. The cost of other \ngoods became inflated as well,\u0014\n           including military equipment, medical supplies, medicine, \nfoodstuffs and dry goods. Huge profits from the sale of cotton \nattracted profiteers and speculators from all regions of the country. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Writing to his sister, Mary, Grant said that beside all \nhis other concerns \"is added that of\u0014\n           speculators whose patriotism is measured in dollars and \ncents. Country has no meaning to them.\" Sharing in these sentiments, \nfellow general William Tecumseh Sherman also bitterly complained: \"If \nwe provide our enemies with enough money we enable them to buy all \nthey stand in need of. Money is as much a contraband as powder.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Profiteers came from all backgrounds. Rear Admiral David \nDixon Porter said of wartime\u0014\n           speculators as a whole, \"A greater pack of knaves never \nwent unhung.\" Ironically,\u0014\n           Porter's own ships regularly carried illegal contraband, \nespecially cotton, along the rivers\u0014\n           under Federal control. By the end of the war, the U.S. \nNavy would stand accused of\u0014\n           trafficking more than $100 million worth of illegal \nmerchandise. \u0014\n\u0014\n           The Army was not immune to graft, either. As soldiers \nintercepted contraband, millions of\u0014\n           dollars in cash and goods disappeared. Grant admitted to \nSecretary of the Treasury\u0014\n           Salmon P. Chase that at least one-third of his army was \ndistracted by such illicit activities.\u0014\n           As late as 1864 Lincoln himself fretted that numerous Army \nofficers \"are believed to\u0014\n           connive and share in the profits, and thus the Army itself \nis diverted from fighting Rebels to\u0014\n           speculating cotton.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           The Federal government itself had unwittingly contributed \nto the problem of profiteering\u0014\n           by directing the Army to seize and resell any cotton \ncaptured in the Southern states. This\u0014\n           had the predictable effect of encouraging reluctant \ncotton-growers to trade their product\u0014\n           to unscrupulous agents who slipped through military lines \nwith gold, weapons or medicine.\u0014\n           Lincoln had encouraged open trading with Southern areas \nnewly under Union control--a\u0014\n           political-economic strategy intended to win the loyalties \nof these recently \"liberated\" areas.\u0014\n           Such loyalty, however, was always subject to buyout. \nIllegal speculating flourished side by\u0014\n           side with government-sanctioned trade. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Vague and incessant policy changes to regulate the \nfeverish trading inevitably contradicted\u0014\n           each other. The civilian administrators of the Treasury \nand War departments attempted to\u0014\n           follow the policies of Lincoln, but on occasion each \nissued their own dictates as well. A\u0014\n           reconciliation between the various orders was nearly \nimpossible to achieve. Ultimately, the\u0014\n           Army was the primary authority in issuing trading permits. \nThus it was up to the Army to\u0014\n           police the trading and deal with the civilian violations \nthat frequently followed. \u0014\n\u0014\n           The complicated procedure of legally acquiring a trade \npermit started with a merchant's\u0014\n           finding a customer for specific goods. A list of goods to \nbe purchased would be handed\u0014\n           over to the merchant, along with a copy of the customer's \noath of allegiance to the Union.\u0014\n           The merchant would then take a duplicate set of bills to \nthe Board of Trade for approval.\u0014\n           The next office received a copy of the bill, a trade \npermit would be issued and then the\u0014\n           papers would be returned to the previous office for \napproval. The final stop would be the\u0014\n           office of the Army Provost Marshal for approval of all \ndocuments. The usual cost was\u0014\n           around $100. An alternate approach, which was considerably \nmore expedient, was to\u0014\n           spend $500 and illegally obtain a permit to gain access \ninto otherwise restricted areas. \u0014\n\u0014\n           A speculator from Oxford, Miss., once arranged to pay \n$12,000 for 1,500 bales of\u0014\n           cotton, or $8 per bale. Upon arriving in Columbus, Ky., he \ncould sell the same cotton for\u0014\n           an amount exceeding $500,000--more than $300 per bale. To \nmake the initial purchase,\u0014\n           however, he needed a trade permit. Since Grant's \nheadquarters was in Oxford at that\u0014\n           time, the trader took the opportunity to approach Grant \nhimself. The speculator offered a\u0014\n           deal: If Grant would provide a permit, he would receive a \nshare of the profits. Flatly\u0014\n           refusing, Grant told the trader that if any of his \nmerchandise was found in Union lines it\u0014\n           would be confiscated for government sale or use. \u0014\n\u0014\n           J. Russell Jones, an Illinois acquaintance who came to \nvisit Grant at his Holly Springs,\u0014\n           Miss., headquarters, also ventured into the cotton trade. \nUnknown to Grant, Russell\u0014\n           wrote to another Illinois acquaintance, Republican \nCongressman Elihu B. Washburne,\u0014\n           informing him that if he could get into Arkansas during \nhis trip he could make \"all the\u0014\n           money one man ought to have in ten days.\" Upon his return \nto Chicago, Jones unhappily\u0014\n           reported to Washburne that he had made no more than \n$25,000. Although there is no\u0014\n           evidence that Grant ever had any knowledge of the letters \nor transactions, he was\u0014\n           certainly aware that he was surrounded by such schemers. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Memphis came under Federal control on June 6, 1862, and \nLincoln immediately granted\u0014\n           special trade privileges to the city. By March 1863 the \nNew York Herald claimed that\u0014\n           $12 million in currency and goods had landed in \nConfederate coffers within the eight\u0014\n           months. Illegal trade in the city would eventually \ncontribute $30 million to the Confederate\u0014\n           cause. Speculation became so rampant that Lincoln revoked \nthe favored status, calling\u0014\n           Memphis a city \"still in rebellion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Despite all their efforts, Grant and Sherman could not \ncurtail the illegal trade. Sherman\u0014\n           remarked that it was \"worse than any [military] defeat.\" \nGrant referred to traders as \"more\u0014\n           dangerous than the shrewdest spy.\" Both generals attempted \nto stop the use of gold and\u0014\n           silver as an exchange and suggested that only U.S. \nTreasury notes or individual state\u0014\n           currencies be accepted. Lincoln overruled their actions, \nfeeling that they would hinder his\u0014\n           free trade plans and his attempts to keep newly occupied \nareas under Union control. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Amid the swirl of official and unofficial trading, the \nmost readily identifiable culprits were\u0014\n           Jewish speculators. Army officers in the affected areas \ncomplained frequently of \"Jew\u0014\n           traders\" who were illegally trafficking in cotton, \nswapping gold or silver for the crop. A\u0014\n           subsequent investigation into cotton-buying in the \nMississippi Valley turned up hundreds\u0014\n           of guilty soldiers and civilians--but only four Jewish \noffenders. Nevertheless, because they\u0014\n           were an easily recognizable ethnic group in the area, they \nwere singled out for\u0014\n           disproportionate blame. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Even an officer as comparatively well educated as Grant \nwas not immune to such ethnic\u0014\n           and religious prejudices. Indeed, before the war, Grant \nhad briefly flirted with joining the\u0014\n           Know-Nothing Party, a political organization of white \nAnglo-Saxon Protestants virulently\u0014\n           opposed to \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nof all other races, cultures and religions. Having lost out to a\u0014\n           German immigrant in his efforts to be appointed county \nengineer in St. Louis, Grant\u0014\n           attended one meeting of the local Know-Nothing lodge \nbefore thinking better of it. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Such animosities die hard, however. As Grant's \nfrustrations with speculators at the front\u0014\n           grew, he took them out on an easily recognized group. On \nJuly 26, 1862, Grant\u0014\n           telegraphed a subordinate in Columbus, Ky.: \"Examine the \nbaggage of all speculators\u0014\n           coming South, and, when they have species, turn them \nback....Jews should receive special\u0014\n           attention.\" Additionally, about a month before his \nnotorious order, Grant directed a\u0014\n           communiqu to Maj. Gen. Stephen A. Hurlbut at Jackson, \nTenn., on November 9, 1862.\u0014\n           Grant ordered: \"Refuse all permits to come south for the \npresent. The Israelites especially\u0014\n           should be kept out.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           The next day, Grant issued another communiqu. This one \nalso went to Jackson, but it\u0014\n           was directed to Brig. Gen. J.D. Webster, who had authority \nover the military railroads.\u0014\n           \"Give orders to all conductors on the road that no Jews \nare to be permitted to travel on\u0014\n           the railroad southward from any point,\" Grant dictated. \n\"They may go north and be\u0014\n           encouraged in it; but they are such an intolerable \nnuisance the Department must be purged\u0014\n           of them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           On December 13, 1862, Grant received an unwelcome visitor \nat Holly Springs--his\u0014\n           father, Jesse Root Grant. In the period between the \nMexican War and the Civil War,\u0014\n           Jesse Grant had shown little interest in his son. Their \nrelationship was often strained. Not\u0014\n           until the younger Grant gained glory and recognition did \nhis father take renewed notice of\u0014\n           his son. In the son's eyes, his father was often a \nspectacle and a burden. The younger\u0014\n           Grant viewed speculators as a detriment to the Union's war \nef-fort, and his father was a\u0014\n           known speculator. Grant continually rebuked his father for \nhis behavior. Aside from his\u0014\n           shady business schemes, Jesse was known to keep company \nwith people of ill repute,\u0014\n           including gamblers, swindlers and prostitutes. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Jesse Grant had just arrived from Cincinnati in the \ncompany of three new business\u0014\n           partners--Henry, Harmon and Simon Mack, the proprietors of \nMack and Brothers,\u0014\n           Merchants. Among the four, an arrangement had been made. \nTogether they would travel\u0014\n           south to Mississippi and purchase cotton throughout the \narea. The Macks agreed to pay\u0014\n           all of Jesse Grant's expenses and sell the cotton back up \nNorth, where profits would be\u0014\n           divided among the four. Jesse was to provide a single \nnecessary item: the complicity of his\u0014\n           major-general son, who could obtain for the Macks a trade \npermit. \u0014\n\u0014\n           At the time of his father's visit, Grant was occupied with \npressing military matters.\u0014\n           Sherman was preparing to move his army out of Memphis, and \narrangements needed to\u0014\n           be made with Admiral Porter's gunboats. General Grant was \nonly mildly receptive to his\u0014\n           father when he arrived. Upon discovering Jesse's real \npurpose for visiting, Grant became\u0014\n           enraged and embittered. The Mack brothers were immediately \nput onto the first\u0014\n           northbound train under guard. Although Jesse was no less \nculpable than his associates, he\u0014\n           was allowed to linger in camp until January 5. It was \nshortly after the Mack brothers\u0014\n           departed that Grant issued General Orders, No. 11. \u0014\n\u0014\n           After issuing his order on December 17, Grant sent a \nmessage to Assistant Secretary of\u0014\n           War Christopher P. Wolcott. In it, Grant explained his \naction by citing ongoing \"specie\u0014\n           regulation\" violations. Such violations, he said, were \ncommitted \"mostly by Jews and other\u0014\n           unprincipled traders.\" He often expelled them, he said, \nbut they kept returning. To Grant,\u0014\n           it seemed that Jews were \"a privileged class that can \ntravel anywhere.\" He suggested that\u0014\n           the government buy all cotton at a fixed rate and \ntransport it to a Northern destination for\u0014\n           sale. Such an action would help rid the department of \"all \ntraders. They are a curse to the\u0014\n           Army.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Grant's order was received with some confusion by his \nofficers. Several asked whether\u0014\n           the order applied to duly licensed Jewish sutlers who \nlegally sold goods to Union\u0014\n           regiments. Apparently it did. One Jewish officer, Captain \nPhilip Trounstine of the 5th Ohio\u0014\n           Cavalry, resigned his commission in protest, explaining \nthat he was \"either fortunately or\u0014\n           unfortunately born of Jewish parents\" and that he could \n\"no longer bear the taunts and\u0014\n           malice of those to whom my religious opinions are known.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Other officers were not so troubled by the ruling, and \nGrant's order was rapidly enforced.\u0014\n           At Paducah, Ky., 30 Jewish families were removed. That \nremoval affected 11 businesses\u0014\n           and shops. At least two of those removed were Union Army \nveterans. In one incident,\u0014\n           Jews were so rushed as they were being forced onto a \nriverboat departing for Cincinnati\u0014\n           that someone threw a baby, almost forgotten in the wake of \nconfusion from the general's order, aboard the vessel just before the \nvessel sailed. More than 1,000 Jews were\u0014\n           forcibly removed from Memphis, many having first had their \npersonal possessions\u0014\n           confiscated. Only two elderly Jewish women were left \nbehind in the care of Christian\u0014\n           neighbors. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Accounts of the army's actions made it into the pages of \nThe New York Times on\u0014\n           January 3, 1863, as well as newspapers across the world, \nincluding publications in\u0014\n           Turkey, Russia, England, Morocco and France. Jewish \nresidents of the affected area\u0014\n           prepared affidavits to send to government officials \nswearing that they had never engaged\u0014\n           in illegal speculation. Included were copies of their \nUnion oaths of allegiance as well as\u0014\n           supporting statements from non-Jewish neighbors. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Upon their forced departure, three men, one with his \nfiance, demanded to know the\u0014\n           cause of their detention. The Union colonel in charge \nresponded curtly, \"I do not feel\u0014\n           inclined to give any--in about half an hour you will leave \nfor Cairo and Alton.\" After\u0014\n           landing in Cairo, Ill., the four finally received their \nlong-awaited answer: \"Because you are\u0014\n           Jews, and are neither a benefit to the Union or \nConfederacy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           A group of Chicago businessmen were removed from Holly \nSprings, Miss. They were\u0014\n           sent to Memphis, a journey of nearly 80 miles. When they \nwere denied rail passage they\u0014\n           were forced to travel the distance on foot. Not \nunderstanding that they were being\u0014\n           removed only because they were Jewish, one attempted to \ntelegraph Grant in Holly\u0014\n           Springs upon arrival in Memphis for an explanation. For \nthat, the men were thrown in jail. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Jews looked upon Grant's order as a blatant violation of \ntheir constitutional rights--an\u0014\n           issue of their history and heritage. Starting from the \nareas most affected by the order and\u0014\n           quickly pouring in from across the nation, telegrams \nexpressing outrage arrived in\u0014\n           Washington, D.C., from non-Jewish as well as Jewish \ncitizens. Petitions arrived with\u0014\n           thousands of signatures, many of them signed by gentiles. \nSome were addressed to\u0014\n           Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, and others went directly \nto General-in-Chief Henry W.\u0014\n           Halleck. Of the hundreds of letters Grant received \npersonally, he answered none. His\u0014\n           assistant, John A. Rawlins, wrote on Grant's behalf and \ndownplayed Grant's\u0014\n           responsibility. Those letters condemning Grant's order \nthat were addressed directly to\u0014\n           Lincoln may have been intercepted without the president's \nknowledge. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Response in the press was divided. Some called General \nOrders, No. 11, the best order\u0014\n           ever issued. Others protested. Split judgments also came \nfrom elected representatives.\u0014\n           Republicans generally shared Grant's opinion, claiming \nthat Jews had never actually\u0014\n           supported the war effort. Democrats saw the issue as a \npurely ideological clash with their\u0014\n           Republican opponents, especially over repressed \nconstitutional rights under Lincoln's\u0014\n           regime. When the issue reached Congress, Republicans \nmanaged to stall debate. \u0014\n\u0014\n           By early January 1863, the order could no longer be \nignored. Jewish spokesman Cesar\u0014\n           Kaskel had composed a telegram to the president dated \nDecember 29, 1862. When by\u0014\n           early January no response was received from the commander \nin chief, Kaskel decided to\u0014\n           deliver the message in person. Upon his arrival in \nWashington, Kaskel conferred with\u0014\n           many Jewish and non-Jewish leaders, including \nRepresentative John Addison Gurley of\u0014\n           Ohio, who secured for him an audience with the president. \nWhen he appeared before\u0014\n           Lincoln, Kaskel had been intensively coached for the \nmeeting. After the two spoke for a\u0014\n           few minutes, it became evident that the president had no \ndirect knowledge of the situation\u0014\n           at hand. Kaskel presented the president with a copy of \nGrant's original order, along with\u0014\n           letters, petitions and affidavits. \u0014\n\u0014\n           After reading the documents in his usual careful, \nthoughtful manner, Lincoln asked, \"And\u0014\n           so the children of Israel were driven from the happy land \nof Canaan?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           \"Yes. And that is why we have come unto Father Abraham's \nbosom, asking protection,\"\u0014\n           Kaskel replied. \u0014\n\u0014\n           \"And this protection they shall have at once,\" Lincoln \ndeclared. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Lincoln sent an immediate directive to Halleck to revoke \nGeneral Orders, No. 11.\u0014\n           Halleck, in turn, wrote to Grant in Holly Springs. \"A \npaper purporting to be General\u0014\n           Orders, No. 11, issued by you December 17, 1862, was \npresented here,\" Halleck said.\u0014\n           \"By its terms it expels all Jews from your department. If \nsuch an order has been issued, it\u0014\n           will be immediately revoked.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           On January 21, Halleck sent Grant another communiqu. In \nit, he explained why he had\u0014\n           revoked the order. \"It may be proper to give you some \nexplanation,\" Halleck wrote. \"The\u0014\n           President has no objection to your expelling traitors and \nJew peddlers, which, I suppose,\u0014\n           was the object of your order; but, as it in terms \nproscribed an entire religious class, some\u0014\n           of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it \nnecessary to revoke it.\"\u0014\n           Halleck's letter seemed nearly apologetic. After he \nreceived the message revoking his\u0014\n           order, it still took Grant three days to put it into \neffect. \u0014\n\u0014\n           One week prior to the issuance of General Orders, No. 11, \nColonel John V. Du Bois had\u0014\n           issued a similar order from Holly Springs. It read, \"All \ncotton speculators, Jews and other\u0014\n           vagrants having no honest means to support themselves \nexcept trading on the miseries of\u0014\n           the country will leave town within twenty-four hours.\" It \nwas made perfectly clear that if\u0014\n           they did not leave, the individuals would be forced to \nwork on military entrenchments.\u0014\n           When Grant learned of Du Bois' order, he immediately \nrevoked it. Du Bois fell into\u0014\n           disfavor. Within a week, even before Grant's own order \ncame out, Du Bois was\u0014\n           transferred to a cavalry outpost in New Mexico Territory. \nAlthough he had been under\u0014\n           serious consideration for a generalship, that promotion \nwould never arrive. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Did Du Bois unknowingly get ahead of Grant's plan to \neliminate the speculation problem\u0014\n           once and for all? By his own orders of November 9 and 10, \n1862, Grant had given a\u0014\n           clear indication of the direction in which he was headed. \nWhy then the rash reaction to Du\u0014\n           Bois? Why would Grant refuse to support actions he himself \nadvocated only days later? \u0014\n\u0014\n           The answer would seem to lie where much of Grant's \nconflicted personality began--with\u0014\n           the overbearing, loutish figure of his father. The timing \nof Grant's Jewish order and the\u0014\n           stated targets of his wrath suggest that the order was \naimed not so much at the Jews as at\u0014\n           Jesse Grant, who had appeared at his son's doorstep \ndemanding favors and special\u0014\n           treatment. If Grant could not kick his father out of camp, \nhe could and would kick out his\u0014\n           father's partners--who happened to be Jewish. \u0014\n\u0014\n           This interpretation is backed up by the recollections of \none of Grant's subordinates,\u0014\n           Colonel James Harrison Wilson. \"There was a mean nasty \nstreak in old Jesse Grant,\"\u0014\n           Wilson observed. \"He was close and greedy. He came down \ninto Tennessee with a Jew\u0014\n           trader that he wanted his son to help, and with whom he \nwas going to share the profits.\u0014\n           Grant refused to issue a permit and sent the Jew flying, \nprohibiting Jews from entering the\u0014\n           line.\" Wilson had the number wrong, but the sense right. \nThe general's relatives, said\u0014\n           Wilson, \"were always trying to use him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Once rescinded, the infamous General Orders, No. 11, might \nhave been forgotten had its\u0014\n           author not gone on to become the leading Union general of \nthe war and, in 1868,\u0014\n           candidate for president of the United States. During the \npresidential campaign, when\u0014\n           Democratic newspapers revived the issue as a way of \nencouraging Jewish voters to\u0014\n           switch allegiances and vote against the Republican \nnominee, Grant's defenders sought to\u0014\n           blame the order's genesis on someone--anyone--other than \nGrant himself. Various figures\u0014\n           were put forth as the actual progenitor of the order, \nincluding Grant's former chief of staff,\u0014\n           John A. Rawlins, General-in-Chief Henry Halleck, and \nHalleck's aide, Christopher\u0014\n           Wolcott. \u0014\n\u0014\n           But Grant himself, honest to a fault, put the lie to that \nsuggestion. In September 1868, in\u0014\n           response to a letter from his old friend Isaac Morris \nrequesting clarification of the\u0014\n           controversy, Grant placed the blame squarely where it \nbelonged--on himself. \"I do not\u0014\n           pretend to sustain the order,\" he wrote. \"At the time of \nits publication I was incensed by a\u0014\n           reprimand received from Washington for permitting acts \nwhich Jews within my lines were\u0014\n           engaged in. There were many other persons within my lines \nequally bad with the worst of\u0014\n           them, but the difference was that the Jews could pass with \nimpunity from one army to the\u0014\n           other, and gold in violation of order, was being smuggled \nthrough the lines....The order\u0014\n           was issued and sent without any reflection and without \nthinking of the Jews as a sect or\u0014\n           race to themselves, but simply as persons who had \nsuccessfully...violated an order, which\u0014\n           greatly inured to the help of the rebels....I have no \nprejudice against sect or race, but want\u0014\n           each individual to be judged by his own merit. General \nOrders, No. 11 does not sustain\u0014\n           that statement, I admit, but then I do not sustain that \norder. It never would have been\u0014\n           issued if it had not been telegraphed the moment it was \npenned and without reflection.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           With his infuriating father underfoot and a sea of other \ntroubles threatening to overwhelm\u0014\n           him, Grant had reacted rashly and angrily in December \n1862. The only enemies who were\u0014\n           clearly visible at that instant were those whose peculiar \ndress, manner and habits made\u0014\n           them stand out from the crowd. With their noticeable \naccents and long-standing\u0014\n           involvement with business and speculation, the Jewish \ntraders made a convenient target.\u0014\n           Meanwhile, most of the wartime speculators and \nprofiteers--including some soldiers from\u0014\n           Grant's own Department of the Tennessee--blended too well \ninto the environment to be\u0014\n           caught. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           Stephen D.

    "words": "During the American Civil War, a young man named Roswell McIntyre\u0014\n\u0014\nwas drafted into the New York Cavalry. The war was not going\u0014\n\u0014\nwell. Soldiers were needed so desperately, that he was sent into\u0014\n\u0014\nbattle with very little training. Roswell became frightened -- he\u0014\n\u0014\npanicked and ran. He was later court-martialed and condemned to\u0014\n\u0014\nbe shot for desertion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMcIntyre's mother appealed to President Lincoln. She pleaded that\u0014\n\u0014\nhe was young and inexperienced and he needed a second chance. The\u0014\n\u0014\ngenerals, however, urged the president to enforce discipline.\u0014\n\u0014\nExceptions, they asserted, would undermine the discipline of an\u0014\n\u0014\nalready beleaguered army.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln thought and prayed. Then he wrote a famous statement. \"I\u0014\n\u0014\nhave observed,\" he said, \"that it never does a boy much good to\u0014\n\u0014\nshoot him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote this letter in his own handwriting: \"This letter will\u0014\n\u0014\ncertify that Roswell McIntyre is to be readmitted into the New\u0014\n\u0014\nYork Cavalry. When he serves out his required enlistment, he will\u0014\n\u0014\nbe freed of any charges of desertion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThat faded letter, signed by the president, is on display in the\u0014\n\u0014\nLibrary of Congress. Beside it there is a note which reads, \"This\u0014\n\u0014\nletter was taken from the body of Roswell McIntyre, who died at\u0014\n\u0014\nthe battle of Little Five Forks, Virginia.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven another chance, McIntyre fought until the end. Most of our\u0014\n\u0014\ndecisions are of a different magnitude than Lincoln's, but he\u0014\n\u0014\nillustrates that there is always a time to try again. It never\u0014\n\u0014\ndoes a boy (or anybody else for that matter) much good to shoot\u0014\n\u0014\nhim. But you might be surprised at the power of forgiveness!\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\n   When a pastor named Michael was still in seminary, he took a \u0014\n   required course in \"clinical pastoral education.\" Each \u0014\n   seminarian was assigned to be a chaplain in a hospital or \u0014\n   other institution, and one night each week was on call for \u0014\n   emergencies. Late one night, the phone rang, and Michael was \u0014\n   called to Alexian Brothers Medical Center in the Chicago \u0014\n   suburbs. \u0014\n\u0014\n   A 16-year-old girl had been driving at night with friends, \u0014\n   and she had backed into a light pole. The pole had broken \u0014\n   off and then fallen forward, crashing down onto the car. A \u0014\n   12-year-old friend in the car had been severely injured; in \u0014\n   fact, she was brain dead when she arrived at the hospital. \u0014\n   Michael walked with the 12-year-old's family as they went \u0014\n   through the wrenching process of realizing the truth and \u0014\n   allowing the life support to be removed. \u0014\n\u0014\n   The following morning, Michael visited the hospital room of \u0014\n   the 16-year-old driver. Physically, she was recovering well, \u0014\n   but emotionally, she was distraught knowing that her actions \u0014\n   had killed her friend. \"I'm going to be like a daughter to \u0014\n   her parents,\" she told Michael. \"I'm going to go over to \u0014\n   their house every day and baby-sit for them. I'll wash \u0014\n   dishes for them every night. I'll go over there every week \u0014\n   and mow their lawn.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n   Michael gradually helped her realize the truth that no \u0014\n   matter what she did, she could never replace their daughter. \u0014\n   She could never do enough to make up for her actions. All \u0014\n   she could do was ask for forgiveness and hope that the \u0014\n   parents would find it in their hearts to forgive her. \u0014\n\u0014\n   The parents who lost their daughter, amazingly, did forgive \u0014\n   this girl. She was set free from trying to pay back a debt \u0014\n   she could never repay no matter what she did. \u0014\n\u0014\n   In our relationship to God, we have sinned so greatly that \u0014\n   nothing we do could ever make up for it. But there is a way \u0014\n   out: God is willing to forgive us.\u0014",

It was so bad we walked into one \u0014\n   village and everybody was dead. There is a stench of death \u0014\n   that gets into your hair, gets onto your skin, gets onto \u0014\n   your clothes, and you can't wash it off. \u0014\n\u0014\n   We saw this little boy. You could tell he had worms and was \u0014\n   malnourished; his stomach was protruding. When a child is \u0014\n   extremely malnourished, the hair turns a reddish color, and \u0014\n   the skin becomes crinkled as though he's 100 years old. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Our photographer had a grapefruit, which he gave to the boy. \u0014\n   The boy was so weak he didn't have the strength to hold the \u0014\n   grapefruit, so we cut it in half and gave it to him. He \u0014\n   picked it up, looked at us as if to say thanks, and began to \u0014\n   walk back towards his village. \u0014\n\u0014\n   We walked behind him in a way that he couldn't see us. When \u0014\n   he entered the village, there on the ground was a little boy \u0014\n   who I thought was dead. His eyes were completely glazed \u0014\n   over. It turned out that this was his younger brother. The \u0014\n   older brother kneeled down next to his younger brother, bit \u0014\n   off a piece of the grapefruit, and chewed it. Then he opened \u0014\n   up his younger brother's mouth, put the grapefruit in, and \u0014\n   worked his brother's jaw up and down. We learned that the \u0014\n   older brother had been doing that for the younger brother \u0014\n   for two weeks. \u0014\n\u0014\n   A couple days later the older brother died of malnutrition, \u0014\n   and the younger brother lived. I remember driving home that \u0014\n   night thinking, I wonder if this is what Jesus meant when he \u0014\n   said, \"There is no greater love than to lay down our life \u0014\n   for somebody else.\"\u0014",

After all, the \ngovernment's\u0014\nrole is the use of force. And in a fallen world it is needed. But \nLiddy\u0014\nseemed to mean more than this: force and a strong will for him were \nnot\u0014\nprovisional answers in a fallen world; they were the answer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of my colleagues on the faculty rose to timidly pose the \nquestion: \"But\u0014\nin our country, most peopleafter alldo base their ethics onlikethe\u0014\nteachings of Jesus...and\" (finally he got it out with a rush) \n\"this-doesn'\u0014\nt-sOund-much-like-the-teachings-of-jesus.\" He sat down.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiddy glared a moment, took in a breath, and bellowed: \"Yeahand look \nwhat\u0014\nhappened to Jesus!\" He flailed his arms outward, holding them as if \non the\u0014\ncrossbeam of a gibbet: \"They crucified him.\" To Liddy, the case was \nclosed.\u0014\nThe audience reacted, briefly, as if stunned, astonishedand then with\u0014\nthunderous applause. After all, Liddy only said out loud what \neveryone else\u0014\nhad already concluded: \"Failure, persecution and pain, instead of \nsuccess,\u0014\nappreciation and a good retirementthat's no way to end up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA.

Naaman had great\u0014\nstrength, the poise at a patriarch, the position of ranking noble in \nthe palace of Benhadad II. He was Syria's version of Lord Wellington. \nBut beneath his jeweled turban and silken robe he was a leper, white \nleprosy, never cured. But just an ordinary little girl, a captive \nmaid in Naaman's household, directed him to Elisha the prophet and \nNaaman was healed and lived to\u0014\nserve God well. On the traditional site of his house in Damascus, \nthere is, today, a leper hospital.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nIt was just an ordinary shepherd tending his flocks who saved a \nlittle baby which had been ordered killed by his grandfather... the \nlittle, baby grew up to be Cyrus the Great , the great founder of the \nPersian empire and liberator of a great people. It was Cyrus who \nfreed the Jews from Babylon, after many years of bondage, and \ndirected them to rebuild the great Temple. This was the true \nbeginning of Judaism as we know it today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are few places on the face of the earth who hate not heard the \nname of David Livingston, the man who heard Robert Moffat, the famous \nmissionary to Africa, say in London, I have seen in the morning sun, \nthe smoke of a thousand villages where no missionary has ever been. \nLivingstone went on to put the world in his debt as a medical \nmissionary and explorer. But we would have never hard his name had it \nnot been for the unnamed savages just ordinary peop1e who carried his \nsupplies--and even Livingstone himself - across the uncharted \ncontinent so he could do his work and change the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were just ordinary men, the Chinese coolies who worked long and \nsweated hard to build the great Burma Road over which missionaries \nnow stumble, feebly perhaps, with outstretched arms to God with the \nlost of a vast continent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was just an ordinary man, a SS teacher,  who won a shoe salesman \nto Christ, This shoe salesman, who was decidedly ordinary himself in \neveryway  except in his devotion to Christ,  was Dwight L. Moody who \nshook the world for Jesus in his day.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was just an ordinary woman-- we know of no special talents--who \nprayed everyday for her boys, John and Charles Wesley, that God would \nuse them.  They helped change the face of Europe and saved England \nfrom a fate similar to that of the French Revolution with their \nSpirit-led ministries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Just an ordinary family in North Carolina, concerned about the \nday to day problems of a dairy farm operation, but who loved God \nsupremely and considered parenthood their greatest contribution to \nHim, who raised up a Billy Graham who has reached the King on his \nthrone with one hand and the pauper in his hovel with the other and \ndrawn them together in Jesus Christ.\u0014\nYes, God needs ordinary people.\u0014",

We all watched the live pictures as the huge fire in the \nMarina\u0014\narea burned. A remote camera crew was there and we saw the firemen \nfighting\u0014\nthe fires. The scene I remember the most, however, was a group of \npeople\u0014\nstanding around just looking at the destruction and looking at the \nfire. All\u0014\nof a sudden a cop came up to the crowd and yelled out to them: What \nare you\u0014\npeople doing just standing there. You must get prepared immediately. \nGo home\u0014\nand fill your bathtubs up with water. Be prepared to live without city\u0014\nservices for 72 hours.

John's message was not told in soft monotones, but rather \nthere was\u0014\nan urgent screaming in his voice. Why are you people not getting \nready, he\u0014\nyelled to the Hebrews. Why are you just standing there. Don't you see \nthat\u0014\nyour time is running out on you. You need to be preparing the way. \nMaking\u0014\nthe path straight. Go and get ready.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat message may sound very strange to our modern ears, but the \nsimple truth\u0014\nis that is Jesus were standing here in the flesh this morning and we \nasked\u0014\nhim to give a list of the preachers who were most instrumental upon \nhim, he\u0014\nwould have listed the name of John the Baptist.

In the \ncourse of\u0014\nyour investigation did you discover that I have a widowed mother who \nhas no\u0014\nother means of support but me?\" No, they responded, they did not know \nthat.\u0014\n\"Did you know that I have a sister who was left by a drunken husband \nwith\u0014\nfive children and no means to provide for them?\" No, they said, we \ndid not\u0014\nknow that either. \"Well, sir, did you know also that I have a brother \nwho is\u0014\ncripple due to an automobile accident and can never work another day \nto\u0014\nsupport his wife and family?\" Embarrassingly, they responded, no sir, \nwe did\u0014\nnot know that either. \"Well,\" he thundered triumphantly, \"I've never \ngiven\u0014\nany of them a cent so why should I give anything to you?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLike that man, most of us never give till it hurts or helps. It is\u0014\ninteresting to me that people who tithe in the church never speak of \nit as\u0014\nhurting. Marilyn and I tithe and it has not made life painful for us \nin the\u0014\nleast. We started discussing some days ago what our pledge to the \nchurch for\u0014\nnext year would be and how we could increase it. That doesn't sound \nlike it\u0014\nhurts does it? It is the grudging giver, who is the one who always \nregisters\u0014\nthe complaint: At that church all they talk about is money.\" So lets \nget off\u0014\nof this notion of give till it hurts so that we affirm we give till it\u0014\nhelps.\u0014",

    "words": "Grim Legacy\u0014\n                     Va. eugenics policy led to sterilization \u0014\n\u0014\n                     BY BILL BASKERVILL\u0014\n                     ASSOCIATED PRESS\u0014\n\n                                                                                        \nFeb 06, 2001\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     LYNCHBURG, VA-- His state labeled him a \"mental \ndefective\" and surgically sterilized him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     His nation honored him as a war hero, awarding \nhim the Bronze Star for valor, the Purple Heart and the Prisoner of \nWar Medal for service in World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Now the Virginia House of Delegates has refused \nto apologize to Raymond W. Hudlow and the thousands of other \nVirginians, mostly teen-agers and young adults, who were sterilized \nunder the state's eugenics program. Instead, the House last week \nvoted to express its \"profound regret\" for the General Assembly's \naction 77 years ago that led to forced sterilizations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Does this man [Hudlow] deserve an apology, or \njust regrets?\" said Phil Theisen, president of the Lynchburg \nDepressive Disorders Association. Theisen is a leading advocate for a \nstate apology.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Virginia officials, acting under a eugenics law \nthat served as a model for the rest of the nation, tried to purify \nthe white race from 1924 to 1979 by targeting virtually any human \nshortcoming they believed was a hereditary disease that could be \nstamped out by surgical sterilization. Such maladies included mental \nillness, mental retardation, epilepsy, criminal behavior, alcoholism \nand  immorality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In 1941, Hudlow was a frightened 16-year-old who \nbecame caught up in Virginia's eugenics frenzy that led to the forced \nsterilization of about 7,500 people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     His crime: repeatedly running away from home to \navoid beatings by his father.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Every time my father beat me I ran away. He \nbeat me half to death,\" Hudlow said in a recent interview at his \nmobile home near Lynchburg.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When his father told the \"welfare lady\" that \"he \ncouldn't control me,\" Hudlow's reproductive fate was sealed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I was picked up by the sheriff at home. He \nhandcuffed me and took me\" to the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and \nFeebleminded near Lynchburg, where most of Virginia's sterilizations \nwere performed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     On June 17, 1942, Amherst County Circuit Judge \nEdward Meeks granted the colony's request to sterilize Hudlow, \nidentified in the court order as an \"inmate\" of the colony.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow, now 75, remembers the day the colony \neugenicists came for him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"They just came and got me before I woke up one \nmorning. They wheeled me and throwed me up on the operating table. \nThey put straps around my waist and chest, spread my legs and put my \nfeet in stirrups.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"There was a nurse holding my arms above my head \nso I wouldn't move.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"When they grabbed my testicles, they pinched \nthem up. They took a needle and stuck it into my testicles.\" Hudlow \nbelieves this was anesthesia.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"They didn't wait for it to work. They made an \nincision. They went right on in there. I was hollering and crying. I \nwas hurting.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     None of the colony medical staff explained what \nthey were doing to him, Hudlow said. \"The only way I found out, an \nemployee on Ward 7 told me I wouldn't be able to father any children.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"They treated us just like hogs, like we had no \nfeelings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow was released from the colony in October \n1943 and drafted into the Army two months later.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I went in at Omaha Beach in France in August \n1944,\" two months after the Allied invasion of Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow served as the radioman for his platoon \nleader. He saw combat in France, Belgium and Holland, where he was \nwounded in the left knee and captured by the Germans. He was in \nvarious prison camps for seven months until he was liberated by the \nRussians in May 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow decided to make the military a career, \nserving 21 years in the Army and Air Force.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow doesn't talk about his war service unless \nquestioned about it and did not mention his medals until asked if he \nwas awarded any. He keeps his medals, citations and military records \nin a footlocker in his bedroom closet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     He said he has had more flashbacks about the \nsterilization procedure than about the terror of combat and \nimprisonment by the Germans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I remember this just as it was yesterday. It \nhas always been in my mind. It has never left me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     He said his inability to have children \"worked \non my mind, especially when I was around my sisters and my brother. \nThey had children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hudlow said he might try to testify before a \nSenate committee when it takes up the eugenics resolution if he \ndoesn't have to walk too far at the state Capitol. He said his feet \nhave been hurting him a lot lately and he has a hard time getting \naround.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Eugenics eventually was discredited as political \nand social prejudice rather than scientific fact, but neither \nVirginia nor any of the 29 other states that conducted eugenical \nsterilizations has ever compensated, apologized or memorialized the \nmore than 60,000 eugenics victims.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Virginia's eugenics law, which was upheld by the \nU.S. Supreme Court in 1927, had a dramatic impact in Germany, where \nAdolf Hitler's 1933 Law for the Prevention of Offspring with \nHereditary Diseases contained language that echoed the Virginia \nstatute.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The 1927 Supreme Court ruling still stands as \nthe constitutional standard on involuntary sterilization, prompting a \nfederal judge in 1984 to throw out a class-action lawsuit filed by \nVirginia's eugenics victims.\u0014",

    "title": "GOD'S AVENGING SCOURGE",
    "words": "Nat Turner seemed to have imbibed deeply all the best elements of\u0014\n                      evangelical southern white religion. He did not \nuse tobacco or liquor, he\u0014\n                      seemed to live a perfectly disciplined life \namong men as well as women; by\u0014\n                      and large, he caused no real trouble for the \nkeepers of the status quo. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, around 1821 the young black man had \nvividly demonstrated to\u0014\n                      whites the exemplary advantage of his high \nstanding among the other\u0014\n                      Africans by returning voluntarily to Samuel \nTurner after having run away for\u0014\n                      about 30 days. Therefore whites could never \nhave predicted that Nat would\u0014\n                      be possessed by a driving messianic mission to \nbecome God's avenging\u0014\n                      scourge against the slaveholders and their \nworld. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Blood on the corn\u0014\n                      We are not sure of all that Nat learned from \nhis immediate family, but his\u0014\n                      father taught him at least one thing: slavery \nwas not to be endured. While\u0014\n                      Nat was still a child, his father had joined \nthe ranks of the fugitives. From\u0014\n                      the rest of the community of captives, Nat \nlearned the same lesson. He\u0014\n                      knew of the injustices suffered by his \ncommunity. He learned its ritual songs\u0014\n                      and prayers, and the stories of heroes. But Nat \nclaimed that his most\u0014\n                      profound lessons came in his own lonely, \npersonal struggles with the spirit,\u0014\n                      whom he identified as \"the Spirit that spoke to \nthe prophets.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the time he was 25, Nat had wrestled many \ntimes in the night with the\u0014\n                      Spirit of his God, the God of his Fathers. He \nhad been pressed especially\u0014\n                      hard by the words: \"Seek ye first the Kingdom \nof God and all things shall be\u0014\n                      added unto you.\" As he attempted to plumb the \nmeaning and mystery of\u0014\n                      that promise, he had been driven into his own \nmonth-long experience of the\u0014\n                      wilderness, but then had returned to the Turner \nfarm. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Steadily he became more convinced that the \nKingdom he sought was not\u0014\n                      the one preached by most of the white men he \nhad heard. Instead, he saw\u0014\n                      the promised Kingdom of righteousness as one \nwhich would somehow be\u0014\n                      realized on the very farms and fields of \nVirginia, a Kingdom in which the\u0014\n                      power of the slave masters would be broken. \nWhat made the vision chilling\u0014\n                      and exhilarating was his vivid awareness of \nbeing a chosen instrument for\u0014\n                      the bringing in of this Kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, the way forward was not yet clear, and \nNat Turner went about his life\u0014\n                      and work, waiting. By this time Turner was a \nfamiliar figure in Southampton\u0014\n                      County and the surrounding areas. Of average \nheight, muscular in build,\u0014\n                      coffee-tan in complexion, with a wide nose and \nlarge eyes, he walked with\u0014\n                      a brisk and active movement among his people, \nmarked within himself and\u0014\n                      among them as a special man. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On Sundays and at midweek meetings, he exhorted \nand sang in black\u0014\n                      Baptist gatherings. At one point, word spread \nthat Nat Turner had cured a\u0014\n                      white man of some serious disease, and then had \nbaptized the white\u0014\n                      believer and himself in a river. Such a story \nonly added to his renown. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      None of these developments, none of this high \nregard, moved Turner from\u0014\n                      his central purpose and passionate search. He \nwaited and worked and\u0014\n                      married, but knew that all these things were \nonly a prelude. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       \"We do not go forth for the sake\u0014\n                       of blood and carnage. Ours is\u0014\n                       not a war for robbery, nor to\u0014\n                       satisfy our passions; it is a\u0014\n                       struggle for freedom.\". \u0014\n\u0014\n                                           Nat Turner\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                     Then in 1825 a \nclearer vision came: \"I\u0014\n                                                     saw white \nspirits and black spirits\u0014\n                                                     engaged in \nbattle, and the sun was\u0014\n                                                     darkenedthe \nthunder rolled in the\u0014\n                                                     Heavens, and \nblood flowed in\u0014\n                                                     streamsand I \nheard a voice saying,\u0014\n                                                     'Such is your \nluck, such you are called\u0014\n                                                     to see, and let \nit come rough or\u0014\n                                                     smooth, you must \nsurely bear it.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                     Again, one day \nas he worked in the\u0014\n                                                     fields Nat \nclaimed to have\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"discovered drops of blood on the corn as \nthough it were dew from\u0014\n                      heaven.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the leaves of the trees, he said he found \n\"hieroglyphic characters, and\u0014\n                      numbers, with the forms of menportrayed in \nblood.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Through this African imagery the white and \nblack fighters had appeared\u0014\n                      again, but this time the meaning was even \nclearer in his mind. It signified to\u0014\n                      Nat that \"the blood of Christ had been shed on \nthis earthand was now\u0014\n                      returning to earth.\" Therefore, he said, \"It \nwas plain to me that the Savior\u0014\n                      was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for \nthe sins of men, and the\u0014\n                      great day of judgment was at hand.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the spring of 1828, the fullest description \nof the Kingdom he sought, and\u0014\n                      of his own role in its coming, were spoken to \nNat's third ear. On May 12,\u0014\n                      1828, Nat said, \"I heard a loud voice in the \nheavens, and the Spirit instantly\u0014\n                      appeared to me and said the Serpent was \nloosened, and Christ had laid\u0014\n                      down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, \nand that I should take it\u0014\n                      and fight against the serpent, for the time was \nfast approaching when the\u0014\n                      first should be last and the last should be \nfirst.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As if to clear away any lingering doubt he \nmight have had, Nat heard the\u0014\n                      spirit's clear instructions, that at the \nappearance of the proper sign \"I should\u0014\n                      arise and prepare myself, and slay my enemies \nwith their own weapons.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For 28 years Nat Turner had been nutured by the \nblack community,\u0014\n                      instructed by signs on the leaves and in the \nskies. But it may have been\u0014\n                      difficult to wait for the sign: about this \ntime, it seems, Turner was whipped\u0014\n                      by Thomas Moore, his present owner, \"for saying \nthat the blacks ought to\u0014\n                      be free, and that they would be free one day or \nanother.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Turner soon moved to a new home in the country, \non the farm of Joseph\u0014\n                      Travis near Barrow Road. So Nat did his \ntemporary work and bided his\u0014\n                      time, watching for the sign. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hatchets and axes\u0014\n                      The sign came in February 1831, with an eclipse \nof the sun. He told his\u0014\n                      closest comrades that the time of battle and \nblood was approaching. With\u0014\n                      him in the initial leadership cadre were four \nmen: Henry Porter, Hark Travis,\u0014\n                      Nelson Williams, and Samuel Francis. Evidently \nthere was a group of some\u0014\n                      25 who would form the core of the fighting \nforce at first, convinced that\u0014\n                      others would be recruited as the struggle was \nopenly joined. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Fourth of July, that prime symbol of white \nAmerican contradictions, was\u0014\n                      chosen as the date for the uprising. But as the \ntime approached, Nat\u0014\n                      became ill (were there fears or premonitions?) \nand the date was\u0014\n                      abandoned. Another sign had to be sought. On \nAugust 13, 1831, there was\u0014\n                      \"a day-long atmosphere phenomenon, during which \nthe sun appeared\u0014\n                      bluish-green,\" and Nat knew that he had found \nthe way again. One week\u0014\n                      later he met with Hark and Henry to agree on a \nfinal plan. The next night\u0014\n                      they met again, this time with several others; \nthey agreed on their work, and\u0014\n                      ate a final meal together. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       \"IT WAS PLAIN to me that the\u0014\n                       Savior was about to lay down the\u0014\n                       yoke he had borne for the sins of\u0014\n                       men, and the great day of judgment\u0014\n                       was at hand.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                             Nat Turner\u0014\n                                                       In the dark \nhours of the morning of\u0014\n                                                       August 22, Nat \nTurner's God\u0014\n                                                       pressed him \nforward at the head of\u0014\n                                                       his band of \nblack avenging angels,\u0014\n                                                       drove him in \nsearch of what seemed\u0014\n                                                       the ultimate \njustice: that \"the first\u0014\n                                                       should be last \nand the last should be\u0014\n                                                       first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      According to a black tradition, Nat's final \nwords to his followers were:\u0014\n                      \"Remember, we do not go forth for the sake of \nblood and carnage; but it is\u0014\n                      necessary that, in the commencement of this \nrevolution, all the whites we\u0014\n                      meet should die, until we have an army strong \nenough to carry out the war\u0014\n                      on a Christian basis. Remember that ours is not \na war for robbery, nor to\u0014\n                      satisfy our passions; it is a struggle for \nfreedom.\" Whatever the words, this\u0014\n                      was the goal. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They began at the Travis household with \nhatchets and axes, and no life was\u0014\n                      spared. At that point, with very few \nexceptions, all whites were the enemy. It\u0014\n                      was not a matter of \"good\" and \"bad\" masters; \nall were involved in slavery.\u0014\n                      And the children were the heirs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Temporarily filled with such resolve, organized \ninto rudimentary cavalry and\u0014\n                      infantry sections, Nat's men continued down the \nBarrow Road, storming\u0014\n                      house after house, destroying family after \nfamily: Francis, Reese, Turner,\u0014\n                      Peeples, Whitehead, each in its turn \nexperienced the terrible slaughter, not\u0014\n                      alien to the children of Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the height of the advance, there were \napparently some 60 men in Nat\u0014\n                      Turner's company, including several described \nas \"free.\" Together, in a\u0014\n                      breathlessly brief period of solidarity, they \nwere marching to Jerusalem,\u0014\n                      Virginia, and their leader was now \"General \nNat.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As time wore on that Monday, there was a \ngrowing sense of confusion,\u0014\n                      disarray, and sometimes drunkenness among some \nof Nat's men. Often\u0014\n                      the prophet himself seemed distracted, and rode \nat the rear of his troops\u0014\n                      rather than at the front. Added to these \ninternal problems was the tragic fact\u0014\n                      that General Nat's men \"had few arms among \nthemand scarcely one, if\u0014\n                      one, that was fit for use.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Before they reached the road to Jerusalem, the \nalarm had been spread,\u0014\n                      leaping like fire from one blanched and \ntrembling set of lips to another,\u0014\n                      echoing in the clashing sound of church bells \nacross the countryside. The\u0014\n                      alarm struck fear in the heart of some of \nTurner's band and they deserted.\u0014\n                      Others, still on plantations, decided that the \nstruggle was now hopeless,\u0014\n                      and decided to remain with their masters, \nbiding their time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nevertheless, Nat had already challenged \nVirginia, the government of the\u0014\n                      United States, and all the fierce and chilling \nfears that raged within the\u0014\n                      depths of the white community. So vigilante \ngroups, militia companies, and\u0014\n                      the military arm of the federal government were \nsoon on their way to the\u0014\n                      battleground. By noon on Monday, in the blazing \nheat of a cornfield,\u0014\n                      Turner's insurrectionaries had their first \nencounter with the white militia and\u0014\n                      the volunteer companies which had rushed to \norganize. The blacks were\u0014\n                      heavily outgunned and, after suffering \nsignificant casualties, were forced to\u0014\n                      retreat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, with less than a third of his army \nremaining, General Nat maintained\u0014\n                      his resolve to reach Jerusalem. But the path \nwas blocked each way he\u0014\n                      moved, fear was rising among his decimated \ncommand, and night was\u0014\n                      now upon them. So they hid and prayed, while \nisolated members of their\u0014\n                      company were being trapped, captured, and \nsometimes murdered in the\u0014\n                      woods. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the next day, Tuesday, August 23, the \ncountryside was swarming with\u0014\n                      hundreds of armed white men from surrounding \ncountries, cities, and\u0014\n                      military bases in Virginia and North Carolina, \nand Turner had fewer than 20\u0014\n                      rebels remaining. Even in the face of these \nodds, Nat and his men were\u0014\n                      determined to fight on, if only they could draw \nmore blacks to their side.\u0014\n                      Before daybreak they moved to attack a large \nplantation near their\u0014\n                      encampment, daring to hope they would attract \nfresh recruits out of the\u0014\n                      slave quarters there. Instead, Turner's \nfighters were repulsed by a\u0014\n                      defending force made up of the owners and their \nenslaved blacks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the beleaguered black remnant force \nseparated in desperate search for\u0014\n                      other possibly surviving companies, all save \nNat were killed or captured by\u0014\n                      the end of the day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That night he hid and hoped. As hundreds of men \nand animals searched\u0014\n                      him out, he dug a hole in the ground and lay \nthere, daring to nurture the\u0014\n                      dream that he might yet regroup his forces, \nrefusing to believe that the\u0014\n                      promised time of judgment for Virginia's slave \nholders had not come (or\u0014\n                      had arrived in some form unrecognizable to \nhim). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In spite of Turner's desperate hope, there was \nno regrouping for his troops.\u0014\n                      He remained in hiding, avoiding capture for six \nweeks after the attempted\u0014\n                      revolution. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Not guilty\"\u0014\n                      On October 30, 1831, Nat Turner was captured. \nHis sign had not come.\u0014\n                      Charged with \"conspiring to rebel and making \ninsurrection,\" he told his\u0014\n                      counsel that he wished to plead not guilty, \nbecause he \"did not feel\" that he\u0014\n                      was a guilty person. Guilt was not a relevant \ncategory for an instrument of\u0014\n                      divine judgmenteven if the last sign had not \ncome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nat Turner went to the gallows on November 11, \n1831, refusing to speak\u0014\n                      any final word to the crowd gathered to see him \ndie, knowing that it was his\u0014\n                      living which had been his last, best testimony. \nThen, in its quiet, secret\u0014\n                      ways, the black community of Virginia and of \nthe nation took his life into its\u0014\n                      own bosom and pondered it. They continued to \nsee signs, beginning with\u0014\n                      the day of his execution, for on that day, \naccording to black tradition, \"the\u0014\n                      sun was hidden behind angry clouds, the thunder \nrolled, the lightning\u0014\n                      flashed, and the most terrific storm visited \nthat county ever known.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Vincent Harding is on the faculty at Iliff \nSchool of Theology in Denver, Colorado.

In it, the authors argue that\u0014\n                      slave rebellions were nowhere near as \ninfrequent as previously thought. Slaves often\u0014\n                      rebelled, they say, and ran away at every \npossible opportunity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Civitas Anthology of African American Slave \nNarratives includes The Confessions of\u0014\n                      Nat Turner, the Leader of the Late Insurrection \nin Southhampton, VA (1831), as well as\u0014\n                      The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave \n(1831), The Narrative of the Life of\u0014\n                      Frederick Douglass, American Slave (1845), \nNarrative of William W.

Denmark Vesey, an African Methodist \nlay leader who bought his freedom in\u0014\n                      1799, planned a rebellion after reading Joshua \n6:21 and Zechariah 14:1-3. But the\u0014\n                      uprising, planned for July 14, 1822, was \nrevealed by fearful slaves. Of the 131 African\u0014\n                      Americans arrested in the plot, 35 were \nexecuted and 43 were deported. Vesey himself\u0014\n                      was hanged and his Charleston, South Carolina, \nchurch was closed until 1865. You can\u0014\n                      read an article Thomas Wentworth Higginson \nwrote about Denmark Vesey in the June\u0014\n                      1861 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, available \nonline. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Africans in America site also has a section \non the Denmark Vesey conspiracy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Image:\u0014\n                      When southern whites depicted Turner's \nrebellion, as in this woodcut, it quickly became\u0014\n                      propaganda.

    "title": "GLORIA IN EXCELSIS--HANDEL'S \"MESSIAH\"",
    "words": "Gloria in Excelsis Deo\u0014\nErich Bridges\u0014\n\u0014\nA woman who had never been out of communist China attended a \nperformance of Handel's Messiah on her first trip to the West. As the \nlast triumphant notes faded away, she turned to her hosts with a \nmixture of trembling exaltation and urgent curiosity. \"I must know,\" \nshe pleaded, apologizing for her inadequate English. \"Who were they \nsinging about?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWere he still alive, George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) would be \npleased to tell her. His immortal hymn of praise was beckoning \nanother seeker-among millions-toward the Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Handel is the greatest composer that ever lived,\" declared Ludwig \nvan Beethoven. \"I would uncover my head and kneel down on his tomb.\" \nLike Beethoven, Handel had a blistering temper and little patience \nfor fools. But he approached the creation of Messiah with reverence, \nhumility and holy passion. He composed the towering oratorio in just \n24 days, without emerging from his house and often without eating. A \nservant found him sobbing one day as he labored over the music. How \nmany have wept wjth joy over it since?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Whether I was in my body or out of my body as I wrote it I know not. \nGod knows,\" Handel later remarked. \"I did think I did see all Heaven \nbefore me and the great God Himself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClerical critics were scandalized when Handel dared to premiere \nMessiah in 1742 in a theater rather than a church, thereby \n\"prostituting sacred things.\" But people hungry for truth clothed in \ngreat beauty knew better and embraced Messiah as their own. When it \nwas performed in Westminster Abbey years later, Londoners nearly \nrioted to get in. King George was so moved when he first heard the \n\"Hallelujah Chorus\" that he spontaneously stood up-a tradition that \nlasts to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nMessiah originally was an Easter event rather than a Christmas one, \nfor it celebrates Christ's birth, death and most of all, His glorious \nrising. After conducting it for the last time in 1759, an ailing and \nnearly blind Handel acknowledged the ovation by saying, \"Not from \nme-but from Heaven-comes all.\" He expressed the desire to die on Good \nFriday, \"in the hope of rejoining the good God, my sweet Lord and \nSavior, on the day of His resurrection.\" He died on Holy Saturday.\u0014\n\u0014\nA nobleman once congratulated Handel for \"entertaining\" the masses \nwith Messiah. The maestro's reply: \"My Lord, I should be sorry if I \nonly entertained them; I wished to make them better.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the point of Messiah. Handel came not to bury the living \nSavior in a sparkling Christmas \"entertainment,\" but to praise Him. \nMessiah's joyous message cannot be silenced by polite applause or \ncontained inside the walls of sedate con- cert halls and sanctuaries. \nFor its text is the living Word of God. From its opening admonition, \n\"Comfort ye, my people. ...Prepare ye the way of the Lord\" (Isa. \n40:1,3) to its closing hymn of adoration, \"Worthy is the lamb that \nwas slain. ...Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto Him \nthat sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever\" \n(Rev. 5:12, 13 ), it is a song of love to the Lord of Hosts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it is with the great tradition of Western music, which began with \nplainsong chants of King David's psalms by ragged monks and reached \nthe heights of Handel, Bach and their successors. It is music com- \nposed to help humanity glorify God. Modern secularists admire the \nmusic but prefer to ignore the words-or ban them altogether, as in \nthe communist world. America may not be far behind. If we allow our \nown commissars to forbid a little girl attending camp to sing Kum Ba \nYah because it contains the word \"Lord\" (as happened recently), what \nwill we do with Messiah?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the living God will not be marginalized by those who seek to \nsilence Him- or wrap Him up in little boxes of \"entertainment.\" He \nwill be praised-by the very stones of the ground if necessary. But \nthe stones are not alone. A new generation of servants is following \nHim into the world to lift His name everywhere. And God is steadily \nraising up worshipers among the nations. They are writing their own \nhymns of praise-in their own lan- guages and forms-to lift Christ \namong their own peoples.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Worship is the fuel and goal of missions,\" declares John Piper. \"The \ngoal of missions is the gladness of the peoples in the greatness of \nGod. ...'Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise \nthee. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy\"' (Ps. 67: 3, 4a, \nKJV).\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel, the old master, would surely say, \"Amen!\"\u0014",

I lay where he \nis lying now, in the northeast corner of the room, and looked out the \nwindow at night to a red blinking light on a distant water tower and \nimagined living in New York City and other grand things, and now at \n87 he lies in the bed and imagines the risen Christ meeting him with \nopen arms, as in the hymns that his morning nurse Ramona sings to him.\u0014\n\u0014\n     She is a woman of great energy and compassion who brings her \nguitar and sings When I Survey the Wondrous Cross, Abide with Me and \nother old favorites, and the other morning she got him to smile by \nsinging When Johnny Comes Marching Home. Ramona is an angel.\u0014\n\u0014\n     My father has chronic pneumonia that many rounds of antibiotics \ncouldn't clear up. Twice in the past year, an ambulance had to be \ncalled to haul him to the hospital for suctioning procedures that he \nfound dreadful, and after talking it over with my mother, he decided \nhe wouldn't go down that road again. He was brought home and put on \nhospice care, and the decision was made to take him off antibiotics. \nThey simply weren't doing him any good. There were e-mail exchanges \nabout this decision, which seemed grave, and my mother and sister \nnotified the funeral home, and my brother began to plan the service, \nand Dad went off the antibiotics and got a little better. That was a \nfew weeks ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n     My father built this house he now lies in. He poured the \nconcrete and framed up both floors and hoisted the roof beam and \nshingled the roof and nailed the siding and the flooring and the \ninsulation and the drywall, and planted the apple orchard and the \nhalf-acre of vegetable garden to feed his six children.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Six children is about what you need if you're hoping to die at \nhome and not in a warehouse. My younger brothers and sister take \nturns on night duty, along with my niece, and of course my mother is \nthere, seeing to everything, administering the liquid nutrients and \nTylenol through a feeding tube, adjusting the oxygen. It is an \nup-and-down business. At various times, he has seemed to be at \ndeath's door, and distant family have flown in to say goodbye, and \nthen the other night, with my little girl standing at his bedside and \npoking him, he seemed ready to pick up his bed and walk. \" All I do \nis nap all day,\" he said to me. \"They keeping you pretty busy?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     The handbook on dying that the hospice gave us advises you to \nforgive the dying person and express your love and your gratitude, \nand to say goodbye. It doesn't explain how to do this with someone \nwho is extremely hard of hearing and who, even when he could hear, \nnever went in for such declarations. And what about all those things \nyou're not sure whether to forgive or feel grateful for?\u0014\n\u0014\n    When I was 18, he told me he wouldn't pay a penny for my college \neducation, and so I worked my way through school and thereby got the \ngift of independence, an inestimable gift. But I stand in the doorway \nand look at him, asleep, and I am afraid of him. He is still my dad, \nand his power is greater than that of the New York Times.\u0014\n\u0014\n     I remember when my Grandma Keillor lay dying in a little \nhospital in Onamia, tended by her daughters, and my father and his \nbrothers came to bid farewell to her. They drew up their chairs to \nthe foot of the bed where she lay unconscious, and they were very \nstill and solemn for a while, but in due course they got to talking \nabout cars. It struck me at the time as callous--1 was 20 and a \npoet--to sit by your dying mother and discuss a particular \nlow-mileage Ford station wagon you'd seen on a used-car lot in Anoka, \nand now it seems like the most natural thing in the world. Life goes \non. Your mother is dying, but a man needs wheels.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The best gift I can give my father is to bring my daughter to \nvisit him. She touches his foot, and he wriggles his toes. She throws \na ball at him; he throws it back. She smiles a beatific smile. She \nkisses his hand and his cheek. She waves bye-bye. She has no words \nfor this. It is pure love.\u0014\n\u0014\n     She is three, the age I was when he wrote a letter to me and my \nbrother and sister in 1945 from New York, saying how much he missed \nus while he was in the Army, billeted in a hotel at Broadway and \n29th. He thought about us every day, he said, and wished we could be \nwith him but didn't think it wise for children to grow up in a city \namong so many people. It was signed, \"Love, Daddy.\" I never saw the \nletter until a week ago. It never occurred to me that he loved me, \nbut of course he did, and it was nice to hear about it at last. \u0014\n\u0014\nTime Magazine, March 12, 200\u0014",

T. Wright\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On Palm Sunday 1996 the London Sunday Times ran \na\u0014\n                      feature about the tomb of Jesus, suggesting \nthat a new\u0014\n                      discovery threatened the basis of Christianity. \nTwo BBC\u0014\n                      producers went looking for fresh material for \nan Easter\u0014\n                      Sunday program. They wanted to stimulate \ndiscussion on the\u0014\n                      nature of the Resurrection. Supposing, they \nasked, someone\u0014\n                      actually found the bones of Jesus lying around \nin Palestine:\u0014\n                      What would that do to Christian faith? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So they looked for ossuariesbone boxes. They \nfound one\u0014\n                      inscribed \"Jesus, son of Joseph\" (actually, \nthey found more\u0014\n                      than one, but they only followed up one). It \nhad been found in\u0014\n                      a family tomb; and in the same family tomb were \nother boxes,\u0014\n                      labeled Joseph, Mary, another Mary, a Matthew, \nand\u0014\n                      someone called Judah, described as \"the son of \nJesus.\" The\u0014\n                      boxes were empty: vandals had apparently got \nthere first,\u0014\n                      possibly in antiquity. Now, journalists are \ngood at putting two\u0014\n                      and two together and making seventeen. Could \nthis be Jesus'\u0014\n                      tomb? Would it cast doubt on the very \nfoundations of\u0014\n                      Christianity? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The first thing to say is that, even if nobody \nhad ever said\u0014\n                      Jesus of Nazareth had been raised to life, the \nprobability is\u0014\n                      still enormously high that this would not have \nbeen the tomb\u0014\n                      of the Jesus, Mary, and Joseph we know from the \nGospels.\u0014\n                      \"Mary\" is by far the most common female name in \nthe period;\u0014\n                      \"Joseph\" and \"Jesus\" are two of the most common \nmale\u0014\n                      names, with Judahor Judasnot far behind. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Discovering a tomb with these names in one \nfamily is rather\u0014\n                      like an archaeologist two thousand years hence \nfinding an\u0014\n                      English tomb with parents called Philip and \nElizabeth and\u0014\n                      children called Charles and Anne, and claiming \nthat this must\u0014\n                      be the British royal family. The Israeli \narchaeologists, none of\u0014\n                      them interested in defending Christianity, were \nthe first to\u0014\n                      pooh-pooh the idea of this being the tomb of \nJesus of\u0014\n                      Nazareth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, if it had been the tomb of Jesus and \nhis family, there\u0014\n                      are serious oddities. Why is it in Jerusalem, \nwhen the family\u0014\n                      lived in Nazareth where, presumably, Joseph had \ndied some\u0014\n                      time before Jesus' public ministry? Why is \nthere no mention\u0014\n                      of James, Jesus' most famous brother, or of \nJoses and Simon\u0014\n                      (as listed in Mark 6:3, along with some unnamed \nsisters)?\u0014\n                      And why is there a son of Jesus? There is no \nevidence\u0014\n                      whatever that Jesus had children, whether in or \nout of\u0014\n                      wedlock; his familythat is, his brothers and \nnephewswere\u0014\n                      well known in the early church. Sixty years \nafter Jesus' death,\u0014\n                      his grandnephews were accused by the Roman \nemperor\u0014\n                      Domitian of being part of a would-be royal \nfamily. If Jesus had\u0014\n                      had a son, people would have known. It would \nhave mattered. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the most serious problem is yet to come, \nand this points\u0014\n                      forward to the real message of Easter: Bone\u0014\n                      boxesossuarieswere used in the second stage \nof a\u0014\n                      two-stage burial process. Many first-century \nJews were buried\u0014\n                      this way. First they were laid on a slab, \nwrapped in cloth with\u0014\n                      spices. The tomb was a cave, not a hole in the \nground. It\u0014\n                      would have a movable stone door; the family and \nfriends\u0014\n                      would in due course lay other bodies on other \nshelves in the\u0014\n                      same cave. Then, a year or more later, when all \nthe flesh had\u0014\n                      decomposed, relatives or friends would return \nto collect the\u0014\n                      bones and place them in an ossuary, a box \nroughly two feet\u0014\n                      by one foot by one foot, which would then be \nstored away\u0014\n                      either in recesses within the same cave or \nsomewhere else.\u0014\n                      In other words, the burial of Jesus as recorded \nin the Gospels\u0014\n                      was only the first stage of an intended \ntwo-stage burial. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So, did anyone ever think of going back to the \ntomb to collect\u0014\n                      Jesus' bones and put them in an ossuary? No, \nthey didn't!\u0014\n                      The whole early church knew that Jesus' body \nwasn't in the\u0014\n                      tomb. They believed that God had raised Jesus \nto life again,\u0014\n                      transforming his body in the process. This \nwasn't a\u0014\n                      resuscitation, a journey back into the present \nlife; it was a\u0014\n                      resurrection, a going on through death and out \nthe other side\u0014\n                      into a new mode of physicality, the beginning \nof God's new\u0014\n                      creation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If the disciples had believed that what they \ncalled the\u0014\n                      \"resurrection\" was just a \"spiritual\" event, \nleaving the body in\u0014\n                      the tomb, someone sooner or later would have \nhad to go back\u0014\n                      to collect Jesus' bones and store them \nproperly. The tomb\u0014\n                      was designed, like most such tombs of the \nperiod, as a\u0014\n                      family tomb. As additional family members died, \nthe relatives\u0014\n                      would in due course have come again with their \nbodies, to lay\u0014\n                      them elsewhere in the tomb. The ledge where \nJesus had been\u0014\n                      laid would be needed again. But of course, if \nanyone had at\u0014\n                      any stage gone back to tidy up Jesus' bones and \nput them in\u0014\n                      an ossuary, that would indeed have destroyed \nChristianity\u0014\n                      before it had even properly begun. Even those \ncontemporary\u0014\n                      scholars who deny that Jesus was raised bodily \nfrom the\u0014\n                      dead are clear that all the early Christians \nthought he had\u0014\n                      been, and that they made it the basis of their \nwhole lives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So the question of the ossuaries, when we \nexplore it\u0014\n                      thoroughly, provides paradoxically a sort of \nnegative evidence\u0014\n                      in favor of Jesus' resurrection. Not only is \nthe tomb the\u0014\n                      journalists highlighted not Jesus' tomb. By \ndrawing attention\u0014\n                      to the two-stage burial process, they have \nreminded us of how\u0014\n                      impossible it is to imagine Christianity \ngetting off the ground\u0014\n                      at all if the second stage of the burial \nprocess had ever been\u0014\n                      carried out. Make no bones about it. In their \neagerness to find\u0014\n                      news, the journalists have accidentally \nhighlighted the good\u0014\n                      news. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      WHAT EASTER FAITH MEANS\u0014\n                      Someone on a radio show in Holy Week, after the \noriginal\u0014\n                      Sunday Times article, declared that it didn't \nmatter if Jesus'\u0014\n                      bones were still lying around Palestine \nsomewhere. \"I expect\u0014\n                      to go to heaven when I die,\" he said, \"and I \nwon't be taking\u0014\n                      my bones with me; so I don't see why Jesus \nshouldn't have\u0014\n                      done the same.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I suspect that this idea, or something like it, \nis quite\u0014\n                      widespread, and it's worth pointing out the \nmistake. Belief in\u0014\n                      Jesus' resurrection is not the belief that \nJesus has simply\u0014\n                      \"gone to heaven\" after his death, as though \nJesus were like a\u0014\n                      great saint or martyr whom God has received \ninto his\u0014\n                      presence with honor. Jews believed that about \nall sorts of\u0014\n                      people; it wouldn't have been new; it wouldn't \nhave been news.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Easter faith always was the belief that Jesus \nwent through\u0014\n                      death into a new sort of bodily existence in \nwhich his original\u0014\n                      body was transformed into a body with new \ncharacteristics\u0014\n                      and properties. When Paul, the first Christian \nto write about\u0014\n                      the resurrection, draws conclusions from Jesus' \nresurrection\u0014\n                      about our future resurrection, he says that \nthose who are still\u0014\n                      alive at the end of time will have their bodies \nchanged. He\u0014\n                      talks about seeds and plants, about acorns and \noaks. Our\u0014\n                      bodies won't be abandoned; they will be \ntransformed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So what was the Resurrection all about, as far \nas the early\u0014\n                      Christians were concerned? And what on \nearthand I mean\u0014\n                      on earthdoes it mean for the world and the \nchurch at the\u0014\n                      end of the twentieth century? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The early Christians very quickly came to \nunderstand what\u0014\n                      had happened to Jesus in terms of the old \nJewish, biblical\u0014\n                      belief that the living God was one day going to \nsolve the\u0014\n                      problem of Israel's exile and oppression. By \ndoing so, God\u0014\n                      was going to solve the problem of evil and \ninjustice in the\u0014\n                      whole world. That is what it means to say that \nthe\u0014\n                      Resurrection took place \"according to the \nscriptures\": it was\u0014\n                      the fulfillment of prophetic promises and \nlong-cherished\u0014\n                      hopes. Putting it succinctly, the Resurrection \ndemonstrated\u0014\n                      that the Cross was a victory, not a defeat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Paul says, if Christ is not raised, your \nfaith is futile, and\u0014\n                      you are still in your sins (1 Cor. 15:17). But \nif Christ has been\u0014\n                      raised, then this shows that on the cross he \ndefeated death,\u0014\n                      and hence sin, and hence all evil and \ninjustice, once and for\u0014\n                      all. Easter is the unveiling of God's answer to \nthe problems of\u0014\n                      the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The message of the Resurrection is\u0014\n                      that this present world matters.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The early Christian belief in the resurrection \nof Jesus was a\u0014\n                      belief about something that actually happened \nwithin this real\u0014\n                      world, not simply a belief about a transcendent \ndimension, a\u0014\n                      spiritual or otherworldly reality that leaves \nthis world behind.\u0014\n                      Likewise, the continuing message of the \nResurrection is\u0014\n                      precisely not that \"there is a life after \ndeath.\" There is life after\u0014\n                      death, and all God's people will inherit it; \nbut the point is that\u0014\n                      it won't be what most modern Westerners think \nof as \"life\u0014\n                      after death.\" It will involve God's people \nbeing given new\u0014\n                      bodies, like Jesus' body, to share in the new \nheavens and\u0014\n                      new earth that God will make. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      WHY EASTER MATTERS\u0014\n                      The message of the Resurrection is that this \npresent world\u0014\n                      matters; that the problems and pains of this \npresent world\u0014\n                      matter; that the living God has made a decisive \nbridgehead\u0014\n                      into this present world with his healing and \nall-conquering\u0014\n                      love; and that, in the name of this strong \nlove, all the evils, all\u0014\n                      the injustices, and all the pains of the \npresent world must now\u0014\n                      be addressed with the news that healing, \njustice, and love\u0014\n                      have won the day. That's why we pray: \"Thy \nkingdom come,\u0014\n                      on earth as it is in heaven.\" Make no bones \nabout it: Easter\u0014\n                      Day was the first great answer to that prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If Easter faith is simply about believing that \nGod has a nice\u0014\n                      comfortable afterlife for some or all of us, \nthen Christianity\u0014\n                      becomes a mere pie-in-the-sky religion instead \nof a\u0014\n                      kingdom-on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven religion. \nIf Easter faith is\u0014\n                      simply about believing that Jesus is risen in \nsome \"spiritual\"\u0014\n                      sense, leaving his body in the tomb, then \nChristianity turns\u0014\n                      into a let-the-world-stew-in-its-own-juice \nreligion, instead of a\u0014\n                      kingdom-on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven religion. \nIf Easter faith is\u0014\n                      only about me, and perhaps you, finding a new \ndimension to\u0014\n                      our own personal spiritual lives in the here \nand now, then\u0014\n                      Christianity becomes simply a \nwarmth-in-the-heart religion\u0014\n                      instead of a \nkingdom-on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven religion. It\u0014\n                      becomes focused on me and my survival, my sense \nof God,\u0014\n                      my spirituality, rather than outwards on God \nand on God's\u0014\n                      world that still needs the kingdom message so \nbadly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But if Jesus Christ is truly risen from the \ndead, Christianity\u0014\n                      becomes what the New Testament insists that it \nis: good\u0014\n                      news for the whole world, news that warms our \nhearts\u0014\n                      precisely because it isn't just about warming \nhearts. The living\u0014\n                      God has in principle dealt with evil once and \nfor all, and is\u0014\n                      now at work, by his own Spirit, to do for us \nand the whole\u0014\n                      world what he did for Jesus on that first \nEaster Day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That is why we who celebrate Easter do so with \nmaterial\u0014\n                      things: water in baptism and bread and wine at \nthe Lord's\u0014\n                      Supper. Easter is about the living God claiming \nthe world of\u0014\n                      space, time, and matter as his own. That is why \nChristians\u0014\n                      celebrate it with candles and flowers and \nincense and\u0014\n                      processions and banners and, above all, music: \nthe world of\u0014\n                      creation has been reclaimed by the living and \nhealing God.\u0014\n                      That is why we who celebrate Easter after a \nLenten fast do so\u0014\n                      not with a guilty sense of going back to things \nthat are tainted\u0014\n                      with sin, but with the joyful sense of \ncelebrating the goodness\u0014\n                      of God's good creation in all its rich variety. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      HOW WE CELEBRATE EASTER\u0014\n                      The celebration of Easter calls us, one and \nall, to delight in\u0014\n                      God's way of holiness: not a negative, gloomy \nholiness, but a\u0014\n                      positive giving of ourselves to God in the \nknowledge that his\u0014\n                      way is the way of true delight, of true \nfulfillment. And that is\u0014\n                      why the celebration of Easter, in a world, a \ncountry, and a\u0014\n                      region where injustice, violence, degradation, \nand all manner\u0014\n                      of wickedness are still endemic, makes the most \npowerful\u0014\n                      symbolic statement that we are not prepared to \ntolerate such\u0014\n                      thingsthat God is not prepared to tolerate \nsuch thingsand\u0014\n                      that we will work, and plan, and pray, and vote \nwith all the\u0014\n                      energy of God to implement the victory of Jesus \nover them all.\u0014\n                      True Easter faith, true Easter celebration, and \ntrue Easter\u0014\n                      holiness must issue in true Easter agendas. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Recall the old jibe of Karl Marx and others, \nthat Christianity\u0014\n                      lulls people into being content with their lot \nor content to look\u0014\n                      on other people's misery and injustice because \nit speaks only\u0014\n                      about a spiritualized heaven in the future and \na spiritual\u0014\n                      experience here and now. That jibe is a fair \ncritique of a\u0014\n                      watered-down Christianity that tries to say \nthat Jesus' body,\u0014\n                      like John Brown's, stayed amouldering in the \ngrave while his\u0014\n                      soul went marching on. But it misses entirely \nthe point of the\u0014\n                      true Christian belief in the Resurrection. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Notice how, in the Gospels, all the first \nwitnesses of the\u0014\n                      Resurrection run. Half the references in the \nGospels to people\u0014\n                      running occur in the Resurrection stories: the \nwomen run from\u0014\n                      the tomb, Peter and John run to the tomb, the \ndisciples in\u0014\n                      Emmaus hurry back to Jerusalem. Where is that \nenergy in\u0014\n                      the church today, a God-given energy that can't \nwait to get\u0014\n                      the good news out and to implement it in the \nworld? If it is\u0014\n                      lacking, could it have something to do with the \nfact that far\u0014\n                      too many Christians have been lulled into \nthinking that God\u0014\n                      isn't really concerned with this world, so that \nthe Resurrection\u0014\n                      of Jesus is not about something happening \nwithin this world,\u0014\n                      so that the only thing that matters is my \nprivate otherworldly\u0014\n                      salvation? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The bodily resurrection of Jesus isn't a \ntake-it-or-leave-it thing,\u0014\n                      as though some Christians are welcome to \nbelieve it and\u0014\n                      others are welcome not to believe it. Take it \naway, and the\u0014\n                      whole picture is totally different. Take it \naway, and Karl Marx\u0014\n                      was probably right to accuse Christianity of \nignoring the\u0014\n                      problems of the material world. Take it away, \nand Sigmund\u0014\n                      Freud was probably right to say that \nChristianity is a\u0014\n                      wish-fulfillment religion. Take it away, and \nFriedrich Nietzsche\u0014\n                      was probably right to say that Christianity is \na religion for\u0014\n                      wimps. Put it back, and you have a faith that \ncan take on the\u0014\n                      postmodern world that looks to Marx, Freud, and \nNietzsche\u0014\n                      as its prophets; you can beat them at their own \ngame with\u0014\n                      the Easter news that the foolishness of God is \nwiser than\u0014\n                      human wisdom, and the weakness of God is \nstronger than\u0014\n                      human strength. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those who celebrate the mighty resurrection of \nthe Lord\u0014\n                      Jesus Christ, therefore, have an awesome and \nnonnegotiable\u0014\n                      responsibility. When we say \"Alleluia! Christ \nis risen,\" we are\u0014\n                      saying that Jesus is Lord of the world, and \nthat the present\u0014\n                      would-be lords of the world are not. When we \nsing, in the old\u0014\n                      hymn, that \"Judah's Lion burst his chains and \ncrushed the\u0014\n                      serpent's head,\" are we ready to put that \nvictory into practice?\u0014\n                      Are we ready to speak up for, and to take \naction on behalf of,\u0014\n                      those even in our own local community, let \nalone farther\u0014\n                      afield, who are quietly being crushed by \nuncaring and unjust\u0014\n                      systems? Are we ready to speak up for the truth \nof the gospel\u0014\n                      over the dinner table and in the coffee bar, \nand in the council\u0014\n                      chamber? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Let's make no bones about it: If Easter isn't \ngood news, then\u0014\n                      there is no good news. But if it isif it is \ntrue that Jesus\u0014\n                      Christ is risen indeedthen Easter Day, and the \nEaster\u0014\n                      message, is the true sun which, when it rises, \nputs all other\u0014\n                      suns to shame. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      N.

    "words": "God vs. God\u0014\n                      Two competing theologies vie for the future of \nevangelicalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is no more boring concept of God than \nthat traditionally\u0014\n                      presented by philosophical theism. Besides \nwhich, who\u0014\n                      wants to pray to an abstract and uninvolved \ndeity? Certainly,\u0014\n                      the classic philosophical arguments tend to \nyield a \"maximal\u0014\n                      Being\" rather than the God of the Bible who \nloves his\u0014\n                      creatures passionately and hates corruption and \noppression.\u0014\n                      The biblical God is not boring, but is, as \nPascal wrote: \"Fire!\u0014\n                      God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not \nof the\u0014\n                      philosophers and scholars. Certitude. \nCertitude. Feeling. Joy.\u0014\n                      Peace. God of Jesus Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       At the Evangelical Theological\u0014\n                                       Society's meeting in November,\u0014\n                                       several scholars updated the \nclassical\u0014\n                                       philosophical arguments for \nGodnot\u0014\n                                       as a mere philosophical \nexercise, but\u0014\n                                       as an attempt to oppose a \ngrowing\u0014\n                                       challenge to classic \nunderstandings\u0014\n                                       about God. Called \"openness of \nGod\"\u0014\n                      theology, the challenge has threatened to split \nat least one\u0014\n                      denomination. Openness theology (although it \nhas been\u0014\n                      influenced by process philosophy) roots its \npopular appeal in\u0014\n                      the biblical picture of a God who is \npassionately loving and\u0014\n                      bent on rescuing the lost creatures he loves. \nSuch a God,\u0014\n                      this theology argues, does not exist in \nchangeless perfection\u0014\n                      outside of time, but must rather take risks by \nengaging his\u0014\n                      lost creatures in truly mutual relationships \nthat have no\u0014\n                      guaranteed outcomes. Thus God does not \ngenuinely know\u0014\n                      the future, and he actually changes his mind \nwhen shifting\u0014\n                      situations demand it. That picture of Godwhich \nhas\u0014\n                      important implications for prayer, for \nprophecy, and for\u0014\n                      eschatologyis what these classical scholars \nwere trying to\u0014\n                      combat.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Clark Pinnock, the Canadian Baptist theologian \nwho\u0014\n                      pioneered openness theology, issued an \nimportant challenge\u0014\n                      after one of these philosophical papers. \"You \nhave just made\u0014\n                      a very liberal move,\" Pinnock said. \"You have \nconstructed\u0014\n                      your belief from philosophy first and only \nsecond checked it\u0014\n                      with Scripture.\" Then Pinnock posed the simple \nquestion:\u0014\n                      \"What do you make of the Scriptures that say \nGod changed\u0014\n                      his mind?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The responsethat such passages are\u0014\n                      \"anthropomorphisms\"begged the question. It \ndoes not help\u0014\n                      the case for classical theism to call something\u0014\n                      anthropomorphism. That just leads to the \nfurther questions of\u0014\n                      when and how we know something is an\u0014\n                      anthropomorphismand, even more importantly, \nwhat that\u0014\n                      anthropomorphism is designed to communicate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This brief exchange, which occurred in a \nhotel's small\u0014\n                      meeting room, exemplifies a larger reality, \nthough there\u0014\n                      certainly are classical theists who are \nengaging the questions\u0014\n                      more deeply. As theologians like Pinnock, John \nSanders\u0014\n                      (author of The God Who Risks, 1998), and Greg \nBoyd (author\u0014\n                      of God of the Possible, forthcoming in May) \npopularize the\u0014\n                      openness argument, they appeal boldly to \nScripture and\u0014\n                      seem to take the biblical high ground. For \nclassical theists to\u0014\n                      retreat into philosophy is a serious mistake \nstrategically. The\u0014\n                      primary evangelical impulse when confronted \nwith any issue\u0014\n                      or teaching is to ask: What does Scripture say? \nAnd what\u0014\n                      does it mean?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When God repents\u0014\n                      Does God change his mind? The Bible says he \ndoes. To use\u0014\n                      the quaint language of the King James Version, \n\"It repented\u0014\n                      the Lord that he had made man on the earth\" \n(Gen. 6:6) and\u0014\n                      \"God repented of the evil, that he had said \nthat he would do\u0014\n                      unto\" the people of Nineveh (Jonah 3:10).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Classical theists have long reconciled these \ntexts to the\u0014\n                      church's traditional teaching that God is in \nhis essence\u0014\n                      changeless, knows and declares the end from the \nbeginning,\u0014\n                      and exists outside the flow of time as we \nmortals experience\u0014\n                      it. They know the Bible not only tells stories \nin which God\u0014\n                      changes his mind, but that it also talks about \nthe\u0014\n                      changelessness and complete foreknowledge of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, the Bible more than philosophy informs \nour worship\u0014\n                      when we sing about God's changelessness. \"Great \nIs Thy\u0014\n                      Faithfulness\" (\"There is no shadow of turning \nwith thee\")\u0014\n                      reverberates with echoes of James 1:6 (with God \n\"there is no\u0014\n                      variation or shadow due to change\"). And the \nclassic hymn\u0014\n                      \"Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise\" rephrases \nIsaiah with\u0014\n                      these words: \"We blossom and flourish as leaves \non the tree,\u0014\n                      / And wither and perish but nought changeth \nthee.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      These and other passages should keep us from \nreading the\u0014\n                      Bible's anthropomorphisms simplistically. If we \ntook them at\u0014\n                      face value, we should as likely sing Joan \nOsborne's 1995 hit\u0014\n                      \"What If God Was One of Us\" in church. Her song\u0014\n                      impoverishes the glorious idea of the \nIncarnation and turns\u0014\n                      God into a poor bewildered \"stranger on the bus \n/ trying to\u0014\n                      make his way home.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What happens when God is said to change his \nmind? Here\u0014\n                      the proponents of classical theism and openness \npart ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The classic understanding is that God speaks \nabout himself\u0014\n                      anthropomorphically or analogically (as \nsuggested by the\u0014\n                      cartoon that appears here) all the way through \nScripturenot\u0014\n                      just in a few places. In every noun, verb, and \nadjective God\u0014\n                      has used to present himself, certain notions of \nlimitation and\u0014\n                      moral inadequacy apply to the human word that \nmust be\u0014\n                      deleted when we apply it to God. So when God \nappears to\u0014\n                      change in response to Nineveh's repentance, the\u0014\n                      antediluvian's evils, or King Saul's failures, \nwe recognize the\u0014\n                      anthropomorphic nature of the speech and seek \nthe\u0014\n                      analogical meaning in it. At the heart of the \nidea of\u0014\n                      anthropomorphism is the idea that though we \nspeak of God\u0014\n                      by means of human analogy, we do not have \naccess to the\u0014\n                      inner workings of his mind. Thus the classical \napproach\u0014\n                      makes no attempt to psychologize God in human \nterms. It\u0014\n                      follows the prophet Samuel's idea that God \"is \nnot a man that\u0014\n                      he should repent\" (1 Sam. 15:29, RSV).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The openness theologians, on the other hand, \nseem to take\u0014\n                      this language as a clue to the working of God's \nmind, and\u0014\n                      they try to fit all that is said about his \nimmutability, his plan\u0014\n                      for history from beginning to end, and his \nsovereign control\u0014\n                      over all that comes to pass into the frame of a \nmind-changing\u0014\n                      God. Thus they psychologize God. They treat \nwhat is said of\u0014\n                      God as having only one layer of meaning (that \nis, univocal)\u0014\n                      rather than analogical. God is thus pictured as \nlike us in a\u0014\n                      way that merits Voltaire's observation that God \nmade man in\u0014\n                      his own image and ever since man has been \nseeking to return\u0014\n                      the compliment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Historic Christian theology would criticize \nthis confusion of\u0014\n                      the analogical with the univocal by saying it \nreflected a certain\u0014\n                      carelessness in theological method. But modern \nevangelical\u0014\n                      exponents of the classical view have their own \nproblems in\u0014\n                      speaking of God. They need to rethink the \ndoctrine of\u0014\n                      analogy. Much fresh labor on working out this \nanalogical\u0014\n                      nature of revelation is needed before either \nposition can be\u0014\n                      stated adequately. The critiques on both sides \nare premature.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The openness theologians often complain that \nthe teaching of\u0014\n                      an unchanging God is more dependent on Greek \nphilosophy\u0014\n                      than on the Hebrew Scriptures. While the \nScriptures do teach\u0014\n                      an unchanging God, the theology taught in many \nof our\u0014\n                      seminaries owes as much to medieval \nscholasticism as it\u0014\n                      does to the Bible. Luther and other Reformers \nmanaged to\u0014\n                      resist some of these philosophical influences, \nbut they were\u0014\n                      employed by the seventeenth-century Swiss \ntheologian\u0014\n                      Turretin, picked up by the great Princeton\u0014\n                      theologiansAlexander, Hodges, and Warfieldand \nthen\u0014\n                      transmitted to Louis Berkhof.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      All of this happened without serious critical \nreflection, say\u0014\n                      some theologians, and thus an honored, noble \ntradition\u0014\n                      became a suspect traditionalism. Evangelical \nphilosophers\u0014\n                      have paid great attention in recent years to \nthe appropriate\u0014\n                      verbalizing of our concept of God. It is now up \nto the\u0014\n                      theologians to work equally hard at checking \nand, if need be,\u0014\n                      adjusting the conceptual formulations of \nyesteryear, without\u0014\n                      sacrificing what mainstream orthodox \nChristians, Catholic and\u0014\n                      Protestant, Calvinist and Arminian alike, have \nheld about\u0014\n                      God's omniscience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Setting a future course\u0014\n                      This debate will not be settled by one \neditorial, and we hope\u0014\n                      to explore the issues raised by the openness \ntheologians\u0014\n                      more fully in future issues of Christianity \nToday. But for the\u0014\n                      time being, we'd like to ask both sides to do \nsome homework:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           1. Openness theologians, please take as \nfull an\u0014\n                           account of the biblical language about \nGod's\u0014\n                           foreknowledge and immutability as of the \nGreek\u0014\n                           philosophical influences that shaped \nclassical\u0014\n                           theism. Such research can only strengthen\u0014\n                           your argument.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           2. Classical theists, please return to a \nmore\u0014\n                           robustly biblical approach to talking \nabout God.\u0014\n                           Of course, using biblical language is no\u0014\n                           guarantee of orthodoxy. (The church's \ngreatest\u0014\n                           heretics, including Arius, have employed \nbiblical\u0014\n                           language.) But the biblical revelation, \nand not a\u0014\n                           suspect theological traditionalism, must \nbe the\u0014\n                           starting point for fresh theological \nreflection in\u0014\n                           every generation. If classical theists \nfail to be\u0014\n                           biblical, they will surely lose the debate \nwhere it\u0014\n                           counts: in the churches.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           3. Classical theists, again, please make a \nfull\u0014\n                           account of the meaning embedded in the \nBible's\u0014\n                           anthropomorphismsnot to explain them away\u0014\n                           but to unpack them, and not to treat them\u0014\n                           dismissively, as though they were a rude \nnoise\u0014\n                           at a formal dinner, better ignored than\u0014\n                           acknowledged. God doesn't waste words.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           4. Both sides, do not attempt to read the \nwords\u0014\n                           of Scripture outside the context of twenty\u0014\n                           centuries of interpretation. The Holy \nSpirit has\u0014\n                           not been snoozing since he inspired the New\u0014\n                           Testament. Please read the Scriptures with \nthe\u0014\n                           help of those who have gone before.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now, let's go do our homework.\u0014",

    "words": "God Creating The \nFather\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the good Lord was creating Fathers he started with a tall frame. \nAnd a\u0014\nfemale angel nearby said, \"What kind of Father is that? If you're \ngoing to\u0014\nmake children so close to the ground, why have you put Fathers up so \nhigh?\u0014\nHe won't be able to shoot marbles without kneeling, tuck a child in \nbed\u0014\nwithout bending, or even kiss a child without a lot of stooping.\" And \nGod\u0014\nsmiled and said, \"Yes, but if I make him child-size, who would \nchildren have\u0014\nto look up to?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd when God made a Father's hands, they were large and sinewy. And \nthe\u0014\nangel shook her head sadly and said, \"Do you know what you're doing? \nLarge\u0014\nhands are clumsy. They can't manage diaper pins, small buttons, \nrubber bands\u0014\non pony tails or even remove splinters caused by baseball bats.\" And \nGod\u0014\nsmiled and said, \"I know, but they're large enough to hold everything \na\u0014\nsmall boy empties from his pockets at the end of a day...yet small \nenough to\u0014\ncup a child's face in his hands.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then God molded long, slim legs and broad shoulders. And the angel\u0014\nnearly had a heart attack. \"Boy, this is the end of the week, all \nright,\"\u0014\nshe clucked. \"Do you realize you just made a Father without a lap? \nHow is he\u0014\ngoing to pull a child close to him without the kid falling between his\u0014\nlegs?\" And God smiled and said, \"A mother needs a lap. A father needs \nstrong\u0014\nshoulders to pull a sled, balance a boy on a bicycle, and hold a \nsleepy head\u0014\non the way home from the circus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod was in the middle of creating two of the largest feet anyone had \nevery\u0014\nseen when the angel could contain herself no longer. \"That's not \nfair. Do\u0014\nyou honestly think those large boats are going to dig out of bed \nearly in\u0014\nthe morning when the baby cries? Or walk through a small birthday \nparty\u0014\nwithout crushing at least three of the guests?\" And God smiled and \nsaid,\u0014\n\"They'll work. You'll see. They'll support a small child who wants to \nride a\u0014\nhorse to Banbury Cross, or scare off mice at the summer cabin, or \ndisplay\u0014\nshoes that will be a challenge to fill.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod worked throughout the night, giving the Father few words, but a \nfirm\u0014\nauthoritative voice; eyes that saw everything, but remained calm and\u0014\ntolerant. Finally, almost as an afterthought, he added tears. Then he \nturned\u0014\nto the angel and said, \"Now, are you satisfied that he can love as \nmuch as a\u0014\nMother?\" The angel shuteth up.\u0014\n\u0014\nErma Bombeck.\u0014",

He put the \"lump\" in \"lumpenproletariat.\" \"All \nin the Family,\" the\u0014\n              boundary-shattering comedy about what folks used to \ncall \"the generation\u0014\n              gap,\" would have been a classic regardless, because of \nthe passion of\u0014\n              producer Norman Lear's ideas and the strength of his \nwriting. But the show\u0014\n              would not have had the resonance it did, and Archie \nBunker would not be\u0014\n              one of the three or four most important characters in \nTV history, without\u0014\n              Carroll O'Connor. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Because, make no mistake, the man was acting. Unlike \nhis braying,\u0014\n              spluttering character, O'Connor was born in the Bronx \nbut his real voice\u0014\n              was no Bronx cheer; he was soft-spoken and thoughtful \nand said that he\u0014\n              never heard Archie Bunkerisms growing up in his \nwell-off childhood home.\u0014\n              An accomplished journeyman stage and film actor, \nO'Connor made Archie\u0014\n              into a character  dry and operatic, hateful and \ntouching  where a\u0014\n              cartoon would have sufficed. It would have been easy to \nmake Archie a\u0014\n              caricature (and he was one) or a straw man (he was that \ntoo). It would\u0014\n              have been easy to make audiences laugh at him or \ndislike him. Dozens of\u0014\n              actors could have made Archie Bunker a punch line. \nCarroll O'Connor\u0014\n              made him a part of American history. \u0014\n\u0014\n              O'Connor's Archie Bunker  at least for the show's raw, \ngroundbreaking\u0014\n              first half-decade  captured a moment that political \nhistorians take for\u0014\n              granted now but that Americans were only vaguely aware \nof at the time:\u0014\n              the splintering of the classic New Deal Democrat \ncoalition. Blue-collar\u0014\n              union guys (like Archie) had depended on FDR and \norganized labor to\u0014\n              secure them contracts, provide Social Security, look \nafter their comfort: in\u0014\n              short, to protect them and keep their world stable. \nSocial justice to Archie\u0014\n              was a pot roast on their table and an evening sit-down \nin his favorite chair.\u0014\n              He was Nixon's \"silent majority\" personified; he was a \nReagan Democrat\u0014\n              years before anyone knew they existed. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Now a younger generation of liberals (like his \nson-in-law Michael\u0014\n              \"Meathead\" Stivic) was upsetting all that. Their \nantiwar stance was, in his\u0014\n              eyes, an insult to his Greatest Generation experience; \ntheir sexual\u0014\n              openness shocked his values; and  most shocking to him \nand to viewers\u0014\n               their emphasis on civil rights opened the floodgates \nto minorities and\u0014\n              rival ethnic groups, whom he called \"spades\" and \"wops\" \nand \"Hebes\" and\u0014\n              so on without flinching. The flinching, O'Connor left \nup to us; he never\u0014\n              acted to make us love or hate Archie, he said, but just \nto convey the truth\u0014\n              of him as best he could. \u0014\n\u0014\n              \"All in the Family\" was really a years-long territorial \nwar fought in the home\u0014\n              (it's no accident the character's name was \"Bunker\"). \nO'Connor played\u0014\n              Archie like a shambling, endangered silverback gorilla \nprowling and\u0014\n              growling futilely around the carpeted perimeter of his \nliving room. The\u0014\n              values he developed through the depression and a war \nwere fraying and\u0014\n              decaying like his upholstered TV-watching throne. (The \nprominence of his\u0014\n              other throne  the upstairs toilet whose on-air \nflushing was so shocking\u0014\n              three decades ago  underscored the theme of Archie as \nan Astoria King\u0014\n              Lear.) \u0014\n\u0014\n              Archie fought the sexual revolution by bemoaning the \nlusty couplings of\u0014\n              Meathead and his \"little goil\" Gloria. He fought \nfeminism in the person of\u0014\n              cousin Maude (and, more subtly, his traditional but \nsteel-spined wife Edith)\u0014\n              and integration in the person of his neighbors the \nJeffersons. And when\u0014\n              the show sometimes veered into preachiness and staged \neditorials, he\u0014\n              kept it grounded with his casual, rumpled humor. \u0014\n\u0014\n              O'Connor's performance remade that most stable of \narchetypes, the TV\u0014\n              Dad. He prefigured Homer Simpson and Al Bundy; he took \nRalph Kramden\u0014\n              out of the realm of buffoonery and carried him to his \nlogical extreme; he\u0014\n              took the omniscient, benevolent TV dad of the '50s and \nexploded that\u0014\n              figure as irrevocably as a gunpowder-stuffed tobacco \npipe. Sure, this was\u0014\n              a slap in the face of conservatives, who chafed at the \nshow's Norman Lear\u0014\n              liberalism. But the O'Connor's genius was that he \nplayed the part well\u0014\n              enough to discomfit ideologues on the left too. Archie \nBunker proved that\u0014\n              satire is TV's most dangerous genre, because it cannot \nbe controlled  it\u0014\n              requires interpretation, which is anathema to true \nbelievers. \u0014\n\u0014\n              The left-wing knock against \"All in the Family,\" and \nmore specifically\u0014\n              against O'Connor's performance, was that people might \nenjoy it for the\u0014\n              wrong reasons: bigots could use his most troglodytic \ninsults, or sexists\u0014\n              could call their wives \"dingbats,\" and claim they were \njust quoting Archie.\u0014\n              Worse, they argued, he made his working-class antihero \nempathetic and\u0014\n              therefore, they argued, made his beliefs attractive. \nWrong. Archie Bunker\u0014\n              spoke to a whole country engaged in a second American \ncivil war, fighting\u0014\n              bitterly in their own living rooms with people they \nloved nonetheless. If he\u0014\n              was too unreconstructed to admire, he was too real to \ndismiss: if you could\u0014\n              not see yourself, or at least someone you loved, in \nArchie Bunker, his\u0014\n              performance would have been meaningless, a feel-good \ntonic for a few\u0014\n              progressive troops. \u0014\n\u0014\n              By making us feel for Archie Bunker, Carroll O'Connor \nmade us think about\u0014\n              Archie Bunker. It was a job he did so well it dogged \nthe rest of his career\u0014\n              (even though he went on to win another Emmy as a \nsouthern police chief\u0014\n              in \"In the Heat of the Night\"), so well that it seemed \neasy, obvious and to\u0014\n              some, dangerous. And that, my friends, is what you call \nacting. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Time Magazine, 6/29/01\u0014",

    "words": "Giving a Bum a Hug \u0014\n\u0014\n      I walked down Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. There was a \u0014\n      filthy bum, covered with soot from head to toe. He had a huge \u0014\n      beard. I'll never forget the beard. It was a gigantic beard \u0014\n      with rotted food stuck in it. He held a cup of McDonald's \u0014\n      coffee and mumbled as he walked along the street. He spotted \u0014\n      me and said, \"Hey, Mister. You want some of my coffee?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      I knew I should take some to be nice, and I did. I gave it \u0014\n      back to him and said, \"You're being pretty generous giving \u0014\n      away your coffee this morning. What's gotten into you that \u0014\n      you're giving away your coffee all of a sudden?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      He said, \"Well, the coffee was especially delicious this \u0014\n      morning, and I figured if God gives you something good you \u0014\n      ought to share it with people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      I figured, This is the perfect set up. I said, \"Is there \u0014\n      anything I can give you in return?\" I'm sure he's going to \u0014\n      hit me for five dollars. \u0014\n\u0014\n      He said, \"Yeah, you can give me a hug.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      I was hoping for the five dollars. \u0014\n\u0014\n      He put his arms around me. I put my arms around him. And I \u0014\n      realized something. He wasn't going to let me go. He was \u0014\n      holding onto me. Here I am an establishment guy, and this bum \u0014\n      is hanging on me. He's hugging me. He's not going to let me \u0014\n      go. People are passing on the street. They're staring at me. \u0014\n      I'm embarrassed. But little by little my embarrassment turned \u0014\n      to awe. \u0014\n\u0014\n      I heard a voice echoing down the corridors of time saying, I \u0014\n      was hungry. Did you feed me? I was naked. Did you clothe me? \u0014\n      I was sick. Did you care for me? I was the bum you met on \u0014\n      Chestnut Street. Did you hug me? For if you did it unto the \u0014\n      least of these, my brothers and sisters, you did it to me. \u0014\n      And if you failed to do it unto the least of these, my \u0014\n      brothers and sisters, you failed to do it unto me. \u0014\n\u0014\n      \u0014\n      Tony Campolo, \"Year of Jubilee,\" Preaching Today (212)\u0014",

(AP) - Powerball madness heightened on the \neve of the drawing for an estimated $280 million jackpot, with \nmillionaire hopefuls lining up in droves to get their hands on a \nticket to riches.\u0014\n\u0014\n          After buying her Powerball tickets Friday, Cindy Sherry \nprayed for a little ``divine grace,'' rubbing them against a bottle \nof holy water from a Roman Catholic church in Indianapolis. Sherry \nisn't Catholic, ``but I believe in covering all my bases.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Similar stories played out in Powerball states across the \nnation in anticipation of the Saturday night drawing.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In Connecticut, Greenwich got a break from the lottery \ncraze after receiving permission to suspend sales because the city \nwas swamped by residents from New York, which doesn't participate in \nthe multistate lottery. Powerball sales were to resume Saturday in \nGreenwich.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In West Virginia, Gale Robinson and Bob Mullen went \ntogether with some fellow employees at Beckley Heritage Equipment and \npurchased $135 in tickets for a jackpot whose odds are 80 \nmillion-to-1.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``Even the boss went in with us,'' Mullen said. ``He didn't \nwant to be the only one working there when we won.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          While lotto players like Robinson and Mullen were excited \nabout Powerball euphoria, some convenience store owners couldn't wait \nfor it to end.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I just hope someone wins soon, because I don't know how \nmuch more of this I can take,'' said Delicia Thompson, a cashier at \nU-Stop Convenience Shop in Lincoln, Neb. ``You can't get anything \ndone besides Powerball. When I get off work, I just go to bed. I'm \ntoo tired to do anything.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Workers at a factory in Tennessee chipped in $24,000 to buy \ntickets in a quick-riches gambit that stunned the owner of the store \nwhere they bought the tickets. It took an hour for the lottery \nterminal to spit out the $1tickets.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``We see a lot of big plays, but that was an exaggerated \nplay,'' said Arun Mahtani, owner of Lucky Lotto in Franklin, Ky., \nnear the Tennessee line.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Powerball frenzy has sent waves of carpoolers from Las \nVegas, the nation's gambling capital, across Hoover Dam and down U.S. \nHighway 93 to an Arizona cafe called Rose's Den. The clapboard \nroadhouse has homemade meatloaf, barbecued ribs - and tickets, which \nowner Rose Larsen figures have been selling at a clip of 60,000 every \nday.\u0014\n\u0014\n          One group rode bicycles more than 35 miles from New York \nCity's Central Park to Stamford. The bicyclists said they bought \nabout $5 worth of tickets each after the two-hour drive.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I have six kids I have to take care of,'' said Dexter \nWaiters, 43. ``That will buy a lot of everything. Maybe I can even \nquit my job.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          The biggest Powerball jackpot ever is the $295.7 million \nwon in 1998 by a group of factory workers in Ohio.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The richest lottery prize in U.S. history is the $363 \nmillion Big Game jackpot, won last year by two players in Illinois \nand Michigan.\u0014",

    "words": "God Gave U.S. 'What We \nDeserve,' Falwell Says \u0014\n\u0014\nBy John F. Harris\u0014\nWashington Post Staff Writer\u0014\nFriday, September 14, 2001; Page C03 \u0014\n\u0014\nTelevision evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, two of the \nmost prominent voices of the religious right, said liberal civil \nliberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights \nsupporters bear partial responsibility for Tuesday's terrorist \nattacks because their actions have turned God's anger against America.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America \nto give us probably what we deserve,\" said Falwell, appearing \nyesterday on the Christian Broadcasting Network's \"700 Club,\" hosted \nby Robertson.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jerry, that's my feeling,\" Robertson responded. \"I think we've just \nseen the antechamber to terror. We haven't even begun to see what \nthey can do to the major population.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFalwell said the American Civil Liberties Union has \"got to take a \nlot of blame for this,\" again winning Robertson's agreement: \"Well, \nyes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Falwell broadened his blast to include the federal courts and \nothers who he said were \"throwing God out of the public square.\" He \nadded: \"The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this \nbecause God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little \ninnocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, \nand the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the \nlesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative \nlifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way -- all of them who \nhave tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their face \nand say, 'You helped this happen.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople for the American Way transcribed the broadcast and denounced \nthe comments as running directly counter to President Bush's call for \nnational unity. Ralph G. Neas, the liberal group's president, called \nthe remarks \"absolutely inappropriate and irresponsible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertson and others on the religious right gave critical backing to \nBush last year when he was battling for the GOP  presidential \nnomination. A White House official called the remarks \"inappropriate\" \nand added, \"The president does not share those views.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFalwell was unrepentant, saying in an interview that he was \"making a \ntheological statement, not a legal statement.\" \"I put all the blame \nlegally and morally on the actions of the terrorist,\" he said. But he \nsaid America's \"secular and anti-Christian environment left us open \nto our Lord's [decision] not to protect. When a nation deserts God \nand expels God from the culture . . . the result is not good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertson was not available for comment, a spokeswoman said. But she \nreleased a statement echoing the remarks he made on his show. An ACLU \nspokeswoman said the group \"will not dignify the Falwell-Robertson \nremarks with a comment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                               2001 The Washington Post Company\u0014",

    "words": "A greatly insightful article!!  THE WORST KIND OF ISLAM FANATICS\u0014\n\u0014\nBY MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Getting the mayor's message\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is a time for moral clarity. New York \nMayor Rudy Giuliani is a role model for us \u0014\n                      all.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Since September 11, his leadership has been \ncalm and decisive, and now he has\u0014\n                      dramatized the insidious nature of moral \nrelativism by tearing up a check for $10\u0014\n                      million. The gift for the city from a Saudi \nprince was welcome. What was decidedly not\u0014\n                      welcome was the mendacious implication in his \naccompanying statement that the\u0014\n                      September 11 attacks were related to America's \nrelationship with Israel. The\u0014\n                      massacres at the World Trade Center, the \nPentagon, and in the Pennsylvania\u0014\n                      countryside cannot be explained, \nrationalizedstill less, justifiedby any supposed\u0014\n                      failing of American foreign policy. It was \nwicked. It was depraved. It was\u0014\n                      unconscionable. It was the work of psychopaths \ninflamed by an evil distortion of\u0014\n                      Islam. And now weand the Saudismust face the \nharsh fact that Saudi Arabia, a\u0014\n                      nation we have long supported, is a central \ndisseminator of the poisonous spores of\u0014\n                      fanaticism. It is a measure of this menace that \neven a Saudi as educated,\u0014\n                      sophisticated, and familiar with America as \nPrince Alwaleed bin Talal feels he has to\u0014\n                      compromise generosity with hypocrisy. Mayor \nGiuliani's gutsy rejection of the prince's\u0014\n                      check forces all of us to contemplate the Saudi \ndimension of terror, and with it the\u0014\n                      nature of the Islamic doctrine it fosters. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Saudi Arabia is the  home of a strain of  Islam \ncalled  Wahhabism. It is  one of the \u0014\n                      most\u0014\n                      fanatical, intolerant,  and extreme forms of \nIslamic fundamentalism.  This version of\u0014\n                      Islam has been  exported to many  Muslim \nmosques in  America, as well as  to other \u0014\n                      Islamic centers around the world, many financed \nby the Saudi royal family.  While        \u0014\n                      crushing any extreme anti-Islamic challenges to \nits power at home, Saudi Arabia has                        sought to \nensure its conservative religious credentials beyond the kingdom by \nsupporting extremist Islamic organizations like the Muslim \nBrotherhood and even, \u0014\n                      indirectly, Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brainwashing centers. Saudi Arabia's actions \nsince September 11 speak volumes\u0014\n                      about where its sympathies lie. When the FBI \nwanted to interview members of bin\u0014\n                      Laden's family in the United States, Saudi \nofficials organized the evacuation of 24\u0014\n                      members almost overnight. The Saudis have \nlimited previous investigations into bin\u0014\n                      Laden's crimes and have refused to freeze his \nassets after the latest atrocity. They\u0014\n                      have refused to cooperate fully in the \ninvestigation of the hijackers, at least 10 of\u0014\n                      whom were Saudi citizens and six of whom got \ntheir visas there. The Saudis, along\u0014\n                      with Egypt, even refuse to provide Washington \nwith lists of passengers on flights to\u0014\n                      the United States, even though most of the \nworld's airlines furnish that information. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Saudi Arabia has provided money, religious \nteachers, schools, and even diplomats \u0014\n                      to\u0014\n                      help the Taliban control Afghanistan, even as \nbin Laden was insinuating himself into\u0014\n                      the fabric of the regime. In Pakistan, Saudi \nArabia has been the principal sponsor of\u0014\n                      the Muslim fundamentalist \"schools\" that \nprovide the foot soldiers for bin Laden's\u0014\n                      terrorist network. These are not schools as we \nunderstand them. They are\u0014\n                      brainwashing centers, closingnot openingdoors \nto enlightenment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The long U.S.-Saudi relationship based on oil, \nmoney, and personal ties with the\u0014\n                      highest political echelons has made it possible \nfor the kingdom to escape U.S. \u0014\n                      criticism\u0014\n                      for its corruption, totalitarianism, and \nviolations of human rights. The suppression of\u0014\n                      economic and political modernization at home, \ncombined with an extremist religious\u0014\n                      ideology that promises salvation through a \nstruggle with the West, has produced\u0014\n                      thousands of young people who buy the thesis of \na clash of civilizations between\u0014\n                      Islam and the West. As Osama bin Laden put it, \n\"The world is divided into two sides . .\u0014\n                      . the side of faith and the side of the \ninfidel.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Saudi Arabia isn't the only country in our \ncoalition that relies on oppression and\u0014\n                      corruption. Take Egypt, a country we have given \n$50 billion in aid over the past 25\u0014\n                      years. It sponsors an unending flow of vitriol \nand anti-U.S., anti-Israel bigotry from its\u0014\n                      universities, mosques, and government-supported \nmedia. Along with Algeria and\u0014\n                      Tunisia, Egypt forced Islamic extremists out of \ntheir homelands, and many have \u0014\n                      turned\u0014\n                      up in the West where, as Fouad Ajami put it, \n\"they found fertile ground . . . with money\u0014\n                      and freedom to move about.\" Bin Laden has \noffered \"this breed of unsettled men,\" in\u0014\n                      Ajami's memorable phrase, \"a theology of holy \nterror and the means to live the \u0014\n                      plotters' life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The plotters have three goals. The first is \ndestabilizing Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The\u0014\n                      second is lending support to Iraq, and the \nlast, the extermination of Israel. All three,\u0014\n                      obviously, are intimately bound up with \nAmerica's role in the region, which is why the\u0014\n                      United States has become the lightning rod for \nextremist Muslim rage. Yes, bin \u0014\n                      Laden wants to push the clock back a few \ncenturies and create a theocratic \u0014\n                      dictatorship.\u0014\n                      That's key to understanding the roots of his \nhatred of America. It runs deeper than\u0014\n                      objections to our policies and presence in the \nMiddle East. It is hatred of \u0014\n                      modernityof\u0014\n                      all the elements of Western civilization. The \nMuslim extremists resent America \u0014\n                      because\u0014\n                      it has succeeded so dramatically in an era of \nmodernity and globalization. Israel is\u0014\n                      regarded with the same jealous fury, and would \nhave been so regarded even if it had\u0014\n                      been a Christian country with similar \nattributes of success. The neighboring Arab and\u0014\n                      Muslim states are almost all failed states with \naverage per capita incomes that run 5 \u0014\n                      to 10 percent of Israel's and are falling even \nfurther behind. Out of the same desert,\u0014\n                      Israel has created a modern, high-tech society, \nwith a thriving economy, a rich cultural\u0014\n                      life, and a healthy democracy. (The American \nadministration, in its pursuit of \u0014\n                      alliances,\u0014\n                      has unfortunately excluded Israel from any \npublic role in the global war against\u0014\n                      terrorism, despite Israel's longtime, \nfront-line fight against terrorism. Indeed, the \u0014\n                      State\u0014\n                      Department has compromised its integrity by not \nincluding Hamas, Hezbollah, and\u0014\n                      Islamic Jihad on the list of terrorist \norganizations and by suggesting that the terror\u0014\n                      against Israelis is not in the same category as \nthe terror against Americans, when all\u0014\n                      terror is equally evil.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Freedoms. Professor Bernard Lewis, the \npre-eminent historian of Islam, gives us the\u0014\n                      right perspective on the deep nature of the \npsychological struggle in which we are\u0014\n                      now engaged. In his discussion of the \nhistorical humiliations of the Muslims, he \u0014\n                      writes:\u0014\n                      \"In the last three centuries, the West has \ndominated and enfeebled the Islamic world,\u0014\n                      which previously had thought of itself as more \npowerful and more advanced\u0014\n                      economically and intellectually.\" So the Muslim \nsuffers \"the undermining of his     \u0014\n                      authority\u0014\n                      in his own country through the invasion of \nforeign ideas and laws, of ways of life . . .\u0014\n                      and finally the challenge to the mastery of his \nown house through emancipated\u0014\n                      women and rebellious children.\" They resent the \nfact that the ability of their traditional\u0014\n                      patriarchal societies to control their family \nand their clans was undermined by\u0014\n                      powerful outside influences, like social \nmobility and what we call freedom. President\u0014\n                      Bush put it well when he spoke to Congress: \n\"They hate what they see right here in\u0014\n                      this chamber, a democratically elected \ngovernment . . . They hate our freedoms, our\u0014\n                      freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our \nfreedom to vote and assemble and\u0014\n                      disagree with each other.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      America, then, has become the symbol of the \ndomination of the infidel over the true\u0014\n                      believers, crusaders to be expelled from \nIslamic holy places and Islamic lands, and \u0014\n                      to\u0014\n                      be attacked until their will is weakened, \nleading to their withdrawal from the Muslim\u0014\n                      world. Their terrorists' hope is that the \nregimes in Cairo and Riyadh would fail if only\u0014\n                      the Americans were made to leave. So they \nattacked the American presence in the\u0014\n                      gulf when they blew up the USS Cole and \nattacked the American alliance with Saudi\u0014\n                      Arabia when they destroyed American military \nbarracks. When neither earned the\u0014\n                      appropriate retaliation from the United States, \nthey were emboldened to attack \u0014\n                      America\u0014\n                      more directly. Why? To avenge the historical \nhumiliation of having been overtaken \u0014\n                      and\u0014\n                      overwhelmed by those they regard as inferiors. \nThese extremists listen to those who\u0014\n                      say the old Islamic ways were best, that they \nshould return to the true path of God to\u0014\n                      recover their dignity and their honor. But \ntheir resorting to violence represents a tragic\u0014\n                      misapprehension of that message.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Terror and joy. President Bush and his aides \nhave made it clear that the coalition\u0014\n                      they are forming is against terrorism and not \nagainst Muslims and Arabs. That's why\u0014\n                      they have courted the leaders of Egypt, Saudi \nArabia, Syria, and even Yasser Arafat.\u0014\n                      But they are, in Fouad Ajami's words, \"allies \nin the shadows, but in broad daylight the\u0014\n                      rulers will for the most part keep their \ndistance,\" because they know that in their\u0014\n                      streets, anti-Americanism is running rampant \nand the terrorist attacks on America \u0014\n                      have\u0014\n                      brought satisfaction, even joy. Which is \nprecisely why Arafat shut down the media\u0014\n                      that took video pictures of the Palestinians \nexulting and dancing on September 11. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While America must be prudent about these \nalliances, they are perfectly legitimate to\u0014\n                      embrace for the moment. After the Nazis invaded \nthe Soviet Union, Winston Churchill,\u0014\n                      that arch-anti-Bolshevist, quipped that if \nHitler invaded Hell, he would at least make a\u0014\n                      favorable reference to the devil. But we must \nall remember that if we sup with the\u0014\n                      devil, we should use a long spoon. These \nalliances should not be structured in a way\u0014\n                      as to preclude the United States from going \nafter the terrorist networks in these other\u0014\n                      countries, once we get rid of the al Qaeda \nnetwork, which must be our first priority.\u0014\n                      But these countries will have to be reviewed \ncarefully and continuously to see if they\u0014\n                      understand the need to draw the line between \nthe terrorist and those who harbor\u0014\n                      them, and the rest of the world. In the \ninterim, Washington must be unrelenting in its\u0014\n                      pressure if these states continue to nurture \nterrorism and foment anti-American\u0014\n                      violence. Sooner or later, America will have to \ndo what Rudy Giuliani did in New York,\u0014\n                      that is, label those countries and their \nleaders for what they really are, and respond\u0014\n                      accordingly with decisive action. As with the \noverwhelmingly positive response to\u0014\n                      Giuliani's decision to hand back the check to \nthe Saudi prince, America will respond \u0014\n                      to\u0014\n                      strong and clear leadership that rejects \ncompromise with terrorism anywhere,\u0014\n                      including those who try to rationalize their \nterror. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lastly, we should encourage our leaders to take \nmore firm and imaginative action to\u0014\n                      protect the nation. Partisanship has reared its \nhead again in Congress over\u0014\n                      federalizing air security. Tom Ridge, our new \nhomeland protection czar, has been\u0014\n                      given too few powers. Enough! What we need now \nis the kind of clear-sighted vision\u0014\n                      displayed by Giuliani at what is obviously just \nthe beginning of a long national \u0014\n                      struggle. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n10/29/01\u0014",

    "title": "GEORGE W. BUSH'S SPIRITUAL LIFE",
    "words": "OUR PRESIDENT, OF THE UNITED STATES \nOF AMERICA!\u0014\n                                         By Judy Keen, USA TODAY   \n-     WASHINGTON:\u0014\n\u0014\n      After President Bush met with Macedonian President Boris \nTrajkovski in the White House this month, Bush invited his guest into \nhis private study.  There, the two men knelt side by side in silent \nprayer. White House aides didn't mention that devotional interlude \nwhen they described\u0014\nTrajkovski's visit May 2 to reporters, and they were displeased to \nlearn that the private moment was about to become public.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Religion infuses the president's daily life. Bush, 54, starts \nevery day on his knees, praying. He reads the Bible each morning and \nstudies a daily Bible lesson. He often asks a Cabinet secretary to \nlead a prayer at the beginning of Cabinet meetings. He says he \nfrequently prays in the Oval Office. He sometimes prays on the phone \nwith a minister friend who lives in Houston.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Bush's family, friends and longtime aides say faith helped him \nquit drinking, find his vocation in politics and check his fiery \ntemper. He says it has made him more humble and tolerant. \"I find \ngreat comfort in my faith,\" he told Fox News last month. \"It helps me \nrealize that I am a person that has a lot of responsibility, but I am \njust a person, nothing more than a human being who seeks redemption, \nsolace, and strength through something greater than me.\" Overt \nexpressions of faith by elected leaders can make some Americans \nuncomfortable. Some employees at the Justice Department say the daily \nprayer sessions there, led by Attorney General John\u0014\nAshcroft, make them feel they might be expected to participate. \nBush's appeals to the religious right during his campaign made some \npeople wary of his links to groups such as the Christian Coalition \nand their socially conservative agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Americans want a president to have a private, individual \nfaith,\" says  Philip Goff, director of the Center for the Study of \nReligion and American Culture at Indiana University, Purdue \nUniversity in Indianapolis. \"What most  Americans are uncomfortable \nwith is the institutions of CHURCH, leave the state out of it. Those \npeople are called SINNERS!\" Religion has been\u0014\ncentral to Bush's life since 1985, when he had a pivotal conversation \nwith Rev. Billy Graham. At the time, Bush was in his late 30s, \nhard-partying and unfocused . He did not take his religion seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Billy Graham questioned him about his commitment to his faith, \nBush wrote in his autobiography, \"A Charge to Keep\", and \"God planted \nthe seed of faith in my heart. It was the beginning of a new walk \nwhere I would recommit my heart to Jesus Christ.\" I was bought with a \nprice, Jesus Paid The Price!\u0014\n\u0014\n      He was raised an Episcopalian but became a Methodist when he \ngot married and joined the church of his wife, Laura. He spoke of his \nbeliefs often during the campaign and said at his inauguration, \"We \nare guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in \nhis image.\" Bush isn't reluctant to describe his active faith. \"I \npray all the time,\" he\u0014\nsaid in the Fox News interview. \"When I am alone in the Oval Office \n(and) something might be on my mind, I will pray. I don't think that \nI could be sitting here as comfortable as I am and as peaceful as I \nam had it not been for my religion.\" Bush's prayers in the Oval \nOffice are usually\u0014\nsolitary. But Trajkovski, like Bush, is a Methodist. The Macedonian \npresident is also a lay minister. Before the visit, Trajkovski's \nstaff suggested to White House aides that he would welcome a chance \nto pray with Bush. When Trajkovski entered the Oval Office for the \nformal\u0014\nmeeting, Bush recognized a pin on his lapel. It was the emblem of the \nUnited Methodist Church, a cross and a flame signifying the Holy \nSpirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n       After their official conversation, Bush invited Trajkovski to \njoin him in prayer. Bush's frequent references to God and his faith \nmake Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for \nSeparation of Church and State, cringe. \"When a president wears his \nreligion on his sleeve as visibly as this one does, he isn't simply \nusing the bully pulpit to speak his mind,\" Lynn says. \"He's trying to \nimpose his religious views on other people.\" Some critics thought \nPresident Bush exploited religion during the primary-election \ncampaign. To build support among traditional Republican voters before \na hard fought South Carolina primary, he visited\u0014\nBob Jones University, an evangelical school in Greenville that banned \ninterracial dating and whose founder called Catholicism a cult. \nAnother time, in a debate, he was asked what political philosopher or \nthinker he most identified with. He answered simply, \"Christ because \nHe changed my heart.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Since taking office, President Bush has met often with clerics, \nincluding Catholic bishops and African American Ministers, at the \nWhite House and while traveling. When U.S. Military personnel were \nbeing detained in China last month, he asked American officials to be \nsure they had Bibles if they wanted them. He has proposed that \nreligious groups operate some federal programs the needy. \"Jesus \nsaid, 'To Keep your piety in private,' \" says Martin Marty, a \nreligious historian. \"People like the notion that piety shapes a \npresident's morality, but they know that policies backed by religion \nhave to be scrutinized more than others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      Kirbyjon Caldwell is senior pastor at Windsor Village United \nMethodist Church in Houston and a Bush friend who sometimes prays \nwith the President over the phone. Caldwel says Bush's faith is such \na significant part of his life that he can't help but talk about it. \n\"The President's faith is extraordinarily important to him, not just \nfor spiritual reasons but for professional, emotional, social and \nfamily reasons,\" Caldwell says. \"The president allows his faith to \npermeate his entire being. He does not keep his faith in a box and \nopen it when he is in trouble\"\u0014\n\u0014\n       However, He doesn't impose it on anybody, his aides say. They \nsee his expressions of faith as one key to his character. \"I find it \nvery welcoming\" says press secretary Ari Fleischer, who is Jewish. \n\"It's a reminder for everyone about the importance of faith in our \nlives, and the\u0014\nPresident practices his so powerfully and so privately that it serves \nas a simple reminder of the American tradition of having a strong \nfaith In Christ Jesus.\" President Bush often attends church on \nSundays, including services in the chapel at Camp David, Md., the \nPresidential retreat, but\u0014\nhe has not joined a church in Washington. Other presidents have had \ndeep religious convictions. \u0014\n\u0014\n       During his presidency, President Jimmy Carter, a Baptist, \ntaught Sunday school. Richard Nixon, a Quaker, invited evangelists to \nthe White House. Abraham Lincoln never joined a church but rarely \ngave a speech without references to Jesus Christ. John Adams, a\u0014\nUnitarian, studied for the ministry before becoming a lawyer. \nPresident Bush has said he doesn't think of himself as an advocate \nfor his religion, but he doesn't intend to hide his faith. \"I am, a \nlowly sinner who is saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, sought \nredemption\u0014\nand found\" he told USA TODAY in January. \"That doesn't make me better \nthan anybody, it just adds perspective, I hope. I think people are \ngoing to find that in tough times, they're going to see a steady hand \nbecause the rock on which I stand is something other than the moment, \nthe emotion of the day. Faith can be a steadying influence.\"\u0014",

    "title": "GEORGE HARRISON, BEATLE, IS DEAD OF CANCER",
    "words": "Friday, Nov. 30, 2001 \u0014\n\u0014\n          Starr: Harrison Was Best Friend \u0014\n\u0014\n          LOS ANGELES (AP) - George Harrison, the ``quiet Beatle'' \nwho added both rock 'n' roll flash and a touch of\u0014\n          the mystic to the band's timeless magic, has died. He was \n58.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison died at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at a friend's Los \nAngeles home following a battle with cancer,\u0014\n          longtime friend Gavin De Becker told The Associated Press \nlate Thursday. Harrison's wife, Olivia Harrison,\u0014\n          and son, Dhani, 24, were with him.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``He left this world as he lived in it, conscious of God, \nfearless of death, and at peace, surrounded by family\u0014\n          and friends,'' the Harrison family said in a statement. \n``He often said, 'Everything else can wait but the\u0014\n          search for God cannot wait, and love one another.'''\u0014\n\u0014\n          With the death of Harrison, the band's lead guitarist, \nthere remain two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney\u0014\n          and Ringo Starr. John Lennon was shot to death by a \nderanged fan in 1980.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I am devastated and very, very sad,'' McCartney told \nreporters outside his London home Friday. ``He was\u0014\n          a lovely guy and a very brave man and had a wonderful sense \nof humor. He is really just my baby brother.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          In a statement, Starr said: ``George was a best friend of \nmine. I loved him very much and I will miss him\u0014\n          greatly. Both (wife) Barbara and I send our love and light \nto Olivia and Dhani. We will miss George for his\u0014\n          sense of love, his sense of music and his sense of \nlaughter.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          It wasn't immediately known if there would be a public \nfuneral for Harrison. A private ceremony had already\u0014\n          taken place, De Becker said. He wouldn't release details.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In 1998, Harrison, who was once a heavy smoker, disclosed \nthat he had been treated for throat cancer. ``It\u0014\n          reminds you that anything can happen,'' he said at the \ntime. The following year, Harrison survived an attack\u0014\n          by an intruder who stabbed him several times. In July 2001, \nhe released a statement asking fans not to\u0014\n          worry about reports that he was still battling cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Beatles were four distinct personalities joined as a \nsingular force in the rebellious 1960s, influencing\u0014\n          everything from hair styles to music. Whether dropping \nacid, exploring Eastern mysticism, proclaiming ``All\u0014\n          You Need is Love,'' or sending up the squares in the film \n``A Hard Day's Night,'' the Beatles inspired\u0014\n          millions.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison's guitar work, modeled on Chuck Berry and Carl \nPerkins among others, was essential.\u0014\n\u0014\n          He often blended with the band's joyous sound, but also \nrocked out wildly on ``Long Tall Sally'' and turned\u0014\n          slow and dreamy on ``Something.'' His jangly 12-string \nRickenbacker was featured in ``A Hard Day's\u0014\n          Night.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          They had their first No. 1 hit single in England, ``Please \nPlease Me,'' in 1963 and conquered the United\u0014\n          States the following year through their appearances on \n``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' In 1999, a survey of\u0014\n          American journalists and scholars to find the century's top \nnews stories ranked the 1964 U.S. visit at No.\u0014\n          58.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Originally considered a teen fad in the U.S. press, they \neventually became the first rock group to get\u0014\n          serious critical attention. In 1965, Life magazine said \nmusical embellishments in their songs ``are so\u0014\n          adroitly done that musicologists openly wonder if the \nBritish lads know what on earth they are doing.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Although his songwriting was overshadowed by the great \nLennon-McCartney team, Harrison did contribute\u0014\n          such classics as ``Here Comes the Sun'' and ``Something.'' \nHarrison also taught the young Lennon how\u0014\n          to play the guitar.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``As he said himself, how do you compare with the genius of \nJohn and Paul? But he did, very well,'' rock\u0014\n          star and activist Bob Geldof told BBC radio.\u0014\n\u0014\n          His image as the ``quiet Beatle'' was summed up in the \nfirst song he wrote for the band, ``Don't Bother\u0014\n          Me,'' which appeared on the group's second album.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But Harrison also had a wry sense of humor that helped \nshape the Beatles' irreverent charm, memorably\u0014\n          fitting in alongside Lennon's cutting wit and Starr's \ncartoonish appeal.\u0014\n\u0014\n          At their first recording session under George Martin, the \nproducer reportedly asked the young musicians to\u0014\n          tell him if they didn't like anything. Harrison's response: \n``Well, first of all, I don't like your tie.'' Asked by a\u0014\n          reporter what he called the Beatles' famous moptop \nhairstyle, he quipped, ``Arthur.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          He always preferred being a musician to being a star, and \nhe soon soured on Beatlemania - the\u0014\n          screaming girls, the wild chases from limos to gigs and \nback to limos. Like Lennon, his memories of the\u0014\n          Beatles were often tempered by what he felt was lost in all \nthe madness.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``There was never anything, in any of the Beatle \nexperiences really, that good: even the best thrill soon got\u0014\n          tiring ...,'' Harrison wrote in his 1979 book, ``I, Me, \nMine.'' ``Your own space, man, it's so important. That's\u0014\n          why we were doomed, because we didn't have any. We were \nlike monkeys in a zoo.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Still, in a 1992 interview with The Daily Telegraph, \nHarrison confided: ``We had the time of our lives: We\u0014\n          laughed for years.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``George has given so much to us in his lifetime and \ncontinues to do so even after his passing, with his\u0014\n          music, his wit and his wisdom,'' Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, \nsaid Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\n          After the Beatles broke up in 1970, Harrison had sporadic \nsuccess. He organized the concert for\u0014\n          Bangladesh in New York, produced films that included Monty \nPython's ``Life of Brian'' and teamed with old\u0014\n          friends, including Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison, as ``The \nTraveling Wilburys.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison was born Feb. 25, 1943, in Liverpool, one of four \nchildren of Harold and Louise Harrison. His\u0014\n          father, a former ship's steward, became a bus conductor \nsoon after his marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison was 13 when he bought his first guitar and \nbefriended Paul at their school. McCartney introduced\u0014\n          him to Lennon, who had founded a band called the Quarry Men \n- Harrison was allowed to play if one of the\u0014\n          regulars didn't show up.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``When I joined, he didn't really know how to play the \nguitar; he had a little guitar with three strings on it that\u0014\n          looked like a banjo,'' Harrison once recalled of Lennon.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I put the six strings on and showed him all the chords - \nit was actually me who got him playing the guitar.\u0014\n          He didn't object to that, being taught by someone who was \nthe baby of the group. John and I had a very\u0014\n          good relationship from very early on.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison evolved as both musician and songwriter. He became \ninterested in the sitar while making the\u0014\n          1965 film ``Help!'' and introduced it to a generation of \nWestern listeners on ``Norwegian Wood,'' a song by\u0014\n          Lennon from the ``Rubber Soul'' album. He also began \ncontributing more of his own material.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Among his compositions were ``I Need You'' for the \nsoundtrack of ``Help''; ``If I Needed Someone'' on\u0014\n          ``Rubber Soul''; ``Taxman'' and ``Love You To'' on \n``Revolver''; ``Within You, Without You'' on ``Sgt. Pepper'';\u0014\n          and ``While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' on the White Album.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In 1966, he married model Patti Boyd, who had a bit part in \n``A Hard Day's Night.'' (They divorced in 1977,\u0014\n          and she married Harrison's friend, the guitarist Eric \nClapton. Harrison attended the wedding.)\u0014\n\u0014\n          More than any of the Beatles, Harrison craved a little \nquiet. Late in 1966, after the Beatles had ceased\u0014\n          touring, he went to India, where he studied the sitar with \nRavi Shankar.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In 1967, Harrison introduced the other Beatles to the \nteaching of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and all four\u0014\n          took up transcendental meditation. Harrison was the only \none who remained a follower.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``For every human there is a quest to find the answer to \nwhy am I here, who am I, where did I come from,\u0014\n          where am I going,'' he once said. ``For me that became the \nmost important thing in my life, everything else\u0014\n          is secondary.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          By the late '60s, Harrison was clearly worn out from being \na Beatle and openly bickered with McCartney,\u0014\n          arguing with him on camera during the filming of ``Let It \nBe.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          As the Beatles grew apart, Harrison collaborated with \nClapton on the song ``Badge,'' performed with\u0014\n          Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and produced his most acclaimed \nsolo work, the triple album ``All Things Must\u0014\n          Pass.'' The sheer volume of material on that 1970 release \nconfirmed the feelings of Harrison fans that he\u0014\n          was being stifled in the Beatles.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But one of those songs, the hit ``My Sweet Lord,'' later \ndrew Harrison into a lawsuit, which he lost, by the\u0014\n          copyright owner of ``He's So Fine.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Another Harrison project also led to legal problems. Moved \nby the starvation caused by the war between\u0014\n          Bangladesh and Pakistan, Harrison in 1971 staged two \nbenefit concerts at New York and recruited such\u0014\n          performers as Starr, Shankar, Clapton and Dylan.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Anticipating such later superstar benefits as Live Aid, the \nBangladesh concerts were also a cautionary tale\u0014\n          about counterculture bookkeeping. Although millions were \nraised and the three-record concert release\u0014\n          won a Grammy for album of the year, allegations emerged \nover mishandling of funds and the money long\u0014\n          stayed in escrow.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Despite the occasional hit single, including the Lennon \ntribute song ``All Those Years Ago,'' Harrison's\u0014\n          solo career did not live up to expectations. Reviewing a \ngreatest hits compilation, Village Voice critic Robert\u0014\n          Christgau likened him to a ``borderline hitter they can \npitch around after the sluggers (Lennon and\u0014\n          McCartney) are traded away.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Harrison's family life was steadier. He married Olivia \nArias in 1978, a month after Dhani was born.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The next year, Harrison founded Handmade Films to produce \nMonty Python's ``Life of Brian.'' He sold the\u0014\n          company for $8.5 million in 1994.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``George wasn't head in the clouds all the time. When it \ncame to business and all that he was feet very\u0014\n          much on the ground,'' Michael Palin of Monty Python's \nFlying Circus told BBC radio.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The dark side of fame continued to follow Harrison. In \n1999, he was stabbed several times by a man who\u0014\n          broke into his home west of London. The man, who thought \nthe Beatles were witches and believed\u0014\n          himself on a divine mission to kill Harrison, was acquitted \nby reason of insanity.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But success came the following year when the compilation of \nBeatles No. 1 singles, ``1,'' sold millions of\u0014\n          copies.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``The thing that pleases me the most about it is that young \npeople like it,'' Harrison said in an interview with\u0014\n          the AP. ``I think the popular music has gone truly weird. \nIt's either cutesy-wutesy or it's hard, nasty stuff. It's\u0014\n          good that this has life again with the youth.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          John Chambers, of the Liverpool Beatles Appreciation \nSociety, said Harrison's death was the end of an\u0014\n          era for Beatles fans.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``Until now there has always been the hope of a reunion, \nperhaps with Julian Lennon standing in for his\u0014\n          Dad,'' Chambers said. ``It really is the end of a dream.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          At Harrison's mansion near London, fans left bunches of \nroses and lilies. One note read: ``The world will\u0014\n          never be the same''; another said: ``The music, the rock \n'n' roll life you led won't be forgotten.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Fans in New York began gathering before dawn Friday at \nStrawberry Fields, a section of Central Park\u0014\n          created in memory of Lennon, who was shot outside his \napartment nearby.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I just decided to buy a bottle of wine and some roses at \nthe corner and head over here,'' said restaurateur\u0014\n          John Soler, 38.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Added Pete Degan, 42: ``It's a sad day for rock 'n' roll.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Associated Press Writers Robert Barr in London and Hillel \nItalie in New York contributed to this report.\u0014\n\u0014\n          On the Net:\u0014\n\u0014\n          http://www.beatles.com\u0014",

    "title": "GEORGE HARRISON: 1943-2001",
    "words": "Friday, Nov. 30, 2001\u0014\nGeorge Harrison: 1943-2001\u0014\nThe Beatles' lead guitarist left a lasting impression in the pages of \nTIME.\u0014\nChristopher John Farley remembers the quiet Beatle\u0014\nBY CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY\u0014\n\u0014\nThe devil took the first Beatle, and now God has taken another. When \nJohn\u0014\nLennon was murdered in 1980, it was a sad anomaly, the impossible-to- \npredict\u0014\nact of a madman. The death of George Harrison, 58, of cancer in Los \nAngeles\u0014\nthis week is something different. It's the sadly natural passing of a \nguiding spirit\u0014\nof the 60s and a prince of classic rock. \"All Things Must Pass,\" was \nthe title of\u0014\nHarrison's post-Beatles solo album in 1970. It could also be his \nepitaph. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the big picture it doesn't really matter if we never made a \nrecord or we never\u0014\nsang a song,\" Harrison once said. \"That isn't important. At death, \nyou're going\u0014\nto be needing some spiritual guidance and some kind of inner \nknowledge that\u0014\nextends beyond the boundaries of the physical world...it's what's \ninside that\u0014\ncounts. Some of the best songs that I know are the ones I haven't \nwritten yet\u0014\nand it doesn't even matter if I don't ever write them, because it's \nonly small\u0014\npotatoes compared with the big picture.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHarrison, first and foremost, will always be thought of as a member \nof the\u0014\nBeatles. He was their lead guitarist, \"the quiet Beatle,\" and a \nsometimes\u0014\nfrustrated songwriter suffering under the shadow of the great team of \nJohn\u0014\nLennon and Paul McCartney. Still, Harrison produced his share of \nclassic\u0014\nBeatle tunes, including \"Taxman,\" \"Here Comes the Sun,\" \"While My \nGuitar\u0014\nGently Weeps,\" and \"Something.\" Any single one of those songs would\u0014\nguarantee an artist immortality on VH1 and classic radio stations \nworldwide. \"I\u0014\nwouldn't say that my songs are autobiographical,\" Harrison said. \n\"Taxman' is\u0014\nperhaps. Some of them were later on, after the Beatles. The early \nones were\u0014\njust any words I could think of.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHarrison, besides being a member of the Beatles, was also a godfather \nof world\u0014\nmusic. By studying with Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar and playing \nthe sitar\u0014\nhimself on songs like \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"Within You Without You,\" \nhe\u0014\nhelped bring the sounds of the East into Western pop. Since Harrison, \npop\u0014\nmusicians ranging from Sting to David Byrne to Marc Anthony have felt \nfree to\u0014\nsample from music from around the world in their pop and it's partly \nbecause of\u0014\nthe barriers that Harrison broke down. For Harrison, combining \nmusical cultures\u0014\ncame naturally. Said Harrison: \"When I first consciously heard Indian \nmusic, it\u0014\nwas as if I already knew it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHarrison was also a godfather of the charity rock megaconcert. In \n1971, he\u0014\nsponsored and hosted two major concerts at Madison Square Garden to \nhelp\u0014\nraise money for the the people of Bangladesh (the events later became \na\u0014\ndocumentary film and a Grammy-winning three-record set). The \"Concert \nfor\u0014\nBangla Desh\" was the spiritual precursor to 1985's Live Aid, the \nvarious 911\u0014\nrelief concerts that have been staged recently and many other charity\u0014\nmegaconcerts that have been held over the years. Harrison helped \npopularize\u0014\nthe melding of charity, global awareness and rock music. He may have \nbeen\u0014\nthe quiet Beatle, but he was never afraid to sound off on social \nissues that\u0014\nconcerned him. His take on gun control? \"If everybody who had a gun \njust shot\u0014\nthemselves there wouldn't be a problem.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHarrison's greatest accomplishment, however, was showing the world \nhow to be\u0014\npart of a band. Lead guitarists are often judged by their solos and \ntheir flashy\u0014\nonstage antics. The Beatles were a real band, with each contributing \nto the\u0014\nwhole. Harrison, between \"All Things Must Pass,\" his work with the \nTraveling\u0014\nWilburys and his work as a film producer (\"Time Bandits\" and \"Monty \nPython's\u0014\nLife of Brian\") had a solid solo career, but his best work was still \nwas the\u0014\nBeatles. The same is true of John Lennon, Paul McCartney  they were \ngood,\u0014\nsometimes even great, solo, but they were best when they were all \ntogether\u0014\n(and Ringo, of course, was definitely more interesting as a Beatle). \nAnd isn't\u0014\nthat what being in a band is all about? Heck, isn't that what living \nin a society is\u0014\nall about? There's something inspiring in the fact that even great \nartists can\u0014\nfind new inspiration in other people, that creativity isn't just an \nindividual act but\u0014\na collective expression. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere's something else inspiring in the fact that, as Harrison once \nsaid, the\u0014\nBeatles never really left us, so, following that reasoning, Harrison \nwill never\u0014\nreally leave us either. \"The Beatles can't ever really split up \nbecause as we\u0014\nsaid at the time we did split up, it doesn't really make any \ndifference,\" Harrison\u0014\nonce said. \"The music is there, the films are all there. Whatever we \ndid is still\u0014\nthere and always will be.\" All things must pass, but they don't pass \ncompletely\u0014\naway. The quiet Beatle, in one way or another, will always make \nhimself heard. \u0014\n\u0014\nTIME Music critic Christopher John Farley is the author of the \nforthcoming\u0014\nbook \"Aaliyah: More Than a Woman\"\u0014",

For \nthose who take the time to get\u0014\n            prepared, the winter season can be just a minor \ninconvenience. In recent years,\u0014\n            Virginians have dealt with snowdrifts, closed highways, \nfreezing temperatures and\u0014\n            prolonged power outages. This winter could offer more of \nthe same.\u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Regardless of where you live in Virginia, all citizens \nneed to be prepared for severe\u0014\n            winter weather,\" said Michael Cline, state coordinator \nfor the Virginia Department of\u0014\n            Emergency Management. \"Over the past several years, we \nhave seen severe snow and\u0014\n            ice storms that left thousands without power. These \nstorms remind us of the \u0014\n            importance of being self sufficient for several days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            The following tips can help you and your family get ready \nfor the winter months.\u0014\n\u0014\n            1. Stock an emergency supply of water and non-perishable \nfoods.\u0014\n\u0014\n            2. Make sure you have a flashlight, a battery-powered \nradio, spare batteries, a first-aid\u0014\n            kit and extra prescription medications.\u0014\n\u0014\n            3. Keep an adequate supply of fuel for your home. In case \nyou lose power, have an\u0014\n            alternate heat source such as a wood stove, fireplace or \nspace heater.\u0014\n\u0014\n            4. If you use a generator, make sure you connect it to \nthe item you want to power. \u0014\n            Dont connect the generator to your homes electrical \nsystem unless you consult a \u0014\n            certified electrician first. Remember to place the \ngenerator outside in a well-ventilated \u0014\n            area.\u0014\n\u0014\n            5. To prevent hypothermia, dress warmly. Several layers \nof lighter clothing or blankets\u0014\n            are better than a single, heavy layer. Wear a hat when \ngoing outside. Nearly half of\u0014\n            your bodys heat is lost through the head.\u0014\n\u0014\n            6. Check on elderly neighbors and relatives. The elderly \nare especially susceptible to\u0014\n            hypothermia -- even inside their homes. Make sure \nwalkways and sidewalks are clear.\u0014\n            Icy surfaces can be slippery and dangerous. \u0014\n\u0014\n            7. Be sure your car is in good running order. Have a \nmechanic check your battery,\u0014\n            antifreeze, wipers and thermostat. Make sure your tires \nhave good traction to drive in\u0014\n            snow.\u0014\n\u0014\n            8. Keep basic items in your car such as a windshield \nscraper, battery booster cables,\u0014\n            tow chain, bag of sand, blanket, flashlight, first-aid \nkit, road map and some\u0014\n            non-perishable food.\u0014\n\u0014\n            9. When severe winter weather threatens, stay at home \nunless you absolutely have to\u0014\n            drive.\u0014\n\u0014\n            10. If you get stranded in a snowstorm, stay in your car. \nDont seek shelter or a\u0014\n            telephone unless you see one close by. For heat, turn on \nthe car engine for brief\u0014\n            periods.\u0014\n\u0014\n            11. To keep water pipes from freezing, wrap them in pipe \ninsulation. During long cold\u0014\n            periods, allow each faucet to drip. This will help \nprevent the pipes from freezing.\u0014\n\u0014\n            12. Cold weather puts a strain on the heart, even without \nexertion. Be careful when\u0014\n            shoveling snow or pushing a car.\u0014",

    "words": "Some years ago the Raleigh, North Carolina News & Observer published \nan\u0014\narticle entitled: \"How Do You Measure Up As A Man? The article stated \nthat\u0014\nsome extensive research had been conducted on the 20th century \nstandards for\u0014\nmeasuring a man. The criteria were quite interesting and I thought \nthat I\u0014\nmight list them for the men here this morning just to see how they \nmeasure\u0014\nup.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. His ability to make and conserve money (That lets me out already).\u0014\n2. The cost, style and age of his car.\u0014\n3. (This is my favorite) How much hair he has.\u0014\n4. His strength and size.\u0014\n5. The job he holds and how successful he is at it.\u0014\n6. What sports he likes\u0014\n7. How many clubs he belongs to.\u0014\n8. His aggressiveness and reliability.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus Christ also once set down eight principles for the measure of a\u0014\nperson. His standards stand in stark contrast to the aforementioned. \nThere\u0014\nwould appear to be a wide gulf between the popular image of the \nsuccessful\u0014\nperson and what God sees as the successful person.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's what happened: Jesus had just started his ministry and was \ngaining in\u0014\npopularity. Large crowds were gathering. He had just picked out his\u0014\ndisciples. And in the quiet of the rolling grassy hills of northern \nIsrael\u0014\nby the Sea of Galilee, Jesus delivered a sermon to a multitude. Acres \nand\u0014\nacres of human faces. The crowd represented a cross section of \nhumanity.\u0014\nThere were rich and poor, young and old, doubtless varied races, \nthose who\u0014\nwere astute business men and those who were failures. In fact, the \ncrowd\u0014\nthat Jesus spoke to that day represented the world in miniature.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as different as they all were, Jesus understood that they were \nall on\u0014\nthe same quest. They were all after the same thing. They all wanted\u0014\nhappiness. Well, we are just like them aren't we? Isn't that what we \nwant\u0014\nfor ourselves. Isn't that what we ultimately want for our children:\u0014\nHappiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that we really don't grasp the true nature of \nhappiness, and\u0014\nbecause of that it so often seems to elude us. You see, we think that\u0014\nhappiness deals with our outer circumstances. We think that the truly \nhappy\u0014\nman is one who has achieved outer success. Thus our beatitudes read:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Blessed is the man who makes a fortune.\u0014\n2. Blessed is he who earns six figures.\u0014\n3. Happy is the man who has a palace in the city and a summer home in \nthe\u0014\nmountains.\u0014\n4. Blessed is he who has won the applause of his pears.\u0014\n5. Blessed is the woman who is recognized as a darling of society.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on this special day Jesus shared with disciples and, indeed, with \nall of\u0014\nhistory, that the concept of happiness is\u0014",

The propaganda\u0014\n                   machine created the climate of enthusiasm for \nHitler's achievements and a climate of\u0014\n                   indifference for his victims. With his propaganda, \nGoebbels made it possible for Hitler to\u0014\n                   assume a godlike position, and organize a \ngovernment based on coercion and threats.\u0014\n                   Goebbels orchestrated the jubilation for the \nFuhrers achievements, manipulated the German\u0014\n                   people to accept the persecution of the Jews, war \nreadiness, and accept with stoicism the\u0014\n                   destruction brought by he war.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   The process of extermination could proceed only by \ncreating two contradictory conditions, first\u0014\n                   the constant flow of anti- Semitic propaganda, \nneeded to neutralize the humane and cultural\u0014\n                   sentiments of the German population. The second \nrequirement was the maintenance of\u0014\n                   complete silence as to the fate of the victims and \nthe brutality of the extermination process.\u0014\n                   The silence was needed to deny the Allies an \nopportunity to unfavorable propaganda, and to\u0014\n                   avoid the warning of the victims. Both those \nconditions were effectively created by Goebbels\u0014\n                   propaganda machine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897, as a \ncrippled child with a club foot, an unusually\u0014\n                   bright child that grew up despised, ridiculed and \njeered by his healthy peers. He was a\u0014\n                   withdrawn estranged child, hating and despising \neverybody, finding his solace in the world of\u0014\n                   books. Goebbels was intelligent bright, well read, \nbut feeling rejected he developed a strong\u0014\n                   need to succeed, to gain acceptance, recognition \nand admiration, to raise above the masses.\u0014\n                   At one time Goebbels considered becoming a priest, \nbut was rejected after the interviewing\u0014\n                   priest came to the conclusion that he doesn't \nbelieve in God. Goebbels volunteered to active\u0014\n                   service during the World War I and after being \nrejected he went up studying in Heidelberg,\u0014\n                   where he invented a lie that he was wounded in the \nbattle of Verdun. The lie gained him\u0014\n                   acceptance and the much desired recognition, \npaving the way to the extensive use of lies in\u0014\n                   his propaganda work.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Goebbels openly admitted of being influenced by \nJewish authors, he admired the poetry of\u0014\n                   Heinrich Heine, he was not an convinced \nanti-Semites and he did not believe in the necessity\u0014\n                   of persecuting the Jews. Nevertheless he initiated \nburning of their books and created and\u0014\n                   unleashed a powerful propaganda machine for the \nsake of his career. Goebbels had unlimited\u0014\n                   ambitions but no moral restrains. \" Conscience\" \nGoebbels said \"is nothing more than a crutch\u0014\n                   for cowards\". Goebbels was cynic who did not \nbelieve in Nazism, but espoused the creed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Goebbels played a tremendous role in popularizing \nthe Nazi ideas, before the Nazis came to\u0014\n                   power by playing the masses, ridiculing and \nattacking the opponents. He was a fantastic\u0014\n                   demagogue telling the masses what they wanted to \nhear, hammering his own ideas into their\u0014\n                   hearts and heads. Goebbels said:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"There is no need to argue with the masses, \nslogans are much more effective.\u0014\n                        Slogans are like strong drinks to people. The \ncrowd doesn't react like men but\u0014\n                        like women, who rely on their feelings, \nrather on their intelligence, if any.\u0014\n                        Propaganda is a great, difficult and noble \nart, therefore it calls for a genius. The\u0014\n                        most successful propagandist in history were \nChrist, Mohammed and Buddha.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   After the Nazi gained power in 1933, Goebbels had \nto curb his is attacks, his former enemies\u0014\n                   were out of power, and the arrogant Nazi leaders \ncould not be criticized. Goebbels was a\u0014\n                   nihilist that loved to lash out at the dilettante \nrulers, and was frustrated by this imposed\u0014\n                   silence. The Jews were the only target available \nfor his sharp tongue, and Goebbels enjoyed\u0014\n                   having a convenient target.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Goebbels did not believe in all the lies he spread \nso successfully.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"The longer and more prominently he was \nactive in the Party, the more he held\u0014\n                        back his own personal views and convictions. \nHe deliberately rejected any\u0014\n                        disturbing intrusion of his own judgement \nruthlessly promoting the line Hitler laid\u0014\n                        down. His success as a propagandist was \ntherefore all the more overwhelming in\u0014\n                        that he himself did not believe all that his \neloquence and ingenuity hammered into\u0014\n                        the masses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   As the barbarous killing proceeded, it was \nGoebbels propaganda that had to neutralize it\u0014\n                   effect of the German people . Although most of the \nkilling was done in secrecy on Polish\u0014\n                   territory, it was not done without the knowledge \nof a large chunk of the German people, the\u0014\n                   soldiers on the eastern front witnessed the \nkilling, some even participated; the German\u0014\n                   residing in Poland were intimately familiar with \nthe fate of the Jewish population, the killings\u0014\n                   were not done in a vacuum. The Germans were well \nprepared to accept those atrocities by the\u0014\n                   extensive propaganda machine, created and managed \nby German Propaganda minister\u0014\n                   Goebbels.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In his Diaries Goebbels wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"The Fuhrer attaches great importance to a \npowerful anti-Semitic propaganda.\u0014\n                        He, too, regards success as depending upon \nconstant repetition. He is immensely\u0014\n                        pleased with our sharpening up the \nanti-Semitic propaganda in the press and in\u0014\n                        the radio.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In November 1942, when the process of killing was \nin full swing Goebbels published and\u0014\n                   broadcasted a piece of propaganda, entitled \"The \nJews are Guilty\". The Jews were cast in the\u0014\n                   role of scapegoat:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"The historical quilt of world Jewry on the \noutbreak and expansion of this war is so\u0014\n                        amply proved that is not necessary to loose \nanother word over it. The Jews\u0014\n                        wanted this war and they have it now. But \nthey must also keep in mind the\u0014\n                        prophecy of the Fuhrer of January 30, \n1939-the outcome will not be the victory of\u0014\n                        Jewry, but the extermination of the Jewish \nrace in Europe. We now see the\u0014\n                        fulfillment of this prophecy. Pity, to say \nnothing of sympathy, is entirely\u0014\n                        inappropriate. We must win this war against \nthe Jews. Should we lose it, then the\u0014\n                        harmless-appearing Jewish good fellows would \nexact on our people, women and\u0014\n                        children, a revenge for which history gives \nno precedence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Goebbels was very much aware of the barbarous acts \ncommitted by the Germans. In his diary\u0014\n                   he noted:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"Beginning with Lublin, the Jews in the \nGeneral Government are being evacuated\u0014\n                        eastward. The procedure is a pretty barbaric \none and not to be described here\u0014\n                        more definitely. Not much will remain of the \nJews. On the whole it can be said that\u0014\n                        about 60 per cent of them will have to be \nliquidated whereas only about 40\u0014\n                        percent can be used for forced labor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In one of his \"famous\" broadcast Goebbels declared:\u0014\n\u0014\n                        1. The Jews are our destruction. They \nprovoked and brought about this war.\u0014\n                        What they mean is to achieve by it is to \ndestroy the German state and the nation.\u0014\n                        This plan must be frustrated.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        2.There is no difference between Jew and Jew. \nEvery Jew is a sworn enemy of\u0014\n                        the German people. This plan has be \nfrustrated.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        3. Every German soldier's death in this war \nis the Jew's responsibility. They have\u0014\n                        it on the on their conscience, hence they \nmust pay for it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        4.The Jews are to blame for this war. The \ntreatment we give them does them no\u0014\n                        wrong. They have more than deserved it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   As all Hitler's henchmen Goebbels was driven by a \ncompulsive craving for power. \"\u0014\n                   Overshadowing all other characteristics was his \ninordinate ambition. Obsessed with ambition,\u0014\n                   he became a glutton for work-not because he was \noverconscientious, but because he was\u0014\n                   driven in by almost psychopathic lust for power.\" \nBoundless energy was directed to satisfy his\u0014\n                   ambitions, craving for social recognition and \nastounding vanity.\u0014",

    "words": "Finding Power in Submission \u0014\nTwo feminist scholars write about women you'll recognize. \u0014\nLauren F. Winner\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's Daughters: Evangelical Women and the Power of Submission\u0014\nBy R. Marie Griffith\u0014\nUniv. of California Press\u0014\n275 pp.; $24.95, hardcover \u0014\n\u0014\nGodly Women: Fundamentalism and Female Power\u0014\nBy Brenda E. Brasher\u0014\nRutgers Univ. Press\u0014\n217 pp.; $48, cloth, $19, paper \u0014\n\u0014\nThe evangelical women in Brenda E. Brasher's and R. Marie Griffith's \nrecent books are not the cookie-cutter stereotypes you are acquainted \nwith through the media, much recent scholarship, or the musings of \nAndrea Dworkin. They may instead be more like the women who sit next \nto you in church. For it is the goal of these books to challenge the \nflat clich of evangelical women as participants in their own \nunadulterated oppression. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese new studies argue that, contrary to popular perception, \nevangelical women can, as Brasher puts it, \"be powerful in a \nreligious cosmos generally conceded to be organized around their \ndisempowerment.\" Or, as the subtitle of Marie Griffith's book \nsuggests, there is power in submission. \u0014\n\u0014\nA colleague of mine recently complained that book reviews no longer \ndo what they are supposed to do: tell you whether or not you should \nread the book. In an attempt to redress her grievance, I will be \nblunt. You should read Marie Griffith's book. If you teach a course \non women's history or American religion, you should not only read \nGod's Daughters but add it to your syllabus immediately. If you are a \npastor, you should integrate Griffith's insights about prayer into \nyour next sermon. And if you are stumped when the next occasion for \ngift giving rolls around, consider this book: It is one of those rare \nreleases from an academic press that your sister or husband will \nenjoy reading in the bath or curling up with at night in bed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn God's Daughters, Griffith examines the numerous ways in which \nmembers of the Aglow fellowshipan interdenominational charismatic \nwomen's groupassert authority and exercise power even as they remain \ndevoted to a religion that propounds a conservative ideology of \ngender. It is a superb exploration not only of evangelicalism and \nwomen but also of prayer, therapy, family, and dieting (yes, \ndietingthe dieting section was in fact one of my favorites). \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a number of ways, God's Daughters is a model of ethnography done \nright. It has become a requirement that, rather than try to achieve \nan impossible objectivity, ethnographers \"situate\" themselves, \ntelling the reader up front what their own biases are and how these \nbiases constrain the story they can tell. In the first few pages, \nGriffith honestly informs the reader (as she informed the Aglow \nwomen) of her more liberal Christian affiliations, and she \nacknowledges that, as a committed feminist, her political and social \nviews differ markedly from those of most of her subjects. She even \nconsiders the way her age 25 when she began researchmight have \naffected her findings, given that the Aglow women she interviewed, on \naverage twice her age, often interacted with Griffith in \nmother-daughter mode. Furthermore, in her introduction Griffith \nelegantly and painlessly limns the anthropological, literary, and \npolitical theory that has influenced her work, rendering accessible \nideas that, in the hands of others, often appear abstruse and \nimpenetrable.\u0014\n \u0014\nGriffith also pulls off the rare feat of balancing ethnography with \nhistory. She places the Aglow movement in three different historical \ncontexts: the development of Pentecostalism in the twentieth century, \nthe therapeutic and recovery movement so pervasive in America today, \nand the changing understandings of women over the last hundred years. \nFurthermore, Griffith does not consider merely the Aglow women of the \n1990s. Rather, she traces Aglow from its inception in 1967 to the \npresent, showing that Aglow has changed over time in response to \nbroader cultural shifts. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Aglow members are frequently critical of the culture of \ntherapy in America, for example, Aglow has increasingly appropriated \nthe language of the recovery movement: while through the 1970s Aglow \nwomen and Aglow publications presented anger as \"a sin, pure and \nsimpleby the mid-eightiesspirit-filled writers were beginning to \ninterpret anger in increasingly therapeutic and sympathetic terms.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEssential to Griffith's overall argument is the changing \nunderstanding of submission among Aglow women. While the earliest \nAglow members trotted out Colossians 3:18 and Ephesians 5:22 to \nencourage wives to submit utterly to their husbands, by 1995, Aglow \nInternational President Jane Hansen condemned the message as a \ndistortion of the Bible and encouraged women and men to embrace \ninstead the doctrine of mutual submission. \u0014\n\u0014\nAglow has also modified its rhetoric to accommodate the fact that \nmost women now work outside of the home. A 1974 Aglow statement on \nhospitality said: \"Because we, as women, are the homemakers, we have \nthe blessing of opening our homes to God's people.\" By 1985, the \nreference to \"homemakers\" had been dropped. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe only disappointment in God's Daughters is Griffith's somewhat \nanticlimactic concluding chapter. There she offers illuminating \ninsights into both evangelical women's attitudes toward feminism and \nfeminist women's attitudes toward evangelicalism. But she also spills \na great deal of ink calling for \"fresh ways to think about power and \nresistancethat would avoid the either/or perspective, by which \npractices are viewed as either opposing or conserving certain \nmeanings and values, but rather understand them as doing both, \nupholding power arrangements even while exposing them to unexpected \nchallenges.\" Over 20 years ago, historians of American slavery \npioneered exactly the type of analysis that Griffith calls for, and \nsuch an approach is now commonplace among feminist historians. Her \nvision of finding \"a way of transposing this bifurcation, so deeply \nembedded in American thought, between resistance and subordination,\" \nis not unique, but rather what Foucault and all the little Foucaults \nhave seen as central to their mission for the better part of three \ndecades. It is puzzling that Griffith ignores the rich \nhistoriographical precedents that have done no less than forge these \n\"fresh ways\" of thinking about power. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this is merely a quibble with a magnificent book. Although \nGriffith may disagree with many of the religious and political \ncommitments of her subjects, she never betrays any disdain for them. \nThis is a rare trait in ethnographies, and it is always what \nseparates the gold from the dross. Among studies of American \nChristians, only Randall Balmer's Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory and \nGrant Us Courage rival God's Daughters in this regard. Griffith \ntranscends the differences between herself and the Aglow women to \npresent a portrait of them that is both respectful and loving.\u0014\n \u0014\nRather than studying an all-women's parachurch organization, Brenda \nBrasher has written an ethnography of the women's ministries at two \nlarge, fundamentalist churches in Southern California \n(\"fundamentalist,\" incidentally, is her term, not mine, and I am not \nconvinced that she uses it appropriately). Like Griffith, Brasher \nargues that, contrary to what one might prima facie assume, women \nderive substantial power from their affiliation with evangelicalism. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough glossed in the media and much scholarship as \"anti-feminist\" \nand \"post-feminist,\" these women, Brasher finds, are ardently \ncommitted to many political issues that have been advanced by \nfeminist groups, such as paid maternity leave, marital rape laws, \nequal pay for men and women in the workplace, and ending domestic \nviolence. Furthermore, many women assume significant leadership roles \nin the women's ministries, and these leaders encourage other women to \nseize an active role in their families, telling women \"that they \ncould shape their husbands' actions and alterfamilial behaviors.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe conclusion that evangelical women can carve out power in an \noppressive atmosphere is all that Brasher's book and God's Daughters \nhave in common. In contrast to Griffith's rendering of Aglow members, \nBrasher's description of the women she studied is often \ncondescending. In her epilogue, for example, Brasher grapples with \nthe question of why women enter evangelical religious communities in \nthe first place, when there are so many other options that seem more \nwelcoming to women. In answering this question, Brasher gives neither \nwomen nor evangelicalism very much credit: \"With scant energy to \nexpend evaluating alternatives, women are likely to favor religious \nalternatives that offer readily accessible, easily grasped answers.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not only the women that Brasher speaks about with \ncondescension, but also the genuine power of belief. She seems uneasy \ndiscussing the transcendentwhich is not the best trait in a scholar \nof American religion. After much hemming and hawing about the role of \neconomics in dictating the religious choices of evangelicals, Brasher \nfinally asserts: \"I continue to think that the women and men involved \nin these congregations are motivated by something more than sheer \neconomic functionality.\" This statement is neither terribly generous \nnor terribly bold. While scholars must acknowledge that religion is a \ncomplex problematic of socioeconomics, politics, geography, and so \nforth, but our descriptions of people's religiosity must be tempered \nby a respect for people's faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Brasher and Griffith are both forthright about their \ncommitment to feminism, Brasher defines her primary mission as waging \n\"the ongoing battle against sexism.\" Griffith, on the other hand, \nsees her book as contributing to a different \"central feminist goal: \na heightened understanding of the 'other'read 'nonfeminist'women, \nwho challenge particular assumptions and contradictions within \nfeminist thought.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis subtle but critical difference in the authors' understandings of \nfeminism lies at the heart of any comparison of the two books. \nBrasher takes a heavy-handed normative stand throughout Godly Women \nand ultimately concludes that \"while I understand the pragmatic \ncompromises many of the women I came to know during this study made, \nI do not believe they are the best long-term strategies for women.\" \nGriffith may well share this view, but if she does, she kept it out \nof the pages of God's Daughters. \u0014\n\u0014\nBrasher's few references to herself as a \"liberal Christian\" and a \nfeminist in no way compare to Griffith's earnest self-reflection, and \nrather than clarifying the theory that underlies her work, Brasher \nmerely tosses around elusive jargon and self-consciously rephrases \nthe straightforward \"in more postmodernish terms.\" Brasher's \nhistorical lens is as narrow as Griffith's is wide. Beyond evincing \nfamiliarity with Betty DeBerg's and Margaret Lamberts Bendroth's \nimportant historical studies on evangelical women and gender, Brasher \nseems to have little interest in setting her ethnography in a wider \nhistorical frameworkdespite her claim to \"take seriously the \nhistorical contexts\" of her subjects. \u0014\n\u0014\nParticularly disappointing in this regard is Brasher's failure to \ndiscuss Aimee Semple McPherson. One of the two churches that Brasher \nstudied is a Foursquare Gospel church, and its current teachings \nabout women and gender certainly differ from the days of McPherson's \nministry. An examination of Foursquare Gospel churches' transition \nfrom their origins to their current commitment to \"male headship\" \nwould have been fascinating. Brasher, however, only mentions \nMcPherson once, in passing. \u0014\n\u0014\nMcPherson is alluded to a second time when Brasher quotes a female \ncongregant as saying, \"Some of the stances they've had in my tenure \nhere are very ironic to me, seeing that the Foursquare church was \nstarted by a woman. They didn't want to have women in positions of \nleadership like a minichurch shepherd. I thought, well, that's pretty \nweird, pretty ironic.\" It is intriguing that this congregant drew \nupon the historical roots of her church to criticize the current \n\"stances,\" but, as Brasher did not even comment on the congregant's \nreference to McPherson, she must not have found this topic worthy of \npursuit. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Brasher's purple prose rapidly becomes tiresome. In the \nfirst paragraph alone, we encounter such descriptions as \"Elaine \nsweated as she spoke with incredible intensity\" and \"her phrases \nrolled out like a warm, wet cloud that appeared to pull most of the \nwomen around me into a cosmos of religious significance.\" The cloud \nsimile is one of Brasher's favoriteswe also learn that \"As I \nconclude this storythe goals that inspired me to begin this research \nreconverge amid the lines of text like beckoning clouds.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout, Brasher's diction is sloppy. One of an increasing number \nof writers who delight in misusing the word \"paradox,\" she informs us \nthat \"the participation of contemporary women in North American \nconservative Protestant congregations presents a painful paradox to \nthose committed to egalitarian relations between the sexes.\" Oh? In \nfact, there is no paradox there, painful or otherwise: said \nparticipation may present Brasher and fellow travelers with a \nquandary, or a challenge; evangelical women may be for some a source \nof confusion, frustration, even anger; but they are not, in this \nregard, a paradox. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals owe Brenda Brasher and Marie Griffith a debt of thanks \nfor amending the pervasive stereotype of evangelical women and \nshowing, to borrow the title of Judith Stacey and Susan Elizabeth \nGerard's article on feminism and evangelicalism, that evangelical \nwomen are not doormats. But evangelical readers ought not come away \nfrom God's Daughters and Godly Women thinking that, because many \nwomen have asserted power and authority within the confines of male \nheadship, a broader critique of the gender roles in evangelicalism is \nto be dismissed. Although the women in these books are at ease with \nthe precarious balance they have struck between submission and \nsubversion, there are evangelical women and men for whom such a modus \nvivendi is insufficient. These are the evangelicals, represented in \nBrasher's and Griffith's studies no more than on the nightly news, \nwho share an unwavering commitment to egalitarianism, taking their \ncues less from Patricia Ireland than from the radical ethics of Jesus \nChrist, who taught, as Paul reminds us in Galatians 3:28, \"There can \nbe neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there \ncan be no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLauren F.

Gitre | posted 03/18/2002 \u0014\n\u0014\n                            Heaven Below: \u0014\n                            Early Pentecostalism and \u0014\n                            American Culture \u0014\n                            Grant Wacker \u0014\n                            Harvard, 364 pages, $35 \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Pentecostalism could use a PR makeover. Its \nimage has improved, but many\u0014\n people still think Pentecostals are peculiar, if not somehow \nsuspect. Let us forgo the tally of\u0014\n offenses, offenders, and epithetswe know them well enough. Besides, \nthe most egregious offenders may not care what others think. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       One person, however, does care about \nperceptions: Duke University religious\u0014\n studies scholar Grant Wacker. Raised in a Pentecostal home, this \nMethodist now has only one\u0014\n foot in the tent.  This is as much his story as it is theirs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       On American soil, the movement was born at \nCharles Parham's makeshift holiness\u0014\n Bible college in 1901. Only after the Azusa Street revival's \neruption in 1906, however, did\u0014\n Parham's theological  innovation reach a much wider audience. That \ninnovation was the belief that\u0014\n speaking in tongues (glossolalia) is the biblical evidence of Spirit \nbaptism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Theologically, early Pentecostals looked a lot \nlike other mainstream evangelicals.\u0014\n As a whole, they believed in most orthodox tenets of the faith, from \nthe Virgin Birth to the inspiration\u0014\n of Scripture.  Like more radical evangelicals, however, they did go \nfurther. For instance, they\u0014\n tended to treat  God's promise to heal like an ironclad contract. An \nespecially popular pastime was\u0014\n the detailed  ordering of very specific end-times events. Radical or \nnot, orthodox beliefs did not\u0014\n necessarily  lead to orthodox practices. The two words that most \nappropriately described\u0014\n Pentecostal meetings, says Wacker, are chaotic and deafening. It is \nhard to believe anyone\u0014\n would want to revisit a Pentecostal meeting, much less enlist. But \nthat is exactly what they did,\u0014\n from a diverse array of social, ethnic, cultural, and economic \nbackgrounds. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       To get at the heart of Pentecostalism, Wacker \navoids theology proper and instead\u0014\n listens to  conversations that took place around kitchen tables (a \npopular metaphor among\u0014\n scholars to explain \"lived religion\"). No early leader, it seems, \nwas excluded from those tables.\u0014\n And herein lies  the more interesting story. When listening closely, \nWacker uncovers what he\u0014\n believes to be the  kernel, the genius, of the movement: \nPentecostalism survived and flourished\u0014\n because it was able  to hold conflicting impulsesprimitivism and \npragmatism, idealism and realismin creative tension. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Few surpassed Pentecostals as primitivists. \nThey believed they had uncovered\u0014\n the earliest and  therefore purest (or \"primitive\") form of \nChristianity, as if 2,000 years of historical\u0014\n blunders and compromises had been swept aside. Where others had \nfailed, they would\u0014\n succeed. They now had direct access to God through the Spirit and \ndrank from the pure, unadulterated Word of God. This self-assurance \nled in many directions, including rigorous asceticism. But above all \nled to an uncompromising idealism. For some devotees, \"time itself \nseemed calibrated by divine rather than human standards.\" This was \nheaven below. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       When it came to getting business done, \nhowever, Wacker assures us, these were\u0014\n no \"bumpkins fumbling around in the modern world.\" No, these were \n\"strong, determined,\u0014\n clear-eyed leaders.\"  Indeed, these were revolutionaries with a \nmessage for the world and no time to\u0014\n spare. A hero to  many was Aimee Semple McPherson, who mastered the \nemerging world of\u0014\n Hollywood-infused pop culture. In one year alone, on a barnstorming \ntour she spoke to over 2 million\u0014\n people; that  translates into 2 percent of the country's population. \nA local pastor,\u0014\n denominational head, divine healer, itinerant evangelist, and radio \ncelebrity, Sister Aimee was the first woman own a radio operator's \nlicense. (Pentecostals embraced technology without batting an eye.)\u0014\n God did not care about the good old boys network, tradition, and \nconvention. God said, \"Go!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Debunking 'Disinherited' Myths \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Heaven Below, which covers the first 25 years \nof the movement's growth, is a\u0014\n cultural history. Wacker divides the book into conceptual \ncategories, analyzing, among other\u0014\n things, rhetoric, boundaries, authority, and cosmos. He serves them \nup in 15 lucid, meticulously\u0014\n researched chapters, all illustrated with lively anecdotes. He \nanswers such questions as these:\u0014\n What did Pentecostals think and say about war and society, kin and \nfoe? What were their\u0014\n customs? Their politics? What did they think of women in ministry? \nHow did preachers preach, and\u0014\n leaders lead? \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Tucked into this cultural history is social \nhistory. Who exactly were the early\u0014\n Pentecostals? Were they poor or rich, educated or illiterate? Where \ndid they fit into early 20th-century\u0014\n society, and what did they think about that status? Here Wacker \ntakes to task a common\u0014\n characterization of  early Pentecostals, one perpetuated not only in \npopular myth but also by some\u0014\n scholars. Robert  Mapes Anderson famously tagged Pentecostals \nAmerica's \"disinherited.\" The\u0014\n indictment could not  have been more damning, but it was difficult \nto gainsay Anderson's assessment. No one had so  thoroughly \nresearched the available recorduntil now. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Rather than being dispossessed, Pentecostals \nwere about as average as people\u0014\n come, which in this case is a compliment. For instance, though they \nmay not have been the most\u0014\n educated, by all accounts they were as educated as the average \ncitizen. Pentecostal churches\u0014\n were not, as is sometimes suggested, disproportionately populated by \nwomen and youth when\u0014\n compared to other evangelical churches. They worked as skilled and \nunskilled laborers, artisans,\u0014\n clerks, and,  occasionally, professionals. As Americans go, they \nwere \"remarkably\u0014\n unremarkable.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       With one foot still in the tent, Wacker \nchooses to accentuate the positive. He\u0014\n readily agrees that  Pentecostals said and did some outlandish \nthings. The list of activities and\u0014\n possessions forbidden or discouraged is remarkable: from bowling to \ncrossword puzzles to Christmas trees. But rather  than treating these \nas nave byproducts of biblical literalism, Wacker invokes a kinder, \ngentler pragmatism. In the modern world, discipline requires prudence \nand efficiency, and at this Pentecostals were experts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Glossolalia to the early Pentecostal was no \nmumbo-jumbo gibberish. It added to\u0014\n the faith a sense of authenticity; it was real and tangible, like \nthe miraculous healings. Any account\u0014\n of  Pentecostalism's genius that does not fully account for the \nimplications of\u0014\n charismatic phenomena will fail. What is lacking in Wacker's \nbeautifully constructed masterpiece is not only  thelogy, but also \nmuch of the explicitly religious experiences and ideas animating \nPentecostal \"culture.\"  Particularly in this case that omission makes \nthis movement all the more enigmatic.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       None of this should detract from the \nconsiderable feat Wacker has indeed\u0014\n accomplished. He has  written the cultural history of a movement \nthat shunned much of what was and is American culture. To their dying \nday they claimed heaven above, not America below, as\u0014\n their homeland.  Heaven Below is a valiantand successfulattempt to \nrescue early\u0014\n Pentecostalism from what E. P. Thompson called \"the enormous \ncondescension of posterity.\" No historian has done this more  \ngracefully than Wacker, whose heart has \"never left home.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Edward J.

    "words": "Gloomy Ezekiel was an epileptic, says doctor \u0014\n\u0014\nStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent\u0014\nThursday November 15, 2001\u0014\nThe Guardian \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophet Ezekiel, hitherto best known for his gloomy \nprognostications in one of the lengthiest and most obscurely-written \nbooks in the Bible, has been diagnosed as the first known epileptic. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhich is no mean feat for Eric Altschuler, a neuroscientist at the \nUniversity of California in San Diego, since not only does no one \nknow much about Ezekiel, who probably lived 600 years before the \nbirth of Christ, but there is also some doubt about how much of his \nbook he wrote himself. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr Altschuler, whose talk to a meeting of the San Diego Society for \nNeuroscience has found its way into New Scientist, claims that the \nprophet probably had a case of temporal lobe epilepsy. He suggests \nthat Ezekiel's symptoms in cluded frequent fainting spells, episodes \nof being unable to speak, aggression, delusions and pedantry.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe prophet probably also had a compulsive writing disorder, \nmedically known as hypergraphia, diagnosed by Dr Altshuler on the \ngrounds that the book of Ezekiel is the fourth longest in the Bible, \nonly a little shorter than Genesis - and that it rambles on a bit. \n\"It's impenetrable. He goes on and on,\" he said. Another sure sign, \napparently, is Ezekiel's aggressive religiosity, a trait not unknown \namong prophets. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr Altschuler argues that his diagnosis helps put the book in \nperspective and serves to suggest that epilepsy is genetic in origin: \n\"Once you appreciate that, you can see where he's coming from. If \nthere were no old cases we'd have to ask if there was something wrong \nin our environment.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe neuroscientist is becoming something of an expert at long range \ndiagnoses. Earlier this year, in the same magazine, he claimed that \nSamson may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder - which \nis probably what the Philistines thought when he pulled the temple \ndown on top of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as anyone really knows, Ezekiel was a member of a priestly \nfamily in Jerusalem, sent into exile in Babylon by King \nNebuchadnezzar about 597BC. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there he had a series of visions, not only of God descending in \na chariot, but also visions foreshadowing the destruction of \nJerusalem in 586. After that came true, he softened his tone a bit, \nand foresaw the restoration of the people to whom God would grant a \nnew heart and eternal bliss. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophet prophesied doom to foreign nations and the reunification \nof Israel, and he also included helpful building instructions for the \nreconstruction of the temple. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough his ramblings are still cited by some fundamentalist sects \nsuch as Jehovah's Witnesses, most scholars now regard the prophesies \nas de void of serious or applicable meaning. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, though Ezekiel may have supplied some of the inspiration, it is \nnow thought likely that much of his book was written by scribes 150 \nyears later, which may account for its rambling and repetitious \nnature. \u0014\n\u0014\nContemporaries ascribed Ezekiel's fainting fits and trances to a \ntouch of the divine hand - possibly a more charming if less prosaic \nexplanation than Dr Altschuler's.\u0014",

    "words": "God Bless, More or Less \u0014\nIrving Berlin's anthem captures America.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost immediately after Irving Berlin finished \"God Bless America,\" \non November 2, 1938, the song threatened to replace \"The \nStar-Spangled Banner\" as the country's top patriotic song. In recent \nweeks, \"God Bless America\" has once again become our unofficial \nnational anthem, sung on the Capitol steps, on the floor of the stock \nexchange, even during the seventh-inning stretch.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first glance, it seems strange that a song beginning with the \ncontentious word \"God\" can get broad and heartfelt endorsement in our \npluralistic society. Yet \"God Bless America\" is the ideal song of \nthis cultural moment for at least four reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. \"God Bless America\" isn't really about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe God in this song blesses and guides, and he has a special place \nin his heart for America. He makes no specific demands and picks no \nfavorites. That pretty well describes the deity of the American \nmajority. While 95 percent of Americans believe in God, according to \na 1997 Barna survey, 53 percent believe that all good people go to \nheaven, and fewer than half believe in moral absolutes. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering that Irving Berlin was a Jew who married a Roman Catholic \nand raised three daughters as Protestants, this lack of theological \nspecificity is understandable. Besides, Berlin originally wrote the \nsong for his World War I-era musical \"Yip, Yip, Yaphank,\" which was \nhardly the setting for doctrinal explication. (Berlin eventually \ndecided that \"God Bless America\" was too serious for the musical, so \nhe held it for 20 years.)\u0014\n\u0014\n2. \"God Bless America\" isn't about war.\u0014\nPresident Bush recently said, \"This nation is peaceful, but fierce \nwhen stirred to anger.\" Both qualities have been evident in our \nrhetoric and our foreign policy over the years, but most of our \npatriotic songs emphasize only the latter. \"The Star-Spangled \nBanner,\" a product of the War of 1812, has rockets glaring and bombs \nbursting. \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" written during the Civil \nWar, offers up grapes of wrath, a terrible swift sword, and that \npointed abolitionist reference, \"let us die to make men free.\" \"God \nBless the U.S.A.\" and \"The Marines Song\" cover similar ground. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow that actual bombs are bursting, however, Americans don't want to \nthink about them. They didn't want to think about war in 1938, \neither, when the United States was trying hard not to get pulled into \nWorld War II. Berlin (the songwriter, not the regime) understood \nthis. Even while the United States was engaged in the conflict, his \nsongsof which \"This Is the Army, Mr. Jones\" is the most \nfamousreflected the ambivalence about warfare that would intensify \nin Korea, Vietnam, and beyond. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. \"God Bless America\" isn't triumphalistic.\u0014\nThough over 90 percent of Americans think their country is the best \non earth, it's uncouth for them to come right out and say that. \nFortunately, \"God Bless America\" speaks only of the nation's \ntopography and its identity as \"home sweet home,\" not of manifest \ndestiny, political prowess, or the \"beacon on a hill\" mentality of \nthe Puritans and their heirs. By contrast \"America,\" the only other \nmajor patriotic song that doesn't dwell on war, starts with \"the \npilgrims' pride,\" extols the benefits of American education, gives a \nnod to the smiling \"stars of progress,\" and claims the \"birthright of \nour sires.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if \"God Bless America\" boasted as many verses (8) as \"America,\" \nBerlin probably would not have mentioned pilgrims or birthrights. \nBerlin, after all, was a poor immigrant from Russia. After his \nfather's early death, he literally sang for his supper on the streets \nof New York's Lower East Side. The United States was his beloved \nadopted home, as it is for millions today.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. \"God Bless America\" isn't about money.\u0014\nIn other years, the song of the American moment would be a product of \nHollywood or Madison Avenue, because commercialized entertainment is \none of our hottest exports. Even now, it's noteworthy that Berlin was \na popular balladeer instead of, say, an Episcopal Sunday-school \nadministrator (Francis Scott Key, \"Star-Spangled Banner\") or a \nUnitarian social reformer (Julia Ward Howe, \"Battle Hymn of the \nRepublic\"). \u0014\n\u0014\nThat said, at a time when Americans are amazing each otherand the \nworldwith their charitable donations, selfless service, and can-do \nspirit, \"God Bless America\" is especially appropriate. Berlin donated \nthe royalties of the song, worth millions, to the Boy and Girl \nScouts. He donated $10 million raised by the musical \"This Is the \nArmy, Mr. Jones\" to the Army Emergency Relief. For these and other \ncontributions he received the Army's Medal of Merit from President \nTruman in 1945, a Congressional Gold Medal from President Eisenhower \nin 1955, and the Freedom Medal from President Ford in 1977.\u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin died in 1989 at age 101. He surely would have been gratified \nto see the role \"God Bless America\" is playing in 2001. Christians \nseeking deep solace in this time of fear, however, would find greater \nblessings in songs with more God and less America. Civic \"religion\" \nonly goes so far.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman is managing editor of Christian History, and can be \nreached at cheditor@christiantytoday.com\u0014",

    "words": "God's Funeral\u0014\nWhat will keep faith from nearly disappearing in America?\u0014\nBy Philip Yancey | posted 09/03/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nHenri Nouwen wrote with melancholy about return visits to his boyhood \nhome in the Netherlands, where in one generation vibrant Catholicism \nhad faded into a quaint ritual. A few months before his death, he \nspoke to a paltry crowd of 36 students at the seminary he had \nattended, once bustling with hundreds of eager candidates for \npriesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nNouwen's own devout family had rejoiced in his choice of vocation, \nthough many in the family later lost interest. He was called on to \nchristen a niece or nephew, yet mostly as a cultural relic. \"I feel \nlike an entertainer who is far from entertaining,\" he said after one \nsuch event.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a recent visit to the Low Countries, I encountered many reminders \nof the decline in European faith. Dutch Christians told me that a \ncentury ago, 98 percent of Dutch people attended church regularly; \nwithin two generations the percentage fell into the low teens. Today \nit's under 10 percent. Almost half the church buildings in Holland \nhave been destroyed or converted into restaurants, art galleries, or \ncondominiums.\u0014\n\u0014\nI attended a vespers service in a Belgian church renowned for its \nstained glass. Ten of us sat under the high Gothic arches, my wife \nand I the only ones younger than 70. Outside, far more tourists were \ncomplaining about the sign announcing the church's closure to \ntourists during the service. For a majority of Europeans, the church \nseems wholly irrelevant.\u0014\n\u0014\nA German correspondent wrote me about Europeans' reaction to the \nWorld Trade Center attacks. American leaders called a National Day of \nPrayer, and ordinary citizens temporarily flooded churches and \npurchased Bibles in record numbers. Germans had no comparable \nresponse. Instead, on talk shows and editorial pages, they turned \nintrospective: Muslim fanatics are willing to die for their God; we \nno longer even believe in God. What do we have as an alternative?\u0014\n\u0014\nI sensed some of the same existential anxiety in the Netherlands, \nstill reeling from the assassination of a popular politician in May. \nRight wing and openly gay (not an oxymoron in the Netherlands), Pim \nFortuyn voiced alarmist concerns that many Europeans feel about \nimmigration. Muslims have a more pronounced and visible presence in \nWestern Europe than in the United States; xenophobic movements in \nGermany, Spain, and France have fed on the resulting anxieties.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy hosts in the Netherlands look to the United States as a model of a \nmodern nation that maintains a vital religious faith. Whenever I \nvisit Europe, though, and see the mostly hollow shells of the church, \nan institution that dominated the continent for 1,500 years, I wonder \nif the same pattern will play out in my homeland. Will the decline of \nfaith that A. N. Wilson, himself one of its symbols, documented in \nthe book God's Funeral occur in the United States?\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson writes, \"God's funeral was not, as many in the 19th century \nmight have thought, the end of a phase of human intellectual history. \nIt was the withdrawal of a great Love object.\" Wilson admits a deep \nloss in at least two areas. For the first time in history, many \npeople no longer feel the need to pray or worship. Also, uniquely, \nmany see no world of value outside themselves, no objective \ntranscendent truth. Human beings alone must define their values and \nmeaningand if the previous century offers any indication of the \nresult, we face a bleak future indeed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I have some hope that the United States will not go the way of \nWestern Europe. In the first place, we have strong seminaries and \nChristian colleges that engage secularism. Perhaps more important, \nthe American church has long been a mission-sending church. \n(Sometimes I wonder if God continues to bless our nation, despite its \ndecadence, for this reason alone.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Christians trained in Enlightenment reductionism can learn \nabout spiritual warfare firsthand on mission trips to South America. \nWe can learn about suffering from the church in China, about \npassionate evangelism from Africa, and about intercessory prayer from \nKorea. Just as nothing threatens my faith like a visit to the \nagnostic portions of Europe, nothing invigorates my faith more than a \nvisit to churches in non-Western countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we have not heard the last from the church in Europe either. \nI met with Paul Nouwen, Henri's younger brother. Paul told of sitting \nat Henri's funeral, after his unexpected death at 64 in 1996, and \nhearing people from many countries speak of Henri's influence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I realized that, compared to Henri, I have nothing,\" he said. \"And \nas I sat there listening, the difference became clearHenri had God. \nThat made all the difference.\" In a humble spirit, Paul Nouwen \nproceeded to tell of the changes he was making to better prepare for \nhis own death and to restore a relationship with the God whom his \nbrother knew so well. As his brother testified, Henri, who had lived \nas a missionary in North and South America, ended up as a missionary \nback in his heartsick homeland.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014\nSeptember 9, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 10, Page 88\u0014",

    "words": "Germ warfare is not a new concept. Armies have attempted to spread \ndisease among their enemies since the 15th century, when the Mongols \ncatapulted corpses infected with plague into Genoese settlements. \nBritish troops gave blankets infected with smallpox to Native \nAmerican tribes during the French and Indian War (1754-1763). It was \nnot until the 20th century, however, that germ warfare attracted \nwidespread interest--and fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorld War I, for example, is often associated with the use of \nchemical weapons (in the form of chlorine and mustard gas), but the \nGerman military also attempted to disrupt Allied transportation \ncapabilities by injecting the deadly bacterium anthrax into mules and \nhorses. Worldwide outrage prompted the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which \nbanned the use of chemical and biological weapons but allowed their \nresearch and production.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring World War II, the Japanese army subjected the people of \nManchuria to cruel germ warfare tests. Airplanes dropped 15 million \nplague-infested fleas on the cities of this Chinese province, and \nprisoners were intentionally infected with typhoid, cholera, \nsalmonella, and meningitis. At Nanking, Japanese soldiers handed out \nchocolate laced with anthrax to local children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1972, the world's superpowers had concluded that the prospect of \nreleasing deadly bacteria into the air--where they would be subject \nto the unpredictable forces of wind and weather--was simply too \nrisky. That year's Biological Weapons Convention banned the \ndevelopment and production of biological weapons, but not all \ncountries embraced the treaty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIraq, for one, threatened to use biological weapons during the Gulf \nWar (1990-1991), and the subsequent capture of Iraqi bombs and \nmissiles filled with anthrax and botulism proved Saddam Hussein could \nhave followed through on that threat. The fear of US nuclear \nretaliation may have deterred him from using these weapons, but their \nexistence confirmed that the possibility of germ warfare is no less \nlikely today than before the Biological Weapons Convention was signed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHBC FYI MILITARY HISTORY NEWSLETTER, 12/02\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

    "words": "GOD WINKS\u0014\n   by Joe McKeever, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   Late one night, Slim Cornett was being shown around a county\u0014\n   airport in rural Mississippi by a member of his church who\u0014\n   managed the facility. \"This switch lights up the runway,\" the\u0014\n   man said as he flipped it. \"Then, let's say there is a plane\u0014\n   in distress up there. I would throw this switch and turn on\u0014\n   the search lights.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   As the night skies lit up, a small plane materialized out of\u0014\n   the darkness and landed. Slim and his friend watched in\u0014\n   amazement as Franklin Graham, son of the famous evangelist,\u0014\n   stepped off the plane. The pilot had been flying Franklin back\u0014\n   to school in Texas when the electrical system shut down,\u0014\n   leaving them stranded in the Mississippi night without lights\u0014\n   or radio or any means of guidance. From out of nowhere, the\u0014\n   search beam had come on and guided them to the landing strip.\u0014\n\u0014\n   As Franklin's mother, Ruth, tells the story, earlier that\u0014\n   evening before they left home, Billy Graham had prayed for the\u0014\n   Father to protect and guide his son and the pilot.\u0014\n\u0014\n   It sure was lucky those men happened to be in the airport\u0014\n   after hours, wasn't it? And how coincidental that they turned\u0014\n   on the searchlight when they did. Yeah, right.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Someone has said a coincidence is God wishing to remain\u0014\n   anonymous. If so, it isn't working, because, far from\u0014\n   concealing Him, this kind of concurrence is a dead giveaway\u0014\n   that God is on the premises.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Squire Bushnell, a veteran television executive, has written a\u0014\n   book called \"When God Winks,\" in which he claims these\u0014\n   intersections of people and events are nudges from the Creator\u0014\n   reminding us we are not alone in life's adventures. It's a fun\u0014\n   book on an intriguing theme (although Christians may disagree\u0014\n   with some of Bushnell's conclusions). Two lovers discover\u0014\n   their grandfathers were best friends half a century earlier.\u0014\n   Does this guarantee the match is made in Heaven? Not to me, it\u0014\n   doesn't. Still, I love the concept of God signaling to us His\u0014\n   nearness by these tiny miracles.\u0014\n\u0014\n   My wife Margaret and I used to talk of having two children, \"a\u0014\n   boy for me and a girl for you.\" We had two boys, Joe Neil\u0014\n   Jr., and John Marshall, but no daughter. When the boys were 8\u0014\n   and 11, we adopted a five-year-old Korean daughter whose name\u0014\n   was Jin Ok. On the day we met her at the airport, someone told\u0014\n   us Jin Ok means \"real pearl.\" We began laughing. Margaret\u0014\n   comes from the Greek \"margaritas\" meaning \"pearl.\" We had our\u0014\n   daughter named for her mother. God was winking, and enjoying the\u0014\n   moment as much as we.\u0014\n\u0014\n   My friend Bryan saw God wink. Aboard a plane to Salt Lake\u0014\n   City, Bryan got acquainted with his seatmates, a mother and\u0014\n   her ten-year-old daughter. The lady found it intriguing that\u0014\n   Bryan was a minister and peppered him with questions.\u0014\n   Eventually, Bryan shared his story with her--of how Jesus\u0014\n   Christ had changed everything about his life--and ended up\u0014\n   praying with them both as they invited Jesus to become their\u0014\n   Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\n  That's when the lady told Bryan why they were headed for Utah.\u0014\n\u0014\n   She had been separated from her husband for two years due to\u0014\n   his drinking problem, but he had conquered the bottle and they\u0014\n   were going to try marriage again. \"He needs the Lord, too,\"\u0014\n   she said. \"When we get to Salt Lake City, would you mind\u0014\n   talking to him about this?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Bryan was more than willing. In the airport, they met the\u0014\n   husband and found out that minutes earlier, as he was waiting\u0014\n   for the plane, a furloughing missionary had sat down beside\u0014\n   him and led him to faith in Jesus Christ. God had arranged the\u0014\n   schedules of two ministers on opposite sides of the world to\u0014\n   get this family in the kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The story of Jesus' birth is lined with Heavenly coincidences.\u0014\n   A Roman census moves Joseph and Mary from Nazareth to\u0014\n   Bethlehem just in time to fulfull a 500-year-old prophecy that\u0014\n   the Messiah would be born there. Shepherds found the stall\u0014\n   where the Lord was born, and  breathlessly announced that they\u0014\n   had seen a skyful of angels proclaiming His birth. Foreigners\u0014\n   chasing a star showed up bearing gifts, gold among them, just\u0014\n   in time to finance the family's hasty flight to Egypt.\u0014\n\u0014\n   God was moving Heaven and earth to get you and me into the\u0014\n   Kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Gospel of Jesus Christ came together at a moment in time\u0014\n   when the Greek language and Roman highways and disillusionment\u0014\n   over the old religions flowed together to create an ideal\u0014\n   situation for spreading this message.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Coincidence? No, just a sovereign God on the job.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Joe McKeever is a cartoonist and pastor of First Baptist\u0014\n   Church of Kenner, Louisiana.\u0014",

We may even stop when it's yellow.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Our women hunt, fish, and drive trucks--because they want to.\u0014\nSo, you're a feminist. Isn't that cute.\u0014\n\u0014\n14. Yeah, we eat catfish. Carp, too--and turtle. You really want\u0014\nsushi and caviar? It's available at the bait shop.\u0014\n\u0014\n15. They are pigs. That's what they smell like. Get over it. Don't\u0014\nlike it? Interstates 70, 80, &90 go two ways--Interstates 29 &35 go\u0014\nthe other two. Pick one and use it accordingly.\u0014\n\u0014\n16. The \"Opener\" refers to the first day of deer season. It's a\u0014\nreligious holiday. You can get breakfast at the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. So every person in every pickup waves. It's called being\u0014\nfriendly. Understand the concept?\u0014\n\u0014\n18. Yeah, we have golf courses. Don't hit in the water hazard. It\u0014\nspooks the fish.\u0014\n\u0014\n19. That Highway Patrol Officer that just pulled you over for\u0014\ndriving like an idiot...his name is \"Sir\"...no matter how old he is.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, enjoy your visit.\u0014",

    "words": "Girl in Transplant Mix-Up Dies After Two Weeks\u0014\nBy RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD\u0014\n\u0014\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 22  A girl died today after two long weeks in \nwhich she received the wrong heart and lungs in one transplant \noperation and then suffered brain damage and complications after a \nrare second one. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl, Jsica Santilln, 17, a Mexican immigrant who came to \nAmerica three years ago seeking medical treatment for a \nlife-threatening heart condition, was declared dead at 1:25 p.m. at \nDuke University Hospital after tests performed today confirmed her \nbrain was not functioning, her family's lawyer said. Her heart \nstopped at 5:07. Doctors removed her from a respirator at 5:10 p.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Santilln's case drew wide attention. Pictures of the girl, \nbrown-eyed and smiling, adorned shops and restaurants. And \nwell-wishers worldwide sent greetings this month as her condition \nworsened, brightened and then finally darkened.\u0014\n\u0014\nAside from serving as an emotional touchstone, Ms. Santilln's plight \nunderscored a debate in medicine about the ethics of risky \nsecond-transplant operations at a time of grave shortages of human \norgans. It also tarnished to some degree the reputation of one of the \nnation's most renowned hospitals here in a town that calls itself the \n\"city of medicine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuke University Hospital has blamed human error and a lack of \nsafeguards at the hospital to ensure the transplant organs' blood \ntype matched the recipient's.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. James Jaggers, the transplant surgeon who made the error, \nreleased a statement last night saying: \"I am ultimately responsible \nfor the team and for this error. I personally told the Santilln \nfamily about the errors that were made and then tried to do \neverything medically possible to treat Jsica and try to save her \nlife.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hours after the girl was declared brain dead there was a brief \nflurry of effort to keep her on life support, a lawyer for the family \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe family, bitter at the hospital's acknowledged blood-type mistake \nin the transplant, had urged the hospital to keep her on life support \nuntil they got a second opinion. In a news conference this afternoon, \nKurt Dixon, the family's lawyer, said the hospital had denied the \nrequest but the family had looked into getting one.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Dixon said the hospital had informed the family that its doctors \nhad the right to disconnect her from life support, but he was \nconducting legal research challenging that view.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard A. Puff, a spokesman for Duke, said in an interview after \nJsica was removed from life support this evening that there was no \nsecond opinion given and none was refused. Mr. Puff said he could not \nconfirm whether one was requested. He said hospital doctors and \nadministrators were not available for comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Dixon said the family and Mac Mahoney, a family friend who has \nraised money for Ms. Santilln's care, would decline interviews for \nnow.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jesica's family and the family of Mac Mahoney are devastated by \nthese turns of events,\" Mr. Dixon said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors have acknowledged that during a Feb. 7 operation they gave \nMs. Santilln a heart-lung transplant with organs of the wrong blood \ntype. Ms. Santilln had type O blood; the organs were type A and her \nbody rejected them, sending her into a coma-like state.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Santilln had waited three years for the first transplant but a \nnew set of organs was found within days, which her supporters \nattribute to publicity of her condition. Duke officials said they \nworked through normal channels but they did not discount the power of \nwidespread attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second operation with the organs of the correct blood type was \nperformed Thursday but Ms. Santilln developed complications, \nincluding swelling of the brain and kidney failure. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is certainly not the way we like to see transplant stories \nend,\" Mr. Puff said. \"Most of them end happy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuke has put steps in place to prevent such mistakes from happening \nagain. Among other measures, three crucial members of the transplant \nteam  the transplant surgeon, the transplant coordinator and the \ndoctor who harvests the organs  will confirm the blood type of the \ndonor and recipient match.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Santilln had been suffering almost since birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, to poor laborers. At age 12 she \nwas found to have restrictive cardiomyopathy, a condition \ncharacterized by an enlarged and weakened heart and malfunctioning \nlungs. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the chance of a transplant in Mexico virtually impossible, they \npaid a smuggler to take them to the United States, through the desert \nand eventually to Durham, where relatives had said there were \nhospitals to help them.\u0014\nFebruary 23, 2003   New York Times\u0014",

    "words": "March 4, 2003, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                               \nGod, Satan and the Media\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\n\u0014\nClaims that the news media form a vast liberal conspiracy strike me \nas utterly unconvincing, but there's one area where accusations of \ninstitutional bias have merit: nearly all of us in the news business \nare completely out of touch with a group that includes 46 percent of \nAmericans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the proportion who described themselves in a Gallup poll in \nDecember as evangelical or born-again Christians. Evangelicals have \nmoved from the fringe to the mainstream, and that is particularly \nevident in this administration. It's impossible to understand \nPresident Bush without acknowledging the centrality of his faith. \nIndeed, there may be an element of messianic vision in the plan to \ninvade Iraq and \"remake\" the Middle East.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Fogel of the University of Chicago argues that America is now \nexperiencing a fourth Great Awakening, like the religious revivals \nthat have periodically swept America in the last 300 years. Yet \noffhand, I can't think of a single evangelical working for a major \nnews organization.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals are increasingly important in every aspect of American \nculture. Among the best-selling books in America are Tim LaHaye's \nChristian \"left behind\" series about the apocalypse; about 50 million \ncopies have been sold. One of America's most prominent television \npersonalities is Benny Hinn, watched in 190 countries, but few of us \nhave heard of him because he is an evangelist. \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Bush has said that he doesn't believe in evolution (he \nthinks the jury is still out). President Ronald Reagan felt the same \nway, and such views are typically American. A new Gallup poll shows \nthat 48 percent of Americans believe in creationism, and only 28 \npercent in evolution (most of the rest aren't sure or lean toward \ncreationism). According to recent Gallup Tuesday briefings, Americans \nare more than twice as likely to believe in the devil (68 percent) as \nin evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn its approach to evangelicals, the national news media are \ngenerally reflective of the educated elite, particularly in the \nNortheast. It's expected at New York dinner parties to link crime to \ndeprived childhoods  conversation would stop abruptly if someone \nmentioned Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\nI tend to disagree with evangelicals on almost everything, and I see \nno problem with aggressively pointing out the dismal consequences of \nthis increasing religious influence. For example, evangelicals' \ndiscomfort with condoms and sex education has led the administration \nto policies that are likely to lead to more people dying of AIDS at \nhome and abroad, not to mention more pregnancies and abortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut liberal critiques sometimes seem not just filled with outrage at \nevangelical-backed policies, which is fair, but also to have a \nsneering tone about conservative Christianity itself. Such mockery of \nreligious faith is inexcusable. And liberals sometimes show more \nintellectual curiosity about the religion of Afghanistan than that of \nAlabama, and more interest in reading the Upanishads than in reading \nthe Book of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI care about this issue partly because I grew up near Yamhill, Ore., \nwhich has 790 people and five churches. My science teacher at Yamhill \nGrade School taught that evolution was false, and a high school \ngirlfriend attended a church where people spoke in tongues (contrary \nto stereotypes, she was an ace student, smarter than many people \nfluent in more conventional tongues, like French and Spanish). In the \nevangelical tinge to its faith, Yamhill is emblematic of a huge chunk \nof Middle America that we in the Northeast are out of tune with.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, it is increasingly not just Middle America, but Middle \nWorld. As Professor Philip Jenkins notes in a new book, \nfundamentalist Christianity is racing through the developing world. \nThe number of African Christians has soared over the last century, to \n360 million from 10 million, and the boom is not among tweedy \nPresbyterians but among charismatic Pentecostalists. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the deepest divides in America today is the gulf of mutual \nsuspicion that separates evangelicals from secular society, and \npolicy battles over abortion and judicial appointments will aggravate \nthese tensions further in coming months. Both sides need to reach \nout, drop the contempt and display some of the inclusive wisdom of \nEinstein, who wrote in his memoir: \"Science without religion is lame, \nreligion without science is blind.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company | Privacy\u0014",

    "title": "GOOD TO GREAT'S LEADERSHIP MODEL LOOKS FAMILIAR",
    "words": "Good to Great's Leadership Model \nLooks Familiar to Christians\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author of the bestselling business book says his findings on \nsuccessful leaders led him to the New Testament.\u0014\nAn Interview with Jim Collins | posted 03/14/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Collins, a former professor at Stanford Business School and \nfounder of his own management research laboratory, had already become \nwell-known in management circles for his first book, Built to Last \n(HarperCollins, 1994).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut with his recent book Good to Great (HarperCollins, 2001), he \nbecame an even more established name in the Christian business \nworldquite an accomplishment given that Collins has no affiliation \nwith Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of his findings resonated with the Christian audience, however, \nparticularly the concept of Level 5 Leadership. Collins and his \nresearch team discovered that leaders who took their companies from \ngood to great were not larger-than-life figures that typify today's \ncelebrity CEO culture, but instead were characterized by a unique \nblend of humility and resolve. As Collins explains in his book, \n\"Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and \ninto the larger goal of building a great company.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCollins spoke about his findings with former CT assistant editor \nHelen Lee.\u0014\n\u0014\nGood to Great has struck a nerve with Christian leaders, who have \nlatched on to your concept of Level 5 Leadership. Were you surprised \nby what your results showed about leadership?\u0014\n\u0014\nI am delighted that so many people in the Christian community \nresonate with the Level 5 concept. They probably feel tension between \nthe brutal competitiveness of the outside world and their inner faith \nand being a type of person that the New Testament calls you to be. If \nyou thought you had to be an anti-level 5 to be successful, but now \nyou find this evidence that your instincts were right all along, that \ncan be powerful.\u0014\n\u0014\nI should point out that we were not looking for Level 5. This is very \nimportant. I really dislike leadership answers, I'm biased against \nthem, and I didn't want to write about leadership. I certainly wasn't \nlooking for leaders like this. Our findings were a complete shock, \nand to see that these were the distinguishing type of leaders was out \nof left field and remarkable.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe kind of leaders who took companies from good to great match up \nwith the findings of the great leaders of the world religions. That \ngives it so much power. It would be one thing if I came from that \npoint of view to begin with. But I didn't believe this would be true, \nand yet the evidence led us to it. In the big picture, it makes \nsense. You would hope that in some rational way that the universe \nworks, the findings would map with the teachings of great world \nreligions. But I see that now in retrospect. Therefore, as a result, \nI'm that much more influenced by the findings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do Good to Great companies treat their employees?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe came across a number of paradoxical findings. Clearly the notion \nof people came first, but not in the way you normally think about it. \nWe learned that people are not the most critical asset. The right \npeople are. So much so that great companies will put picking the \nright people ahead of picking the right strategy. Secondly, these \nGood to Great leaders were in service to their company, not to their \npeople. This is a different idea from servant leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo these great companies were bipolarthey were great places to work \nfor the right people. But they were terrible places for the wrong \npeople. Great company leaders didn't see it as their objective to \nmake it a great place to work. There was an absence of motivational \nprograms. That's because they had the right people: those who wanted \nto be part of an environment that succeeds and wins, and whose values \nconnected with the values of the institution.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's one of the most demeaning, barbaric things to think of human \nbeings as a lump of inert coal that can be fired on with a ray gun \ncalled motivation. Great companies find people who are intrinsically \nself-motivated. If they're only motivated because someone motivated \nthem, they're the wrong people. The key in management is not to \nde-motivate people who are motivated.\u0014\n\u0014\nMotivation is not the same as affirmation, however. I have wonderful \npeople here who don't need motivation. But I like to affirm them when \nI can. Still, have you ever had a great professor who didn't affirm \nbut for whom you worked your butt off? People want to be in an \nenvironment with the highest standard; it inspires them. Being \nsomeplace where you can feel proud of your organization is inspiring.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, what really makes a place the right place to work? First, the \nvalues. Second, the people who connect with those values, and then \nthirdthat the model and system and all the work produce real results.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat trends did you notice in Good to Great companies' treatment of \nemployees?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst of all, there's no evidence that a company has to have concern \nfor its employees as a core value. There are a number of inherently \ngreat companies that didn't have this. I don't think Walt Disney \ncared about his people. He cared about films, and Disneyland, and \nsmiles of kids. On the other side, with Hewlett-Packard and IBM, you \nhad the antithesis of Walt Disney. When you look at corporate \nhistory, what matters is not what core values you have but that you \nhave core values. And that you believe them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two sides to that coin. If you don't have concern for \nemployees as a core value, don't say that you do. That will cause \nmore harm. Fundamentally, if your value system is the mission, then \nbe honest about it and pursue it fanatically. The other side of the \ncoin is equally important: there's no evidence that you're at a \ncompetitive disadvantage if you do have a tremendous concern for your \npeople. You can have a great company having that as a core value. So \nthe real question is, what are your company values? Live them \nfanatically.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the typical barriers to becoming a Level 5 leader?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question regarding Level 5 is, which side is harder for you? The \nhumility or the will? The magic of Level 5 is the combination of the \ntwo, not just one or the other. One side is usually harder for people \nthan the other. Sometimes it takes brutally hard decisions to be \nLevel 5. What if Abraham Lincoln could not stomach the consequences \nof his being Level 5, which was to endure five years of the bloodiest \nconflict so that our nation could live? Would you do whatever is \nneeded for the cause?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf your struggle is on humility side, have people track your \nquestions-to-statements ratio. You should see that ratio go up over \ntime. Another thing is to really practice the discipline of the \nwindow and the mirror. Give credit to people outside the window and \nlook at the mirror when things go wrong. As for the will: when you \ncome to a fork in the road, one side is about being comfortable, and \nthe other is about the cause, or the mission, or the work. You know \nthat the best thing for the cause is to go one way, but the more \ncomfortable decision for you is to step right. The key is to try to \nkeep increasing your tendency to step left.\u0014\n\u0014\nHas writing this book had any impact on you?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book changed me more than Built to Last. On every dimension, it \nchanged me. I find Level 5 challenging for me. The standard is \nenormously compelling. And for me the \"who\" question is now the most \nsignificant. I think about it whenever I make decisions, whether it's \nwho to hire or who to have renovate my kitchen. It's all about \"who.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI have absolutely no religious background at all, which gives me more \nconfidence in the findings. If I had come from a strong religious \nbackground, I'd be more suspicious. After the book came out, I kept \nhearing people say to me, \"There was this ultimate Level 5 leader who \nlived 2,000 years ago. The things he talked about in the Gospel have \ngreat compatibility with what you say.\" Of course I had heard about \nJesus, but as a result of finding out about Level 5, I was inspired \nto begin reading the New Testament to see for myself.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information.\u0014",

The tree snapped upright and \nthe kitten instantly sailed through the air and out of sight.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe felt just terrible and walked all over the neighborhood asking \npeople if they had seen a little kitten. Nobody had and finally he \nprayed, \"Lord, I commit this kitten to Your keeping,\" and then went \nabout his business.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later he was at the grocery store and met one of his \nchurch members. In her shopping cart he was amazed to see cat food. \nNow this woman was a cat hater and everyone knew it, so he asked her \nwhy she was buying cat food when she hated cats so much.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe replied, \"You won't believe this but I have been refusing to buy \nmy little girl a cat even though she has been begging for one. \nFinally I told her that if God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I watched my child go out into the yard, get on her knees and ask \nGod for a cat. And really, Pastor, you won't believe this but I saw \nit with my own eyes. A kitten suddenly came flying out of the blue \nsky with its paws spread out and landed right in front of her.

Aaron \nremained in critical condition early Monday at a Dallas Hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a call to emergency workers early Saturday, Laney reported that \nshe had just ``bashed their heads in with a rock,'' Sheriff J.B. \nSmith said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they arrived at the home, sheriff's deputies found Joshua and \nLuke dead in the yard wearing only their underwear, large rocks on \ntop of their bodies. Aaron was found in his crib with a pillow over \nhis face, alive but bleeding.\u0014\n\u0014\nWearing bloodstained pajamas, Laney told the first deputy on the \nscene ``I had to'' when he took her into custody, according to an \narrest affidavit obtained by the Tyler Morning Telegraph.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith said Laney acted erratically Sunday during interviews with \ninvestigators.\u0014\n\u0014\n``Sometimes she is incoherent, sometimes she's in a fetal position \nand sobbing. Sometimes she's singing spiritual hymns or muttering \nabout God and sometimes she has a flatliner (poker) face and not \nsaying a thing during interviews,'' Smith said. ``But she has not \nspoken of the crime anymore. She said it all on the 911 tape. She \nsaid she had killed her children.''\u0014\n\u0014\nLaney, he said, claimed that God ordered her to kill her sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boys' deaths were announced Sunday to more than 200 members of \nthe First Assembly of God Church, where Laney sang in the choir and \nher brother-in-law, Gary Bell, is the pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBell told his parishioners that he and his wife, Judy, would stand \nbehind Laney.\u0014\n\u0014\n``This was a brutal and horrific incident that has changed our lives \n(and will) for years to come,'' Bell said. ``But we all believe as a \nfamily that this wasn't our Dee that did this to her children.''\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother Texas woman, Andrea Yates of Houston, confessed to drowning \nher five children in a bathtub in June 2001 and was convicted of \nmurder.

    "words": "God's Calling Plan\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does God summon leaders for his cause?\u0014\nby Marshall Shelley, Leadership editor\u0014\n\u0014\nFugitive and sheep-herder Moses had an irresistible encounter with a \nburning bush. Peter and Andrew left fishing nets to follow an \nitinerant rabbi and were recognized and promoted from the larger \ngroup of followers and designated by their leader as \"apostles\" (Luke \n6:13-14). For Saul, it was a blinding light, the Lord's clear voice, \nand the grace-filled guidance of Ananias.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd throughout the centuries ever since, Christian leaders have been \ncalled by unlikely means.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Chrysostom, preferring the quiet of the cloister, refused an \ninvitation to become bishop of Constantinople. Only after he was \nkidnapped and forcibly installed did he accept the position as God's \ncalling for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was returning to law school during a violent storm, and \nlightning struck so close that he feared for his life. \"Save me, \nSaint Anne, and I'll become a monk,\" he cried. Amazingly, he honored \nthe panic-provoked vow, which turned out to be the beginning of a \nreligious calling that forever changed the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Graham, the summer after his high school graduation and just a \nyear after responding himself to an evangelist's invitation to accept \nChrist, was selling Fuller brushes when he tagged along with Jimmie \nJohnson, a 23-year-old evangelist who was going to preach in the \nlocal jail. At least in part as a practical joke, Johnson introduced \nBilly to the inmates as a new convert who wanted to tell what God had \ndone for him. Billy, who hadn't preached before, was taken off-guard \nbut gave it a try, based on what he'd heard other evangelists say. \nHis opening line was an awkward and inappropriate: \"I'm glad to see \nso many of you here this afternoon.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe went on, as biographer William Martin describes it, to somewhat \noverstate the darkness of his pre-conversion condition: \"I was a \nsinner and a no-good. I didn't care anything about God, the Bible, or \npeople.\" He went on to say that \"Jesus changed my life! He gave me \npeace and joy! He can give you peace and joy! He will forgive your \nsins and he forgave mine if you will only let him into your heart.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe offered no invitation, and no inmates professed \"decisions,\" but \ndoing the work of an evangelist had begun for Billy Graham. Was this \nthe direction God was calling him to go? For two more years, Billy \nprotested that he lacked the eloquence to be an evangelist. At the \nsame time, Billy confessed later, \"In the most unusual way, I used to \nhave strange glimpses of the crowds that I now preach to.\" The search \nfor a clear understanding of the call spoiled Billy's sleep until \nfinally, around midnight one evening, he returned from a long, \nbrooding walk and knelt to say, \"All right, Lord, if you want me, \nyou've got me. I'll be what you want me to be and I'll go where you \nwant me to go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to biographer Martin, \"That was it. It may not have been \nloud, but he had his call. Now, he had to preach.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHas God called you? And if so, to what? Among believers, these \nquestions are never far from the surface. They're crucial questions, \nespecially if you're in church leadership. They touch the very \nlegitimacy of your position. Is what you're doing truly your \n\"vocation\" (from the Latin vocare, meaning a response to hearing a \nvoice)? Is your work a \"calling\" or just a job?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is complicated by the fact that all Christians, in some \nsense, are called. The most prominent use of the word call in the New \nTestament is the Christian's call to salvation. \"And you also are \namong those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ\" (Rom. 1:6). And \nall disciples of Jesus are called to fulfill his Great Commission in \nMatthew 28, \"Go and make disciples of all nations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, we are all called to exercise our spiritual gifts. Peter \nwrites, \"Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve \nothers, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms\" (1 \nPet. 4:10).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the question for faithful readers of this newsletter is not \"Am I \ncalled?\" The question is \"What has God called me to do with these \npeople?\" And it helps to trace the movements of how God arranges that \nrelationship and impresses the calling upon his chosen ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe'd like to hear your \"calling\" story for an upcoming issue of \nLeadership. How do you know that God has chosen you for ministry? How \ndid God communicate to you that your vocation would be in ministry? \nYou can reply by clicking the link below.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMarshall Shelley is editor of Leadership.\u0014",

    "words": "Going Native\u0014\n\u0014\nSettling for \"my way\" tempts pomos, boomers, in fact, every age \ngroup. And it's deadly.\u0014\nby Alex McManus\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago, in a Los Angeles nightclub, we began a worship \ncelebration designed to reach the west side of our city and the \nentertainment industry. That ministry grew, incorporating changes \nalong the way to continue reaching new people. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut soon some of the original attenders began to complain that things \nwere getting too \"youthy.\"\u0014\n\"I can't handle it anymore,\" said one young woman. \"All of this new \ntechnology is getting in the way of my worship.\" She was 26.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone once asked me, \"Why do so many Baby Boomers, who were such \nadvocates of change in the church 20 years ago, resist the changes \nneeded to reach postmoderns?\" But as the young lady from the \ncelebration club demonstrated, even postmoderns exhibit resistance to \nchange. Often they'll change the church to fit people \"just like me,\" \nbut no further.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we turn a church from being self-absorbed to being relevant \nto others?\u0014\n\u0014\nNatives or conquistadors?\u0014\nBoth modern and postmodern churches are inhabited by \"natives.\" \nNatives are people comfortable within their own culture. Ministries \ntargeted at their tastes will attract them, and as long as those \nministries continue in that culture, they'll stay. The gospel \naccording to a native says, \"Welcome into our community. But don't \ntouch the stereo.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches also contain \"conquistadors,\" people who have a sense of \nmission to take the gospel to the world. But they insist on taking \ntheir culture with it. The gospel according to a conquistador is, \n\"Repent and remove the jungle gym from your face. Come take a pew. \nWhen you look just enough like us, we'll think of you as one of our \nown.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years ago I piloted a celebration not in our usual sanctuary, but \nin a multi-purpose facility. We mobilized artists and musicians, \nusing visual components to construct a different worship experience \ntargeting urban gypsies.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward one of our resident conquistadors said, \"Why do we have to \nhave this kind of ministry here? They should come join us\"meaning in \nthe sanctuary, subjugated to the tastes of the conquistadors.\u0014\nI regularly converse with both conquistadors and natives (at Mosaic, \nthese are mostly young people, postmoderns). They consistently \nstruggle with Mosaic's commitment to keep reaching the next \ngeneration. \"Can't it ever be about us?\" they ask.\u0014\n\u0014\nResistance to change isn't a function of age or generation. Every \ngeneration has within it both natives and conquistadors, those who \nplace a high value on doing church \"the way we like.\"\u0014\nBut there is a third group of people, often harder to find, that have \ngrasped a greater vision for the church. The are not consumers of \nchurch who shop for a place to meet their needs. Rather, they look \nfor a place to serve Christ and reach others. If we can encourage our \nchurches to catch their vision, we can all become missionaries to \ngeneration next.\u0014\n\u0014\nKevin came to Mosaic as a summer intern. He was assigned to a \npredominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Kevin spoke no Spanish, \ncouldn't dance a salsa rhythm, and was conspicuously white. But Kevin \nhad social intelligence, enthusiasm, love, and perhaps most \nimportantly, the vision of an \"immigrant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe immigrant option\u0014\nImmigrants are characterized by a willingness to make a personal \nculture shift. While conquistadores and natives know how to do things \ntheir way, immigrants adapt to their environment.\u0014\nKevin's immigration began as he launched a small group in a local \nresidence by offering English classes. His group grew even though \nthey often didn't understand what he said. In fact, they seemed to \nshow up to help him teach them English. At summer's end his \nappreciative students threw him a large partyroasted pig and allat \nwhich he presented the gospel and witnessed a group conversion.\u0014\nIf a church is to be relevant to future generations, one after the \nnext, it must find and foster people like Kevin, people who are \nwilling like Christ, to reach out to others right where they are. The \nchurch must go native to reach a culture, but it must also raise \nimmigrants.\u0014\n\u0014\nFighting the gag reflex\u0014\nImmigrants to foreign cultures know what the gag reflex is. They've \nbeen offered a local delicacy and tried it for politeness' sake. \nTheir stomach tightened. Their throat refused the offering. Gag.\u0014\nIn Acts 10, when God instructs Peter to eat alien, unclean foods, I \nsuspect Peter gagged. The problem in many churches of all generations \nis that there is not enough gagging going on.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago my mother invited a friend from Latin America into our home \nin the U.S. The first night we prepared an American dinner of steak, \nbaked potatoes, green beans, and corn. As our guest, we served him \nfirst. We passed him the sour cream for his baked potato, and he \nreceived it graciously, scooped a generous helping, and placed it \nsquarely on his steak. Then he passed the sour cream along.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy siblings and I were young, but everyone intuitively knew the right \nthing to do at that moment. We all put sour cream on our steaks as \nwell. Helping our friend feel comfortable was simply more important \nthan suiting our tastes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin each generation are those willing to become an immigrant for \nthe sake of others. If you look closely, you can find them. They are \nthe ones joyfully rising before sunrise to make sure the sound is set \nand the chairs are in place for worship. They're hosting prebelievers \nat dinners in their homes. Their eyes are not merely focused on \ncelebrating within a society of their peers, but are lifted toward \ntouching all nations. It has nothing to do with age, generation, or \nculture, but with being seized by Jesus, the immigrant from heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can encourage people to become immigrants. We can challenge our \npeople to ask, \"What have I done recently outside my comfort zone \nthat reaches others for Christ?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue is not, \"Are you modern or postmodern?\" This issue is, \"Are \nyou a conquistador, a native, or an immigrant?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlex McManus is a leader at Mosaic, a church in Los Angeles.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 by the author or Christianity Today\u0014",

A descendant of the Trottlander \ntribe of southern Norway myself, I grew up on\u0014\n                     a farm in midwest Minnesota and experienced the \nidentical landscapes so vividly\u0014\n                     described in Rolvaag's masterpiece.

It is \ninteresting to note the order of effects the pastoral\u0014\n                     loneliness produces in its inhabitants. Beret, \nlike many other non-natives living on the\u0014\n                     Great Plains, views the land as a lethal threat \ntoo pervasively gargantuan to overcome.\u0014\n                     Per on the other hand, views the land like so \nmany of my father's generation: a fertile\u0014\n                     blessing that contains some of the most arable \nland on the entire planet. The attitudes of\u0014\n                     the novel's central characters towards their \nsituation comes to reveal their strengths and\u0014\n                     weaknesses in a poignant, bittersweet saga as \nmorose and sublime as the land itself.\u0014\n                     Compelling, tragic, humorous and underspoken, \nRolvaag's Giants in the Earth reflects\u0014\n                     the feelings and goals of an entire generation \nof immigrants striven to succeed at all\u0014\n                     costs. Thankfully for us all, they did. \u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\n                              \u0014\n                     Reviewer: Scott Johnson (see more about me) from \nTitusville, Florida \u0014\n\u0014\n                     O.E. Rolvaag's epic GIANTS IN THE EARTH is truly \nan American classic, especially for\u0014\n                     those of Norwegian or Scandinavian descent or \nthose who've lived in the Great Plains. It\u0014\n                     seems to be a true description of the life the \nearly settlers lived, the desperation of\u0014\n                     opressive freedom, and the claustrophobic effect \nof too much open space. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Per Hansa, the protagonist of our story, moves \nhis family from a fishing village in Norway\u0014\n                     to the plains of the Dakota Territory in the \nlast part of the 19th century. They are\u0014\n                     homesteaders, the people who settled the untamed \nprairie and bound themselves to it,\u0014\n                     sometimes at great personal cost.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Rolvaag brilliantly describes both the \npsychological effect of early prairie life and the\u0014\n                     Norwegian immigrant culture of the time. Being a \nnew land, there were new challenges,\u0014\n                     new ideas, and new opportunities. In Per Hansa, \nRolvaag invents a character that\u0014\n                     displays the passion and drive of the early \nsettlers. His wife, Beret, like so many wives of\u0014\n                     the time, follows him with little idea of the \nhardships and, unfortunately, none of the\u0014\n                     psychological tools to deal with them. Their \nneighbors are wonderfully crafted: Tonesten,\u0014\n                     the whiner; Kjersti, his strong, capable, \ndisrespectful wife; Hans Ola, the solid,\u0014\n                     dependable Scandinavian whose success is not so \nmuch from following his dreams as it\u0014\n                     is making no mistakes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     One comes to love the settlers even as they deal \nwith squatters, locusts, sod houses,\u0014\n                     and the endless winter of the northern Plains. \nMidwestern Americans of Scandinavian\u0014\n                     descent will know that this is our story - our \ngreat-grandparents and great-great\u0014\n                     grandparents were contemporaries of Per Hansa \nand Beret. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Rolvaag should know this story - he himself was \nan immigrant and lived in Northfield,\u0014\n                     Minnesota for many years. The book was \noriginally written in Norwegian and published in\u0014\n                     Norway, so in translation some idioms and \ncultural forms are hard to understand, but the\u0014\n                     translators and editors of the current text do a \nfine job with footnotes and introductory\u0014\n                     material.\u0014",

    "title": "GIANTS IN THE EARTH -- NEPHILIM",
    "words": "There were Giants on the earth... The Nephilim.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n     The increasingly popular interpretation of the following passage \nis that it relates a story of angels\u0014\n     interbreeding with the human race, and that this was a primary \nreason for God destroying most of\u0014\n     humanity with the great flood. Let's look at this passage in an \nattempt to shed some light-\u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on \nthe face of the earth, and\u0014\n          daughters were born unto them,\u0014\n          Gen 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that \nthey were fair; and they\u0014\n          took them wives of all which they chose.\u0014\n          Gen 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always \nstrive with man, for that he also is\u0014\n          flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\u0014\n          Gen 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and \nalso after that, when the sons\u0014\n          of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare \nchildren to them, the same\u0014\n          became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\u0014\n          Gen 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in \nthe earth, and that every\u0014\n          imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil \ncontinually.\u0014\n          Gen 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on \nthe earth, and it grieved him\u0014\n          at his heart.\u0014\n          Gen 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have \ncreated from the face of the\u0014\n          earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the \nfowls of the air; for it\u0014\n          repenteth me that I have made them.\u0014\n          Gen 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. \u0014\n\u0014\n     So now let's evaluate each verse, and what it is saying- \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on \nthe face of the earth, and\u0014\n          daughters were born unto them,\u0014\n\u0014\n     This verse is straightforward. The human population on earth \nbegan to increase in numbers. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that \nthey were fair; and they\u0014\n          took them wives of all which they chose.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Now this verse is full of meaning. Some will point to Job 1:6, \n2:1 and 38:7 where the same phrase\u0014\n     \"sons of God\" is translated sometimes as angels, and conclude \nthat this also refers to angels as well.\u0014\n     The Hebrew words used are - ben: H1121 and 'elohiym: H430: \u0014\n\u0014\n          1121. ben, bane; from H1129; a son (as a builder of the \nfamily name), in the widest sense\u0014\n          (of lit. and fig. relationship, including grandson, \nsubject, nation, quality or condition, etc.,\u0014\n          [like H1, H251, etc.]) ...\u0014\n\u0014\n     So the phrase \"Sons of God\" is a generic term that can mean the \nsubjects or nation of God. It is not a\u0014\n     phrase limited to just the angelic host, it has a wider meaning. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The sons of God in Gen 6:2 speaks of those men who were (or \nclaimed to be) obedient to the will of\u0014\n     God, they were the people of God. In opposition to this are the \ndaughters of men (not obedient to\u0014\n     God). These woman were quite attractive and alluring, and had \nlittle trouble enticing the sons of God\u0014\n     into intimate relations and marriage. In doing so, the sons of \nGod quickly abandoned God for these\u0014\n     women and their ways. \u0014\n\u0014\n     This is basically a retelling of the fall of Adam and Eve. Eve \nlistened to the lies of Satan and doubted\u0014\n     God. She ate from the forbidden tree and fell from the spiritual \nnature she previously enjoyed. That\u0014\n     tree was the tree of knowledge of good and evil (Gen 2:9, 17). \nUpon eating from the tree, Eve was\u0014\n     aware of what she had done. She now had the knowledge of evil \nand she was aware that she had\u0014\n     sinned against God. In that knowledge, and having fallen, she \nthen offered the fruit from the tree to\u0014\n     Adam. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Adam was not deceived (1 Tim 2:14). He knew when he saw Eve that \nshe had sinned, because she\u0014\n     had lost the spiritual glow that results from being in close \nspiritual harmony with God. Moses had this\u0014\n     same glow when he came down from Sinai (Exo 34:29, 30). Adam \nelected to eat the fruit, knowing what\u0014\n     he was doing. His love for Eve (whom he knew had sinned) was \ngreater than his love of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n     This is a tactic used time and again by Satan. The downfall of \nGod's people is frequently through the\u0014\n     temptations of godless women (See Numbers 25:1-9). Other \nexamples that come to mind are Samson\u0014\n     and Delilah, and David and Bathsheba. \u0014\n\u0014\n     So, now back to Gen 6:2. The same basic scenario is being \nrepeated after the garden of Eden, only\u0014\n     on a larger scale. There is a wholesale abandonment of God and \nhis righteous ways for women known\u0014\n     to be in sin. This is what God calls fornication, not referring \nonly to a sexual sin, but the sin of mixing\u0014\n     the righteous with the wicked, truth with evil. (One example of \nthis is the word fornication as attributed\u0014\n     to the harlot church in Rev 17:4 and 18:3) This sin was so \nprevalent, and so blatant a rejection of God\u0014\n     that it could not be allowed to continue indefinitely. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always \nstrive with man, for that he also is\u0014\n          flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\u0014\n\u0014\n     God in this verse has just set a period of probation of 120 \nyears on the human race to repent of their\u0014\n     wicked ways. It could not be allowed to continue. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and \nalso after that, when the sons\u0014\n          of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare \nchildren to them, the same\u0014\n          became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The word \"giants\" here in the Hebrew is listed in Strong's as \nfollows- \u0014\n\u0014\n          5303. nephiyl, nef-eel'; or nephil, nef-eel'; from H5307; \nprop., a feller, i.e. a bully or\u0014\n          tyrant:--giant.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Rather than being just physical giants, this may mean that in \ncontrast to the meek people of god, these\u0014\n     people were rebellious bullies and tyrants, forceful in \ncharacter and great in their sins. This same\u0014\n     phrase of \"giants\" is also used to describe the Canaanites \nfollowing the exodus (Num 13:33). Again,\u0014\n     this probably referred to their godless character, as well as \ntheir physical stature.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in \nthe earth, and that every\u0014\n          imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil \ncontinually.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The fault here is laid squarely on the wickedness of the people \nthemselves. As a result of choosing\u0014\n     godless women, men were turned away from God as well, and sin \nflourished. God was rejected, and\u0014\n     forgotten. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on \nthe earth, and it grieved him\u0014\n          at his heart.\u0014\n          Gen 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have \ncreated from the face of the\u0014\n          earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the \nfowls of the air; for it\u0014\n          repenteth me that I have made them.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Sin became so great, that God had to bring the flood on them, to \ncleanse the earth of such great\u0014\n     wickedness. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Gen 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Noah was the exception, and he was given the task to build the \nark, that would be the refuge from the\u0014\n     flood for those obedient to God.\u0014\n\u0014\n     So, now back to the popular story about this passage. Based on a \nvery narrow interpretation of the\u0014\n     phrase \"sons of God\" as found here in Genesis, and bolstered by \nJob 1:6; 2:1; 38:7; and Psalms 29:1;\u0014\n     82:6, the case is made that this is referring to heavenly \nbeings/angels that interbred with women,\u0014\n     causing a ghastly mixed breed of creatures that God had to \ndestroy. \u0014\n\u0014\n          John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he \npower to become the sons of\u0014\n          God, even to them that believe on his name:\u0014\n\u0014\n          Rom 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they \nare the sons of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The above verses make clear that phrase \"sons of God\" applies to \nanyone with faith. So the angelic\u0014\n     interbreeding story appears to be nothing more than an attempt \nto put the blame on angels rather\u0014\n     than man. The passage in Genesis 6 speaks only to the wickedness \nof humanity, and places no blame\u0014\n     at all on angels or other heavenly beings. Humanity had turned \ntheir back on God, and did it on such a\u0014\n     scale that God was moved to destroy them. Yet, God in His mercy, \namid all the wickedness, still did not\u0014\n     act hastily to exact his judgment. He gave humanity a period of \nprobation. A time of 120 years, during\u0014\n     which Noah could preach the message of God, of repentance and \nfaith. Through that period of\u0014\n     probation, people heard the word of God, that they might be \nsaved. Eventually Noah and 7 members\u0014\n     of his family were saved in the ark.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Luke 17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be \nalso in the days of the Son of\u0014\n          man.\u0014\n          Luke 17:27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, \nthey were given in marriage,\u0014\n          until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood \ncame, and destroyed them all.\u0014\n\u0014\n     It should be clear, to even a casual reader, that we have \nentered into that day of the Son of Man.\u0014\n     History is repeating itself. There are \"giants\" on the Earth \nagain. The Nephilim again are filling the\u0014\n     earth with sin. Man's cup of iniquity is again reaching the \nbrim, and God will not let it continue much\u0014\n     longer. We have no angels to place blame on, and neither did \nthose people in the time of Noah.\u0014\n     Mankind is willfully abandoning God for the sake of the sins of \niniquity. Yes, Satan and the other fallen\u0014\n     angels can tempt mankind, just as Eve was tempted, but the \nchoice to sin was Eve's and Adam's, and\u0014\n     is also ours to make. The door of probation is soon to close \nagain on this wicked world, just as it did for\u0014\n     the people of Noah's generation, but this will be for the final \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee: Word\\My Documents-Giants in the Earth\u0014",

    "title": "GOING IT ALONE",
    "words": "Going It \nAlone\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should take heed when much of the world says it distrusts us.\u0014\nBy Philip Yancey | posted 07/02/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the war on Iraq I heard a caller on a Christian radio station \nsuggest, \"Why don't we just raze the United Nations buildings in New \nYork and rebuild the World Trade Center on that site!\" The host \nenthusiastically agreed. For the next hour, callers piled on scorn \nfor France, Germany, and other nations that had \"wimpy\" objections to \nthe war, while dismissing all Arab concerns out of hand. The United \nStates, they seemed to imply, has the right, even the obligation, to \ngo it alone in bringing order to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause I frequently travel overseas, I am struck by the difference \nin how Americans perceive themselves and how those of other nations \nsee us. We think of ourselves as generous, compassionate, \ngood-natured, slow to anger, and committed to justice. Some overseas \nsee us as arrogant, selfish, decadent, and uncaring. They judge \nAmerican values by our rap music and television shows, most of which \nglorify sex, wealth, and violence. They know that the U.S. military \npossesses more weapons of mass destruction than all other armies \ncombined. And they note that the world's wealthiest nation \ncontributes only half as much foreign aid as Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe outpouring of sympathy after September 11 demonstrated that the \nU.S., for all its faults, could still draw on a large reservoir of \ngoodwill. WE ARE ALL AMERICANS NOW, proclaimed one headline. The fact \nthat the newspaper was the largest in France shows how much of that \ngoodwill has since dissipated.\u0014\n\u0014\nI heard the former Ambassador to the U.S. from Pakistan, a devoted \nfriend of America, put it this way: \"In the days of the Cold War, \nthere were two giants on the world stagea brutal giant and a gentle \ngiant. Now there is only one giant, and we fear it is becoming \nbrutal.\" Even our closest allies see the U.S. as a loner nation that \npulls out of treaties that don't serve our interests. We backed out \nof the Kyoto Accords, the Law of the Sea, and the International \nCriminal Court, as well as treaties controlling land mines and \nchemical weapons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe callers on the talk show recounted some of those reversals with \npride. \"Who needs the rest of the world?\" asked one. But as the war \nin Iraq made clear, we need the rest of the world. When television \nbroadcast the Iraqis' abuse of our POWs, we appealed to the Geneva \nConvention. When rumors spread about illicit weapons, we threatened \nan international war crimes tribunal. As bills for reconstruction \nmounted, we turned to other nations for help.\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope and pray that the war in Iraq, with its enormous toll in both \nhuman suffering and economic costs, leads to stability in the region \nand reduced terrorism globally. I fear just the opposite, that sowing \nthe wind may reap the whirlwind. As Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak \nwarned, the war could inflame Arabs and produce 100 bin Ladens.\u0014\n\u0014\nA friend of mine traveling in Malaysia brought back a newspaper \nreport of a speech by the prime minister there. Right now, we cannot \nstop the U.S. from doing whatever it wants, admitted Malaysia's \nleader. Our only hope is to produce our own weapons, our own \"Islamic \nbomb.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMy concerns come in part from discussions with the one group of \nconservative Christians most nervous about anti-Americanism: \nmissionaries. They bear the brunt of world opinion, and sometimes pay \nfor it with their lives. One wrote, \"Arabs are interpreting war \nagainst Iraq as Christian aggression against an Islamic nation. This \nfalse perception is so deeply ingrained among most Arabs that it \nundermines any perception of Christianity as a message of love and \npeace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the world's only superpower, the United States bears grave \nresponsibilities of leadership. Sometimes we must use force, and \nsometimes restraint. Sometimes we must act against world opinion. \nPopular psychiatrist M. Scott Peck makes an intriguing observation:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is notable that two hundred years ago this new nation spent \nvirtually no money and no energy attempting to control the behavior \nof the other nations of the world. Yet one by one, almost ten by ten, \nthe peoples of these nations followed our spiritual and political \nexample to seek the same freedoms for themselves. It is hard to \nescape the conclusion that in the years since, our political and \nspiritual leadership has declined in inverse proportion to the \nincreasing amounts of money and effort we have expended to manipulate \nother countries. . . . I wonder, if we in the United States were to \nconcentrateas our overwhelmingly major priorityon making ourselves \nthe best possible society we can be, whether the nations of the world \nmight once again, without any pressure except the influence of \nexample, begin to emulate us.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information.\u0014\nJune 2003, Vol. 47, No. 7, Page 72\u0014",

An in-depth look at a D.A.'s struggle to ensure that \nonly the guilty go to the death chamber\u0014\n\u0014\nBy JOHN CLOUD\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 20, a man named Keith Clay died in Texas. His death was \nlargely unremarkable except for one thing: he was the 300th person \nexecuted in Texas since the U.S. Supreme Court reauthorized capital \npunishment in 1976. One need not ignore the savagery of his crimes  \nprosecutors said Clay stood by while a friend murdered a father and \nhis two kids on Christmas Eve 1993, 11 days before Clay himself \nbutchered a store clerk  to pause at his execution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred is an impressive milestone, not only because it exceeds \nthe number of executions in the next five top death-penalty states \ncombined, but also because it was reached so quickly. It took nearly \ntwo decades for Texas to consummate its first 100 death sentences \nafter 1976--but only five more years to pass 200 and just three after \nthat to hit 300. (The total has since climbed to 306.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe approach of the 300th execution happened to coincide with a \nperiod of intense scrutiny of capital punishment. In January the \ndeparting Republican Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, delivered the \nbiggest blow when he commuted the sentences of all 167 people who \nwere to be executed in his state. \"Our capital system is haunted by \nthe demon of error,\" Ryan declared, \"error in determining guilt and \nerror in determining who among the guilty deserves to die.\" He and \nothers argue that problems like racially motivated prosecutions, \ncoerced confessions and unreliable witnesses have made the system \ncapricious. Such worries may help explain why many states with \ncapital punishment  there are 38 in all  seem to be wavering. The \nnumber of executions in the U.S., excluding Texas, fell to 38 last \nyear from a peak of 63 in 1999.\u0014\nSee Word\\MyDocuments\\Death's Door for full article\u0014",

    "title": "GRATEFUL FOR JUSTICE O'CONNOR",
    "words": "A Baptist Is Grateful for Justice O'Connor\u0014\nby Melissa Rogers\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has now convened for its 2003-2004 term. The \nCourt may act on the Pledge of Allegiance case, and it has already \nagreed to hear what could be a very significant case regarding state \nconstitutional limits on government funding for religious activities. \nThe Baptist Joint Committee has filed an amicus brief in the \nfinancial aid case, and I commend it to your reading (www.bjcpa.org).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to anticipating specific religious liberty issues and \ncases that could arise during this term, I also am taking a moment to \nbe grateful that Justice Sandra Day OConnor remains on the nations \nhighest bench. Toward the end of the last Court term, there was much \nspeculation -- empty as it turned out -- that OConnor would retire. \nWhile I part ways with Justice OConnor on some church-state issues, \nI deeply appreciate the fact that, on many occasions, she has \nforcefully defended principles that are consistent with a traditional \nBaptist vision of religious freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Justice OConnor recently blew the whistle on an \ninterpretation of the First Amendment embraced by fellow Justices \nThomas, Rehnquist, Scalia and Kennedy, saying the interpretation \nwould allow the government to provide direct money payments to \nreligious organizations (including churches) and allow the \nparticipating religious organizations (including churches) [to] use \nthat aid to support religious indoctrination. While OConnor \nacknowledged that the opinion of these four justices did not \nexpressly approve such practices, she noted that it clearly \nforeshadow[ed] the approval of direct monetary subsidies to \nreligious organizations, even when they use the money to advance \ntheir religious objectives. \u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists traditionally have been strong supporters of bars on the use \nof direct public subsidies for religious activities, arguing that the \nstate simply has no business subsidizing religion. Moreover, Baptists \nhave argued for centuries that these subsidies sap religions \nvitality and distract it from its mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustice OConnor also has taken serious issue with the Courts new \nstandard for interpreting the Free Exercise Clause, an interpretation \nthat seriously underprotects the crucial right to practice ones \nfaith. The Courts action has been most keenly felt by minority \nfaiths that have little political power to seek accommodation of \ntheir sometimes-unfamiliar religious practices. Having once been a \nreligious minority, Baptists at their best have fought vigorously for \nthe protection of the free exercise rights of all religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn questions of religious speech, Justice OConnor has articulated a \ndistinction long championed by the Baptist Joint Committee: [T]here \nis a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, \nwhich the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing \nreligion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect. \nThus, she has upheld a law that allows students at secondary public \nschools to organize chess clubs and Bible clubs that meet during \nnon-instructional time. On the other side of the coin, she joined a \nruling majority that struck down a public schools practice of \norganizing votes that allowed students to use the school microphone \nto offer prayers before high school football games. The Court held \nthat the policy establishe[d] an improper majoritarian election on \nreligion, and unquestionably ha[d] the purpose and create[d] the \nperception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series of \nimportant school events.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the rare opportunity to speak with Justice OConnor on the day \nthe Court handed down its ruling in the football prayer case. When I \ncomplimented her on the Courts decision, she gave me a wry smile and \nsaid, As you know, the decision is not universally admired. She was \nright, of course. But I would argue that her embrace of these \nprinciples has shaped, and continues to shape, American religious \nfreedom in a significant and profoundly positive way. \u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nQuote of the Month by Tony Campolo\u0014\n\"No matter how you cut it, whenever a faith-based organization does \nsocial work, it is either directly or indirectly propagating its \nfaith, which is something the government should not financially \nsupport. . . . I think Christians, especially American Christians, \nshould be stepping up to the plate and using their own vast resources \nto fund the vital social work of our churches and faith-based \norganizations.

But does it?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Steven Gertz | posted 11/21/2003\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ sure is \ngetting a lot of heat these days. With\u0014\n                      more than two months left to go yet before its \ntheatrical release, prominent\u0014\n                      Jewish leaders, foremost among them New York \nState Assemblyman Dov Hikind,\u0014\n                      have labeled Gibson's film as anti-Jewish. \n\"This film can potentially lead to\u0014\n                      violence directed against the Jewish \ncommunity,\" Hikind asserted. \"It will result in\u0014\n                      anti-Semitism and bigotry. It really takes us \nback to the Dark Ages \u2026 the\u0014\n                      Inquisition, the Crusades, all for the \nso-called sin of the Crucifixion of Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's true that Christians have directed hatred \nagainst Jews throughout church history. But if\u0014\n                      Gibson is correct in saying his movie is \nfaithful to the Gospels, Hikind is protesting the heart of the\u0014\n                      Christian story itself. Conservative Catholic \nJohn McCloskey notes, \"If you find the Scriptures\u0014\n                      anti-Semitic, you'll find this film \nanti-Semitic.\" And so some have, like Irwin Borowsky, who has\u0014\n                      cut out entire sections of the New Testament \nthat Jews find offensive and has published his\u0014\n                      version as the American Holy Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But are the Gospels anti-Semitic? Most \nChristians today would contend anti-Semitism and\u0014\n                      Christianity clearly can't be \ncompatible\u2014Jesus' command to love one's neighbor overrides any kind\u0014\n                      of rationale permitting violence against Jews. \nBut then how do we explain passages in the New\u0014\n                      Testament that seem to come down hard on the \nJews?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two recent books help us unpack this \nquestion\u2014and come up with quite different solutions.\u0014\n                      Constantine's Sword, published in 2001, \ngarnered widespread acclaim among the media, though\u0014\n                      some Christian critics refused to join in the \npraise. James Carroll, a former Catholic priest who\u0014\n                      wrote his book on a fellowship with Harvard \nUniversity, traced the history of Christian\u0014\n                      anti-Semitism, beginning with the early church \nall the way into modern times. His theory\u0014\n                      concerning the roots of anti-Semitism is \ninteresting: Jesus, a faithful Jew, was anything but\u0014\n                      anti-Semitic. He faithfully observed Jewish law \nand customs, celebrated Jewish holidays, and\u0014\n                      made pilgrimages to the Temple. And he hated \nthe brutal Roman occupation of Judea and Galilee\u0014\n                      as much as any other Jew.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But when we read the New Testament, argues \nCarroll, we are reading the text of writers a\u0014\n                      generation or more removed from its events. By \nthen, the church was losing its Jewish identity\u0014\n                      (owing to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus \nin A.D. 70 and the phenomenal growth of the\u0014\n                      Gentile church through the missionary journeys \nof Paul and others). \"The tragic difference that\u0014\n                      would set in motion the razor-edged arc of this \nnarrative,\" writes Carroll, \"was that they who now\u0014\n                      heard this story, and who retold it, were not \nJews.\" In other words, a Gentile church had no\u0014\n                      sympathy for Jews who rejected Jesus as the \nmessiah, and so it resorted to anti-Jewish\u0014\n                      sentiment, while Jewish Christians (had the \nchurch remained Jewish) would have instead mourned\u0014\n                      their people's choice and stayed in \nrelationship with them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rather than carving anti-Semitic passages out \nof Scripture, Carroll's solution is to recover the\u0014\n                      \"Jewish\" character of Jesus and Paul in his \nreading of Scripture. But he does so in a disturbing\u0014\n                      way\u2014the writers of the New Testament wrote \nwith a Gentile, anti-Semitic bias, Carroll claims, so\u0014\n                      we must read between the lines to perceive the \n\"real\" Jesus. In doing so, he questions the\u0014\n                      Resurrection and divinity of Christ, suggesting \ninstead that his disappointed disciples formed a\u0014\n                      \"healing circle\" to comfort themselves in their \ngrief. \"His love survived his death,\" writes Carroll,\u0014\n                      \"which is what the Resurrection means.\"\u0014\nAnd that's where orthodox Christians part ways with Carroll. A writer \nequally conscious of the\u0014\n                      Jewish character of the early church but \nfaithful to the message of the Gospels is Oskar\u0014\n                      Skarsaune. In his newly published In the Shadow \nof the Temple, Skarsaune busts the myth that\u0014\n                      Carroll buys\u2014that Christianity lost its \nJewish roots by the end of the first century and\u0014\n                      consequently turned anti-Semitic. No, says \nSkarsaune, Christians returned to Jerusalem after\u0014\n                      Titus left the ruins smoldering. And \nfourth-century historian Eusebius records a list of Jewish\u0014\n                      Christian bishops beginning with James, brother \nof Jesus, running unbroken until 135 A.D., when\u0014\n                      Jewish revolutionary Bar Kokhba challenged \nRoman rule and Hadrian responded by leveling\u0014\n                      Jerusalem and prohibiting Jews (including \nJewish Christians) from living there.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What about the charges of anti-Semitism in the \nNew Testament? If we look at the letters of Paul\u0014\n                      (some of the earliest written) we find him \nfollowing Jesus' own policy by taking the gospel \"to the\u0014\n                      Jew first\" during his missionary journeys. \nGentiles who listened to Paul and converted to\u0014\n                      Christianity were almost always \"God-fearers\" \nalready attached to a local synagogue. Such people\u0014\n                      esteemed Jewish law highly, points out \nSkarsaune, and they understood their newfound faith in\u0014\n                      Christ to be in continuity with the promises \nmade to God's chosen people, the Jews. Rather than\u0014\n                      despising the Jews, these new believers held \nthem in highest regard for having introduced them\u0014\n                      to the one true God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What do we do, though, with \"difficult\" \npassages like Stephen's speech to the Sanhedrin in Acts\u0014\n                      7, in which he blasts the Jews as \"stiff-necked \npeople with uncircumcised hearts and ears?\"\u0014\n                      Understand it, rather, as a rebuke from within, \nmuch as the prophets of the Old Testament called\u0014\n                      their people to repentance. This is the pattern \nwe find throughout Scripture\u2014the Jews falling\u0014\n                      away from the true worship of Yahweh and God \ncalling a prophet to turn them back. These same\u0014\n                      people now refused to accept the incarnate Word \nof God, Stephen would say, much as they had\u0014\n                      jeered and shamed the prophets of old. His \nintent was not to smear the Jewish name, but to\u0014\n                      reconcile his Jewish brethren to the risen Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is a message Hikind and other Jews \nprotesting The Passion of Christ don't want to hear. But\u0014\n                      if they would give Gibson's film a chance, they \nmight perceive the good news in Jesus' story\u2014that\u0014\n                      their messiah has come, and that those who \nbelieve in him will reign with him in his second\u0014\n                      coming. And this coming will inaugurate that \nkingdom Jews have been awaiting for so long.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright \u00a9 2003 by the author or Christianity \nToday\u0014",

Not surprisingly, Groote had \neven begun translating the Bible. He died before he got far on the \ntask. He death, like his life, was devoted to the body of Christ. \nDespite personal risk, he visited one of his beloved followers who \nhad been infected by the plague and was cut down himself aged 44.

Until then \nhe had lived a life of luxury, for his parents were well-to-do. \nImmediately he dedicated his life to Christ. Now he gave up almost \neverything he owned. He would be poor like Christ. Indeed, his entire \nmission would be Christ-centered and aim at taking men deeper in the \nknowledge of Jesus. After two years as a guest in a Carthusian \nmonastery, Groote became a deacon and obtained permission to preach. \nHe worked his way through the lowlands -- Flanders, Guelders and \nHolland--as a traveling preacher, teaching the word of God and \ndecrying the abuses prevalent in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo severe were Groote's attacks on current errors that his \nauthorization to preach was yanked.

    "words": "December 24, 1968 \u0014\nAstronauts Read Genesis from the Moon\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 24, 1968, the spacecraft Apollo VIII, carrying \nJames A. Lovell, William Anders and Frank Borman became the first \nmanned vehicle to circle the moon. The three orbited the earth's \nsatellite 10 times before firing their engines to head home. At their \nclosest approach, they \"skimmed\" just sixty-nine miles above the \ndesolate, gray surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring their ninth orbit, the astronauts sent photographs back to \nearth, describing their awe at the bleakness of the moon and the \nbeauty of the earth. (Borman's photograph of a half earth hanging \nabove the moon's horizon is the most famous shot ever taken from \nspace; the postal service printed it on a stamp.) All three \nastronauts commented on the colorlessness of the moon.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his autobiography Countdown, Frank Borman later wrote, \"There was \none more impression we wanted to transmit: our feeling of closeness \nto the Creator of all things. This was Christmas Eve, December 24, \n1968, and I handed Jim and Bill their lines from the Holy Scriptures.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout six weeks before launch, a NASA official had called Borman. \nNoting that the crew would be circling the earth on Christmas Eve, he \nsaid, \"We figure more people will be listening to your voice than \nthat of any man in history. So we want you to say something \nappropriate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout time to research the question himself, Borman appealed to his \nfriend Si Bourgin, a NASA employee. Bourgin posed the question to Joe \nLaitin, formerly a United Press International reporter. Laitin's \nsuggestion pleased Borman. He had the words typed on fireproof paper. \nFor the men, homesick for earth, the chosen words could hardly be \nmore appropriate. \u0014\n\u0014\nBill Anders read Genesis 1:1-4. \"In the beginning God created the \nheaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and \ndarkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved \nupon the face of the waters. And God said, 'Let there be light:' and \nthere was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God \ndivided the light from the darkness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Lovell took the next four verses. \"And God called the light Day, \nand the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning \nwere the first day. And God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the \nmidst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' \nAnd God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under \nthe firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it \nwas so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the \nmorning were the second day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrank Borman finished with, \"And God said, 'Let the waters under the \nheaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land \nappear': and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the \ngathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it \nwas good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the men completed the orbit, Lovell said, \"I don't know who your \ntwo friends were, but they sure hit the target.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven months later, Americans landed on the moon.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBorman, Frank with Serling, Robert J.

    "title": "GOD CANNOT BE FOUND IN NOISE AND RESTLESSNESS",
    "words": "Many of us were moved a few years back when the story \ncame out about how the D.C. snipers were apprehended. Do you remember \nin October 2002 when those tragic shootings were being perpetrated in \nWashington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia? Ten people were killed and \nthree others were critically injured. Many citizens assisted police \nin solving this heinous crime. Among these was trucker Ron Lantz, a \nresident of Ludlow, KY.  \u0014\n\u0014\n            Lanz was listening to a radio show when he heard a \ndescription of a car being sought by officials in connection with the \nsniper case. A short time later he noticed a car that matched the \ndescription, a Chevrolet Caprice, at a Maryland rest stop and called \n9-1-1. He was one of several who called police that night, and not \nthe first.\u0014\n\u0014\n           However, he did play an important part in capturing the \ntwo suspects. After calling 9-1-1, Lantz and another driver blocked \nthe exits to the rest area, effectively trapping the suspects until \npolice could arrive. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHere is what is special about Lantz' story, as verified by several \ntrusted sources. About a week before he helped make this capture, \nLantz was driving down the Interstate when he heard another report \nabout the snipers. He decided somebody needed to pray about this \nsituation. He got on his C-B radio and sent out a call to any other \ntruckers who were nearby to join him at a certain rest area for a \ntime of prayer about this situation. It was getting dark when Lanz \npulled his rig into the rest area. There were about 50 other rigs \nalready there. They all got out of their cabs and stood in a circle, \nholding hands, 60 or 70 of them, including some wives and children. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Let's pray, Ron Lantz said. And for almost one hour they \ndid just that. They prayed that these killings would come to an end. \nAnd one week later Ron Lantz spotted a Chevrolet Caprice at a \nMaryland rest stop. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAre the two related? Some will say, Coincidence. Yada, yada, yada. \nBlah, blah, blah. All they will hear is thunder. And perhaps they are \nright. Perhaps it was coincidence. But I know this, if you are not \ndaily communicating with God, making known your requests and \nlistening for God's reply, you are missing out on the greatest \nresources life has to offer, the leading of God in an uncertain world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMother Teresa of Calcutta put it this way: We need to find God and \nhe cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of \nsilence. See how nature--trees, flowers, grass--thrive in silence; \nsee the stars, the moon and sun, how they move in silence . . . The \nmore we receive in silent prayer, the more we can give in our active \nlife. We need silence to be able to touch souls. The essential thing \nis not what we say, but what God says to us and through us.\"\u0014",

    "words": "August 20, 1384 \u0014\nGerard Groot's Death by Association\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he died on this day, August 20, 1384, Gerard Groote left behind \nhim a band of followers dedicated to reforming the church, spreading \nthe gospel in all Christendom and putting the scriptures into the \nhands and minds of the common people. Not surprisingly, Groote had \neven begun translating the Bible. He died before he got far on the \ntask. He death, like his life, was devoted to the body of Christ. \nDespite personal risk, he visited one of his beloved followers who \nhad been infected by the plague and was cut down himself aged 44. He \nhad labored only ten years for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nGroote was born in 1340. Not until 1374 was he converted. Until then \nhe had lived a life of luxury, for his parents were well-to-do. \nImmediately he dedicated his life to Christ. Now he gave up almost \neverything he owned. He would be poor like Christ. Indeed, his entire \nmission would be Christ-centered and aim at taking men deeper in the \nknowledge of Jesus. After two years as a guest in a Carthusian \nmonastery, Groote became a deacon and obtained permission to preach. \nHe worked his way through the lowlands -- Flanders, Guelders and \nHolland--as a traveling preacher, teaching the word of God and \ndecrying the abuses prevalent in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo severe were Groote's attacks on current errors that his \nauthorization to preach was yanked. He was in some danger of further \npenalties, but the plague carried him off before any action could \ntranspire. Eventually opposition to the lay Brethren caused them to \nbecome Augustinian monks.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the start, Groote, gathered men around him to copy scriptures \nand religious texts. From the revenues they earned doing this, they \nsupported themselves and helped the poor. They did not beg for alms. \nThe band became known as the Brethren of Common Life. Eighteen houses \nof these brethren had formed before Groote died. Groote also gathered \na group of women called the Sisters of Common Life. These groups did \nnot take monastic vows. Nor were they bound to remain celibate. Any \ncould leave the group at any time. Their aim was to live the life of \nChrist while engaged in toil. This way of life became known as \nDevotio Moderna (the modern way of serving God). These brethren \nbecame deeply interested in education and used their residences as \nschools in larger cities. They produced some famous pupils.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those trained by the Brothers of the Common Life were many men \nwhose names live on. Nicholas Cusa wrote works of considerable \ninfluence among the scientists and churchmen of his day and rose to a \ncardinalate. Thomas  Kempis wrote or collated the devotional classic \nThe Imitation of Christ as well as the lives of Groote and some other \nearly leaders of the New Devotion. He, too, was Christ-centered. \"If \na man knows what it is to love Jesus, and to disregard himself for \nthe sake of Jesus, then he is really blessed.\" Decades later, another \npupil, Erasmus, became the greatest scholar of his age and an agent \nof reform.

    "words": "A Baptist deacon heard marvelous stories of the greatly beloved \npastor and preacher George W. Truett. George Truett was one of the \nmost influential preachers and church leaders of the past 2 \ncenturies. Truett was a former president of the Southern Baptist \nConvention, and pastored the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas. \nPresident Woodrow Wilson appointed Truett to preach to American \ntroops in WWI, and even today, Baylor University's Theological \nSeminary is named after this great preacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis deacon spoke with such respect for Truett on so man y occasions \nthat his family purchased Powhatan James' biography of him. James was \nhis son-in-law and wrote with affection and accuracy of his life and \nhis ministry. The family felt that they had found something really \nimportant to this deacon and went to great pains to buy each of eight \nbooks of Truett's sermons as they were released from the publisher.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tVolume 1: Some Vital Questions \u0014\n\tVolume 2: Sermons from Paul \u0014\n\tVolume 3: The Prophet's Mantle \u0014\n\tVolume 4: The Salt of the Earth \u0014\n\tVolume 5: The Inspiration of Ideals \u0014\n\tVolume 6: Who is Jesus? \u0014\n\tVolume 7: On Eagle's Wings \u0014\n\tVolume 8: After His Likeness\u0014\n\u0014\nHe took great pride in owning these volumes, being rather confident \nthat not many of his acquaintances had such fine materiall. He would \nshow these books to visitors in his home and speak glowingly of them, \nstressing the inspiration they brought to him. He even seemed \nprotective of them, not wanting to lend them out for fear that they \nmight not be returned or not be returned in their present mint \ncondition.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his death, as some of his possessions were being distributed \namong the family, a son familiar with such works, picked up the \nvolumes and one at a time could see that the \"newness\" of the books \nwas very obvious. They each had the tightness of a volume that is \ncommon to new books. It was clear that they had never been opened \nmuch less read.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis widow was asked if she had ever seen him reading any of these. \nShe replied, \"Not to my knowledge. He was very proud of them, but I \ndon't think he ever read one. At least I never saw him if he did.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what do we see in this picture? We see a man whose personal \ntestimony about the great sermons of Truett were total \"fluff,\" \nartificial to the ultimate degree. He never heard one nor had he ever \nread one although the entire library was at his disposal.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillions of Bibles are sold every year. It continues to be a best \nseller, but many of those copies are left on a coffee table, being \nmore of an ornament than reading material, more a curiosity than \nserious spiritual instruction. Many are left on shelves with the full \nintention of getting arlound to them one day, but often that day \nnever comes or rarely does.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is a book, but it remains only a book if we don't pick it \nup and make some attempt to read it for our spiritual growth. \nWouldn't it be sad to have it said of us, \"She was very proud of it, \nbut I don't think she ever read it. At least I never saw it if she \ndid.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPs 119:11 \"Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin \nagainst You.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Craig Groeschel Seeks Revenge after His Sister's Sexual Abuse\u0014\n\u0014\nMy biggest struggle with bitterness started when my family discovered \nthe awful truth about someone we had trusted in a position of \nauthority over my little sister . Most kids in our small town junior \nhigh school took at least one class from [a man named] Max on their \njourney through the sixth grade. To many kids, Max was a favorite \nteacheralways cutting up, telling jokes, and handing out easy As. To \nme, he became the object of the deepest bitterness that I've ever \nknown.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the years, Max developed special relationships with his \nfavorite students. Though none of us were aware of it at the time, we \ndiscovered years later that all his favorite students \"happened\" to \nbe cute, young girls. My little sister, whom I treasured and loved, \nbecame one of Max's victims .\u0014\n\u0014\nSome studies show that as many as one out of three girls and one in \nfour boys suffer some sort of sexual abuse. Whatever the numbers, \nthis tragedy must crush God's heart. I know it crushed mine as a \nbrother.\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember trying to absorb the painful truth. How should I respond? \nShould we track him down? Have him arrested? Beat the life out of \nhim? Make no mistake; I was furious the moment that I heard about his \nabuse. But the more I thought about it, my anger blossomed into rage. \nThe seeds of bitterness planted in my heart grew to a full-blown \nbriar patch of revenge. I prayed that Max would suffer eternally in \nhell, and I vowed to make him suffer on earth before facing God's \njudgment.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy plan for revenge wasn't necessary. To my bittersweet delight, we \nfound that Max was suffering in a hospital, fighting for his life \nagainst a crippling disease, muscular dystrophy. I remember thanking \nGod for his justice in giving Max what he deserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost would agree that my bitterness toward Max was justifiable . \n[But] no matter how justifiable my feelings were, in God's eyes my \nself-righteous hatred was just as sinful as Max's crime. Even writing \nthat statement all these years later remains difficulthow could my \ndesire for justice be considered as sinful as this monster's lustful \nactions? The vast majority of people would agree that my hate and \njudgmental rage were more than justified.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the course of time, however, I learned that bitterness never draws \nus closer to God. Bitterness is a nonproductive, toxic emotion, \nusually resulting from resentment over unmet needs . I wanted [Max] \nto suffer . [but] I was punishing no one but myself and those around \nme who experienced the scalding spillovers of the acid churning \ninside me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCraig Groeschel, Soul Detox (Zondervan, 2012), pp. 92-94\u0014",

The Ghetto was the place where Jews \nwere allowed to practice their religion unhindered. It may be derived \nfrom the Venetian word getto meaning a 'foundry'. There was an iron \nfoundry in the vicinity. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt may come from Egitto 'Egypt,' from the Latin Aegyptus drawing on \nmemories of Joseph and Moses, slavery and salvation. Or it may come \nfrom the Italian word borghetto meaning a 'small section of a town' \nlike our English word borough. Whatever the origins, the word \n'ghetto' now has deeply unpleasant overtones. The fate of the Warsaw \nGhetto in which the Jews were walled-in and where the great majority \ndied of starvation, disease or the bombing in 1943 leaves a ghastly \nand lingering memory.

    "words": "Getting \nPushy on the Online Playground\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat church leaders need to know about a concerning new trend among \nyouth.\u0014\nby Lee A. Dean\u0014\n\u0014\nBullying and cyberbullying are not legal terms, but umbrella \nphrases that cover a variety of behaviors. As such, there are a range \nof uses for the terms. Church leaders must know and understand them, \nparticularly in the context of youth ministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Paula Burns, an agent for Insurance One Agency who \nstudies bullying and other social media risks, these differing \ndefinitions of terms agree on key points. With these in mind, it can \nbe said that bullying can include some or all of these elements:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAttack or intimidation with the intention to cause fear, distress \nor harm. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPhysical attacks, such as hitting, punching, or taking property. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tVerbal attacks, such as name calling or teasing. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPsychological/relational attacks, such spreading rumors and social \nexclusion. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe presence of a real or perceived imbalance of power between the \nbully and the victim. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRepeated incidents between the attacker and the victim.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Burns, cyberbullying is an aggressive, intentional act \ncarried out by a group or individual using electronic forms of \ncontact repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily \ndefend him or herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt can take the form of sending mean, vulgar, or threatening messages \nand images, posting sensitive or false information about a person, \npretending to be someone else in order to make that person look bad, \nor intentionally excluding someone from an online group.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut church leaders should realize that being the victim of such \nbehaviors carries its own inherent stigma. No one wants to admit to \nbeing bullied. According to CJ Malott, student pastor at Fielder \nChurch in Arlington, Texas, middle-schoolers and high-schoolers dont \nparticularly like to use the term bullying. He observes that A lot \nof students ask for counseling about being bullied, but they say \ntheyre being picked on, or made fun of. They dont use the word \nbullying anymore, but thats what it is.\u0014\nLegally, a church is at risk if it fails to monitor and supervise \nyouth under its direct care. Churches may be at legal risk if they \nknow bullying goes on and yet do not take appropriate action to \nrecognize and respond to such situations.\u0014",

    "words": "The Prayer Hand Illustration\u0014\nGetting a Grip on Prayer\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres probably no better barometer\u0014\nfor indicating the depth of our relationship\u0014\nwith God than our prayer\u0014\nlife. And yet, many Christians struggle\u0014\nmore with this spiritual discipline\u0014\nthan any other. Perhaps part of that\u0014\nis due to the fact that our prayer\u0014\nlives become one-dimensional. Too\u0014\noften asking God for stuff is as far\u0014\nas our prayers go. No relationship\u0014\ncan flourish and grow if its onedimensional.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Prayer Hand is a tool\u0014\nNavigators have been using for\u0014\nyears to help believers maintain a more\u0014\nrounded prayer lifeone that incorporates\u0014\nfive distinct elements of prayer and results in a\u0014\ndeeper relationship with the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nConfession: This type of prayer keeps us honest and\u0014\nhumble before God. We acknowledge our sin and agree\u0014\nwith God that what weve done is wrong. If we confess our\u0014\nsins , he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and\u0014\npurify us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). This restores\u0014\nour relationship with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nPetition: This aspect of prayer focuses on asking God to\u0014\nmeet our specific needs. Its a heartfelt acknowledgment of\u0014\nour dependence on God to meet our needs. An example of\u0014\nthis is when Hannahwho couldnt have childrenasked\u0014\nGod to give her a child. I prayed for this child, and the Lord\u0014\nhas granted me what I asked of him (1 Samuel 1:27).\u0014\n\u0014\nIntercession: This kind of prayer is others-focused and\u0014\nemphasizes asking God to meet the needs of others or to\u0014\nintervene in events that affect those around us. The apostle\u0014\nPaul demonstrated what this kind of prayer was about\u0014\nwhen he told the Ephesian Christians: And pray in the Spirit\u0014\non all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With\u0014\nthis in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the\u0014\nsaints (Ephesians 6:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nThanksgiving: Telling someone thank you is critical in\u0014\nany relationship. This kind of prayer gratefully acknowledges\u0014\nwhat God has done for you. Paul urged the Ephesians\u0014\nto practice this kind of prayer, telling them they should be:\u0014\nalways giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the\u0014\nname of our Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:20).\u0014\n\u0014\nPraise: This aspect of prayer allows us to voice our\u0014\nwonder and awe about who God really is. It is completely\u0014\nGod-focused. Its our chance to delight in God. The\u0014\npsalmist captured the essence of this beautifully: Praise\u0014\nthe Lord. O my soul. I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing\u0014\npraise to my God as long as I live (Psalm 146:1,2).\u0014\n\u0014\nRegularly using all fingers of the Prayer Hand can\u0014\nhelp you develop a more balanced prayer life and a deeper\u0014\nrelationship with God. And the great thing is that you can\u0014\ntake this tool with you wherever you go!\u0014\n\u0014\nCONFESSION\u0014\n\u0014\n1 John 1:9\u0014\n\u0014\nPETITION\u0014\n\u0014\n1 Samuel 1:27\u0014\n\u0014\nINTERCESSION\u0014\n\u0014\nEphesians 6:18-19\u0014\n\u0014\nTHANKSGIVING\u0014\n\u0014\nEphesians 5:20\u0014\n\u0014\nPRAISE\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 146:1-2\u0014\n\u0014\nAgreeing with God about my sin\u0014\n Asking God for my needs\u0014\nPraying for others\u0014\nThanking God for what He has done for me\u0014\nVoicing my wonder about who God is\u0014",

    "words": "Globalising giving \u0014\n\u0014\nFeb 19th 2013, . | NEW YORK The Economist Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\n\tTHE mission led by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to make \nlarge-scale philanthropy the norm among the super rich has just won a \ndozen new converts. For the first time, those taking the \nBuffett-Gates \"Giving Pledge\" come from outside America, according to \nthe announcement on February 19th. The total number of billionaires \npledging to give away at least half their wealth by the end of their \nlives now stands at 102.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe new signatories are an interesting mix of rich and \nemerging-economy money. The best known is Richard Branson, who used \nto be a notable sceptic about traditional personal philanthropy. \nBritish hedge fund boss Christopher Cooper-Hohn has also signed up, \nwhich will surprise no-one who has followed the activities of the \nChildren's Investment Fund Foundation run by his wife, Jamie. \nLikewise, mobile phone entrepreneur, John Caudwell. As for David \nSainsbury, a super market tycoon, he was starting to give away most \nof his pile long before Messrs Buffett and Gates even thought about \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore intriguing is Hasso Plattner, a founder of SAP, a software \ngiant. Does his signature indicate a thawing of the traditional \nreluctance of rich Germans to talk publicly about their wealth or, \nwhen they do it, their giving? Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest, an Australian \nmining billionaire, has also been challenging Australia's \nconservative rich to do bigger, bolder philanthropy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral of the signatories are from emerging economies. The former \ncommunist bloc is represented by Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian who \nholds an annual philanthropy discussion in Davos during the World \nEconomic Forum, and Vladimir Potanin, a nickel mining magnate. There \nare two Africans. Mo Ibrahim, a mobile phone billionaire, has long \nbeen giving to support efforts to improve governance in the \ncontinent, including through a large prize for retired African \nleaders who did a good job in office. Patrice Motsepe, a South \nAfrican mining boss, is the first black African billionaire to \npromise to give away so much.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one Malaysian, Tan Chee Yioun, whose property development, \ngaming and sports conglomerate includes Cardiff City Football Club, \nand one Indian, Azim Premji, a technology tycoon whose giving has \nlong been large and public. This seems like a small return on the \nconsiderable efforts of Messrs Buffett and Gates to encourage more \nphilanthropy by rich Indians. Likewise, their visits to China have \nyielded not one signatory, nor have their entreaties to Latin \nAmerica's super rich, such as Carlos Slim,who is by some measures now \nthe world's wealthiest man.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The 50% hurdle may be too high in some cultures,\" noted one American \nGiving Pledge signatory last week, adding that a more realistic goal \nmay be to get any sort of public commitment to give in some \ncountries, even if it is \"only\" for 10% or 20%. The idea that \nreducing your children's inheritance is good for them is perhaps \nuniquely popular amongst America's wealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, maybe these new signatories will inspire their peers, much as \nTed Turner's pledge in 1997 to give $1 billion to the UN did for his \nfellow American super rich. According to Forbes, there were 1223 \nbillionaires on the planet in 2012. 102 down, 1121 to go\u0014",

Assyria was the world superpower, rolling like a packing \nmachine over every country in sight. Recently (in 722 BC), Judah's \nnorthern sister neighbor Israel had succumbed to its fierce armies \nand was obliterated from the register of nations entirely. Under \nSennacherib, these same fighting forces wasted all of the cities of \nJudah except Jerusalem, and only a divine miracle sent the horde \npacking on the eve of a similar destruction spree.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah knew well from where Judah's \ndeliverance had come. Yahweh remained in charge, even as \ninternational politics played out their nasty scenes. Yet even as \nJerusalem reveled in the post-miracle beyond-belief deliverance from \nAssyria, darkness loomed on the horizon. While the military might of \nAssyria slunk tail-between-legs back to Nineveh, the eastern reaches \nof the empire plotted revolution. Babylon was rising in \nself-importance and intended not merely the overthrow of its master, \nbut also the conquest of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah warned Hezekiah about the Babylonian threat (Isaiah 39), \nparticularly because the king had begun a secret negotiation with \nenvoys as a political hedge against Assyrian resurgence. The \nBabylonians mounted their campaigns, and in the battle of Carchemish \n(612 BC) routed their overlords. Canaan, including Hezekiah's Judah, \nfell into Babylonian hands. Within three decades the new world power \nhad thrice besieged Jerusalem (607, 597, 586 BC) and the remnant of \nIsrael was exiled.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Yahweh, the God of the covenant, made promises through Isaiah \nthat God would always do the right thing for his people. In \nanticipation of the return that would come, today's lectionary \nreading announces divine commitments that the Jews could take to the \nbank. Soon and very soon the way back would be opened, and Judah \nwould be restored to live again in the prosperity of God's promises.\u0014",

Grahams senior by ten years, Shea devotedly preceded the \nevangelist in song in nearly every Crusade over the span of more than \none-half century.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamed gospel singer George Beverly Shea, who regularly opened for \nBilly Graham at his crusades for nearly six decades, died Tuesday \nevening \"following a brief illness.\" He was 104.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Shea's rendition of \"How Great Thou Art\" came to define the faith of \na Protestant generation that Graham helped bring to Jesus Christ,\" \nnoted the Associated Press in a lengthy obituary. \"He performed live \nbefore an estimated 200 million people at crusades over the years  \ntaking him from North Dakota to North Korea and beyond.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSaid Billy Graham:\u0014\n\u0014\nI first met Bev Shea while in Chicago when he was on Moody Radio. As \na young man starting my ministry, I asked Bev if he would join me. He \nsaid yes and for over 60 years we had the privilege of ministering \ntogether across the country and around the world. Bev was one of the \nmost humble, gracious men I have ever known and one of my closest \nfriends. I loved him as a brother. My prayer for his wife, Karlene, \nand his children, Ron and Elaine, is that God will strengthen them \nduring this time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis history of gospel music offers more details on how Graham and \nShea became partners. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The history of George Beverly Shea, in many senses, is the history \nof Christian music in the 20th century,\" noted Shea's authorized \nbiographer, Paul Davis, in an interview after Shea's 100th birthday. \n\"The number of people George has sung to is larger than anybody else \nin history. We know that because broadly speaking, it's the same \nnumber that Billy Graham has preached to.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe BGEA has released a lengthy video tribute to Shea.\u0014\n\u0014\nShea received many accolades over his career, including 10 Grammy \nnominations, a Grammy Award in 1965, and a Lifetime Achievement Award \nin 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe song most associated with Billy Graham is \"Just As I Am,\" but Bev \nShea's signature tune is clearly \"How Great Thou Art.\" Even though \nnearly every gospel artist - from Elvis Presley to the Mormon \nTabernacle Choir - has recorded it, it is Bev Shea's tune. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Winchester, Ontario, Canada, where his father was a Wesleyan \nMethodist minister, Sheas first public singing was in the choir of \nhis fathers church. Between Crusade, radio, and television dates in \nmany countries, he sang at hundreds of concerts and recorded more \nthan 70 albums of sacred music. At age 23 he composed the music to \none of his best known solos, Id Rather Have Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though Bev was 10 years older than my father, he never acted \nhis age, said Franklin Graham. He was absolute fun to be with. Bev \nwas one of the most gracious and unassuming men I have known. He was \nalways encouraging and supportive, a man of deep faith and strong \ncommitment to Jesus Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nShea is survived by his wife, Karlene, and his children from his \nfirst marriage, Ronald and Elaine. He was preceded in death by his \nfirst wife, Erma, who died in 1976.\u0014",

Last week, Live \nAction sent a woman who was 24 weeks pregnant into three abortion \nclinics -- one each in D.C., the Bronx and Phoenix -- posing as \nsomeone seeking a late-term abortion. \"[In our videos] these workers \nare describing how, in order to kill these babies, they either cut \nthe umbilical cord of the child and wait for it to asphyxiate, to \nsuffocate in the womb; how they rip that child out piece by piece \nusing forceps; or how they puncture the chest with a needle and \ninsert poison into the baby's heart to make it slowly die in over a \nhalf an hour,\" said Live Action president Lila Rose. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn each case the clinic workers -- and in one instance the \nabortionist himself -- were asked what they would do if the baby were \nborn alive, and they answered that it would be allowed to die. \"So \nwhat these abortionists are saying is they're willing to ultimately \nkill these children, drowning them in jars of toxic solution, or just \ndiscarding them and leaving them to die while they're struggling to \nsurvive in the abortion clinic,\" Rose said. \"This is infanticide, \nthis is murder, as well as abortion. ... The horrors of the Kermit \nGosnell trial are a widespread problem in this industry. Dismembering \nand destroying innocent children, leaving born babies to die, \ninjecting poison into the chest of a tiny child so that he slowly \ndies in his own mother's womb -- this is all standard operating \nprocedure in the abortion industry.\"\u0014",

    "words": "When Mahatma Gandhi traveled from his India homeland as a young man \nand studied for a time in England, he was curious about the religion \nof the British people. To learn more he bought a Bible and began to \nread it. He was amazed -- this was good stuff! Jesus' Sermon on the \nMount (Matthew 5-7) particularly intrigued him. This was a view of \nlife that really made sense! Surely the Christian faith was a \nreligion of great significance!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next Sunday Gandhi dressed early for a visit to a nearby church. \nHe wasn't sure what would take place in a Christian worship service, \nbut he knew that he wanted to be part of it. According to his \ntestimony, he had decided already that he wanted to become a \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately that worship service was one of the most awful events \nof his life. The singing was half-hearted; many people just stood \nwith mouths closed or merely mumbled along in boredom. The sermon was \na tedious explanation of some fine point of doctrine. It said so \nlittle and took so long to say it. Gandhi was glad to see that at \nleast some people benefited from the service -- they slept through \nmost of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi tried to be a fair person, so the next Sunday he went to a \nworship service at another church. He hoped, expectantly, for some of \nthe power and significance that breathed through the Bible. Yet this \ncongregation was little different from the last. The atmosphere among \nthe people was that of sophisticated indifference, and Gandhi left \nwith an empty heart. He tried a number of different churches for the \nnext three months but never met more than a kind of middle-class \nchurchianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi decided that the Christian church had nothing of value for \nhim, and he returned to his Hindu religious practices. To his dying \nday, however, he continued to read Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. He \nalso carried on a lifelong discussion with certain Christian leaders \nas to why their religion, built on such a magnificent foundation, \nseemed to make so little difference in people's lives.\u0014",

We were discussing the upcoming game against the \nGamecocks and lamenting the fact that we were going in with several \nkey players out with injuries, including our starting DE, Billy Payne \n(who ran the Atlanta Olympics and is now Ch of the Board at Augusta \nNational) and his roommate, MLB, Happy Dicks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 10:00 that night, another fraternity brother, Lewis Grizzard, \ncame in after he got off work. Our buddy was inactive at the time \nbecause he had gotten married over the summer to his high school \nsweetheart, Nancy ( the first of many--all with the same \nname--Plaintiff). In addition to taking a full load at the \nUniversity, he was working two jobs to help pay for (as he called it) \n\"this expensive habit.\" A talented young man, he was writing two \ncolumns daily - one in the morning for the Athens Banner Herald and \none in the afternoon for the Athens Daily News.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis walked in, went straight to the refrigerator, got a beer, \nplopped down in a chair, pushed his glasses back up his nose and \nannounced, \"Gentlemen, with any luck at all, tomorrow morning you'll \nwitness journalistic history. I have submitted my column and if it \ngets by my editor - and there's a good chance of that happening, \nsince he looked drunk earlier this evening - you'll enjoy the \ngreatest headline in the history of sports journalism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe refused to tell us what it was, and to be honest with you, we all \nforgot about it. As Lewis went home to his lovely, young bride, the \nfour of us went back over to the Fraternity house to get a head start \non the weekend.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning, as usual, I went straight for the Sports Section. \nAs I pulled it out, I could do nothing but smile, because our buddy \nhad pulled it off. To this day, Vince Dooley calls it his most \nmemorable column ever - all because of the headline, which read:\u0014\n\u0014\nDOGS TO PLAY COCKS WITH DICKS OUT.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's no doubt about it, it was \"the greatest headline in the \nhistory of sports journalism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was certainly one of a kind.

I doubt that any bargain would be \nsufficiently attractive to me now to lure me out of my \nair-conditioned car and into a steamy afternoon to pick peaches, but \nwe were younger then, poorer then and in less of a hurry than we tend \nto be these days. So we pulled over, paid our money, and selected a \nbushel basket to fill with fresh, ripe Spartanburg peaches.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As we set off into the orchard, an old fellow, as wrinkled as a \npeach pit and who was tending the place, said, 'If you want the best \nfruit, go deeper into the orchard; the peaches along the fringes are \npicked over, but deeper into the orchard, you'll find the best \nfruit.' We walked a way, far enough along that I figured we had gone \npast the picked-over sections. But just as we set the basket down, he \nhollered, 'Go deeper.' So we picked up the basket, went a little \nfarther, set the basket down, and again we heard him shouting his \nadvice, 'Go deeper. The best fruit's farther in.' Once more we picked \nup the basket and walked along, finally deciding that surely we were \nnow deep enough, but once more as we prepared to pick the peaches, he \nhollered, 'Go on. Go deeper.' This time we went a substantially \nlonger distance, and discovered that indeed he was right. The finest, \nplumpest peaches were untouched and waiting for us\" (101-102).\u0014",

Bars \nand churches would have to adopt policies and post signs to prevent \nconcealed weapons from being brought onto the premises. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe bill would also give primary and secondary schools (both public \nand private) the freedom to permit teachers and administrators to \ncarry concealed weapons on school property. In addition, rather than \narrest a licensed person caught carrying a gun on the campus of a \npostsecondary institution  including public and private colleges, \nuniversities and technical schools  the bill would mandate a mere \n$100 fine. The National Rifle Association has called HB 875 \"the most \ncomprehensive pro-gun reform legislation introduced in recent state \nhistory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Faith leaders from across Atlanta recently attended the bill's \nhearing before the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee of \nthe Georgia House of Representatives.

Sadly, other faith leaders in the state held a \ndifferent perspective. Mike Griffin, the new public policy spokesman \nfor the Georgia Baptist Convention, testified in support of HB 875 \nand claimed to speak on behalf of 1.3 million Georgia Baptists. \nGriffin, a former lobbyist for Georgia Right to Life, told House \nmembers that guns in the church is a pro-life cause. \"It's a sanctity \nof human life issue, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nI wonder how Griffin concluded that the best way to promote a \npro-life ethic is to be allowed to \"pack heat\" in the house of the \nPrince of Peace. Griffin's statement is surprising because \nconservative evangelical leaders have sought to limit the \"pro-life\" \nlabel to mean only opposition to abortion for many years. Thus, even \nthough I believe Griffin's assessment of HB 875 is misguided, he is \ncorrect to note that a commitment to the sanctity of human life \nextends beyond abortion. A commitment to the sanctity of human life \nrequires engagement with other issues, including gun control. \u0014\n\u0014\nAaron Weaveris communications manager for the Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship    2/24/14\u0014",

    "title": "GOD'S PROBLEM -- BART EHRMAN",
    "words": "B. Marold \"Bruce W. Marold\"\u0014\n\u0014\n`God's Problem' is prominent professional Biblical scholar, Bart \nEhrman's fourth (or more, depending on how you are counting) book for \nlay audiences on issues of Biblical scholarship and interpretation \nwhich usually never escape college and seminary classrooms, filled \nwith aging professors and relatively small classes. And, this one \nstands head and shoulders over the first three, `Lost \nChristianities', `Lost Scriptures', and `Misquoting Jesus' in its \nfinding and exploring a really important Biblical issue for \nChristians (and Jews, for that matter). While the information in the \nother three books may have been a bit of a surprise for many lay \nreaders, I can't say I was very disturbed about evidence that:\u0014\n\u0014\n`Lost Christianities' - There were several competing doctrines among \nearly Christians, and the one we know today was not always the clear \nfavorite.\u0014\n\u0014\n`Lost Gospels' - There are many Gospels and other first and second \ncentury Christian writings which suggested these positions, which did \nnot make it into the final Christian canon (the 26 books of the New \nTestament).\u0014\n\u0014\n`Misquoting Jesus' - There are numerous potential errors in the texts \nof the canonical books, created by both simple mistakes and attempts \nof copyists to `improve' the texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile all of these books are fascinating, extremely well researched, \nand told with deeply felt concern for the subject, my reaction to all \nis `This is all quite interesting, but no matter how relevant it may \nhave been to Professor Ehrman's intellectual history, it is really \nnot terribly earth-shaking. In any discourse, both ancient and \nmodern, differences of opinion exist and mistakes are made in quoting \nsources, no matter how divine those sources may be held.\u0014\n\u0014\n`God's Problem' is an entirely different kettle of fish indeed! It \ndeals with THE most important theological problem of any monotheistic \nreligion, the problem of pain. Now this is an issue over which can \nraise some serious questions of belief. As someone with a pretty \nrespectable training in Philosophy and a commitment to Christian \nbeliefs, I find Professor Ehrman's exposition and arguments totally \neven-handed, marvelously well informed, and completely lacking in any \ninterest to pry anyone from their own convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a devoted reader of subtitles and introductions, I find a great \nirony in this subtitle, `How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most \nImportant Question - Why We Suffer'. The irony is that the problem is \nnot that the Bible provides no answers; it is that the Bible provides \nat least four (4) different incompatible answers. The first is the \nanswer of the Torah and the early prophets. Israel suffered because \nit was being punished by God for infidelity. The second answer is \nthat of Job. We suffer to test our faith. The third is one answer of \nthe Christian doctrine of Jesus and Paul. Pain and suffering are \nredemptive. The fourth (and possibly the most convincing to those of \na logical bent) is that a malevolent force creates disasters large \nand small, from which God will save us in a future eschaton (Second \ncoming of Christ). \u0014\nA fifth, from the book of Ecclesiastes is the existentialist's \nsolution that there is no answer.\u0014\nLike the earlier book, `Misquoting Jesus', this story is embedded in \nProfessor Ehrman's own biographical encounters with problems of pain \nand how these have shaped his intellectual movement from firm \nbeliever in the literal truth of scripture to a doubting agnostic. I \nsense an unintended lesson here, after having read dozens of books by \nscholars as thoroughly imbued with the details of the canon as \nProfessor Ehrman, yet who have not lost their faith. Why have so many \nother equally learned scholars not taken the same route to suspend \ntheir belief? I will venture the suggestion that the answer lies in \nthe dangers of taking scriptures as infallible, when even the most \nrudimentary study reveals errors, disagreements and inconsistencies \nat almost every turn. The scenes of the creationists metaphorically \ncommanding the tides to hold back in the face of scientific evidence \nis a similar `side effect' of literalism. And yet, belief in \nChristianity is alive and well in intelligent people who know all \nabout these warts and blemishes in the human interpretations of the \nHoly Spirit we call the scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will make no presumptions to know the RIGHT answer to all of \nProfessor Ehrman's issues. There is no question that an answer has to \ntake his points seriously. And, the most serious issue is the basic \nproblem of reconciling suffering with an omnipotent God. Either God \nis not omnipotent or he simply is not held to the same morality as we \nmere humans. That is, either he cannot prevent earthquakes, tsunamis, \nvolcanoes, or genocides or he doesn't care about the suffering and \ndeath caused by these natural and human disasters. The second \npossibility is one of the disturbing morals of the book of `Job'. How \ncan we respect a God who allows children to be killed simply to test \nthe faith of Job?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mention of `Job' brings up the fact that there are few \nsourcebooks I can think of which are better than `God's Problem' for \nsetting up excellent programs for adult Bible study. One could \ndevelop at least two year-long study plans from the material in this \nbook. My only regret is that since it is directed at a lay audience, \nProfessor Ehrman includes relatively few bibliographical signposts, \nbut if you look carefully, you will find enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book is another voice in one of the greatest dialogues in \nWestern thought. I seriously hope someone picks up the conversation \nwith a reply done on the same level of scholarship and earnestness. \nProfessor Ehrman has obviously only addressed one side of the \ndialogue. So many `answers', such as the great philosopher Leibniz's \nsolution are hardly mentioned. Other major answers are provided by \nPascal and by theologian / philosophers such as Soren Kierkegaard.\u0014\nThis is a `must read' for those concerned with issues in Christian \nbeliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Cort, author of THE DOOR IS OPEN\u0014\nThis review is from: God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our \nMost Important Question--Why We Suffer (Hardcover) \u0014\n\u0014\nBart Ehrman's new book, `God's Problem', is a personal reflection on \nhuman suffering, conducted in the light of religious teachings that \nattempt to explain why so much suffering exists in the world. He \ntells us up front that this problem of suffering led him to question \nhis youthful faith in God (following a `born-again' experience in \nhigh school, he attended a fundamentalist Bible college, entered the \nministry, and received a Ph.D. in New Testament Studies from \nPrinceton), and eventually led him to embrace agnosticism. Throughout \nthese and other experiences, including many years as a Professor of \nReligion, he has heard pretty much every possible explanation for \nsuffering -- from simplistic `pat' answers to sophisticated \ntheological arguments, and just about everything in between.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne aspect of this book (and I can't quite decide if this is a \nstrength or a weakness), is his emotional retelling - over and over \nagain - of many examples of human suffering. He describes in grim \ndetail everything from the horrors of the Holocaust, the trench \nwarfare of WW1, the Black Plague, cancer, and AIDS, to reminders of \ninnocent children and adults who die painful deaths from accidents, \ntidal waves, and abuse, as well as the terrible suffering of loved \nones left behind. How, he wants to know, could an all-powerful and \nall-loving God permit so much pain? (I cannot decide whether this is \na strength or a weakness of the book because, on the one hand, it \noften feels emotionally manipulative as well as agonizingly \nrepetitive, but on the other hand it seems admirable and appropriate \nthat Ehrman refuses to deal with human pain in a sterile objective \nway, and he forces the reader to continually feel the misery, rather \nthan merely thinking about it intellectually.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the context of the Bible, Ehrman discusses several efforts to \nexplain, justify, or excuse this suffering, none of which he \nconsiders satisfactory:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) First, there is the idea expressed in many places in the Torah \nand the Prophets that suffering is divine punishment for sinful \nbehavior. People suffer because God wants them to suffer: he requires \nthem to pay a heavy price for disobedience. Ehrman brings up the \nHolocaust and other cases of genocide (including the contemporary \ncase of Darfur, which continues despite all the proclamations of \n\"Never again!\") and asks how a loving God could wish to inflict such \nexcessive suffering on his children? If a human father disciplined \nhis children with this much violence, he would be considered insane \nand thrown into prison. Furthermore, how could a loving God toss so \nmany innocent children, even babies, into these horrible scenarios of \nretribution? And finally, how does this explain all the people who do \nNOT seem to suffer, despite plenty of evidence that their behavior is \nno more saintly than anyone else's: why, for example, is there no \nTsunami in my hometown?\u0014\n\u0014\n(2) Second, there is the explanation that suffering is simply a \nnecessary consequence of free will. Without free will we would be \nmere robots, and God has lovingly created us to be far more that \nthis. Sadly, because people have the choice of loving God and \nbehaving morally, they also have the choice of doing otherwise, and \nsome will inevitably make this latter choice. The world would be a \nfar worse place if we did not have this gift of free will, so \nsuffering -- inflicted upon us by each other -- is the necessary \nprice we pay for this \"best of all possible worlds\". Of course, as \nEhrman points out, this explanation can make a certain amount of \nsense when considering the terror caused by a Hitler or a Stalin, but \nhow does free will explain a drought or a hurricane or malaria?\u0014\n\u0014\n(3) Third, there is the explanation that suffering can be redemptive, \na way to compensate and atone for sin, and thus it is a blessing in \ndisguise. Paul, for example, reveled in suffering: \"We even boast in \nour afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance, and \nendurance produces proven character; and a proven character produces \nhope...\"(Rom. 5:3). So for Paul, as well as many other Christian and \nHebrew authors, God chooses to `save' us not DESPITE our suffering, \nbut BECAUSE of our suffering. It is true, Ehrman admits, that \nsomething good often comes out of something bad: sometimes, what \ndoesn't kill us makes us stronger, as the old saying goes. But this \nis hardly a universal truth. \"A lot of times,\" he points out, \"what \ndoes not kill you completely incapacitates you, mars you for life, \nruins your mental or physical well-being - permanently\". To think \notherwise is to take a glib view of suffering. It is even worse, in \nEhrman's opinion, to consider OTHER people's suffering as somehow \nredemptive for me - that is, by recognizing the pain in the world, we \nbecome nobler, more caring, more grateful for our own well-being. But \nEhrman finds this view repugnant and cold-hearted, and refuses to \nthank a capricious God for his own good fortune simply because other \npeople don't have any.\u0014\n\u0014\n(4) Fourth, there is the explanation that suffering is a test of \nfaith. The story of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac is perhaps the \nmost famous example of this. Ehrman, like many people, finds this \nstory horrifying. \"Are we to imagine a divine being,\" he asks, \"who \nwants to torment his creatures just to see if he can force them to \nabandon their trust in him? What exactly are they trusting him to do? \nCertainly not to do what is best for them: it is hard to believe that \nGod inflicts people with cancer, flu, or AIDS in order to make sure \nthey praise him in the end. Praise him for what? Mutilation and \ntorture? For his great power to inflict pain and misery on innocent \npeople?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(5) Fifth, there is the post-exilic belief that the suffering in the \nworld is caused by God's `enemies' -- evil forces that oppose God's \nwill. Ehrman appreciates that this view at least takes seriously the \npervasiveness of evil and suffering in the world, but ultimately it \nis grounded in a rather fantastic belief that the world contains \n\"malevolent little devils\" who are intent on doing nasty things to \nus, and this simply does not jibe with reality. This view also \ncontains a corresponding belief that although God is allowing these \ndemons free rein today, the day is coming (and for more than two \nthousand years, it has been coming \"imminently\") when he will \ncompletely destroy these demons and establish the perfect Kingdom of \nGod here on earth -- free of evil, misery and pain. Ehrman has two \nobjections to this belief, in addition to its fantasy-like nature: \none, there is no explanation of why God has allowed these evil forces \nto be in control for all these years, representing a sort of \npassive-aggressive cruelty on his part; and two, the whole idea can \neasily lead to apathy in the face of human suffering, since \neventually it will all be made right without any required effort on \nour part.\u0014\n\u0014\n(6) Sixth, there is always the mystical cop-out that suffering is \nsimply a \"mystery\", and - its corollary -- we ought not to question \nthe ways of the Lord. The final verses of Job, for example, seem to \nadvocate this position. Again, the difficulty here is the problem of \napathy, since nothing can or should be done to stop the misery and \nmayhem that God chooses to cause. This approach implies the rather \ntwisted paradox that God, who created us and must therefore be the \ncause of our notions of `right and wrong', can go ahead and do all \nthose things which we therefore know are wrong - murdering babies, \nstarving masses of innocent people, etc. -- and we must acquiesce and \nkeep our mouths shut.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is another explanation that is somewhat related to this, \nwhich is represented in Ecclesiastes, and for Ehrman this is the best \nexplanation available to us. Indeed, there is much we do not \nunderstand about this world, and sometimes there is no justice. \n\"Things don't go as planned or as they should. A lot of bad things \nhappen.\" This, however, is not the whole story, for life also brings \nmany good things. Therefore, according to Ehrman, we needn't and \nmustn't fall into apathy. Rather, the solution to life \"is to enjoy \nit while we can, because it is fleeting. This world, and everything \nin it, is temporary, transient, and soon to be over. We won't live \nforever - in fact, we won't live long. And so we should enjoy life to \nthe fullest, as much as we can, as long as we can. That's what the \nauthor of Ecclesiastes thinks, and I agree.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEhrman concludes that a realization of the brevity and uncertainty of \nlife does not have to be a source of despair. It can be, instead, a \nsource of joy and dreams, \"joy of living for the moment and dreams of \ntrying to make the world a better place, both for ourselves and for \nothers in it.\" (I myself have been privileged to witness precisely \nthis phenomenon when working with people who had been diagnosed with \nAIDS. Rather than falling into depression and despair, many of these \nmen and women - suddenly and violently confronted with their \nmortality - grabbed hold of life and insisted on squeezing the \nabsolute most out of every moment). And this is where Ehrman leaves \nus: we should do all we can to make our time here as pleasing and \nwonderful and full of love and joy as possible, and we should also \nwork hard to bring about the same results, whenever possible, for \nothers. \"[J]ust because we don't have an answer to suffering does not \nmean that we cannot have a response to it. Our response should be to \nwork to alleviate suffering wherever possible and to live life as \nwell as we can.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI certainly have no quarrel with these two excellent endeavors, and \nwithin the context that Ehrman has set up I completely agree with his \nlogic, compassion, and conclusions: I would change nothing that he \nhas said. The `context' I refer to is his belief, which he mentions \nearly in the book, that his upbringing leads him to believe that if \nthere is a God then God is \"out there\" -- and he could influence our \nday-to-day material world, just as he supposedly did throughout \nbiblical history. But of course, as Ehrman concludes, if God is \"our \nthere\", is full of love, and has the power to do anything he wishes, \nthen something is terribly wrong! In one way or another, all this \nsuffering is God's responsibility, and after much serious \nconsideration Ehrman no longer finds it feasible or moral to believe \nin such a callous God.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither could I. But what if God is NOT \"out there\". What if God is \nto be found by searching and experiencing within oneself, rather than \nby looking for material evidence outside? This, I believe, is what \nMoses was trying to explain to the Israelites on the shores of the \nJordan River when he said, \"Surely, this instruction which I enjoin \nupon you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond \nreach. It is not in the heavens, that you should say, `Who among us \ncan go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us, that \nwe may observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should \nsay, `Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it \nfor us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing is \nvery close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it.\" \n(Deut.30.11-14). Similarly, this is what Jesus was trying to tell his \nfollowers when he said, \"The kingdom of God is not coming with things \nthat can be observed; nor will they say, `Look, here it is!' or \n`There it is!' For, in fact, the kingdom of God is within you.\" \n(Luke.17.20-21)\u0014\n\u0014\nBut we are held in thrall by the things of this world, our attention \ndispersed into the world around us, and we look for heaven and God \nprecisely where Moses and Christ tell us not to look, turning \nspirituality into the superficial and formalistic worship of external \nobjects and historical events. If the highest value (`God') and the \nlowest value (`Satan') are outside of us, then the soul is pretty \nmuch empty. As a result, God can only contact us from outside (`Show \nus proof!'), never from inside.\u0014\nAs our focus becomes more and more external, the lower rational mind \ngains strength and becomes more and more affronted by the \nirrationality of spiritual and religious claims. This is when the \nforces of atheism become increasingly vocal and adamant - not without \ncause. But if we turn our attention inward, and search for God in \nhigher levels of Being (which does not mean in higher `locations', \nbut rather, in higher `states of consciousness'), then perhaps it \nwould be possible, appropriate, and valuable, to add a third endeavor \nto the two which Ehrman mentions: (1) creating a loving relationship \nwith oneself, so that we do everything feasible to make our brief \ntime here as wonderful as possible; (2) creating a loving \nrelationship with our `neighbor', doing everything feasible to \nalleviate pain and suffering and bring as much joy as possible to \neveryone; and (3) creating a loving internal relationship with God, \nleading us toward spiritual enlightenment, and filling our inner \nlives with all the wonder and sense of fulfillment that come from a \nlife rich with faith and devotion, and the pursuit of spiritual truth \nand wisdom.\u0014",

    "words": "God or Man? Asks Nicea Council\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred and twelve bishops gathered. In the center of the room, \non a throne, lay the four gospels. The emperor himself, dressed in a \npurple gown and wearing a silver diadem, opened the council. It was \nhe who had called them together. \"I rejoice to see you here, yet I \nshould be more pleased to see unity and affection among you.\" The \nplace was Nicea. It was on this day, May 20, 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few days would be devoted primarily to one purpose: finding \na way to describe exactly who Jesus was. Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his controversial doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine \nwas alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more, some international, some regional. Those councils which \ncame after also grappled with issues of Christ's humanity and deity. \nWas he one person or two? Was he God while in his mother's womb? Did \nhe have just one will? Which books belong in the Bible? The seventh \necumenical church council was also held at Nicea.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

It was about \nmid-afternoon. He said, Ive been thinking for several hours about \ntaking a shower. Thats one of the worst things about chemotherapy, \nthe fatigue. Thinking about doing something is about as far as you \ncan get on most days. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo it was with me. I was about six months into the 13 months of my \nchemotherapy. I was able to do one thing a day. I never chose pulling \nweeds as my one thing. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo a lady from church was sitting on the walkway to our house, \npulling the weeds from the flower beds along the walk. She was good \nat it. She was about seventy, so shed had lots of experiences with \nweeds. I decided my one thing for the day would be to get up and go \nout to thank her. \u0014\n\u0014\nI had another motive to talk with her. I knew that her grandson, in \nhis early twenties, had moved in with her and her husband, come from \nanother state to do so. He was deep into drug addiction and had been \ndisowned by his parents and every rehab facility in several states. \nWhat do you do when no one else will have you? You go to Grandmas. \u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody says were crazy, she said. Nobody else has been able to \nhelp him. Why could we? Were old. But thats the point. I dont have \nmuch to look forward to, but I have a lot to look back at. I remember \nhim when I held him in my arms, when I rocked him when he cried, when \nwe played in the sand box, when I taught him how to ride a bike. I \ncant give up on all those memories. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was glad my one thing that day was listening to her memories, and \nrejoicing in her commitment. \u0014\n\u0014\nI understood what she was saying, but not really. I didnt have \ngrandchildren yet. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, though, I understand. Last night my first grandchild graduated \nfrom high school. She is beautiful. Last month she was prom queen. \nLast night she was awarded honors and scholarships. I watched her \nevery move with love and pride, with rejoicing for what she will \nbecome, but mostly with memories of what we have shared in the past. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I also scanned up and down the rows of the other graduates, \nlooking for that kid who is not beautiful, who received no honors or \nawards or scholarships, the one who will be tempted to make wrong \ndecisions and take wrong turns. I prayed for him, that he will have a \ngrandma who knows how to pull weeds \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland \u0014\njmcfarland1721@charter.net\u0014",

Iconically, his slight frame and his ancient, detached gaze \nstand for India as surely as the Taj Mahal. Yet Gandhi left India \nwhen he was barely 18, and thereafter visited only briefly until he \nreturned for good at the age of 45. It was South Africa, not India, \nthat made Gandhi who he was.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Had [Gandhi] not lived in South Africa, he might never have outgrown \nthe conventional, confined, views of Indian men of his class and his \ngeneration,\" writes Ramachandra Guha in his fluent and \nwell-researched biography of these years:\u0014\n\u0014\nHad Gandhi always lived or worked in India, he would never have met \ndissident Jews or Nonconformist Christians. Had he followed the \nfamily tradition and worked in a princely state in Kathiawar he would \nnever have met Tamils or North Indians. Had he practiced Law in \nBombay he could not have counted plantation workers or roadside \nhawkers among his clients.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuha, who is helpful on many aspects of Indian life, describes \nGandhi's Bania caste as belonging to cautious traders, merchants, and \nmoneylenders. Gandhi's moderately prosperous family had served in the \nadministration of princely states, wielding considerable power. \nHowever, Gandhi's father died before Gandhi came of age, so he had no \none to sponsor him for a similar job. He was an indifferent student; \nhe went to England (over the fervent objections of caste members, who \nregarded overseas travel as polluting) to get a law education because \nit promised an easier way to succeed. It did not prove so; Gandhi \nstruggled to make a living in India, and so was sent off to Durban to \nhelp a Muslim Indian trader involved in a complicated suit. Economic \nambition, not altruism, took Gandhi to South Africa on a temporary \nlegal assignment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he stayed on and prospered, moving into an attractive house in a \nEuropean neighborhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi Before India\u0014\nRamachandra Guha\u0014",

    "title": "GALILEO BEFORE THE INQUISITION",
    "words": "Galileo was frustrated. A web of deceit and hatred had closed around \nhim. As the sixty-nine year old man faced the Inquisition on this \nday, June 22, 1633, he hoped to get at least two changes in the \nstatement his judges insisted he sign. \"Do not make me say I have not \nbeen a good Catholic,\" he pleaded, \"for I have been one and will \nremain one no matter what my enemies say. And I will not say that I \nintended to deceive anyone, especially with the publication of my \nbook. I submitted it in good faith to the church censors and printed \nit only after legally obtaining a license.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judges agreed. They rewrote the words of his \"confession\"--as \nthey should have been. For, as Galileo knew, most of the men who were \nsentencing him held his same opinions--that the earth spun on its \naxis and orbited the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the new injunction before him, Galileo knelt and repeated the \nwords demanded of him. He was strongly \"suspected of heresy.\" He had \n\"held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and \nimmovable and that the Earth is not the center and moves...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then signed another statement. \"I, the said Galileo Galilei, \nhave abjured [renounced], sworn, promised and bound myself as above; \nand in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand \nsubscribed the present document of my abjuration and recited it word \nfor word at Rome, in the convent of the Minerva, this twenty-second \nday of June, 1633.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of the most famous trials in history. The church often \ntakes all the blame for the fiasco of justice that took place that \nday in Rome. It had the unfortunate effect of branding the Roman \nCatholic Church as anti-science, when in fact famous Catholics of the \nMiddle Ages (Grosseteste, Bradwardine, Oresme and others) had done \nmuch to advance and promote science. Galileo himself was a staunch \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt the church was in the wrong. A commission formed by \nPope John Paul II in the 1980s admitted as much. But was it fully \nresponsible? There were, in fact, two other parties at fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne was Galileo himself. His vanity, sarcastic words, contempt for \nlesser minds and half-truths had earned him fierce enemies among the \nintellectuals of Europe--especially among the Jesuits. Galileo even \nfudged at least one experiment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second set of culprits were naturalists (the scientists of the \nday). Advocates of the pagan philsopher Aristotle resisted Galileo's \nfindings. The pope and cardinals would not have acted if dozens of \nthese \"scientists\" had not said Galileo was wrong. Some hated \nGalileo, who had hurt their feelings. Others felt that Aristotle and \nthe Bible should not be overturned without solid evidence. It did not \nmatter that both Kepler and Galileo had shown that the Bible could be \ninterpreted to agree with the new science. Their own eyes showed them \nthat the sun, not the earth moves. Galileo could not provide hard \nevidence to the contrary. Solid proof for the earth's movement around \nthe sun was two hundred years away, when tiny shifts in star \npositions and subtle pendulum motions were finally measured.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillispie, Charles Coulston.

    "title": "GALILEO BEFORE THE INQUISITION",
    "words": "Galileo before the Inquisition\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo was frustrated. A web of deceit and hatred had closed around \nhim. As the sixty-nine year old man faced the Inquisition on this \nday, June 22, 1633, he hoped to get at least two changes in the \nstatement his judges insisted he sign. \"Do not make me say I have not \nbeen a good Catholic,\" he pleaded, \"for I have been one and will \nremain one no matter what my enemies say. And I will not say that I \nintended to deceive anyone, especially with the publication of my \nbook. I submitted it in good faith to the church censors and printed \nit only after legally obtaining a license.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judges agreed. They rewrote the words of his \"confession\"--as \nthey should have been. For, as Galileo knew, most of the men who were \nsentencing him held his same opinions--that the earth spun on its \naxis and orbited the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the new injunction before him, Galileo knelt and repeated the \nwords demanded of him. He was strongly \"suspected of heresy.\" He had \n\"held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and \nimmovable and that the Earth is not the center and moves...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then signed another statement. \"I, the said Galileo Galilei, \nhave abjured [renounced], sworn, promised and bound myself as above; \nand in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand \nsubscribed the present document of my abjuration and recited it word \nfor word at Rome, in the convent of the Minerva, this twenty-second \nday of June, 1633.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of the most famous trials in history. The church often \ntakes all the blame for the fiasco of justice that took place that \nday in Rome. It had the unfortunate effect of branding the Roman \nCatholic Church as anti-science, when in fact famous Catholics of the \nMiddle Ages (Grosseteste, Bradwardine, Oresme and others) had done \nmuch to advance and promote science. Galileo himself was a staunch \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt the church was in the wrong. A commission formed by \nPope John Paul II in the 1980s admitted as much. But was it fully \nresponsible? There were, in fact, two other parties at fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne was Galileo himself. His vanity, sarcastic words, contempt for \nlesser minds and half-truths had earned him fierce enemies among the \nintellectuals of Europe--especially among the Jesuits. Galileo even \nfudged at least one experiment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second set of culprits were naturalists (the scientists of the \nday). Advocates of the pagan philsopher Aristotle resisted Galileo's \nfindings. The pope and cardinals would not have acted if dozens of \nthese \"scientists\" had not said Galileo was wrong. Some hated \nGalileo, who had hurt their feelings. Others felt that Aristotle and \nthe Bible should not be overturned without solid evidence. It did not \nmatter that both Kepler and Galileo had shown that the Bible could be \ninterpreted to agree with the new science. Their own eyes showed them \nthat the sun, not the earth moves. Galileo could not provide hard \nevidence to the contrary. Solid proof for the earth's movement around \nthe sun was two hundred years away, when tiny shifts in star \npositions and subtle pendulum motions were finally measured.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillispie, Charles Coulston.

    "title": "GOD'S PROBLEM - BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "GOD'S PROBLEM  by Bart Ehrman\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Kevin Currie-Knight, reviewer\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, it must be said that this book is slightly mistitled. The \nproblem is the subtitle, which tells us that this will be a book \nabout \"how the Bible fails to answer our most important question.\" \nActually, the entire book is about exploring the various (and \nmultifarious) answers the bible gives in answer to why suffering \noccurs. Instead, the subtitle should read something more like, \"How \nthe bible fails to RESOLVE our most important problem.\" That would be \nmore accurate.\u0014\n \u0014\nEhrman used to be a Christian, he tells us. He used to aspire to be \nin the ministry. What undid that, he says, is this very question; \neach time he tried to decipher why an almighty and all powerful god \nwould allow suffering in the world, he came away deeply unsatisfied. \nIt is a question that has been around for ages: from Liebniz to Lewis \nand Chesterton.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, it is not that Ehrman cannot find answers in the bible to \nthis quesiton. There are many varied answers! Rather, none of them is \nsatisfying to Ehrman. This book goes through all of the bible's (old \nand new testament) answers to the problem of suffering. Do we suffer \nas penalty for our sins Do we suffer because all bad things somehow \nlead to good (ours or others)? Do we suffer simply because God wants \nto test our faith? Or because God will make things right in the \nafterlife?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese answers - all of them in various parts of the bible - are \nexplored. All of them, respectfully, are found wanting. Ehrman is not \na Christian, but is far from exercising the beligerence and acerbity \nof Dawkins and Harris. He says in his preface, after noting that his \nwife is Christian and that the two of them attend church together, \nthat he is not intending to \"deconvert\" anyone to his own \nagnosticism. He is simply explaining to many views of suffering and \nwhy, in the end, he sees all of them as unpalatable.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne criticism that I have is that while Ehrman exhaustively goes \nthrough the views of suffering that are in the bible, he devotes only \na final summative chapter to views of theologians attempting \nthemselves to make sense of this problem. When one is writing about a \nquestion that has captured the imaginations of as many thinkers as \nthis one, one should find it hard to do so without grappling with \ntheir thkoughts. Much has been written on this vexing question since \nthe bible, and it would have been nice for Ehrman to deal as much \nwith the post-biblical ruminations as those appearing in the bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo conclude, there is another slight misnomer about this book, though \nit is a small one. In the end, Ehrman actually does agree with ONE of \nthe Bible's interpretations of why we suffer. Not wanting to give a \n'spoiler,' I will not divulge which one, but I will only say that it \nis the one that would make most sense to a non-believer that \"black \nsheep\" book that seems more secular than religious (Christians may \nalready know to which book I am referring.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAll in all, this is a decent book, and it is good to see Ehrman \nwriting on so personal a subject - the subject that led to his, and \ndoubtless many others,' abandonment of Christianity. I hope, though, \nthat there will be a 'sequel' dealing with subsequent theologians \nattempts to deal with the question of evil.\u0014",

When they'd finished or nearly finished \nraising their kids, and faced the physical, emotional and spiritual \ntransitions of middle age, one or both parties in the marriage chose \nto walk away from the vows they made and the life they built \ntogether. In a few cases, I learned there was a secret life \n(addiction, adultery or abuse) that had persisted behind their closed \ndoors for years. In too many other cases, one partner asked for a \ndivorce with the bald words, I just don't love you any more.\u0014\n\u0014\nA recent Bowling Green State University study found that gray \ndivorce among people over 50 has increased by 52 percent over the \nlast 20 years. We're living longer, and the specter of spending an \nadditional three or four decades in a tired-out marriage has caused \nmany couples to split.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearcher Susan Brown noted, When marriages don't meet our needs or \nenhance our own personal well-being, many of us view divorce as \nacceptable. That mindset is something that now persists across the \ngenerations. Other researchers insist that life-long monogamy is a \nfalse religious construct, and insist that we humans are fighting our \nbiology by mating for life.\u0014",

What Prof. \nOpoku-Agyemang wanted to impress on us was the difference between the \nway Ghanaian and African-American cultures have processed the vast \ntrauma of slavery. He talked about American music, jazz, blues, \nhip-hop, and the achievements of African-American writers.

    "title": "GATEWAY TO FREEDOM: HISTORY OF UNDERGROUND RAILROAD",
    "words": "BOOK REVIEW:  GATEWAY TO FREEDOM: THE HIDDEN HISTOR OF THE \nUNDERGROUND RAILROAD\u0014\nby Eric Foner\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Vigilance Committee, which did not scruple to help \nfugitive slaves to places of safety, was a linchpin in the \nmaintenance of the Underground Railway. Central to the facts \npresented in GATEWAY TO FREEDOM by Pulitzer Prize winner Eric Foner \n(THE FIERY TRIAL: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery) is a new \ndisclosure of papers by Sydney Howard Gay, a New York abolitionist \nwho painstakingly recorded hundreds of escape accounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of an underground railroad came from the imagination of a \nslave who hoped to escape along it, in 1839. The term quickly caught \non, so much so that when the real railroads were in financial crisis, \nnewspapers enjoyed noting that the underground variety was the only \none not suffering the losses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Vigilance Committee was formed in 1835. In 1850, the (second) \nFugitive Slave Act made it incumbent on all US citizens to aid in the \nreturn of escaped property. This in turn made Gays journals \ntreasonable, so by one of those flukes that make scholarly research \nboth daunting and rewarding, it was only recently that Foner gained \naccess to them, after earlier investigators had concluded that these \nremarkable accounts, like similar materials, had been burned. Some of \nGays better-known subjects were Harriet Jacobs (who later wrote her \nown memoir, INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL), and Henry Box \nBrown, who himself had been crated and sent from Richmond to \nPhiladelphia in a container only three feet long, nearly suffocating \ntwice when his head was set downwards.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut equally moving are the tales collected by Gay and others of the \nthrongs of anonymous men, women and children who walked hundreds of \nmiles by night, in dark and dangerous forests, with no idea of \ngeography, hunted by patrols; or traveled as stowaways in a ships \nhold, reliant on the good will of the captain from whom they bought \ntheir passage --- always facing the possibility of capture and a \nreturn to far worse conditions than those they fled. One woman with a \nyoung daughter, hoping to join her escaped husband, hid in an \nexcavated dugout under a house with no means of light or \nventilation, Gay recorded, for five months.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough many abolitionists were Quakers (underground lore taught the \nescapees to recognize them by their square collars and thees and \nthous) who eschewed violence, others boldly urged newly freed \nslaves to use firearms in defense of their liberty. In all cases, \nthese idealistic citizens were acting in defiance of federal law but \nin concord with many state laws, and in accordance with their \npersonal morality. Meanwhile, President Lincoln could not suggest \nthat the slave owners did not have a legal right to reclaim their \nproperty as stated in the Act, but deeply felt the plight of captives \nlonging for release; he once wrote, I bite my lip and keep quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoners detailed histories --- of the slaves who left the South \nseeking freedom, and those on the Northern side who determinedly \nassisted them --- brings the courage, charity and vision of both \ngroups to light and life.\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book chronicles the functioning and challenges of the ad hoc \nUnderground Railroad system, and puts it in the context of the \noverall Abolition movement as well as documenting how the support for \nfugitive (ex) slaves became another hotpoint between the North and \nSouth.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike another reviewer, I wish more detail were spent on individuals \nparticipating in the struggle, as opposed to often tersely \ndocumenting the roles of so many. For instance, why would a wealthy \nsilk merchant become such an ardent abolitionist? Other characters \ngetting passing reference, more for their particular role in a \ncommittee or like, but seeming fascinating -- fugitives who became \nleaders of the committees; a Black pastor of a mostly white \ncongregation, etc.. I'm sure many of these are hard to find \ninformation about; but I thought to really explain the railroad, it \nwould help to understand the lives of individuals who participated in \nit, and understanding a few would help to understand the many.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my recollection, only one or two characters merit much examination \nof their personal lives. Saying that one person simply found it via \n\"evangelical Christianity\" doesn't help much, when many other \nChristians didn't follow suit. Instead, there is a good amount of \ndiscussion of the bickering between the various committees. I wish \ninstead of documenting committees, there had been more discussion of \nthe black communities (other than their numbers) in places like New \nYork City and Canada. Since this is where slaves fled to, it seems \nworth understanding that piece of their story.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving written my critique, the book is well written, and it made me \nthink of other current issues -- gay marriage, abortion, marijuana, \nand now \"Selma\" -- which seem similar in the sense of a schism \nbetween the states; the enforcement (sometimes extreme) and \nnon-enforcement elsewhere of laws; the use of arcane regulations or \nbiased administrators; the use of courts and Congress to try to push \nthe law one way or another. All this played out earlier, and I think \none of the book's contributions is to point out how the escape of \nslaves undermined any portrayal of slavery as a \"caring\" institution, \nand, forced people to confront the issue and develop a point of view \non the issue. In the North, it was to push out the remaining \n\"loopholes\" over time; in Congress, well, Congress is Congress; and \nin the South, alas, it hardened (or simply provided realism) that the \nNorth would act against slavery as it could. This seems similar to \nour current situation in many cases.\u0014\n-----------------------------------------------\u0014\nThe phrase \"Underground Railroad\" conjures up images of escaped \nslaves fleeing through woods and swamps, crossing perilous rivers, \ngetting assistance from kind-hearted farmers' families, and crossing \nthe border to Canada. While there is much truth in that stereotype, \nhistorian Eric Foner presents a much more complex picture in Gateway \nto Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoner, a historian at Columbia University, focuses much of his \nattention on the activities of the underground railroad in New York \nCity. Drawing on some previously unexamined records kept by \norganizations aiding fugitive slaves, Foner details the work of \nsometimes competing, sometimes cooperating groups. I found it \ninteresting that the work of the Underground Railroad was so varied. \nFor example, one point of contention was the support of helping \nescaped slaves get to freedom as opposed to working toward \"making \ntheir own soil free.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though major Underground Railroad groups worked in New York, New \nYork was not necessarily a great place for anti-slavery activists or \nfor former slaves. Much of the business of southern agriculture and \ntrade went through the financial houses of New York; they were not \nclamoring for the end of slavery. Slave hunters moved freely about \nthe city, entering private homes and churches to find their prey. As \nin many other places, free blacks were regularly kidnapped and sold \ninto slavery, as in Twelve Years a Slave.\u0014\n\u0014\nGateway to Freedom is very readable; it's not written only for the \nscholar or professional historian. However, the stories Foner tells \nof the experiences of the slaves are too short to satisfy the reader \nlooking for drama. There is so much drama to be found here. Any one \nof the stories he hints at could be a gripping movie or book. But \ndrama is not his purpose. He provides context and structure to what \nwe think of as the Underground Railroad. It's not as simple as is \npopularly thought, but turns out to be much more interesting and \nreal. Foner is to be commended for adding to body of knowledge of \nthis troubling, but important and inspiring, chapter in American \nhistory.\u0014",

    "title": "GEORGE WASHINGTON, SLAVE CATCHER",
    "words": "George Washington, Slave Catcher\u0014\nBy ERICA ARMSTRONG DUNBAR      FEB. 16, 2015   NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nAMID the car and mattress sales that serve as markers for Presidents \nDay, Black History Month reminds Americans to focus on our common \nhistory. In 1926, the African-American historian Carter G. Woodson \nintroduced Negro History Week as a commemoration built around the \nbirthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Now February \nserves as a point of collision between presidential celebration and \nmarginalized black history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Lincolns role in ending slavery is understood to have been \nmore nuanced than his reputation as the great emancipator would \nsuggest, it has taken longer for us to replace stories about cherry \ntrees and false teeth with narratives about George Washingtons \nslaveholding.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was 11 years old, Washington inherited 10 slaves from his \nfathers estate. He continued to acquire slaves  some through the \ndeath of family members and others through direct purchase. \nWashingtons cache of enslaved people peaked in 1759 when he married \nthe wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis. His new wife brought more \nthan 80 slaves to the estate at Mount Vernon. On the eve of the \nAmerican Revolution, nearly 150 souls were counted as part of the \nproperty there.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1789, Washington became the first president of the United States, \na planter president who used and sanctioned black slavery. Washington \nneeded slave labor to maintain his wealth, his lifestyle and his \nreputation. As he aged, Washington flirted with attempts to extricate \nhimself from the murderous institution  to get quit of Negroes, as \nhe famously wrote in 1778. But he never did.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the presidents two terms in office, the Washingtons relocated \nfirst to New York and then to Philadelphia. Although slavery had \nsteadily declined in the North, the Washingtons decided that they \ncould not live without it. Once settled in Philadelphia, Washington \nencountered his first roadblock to slave ownership in the region  \nPennsylvanias Gradual Abolition Act of 1780.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe act began dismantling slavery, eventually releasing people from \nbondage after their 28th birthdays. Under the law, any slave who \nentered Pennsylvania with an owner and lived in the state for longer \nthan six months would be set free automatically. This presented a \nproblem for the new president.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington developed a canny strategy that would protect his property \nand allow him to avoid public scrutiny. Every six months, the \npresidents slaves would travel back to Mount Vernon or would journey \nwith Mrs. Washington outside the boundaries of the state. In essence, \nthe Washingtons reset the clock. The president was secretive when \nwriting to his personal secretary Tobias Lear in 1791: I request \nthat these Sentiments and this advise may be known to none but \nyourself & Mrs. Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe president went on to support policies that would protect slave \nowners who had invested money in black lives. In 1793, Washington \nsigned the first fugitive slave law, which allowed fugitives to be \nseized in any state, tried and returned to their owners. Anyone who \nharbored or assisted a fugitive faced a $500 penalty and possible \nimprisonment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington almost made it through his two terms in office without a \nmajor incident involving his slave ownership. On a spring evening in \nMay of 1796, though, Ona Judge, the Washingtons 22-year-old slave \nwoman, slipped away from the presidents house in Philadelphia. At \n15, she had joined the Washingtons on their tour of Northern living. \nShe was among a small cohort of nine slaves who lived with the \npresident and his family in Philadelphia. Judge was Martha \nWashingtons first attendant; she took care of Mrs. Washingtons \npersonal needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat prompted Judges decision to bolt was Martha Washingtons plan \nto give Judge away as a wedding gift to her granddaughter. Judge fled \nPhiladelphia for Portsmouth, N.H., a city with 360 free black people, \nand virtually no slaves. Within a few months of her arrival, Judge \nmarried Jack Staines, a free black sailor, with whom she had three \nchildren. Judge and her offspring were vulnerable to slave catchers. \nThey lived as free people, but legally belonged to Martha Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington and his agents pursued Judge for three years, dispatching \nfriends, officials and relatives to find and recapture her. Twelve \nweeks before his death, Washington was still actively pursuing her, \nbut with the help of close allies, Judge managed to elude his \nslave-catching grasp.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington died on Dec. 14, 1799. At the time of his death, \n318 enslaved people lived at Mount Vernon and fewer than half of them \nbelonged to the former president. Washingtons will called for the \nemancipation of his slaves following the death of his wife. He \ncompleted in death what he had been unwilling to do while living, an \nact made easier because he had no biological children expecting an \ninheritance. Martha Washington lived until 1802 and upon her death \nall of her human property went to her inheritors. She emancipated no \none.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked by a reporter if she had regrets about leaving the \nWashingtons, Judge responded, No, I am free, and have, I trust, been \nmade a child of God by the means. Ona Judge died on Feb. 25, 1848. \nShe has earned a salute during the month of February.\u0014\n\u0014\nErica Armstrong Dunbar, an associate professor of black studies and \nhistory at the University of Delaware, is the author of A Fragile \nFreedom: African American Women and Emancipation in the Antebellum \nCity. \u0014\n\u0014\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on February 16, 2015, on \npage A17 of the New York edition with the headline: George \nWashington, Slave Catcher\u0014",

    "words": "Jurors: Life sentence in \ngirl's running death \u0014\n\u0014\nGADSDEN, Ala. (3/28/15) - A jury recommended life without parole \nThursday for an Alabama woman convicted of running her granddaughter \nto death.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jurors rejected prosecutors' pleas for a death sentence for Joyce \nHardin Garrard in the February \u0014\n2012 death of' 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. The decision came on a \nsplit vote: seven for life, five for \u0014\ndeath. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Alabama law, a vote of at least 10 of 12 jurors was required \nfor the panel to recommend \u0014\ndeath. A simple majority could recommend life.\u0014\n\u0014\n The verdict is only a suggestion under Alabama law. Circuit Judge \nBilly Ogletree will make the \u0014\nfinal sentencing decision at a hearing May 11 and could still impose \ndeath, but prosecutors said they \u0014\nwouldn't ask him to over-ride jurors.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalker says Garrard hasn't shown remorse for the death of 9-year-old \nSavannah Hardin.\u0014\nProsecutors say Garrard brutally made the girl run for hours as \npunishment for a lie until she collapsed into seizures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, is charged with murder \nand awaiting a separate trial for allegedly sitting by as Garrard \nmade the child run for hours. No one is saying whether Hardin will \ntestify, but prosecutors have subpoenaed her as a potential witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe state also issued a subpoena for Robert Hardin, Savannah's father \nand the son of Joyce Garrard, and Garrard's husband Johnny Garrard.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Hardin filed a malpractice suit last year blaming his \ndaughter's death on mistakes at Gadsden Regional Medical Center, \nwhere the girl was rushed immediately after collapsing outside the \nfamily home on a big, wooded lot in rural Etowah County.\u0014\n\u0014\nClaims made in Hardin's lawsuit -- that medical workers failed to \nproperly treat the girl for low sodium levels after her collapse -- \nare similar to defense arguments from pretrial hearings. But jurors \nmay never hear any of it: The judge is considering a state request \nthat would limit medical testimony and could hamper the defense's \ncase.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors contend Garrard made the child run and carry wood for \nabout three hours as punishment for a lie about eating chocolate. A \nschool bus videotape captured the woman saying she planned to run the \nchild \"`til she can't run no more,\" prosecutor Marcus Reid told a \njudge during a hearing in 2012.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's exactly what she did,\" said Reid calling Garrard a \"drill \nsergeant from hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities said the grandmother became angry when Savannah allegedly \nate chocolate, which contains caffeine, because the girl's condition \nmeant she couldn't have the substance.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefense attorney Dani Bone countered that Garrard's words were empty \nrhetoric from a woman who had no intention of doing anything to harm \nthe child. Savannah's health problems and treatment decisions \nfollowing her collapse led to her death, the defense maintains.\u0014",

    "title": "GOD OR MAN? ASKS NICEA COUNCIL",
    "words": "God or Man? Asks Nicea Council\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred and twelve bishops gathered. In the center of the room, \non a throne, lay the four gospels. The emperor himself, dressed in a \npurple gown and wearing a silver diadem, opened the council. It was \nhe who had called them together. \"I rejoice to see you here, yet I \nshould be more pleased to see unity and affection among you.\" The \nplace was Nicea. It was on this day, May 20, 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few days would be devoted primarily to one purpose: finding \na way to describe exactly who Jesus was. Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his controversial doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine \nwas alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more, some international, some regional. Those councils which \ncame after also grappled with issues of Christ's humanity and deity. \nWas he one person or two? Was he God while in his mother's womb? Did \nhe have just one will? Which books belong in the Bible? The seventh \necumenical church council was also held at Nicea.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "God Loved Alexander Hamilton\u0014\n                                                 But did this \nparticular Founding Father love God? \u0014\n\u0014\nSusan Lim/ February 15, 2016  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Alexander Hamilton was born back in 1755, he was already behind \nthe eight ball. Whispers of illegitimacy plagued him from birth as \nthe product of a common law marriage between James Hamilton and the \nnotorious Rachel Faucette (the only woman imprisoned at St. Croixs \nFort Christiansvaern for committing adultery). His father was no \nbetter. Known as the black sheep of the family, James Hamilton \ndeserted his wife and children when Alexander was 10. Several years \nlater, Alexander transitioned from bastard to orphan when his mother \ndied.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a true rags-to-riches story, Hamiltons ascent out of poverty and \ninto the political limelight reveals that miracles do happen. \nRecently, his incredible life has been recounted in the hit musical \nHamilton. Inspired by Ron Chernows biography on the first treasury \nsecretary, composer Lin-Manuel Miranda brilliantly captures the highs \nand lows of this orphan boy who became a war hero, architect of \nAmericas financial system, and George Washingtons confidante and \nindispensable aide. Chernows storytelling powers are formidable, and \npoint, perhaps unbeknownst, to the greatest Storyteller of all.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hundreds of pages that inspired the musical, a reverberant \ntheme resounds throughout: that God loved this destitute orphan and \nopened doors for him. His rise parallels the story of a shepherd boy \nwho became king. And like King David, General Alexander Hamilton had \nhis own adulterous affair, political coup, and preventable tragedies. \nYet Gods tender heart and longsuffering kindness were woven \nthroughout Hamiltons 49 years on this earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat God loved Alexander Hamilton is undeniable. But did Hamilton \nlove God? Historians of the Revolutionary period are often asked \nabout issues of faith. Did the Founding Fathers believe in God? Were \nthey really Christians? For Alexander Hamilton, the answer was yes. \nRecords indicate that Hugh Knox, a Presbyterian minister in St. \nCroix, influenced Hamilton at a young age. Knoxs sermons and passion \nfor God seemed to have affected Hamilton on a fundamentally core \nlevel. Hamiltons own desire to pursue godly living was ignited in \nSt. Croix, and he carried this aspiration with him when he set sail \nfor New York to further his education.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a student at Kings College (Columbia University today), his \nfellow classmates commented on Hamiltons sincere heart for worship \nand that he often went above the prescribed prayers and mandatory \nchapels. Chernow writes that Robert Troup, Hamiltons classmate at \nKings, confessed he had often been powerfully affected by the \nfervor and eloquence of [Hamiltons] prayers and that Hamilton was \na zealous believer in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike most faith journeys, Hamiltons ebbed and flowed between \nskepticism and belief. But at the end, his verdict was clear: I have \nexamined carefully the evidence of the Christian religion, and if I \nwas sitting as a juror upon its authenticity, I should rather \nabruptly give my verdict in its favor.\u0014\n\u0014\nHamiltons analytical mind sought for proofs of religion and not \nmerely emotional satisfaction. He studied A View of the Evidences of \nChristianity in search of reasonable answers to an elusive faith. As \na child of the Enlightenment and relentless pursuer of the truth, \nHamilton despised religious fanaticism and searched for logical \nproofs. With the legal mind and intellectual tenacity he applied to \nthe US Constitution and Federalist papers, Hamilton surveyed the \nScriptures and religious evidence. I have studied [Christianity] and \nI can prove its truth as clearly as any proposition ever submitted to \nthe mind of man, he concluded.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo make such a declaration was not easy. Enlightenment ideals had \nswept into the colonies decades earlier, and Deism contended against \ntraditional Christianity in fundamental ways. The world that Hamilton \nand the other Founding Fathers inhabited was a vastly different one \nthan the Puritans of yore. From the time that John Winthrop famously \ncharged his fellow Puritans to shine as a Citty upon a Hill in \n1630, almost 150 years had passed by the time of the Revolution. Much \nlike our society is unrecognizable from the one during the Civil War \n(which took place about 150 years ago), Puritan traditions had \nlargely vanished by the time the British and colonists went to war.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first three American presidents and fellow Founding Fathers, \nGeorge Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, each went \nthrough their own personal faith journeys in the same \nEnlightenment-fused world. Historians have yet to reach a consensus \non these Founders faiths, as some attest that they were Deists, some \nclaim that they were committed Christians, and others argue that they \nfell somewhere in between. Whatever the verdict, an interesting theme \nmay be noted in the spiritual lives of these Founding Fathers: their \nchildhood experiences of religious matters seem to have influenced \ntheir outlook on God for their lifetimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washingtons upbringing in an Anglican home, led by a \nspiritually mindful mother, secured a religious anchor throughout his \ndays. Washingtons nephew purportedly saw the first president \nkneeling with an open Bible both in the mornings and evenings for \npersonal devotions; and prayer seemed to be a vital component of \nWashingtons life. Perhaps these were disciplines that he learned as \na youth. Although Washington was generally private about religious \naffairs, he was a committed Anglican and served as vestryman and \nwarden at Pohick Church. Yet, he seemed to spurn Holy Communion and \nrarely mentioned Jesus Christ, preferring the name of Providence \nto describe God. Washington was convinced that Providence beckoned \nmankind to participate in human affairs, but still retained \nsovereignty. And Providence was anything but passive, as Washington \nfirmly believed that God personally attended the creation of the \nUnited States.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashingtons successor, John Adams, was born into a devout Christian \nfamily and raised to carry on Puritan traditions. The second \npresident of the United States never wavered away from his faith, nor \ndid he ever see any conflict in being both an independent thinker and \ncommitted Christian. As David McCullough recounts in his Pulitzer \nPrize-winning biography, Adams regularly boasted of his Puritan \nancestry, sometimes bordered on legalism (he often refused to travel \non the Sabbath), and occasionally cast stones against those he deemed \nless spiritual than himself. For example, Adams made it a point to \nhighlight Jeffersons nontraditional religious convictions when they \nboth vied for the presidency. Other Federalists, the party of Adams, \ncaught on and printed in newspapers a stark choice: God and a \nReligious President or Jefferson and no God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly Jefferson was not an atheist, even though the political \nmudslinging might suggest otherwise. Jeffersons upbringing indicates \nthat his childhood years focused primarily on culling his \nintellectual abilities and religious instruction was more of an \nacademic, and not personalized, endeavor. Jefferson was classically \ntrained and fluent in Greek and Latin at a young age and attended \nboarding school at the age of nine. Jefferson seemed to have a \nstrained and distant relationship with his mother, but adored his \nfather. Peter Jefferson, unfortunately, died when Thomas was 14. The \nelder Jefferson taught his son many virtues before his death, but \nreligious affection for Christ does not appear to be one of them. \nAlthough Jefferson called himself a Christian, he did not believe in \nthe Trinity nor the infallibility of Scripture. As historian Joyce \nAppleby writes, he famously took a pair of scissors and cut out the \ncorrupted dross in parts of the New Testament and created his own \nversion of the Gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor these three presidents, and Hamilton as well, their early \nreligious experiences seem to greatly influence their theological \ninclinations as adults. These heroic men have gone on to inspire \ntomes of books, endless dialogues, and now, even musicals. In \naddition to their contributions to democracy and history, we see the \npower of their enduring faith. May our Founding Fathers be a reminder \nthat illegitimate orphans can be world leaders, and thatdespite the \nquestions and challenges that comeyoung hearts are ripe soil to \nplant the love of our Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\nSusan Lim is an assistant professor of history at Biola University. \nHer research interests include religious developments in America \nduring the Colonial and Revolutionary periods. She resides in Irvine, \nCalifornia with her husband and two children.\u0014",

    "title": "GRACE: TRANSACTIONAL OR TRANSFORMATIONAL?",
    "words": "READING THE BIBLE TODAY: Grace: TRANSACTIONAL OR TRANSFORMATIONAL?\u0014\nby Mark E. Biddle\u0014\n\u0014\nMark E. Biddle, Dr.Theol (Zrich), is Russell T. Cherry Professor of \nOld Testament at Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond. He has \nauthored six books, ten translations, and more than 150 articles, \nreviews, and lectures. He is editor of R&E, and of the Reading the \nOld Testament (Smyth & Helwys) and the Smyth & Helwys commentaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time of year means preparation for facing first year students. \nMost have never engaged in rigorous academic study of the Bible. They \ncome to seminary as I came to my undergraduate religion major, \ninnocently expecting that the Bible says what they have always \nthought it said and that serious study of it will only confirm what \nthey already believe. My calling asks me to nudge and cajole, nurture \nand confront my students to read the text. It is impossible \ncompletely to set aside ones assumptions and convictions in order to \nopen oneself to new insights, I know, because after decades of \nstudying scripture academically and devotionally as my lifes work, \nthe Bible still surprises and shocks me regularly.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, while working on my commentary on Judges, I realized \nthat for over twenty years I had wrongly been teaching what I had \nbeen taught about the theme of the book instead of what the book \nitself says. Scholars identify in Judg 2:6ff. what they term the \nDeuteronomistic Paradigm of Israels history. It offers the scheme \nthat the authors/editors of the six volumes that comprise the Former \nProphets section of the Hebrew Bible, a section also known to \nscholarship as the Deuteronomistic History. According to the scheme, \nIsraels history since at least Joshuas death (but arguably reaching \nas far back as the Golden Calf episode) manifested a repetitive cycle \nin four phases: (1) Israel sinned by worshipping strange gods; (2) \nGod handed them over to their enemies; (3) Israel cried out \n(Hebr. z`q) in their distress; (4) God raised up a deliverer. After a \nperiod, the cycle then repeated.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor decades, I taught that this paradigm involved Israels repentance \nas part of phase three. The literature on Judges, the Deuteronomistic \nParadigm, and the Deuteronomistic History assumes that Israel must \nhave repented. I assumed it, too. Otherwise, God would not have sent \na deliverer. Unfortunately, that is not at all what the text says. \nInstead, the text seems intentionally to allude to Gods response to \nIsraels distressed cry (Hebr. z`q) in Egyptian bondage (Exod 2:24) \nthat prompted God to remember Gods covenant/promise to Israels \nancestors. In fact, the verb used in both contexts connotes a cry for \nassistance, not a cry of despair or of repentance. According to the \ntext, God sent deliverers (Moses, then the judges) in every case, not \nbecause Israel had improved its attitude and changed its behavior, \nbut because God was moved by their plight and Gods original promise \nto their ancestors. As when God called Abraham, God acted purely out \nof grace. There was no transaction: Repent first, earn it, and then \nI will deliver you.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus offered grace in the same way. From afar, ten lepers, one a \nSamaritan, called upon Jesus to show them mercy. He told them to \npresent themselves to the priests and, as they departed to do so, \nthey were healed. Only one, a Samaritan, paused to thank Jesus. Not \none word passed between Jesus and these ten about repentance or even \nabout becoming disciples. Grace transforms people; it does not \nrequire people first to conform to some expectation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not a Calvinist (see Making Theological Trouble for \nOurselves), but I do find truth in the Calvinist doctrine of \nprevenient grace, the notion that Gods grace comes before \neverything else in our relationship to God. We can love God only \nbecause God first loved us  when we were most unlovable (Rom 5:8).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy, then, do we find it so difficult to emulate God in extending \ngrace? I once served a church that would not allow youth to go along \non youth outings unless they had accumulated a minimum of points \nawarded for attending church, Sunday school, and youth group \nmeetings. People use the very popular slogan about loving sinners but \nhating sins to conceal the fact that they are unwilling fully to \nextend grace to categories of people until these people conform to \nsome standard. The lepers did not first become well in order to \nreceive Jesus grace. Jesus grace made them well.\u0014\n\u0014\nConveniently, of course, the sins people hate are always someone \nelses. The slogan also conceals the fact that no one can cast the \nfirst stone. All of us receive Gods grace while we [are] yet \nsinners (Rom 5:8).\u0014\n\u0014\nCan it be that those outside the church look at all of us who profess \nthe Gospel as hypocrites because of our tendencies to use grace \ntransactionally? to offer it on a quid pro quo basis? to withhold it \nuntil the other party deserves it in our eyes? Such attitudes deny \nthe very essence of grace  the fact that it is always undeserved.\u0014",

In the pages of the \nMacon Daily Telegraph, ads touted toys and sweets, books and jewelry, \nall at bargain prices. In a large front-page ad, the store of H.N. \nElls & Co., on Mulberry Street, reminded readers that Old \nSanta-Clauz was coming to town, and urged upon them such last-minute \nstocking stuffers as apples, figs, candy, and firecrackers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the next page of that Christmas Eve newspaper was a more discreet \nadvertisement, this one just five lines of small print:\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                \nFOR SALE.\u0014\n\u0014\nA NEGRO WOMAN 21 years old, and her daughter about six years old.

In Easton, Md., Negro Henry, Aged \nabout 26 years, and Negro George, aged about 19 years, were offered \nat private sale until the 25th inst.  that is, until Christmas Day. \nIn Washington, D.C., just a few blocks from the White House, one \nowner advertised a servant girl, seventeen years of age  a slave \nfor life. In the Christmas morning edition of the Augusta (Ga.) \nChronicle, the local sheriff announced the upcoming sale of a \nMulatto Boy slave named Charles, about 14 years of age. The lad, \nwho had been seized from his mistress to satisfy debts, was to be put \nup for public auction in the town market on New Year's Day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last weeks of each December were a strange and frightening time \nto be a slave in America. (Was there ever a normal time, however?) In \nthe antebellum period, the end of the calendar year was  as it is \nnow  a busy period for financial transactions. Assets were \nliquidated, debts settled, taxes paid, balance sheets scrutinized. \nAny of these might lead a slaveholder to divest himself of some human \nproperty. Based on the evidence in contemporary newspapers, New \nYear's Day slave auctions like the one in Augusta were common.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe estimated five to 10 percent of American slaves who were rented \nfrom one master to another (in some regions the figure was more than \n60 percent) had their own reasons to be terrified. Jan. 1 was when \nold rental contracts expired and slaves' services were auctioned off \nfor the year ahead, sending them to different, often far-flung, \nplantations. One former bondsman would recall how each New Year's \nDay, the cries and tears of brothers, sisters, wives, and husbands \nwere heard in the streets as black families were separated  at \nleast for twelve months, but possibly forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, surreally enough, Christmas was a time when many \nmasters encouraged their slaves to eat, drink, and be merry. Field \nhands were commonly given the entire week as a holiday  their only \none of the year. South Carolina Senator James Henry Hammond  who did \nnot hesitate to rape female slaves and to lash servants with his own \nhand  distributed gifts throughout the quarters, and noted in his \njournal that on Christmas, a barbecue is given, beef, mutton, and \npork, coffee and bread being bountifully provided. On the morning of \nDec. 25, right after opening presents and emptying stockings, masters \nwould bring their families down to the slave cabins to watch blacks \nperform dances and songs that had been handed down from Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My documents/Ghosts of a Christmas Past\u0014",

At the end of the Kali Yuga, the \npresent world will be destroyed and cleansed, and a new era of peace \nand enlightenment will dawn.\u0014\n\u0014\nmillennium \u0014\n1.\tAny period of a thousand years. \u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tAn epoch of a thousand years in the modern Western calendar. The \nthird millennium will begin on January 1, 2001. \u0014\n\u0014\n3.\t(usually capitalized) The supposed thousand year reign of Christ \nafter his Second Coming. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNew World Order \u0014\nA phrase first used by Mikhail Gorbachev on December 7, 1988 in an \naddress to the United Nations. It originally meant a world no longer \ndominated by two great superpowers, in which world peace would be \nenforced through international efforts, a very positive idea indeed. \nThe phrase was relatively unknown in popular culture until George \nBush used it during a speech to Congress on September 11, 1990. \nAlmost immediately, fundamentalists and conspiracy buffs latched onto \nthe phrase, twisting its meaning to represent an evil worldwide \nconspiracy to form a single body that will govern the world through \ndeception, an iron fist and possible Satanic influence. The phrase \nquickly replaced the \"One-World Government\", \"New Order\" and \n\"International Jewish Banking Conspiracy\" favored by conspiracy \nparanoiacs. Writings prior to 1990 that refer to a \"New World Order\" \nare rare indeed. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum as seen on the \ndollar bill actually means \"a new order of the ages,\" not \"New World \nOrder\" as some paranoiacs would have people think.\u0014\n\u0014\nParousia \u0014\nTechnical term for the Second Coming of Christ\u0014\n\u0014\npyramidology \u0014\nA pseudoscience that teaches that the Great Pyramid of Giza is a \ndivine revelation. Many pyramidologists believe that the future can \nbe foretold by measuring the Great Pyramid's inner passages.\u0014\n\u0014\nRapture \u0014\nThe sudden transporation of all true Christians to heaven, which is \nsupposed to take place around the time of the Second Coming of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond Coming \u0014\nThe return of Jesus to Earth, a doctrine believed by many Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nsigns of the times \u0014\nPhenomena occurring that supposedly signal that the end is near. \nThese include self-proclaimed Messiahs, wars and rumors of war, \nnation rising against nation, famines andearthquakes (Matthew 24). \nThe problem, naturally, is that such things have been happening \nconstantly throughout history, even before the time of Christ. And \neven Jesus was wrong about the Temple being destroyed such that \n\"there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be \nthrown down.\" (Matthew 24:2) The Western Wall of the Temple is still \nintact to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nTEOTWAWKI \u0014\nCommonly used shorthand for \"the end of the world as we know it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTribulation \u0014\nA period, generally thought to be seven years, in which the \nAntichrist comes to power, and the world is destroyed by war, \ndisease, rampant crime, earthquakes, and other nastiness. The \nTribulation is supposed to take place immediately before Christ's \nMillennium.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nSay what you will about the Obama administration's policies- \u0014\nand over the past eight years we have said a great deal, not much of \u0014\nit favorable - the president and his family have been stellar models \u0014\nof personal conduct and dignity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat personal rectitude makes the unhinged comments of Carl \u0014\nPaladino, an adviser to president -elect Donald Trump, all the more \u0014\nmystifying. In response to questions from a magazine shortly before \u0014\nChristmas - that season of spiritual harmony and brotherly love \u0014\n- Paladino said he hoped Obama would catch mad cow disease \u0014\nafter \"having relations with a Hereford,\" then die of it and be bur- \u0014\nied next to his adviser, Valerie Jarrett, after she was beheaded by \nan \u0014\nIslamic radical. As for Michele Obama, Paladino wished she would \u0014\n\"return to being a male\" and be \"let loose in the outback ofZimba- \u0014\nbwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was too much even for Team Trump, which heretofore has \u0014\nnot been known for its delicate sensibilities. Trump has a reputa- \u0014\ntion for boorishness, exemplified by his caught -on- tape comments \u0014\nabout grabbing women by the privates and by his habit of hurling \u0014\ninsults at anyone who challenges him. But a spokesman called \u0014\nPaladino's comments \"utterly reprehensible.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe role of civility in politics is not a new question. When it comes \u0014\nup, one sometimes sees references to earlier eras in American history \u0014\n- when politicians such as Jefferson, Adams, Jackson, Lincoln and \u0014\ntheir foes and surrogates accused one another of promoting incest, \u0014\nbeing a hermaphrodite, engaging in prostitution or pimpery and so on. \u0014\nThe references to such historical calumnies carry two implications. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is that today' s political debates are no more uncivil than \nthose \u0014\nof decades past, which is true. The second is that we can expect \nnothing \u0014\nbetter - which is false. Contemporary politicians from Ronald Reagan \u0014\nto George H.w. Bush to Obama have managed to fight hard without \u0014\nflinging verbal excrement. It can be done. It's not even all that \nhard. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough it seems improbable at this point, Trump could follow \u0014\ntheir lead and strike a blow for civil public discourse by publicly \u0014\nsevering ties with Paladino. The country has more than enough \u0014\ncomment -section trolls on the internet. It doesn't need any in the \u0014\nvicinity of the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEditorial in Richmond Times Dispatch, January, 1917\u0014",

    "words": "Christians in Sierra Leone are still reeling and recovering from the \nworst flooding their West African nation has faced in recent memory, \nafter a mudslide covered homes and churches on the outskirts of the \ncapital city two weeks ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 150 Christians lost their lives and hundreds more have been \nwounded or displaced in the disaster; the total death toll has \nsurpassed 1,000. This week, bodies swept away by the floods washed up \nas far away as Guinea, 90 miles up the coast from Freetown.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most in the mountainside town of Regent were sleeping when the \nmudslide hit, Power of Praise Ministry was holding an all-night \nprayer vigil. Pastor David S. Dumbuya, his wife, and his children \ndied. One survivor told the Daily Telegraph that he lost 13 of his \nrelatives who attended the event.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody died. It covered the whole church, said Saidu Kanu, World \nHope Internationals country director in Sierra Leone.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther downhill, the floods landed on the western and central parts \nof the capital, where the majority of Freetowns Baptist churches are \nlocated, according to the Baptist World Alliance.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Conteh, a leader with the Baptist Convention of Sierra Leone, \nreported that Bethany Baptist Church lost 60 members, making it one \nof the hardest-hit congregations reported so far.

Few knew that \nthere really was a 10th century Wenceslas, a Christian who ruled for \nabout seven years in Bohemia (which is now part of the Czech \nRepublic). Wenceslas was brought up by his Christian grandmother, \nLudmila. She taught him that faith has to be put into action or it is \na sham. Because of her teaching and example, Wenceslas learned true \nconcern for the poor and suffering. That is the spirit John Mason \nNeale captured when he wrote his carol. The prince goes out on a cold \nnight to feed a poor man who is gathering winter fuel. When a page \ncomplains of the cold and difficulty, Wenceslas urges him to follow \nin his tracks--a mirror of the way we follow in Christ's footsteps.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mark my footsteps, my good page, \u0014\nTread thou in them boldly: \u0014\nThou shalt find the winter's rage \u0014\nFreeze thy blood less coldly.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas was just thirteen when his father died in 921. Ludmila \nacted as regent for the young man, but Wenceslas' mother, Drahomira, \nwanted the throne herself. She killed Ludmila and controlled the \ncountry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas did not wait to come of age, but seized the throne from his \nwicked mother. He banished her to a neighboring country. During his \nshort reign, Wenceslas encouraged German missionaries to preach in \nBohemia. He urged his people to convert to Christianity, even (we \nregret to say) punishing those who held out. At the same time, he \nreformed his country's judicial system and courted peace with \nneighboring nations, especially Germany. He was known for his charity \nto the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas had a younger brother, Boleslaw, who was made in the same \nmold as Drahomira. Some Bohemian nobles resented the fact that \nWenceslas submitted to neighboring Germany. They urged Boleslaw to \ntake action. Boleslaw plotted. When Wenceslas came to mass on this \nday, September 28, 929, his brother followed him to the church door. \nRecognizing that trouble was afoot, Wenceslaus said, \"Brother, you \nwere a good subject to me yesterday.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And now I intend to be a better one!\" shouted Boleslaw and struck \nhis brother in the head with his sword.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas had strength enough to fling his brother to the ground, \nwhereupon one of Boleslaw's men stabbed Wenceslaus in the hand. \nWenceslaus sought refuge in the church but two other assassins struck \nhim down at the door. Bohemians look at Wenceslas as a martyr and \ntheir foremost saint. His picture long appeared on their coins and \nhis crown was a symbol of Czech independence. Although Pope Benedict \nXIV did not want the Bohemian ruler included in the Roman Missal, he \nwas. And an English hymn writer made an immortal carol about him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Good King Wenceslas.\" Deep Cove Crier. \nhttp://www3.telus.net/st_simons/cr9212.htm\u0014\nMershman, Francis. \"St. Wenceslaus.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

    "words": "\u0014\nAs someone who loves history, I have a terrible confession to make: \nGrant is the first Ron Chernow book I've ever read. It will certainly \nnot be the last. Chernow's Grant is meticulously researched, \nwell-written, with an easy style and flow that make a biography feel \nless like a lecture and more like an intimate conversation. He \nprovides descriptions and details that bring the time period and the \npeople to vivid life.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrant was a complex man: both brilliant and naive; overly trusting in \ncivilian life while able to perfectly predict what others would do on \nthe battlefield; a man who claimed to have no great political \nambitions yet was a rare (at the time) two term president. Chernow \nreminds us of the personal connections of the generals of both the \nNorth and South- Grant attended West Point and fought in the Mexican \nWar alongside William T. Sherman, Robert E Lee, and a veritable who's \nwho of later Civil War leaders. The best man at his wedding was James \nLongstreet, who would go on to be a great Southern general in the \nwar. Chernow also brings front and center Grant's hard work for \nAfrican Americans, supporting the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, \nwith equality and voting rights among his lifelong crusades. While \nLincoln is remembered in American history as the President who ended \nslavery, readers of Grant will see that President U.S. Grant should \nbe remembered as a tireless proponent of civil rights and militant \nenemy of the Ku Klux Klan.\u0014\n\u0014\nChernow doesn't turn away from Grant's failures in civilian life: his \npoverty before rejoining the army for the Civil War, his constant \nstruggle with alcoholism, or Grant's repeated mistakes in trusting \nthe wrong people in matters of finance- and occasionally in \ngovernment. Grant's personal traits: pride, stubbornness, loyalty \namong others are shown as what made him the greatest general of his \ntime, but also caused a steep learning curve as President.\u0014\n\u0014\nReaders of Stephen W. Sears' Lincoln's Lieutenants will find this a \nperfect companion to their understanding of the generals of the Civil \nWar, their successes and failures, radically different personalities, \nand their relationships with Lincoln. It continues to amaze me how \nindividual personalities and personal ambitions shape the course of \nmilitary history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFans of history, biographies, and military history will rejoice in \nthis new biography of General Grant- which will stand unchallenged as \nhis definitive biography for a long time. An easy, flowing narrative, \nRon Chernow's Grant will change the average American's view of Grant \nforever.\u0014\n-----------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nGRANT is a miracle of an historical biography. As an aficionado of \nall things Civil War, I thought I'd not be excited by Chernow's \ndiscussion, instead, I learned so much that I had never before read \nAND found myself often holding my breath because Chernow's writing is \nso immediate, it felt like I was experiencing the battles. I had \nphysical reactions to many descriptions of the events in Grant's life \nbecause of the powerful descriptions by Chernow. He made me feel as \nif I were there with Grant and all the other characters. Chernow's \nwriting is exciting because he seems never to use the same word \ntwice, and it's all fresh, revealing and understandable. It's FUN to \nread. It's a text come alive- you can visualize the places, people, \neven visualize and feel the weather- when Chernow writes about about \nmud, I'm sloshing in it, about rivers of blood, decapitations and \ndismembered bodies I had visceral reactions. After reading GRANT, I \ntried to read Grant's autobiography, and couldn't because it was \ndense with minutiae, I gave up.Chernow's GRANT is food for a Nobel \nPrize in Literature. Yes, it's long and heavy to hold, but worth \nevery minute and every page to read.\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nI have read many books on Grant and this one tops them all for many \nreasons. There are things in this book that never made it into \nothers. This book flows like no other. It is hard to describe but \nit's like being born on the same day with someone and growing up with \nthem everyday of your life, 24hours a day, for the rest of your life \nuntil you both die. You get the soul of Grant in this book, you feel \nyourself exactly what he is feeling and what he is going through. \nThis book is not meant to go into details on every aspect of the \nparticular war campaigns, but to express what Grant was going through \nat that point. You also get for the first time and in depth the whole \nfamily backgrounds which certainly explains a whole lot. I would \nsuggest anyone who is new to the Civil War arena maybe read Shelby \nFoote's volumes on the Civil War first before picking up individual \nbiographies. There is so much of the BIG picture (Civil War as a \nwhole) that can't be put into this book, but has bearing on Grant and \nall these Generals. When you know the background of the war, it's \nbattles, personalities and it's Generals, etc, you can easily ignore \nsome of the missing details of the mentioned battles because you \nalready know the particular campaign. What is also nice about this \nbook is that many Grant books are compartmentalized and this one \nisn't. You get the whole enchilada. You find books either on just his \nwar record, one or two on his presidential time, or books \nconcentrating on specific issues on Grant, positive and negative. I \nspent 25 years in the Army in the 82d Airborne Division and in \nSpecial Operations and I wish someone like Grant had been the typical \nGeneral you found in my day, but no way. With the exception of about \nfive in my career, most of them were exactly what you found even back \nthen. Political, toxic or scared for their careers and took the easy \nway out to get that promotion. Grant was an extraordinary General!!\u0014",

    "title": "GOVERMENT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE SIN BUSINESS",
    "words": "Josephine Butler Championed Women\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Six-year-old Eva Butler was excited. Mom and dad were home. She \nrushed to the staircase to greet \u0014\nhr parents--and lost her footing. In front of her mother's horrified \neyes, she fell over the bannister onto the hard tile floor to her \ndeath. Josephine would never erase that haunting sight from her \nmemory. \"It was pitiful to see her, helpless in her father's arms, \nher little drooping head resting on his shoulder and her beautiful \ngolden hair all stained with blood, falling over his arm!\" But rather \nthan retire into a half-mad world of grief and nostalgia, she turned \nher attention outward. \"[I] became possessed with an irresistible \nurge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with \npeople more unhappy than myself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe started to work with the prostitutes of Liverpool. Many had \nbecome street women out of desperation. Josephine was a beautiful \nupper-class woman, well-to-do with many connections. She opened a \nhome to reclaim lost women. As she learned more about their \ncondition, she became increasingly indignant at the unfair laws of a \nsystem that refused women the right to vote. Women should not be \ndenied the vote because they are different than men, she argued. They \nshould be given the vote precisely for that reason, because their \nneeds are different. She became a champion for women. \u0014\n\u0014\nJosephine, who had undergone a strong conversion experience as a \nteenager, needed the strength of faith in her lifelong battle for \nlaws favorable to women. She took on the Contagious Diseases Acts \nthat aimed to stop the spread of venereal disease. Under these laws, \nany woman in designated military towns could be forcibly inspected \nfor venereal disease. The law was completely unfair. Men were not \nexamined. Any woman, however pure, could be denounced to the \nauthorities and forced to get a certificate. Her reputation ruined, \nthe woman might actually be forced into the sex trade. \"This \nlegalization of vice, which is the endorsement of the 'necessity' of \nimpurity for man and the institution of slavery of woman, is the most \nopen denial which modern times have seen of the principle of the \nsacredness of the individual being,\" Josephine declared. She warned \nthat if a woman's rights could be stolen, so could anyone's.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she stood up to speak against outrageous practices, Josephine \nwas slandered. Her enemies heckled and harassed her. They smeared her \nwith dung. A mob smashed the windows of a hotel where she was \nstaying, trying to get at her and threatening to set it on fire. She \nfled through unfamiliar streets and hid behind piles of soap and \ncandles in a shop. Another time, she hid in a hayloft while her \nopponents lit a fire to smoke her out. Her husband's college job was \nthreatened but he encouraged her on. When his wife sheltered fallen \nwomen in their home, he treated them like high society ladies.\u0014\n\u0014\nFar from retreating, Josephine expanded her activities. \"...I felt \nvery weak and lonely,\" she admitted. \"But there was One who stood by \nme.\" She fought similar laws in Europe. In an age that tried to cover \nup sexual problems, she had the courage to address them openly. She \nfought against forced prostitution and appealed to governments not to \nlicense whorehouses. A government should never be in the sin \nbusiness, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile fighting government-sponsored prostitution, she always stood \nbeside the prostitutes. If Christ forgave such women, so should we, \nshe argued. Josephine succeeded in getting some hateful laws repealed \nand helped rouse public sentiment to pass a bill that raised the age \nof consent from thirteen to sixteen. However, she was largely \nforgotten when she died on this day, December 30, 1906.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Josephine. \"Some Thoughts on the Present Aspect of the \nCrusade Against the State Regulation of Vice.\" \nhttp://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/butler/ thoughts.html\u0014\nFisher, Trevor. \"Josephine Butler, Feminism's Neglected Pioneer.\" \nhttp://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m1373/n6_v46/ \n18381679/p1/article.jhtml?term=w.t.stead\u0014\nHay-Cooper, L.

Yes, grass snakes, not rattlesnakes. A \ncouple had a lot of potted plants, and during a recent cold spell, \nthe wife was bringing in a lot of them indoors to protect then from a \npossible freeze. A little green snake was hidden in one of them and \nwhen it was sufficiently warmed up, it came slithering out and went \nunder the sofa. The wife saw it and let out a big scream. The husband \nwas taking a shower but, when he heard his wife scream, ran naked to \nsee what the problem was.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tShe told him there was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the \nfloor to look for it. About that time the family dog came and \ncold-nosed him. He thought the snake had bitten him, so he fainted. \nHis wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tThe attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and \nstarted carrying him out. About that time the snake came out from the \nsofa. The EMS saw it and dropped the stretcher. That's when the man \nbroke his leg and why he is in the hospital. The wife still had the \nproblem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man. \nHe volunteered to capture the snake, so he armed himself with a \nrolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch. Soon he decided \nit was gone. The wife sat down on the sofa in relief, but as her hand \ndangled in between the cushions, she felt the snake. She screamed and \nfainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the neighbor man \ntried to use his long forgotten CPR skills. \u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tThen came the neighbor's wife, who had been at the grocery store, \nsaw her husband's mouth on the woman's and slammed her husband in the \nback of the head with a bag of canned goods, an injury calling for \nhospitalization. The noise woke the woman from her dead faint. She \nsaw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, \nso she assumed he had been bitten by the snake. She went to the \nkitchen, brought back a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it \ndown the man's throat. By now the police had arrived. They saw the \nunconscious man, smelled the whiskey amid listened as the two women \ntried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake. They \ncalled an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing \nwife. That put the woman and the snake right back in worse shape than \nthey were in when the whole thing started. The snake was badly \nnerved, as was the woman.\u0014\n\u0014\n Talk about a bad day!! BE CAREFUL OF SNAKES!\u0014",

    "title": "GUTENBERG'S FIRSTI BIBLE",
    "words": "Gutenberg's 1st Bible?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Gutenberg is one of the most famous men who ever lived, but we \nknow next to nothing about him. Although we can pinpoint the month \nand day of his death, we aren't sure of the year. All the same, if \nyou like to read books, you owe a debt to this extraordinary inventor.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg was the first person in history to actually print books \nfrom movable type. However, the idea may not have been his. A \nsilversmith named Waldvogel taught \"artificial writing\" at Avignon as \nearly as 1444, using steel alphabets and an iron-screw press. \nWaldvogel, however, does not seem to have overcome the obstacles \nwhich Gutenberg shrewdly mastered at great personal cost. This \nincluded developing an oil-based ink.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a goldsmith, Gutenberg had the technical training to accomplish \nthe project, and was able to fund his own early experiments. But \neventually he needed capital and that proved his downfall. He had to \ntake a partner-- Johann Fust of Mainz. Because of his excessive \nsecretiveness, his partner sued him. It is one of the great ironies \nof history that Gutenberg was unable to profit from his invention of \nprinting. His creditors foreclosed on him just when success was \nwithin his grasp. The man who more than anyone else brought about the \nprint revolution, answered in court like any other debtor. Fust was \nawarded most of Gutenberg's equipment and the stock of Latin Bibles \nhe had printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Gutenberg's few surviving Bibles are worth millions of \ndollars. And yet, we don't know for sure when his first Bible was \npublished. Some almanacs say it happened on this day, March 22, 1457. \nHowever, that date has difficulties, because copies already existed \nwhen Fust sued him in 1455.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg's Bible was in Latin, the language of the church. Today we \nare used to elegant and \"clean\" typefaces. He printed his text in the \nthick and elaborate Gothic style familiar to readers of Medieval \nmanuscripts. The Bible was in 3 volumes of 1,282 unnumbered pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he lost his lawsuit, Gutenberg continued to print. However, he \ndreamed of making his books as beautiful as the illuminated \nmanuscripts of the day and it just wasn't feasible at that time. \nPractical printers, who cared less about aesthetics, got more \nbusiness than Gutenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his old age, Gutenberg was very poor. Archbishop Adolf of Nassau \ntook pity on the old man and gave him an appointment at his court \nthat at least fed and clothed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "words": "Gutenberg's 1st Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nJohann Gutenberg is one of the most famous men who ever lived, but we \nknow next to nothing about him. Although we can pinpoint the month \nand day of his death, we aren't sure of the year. All the same, if \nyou like to read books, you owe a debt to this extraordinary inventor.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg was the first person in history to actually print books \nfrom movable type. However, the idea may not have been his. A \nsilversmith named Waldvogel taught \"artificial writing\" at Avignon as \nearly as 1444, using steel alphabets and an iron-screw press. \u0014\n\u0014\nWaldvogel, however, does not seem to have overcome the obstacles \nwhich Gutenberg shrewdly mastered at great personal cost. This \nincluded developing an oil-based ink.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a goldsmith, Gutenberg had the technical training to accomplish \nthe project, and was able to fund his own early experiments. But \neventually he needed capital and that proved his downfall. He had to \ntake a partner-- Johann Fust of Mainz. Because of his excessive \nsecretiveness, his partner sued him. It is one of the great ironies \nof history that Gutenberg was unable to profit from his invention of \nprinting. His creditors foreclosed on him just when success was \nwithin his grasp. The man who more than anyone else brought about the \nprint revolution, answered in court like any other debtor. Fust was \nawarded most of Gutenberg's equipment and the stock of Latin Bibles \nhe had printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Gutenberg's few surviving Bibles are worth millions of \ndollars. And yet, we don't know for sure when his first Bible was \npublished. Some almanacs say it happened on this day, March 22, 1457. \nHowever, that date has difficulties, because copies already existed \nwhen Fust sued him in 1455.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg's Bible was in Latin, the language of the church. Today we \nare used to elegant and \"clean\" typefaces. He printed his text in the \nthick and elaborate Gothic style familiar to readers of Medieval \nmanuscripts. The Bible was in 3 volumes of 1,282 unnumbered pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he lost his lawsuit, Gutenberg continued to print. However, he \ndreamed of making his books as beautiful as the illuminated \nmanuscripts of the day and it just wasn't feasible at that time. \nPractical printers, who cared less about aesthetics, got more \nbusiness than Gutenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his old age, Gutenberg was very poor. Archbishop Adolf of Nassau \ntook pity on the old man and gave him an appointment at his court \nthat at least fed and clothed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "title": "GREAT CHARTER FOR ENGLAND",
    "words": "Great Charter for England\u0014\n \u0014\nIn English history no document has been as much of a foundation to \ncivil rights as the Magna Carta. Archbishop Stephen Langton, a man so \nholy it was said he put all Rome to shame, was the document's main \narchitect. At stake were issues of importance to both church and \nnobles.\u0014\n\u0014\nEngland's barons were on the threshold of revolt against John, their \nhigh-handed King when Stephen Langton brought to their attention an \nold charter granted by Henry I. The archbishop and the nobles \namplified the principles in Henry's charter and presented their Great \nCharter to King John at the field of Runnymead on this date, June 15, \n1215, where he grudgingly sealed it.\u0014\n\u0014\nLangton had every inducement to resist the king. Not only had John \nrefused him his seat at Canterbury, but he had driven Langton's \nfriends and family into exile. When excommunication finally brought \nJohn to heel and Langton to Canterbury, the archbishop had little \nliking for the tyrant.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy throwing his influence behind John's rebel barons, Langton \nincreased their chance of success. Scholars have grumbled that Magna \nCarta placed undue emphasis on concerns of the church and knights. \nThere is something to that complaint. The very first \"chapter\" says, \n\"In the first place [we] have granted to God and by this our present \nCharter have confirmed, for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the \nEnglish church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished \nand liberties unimpaired ... .\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Magna Carta's two most lasting provisions have benefited \nuntold millions of commoners. These are trial by a jury of one's \npeers and a prohibition against new taxes without the permission of \nnational representatives. Implied was the authority of the barons to \ncheck a king, an idea which led to modern parliaments. The monarchy \nwas not absolute.\u0014\n\u0014\nRunnymead was not the end of the story. John, loathe to yield even a \nfraction of his power, appealed to the pope, promising to become his \nvassal. The pope voided Magna Carta. The barons persisted, however, \nand within two years a newer version was approved.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry III accepted and reissued the Magna Carta, making it law. After \nthat, kings on their accession were often made to swear to uphold the \nprovisions of the charter. Existing manuscripts vary in wording. \nArgument exists as to which is the most authoritative.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarry, William. Story of the Nations: Papal Monarchy.

    "title": "GALILEO BEFORE THE INQUISITON",
    "words": "Galileo was frustrated. A web of deceit and hatred had closed around \nhim. As the sixty-nine year old man faced the Inquisition on this \nday, June 22, 1633, he hoped to get at least two changes in the \nstatement his judges insisted he sign. \"Do not make me say I have not \nbeen a good Catholic,\" he pleaded, \"for I have been one and will \nremain one no matter what my enemies say. And I will not say that I \nintended to deceive anyone, especially with the publication of my \nbook. I submitted it in good faith to the church censors and printed \nit only after legally obtaining a license.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judges agreed. They rewrote the words of his \"confession\"--as \nthey should have been. For, as Galileo knew, most of the men who were \nsentencing him held his same opinions--that the earth spun on its \naxis and orbited the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the new injunction before him, Galileo knelt and repeated the \nwords demanded of him. He was strongly \"suspected of heresy.\" He had \n\"held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and \nimmovable and that the Earth is not the center and moves...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then signed another statement. \"I, the said Galileo Galilei, \nhave abjured [renounced], sworn, promised and bound myself as above; \nand in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand \nsubscribed the present document of my abjuration and recited it word \nfor word at Rome, in the convent of the Minerva, this twenty-second \nday of June, 1633.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of the most famous trials in history. The church often \ntakes all the blame for the fiasco of justice that took place that \nday in Rome. It had the unfortunate effect of branding the Roman \nCatholic Church as anti-science, when in fact famous Catholics of the \nMiddle Ages (Grosseteste, Bradwardine, Oresme and others) had done \nmuch to advance and promote science. Galileo himself was a staunch \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt the church was in the wrong. A commission formed by \nPope John Paul II in the 1980s admitted as much. But was it fully \nresponsible? There were, in fact, two other parties at fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne was Galileo himself. His vanity, sarcastic words, contempt for \nlesser minds and half-truths had earned him fierce enemies among the \nintellectuals of Europe--especially among the Jesuits. Galileo even \nfudged at least one experiment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second set of culprits were naturalists (the scientists of the \nday). Advocates of the pagan philsopher Aristotle resisted Galileo's \nfindings. The pope and cardinals would not have acted if dozens of \nthese \"scientists\" had not said Galileo was wrong. Some hated \nGalileo, who had hurt their feelings. Others felt that Aristotle and \nthe Bible should not be overturned without solid evidence. It did not \nmatter that both Kepler and Galileo had shown that the Bible could be \ninterpreted to agree with the new science. Their own eyes showed them \nthat the sun, not the earth moves. Galileo could not provide hard \nevidence to the contrary. Solid proof for the earth's movement around \nthe sun was two hundred years away, when tiny shifts in star \npositions and subtle pendulum motions were finally measured.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillispie, Charles Coulston.

    "words": "Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897, a crippled child with a club \nfoot. He was an unusally bright child that gerw up despised, \nridiculed and jeered by his healthy friends. He was a withdrawn \nestranged child, hating and despising everybody, finding himself in \nthe world of books. He was intelligent, bright, well read but feeling \nrejected and developed a strong need to succeed, to gain acceptance, \nand recognition that would place him above the masses. At one time, \nhe considered becoming a priest but was rejected because the \ninterviewing priest didn't think he believed strongly enough in God. \nHe did not believe in Nazism but espoused the creed.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoebbels did not believe in all the lies he spread so successfully.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of his quotes:\u0014\n\u0014\nConscience is nothing more than a crutch for cowards.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no need to argue with the masses, slogans are much more \neffective. Slogans are like strong drinks to people.The crowd doesn't \nreason like men but like women who rely on their feelings rather than \non their intelligence. Propaganda is a gret, difficult and noble art, \ntherefore it calls for a genuius.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fuhrer attaches great iportance to a powerful anti-Semitic \npropaganda. He, too, regards success as depending upon constant \nrepetition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPity, to say nothing of sympathy, is entirely inappropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery German soldier's death in this war is the Jew's responsibility. \nThey have it on their conscience, hence they must pay for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews are to blame for this war. The treatment we give them does \nthem no wrong. They have more than deserved it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it, and you \nwill even come to believe it yourself.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes \nthe truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For \nintellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield \nto the stronger, and this will always be \"the man in the street.\" \nArguments must therefore be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to \nemotions and instincts, not the intellect. Truth was unimportant and \nentirely subordinate to tactics and psychology.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success \nunless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly - it \nmust confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the absolute right of the State to supervise the formation of \npublic opinion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and a \npsychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is \nin fact a circle. They are mere words, and words can be molded until \nthey clothe ideas and disguise.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe shall go down in history as the greatest statesmen of all time,or \nas the greatest criminals\u0014\n\u0014\nOur starting point is not the individual:\u0014\nWe do not subscribe to the view that one should feed the hungry, give \ndrink to the thirsty, or clothe the naked  Our objectives are \ndifferent: We must have a healthy people in order to prevail in the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does Christianity mean today? National Socialism is a religion. \nAll we lack is a religious genius capable of uprooting outmoded \nreligious practices and putting new ones in their place. We lack \ntraditions and ritual. One day soon National Socialism will be the \nreligion of all Germans. My Party is my church, and I believe I serve \nthe Lord best if I do his will, and liberate my oppressed people from \nthe fetters of slavery. That is my gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou cant change the masses. They will always be the same: dumb, \ngluttonous and forgetful.\u0014",

    "title": "GETTING TO KNOW THE NONES",
    "words": "The Nonesthe religiously unaffiliatedrepresent a compromise between \nbeing an atheist or agnostic, and holding on to pure faith and \ntraditional organized religion. The Nones are independent in their \nthinking, spiritual but not dogmatic, and they challenge organized \nreligion on such issues as abortion, euthanasia, separation of church \nand state, womens right to join the priesthood, sciences place in \nsociety, evolution, and climate change, to name a few.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nones exist in greater numbers in the West and Asia, but are \nhardly present or visible in the mysterious Orient. In fact, they are \na mystery to many, and there are abundant myths about them all over \nthe world. To dispel some of the myths, here are the main five myths \nsurrounding the Nones:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. The Nones Are Anti-Religion\u0014\n\u0014\nNot really! Study after study shows convincingly that the Nones are \nspiritually alive and religiously curious. The Pew Research Centers \nForum on Religion and Public Life in the U.S. found that of the \nunaffiliated:\u0014\n\u0014\n68 percent say they believe in God.\u0014\n37 percent classify themselves as spiritual but not religious.\u0014\n33 percent say religion has importance in their lives.\u0014\n21 percent pray every day.\u0014\nHowever, 63 percent of the unaffiliated say that religion is losing \nits influence on American life, and 67 percent say churches/religious \norganizations are too involved with politics. It is obvious that the \nabuses of religion by the various religious establishments in the \nU.S., Canada, Europe, and all over the globe are driving the Nones \naway from religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Canada, for instance, Professor Tom Sherwood from Carleton \nUniversity and author of Listening to the Echo, found that the Nones \ncomprise a number of subpopulations:\u0014\n\u0014\nreligious people who will not self-identify as such\u0014\nSBNRs (Spiritual but Not Religious)\u0014\natheists\u0014\nagnostics\u0014\nhumanists\u0014\npeople who practice the rituals of more than one religion\u0014\nseekers who are intentionally rejecting their own religious \ntraditions and have not arrived at another\u0014\npeople who have no religious formation or spiritual development, and \nare not thinking about it.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, the Nones are the modern-day explorers in the spiritual \nrealm. They are rejecting religious orthodoxy, abuse of power, \ncorrupt religious authority, privileges, and, above all, religions \ninterference in the political arena. For instance, we find the \nentanglement of the Evangelical churches in the U.S. and various \nreligious organizations in the political field all too visible. Also \nwe find the Russian Orthodox Church has been playing a leading role \nas the cheerleader for Russian Vladimir Putins regime. In the Middle \nEast, for example, the mixture of politics and religion is complete, \npresent, and inseparable. These are the type of scenarios and \nexamples that drive the Nones away from organized religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Many Nones Are Highly Educated and Have High Incomes\u0014\n\u0014\nVarious research tells a different story. The demographic profile \nfrom the Pew Research Center confirms that there are hardly any major \ndifferences between the religious constituency and the spiritual but \nnot religious, like the Nones, when it comes to income and education, \nalthough most of the Nones are holders of a university degree and are \nslightly more educated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe growth of the Nones, says the Pew Research Center, has taken \nplace across a wide variety of demographic groups. The percentage of \nunaffiliated respondents has increased among men and women, college \ngraduates and those without a college degree, people earning $75,000 \nor more and those making less than $30,000 annually, and residents of \nall major regions of the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus money is not the criterion here; rather it is conviction, \nindependent thinking, and being free to choose and break away from \ntraditional values. The individual is sovereign at last, thanks to \nthe Nones phenomenon.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. The Nones Are Like Another Religion\u0014\n\u0014\nNot at all! The classic definition of religion does not accord with \nor resemble much of the Nones characteristics. They possess little, \nif any, of the known attributes that organized religion holds. The \nbest definition of religion that I found is for author Yuval Harari \nin his book Sapiens. He defines religion in the following way:\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion is any system of human norms and values that is founded on \na belief in superhuman laws. Religion tells us that we must obey \ncertain laws that were not invented by humans, and that humans cannot \nchange at will. Some religions, such as Islam, Christianity, and \nHinduism, believe that these super-human laws were created by the \ngods. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Communism, and Nazism, \nbelieve that these super-human laws are natural laws. Thus Buddhists \nbelieve in the natural laws of karma, Nazis argued that their \nideology reflected the laws of natural selection, and Communists \nbelieve that they follow the natural laws of economics. No matter \nwhether they believe in divine laws or in natural laws, all religions \nhave exactly the same function: to give legitimacy to human norms and \nvalues, and to give stability to human institutions such as states \nand corporations. Without some kind of religion, it is simply \nimpossible to maintain social order.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nones have no ideology as such. They are not religious fanatics \nor extreme atheists. Only a small portion, about 13 percent, call \nthemselves atheists. However, they do, more than the majority of the \ngeneral public, believe in evolution, science, rationality, and \nfact-based inquiry. They distrust organized religion, but they are \nnot replacing it with another of their own. Christopher Hitchens put \nit best when he wrote: Our belief is not a belief. Our principles \nare not a faith. We do not rely solely upon science and reason, \nbecause these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we \ndistrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may \ndiffer on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, \nopen-mindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nones are nothing, truth be told, but a yearning to emancipate \nthe human spirit from the yoke of conformity, fear of the unknown, \nand obedience to established rules and habits of thinking, behaving, \nand acting in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nHostages to history the Nones are not. Hostages to religious \ndictation they are not. Hostages to blind faith and to the tribe they \nare not!\u0014\n\u0014\n4. The Nones Are Anarchists and Nihilists\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing is further from the truth. The vast majority of studies and \nstatistical analysis indicate that the Nones are in their majority \nspiritual, moral, and socially responsible citizens. They just dont \nfollow orders from established religions, and are \nindependent-thinking people.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, they are soft rebels having issues with organized \nreligions obsession with power, money, politics, tax-free status, \nunfair treatment of women, and earthly decadence. They are the \ninvisible reformers, the quiet type at the back of the bus. Anarchy \nis not their motto or practice. Nihilism is an alien concept to them; \nit is not their raison dtre. They are what they are: thinking \noutside the box, and real thinking in one of mans most difficult \ntasks. To be a free-minded person is the first prerequisite for \nliving well, and living well is the best revenge!\u0014\n\u0014\n5. The Nones Believe in Nothingness\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fundamental belief of the Nones, if we can discern one at all, is \nthe following: Where totalitarian political structures or tyrannical \nregimes believe and behave as if the citizens are their properties, \nthe Nones are telling organized religion, and all religions in \ngeneral, that they are not the property of any establishment. That is \nthe revolutionary dimension of the rising Nones all over the world \nexcept in the burning lands of the Middle East and many parts of \nAfrica.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear reader, ask yourself this question: What is worth more in this \nworld than the capacity to own yourself, your dignity, your thoughts, \nyour mind, your independence, and the ability to question, debate, \nand doubt? Organized religions thrive on control. Control they aim \nat, and mostly achieve, from cradle to grave. The unaffiliated \nbelieve that being a master of your own being is the ultimate \nliberation of soul, thought, and body. That is not a belief in \nnothingness!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Should We Respect the Nones?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe individual has always had to struggle to keep from being \noverwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, \nand sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the \nprivilege of owning yourself.Friedrich Nietzsche.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should pay attention to the Nones for the following reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\nThey live secure in the knowledge that they are not sheep following \norders. Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said it best: \nJust as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking \nare complementary components of a broader concept of individual \nfreedom of mind, so also the individuals freedom to choose his own \ncreed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the \ncreed established by the majority.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are good in advancing the intellectual capital of the human \nrace. They do what Christopher Hitchens once wrote: Take the risk of \nthinking for yourself, much more happiness, truth, beauty, and wisdom \nwill come to you that way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey live in harmony with our times of change, especially when it \ncomes to womans place in society and within organized religions \narchaic and obdurate structures. Lisa Miller wrote the following in \nthe Washington Post on March 8, 2012: In churches (and synagogues \nand mosques) across the land, women are still treated as second-class \ncitizens. And because women of faith are increasingly breadwinners, \nsingle moms and heads of households, that diminished status is \nbeginning to rankle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey prove the saying that the only people who see the whole picture \nare the ones who step outside the frame.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey advance the conversation regarding the role of religion in the \npublic square. They play an effective role in enacting further and \nconsolidating the wall of separation between church and state.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey pressure and lobby for reforms in religious institutions. Change \nis the law of time. Change is the essence of living and living well. \nTo adapt to new discovery, new ideas, new scientific findings and \nways of looking at the universe. From the changing attitudes toward \nwomen, gender issues, race, diversity, homosexuality, science, \nevolution, to the interpretation of religious texts in light of \nmodernity and new discoveries in all fields of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey open new horizons for the young who are wrestling with classical \nquestions about authority, conformity, and organized religion and \ntheir place in the world. A new dawn of freedom is now a possibility \nwithout offending tradition or social peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey practice what Martin Luther King, Jr., said: The day we see the \ntruth and cease to speak is the day we begin to die.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise of the Nones is real, present, and apparently here to stay \nand grow. Nothing is as constant as change. Fear not the rise of the \nNones!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle Author: ?Elie Mikhael Nasrallah\u0014\n\u0014\nElie Mikhael Nasrallah, born in Lebanon, graduated from Carleton \nUniversity in Ottawa, with an honours degree in political science.

    "title": "GENESIS AND MOSAIC AUTHORSHIP",
    "words": "Genesis and the Pentateuch\u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis does not stand by itself in the Bible. Since pre-Christian \ncenturies it has been considered as the first book of the Pentateuch. \nThe Jews considered it an integral part of the Torah (Law) rather \nthan a separate book, and regarded it as the beginning of the Torah \nof Moses. The reference to Mosaic authorship in the Talmud (Baba \nBathra, folio 14b) is well known. This ancient opinion is worth a \ncareful analysis. Obviously the Jews did not believe that Moses wrote \nall of the Pentateuch, for Joshua is given credit for the account of \nthe death of Moses in the last eight verses of Deuteronomy. The \nspecial reference to the section of Balaam surely reflects \narguments among the rabbis that perhaps Moses was not the author of \nthat material, thus requiring a special affirmation by the \nauthorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name of Moses does not occur in the book of Genesis except in the \nlater titles of English versions. There are no specific references to \nhis authorship in either the Old Testament or the New Testament. It \nis apparent, however, that when the Bible speaks of the law of \nMoses (cf. Mal. 4:4; Dan. 9:13; Luke 2:22; Acts 15:5), it is \nreferring to all of the Pentateuch, including Genesis, since the Jews \nof the time saw this section as a unit. Yet this is not a clear \nstatement of authorship, but of relationship. The rest of the \nPentateuch treats the actual period when Moses lived, whereas Genesis \nrelates the story of redemption down to a time several centuries \nbefore his day.\u0014\n\u0014\nNumerous passages indicate the viewpoint of a writer later than Moses \n(cf. 12:6, the Canaanite was then in the land; 13:8, the mention of \nHebron, which does not appear to assume that name until the time of \nJoshua, as in Josh. 14:15; 15:13; Gen. 22:14, it is said to this \nday; 36:31, there was yet no king over Israel; 40:15, the land of \nthe Hebrews). Moses relation to Genesis must have been more as \ncompiler than as author, and the redaction process must have \ncontinued after his day, with material arranged and added. It is the \nsolid opinion of the biblical writers that Moses is the principal \nfigure in the Torah. Thus any view seeking to be consistent with \ntheirs will search for the hand of Moses in Genesis as well as \nelsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nClyde Francisco\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, C. J. (2017).

    "words": "\u0014\n\"The world cannot return to where it was before the virus. The status \nquo ante is untenable.\" (Angela Merkel)\u0014\n\u0014\nHere we go again. The eternal question of evil in the world springs \nup one more time. Why? Why does God, the almighty, all-powerful, \nall-knowing, allow evil, pandemics, plagues, wars, and viruses of all \nkinds to afflict His creatures on this earth?\u0014\n\u0014\nTrying to answer this question fully is an impossible task. I shall \nnot try. However, I will say this: for many the pandemic is natures \nGod, or Darwins God, at work.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than ever, we see that evil exists wherever humans live. It \npreceded Home sapiens. The problem of the existence of evil has \ntroubled humanity in all times and places. The viruses, the plagues, \nthe famines, are all companions on our march through time and space.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe confront evil by transcendental outreach to challenge existing \nreality and even create an alternative one. Angels, demons, spirits, \nwizards, gods, and witches have peppered folk religions since mankind \nfirst started telling stories, wrote Robin Marantz Henig in theNew \nYork Times on March 4, 2007. Charles Darwin noted this in The \nDescent of Man. A belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies, he \nwrote, seems to be universal. According to anthropologists, \nreligions that share certain supernatural featuresbelief in a \nnoncorporeal God or gods, belief in the afterlife, belief in the \nability of prayer or ritual to change the course of human eventsare \nfound in virtually every culture on earth.1\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pandemic of 2020 offers a sobering lesson on the limits and \nutility of belief in supernatural entities when reality is so stark, \nhaunting, perplexing, bewildering and above all deadly. Unlike the \nplagues of the Middle Ages in Europe when millions perished and \npandemics lasted for decades, present viruses and pandemics have so \nfar been shorter, because of medical and scientific advances. \nOtherwise, millions more would have died, given the population \nexplosion for the past hundred years or so.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut humans are restless and rational and irrational beings all at \nonce. We detest and complain about evil and death, and we turn to our \ngods for help and salvation at the same time. The human is a knot of \ncontradictions and opposing drives: reason and unreason; wisdom and \nrecklessness; faithlessness and mysticism; logic and imagination. We \nfeed on exact science as much as we do on myths, on fictions and \nfabulations. We can die for others or let them perish in the cold; we \ncan create extraordinary things only to enjoy their utter \ndestruction; human society can be paradise and hell at one and the \nsame time.2\u0014\n\u0014\nThese contradictions are also present all around us: in belief in \nGod, in cultural heritage, language acquisition, survival tools and \nmany other variables. The bottom line, according to byproduct \ntheorists, is that children are born with a tendency to believe in \nomniscience, invisible minds, immaterial soulsand then they grow up \nin cultures that fill their minds, hard-wired for belief, with \nspecifics. It is a little like language acquisitions, Paul Bloom \nsays, with the essential difference that language is a biological \nadaptation and religion, in his view, is not. We are born with an \ninnate facility for language but the specific language we learn \ndepends on the environment in which we are raised. In much the same \nway, he says, we are born with an innate tendency for belief, but the \nspecifics of what we grow up believingwhether there is one God or \nmany, whether the soul goes to heaven or occupies another animal \nafter deathare culturally shaped.3\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pandemic in America\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brooks of theNew York Times called the pandemic of 2020 as the \nfirst invasion of America. It invaded the physical space as well as \nthe spiritual and moral spheres. Brooks wrote on May 21, 2020, the \nfollowing: That whole version of the American creed was all based on \nan assumption of existential security. Americans had the luxury of \nthinking and living the way they did because they had two whopping \ngreat oceans on either side. The United States was immune to foreign \ninvasion, the corruptions of the old world. It was often spared the \nplagues that swept over so many other parts of the globe.4 Not \nanymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo nation is an island anymore. Globalization, immigration, \nmigration, and technology are invading every corner of this globe. \nNow America finds itself tied to the world as never before. There is \nno American exceptionalism when it comes to pandemics or modern-day \nplagues. This integrated international order is above and beyond any \nnation-state or empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nation-state alone does not have a future, said Angela Merkel, \nthe German chancellor, in May of 2020. The German chancellorwho \nwill not seek re-election next year, and who will be missedsignaled \nthat innovation is needed. The world cannot return to where it was \nbefore the virus. The status quo ante is untenable. The nationalism \nof Trumps America, Xis China, and Vladimir Putins Russia is not \nthe answer.5\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica alone is not America. American nationalism in the era of a \npandemic is neither possible nor desirable in the way that it once \nfunctioned. America in the modern world and in the midst of a complex \nepidemiological catastrophe should be leading the world, not \nretreating, since it can neither escape it nor can it escape history \nor the future. Individualism in the private sphere is like \nisolationism in the world of nation-state politics: desirable in \npeaceful and prosperous times, but deadly in a pandemic environment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe security of Americans depends, in these trying times of the \nCOVID-19 era, also on the security of other countries and the \ninterdependence of nations in trade, economics, public health, \ninternational financial affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican contradictions are truly remarkable. The USA has the worlds \ntop universities in academic, scientific, technological, and social \nsciences research in most fields. Yet there is a sizable portion of \nthe population that is opposed to science, climate change, cell \nresearch, pandemic medical instructions, vaccines, and many other \nissues.\u0014\n\u0014\nA belief in God and science should not be incompatible. They can \ncohabit to advance the human condition especially in pandemic times. \nThe coronavirus pandemic is not a religious matter but a scientific \nproblem that needs medical and social cooperation. It is a community \neffort in which the neighborhood is the entity of common survival and \nperseverance, and individualism and disdain for authority are not \nhelpful but dangerous when a virus is a social killer. For social \ndistancing is not offensive to religious sensibilities. It is, in \nfact, designed for the protection of both: the believer and the \ngeneral public at large.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving been born in Lebanon, of all places, I know a thing or two \nabout hardship, agony, isolation during the war, and savage lonely \ndays of mayhem and melancholy. But the coronavirus pandemic has been \na different animal altogether. Wearing a maskhas become mandatory, \nfor a simple cough directed toward your face can amount to a sickness \nsentence if that person happens to be infected. Wars and plagues are \nalike; they both kill with indifference. They are cold-blooded and \nknow no shame, boundaries, or nationality. They kill, above all, old \nhabits and regular daily routines. They rob you of the familiar, of \nthe joy of just being yourself. In his masterpiece novel De Niros \nGame, Lebanese author Rawi Hage wrote: Ten thousand bombs had landed \non Beirut, that crowded city, and I was lying on a blue sofa covered \nwith white sheets to protect it from dust and dirty feet.6 Two or \nthree months of social distancing in 2020 have reminded me of the \nwar-torn Lebanon in the 1970s when war and viruses were \nindistinguishable.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on this topic in the New York Times, Roger Cohen made this \nobservation: Having witnessed the unimaginable, having been on this \njourney into an unfamiliar world of silence and stillness and death, \nhaving been obliged to change unquestioned habits, will humanity \nsimply return to its former ways if that proves possible?7\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica, however, is not Lebanon or like any other nation. It has a \nunique history and geography and cultural narrative. But the pandemic \nhas been shipping away at these American value system and assumptions \nlike never before. Something has changed since February of 2020. But \nsomething more profound is going on. We are undergoing a more \npermanent shift in national consciousness, a reconstruction of \nmeanings, symbols, values, and narratives. If the old American creed \ngrew up in an atmosphere of assumed security and liberty, the new one \nis growing up in an atmosphere of vulnerability and precariousness.8\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica is undergoing profound changes caused by a pandemic that came \nlike an invisible hurricane. Race relations are now at the center of \nAmerican life yet again. Immigration is also a national problem, or a \ngift, to be dealt with. Yet America will be America again, marching \non and making it to the finishing line as it did so many times \nbefore. In fact, the phenomenon of Trump is a symptom and not a cause \nof the many ailments of American society.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn God we trust. In nature we believe. And in science we will find \nour solutions to ancient and modern problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1Robin Marantz Henig, Darwins God, New York Times, March 4, 2007.\u0014\n\u0014\n2Costica Bradatan, Our Delight in Destruction, New York Times, \nMarch 27, 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\n3Henig.\u0014\n\u0014\n4David Brooks, The First Invasion of America, New York Times, May \n21, 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\n5Roger Cohen, Germanys Lessons for China and America, New York \nTimes, May 22, 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\n6Rawi Hage, De Niros Game (Hanover, N.H.: Steerforth Press, 2007).\u0014\n\u0014\n7Roger Cohen, No Return to the Old Dispensation,  New York Times, \nMay 8, 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\n8Brooks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle Author: ?Elie Mikhael Nasrallah\u0014\n\u0014\nElie Mikhael Nasrallah, born in Lebanon, graduated from Carleton \nUniversity in Ottawa, with an honours degree in political science.

    "words": "There are several people groups described as giants in the Bible or \namong whom giants lived in the Old Testament:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tThere are the Anakim, who are descendants from the Nephilim \nmentioned in Genesis 6:14 (compare Num 13:33), and whom the people \nof Israel encountered under Moses, and later under Joshua (Num \n13:2233; Josh 15:1314).\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tAt one time, before the children of Israel traveled through the \nTransjordan, the land to the east of the Jordan River was heavily \npopulated with tall people known as Emim (Deut 2:1011) and the \nZamzummim, also called the Zuzim (Deut 2:20).\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tThe Amorites, another group that stood in the way of Israel \nclaiming the Promised Land, are described as being exceptionally tall \n(Amos 2:910).\u0014\n\u0014\n4.\tLastly, there were the Rephaim, which are mentioned nearly 20 \ntimes, most often in association with the conquest of the promised \nland, when Moses encountered King Og of Bashan, whose bed measured to \n13 feet in length (Deut 2:11, 2022; 3:1113; Josh 12:4; 13:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nGoliath was Rephaim. He and the four giant warriors listed alongside \nhim are descended from rapha (???) in Gath (2 Sam 21:22; 1 Chr 20:8). \nIf rapha is interpreted as a proper name, Rapha, then the four \nwarriors were all brothers of Goliath. The biblical text does not \nactually say this. Only one of these men, Lahmi, is specifically said \nto be the brother of Goliath. Therefore, it is best to translate the \nterm as giants or Rephaim as many English translations do.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Rephaim giants in the Bible survived the wars of Moses \nand Joshua, and their descendants settled in the Philistine city of \nGath. The other warriors who accompanied Goliath may not have been \nbrothers, but they were all part of an enduring and unusual lineage \nthat challenged Israel for their land and opposed their God.\u0014",

    "title": "GOD OR MAN? ASKS NICEA COUNCIL",
    "words": "God or Man? Asks Nicea Council\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred and twelve bishops gathered. In the center of the room, \non a throne, lay the four gospels. The emperor himself, dressed in a \npurple gown and wearing a silver diadem, opened the council. It was \nhe who had called them together. \"I rejoice to see you here, yet I \nshould be more pleased to see unity and affection among you.\" The \nplace was Nicea. It was on May 20, 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few days would be devoted primarily to one purpose: finding \na way to describe exactly who Jesus was. Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his controversial doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine, \nthe emperor, was alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more, some international, some regional. Those councils which \ncame after also grappled with issues of Christ's humanity and deity. \nWas he one person or two? Was he God while in his mother's womb? Did \nhe have just one will? Which books belong in the Bible? The seventh \necumenical church council was also held at Nicea.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "GALILEO BEFORE THE INQUISITION",
    "words": "Galileo before the Inquisition\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo was frustrated. A web of deceit and hatred had closed around \nhim. As the sixty-nine year old man faced the Inquisition on this \nday, June 22, 1633, he hoped to get at least two changes in the \nstatement his judges insisted he sign. \"Do not make me say I have not \nbeen a good Catholic,\" he pleaded, \"for I have been one and will \nremain one no matter what my enemies say. And I will not say that I \nintended to deceive anyone, especially with the publication of my \nbook. I submitted it in good faith to the church censors and printed \nit only after legally obtaining a license.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judges agreed. They rewrote the words of his \"confession\"--as \nthey should have been. For, as Galileo knew, most of the men who were \nsentencing him held his same opinions--that the earth spun on its \naxis and orbited the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the new injunction before him, Galileo knelt and repeated the \nwords demanded of him. He was strongly \"suspected of heresy.\" He had \n\"held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and \nimmovable and that the Earth is not the center and moves...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then signed another statement. \"I, the said Galileo Galilei, \nhave abjured [renounced], sworn, promised and bound myself as above; \nand in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand \nsubscribed the present document of my abjuration and recited it word \nfor word at Rome, in the convent of the Minerva, this twenty-second \nday of June, 1633.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of the most famous trials in history. The church often \ntakes all the blame for the fiasco of justice that took place that \nday in Rome. It had the unfortunate effect of branding the Roman \nCatholic Church as anti-science, when in fact famous Catholics of the \nMiddle Ages (Grosseteste, Bradwardine, Oresme and others) had done \nmuch to advance and promote science. Galileo himself was a staunch \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt the church was in the wrong. A commission formed by \nPope John Paul II in the 1980s admitted as much. But was it fully \nresponsible? There were, in fact, two other parties at fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne was Galileo himself. His vanity, sarcastic words, contempt for \nlesser minds and half-truths had earned him fierce enemies among the \nintellectuals of Europe--especially among the Jesuits. Galileo even \nfudged at least one experiment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second set of culprits were naturalists (the scientists of the \nday). Advocates of the pagan philsopher Aristotle resisted Galileo's \nfindings. The pope and cardinals would not have acted if dozens of \nthese \"scientists\" had not said Galileo was wrong. Some hated \nGalileo, who had hurt their feelings. Others felt that Aristotle and \nthe Bible should not be overturned without solid evidence. It did not \nmatter that both Kepler and Galileo had shown that the Bible could be \ninterpreted to agree with the new science. Their own eyes showed them \nthat the sun, not the earth moves. Galileo could not provide hard \nevidence to the contrary. Solid proof for the earth's movement around \nthe sun was two hundred years away, when tiny shifts in star \npositions and subtle pendulum motions were finally measured.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillispie, Charles Coulston.

Along with Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz, he \nwas a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren in Zrich, and thereby one of \nthe founders of Anabaptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Blaurock was born in 1491 in Bonaduz in Graubnden, \nSwitzerland. He was educated at the University of Leipzig and served \nas a priest of the Roman Catholic Church until his conversion to \nevangelical Anabaptism. Blaurock had evidently departed from the \nCatholic Church before he arrived in Zrich circa 1524, for he had \nalready taken a wife. Though he came to see Huldrych Zwingli, he soon \nbecame attached to the more radical followers of Zwingli. These \nradicals insisted on following only that which had Biblical support. \nThey rejected the mass, images, and infant baptism. The city council \ncondemned their position, ordered them to desist from their meetings, \nand ordered all unbaptized babies to be baptized within eight days. \nOn January 21, 1525, the despondent group held a secret meeting at \nthe home of Felix Manz. These believers went to their knees in prayer \nfor guidance. Arising from the prayer, George Blaurock asked Conrad \nGrebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith in Christ. Grebel \ndid so, and afterwards Blaurock proceeded to baptize the others who \nwere present.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Blaurock worked closely with Felix Manz until Manz was \nmartyred in Zrich on January 5, 1527. On that same day, Blaurock was \nseverely beaten and permanently expelled from Zrich. He kept moving, \nlaboring at Bern, Biel, the Grisons, and Appenzell. After his arrest \nand fourth banishment in April 1527, Blaurock left Switzerland never \nto return.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom here he turned to the Tyrol. In 1529 he became the pastor of the \nchurch in Adige Valley, after their former pastor, Michael Krschner, \nwas burned at the stake. Blaurock conducted a very successful \nministry in Tyrol. Many believers were baptized and churches founded. \nThe example of discipleship in full communities of goods that began \namong the churches that Blaurock started continues to be a source of \ninspiration to intentional communities such as the Hutterites and the \nBruderhof.[2][3] In August he and Hans Langegger were arrested by \nInnsbruck authorities. While in captivity they were tortured for \ninformation. On September 6, 1529, Blaurock and Langegger were burned \nat the stake near Klausen.\u0014",

Eventually, starving and thirsty, he made his way \ninto Pennsylvania where Quakers sheltered him and taught him to read. \nHe took the name Pennington in honor of a notable Quaker leader, and \nmastered his studies so well that in the 1830s he was allowed to \naudit classes at Yale. He became an educator and preacher in New York \nand published the first-known history of blacks in America in 1841.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a famous sermon, Covenants Involving Moral Wrong are Not \nObligatory upon Man (1842), Pennington argued that the moral law, \nderived from God, trumps human law if the human law commands people \nto do evil. Freedom is an unalienable right, given by God. Americans \nwho enforced laws holding others in slavery were transgressing the \nmoral law. And those who restored escaped slaves to masters were \nviolating Isaiah 16:3-4 which commands Gods people to hide outcasts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1849 Penningtons autobiography, The Fugitive Blacksmith, was \npublished in London. It gave the harrowing details of his escape and \nhis rise to become a Christian minister.

The University \nof Heidelberg awarded him an honorary degree.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in New York, he was one of a group of black Americans who \nlitigated against racial segregation on street cars and won on appeal \nin the State Supreme Court in 1855. A supporter of abolition, he \nministered to Congregations in the south after the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegretably Pennington became an alcoholic. This addiction hastened \nhis death, which came on this day, 22 October 1870, in Jacksonville, \nFlorida.

    "words": "CONFIDENT IN GOD, GAUDET ACHIEVED REMARKABLE GAINS FOR THE DOWNTRODDEN\u0014\n \u0014\nOn this day, 23 December 1900, Frances Joseph arrived home in \nLouisiana after several months absence. As a delegate to the \ninternational convention of the Womens Christian Temperance Union, \nheld in Edinburgh, Scotland, she had mortgaged her home to pay trip \nexpenses, and left New Orleans and her children on 4 June. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer hatred of alcohol sprang from the family-destroying addiction of \nher first husband whom she divorced after ten years of marriage. Her \nefforts at prison reform in New Orleans had magnified her \nunderstanding of the problem. An African-American Christian with \nNative-American blood, she responded with determination in 1894 when \nthe Lord prompted her through her conscience to visit prisoners, \nstart prison prayer groups, and work for the release and reform of \njuveniles. She saw that many prisoners had committed crimes to obtain \ndrink or while under the influence of alcohol.  \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Jim Crow laws, she succeeded in winning the respect of many \nwhite authorities and leading women and subsequently influencing \nlocal policies. Her faith, revealed in letters and reports, gained \nher an international reputation. Hence her invitation to the WCTU \nconvention. In Scotland she received numerous invitations to speak in \nchurches and her talks often resulted in spiritual conversions among \nher listeners.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpportunities to visit England, Ireland, and France brought her more \ninvitations to speak. She told audiences of her experiences and of \nher dream to open a juvenile home. Back in the United States, she \nattended the WCTUs national convention in New York, where she also \nspoke, before finally heading home to New Orleans and her waiting \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer faith was rewarded with funding that allowed her to begin \nattending court and taking in juvenile boys. When her own home became \ntoo crowded, she bought a 105-acre farm on which she would build \nseveral dormitories. The Colored Normal and Industrial School she \nfounded was renamed the Gaudet Normal and Industrial School of Black \nYouth in 1902. More than an orphanage and boarding school, it trained \nyoung people to succeed. Eventually she developed a competitive \nsystem in which the boys bid for garden plots on which to raise \nvegetables. When they sold the produce, they paid their lot rent and \nkept all remaining profits. Some even hired girls from the female \ndorm to clean and iron their clothes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1905, she married A. P. Gaudet, who had assisted her as secretary \nfrom the start of the boarding school venture. Thus when she \npublished her autobiography in 1913, it was under the name by which \nshe is now known, Frances Joseph-Gaudet.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in 1919, she began relinquishing the work to the Protestant \nEpiscopal Church. She continued as principal until 1921 when she \nresigned. She spent the final years of her life in Chicago, where she \ndied 30 December 1934. In 2006 the Episcopal church added her name to \nits calendar of feasts.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n---------------\u0014",

Let us \ntest our faith in the fire. This fire will harm my soul as little as \nthe fiery furnace harmed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\u0014\n\u0014\nExecutioners in Tyrol (a region of Austria) had doused him with \nbrandy and set him alight as a warning to anyone who dared to adopt \nAnabaptist teaching. From the governments perspective, the action \nwas justified. A Peasants war (15241525), inspired in part by \ncommon people acquiring ideas from newly-accessible Scriptures, \nalarmed European powers. Then when a group calling themselves \nAnabaptist seized Mnster, Germany (15341535), the revolt was \nsuppressed after a lengthy siege, and thereafter anyone who held \nAnabaptist views, however peaceful, became a target of state terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt did not matter to rulers that the majority of Anabaptists were \nquiet and hardworking. Their principle tenet, that only individuals \nwho had reached the age of understanding and believed the gospel \nshould be baptized, was commonly held in the early church and is \naccepted world-wide by many Christians today. However, in the \nReformation era the idea was met with fury by Catholics and \nProtestants alike. For centuries the church had baptized infants. \nThose believers who insisted on adult immersion had themselves been \nbaptized as infants. Therefore, their opponents named them \nAnabaptists, meaning re-baptizers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnabaptists such as Hutter also taught that oath-taking and fighting \nin wars were wrong. They preached that anyone who did not reform his \nor her behavior was no true Christian, leading to accusations they \nwere legalists. Hutters group also believed Christians should hold \nall their goods in common. (Sharing was essential because so many of \nthe groups providers had been imprisoned or killed.) As these ideas \nwere antithetical to most theologians and rulers, persecution poured \nupon Anabaptists from every side. \u0014\n\u0014\nHutter, a hat maker in the Tyrol, had converted to Anabaptist \nteaching sometime between 1525 and 1529. He quickly proved to be a \npowerful evangelist, winning hundreds of new adherents despite the \npersecution they knew they would face. And he had a knack for \norganizing and managing the suffering victims. When the situation in \nthe Tyrol became impossible in 1529, he arranged for hundreds of his \nfollowers to escape to Moravia which had more tolerance for religious \ndifferences; and he moved there himself in 1533. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll too soon, persecution followed the Anabaptists to Moravia. Driven \nout in 1535, the inoffensive Christians had nowhere to go and found \nthemselves hiding in forests or caves, or huddling together on the \nopen heath. Hutter said plaintively, We cannot be prohibited from \nthe earth, for the earth is the heavenly Fathers; may He do with us \nwhat He will.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote Emperor Ferdinands Vice-Regent a letter of warning that God \nwould avenge the hounding and murdering of innocent people. The Most \nHigh will lift his hand against you, now and eternally. This we \nannounce to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . and \nshortly you will see that we have told you nothing but the truth of \nGod. . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nHutter ventured back to Tyrol where he was captured, along with his \npregnant wife. Tortured for weeks, whipped, and immersed in freezing \nwater (to mock baptismal practices) Hutter died in fire, but his wife \nescaped. Recaptured a couple years later in Italy, she too was put to \ndeath. Hans Amon, the man Jakob had left in charge of the Moravian \ncongregation, said that Jakob gave a great sermon through his death, \nfor God was with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Gutenberg's 1st Bible?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Gutenberg is one of the most famous men who ever lived, but we \nknow next to nothing about him. Although we can pinpoint the month \nand day of his death, we aren't sure of the year. All the same, if \nyou like to read books, you owe a debt to this extraordinary inventor.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg was the first person in history to actually print books \nfrom movable type. However, the idea may not have been his. A \nsilversmith named Waldvogel taught \"artificial writing\" at Avignon as \nearly as 1444, using steel alphabets and an iron-screw press. \nWaldvogel, however, does not seem to have overcome the obstacles \nwhich Gutenberg shrewdly mastered at great personal cost. This \nincluded developing an oil-based ink.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a goldsmith, Gutenberg had the technical training to accomplish \nthe project, and was able to fund his own early experiments. But \neventually he needed capital and that proved his downfall. He had to \ntake a partner-- Johann Fust of Mainz. Because of his excessive \nsecretiveness, his partner sued him. It is one of the great ironies \nof history that Gutenberg was unable to profit from his invention of \nprinting. His creditors foreclosed on him just when success was \nwithin his grasp. The man who more than anyone else brought about the \nprint revolution, answered in court like any other debtor. Fust was \nawarded most of Gutenberg's equipment and the stock of Latin Bibles \nhe had printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Gutenberg's few surviving Bibles are worth millions of \ndollars. And yet, we don't know for sure when his first Bible was \npublished. Some almanacs say it happened on this day, March 22, 1457. \nHowever, that date has difficulties, because copies already existed \nwhen Fust sued him in 1455.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg's Bible was in Latin, the language of the church. Today we \nare used to elegant and \"clean\" typefaces. He printed his text in the \nthick and elaborate Gothic style familiar to readers of Medieval \nmanuscripts. The Bible was in 3 volumes of 1,282 unnumbered pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he lost his lawsuit, Gutenberg continued to print. However, he \ndreamed of making his books as beautiful as the illuminated \nmanuscripts of the day and it just wasn't feasible at that time. \nPractical printers, who cared less about aesthetics, got more \nbusiness than Gutenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his old age, Gutenberg was very poor. Archbishop Adolf of Nassau \ntook pity on the old man and gave him an appointment at his court \nthat at least fed and clothed him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "words": "The Growing Religious Fervor in the American Right: This Is a Jesus \nMovement\u0014\nRituals of Christian worship have become embedded in conservative \nrallies, as praise music and prayer blend with political anger over \nvaccines and the 2020 election.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Elizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham have covered religion in America for \nmore than a decade. They reported this article from Phoenix, Dallas \nand Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey opened with an invocation, summoning Gods hedge of thorns and \nfire to protect each person in the dark Phoenix parking lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey called for testimonies, passing the microphone to anyone with \ninspirational words that theyd like to say on behalf of our J-6 \npolitical prisoners, referring to people arrested in connection with \nthe Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, whom they were honoring a \nyear later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, holding candles dripping wax, the few dozen who were gathered \nlifted their voices, a cappella, in a song treasured by millions of \nbelievers who sing it on Sundays and know its words by heart:\u0014\n\u0014\nWay maker, miracle worker, promise keeper\u0014\nLight in the darkness, my God\u0014\nThat is who you are \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not a church service. It was worship for a new kind of \ncongregation: a right-wing political movement powered by divine \npurpose, whose adherents find spiritual sustenance in political \naction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian right has been intertwined with American conservatism \nfor decades, culminating in the Trump era. And elements of Christian \nculture have long been present at political rallies. But worship, a \nsacred act showing devotion to God expressed through movement, song \nor prayer, was largely reserved for church. Now, many believers are \nimporting their worship of God, with all its intensity, emotion and \nambitions, to their political life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt events across the United States, it is not unusual for \nparticipants to describe encountering the divine and feel they are \ndoing their part to install Gods kingdom on earth. For them, \nright-wing political activity itself is becoming a holy act.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese Christians are joining secular members of the right wing, \nincluding media-savvy opportunists and those touting disinformation. \nThey represent a wide array of discontent, from opposing vaccine \nmandates to promoting election conspiracy theories. For many, \npandemic restrictions that temporarily closed houses of worship \naccelerated their distrust of government and made churchgoing \npolitical.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a Trump rally in Michigan last weekend, a local evangelist offered \na prayer that stated, Father in heaven, we firmly believe that \nDonald Trump is the current and true president of the United States. \nHe prayed in Jesus name that precinct delegates at the upcoming \nMichigan Republican Party convention would support Trump-endorsed \ncandidates, whose names he listed to the crowd. In Jesus name, the \ncrowd cheered back.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe infusion of explicitly religious fervor  much of it rooted in \nthe charismatic tradition, which emphasizes the power of the Holy \nSpirit  into the right-wing movement is changing the atmosphere of \nevents and rallies, many of which feature Christian symbols and \nrituals, especially praise music.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith spiritual mission driving political ideals, the stakes of any \nconflict, whether over masks or school curriculums, can feel that \nmuch larger, and compromise can be even more difficult to achieve. \nPolitical ambitions come to be about defending God, pointing to a \ndesire to build a nation that actively promotes a particular set of \nChristian beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is refreshing for me is, this isnt at all related to church, \nbut we are talking about God, said Patty Castillo Porter, who \nattended the Phoenix event. She is an accountant and officer with a \nlocal Republican committee to represent the voice of the \nGrassroots/America First posse, and said she loved meeting so many \nChristians at the rallies she attends to protest election results, \nborder policy or Covid mandates.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow God is relevant, she said. You name it, God is there, because \npeople know you cant trust your politicians, you cant trust your \nsheriffs, you cant trust law enforcement. The only one you can trust \nis God right now.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe parking-lot vigil was sponsored by a right-wing voter \nmobilization effort focused on dismantling election policy. Not \neveryone there knew the words to Way Maker, the contemporary \nChristian megahit. A few men, armed with guns and accompanied by a \nGerman shepherd, stood at the edge of the gathering, smoking and \ntalking about what they were seeing on Infowars, a website that \ntraffics in conspiracy theories. Others, many of whom attended \ncharismatic or evangelical churches, sang along. \u0014\n\u0014\nWorship elements embedded into these events are recognizably \nevangelical. There is prayer and proclamation, shared rituals and \nstories. Perhaps the most powerful element is music. The anthems of \nthe contemporary evangelical church, many of which were written in \njust the last few years, are blending with rising political anger, \nbecoming the soundtrack to a new fight.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious music, prayer and symbols have been part of protest \nsettings throughout American history, for diverging causes, including \nthe civil rights movement. Music is personal, able to move listeners \nin ways sermons or speeches cannot. Singing unites people in body and \nmind, and creates a sense of being part of a story, a song, greater \nthan yourself.\u0014\n\u0014\nADVERTISEMENT\u0014",

    "title": "GOD IS NOT OMNISCIENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT",
    "words": "The truth, however, is that despite theological claims about divine \nomniscience, and assumptions by most believers, the God of the Hebrew \nBible is not omniscient, although he certainly has a great deal of \nknowledge about most things that count. There is, apparently, a \nself-imposed limitation when it comes to the inner workings of the \nhuman soul. To determine finally what makes human beings decide \nultimate questions and offer ultimate commitments requires scrutiny \nand testing. Several examples in the Bible demonstrate this need for \ntesting. The greatest exegetes have attempted to show that the story \nin Genesis 22 of Abrahams near sacrifice of Isaac does not imply any \nlimitation in Gods Knowledge of Abrahams fidelity. Yet, the story \nclearly says otherwise: The purpose of the test when God calls on \nAbraham to sacrifice his son Isaac (as it is explicitly stated in \nGenesis 22:1) is so that God can determine whether Abraham is Willing \nto obey the divine command to surrender his only son, whom he loved, \nto Gods demand for such a sacrifice. The implication is clearly that \nGod imposed the test in order to find out something he did not know \nbefore. Moreover, in Genesis 22:1112, after Abraham passes the test, \nGod says, Now I know \u0014\n\u0014\nThe same limitation on Gods knowledge is reflected in Deuteronomy \n8:23, where God explains that he kept the Israelites in the \nwilderness for 40 years to test them (among other things), to find \nout what was in their hearts, whether they would prove faithful or \nfalse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same is true in the test of Job. The test is imposed so that God \nas well as the Satan can find out whose contention about Job is \ncorrect. Is he faithful to God for Gods sake or for his own? The \nessential determination cannot be made without testing. God might \nhave created human beings differently, so that they could be known \nand understood without testing, but it was essential to his purpose \nthat human beings be responsible for their decisions and actions, and \nbe answerable for what they decide and what they do. They must be \nfree of divine control and foreknowledge. Although it is highly \ndebated in both Judaism and Christianity, the evidence in the Hebrew \nBible points to a mystery at the center of the human person, a \nmystery that even God respects, so that the ultimate truth of human \ncommitment can only be decided by time and testing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt may seem a curious paradox, but within the story of Job, God \ncannot proceed with the test in fact he knows the answer conclusively \nbeforehand. He can have the same or opposite confidence that Satan \nhasthat is what makes for a challenge and a legitimate wager. But he \nmust be able to be proved wrong. If he proceeds with the test, that \nproves that he doesnt know in advance.\u0014\nThe argument propounded by Jobs three friendsthey are in essential \nagreement on the a main pointsis that it is sacrilegious to even \nhint at, much less utter that God is not just in his dealings with \nthe world and with humanity. From that premise, the friends argue \nback to the palpable inference about Jobs suffering: Since it is \naxiomatic that God is the source of bane as well as blessing, and \nsince God is by elemental definition just in his dealings, it follows \nthat Job has done something, or said something, or thought something \ncontrary to the law of God. And, according to his friends, he only \nmakes things worse by stubbornly insisting on his righteousness. \nThere is a solution to the dilemma, they say, and that is to repent \nIf Job will concede that the root of the trouble lies in his stubborn \nunwillingness to confess his faults, and make amends and truly \nrepent, then the friends are confident that the present agonies will \ncease and Job will be restored to divine favor, with all the \nappropriate restitutions and recompenses.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs It Possible to Understand the Book of Job?\u0014\n\u0014\nA sensitive new reading of one of the most puzzling and powerful \nbooks in the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nBy David Noel Freedman\u0014\n(2004).

    "words": "Galileo before the Inquisition\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010,  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo was frustrated. A web of deceit and hatred had closed around \nhim. As the sixty-nine year old man faced the Inquisition on this \nday, June 22, 1633, he hoped to get at least two changes in the \nstatement his judges insisted he sign. \"Do not make me say I have not \nbeen a good Catholic,\" he pleaded, \"for I have been one and will \nremain one no matter what my enemies say. And I will not say that I \nintended to deceive anyone, especially with the publication of my \nbook. I submitted it in good faith to the church censors and printed \nit only after legally obtaining a license.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judges agreed. They rewrote the words of his \"confession\"--as \nthey should have been. For, as Galileo knew, most of the men who were \nsentencing him held his same opinions--that the earth spun on its \naxis and orbited the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the new injunction before him, Galileo knelt and repeated the \nwords demanded of him. He was strongly \"suspected of heresy.\" He had \n\"held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and \nimmovable and that the Earth is not the center and moves...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then signed another statement. \"I, the said Galileo Galilei, \nhave abjured [renounced], sworn, promised and bound myself as above; \nand in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand \nsubscribed the present document of my abjuration and recited it word \nfor word at Rome, in the convent of the Minerva, this twenty-second \nday of June, 1633.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of the most famous trials in history. The church often \ntakes all the blame for the fiasco of justice that took place that \nday in Rome. It had the unfortunate effect of branding the Roman \nCatholic Church as anti-science, when in fact famous Catholics of the \nMiddle Ages (Grosseteste, Bradwardine, Oresme and others) had done \nmuch to advance and promote science. Galileo himself was a staunch \nCatholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt the church was in the wrong. A commission formed by \nPope John Paul II in the 1980s admitted as much. But was it fully \nresponsible? There were, in fact, two other parties at fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne was Galileo himself. His vanity, sarcastic words, contempt for \nlesser minds and half-truths had earned him fierce enemies among the \nintellectuals of Europe--especially among the Jesuits. Galileo even \nfudged at least one experiment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second set of culprits were naturalists (the scientists of the \nday). Advocates of the pagan philsopher Aristotle resisted Galileo's \nfindings. The pope and cardinals would not have acted if dozens of \nthese \"scientists\" had not said Galileo was wrong. Some hated \nGalileo, who had hurt their feelings. Others felt that Aristotle and \nthe Bible should not be overturned without solid evidence. It did not \nmatter that both Kepler and Galileo had shown that the Bible could be \ninterpreted to agree with the new science. Their own eyes showed them \nthat the sun, not the earth moves. Galileo could not provide hard \nevidence to the contrary. Solid proof for the earth's movement around \nthe sun was two hundred years away, when tiny shifts in star \npositions and subtle pendulum motions were finally measured.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillispie, Charles Coulston.

I have heard the \ngrumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me. 28 \nSay to them, As I live, declares the Lord, what you have said in my \nhearing I will do to you: 29 your dead bodies shall fall in this \nwilderness, and of all your number, listed in the census from twenty \nyears old and upward, who have grumbled against me, 30 not one shall \ncome into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except \nCaleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun. 31 But your \nlittle ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and \nthey shall know the land that you have rejected. 32 But as for you, \nyour dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. 33 And your children \nshall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years and shall suffer for \nyour faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the \nwilderness. 34 According to the number of the days in which you spied \nout the land, forty days, a year for each day, you shall bear your \niniquity forty years, and you shall know my displeasure. 35 I, the \nLord, have spoken. Surely this will I do to all this wicked \ncongregation who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness \nthey shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.\u0014\n\u0014\n36 And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and \nmade all the congregation grumble against him by bringing up a bad \nreport about the land 37 the men who brought up a bad report of the \nlanddied by plague before the Lord. 38 Of those men who went to spy \nout the land, only Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of \nJephunneh remained alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nNumbers 14:34\u0014\n\u0014\nNumbers 14:37\u0014\n\u0014\n[And ye shall know my breach of promise.] This is certainly a most \nharsh expression; and most learned men agree that the words et \ntnuwaatiy  should be translated \"my vengeance\", which is the \nrendering of the Septuagint Vulgate, Coptic, and Anglo-Saxon, and \nwhich is followed by almost all our ancient English translations. The \nmeaning however appears to be this: As God had promised to bring them \ninto the good land, provided they kept his statutes, ordinances, \netc., and they had now broken their engagements, he was no longer \nheld by his covenant; and therefore, by excluding them from the \npromised land, he showed them at once his annulling of the covenant \nwhich they had broken, and his vengeance because they had broken it. \u0014\n(from Adam Clarke's Commentary\u0014\n\u0014\nNumbers 14:37\u0014\n\u0014\n[Those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died] \nThus ten of the twelve that searched out the land were struck dead, \nby the justice of God, on the spot!

    "words": "\u0014\nGod Wills it! Pope Urban Preached the First Crusade\u0014\n \u0014\nWITHIN EIGHTY YEARS of the death of Mohammed in 632, Muslims had \nconquered most of the formerly Christian territories of the Middle \nEast, North Africa, and Asia. They controlled Spain and were \nadvancing elsewhere. In those early years, Muslims generally allowed \nChristians and Jews to observe their religious traditions. However, \nmembers of non-Muslim faiths had to pay higher taxes and held lower \nstatus. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks emerged. Tartars from \ncentral Asia, they had recently converted to Islam. Their attitude \ntoward other faiths was less tolerant. They conquered much of \nChristian Asia Minor and extended their rule into the Middle East. \nPressed hard by their onslaught, Alexius Comemnus, the Byzantine \nEmperor, wrote a letter to Pope Urban II pleading for help. \u0014\n\u0014\nUrban summoned a Council to meet at Clermont, France. There he \npromoted the concept of a Truce of God which would restrain \nviolence in Europe and he called for a crusade against the Islamic \noppressors. On this day, 27 November 1095, a great crowd of laymen \nand clergy gathered in an open field to hear the Pope speak. \u0014\n\u0014\nUrban described the wretched plight of the Middle East under its new \nrulers according to his information. He said that churches had been \nconverted to mosques and stables and that Jerusalem was trampled by \nheathen feet. The persecution and torture of Christians was rampant \nand Christian women were raped with impunity. Because of constant \nattacks, pilgrims could not travel in safety. To whom therefore has \nthe labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering the territory \nfallen, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has \nconferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, \nand strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you. \nUrban promised remission of sins to anyone who would join an \nexpedition to free the Holy Land. He reminded his listeners that the \nchurch of the West owed its origin to the church of the East. \nAdvance boldly, as knights of Christ, and rush as quickly as you can \nto the defense of the Eastern Church, he urged. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs with a single voice the crowd responded, God wills it! God wills \nit! Urban agreed. God had shown it was indeed his will by uniting \ntheir hearts in a single cry, he said, and that cry must become their \nbattle slogan. He commanded them to sew the sign of the cross on \ntheir garments. Following the end of the council, Urban confirmed by \nletter his promise of remission of sins.\u0014\n\u0014\nArmies of ill-trained peasants set off, most to die a long way from \nJerusalem. Some butchered Jews along their path of march. But \ntraveling behind these peasant hordes came a group of professional \nsoldiers who had outfitted themselves at great personal expense. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn their long march toward Jerusalem they overcame obstacle after \nobstacle and internal quarrels. Finally they wrested Jerusalem from \nIslamic control on 15 July 1099, butchering so many people that (one \nof their letters claimed) the blood flowed to the horses knees by \nSolomons Portico.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "GENOCIDE FLOWED FROM FEAR AND ETHNIC HATRED IN \nRWANDA\u0014\n \u0014\nALTHOUGH THE TUTSIS AND HUTUS in Rwanda spoke the same language, \nshared the same culture, and could not always be identified by \ndifferences in appearance, ethnic tensions were strong between them \nin the twentieth century. These were aggravated by land shortages and \npast rivalries, by earlier colonial discriminationand by faulty \nchurch policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe minority Tutsi had ruled the country when European missions first \narrived, and the missions sided with them. When the Hutu came to \npower (partly through the efforts of individual Catholic priests), \nthe top hierarchy of the mainline churches realigned with the Hutu. \nDiscrimination against Tutsi became strong within Catholic, \nPresbyterian, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist churches. (By \ncontrast, the fast-growing Pentecostal movement rejected any power \nalignment and its members were less prone to join in racial \nrivalries.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe majority Hutu in Rwanda massacred groups of Tutsis several times \nin the decades following Independence from colonialism. Tutsi exiles \nformed an army in nearby Uganda and attacked Rwanda several times, \naggravating tensions. In neighboring Burundi, where Tutsis held the \nupper hand, they massacred 200,000 Hutus in 1972. In the 1980s and \n1990s, the Hutu government of Rwanda, under fire for corruption, \nstaged acts of violence that it blamed on Tutsis. According to \ninternational agencies, it also fomented violence and chaos that it \nthen claimed was the result of multi-party efforts to reform the \ngovernment. In this way it exploited and ramped up ethnic tension in \na desperate gamble to retain power.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Rwandas mainline churches often spoke out against violence, \nthey did so in general terms without identifying specific culprits. \nThey urged support for the Hutu government. Many churchgoers took \nthis as assent for Hutus to target Tutsis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone shot down the airplane of Rwandan President Juvenal \nHabyarimana on this day, 6 April 1994. As if on cue, Hutu radicals \nrounded up and killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Kigali, the \nnational capital. Over the next few days, Habyarimanas successors \nsent operatives across the country in a pre-planned and coordinated \neffort to exterminate Tutsis. Government radio broadcasts incited \nkilling. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made the resulting genocide more horrifying was that killers and \nkilled had worshiped together. In fact, many Hutu priests not only \negged in the murders, but identified Tutsi parishioners and manned \nbarricades to capture any who tried to escape. At Ngoma parish, Hutus \nwent to the church each morning to pray before heading out to \nparticipate in the days slaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe governments method was to encourage Tutsi to gather for \nsanctuary in churches and schools (where in previous massacres Tutsi \nhad been granted asylum) and then to slaughter them en masse. Ten or \ntwenty thousand Tutsi might be killed at a single church. So many \nwere killed in the church at Nyamata that survivors later converted \nit into a memorial for the murdered.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver a period of three months, about 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered, \noften with great cruelty. Tutsi survivors who had hidden in swamps \nspoke of drinking muddy water enriched with the blood of the dead. \nThey told of Hutus hacking open pregnant women to kill their babies \nbefore their eyes. Attackers hacked off Tutsis limbs, rather than \nkill them outright, laughing and singing all the while; then left the \nwounded to die in agony over the course of two or three days. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere and there Hutu individuals, especially among Pentecostal \nChristians, actively aided Tutsis. In the few parishes where \nChristian leaders actively opposed the violence, a smaller proportion \nof Tutsi died. Some Hutus even chose to die with Tutsis they were \nprotecting. Timothy Longman, in Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, \ntells of Flicitas Niyitegeka, a sixty-year-old nun, who rejected \noffers to spare her life, choosing to die with the people she was \ntrying to protect. She was shot last.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe genocide did not cease until commander Paul Kagames Tutsi army \ninvaded Rwanda from neighboring Uganda where it had been training. \nKagame drove out the killers, toppled the Hutu regime, and \nestablished a new government with Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, as \npresident. However, Kagame soon jailed Bizimungu on accusations of \ninstigating ethnic killing. Over a million Hutus fled to the Congo \nwhere international opinion tended to take their side. Violence \ncontinued because Rwanda warred against the Hutu refugees, many of \nwhom had been involved in the massacres and were armed and militant.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the restoration of peace in Rwanda, Tutsis and Hutus worship \ntogether again, but not without suspicion. As one survivor remarked, \nI know that all the Hutus who killed so calmly cannot be sincere \nwhen they beg for pardon, even of the Lord. For them the Tutsi will \nalways be the enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "GOD'S FIRST WORST ENEMY",
    "words": "Gods first worst enemy\u0014\nBefore Satan, there was the biblical sea monster Leviathan.\u0014\nby Esther J. Hamori  October 2023 Christian Century\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the reputation Satan has gained over the last two millennia, you \nmight think he was Gods original nemesis. But long before there was \na Christian devil, God had a first worst enemy: the great mythical \nsea monster, best known by the name Leviathan.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cosmic showdown of god versus sea monster has roots deep beneath \nthe biblical texts. Among the colorful variety of ancient Southwest \nAsian traditions of gods battling sea monsters is even a Canaanite \nmyth in which the god Baal kills the monstrous sea serpent Litan, \nwhose name and description are echoed in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the time when the Bible mentions the sea monster, its \ngetting its head bashed in. For instance, Psalm 74 offers a dramatic \ndescription of Gods defeat of the monster. Before that resolution, \nthings arent looking too good for Gods people. The psalm describes \nhow enemies have violated the sanctuary, taken axes to it, and set it \non fire. The poet has one hope, that God will conquer Israels \nenemies like he vanquished his own:\u0014\n\u0014\nYou split the sea with your strength; you shattered the heads of sea \nmonsters upon the water. You smashed down the heads of Leviathan; you \ngave him as food to the people, to the desert creatures. (Ps. \n74:1314, all translations mine)\u0014\nThis monster is so forbidding that the mere memory of Gods ancient \nvictory over it is meant to reassure people looking at their \nhacked-up, burned-down sacred space.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts hard not to come off as forbidding when you have a lot of heads. \nGod smashes the headsyes, pluralof Leviathan. God is cracking \nskulls, and its not enough just to crush the multiple heads, so God \nalso desecrates the sea monsters corpse. God feeds its carcass to \nthe people dwelling in the desertapparently picking up the corpse \nand chucking it a few miles inlandwith leftovers for the wild \nanimals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn oracle in Isaiah also calls up the memory of Gods ancient victory \nover the sea monster. Isaiah uses another name for the monster, Rahab \n(no relation to the biblical woman, whose name looks the same in \nEnglish but is different in Hebrew):\u0014\nAwake, awake, put on strength, Arm of the Lord! Awake, as in the days \nof old, generations of long ago! Was it not you who hacked Rahab to \npieces, who pierced the sea monster? (Isa. 51:9)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Psalm 74 has God in unarmed combat with the sea monster, \ncrushing its many rearing heads, here God is armed. God chops up the \nsea monster, piercing it with some divine weapon we can only imagine.\u0014\nIn both of these scenes, Gods vanquishing of the sea monster is \nsecurely in the distant past. But the best monsters never stay dead, \nand Leviathan is Gods forever foe. Fought and slain in days already \nancient to the biblical writers, the sea monster promises to \nresurface for another round, destined to be slain again. Gods \nconclusive victory is still to come. In another part of Isaiah, the \nprophet declares:\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that day, God with his fierce and huge and strong sword will \npunish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, \nand he will kill the sea monster that is in the sea. (Isa. 27:1)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe irony of the forever fight is that through an assurance that God \nwill slay the monster in a final showdown, the monster grows even \nlarger. It wont be killed only onceits like a recurring nightmare. \nGod will always have to battle this monster. This primordial creature \nis the Hebrew Bibles poster child for the dangerous looming enemy \nthat must be defeated, so much so that Egypt and other regional \nenemies are sometimes referred to metaphorically as sea monsters.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts no wonder, then, that in the New Testament the sea monster \ndevelops from the great enemy into the Enemy. And the evolution is \nspectacular. The sea monster becomes a giant red dragon with seven \nheads, the ancient serpent who is called the devil and Satan, the \ndeceiver of the whole world (Rev. 12:3, 9; 20:2). Where the Hebrew \nBible refers to the sea monster, or even to Leviathan by name, the \nSeptuagint (the Greek version used by New Testament writers) uses the \nword dragon. The descriptions in Revelation of the devil as a giant \nancient dragon and serpent are lifted from Isaiah, where \nLeviathan is both serpent and sea monsteror, in the Septuagint, \nserpent and dragon (Isa. 27:1). The sea monster has become the \nvery picture of the devil. You know youre bad to the bone when you \nmake a good template for the Prince of Darkness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlaying, smashing, crushing, piercing. From the first clash to the \nfinal epic battle, everything would lead us to expect consistent \nanimosity between God and this enemy. But Gods proclivities are \nnever quite what we expect. As it turns out, God also delights in his \nsea monster.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Psalm 104, Leviathan is praised as a thing of wonder. The psalm \nmarvels at creation: God stretched out the heavens like a tent, set \nthe earth on its foundations, covered it with the ancient deep like a \ngarment, and made the streams flow. There are branches for birds and \ngrass for cattle. God made moon and sun, darkness and light; wild \nanimals prowl at night, and people work all day until the evening \ncomes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf this sounds familiar, its because the first 23 verses of the \npsalm name almost every facet of creation from Genesis 1. But in \nGenesis, the pinnacle of creation is humankind. The poet of Psalm 104 \ntakes a very different view of the culmination of Gods creation:\u0014\nLord, how many are your works! In wisdom you have made them all; the \nearth is full of your creatures. There is the sea, great and wide; \ncreeping things without number are there, living creatures small and \ngreat. There ships go, and Leviathan, whom you formed in order to \nplay with him. (Ps. 104:2426)\u0014\n\u0014\nHere the pinnacle of creation is Leviathan. In Genesis, God finishes \nwith humankind, having finally created something in his image (Gen. \n1:2627). In this psalm, God finishes with Leviathanhaving finally \ncreated his companion. And theres more: hes Gods pet! In one \nTalmudic reading of this verse, God plays with Leviathan for three \nhours a day.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full ariticle, see My Dcuments/God's First Worst Enemy\u0014",

    "words": "God Behind Barbed Wire\u0014\nHow a Nazi-soldier-turned-theologian found hope.\u0014\nBY PHILIP YANCEY|       2005\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a recent visit to Virginia I met one of my heroes: Jrgen \nMoltmann. I have plowed through almost a dozen of his books, and to \nmy surprise, the German theologian in person exuded a charm and sense \nof humor that belie his scholarly works.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoltmann was planning on a career in quantum physics until he was \ndrafted at age 18 at the height of the Second World War. Assigned to \nanti-aircraft batteries in Hamburg, he saw compatriots incinerated in \nthe fire-bombings there. The question \"Why did I survive?\" haunted \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter surrendering to the British, the young soldier spent the next \nthree years in prison camps in Belgium, Scotland, and England. When \nHitler's empire imploded, exposing the moral rot at the center of the \nThird Reich, Moltmann saw how other German prisoners \"collapsed \ninwardly, how they gave up all hope, sickening for the lack of it, \nsome of them dying.\" As he learned the truth about the Nazis, \nMoltmann felt an inconsolable grief about life, \"weighed down by the \nsomber burden of a guilt which could never be paid off.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMoltmann had no Christian background. He had brought two books with \nhim into battleGoethe's poems and the works of Nietzscheneither of \nwhich nourished much hope. But an American chaplain gave him an \nArmy-issue New Testament and Psalms, signed by President Roosevelt. \n\"If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there,\" the prisoner read. \nCould God be present in that dark place? As he read on, Moltmann \nfound words that perfectly captured his feelings of desolation. He \nbecame convinced that God \"was present even behind the barbed \nwireno, most of all behind the barbed wire.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMoltmann also found something new in the Psalms: hope. Walking the \nperimeter of the barbed wire at night for exercise, he would circle a \nsmall hill in the center of the camp on which stood a hut that served \nas a chapel. That hut became for him a symbol of God's presence in \nthe midst of suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater Moltmann was transferred to Norton Camp, an educational camp in \nEngland run by the YMCA. The local population welcomed the German \nprisoners, bringing them homemade food, teaching them Christian \ndoctrine, and never adding to the burden of guilt the prisoners felt \nover Nazi atrocities. (Hearing Moltmann's fond recollection of those \ndays\"they treated me better than the German army\"I could not help \ndrawing the contrast to Guantnamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, where we are \nsowing seeds of hatred that will bear sour fruit for generations.)\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon release, Moltmann began to articulate his theology of hope. We \nexist in a state of contradiction between the Cross and the \nResurrection. Surrounded by decay, we nonetheless hope for \nrestoration, a hope illuminated by the \"foreglow\" of Christ's \nresurrection. Faith in that glorious future can transform the \npresentjust as Moltmann's own hope of eventual release from prison \ncamp transformed his daily experience there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough all of Moltmann's dense theological works run two themes: \nGod's presence with us in our suffering and God's promise of a \nperfected future. If Jesus had lived in Europe during the Third \nReich, Moltmann noted, he likely would have been branded like other \nJews and shipped to the gas chambers. In Jesus, we have definitive \nproof that God suffers with us, as Moltmann explains in The Crucified \nGod. (During the war in El Salvador, someone sent Moltmann a picture \nof one of six Jesuits murdered by a death squad, and next to the body \nin a pool of blood lay the Spanish edition, El Dios Crucificado.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, Jesus gives a foretaste of a future time when earth \nwill be restored to God's original design. Easter is the beginning of \nthe \"laughter of the redeemed  God's protest against death.\" A \nperson without faith may assume from the suffering on this planet \nthat God is neither all-good nor all-powerful. Faith allows us to \nbelieve that God is not satisfied with this world either, and intends \nto make all things new.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly at Christ's Second Coming will the kingdom of God take shape in \nall its fullness. In the meantime, we establish settlements of that \nkingdom, always glancing back to the Gospels for a template. Moltmann \nnotes that the phrase \"Day of the Lord\" in the Old Testament inspired \nfear, but in the New Testament it inspires hope, because those \nauthors have come to know and trust the Lord whose Day it is.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a single sentence Jrgen Moltmann expresses the great span from \nGood Friday to Easter. It is, in fact, a summary of human history, \npast, present, and future: \"God weeps with us so that we may someday \nlaugh with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Thirty-seven states operate a \nlottery, and some form of gambling is legal in 48 states. \nAdvertisements for online gambling sites appear all over the \ninternet. There are 280 Web sites that offer online gambling for real \nmoney. Online betters gamble at the rate of about 10 billion dollars \na year and it is growing fast.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Problem gambling's impact on families and youth is only beginning to \nbe understood. For example, adult problem gamblers are more likely to \ndivorce, have destabilized families, drink excessively and use drugs, \nabuse their wives and children, suffer depression, and attempt \nsuicide. The children of problem gamblers are more likely to do \npoorly in school; use illicit drugs, tobacco, and alcohol; run away; \nattempt suicide; indicate they are unhappy; and take up gambling than \nchildren from non-gambling families. Three out of four children of \nproblem gamblers report that their first gambling experience occurred \nbefore age 11. This is the first generation of American children to \nhave grown up in a society where gambling has been widely legalized, \naccepted, marketed, and glamorized.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As gambling proliferates, it increases the exposure of children to \ngambling and their vulnerability to the addiction. Increasingly, the \nmarket-savvy gambling industry is pushing the concept of \"Family \nEntertainment Centers,\" which include places for adults to gamble \nwhile their children engage in other entertainment. The aim of the \ngambling industry is to create the next generation of gamblers from \nthe children who watch their parents get excited by gambling. \nResearchers at Harvard Medical School reviewed nine studies of 7,700 \nyoung people, ages 15-20, in the United States and Canada. They found \nthat 9.9 to 14.2 percent displayed problems in gambling and 4.4 to \n7.4 percent met the diagnostic criteria for \"pathological gambling\" \ndisorder. These figures are two to three times greater than those \nreported among adults.\" (Sightings comes from the Martin Marty Center \nat the University of Chicago Divinity School.)\u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014",

The mistreatment was reportedly not \norchestrated for interrogation but for the guards' entertainment. \nPhotographing the abuse was integral to the abuse itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian leaders* and others* have noted the pornographic nature of \nthe images, and the role pornography has played\"' in training \nAmericans for precisely this behavior. When kids raised on porn \n\"become MPs in a prison in Iraq, they don't pull out the fingernails \nor set off loud radios to harass prisoners,\" said Prison Fellowship's \nCharles Colson.'' 'Instead they strip them and make them pose in \npretend sex actsjust like pornography. And then they film it \nincredible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers argued that the abuse photos were themselves* pornography \nunfit for news publications, but the consensus seems to be that they \nshine light on important truths. \"Maybe so,\" wrote NationalReview's \nJonah Goldberg.* \u0014\n\u0014\n      \"[But] if showing snapshots and images reveals the truth better \nthan words, then why do networks refuse to show 'so- called' \npartial-birth abortions? After all, that whole debate is over the \nnature of the procedure. Going to the videotape would surely settle \nit better than any news anchor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt could certainly end discussion, Neil Postman suggested. His \nAmusing Ourselves to Death (1985) asserted that images appeal to the \nemotions, never the intellect. \"The words true and false come from \nthe universe of language, and no other,\" he wrote.'' \"The photograph \nitself makes no arguable propositions, makes no extended and \nunambiguous commentary. It offers no assertions to refute, so it is \nnot refutable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPostman's point was not that pictures never lie, but that they shape \nperception with little regard for truth or reality. William Randolph \nHearst understood this when trying to push the United States into the \nSpanish- American War. When a photojournalist telegraphed that there \nwas no war to report on, Hearst responded, \"You furnish the pictures, \nI'll furnish the war.\"\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWarmongering publishers are fewer today. More common is the case of \nU.S. Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin,'~' a top official stationed in \nIraq who was last October maligned by NBC Nightly News* and the Los \nAngeles Times as some kind of 21st-century crusader. By selectively \nediting video taken at a church meeting, Boykin seemed to be saying \nthat the war against terrorism is a religious war. In fact, Boykin \ntold the church, \"Who is that enemy? It's not Osama bin Laden. Our \nenemy is a spiritual enemy.... His name is Satan.\" Media reports are \nstill replacing* Satan's name with those of Osama and Saddam, and \npicking up the quote with him saying we must fight \"in the name of \nJesus.\" Such deliberate twisting demonstrates that not all bad media \ncoverage is due to images alone. Some of it is simple invective. But \nthat oniy reiterates the point that viewers shouldn't believe \neverything they see.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe who worship the \"image of the unseen God\"* have rightly gloried in \nthe Incarnation while remaining healthily skeptical of pictures. Even \ntoday, while evangelicals aren't destroying images as they did during \nthe Reformation,* they are still wary of having any images in their \nchurches.'' They remember the Decalogue's prohibitions\" against \ngraven images, and know firsthand that images, for all their wonder, \ncan sometimes seduce us at the expense of the Word. ~\u0014",

It looked like \nit was time to do something.  They quickly constructed a pain chart \noffering Koko a scale from one to 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Koko started pointing to 9 or 10 too often, dental appointment \nwas made. And because anesthesia would be involved, her handlers used \nthe opportunity to give Koko a head-to-toe exam \"She's quite \narticulate,\" volunteer Johnpaul Slater said. \"She'll tell us how bad \nshe's feeling, how bad the pain is.\"\t \u0014\n\u0014\n\t Twelve specialists-- a Stanford cardiologist, three \nanesthesiologists, three dentists, an ear and throat specialist, two \nveterinarians, a gastroenterologist and a gynecologist-- volunteered \nto help. \u0014\n \u0014\n\t \"It's not often that we get to work on a celebrity,\" said Dr. David \nLiang, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford. \"Probably, Koko \nis less demanding.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      The team came to Koko on Saturday, bringing portable X-ray and \nultrasound machines. They set up shop at her \"apartment,\" which looks \nlike a remodeled boxcar, complete with a makeshift toilet, \ntelevision, DVD player and lots of toys.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter four hours of tests  including a colonoscopy, gynecological \nexam, dental work, X-rays an ultrasounds  doctors pronounced her fit.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Koko, who celebrated her 33rd birthday July 4 was due for a \ncheckup.

She doesn't.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer teacher, Francine Patterson, was at her side when the \nanesthesiologist prepared to put her under in the morning, and \napparently Koko asked to m~ her specialists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey crowded around her, and Koko, who plays favorites, asked one \nwoman wearing red to come closer.

Last week, the World Bank \nreleased a report showing that global growth \"accelerated sharply\" \nthis year to a rate of about 4 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBest of all, the poorer nations are leading the way. Some rich \ncountries, like the U.S. and Japan, are doing well, but the \ndeveloping world is leading this economic surge. Developing countries \nare seeing their economies expand by 6.1 percent this year - an \nunprecedented rate - and, even if you take China, India and Russia \nout of the equation, developing world growth is still around 5 \npercent. As even the cautious folks at the World Bank note, all \ndeveloping regions are growing faster this decade than they did in \nthe 1980's and 90's.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is having a wonderful effect on world poverty, because when \nregions grow, that growth is shared up and down the income ladder. In \nits report, the World Bank notes that economic growth is producing a \n\"spectacular\" decline in poverty in East and South Asia. In 1990, \nthere were roughly 472 million people in the East Asia and Pacific \nregion living on less than $1 a day. By 2001, there were 271 million \nliving in extreme poverty, and by 2015, at current projections, there \nwill only be 19 million people living under those conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nLess dramatic declines in extreme poverty have been noted around the \ndeveloping world, with the vital exception of sub-Saharan Africa. It \nnow seems quite possible that we will meet the United Nations' \nMillennium Development Goals, which were set a few years ago: the \nnumber of people living in extreme poverty will be cut in half by the \nyear 2015. As Martin Wolf of The Financial Times wrote in his recent \nbook, \"Why Globalization Works\": \"Never before have so many people - \nor so large a proportion of the world's population - enjoyed such \nlarge rises in their standard of living.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs other research confirms, these rapid improvements at the bottom of \nthe income ladder are contributing to and correlating with declines \nin illiteracy, child labor rates and fertility rates. The growth in \nthe world's poorer regions also supports the argument that we are \nseeing a drop in global inequality.\u0014\n\u0014\nEconomists have been arguing furiously about whether inequality is \nincreasing or decreasing. But it now seems likely that while \ninequality has grown within particular nations, it is shrinking among \nindividuals worldwide. The Catalan economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin \nlooked at eight measures of global inequality and found they told the \nsame story: after remaining constant during the 70's, inequality \namong individuals has since declined.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat explains all this good news? The short answer is this thing we \ncall globalization. Over the past decades, many nations have \nundertaken structural reforms to lower trade barriers, shore up \nproperty rights and free economic activity. International trade is \nsurging. The poor nations that opened themselves up to trade, \ninvestment and those evil multinational corporations saw the sharpest \npoverty declines. Write this on your forehead: Free trade reduces \nworld suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, all the news is not good. Plagued by bad governments and \nAIDS, sub-Saharan Africa has not joined in the benefits of \nglobalization. Big budget deficits in the U.S. and elsewhere threaten \nstable growth. High oil prices are a problem. Trade produces losers \nas well as winners, especially among less-skilled workers in the \ndeveloped world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut especially around Thanksgiving, it's worth appreciating some of \nthe things that have gone right, and not just sweeping reports like \nthe one from the World Bank under the rug.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's worth reminding ourselves that the key task ahead is spreading \nthe benefits of globalization to Africa and the Middle East. It's \nworth noting this perhaps not too surprising phenomenon: As free \ntrade improves the lives of people in poor countries, it is viewed \nwith suspicion by more people in rich countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust once, I'd like to see someone like Bono or Bruce Springsteen \nstand up at a concert and speak the truth to his fan base: that the \nworld is complicated and there are no free lunches. But if you really \nwant to reduce world poverty, you should be cheering on those guys in \npinstripe suits at the free-trade negotiations and those investors \njetting around the world. Thanks, in part, to them, we are making \nprogress against poverty. Thanks, in part, to them, more people \naround the world have something to be thankful for.\u0014",

    "title": "GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL: A PSYCHIATRIST AND DELIVERANCE-A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "From Publishers Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 1983 bestseller, People of the Lie, Peck devoted a chapter to \nexorcism. In this astonishing new book, the megaselling author of The \nRoad Less Traveled reveals his work as an exorcist and attempts to \nestablish a science of exorcism for future research. Peck knows that \nmany readers will be skeptical of or flummoxed by his report, and \nthus he emphasizes that he himself scoffed at the idea of demonic \npossession before encountering Jersey Babcock; Peck became involved \nin her case mostly to \"prove the devil's nonexistence as \nscientifically as possible.\" But a comment by Jersey at their first \nmeeting \"blew the thing wide open.\" Jersey, a Texas resident who \nbelieved she was possessed and who was neglecting her children as a \nresult, said that her demons were \"really rather weak and pathetic \ncreatures\"a statement so at odds with, as Peck puts it, \"standard \npsychopathology\" that his mind began to change. Peck describes two \ncases in this book, that of Jersey and the more difficult case of \nBeccah Armitage, a middle-aged woman who grew up in an abusive \nfamily, married an abusive husband and was practicing self-mutilation \nwhen Peck took her case. Both cases result in full-blown exorcisms \nwith Peck as the lead exorcist, and both, according to Peck, involved \nparanormal phenomena, including Beccah acquiring a snakelike \nappearance. Peck intersperses his calm but dramatic recitation of \nthese cases with set-off commentary, and he concludes the book with a \nreasoned proposal for a science of exorcism (\"An exorcism is a \nmassive therapeutic intervention to liberate, teach, and support the \nvictim to choose to reject the devil\"). A report from what is to most \nof us a strange and distant land, Scott's book probably won't \nconvince crowds, but it's powerful and concisely written enough to \ninterest many, and maybe to give a few pause for thought. (Jan. 19)\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\nWhen famous-name, prepublication endorsements were solicited for \nPeck's first book, the subsequent perennial best-seller The Road Less \nTraveled (1978), only Malachi Martin responded. Who? thought Peck, \nand proceeded to find and read Martin's then latest book, Hostage to \nthe Devil (1976), about five exorcisms of modern Americans. \nIncreasingly concerned with the existence of human evil but not then \nbelieving in the devil, Peck sought Martin out and made one of the \nmost crucial acquaintances of his life. Because of Martin's firm, \ngentle influence, Peck was baptized a Christian (nondenominational, \nhe stresses) and eventually became principal exorcist in two cases \nencountered in the course of his psychiatric practice. This book \nreports diagnosis, exorcism, and follow-up in each case. Jersey, a \nyoung mother who was neglecting her small children and becoming \nabsorbed in a New Age cult, was referred to Peck as possibly \npossessed. Wealthy self-made businesswoman Beccah, 45, was a \nsingularly intransigent long-term patient of Peck's who he concluded \nwas possessed. Both women's exorcisms incorporated the Roman Catholic \nritual of exorcism, and both were undertaken by teams of six or more \npersons--fewer, Peck says, is risky, as Beccah's exorcism in \nparticular convinced him--and were videotaped. Both succeeded, but \none didn't stick. Peck's accounts of them are riveting, and his \nanalysis of each is perspicacious enough and humble enough on his \npart to cause, perhaps, believers and skeptics of the devil alike to \ndeepen and reevaluate their positions.

Those things that can be said, I have tried to \nsay with clarity, but take them with a grain of salt. That is how I \ntake them myself. If and when it seems I am speaking with excessive \ncertainty, I hope you will remember that had I expressed all of my \nown reservations, much of the book would have been unreadable. My \nonly alternative would have been to write nothing at all. But that, I \nbelieve, would have been the greater sin. These things need to be \ntalked of.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan is evil spirit. \"Evil\" is a dangerous word. Speak it carefully \n-- full of care. It is not to be used lightly. Try your best to do no \nharm with it. Be gentle with yourself as well as others. Yet remember \nthose three famous monkeys covering their eyes and ears and mouth: \nSee no evil; hear no evil; speak no evil. I think the wise person who \nthought them up was trying to tell us they were stupid little \nmonkeys, monkeys of denial.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe focus of this work has been Satan first, possession second, and \nonly slightly on evil. Readers interested in the general phenomenon \nof evil should read my 1983 book, People of the Lie.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope recently directed that every Roman Catholic diocese should \nhave a diocesan exorcist. People with a serious personal concern \nabout possession in regard to themselves or others should seek out \nthe exorcist in their diocese. How well trained or experienced that \nperson might be I have no idea. Regrettably, on account of my health \nand retirement, I myself am no longer able to be of any assistance as \na clinician or advisor except to the church. Remember that genuine \npossession is a very rare phenomenon. The diagnosis, like that of \nevil, is not one to be bandied about.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 by M. Scott Peck\u0014\nThe legendary bestselling author and renowned psychiatrist M. Scott \nPeck, whose books have sold over 14 million copies, reveals the \namazing true story of his work as an exorcist -- kept secret for more \nthan twenty-five years -- in two profoundly human stories of satanic \npossession.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the tradition of his million-copy bestseller People of the Lie: \nThe Hope for Healing Human Evil, Scott Peck's new book offers the \nfirst complete account of exorcism and possession by a modern \npsychiatrist in this extraordinary personal narrative of his efforts \nto heal patients suffering from demonic and satanic possession.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first time, Dr. Peck discusses his experience in conducting \nexorcisms, sharing the spellbinding details of his two major cases: \none a moving testament to his healing abilities, and the other a \nperilous and ultimately unsuccessful struggle against darkness and \nevil. Twenty-seven-year-old Jersey was of average intelligence; a \ncaring and devoted wife and mother to her husband and two young \ndaughters, she had no history of mental illness. Beccah, in her \nmid-forties and with a superior intellect, had suffered from profound \ndepression throughout her life, choosing to remain in an abusive \nrelationship with her husband, one dominated by distrust and greed.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil the day Dr. Peck first met the young woman called Jersey, he \ndid not believe in the devil. In fact, as a mature, highly \nexperienced psychiatrist, he expected that this case would resolve \nhis ongoing effort to prove to himself, as scientifically as \npossible, that there were absolutely no grounds for such beliefs. Yet \nwhat he discovered could not be explained away simply as madness or \nby any standard clinical diagnosis. Through a series of unanticipated \nevents, Dr. Peck found himself thrust into the role of exorcist, and \nhis desire to treat and help Jersey led him down a path of blurred \nboundaries between science and religion. Once there, he came \nface-to-face with deeply entrenched evil and ultimately witnessed the \noverwhelming healing power of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Glimpses of the Devil, Dr. Peck's celebrated gift for integrating \npsychiatry and religion is demonstrated yet again as he recounts his \njourney from skepticism to eventual acknowledgment of the reality of \nan evil spirit, even at the risk of being shunned by the medical \nestablishment. In the process, he also finds himself compelled to \nconfront the larger paradox of free will, of a commitment to goodness \nversus enslavement to the forms of evil, and the monumental clash of \nforces that endangers both sanity and the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nGlimpses of the Devil is unquestionably among Scott Peck's most \npowerful, scrupulously written, and important books in many years. At \nonce deeply sensitive and intensely chilling, it takes a clear-eyed \nlook at one of the most mysterious and misunderstood areas of human \nexperience.\u0014",

    "words": "General Is Scolded for Saying, 'It's Fun to Shoot Some People'\u0014\nBy ERIC SCHMITT\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: February 4, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 3 - A senior Marine general who commanded forces in \nIraq and Afghanistan has been admonished by the commandant of the \nMarine Corps for saying publicly, \"It's fun to shoot some people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLt. Gen. James N. Mattis, an infantry officer who is a revered figure \namong marines for his fierce demeanor and warrior ethos, made the \ncomments on Tuesday while speaking to a forum in San Diego about \nstrategies for the war against terror.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nAccording to an audio recording of General Mattis's remarks obtained \nby The Associated Press, he said: \"Actually, it's a lot of fun to \nfight. You know, it's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some \npeople. I'll be right upfront with you, I like brawling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe added, \"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women \naround for five years because they didn't wear a veil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneral Mattis continued: \"You know, guys like that ain't got no \nmanhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday, Gen. Michael W. Hagee, commandant of the Marine Corps, \nissued a statement saying, \"I have counseled him concerning his \nremarks, and he agrees he should have chosen his words more \ncarefully.\" General Hagee added, \"While I understand that some people \nmay take issue with the comments made by him, I also know he intended \nto reflect the unfortunate and harsh realities of war.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneral Mattis is now the commanding officer of the Marine Corps \nCombat Development Command in Quantico, Va., which is responsible for \ndeveloping Marine war-fighting doctrine, techniques and tactics. A \nspokeswoman for the general said he agreed that he should have chosen \nhis words more carefully and that he considered the matter closed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe general is no stranger to controversy. After marines under his \ncommand seized an airstrip in Afghanistan at the start of the war \nagainst the Taliban, he declared, \"The Marines have landed, and we \nnow own a piece of Afghanistan.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remark grated on Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who with \nother Pentagon officials considered the remark impolitic given the \nadministration's stated goal that the United States was freeing \nAfghanistan from the tyranny of the Taliban, not seizing land in a \nMuslim nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs commander of the First Marine Division in the Iraq war, General \nMattis ordered his force on a high-speed race from Kuwait to Baghdad, \nsowing confusion among Iraqi units along the way with the maneuver.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen one of his regimental commanders, Col. Joe D. Dowdy, was not \naggressive enough for General Mattis, the general stripped the \nsubordinate of his battlefield command, a highly unusual step in \nwartime.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a Pentagon briefing on Thursday, Mr. Rumsfeld said he had not read \nGeneral Mattis's remarks and declined to comment on them.\u0014\n\u0014\nGen. Peter Pace, a Marine officer who is vice chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, said at the same briefing that he would let General \nMattis speak for himself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But I will tell you,\" General Pace said, \"that the last three times \nthat that general has been in combat, when he was leading marines in \nAfghanistan, and the two times that he led his division in Iraq, his \nactions, and those of his troops, clearly show that he understands \nthe value of proper leadership and the value of human life.\"\u0014",

    "title": "GOD AND EVOLUTION",
    "words": "God and Evolution\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\n\u0014\nFebruary 12, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nAn \"analysis\" of Democrats and Republicans from the Ladies' Home \nJournal in 1962 concluded: \"Republicans sleep in twin beds - some \neven in separate rooms. That is why there are more Democrats.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat biological analysis turns out - surprise! - to have been \nsuperficial. Instead, modern science is turning up a possible reason \nwhy the religious right is flourishing and secular liberals aren't: \ninstinct. It turns out that our DNA may predispose humans toward \nreligious faith.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nAdvertisement\u0014\n\u0014\nGranted, that's not very encouraging news for the secular left. \nImagine if many of us are hard-wired to be religious. Imagine if, as \na cosmic joke, humans have gradually evolved to leave many of us \ndoubting evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notion of a genetic inclination toward religion is not new. \nEdward Wilson, the founder of the field of sociobiology, argued in \nthe 1970's that a predisposition to religion may have had \nevolutionary advantages.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years evidence has mounted that there may be something to \nthis, and the evidence is explored in \"The God Gene,\" a fascinating \nbook published recently by Dean Hamer, a prominent American \ngeneticist. Dr. Hamer even identifies a particular gene, VMAT2, that \nhe says may be involved. People with one variant of that gene tend to \nbe more spiritual, he found, and those with another variant to be \nless so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's still plenty of reason to be skeptical because Dr. Hamer's \nwork hasn't been replicated, and much of his analysis is speculative. \nMoreover, any genetic predisposition isn't for becoming an \nevangelical, but for an openness to spirituality at a much broader \nlevel. In Alabama, it may express itself in Pentecostalism; in \nCalifornia, in astrology or pyramids.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, it's striking how faith is almost irrepressible. While I was \nliving in China in the early 1990's, after religion had been \nsuppressed for decades, drivers suddenly began dangling pictures of \nChairman Mao from their rear-view mirrors. The word had spread that \nMao's spirit could protect them from car crashes or even bring them \nsons and wealth. It was a miracle: ordinary Chinese had transformed \nthe great atheist into a god.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne bit of evidence supporting a genetic basis for spirituality is \nthat twins separated at birth tend to have similar levels of \nspirituality, despite their different upbringings. And identical \ntwins, who have the same DNA, are about twice as likely to share \nsimilar levels of spirituality as fraternal twins.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not surprising that nature would favor genes that promote an \ninclination to faith. Many recent studies suggest that religious \npeople may live longer than the less religious. A study of nearly \n4,000 people in North Carolina, for example, found that frequent \nchurchgoers had a 46 percent lower risk of dying in a six-year period \nthan those who attended less often. Another study involving nearly \n126,000 participants suggested that a 20-year-old churchgoer might \nlive seven years longer than a similar person who does not attend \nreligious services.\u0014\n\u0014\nPartly that's because the religious seem to adopt healthier \nlifestyles - they are less likely to smoke, for example. And faith \nmay give people strength to overcome illness - after all, if faith in \nplacebo sugar pills works, why not faith in God?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother possibility involves brain chemistry. Genes that promote \nspirituality may do so in part by stimulating chemical messengers in \nthe brain like dopamine, which can make people optimistic and \nsociable - and perhaps more likely to have children. (Dopamine is \nvery complex, but it appears linked to both spirituality and \npromiscuity, possibly explaining some church scandals.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEvolutionary biologists have also suggested that an inclination to \nspirituality may have made ancient humans more willing to follow \nwitch doctors or other leaders who claimed divine support. The result \nwould have been more cohesive bands of cave men, better able to \nsurvive - and to kill off rival cave men.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, none of that answers the question of whether God exists. \nThe faithful can believe that God wired us to appreciate divinity. \nAnd atheists can argue that God may simply be a figment of our VMAT2 \ngene.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what the research does suggest is that postindustrial society \nwill not easily leave religion behind. Faith may be quiescent in many \ncircles these days, or directed toward meditation or yoga, but it is \nnot something that humans can easily cast off.\u0014\n\u0014\nA propensity to faith in some form appears to be embedded within us \nas a profound part of human existence, as inextricable and perhaps \ninexplicable as the way we love and laugh.\u0014",

    "title": "GRANT AND TWAIN -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "They were both frontier boys, sons of proud, successful, and often \nindifferent fathers. Both were intelligent, articulate, well \neducated, and quietly ambitious; and as young men, both shared the \nsame dream of traveling on the big steamboats of the Mississippi \nRiver. Both had an urgent need of money, and because of this, both \nwere driven to finish writing books that each became landmarks of \nAmerican letters, one fiction, the other non-fiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nA mutually beneficial relationship\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Twain and Ulysses Grant had a relationship forged in friendship \nthat was mutually beneficial. Twain worshipped Grant; according to \nhis biographer, he was a Grant-intoxicated man, and he encouraged \nthe war hero and ex-president to write his memoirs, finally \npublishing them himself. And it was during the 15-month period when \nthe dying Grant finished his work that Twain brought out Huckleberry \nFinn, which he believed to be his greatest book.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Perry chronicles that relationship in Grant and Twain: The Story \nof a Friendship that Changed America, blending together three \ninterrelated stories: Grants struggle to complete his memoirs, \nbefore the cancer that was ravaging his body finally killed him; \nTwains efforts to finish Huckleberry Finn, on which he had been \nstalled for nine years; and both mens attempts to understand and \nexplain their era.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrant did not seriously consider writing his memoirs until sometime \nafter May 1884, when Grant & Ward, the investment firm in which he \nwas a partner along with his son, Buck, and Ferdinand Ward went \nbankrupt, and he was forced to find a way to pay his creditors and \nguarantee financial stability for his family. Up to that time, hed \nhad no confidence in his ability as a writer, despite the fact that \nas early as 1881, Twain had assured him that such a book would have \nan enormous sale. It was his dire financial straits, coupled with \nthe discovery of his cancer in October, that induced him to embark on \nthe project.\u0014\n\u0014\nA grim race against death\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Grant wrote, a colorful cross-section of America were drawn to his \nside: war veteransboth Yank and Rebel; a self-promoting preacher \n(who would later deliver a 90-minute eulogy); publishing types; a \nloyal black servant; a con-man sculptor, who had already conned \nthousands from Twain. In the end, as he grew sicker, Grants work \nbecame a grim race against time. Four days after completing his last \nhand-written revisions, on the morning of July 23, 1885, he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Perry has created a unique dual biography that not only brings \nto life two of the most dramatic figures of 19th-century America, but \nalso gives us an absorbing picture of the machinations of publishing, \nand how two very different writers went about their work.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the author: Mark Perry is a writer, reporter, and \nforeign-policy analyst. He is the author of five critically acclaimed \nbooks, including Eclipse: The Last Days of the CIA, A Fire in Zion: \nThe Israeli-Palestinian Search for Peace, and Conceived in Liberty: \nJoshua Chamberlain, William Oates, and the American Civil War. He \nlives in Arlington, Virginia.\u0014",

    "words": "A minister concluded that his church was getting into serious \nfinancial troubles.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoincidentally, by chance, while checking the church storeroom, he \ndiscovered several\u0014\ncartons of new bibles that had never been opened and distributed; So \nat  his Sunday sermon, he asked\u0014\nfor three volunteers from the congregation who would be willing to \nsell the bibles door-to-door for $10 each to raise desperately needed \nmoney for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter, Paul and Louie all raised  their hands to volunteer for the \ntask. The reverend knew that Peter and\u0014\nPaul earned their livings as salesmen and were likely capable of \nselling some bibles, but he had serious doubts about Louie who was \njust a little local  farmer who had always tended to\u0014\nkeep to himself because he was embarrassed  by his speech impediment.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoor little Louis stuttered badly. But, not wanting to discourage \npoor Louis, the reverend decided to let\u0014\nhim try anyway. He sent the three of them away with the back seat of \ntheir cars stacked with bibles and asked them to meet  with him and \nreport the  results of  their door-to-door selling efforts the\u0014\nfollowing Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they got together, the reverend immediately asked Peter, \"Well, \nPeter, how did you make out selling our bibles last week?\" Proudly \nhanding the reverend an envelope, Peter replied, \"Pastor,\u0014\nusing my sales prowess, I was able  to sell 20 bibles, and here's the \n$200 collected on behalf of the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fine job, Peter!\" the reverend said, vigorously shaking his hand. \n\"You are indeed a fine salesman and\u0014\nthe Church is indebted to you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTurning to Paul, he asked \"And how many bibles did you manage to sell \nfor the church last week?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul, smiling and sticking out his chest, confidently \nreplied,\"Reverend, I am a professional salesman and was happy to give \nthe church the benefit of my expertise. Last week I sold 28 bibles on \nbehalf of the\u0014\nchurch, and here's $280 I collected.\" The reverend responded, \"That's \nabsolutely splendid, Paul. You\u0014\nare truly a professional salesman and the church is also indebted to \nyou.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nApprehensively, the reverend turned to little Louie and said, \"And \nLouie, did you manage to sell any\u0014\nbibles last week?\" Louie silently offered the reverend a large \nenvelope. The reverend opened it and counted the contents. \"What is \nthis?\" the reverend exclaimed. \"Louie, there's $3200 in here! Are you \nsuggesting that you sold 320 bibles for the church, door to door, in \njust one week?\u0014\nLouie just nodded. \"That's impossible!\" both Peter and Paul said in \nunison. \"We are professional salesmen, yet you claim to have sold 10 \ntimes as many bibles as we could.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, this does seem unlikely,\" the reverend agreed. \"Please explain \nhow you managed to accomplish this, Louie.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLouie shrugged. \"I-I-I- re-re-really  do-do-don't kn-kn-know \nf-f-f-for sh-sh-sh-sure,\" he stammered.\u0014\nImpatiently, Peter interrupted. \"For crying out loud, Louie, just \ntell us what you said to them when they\u0014\nanswered the door!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A-a-a-all I-I-I s-s-said wa-wa-was,\" Louis replied, \"W-w-w-w-would  \ny-y-y-you l-l-l-l-l-like t-t-to b-b-b-buy th-th-th-this b-b-b-b-bible \nf-f-for t-t-ten b-b-b-bucks o-o-o-or--- wo-wo-would yo-you j-j-j-just \nl-like -m-me\u0014\nt-t-to st-stand h-h-here and r-r-r-r-r-read it t-to y-y-you?\"\u0014",

    "words": "Village Gang-Rape Sentences Are Upset by Court in Pakistan\u0014\nBy SALMAN MASOOD\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: March 4, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 3 - Five men sentenced to death in 2002 \nfor their role in a gang rape that was approved by a council in a \nremote Pakistani village had their convictions overturned Thursday. A \nsixth man convicted in the case, which set off worldwide outrage, had \nhis death sentence commuted to life in prison, lawyers in the case \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe circumstances of the rape, in June 2002 in Meerwala, in southern \nPunjab Province, brought demands for justice, and the government \nmoved fast to bring the case to trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the prosecution, the Meerwala council ordered the gang \nrape of Mukhtar Mai, then 30, as punishment for the alleged illicit \nsexual relations of her brother Shakoor with a woman from the rival \nMastoi tribe.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was later revealed that he had been molested by Mastoi men who \ntried to conceal it by accusing him of illicit relations with a \nMastoi woman. The Mastoi demanded revenge. That was delivered when \nthe council approved the rape of Ms. Mukhtar.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourteen men were charged in the case and six of them - the leader of \nthe village council, a council member and the four men suspected of \ncarrying out the rape - were convicted and sentenced to death in \nSeptember 2002. The convicted men appealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo High Court judges, in their decision on Thursday, cited loopholes \nin the prosecution case and faulty police investigations, Pakistani \nnews media reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefense lawyers said the 2002 decision was \"influenced by media hype \nand government pressure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Mukhtar said she was disappointed at the latest decision, and \nblamed her lawyers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case gained international prominence because the assault was \napproved by the village council. The councils have no legal authority \nbut are used in remote areas because of the poor reach of central \nauthority. Public outcry led the government to place the case in an \nantiterrorism court and give Ms. Mukhtar police guards and $8,300 in \ncompensation.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe has won praise for speaking out after the rape and for using the \nmoney to set up schools. Since the first trial, she said, she had \nfaced death threats. She said Thursday's ruling intensified her fear. \n\"We are afraid for our lives, but we will face whatever fate brings \nfor us.\"\u0014",

Although the old man and his clothes were \nspotlessly clean, he wore jeans, a denim shirt and boots that were \nvery worn and ragged. In his hand he carried a worn-out old hat and \nan equally worn-out old Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church he entered was in a very upscale and exclusive part of the \ncity. It was the largest and most beautiful church the old cowboy had \never seen. It had high cathedral ceilings, ornate statues, beautiful \nmurals and stained-glass windows, plush carpet and velvetlike \ncushioned pews. The building must have cost many millions of dollars \nto build and maintain. The men, women and children of the \ncongregation were all dressed in the finest and most expensive suits, \ndresses, shoes and jewelry the old cowboy had ever witnessed. As the \npoorly dressed cowboy took a seat, the others moved away from him. No \none greeted him. No one welcomed him. No one offered a handshake. No \none spoke to him. They were all appalled at his appearance and did \nnot attempt to hide the fact. There were many glances in his \ndirection as the others frowned and commented among themselves about \nhis shabby attire. A few chuckles and giggles came from some of the \nyounger members.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the old cowboy was leaving the church, the preacher approached \nhim. Instead of welcoming him, the preacher asked the cowboy to do \nhim a favor. Before you come back in here again, have a talk with \nGod and ask him what he thinks would be appropriate attire for \nworshiping in this church, the preacher said. The old cowboy assured \nthe preacher he would do that and left.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe very next Sunday morning the old cowboy showed back up for the \nservices wearing the same ragged jeans, shirt, boots and hat. Once \nagain the congregation was appalled at his appearance. He was \ncompletely shunned and ignored again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe preacher noticed the man still wearing his ragged clothes and \nboots, and instead of beginning his sermon, stepped down from the \npulpit and walked over to where the man sat alone. I thought I asked \nyou to speak to God before you came back to our church, the preacher \nsaid. I did, replied the old cowboy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you spoke to God, what did he tell you the proper attire should \nbe for worshiping in here? asked the preacher. Well sir, said the \nold cowboy, God told me that he wouldnt have the slightest idea \nwhat was appropriate attire for worshiping in your church. He says \nhes never even been in here.\u0014",

At Highbury \nTheological College, he received his divinity degree, and in 1850 he \nbecame a pastor of a Congregational church in Arundel. Early the \nfollowing year, he married Louisa Powell, with whom he enjoyed a long \nand happy marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scotsman was forced to resign his pulpit in 1853 because he liked \nto dabble in \"German theology,\" meaning the new higher critical \napproach to biblical studies emerging from that country. He never \ntook another church but spent the rest of his life lecturing, \npreaching, and especially writing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 1851 and 1897, he wrote over 50 books in all manner of genre: \nnovels, plays, essays, sermons, poems, and fairy tales. And then \nthere were his two fantasies for adults, Phantastes (1858) and Lilith \n(1895), which defy categorization. During these years, Lewis Carroll \nbecame a good friend and gave him the first manuscript of Alice in \nWonderland to read to his children. Other British literary \nluminarieslike John Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, Lord Tennyson, and \nMatthew Arnoldwere among his associates and admirers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen McDonald visited the United States in 1872 for a lecture tour, \nthe likes of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John \nGreenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Mark Twain paid him \nhomage. After his stay in New York City, one large Fifth Avenue \nchurch offered him the almost unheard of salary of $20,000 a year to \nbecome its pastor. MacDonald thought the idea preposterous.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis success did not exempt him from more-than-ordinary suffering. \nPoverty plagued him so much that his family occasionally faced \nliteral starvation. His own lungs were diseased, and tuberculosis \nkilled two brothers and two half-sisters. It also ravaged his \nchildren, four of whom died before him. He himself had a stroke at \nage 74 and lapsed into virtual silence for the last seven years of \nhis life.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, MacDonald believed suffering was finally redemptive: \"All \npains, indeed, and all sorrows, all demons, yea, and all sins \nthemselves, under the suffering care of the highest minister, are but \nthe ministers of truth and righteousness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInspiring writers\u0014\nMacDonald eventually became an Anglican, but he never had much \npatience with high theology or liturgyhe said it often stood in the \nway of people encountering Christ personally. Furthermore, it wasn't \njust the church but all of creation that revealed God: \"With his \ndivine alchemy, he [God] turns not only water into wine, but common \nthings into radiant mysteries, yea, every meal into a Eucharist, and \nthe jaws of death into an outgoing gate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMacDonald's popularity has faded with time, though he retains a \nsmall, loyal following, and his The Fairy and the Goblin (1872) and \nThe Fairy and Curdie (1883) are still read by children. But in his \nday, he inspired not a few of the 20th century's favorite writers, \nlike G.K. Chesterton, J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and C.S. \nLewis, to name four. \"I have never concealed the fact that I regarded \nhim as my master,\" wrote Lewis; \"indeed I fancy I have never written \na book in which I did not quote from him.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Girl, 8, Found Buried Alive in Trash Bin\u0014\n\u0014\nGirl, 8, Found Buried Alive in Trash Bin at Landfill in Florida; Says \nShe Was Waiting for Rescue\u0014\nBy JILL BARTON\u0014\nThe Associated Press\u0014\n\u0014\nMay. 23, 2005 - An 8-year-old girl who was raped and buried alive \ntold a friend she remembers her attacker towering over her before she \npassed out, then awoke seven hours later beneath a pile of rocks and \nconcrete blocks when she heard the voices of rescuers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl, who had been staying overnight at her godmother's house, \nwas reported missing early Sunday. She was hospitalized in good \ncondition Monday and a teenage boy who also had been staying at the \nhome was arrested. Authorities said he confessed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She said the last thing she remembers is that he looked over her \nwith these big eyes and then she said she went to sleep. She said she \nwas waiting for us to find her,\" said 18-year-old Danielle Holloman, \na family friend who calls the girl her sister.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She said she knew we would come get her. That's why as soon as the \npolice came, she wiggled her fingers,\" Holloman said Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl was found Sunday morning when police Sgt. Mike Hall climbed \ninto a 25-foot long trash bin, opened the lid to a 30-gallon \nrecycling container and saw part of the girl's hand and foot peeking \nout from under heavy concrete slabs, said police Sgt. Dan Boland.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said rescuers feared the worst, but their mood turned jubilant \nwhen they realized she was alive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that this child would have been dead if \nhe didn't find her. She was dehydrated and in rough shape with pieces \nof cement blocks on top of her and she was face down,\" Boland said. \n\"There was no way for her to get out on her own.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe had been sexually assaulted, authorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer disappearance rattled a state that had been outraged over the \narrests of sex offenders in the separate killings earlier this year \nof 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford and 13-year-old Sarah Lunde.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When a child is abducted and abandoned like this, the critical thing \nis time,\" Police Chief William Smith said. \"That we found this child \nalive is a miracle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 8-year-old had been staying overnight at her godmother's house. \nAfter police found her, the girl named her attacker and described \nhim. The teenage boy she named, a friend who was staying in the home, \nwas arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities said Milagro Cunningham, 17, confessed and was charged \nwith attempted murder, sexual battery on a child under 12, and false \nimprisonment of a victim under age 13, police said. A court \nappearance was scheduled Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe teen initially told investigators that the girl may have been \nabducted by five men in a station wagon, and that he tried to follow \nthem. He changed his story during questioning, Boland said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a good person. He would clean and do chores, laugh and play \njokes and stuff. We never thought he would do something like that,\" \nHolloman said. \"The only reason I can think he went crazy like this \nis his father died and his mother didn't want him. Nobody wanted him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHolloman said the teen stayed with an aunt until she kicked him out \nabout four months ago. He then went to live at the home of Lisa \nTaylor, Holloman's mother, where the victim occasionally spent \nweekends while her mother worked.\u0014\n\u0014\nCunningham's aunt had accused him of stealing and the teen has a \nrelatively minor criminal record, authorities said. He was on \nprobation for throwing a rock through a car window.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor was asleep when the girl vanished from the bedroom she was \nsharing with Holloman's 1-year-old son. Holloman and her sister \ndiscovered the girl was missing when they came home after a night of \nroller-skating, authorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA half hour later, Cunningham knocked on the door and the sisters \nfound him with his shirt torn and his clothes covered with dirt. \nInvestigators said that's when he started telling his story about the \nmen in the station wagon.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities said the girl was found far enough from any homes that no \none would likely have heard if she had cried out. The trash bin was \nin a fenced-off former landfill behind a park where she often played \nwith Holloman, Holloman's son and other friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2005 The Associated Press.

    "words": "Gucci Gets Help from \nMussolini\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1898, Guccio Gucci was desperate to earn a living. The 17-year-old \nmade his way from Florence, Italy to the coast with virtually no \nmoney and signed on to work in the engine room of a freighter bound \nfor the British Isles. Gucci jumped ship in London, and though he \ncouldn't speak much English, he talked his way into a job washing \ndishes at the glamorous Savoy Hotel, and was eventually promoted to \nwaiter. The Savoy inspired Gucci to start a business, one that years \nlater would be fatefully shaped by the government of Benito \nMussolini. \u0014\n\u0014\nGucci watched the wealthy arrive daily at the door of the hotel with \nexpensive luggage--mountains of leather, embossed crests, and \nornately tooled straps. He returned to Florence with his earnings, \nand in 1922 opened a small shop, specializing in expensive \nall-leather luggage, handbags, and saddlery, much of it custom made \nfor an upper-class clientele. Then, in 1935, Mussolini's Fascist \ngovernment imposed sanctions on the country that prevented Gucci from \nobtaining all the tanned leather he needed. To survive, he created \nnew product lines that combined canvas and leather. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs even canvas became scarce, Gucci experimented with other resources \nfor handbags, such as bamboo, which became a signature material. \nAfter the Fascists were driven from power, the Gucci family \nbusiness--now with stores in Rome and Milan, too--continued to \ndistinguish its bags and luggage with unique materials and designs, \nalways stressing high-quality workmanship. The most renowned Gucci \nitems are among a collection preserved for posterity by the Museum of \nModern Art in New York, including an original canvas and leather bag.\u0014",

    "words": "Sunday, Aug. 20, 2006\u0014\n\u0014\nThe War For China's Soul\u0014\nAs Christianity begins to reshape the nation, TIME learns new details \nabout a crackdown on one church\u0014\n\u0014\nBy SIMON ELEGANT / NANJING \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral weeks after the attack, the witness is still trembling. \n\"Everyone knew trouble was coming,\" the man says, describing the day \nlast month that haunts him still. A fit-looking fortysomething \nwearing a T shirt and jeans, the man was a volunteer working on a \nhalf-completed church in a suburb of Hangzhou, a picturesque lakeside \ncity 112 miles southwest of Shanghai. Financed by local Christians, \nthe church was to serve a community of 5,000 parishioners. Hundreds \nof them gathered at the site on the afternoon of July 29, some \njoining the construction crew building the church. Others, many of \nthem elderly parishioners, sat on plastic chairs surrounding the \nchurch, singing hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christians surely knew they were testing the patience of local \ngovernment officials, who insisted the building was illegal and had \nto be torn down. But few were prepared for what happened next. \nWitnesses told TIME that at about 2:30 p.m., thousands of uniformed \npolice and plainclothes security officers appeared at the \nconstruction site. The police cleared a way through the crowds for a \nfew drill-equipped backhoes, and the authorities then demolished the \nchurch. Witnesses say police bludgeoned people indiscriminately with \nnightsticks. \"They were picking up women--some of them old ladies--by \ntheir hair and swinging them around like dolls, then letting them \ncrash to the ground,\" says a man who watched the clash from across \nthe street. A statement faxed to TIME by the information office of \nthe Xiaoshan district government describes the scene differently, \nclaiming that about 100 Christians \"attacked and injured government \nofficials\" and that although the police detained a few protesters, \nnone were injured. But the volunteer interviewed by TIME produced \nreceipts from the local hospital attesting to his treatment for \nbroken ribs, which he says many others suffered as well. \"They \ntreated us like dead dogs,\" he says. \"Some of them scoffed at us as \nwe lay there, saying, 'Where is your God now? Why can't he help you? \nIf you want to go to heaven, we'll help you get there right now.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crackdown in Hangzhou may seem unremarkable for a country where a \npublic demonstration of any kind can still trigger a brutal \ngovernment response. For openly religious Chinese, in particular, \nthat's a constant threat. Human-rights groups regularly report cases \nof harassment, temporary detention and even long-term imprisonment of \npriests and their followers. But the Hangzhou episode is also \nunmistakable evidence that Christianity is transforming Chinese \nsociety.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter four failed attempts over a millennium and a half by foreign \nmissionaries to gain a foothold in China, Christianity is finally \ntaking root and evolving into a truly Chinese religion. Estimates \nvary, but some experts say Christians make up 5% of China's \npopulation, or 65 million believers. And thousands more are \nconverting every day, the vast majority through unofficial \"house\" \nchurches like the one that sparked the clash in Hangzhou. \n\"Politically, China hasn't changed at all,\" says Dennis Balcombe, who \nhas spent the past three decades evangelizing in China from his base \nin Hong Kong. \"But as far as religion is concerned, it is much, much \nfreer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe flowering of Chinese Christianity reflects a wider religious \nawakening. Long criticized by Western governments and human-rights \ngroups for its virulently antireligious policies, China's central \ngovernment has in recent years adopted a more lenient attitude toward \nreligious expression. Traditionally, the Communist Party allowed \nmembership in five officially approved religions: Buddhism, Taoism, \nIslam, Protestant Christianity and Catholicism. Anything falling \noutside those groups was officially shunned. Even those adhering to \n\"approved\" religions have to register to worship in churches and \ntemples approved by the state. But those rules are becoming harder to \nenforce. These days, Chinese flock to everything from mystical Taoist \nsects to huge, prosperous Buddhist temples and spiritually based \nexercise and meditation systems.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe growth of spirituality poses a challenge for China's ruling \nclass, which pays little more than lip service to communist ideology \nbut still strives to control its restive populace. Faced with a \nsocial phenomenon that would use up huge amounts of time, manpower \nand international goodwill to curb, Beijing's cadres have decided to \ntolerate the new churches so long as they keep a low profile. The \nmore outspoken and organized such groups become, however, the greater \nthe threat they pose to the authority of the Communist Party. For the \nmoment, that influence is confined to local issues related to their \nfaith, such as church building and education. But observers say the \nchallenge could grow, as churches continue to spread out of the \ncountryside and into the cities, where they draw from the ranks of \nthe rapidly growing middle class. \"If you look at Chinese history, \nall the rebellions that led to change of dynasty had some religious \nconnotations,\" says Jean-Paul Wiest, an expert in the history of \nChristianity in China who teaches at Beijing's University of \nInternational Business and Economics. \"The authorities don't like \nthat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere may not be much they can do about it. Across the country, \nChristians are worshipping with a fervor once unimaginable in a \ncommunist society. Take the service held at 10 o'clock on a recent \nSunday morning in China's booming southern city of Shenzhen. Some 40 \npeople are crowded into the living room of a small two-bedroom \napartment. The regulars call the place the Home of Love, and like the \nmajority of Chinese Christians, they worship in private because they \ncan't--or won't--register with the government-controlled official \nProtestant Church, the so-called Three-Self Church (the church's name \nrefers to its three guiding principles of self-reliance). The cries \nof hawkers selling vegetables and fruits in the alleyway below drift \nthrough the grimy windows, but the worshippers have eyes only for the \nfront of the room, where a plump, middle-aged preacher in a tight \ngray suit stands at a small lectern. Behind him is a large wooden \ncross draped with a white cotton cloth. Several pictures of Jesus \nhang on the walls, and Chinese characters phonetically spelling out \nEmanuel--\"Yi-man-nei-yi\"--frame an archway.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of fears that officers from the Public Security Bureau might \ndisrupt the proceedings, which are illegal, services in house \nchurches are often low-key. Not at the Home of Love. The congregation \nstarts by belting out a series of hymns to an accompanying sound \ntrack booming out of several large loudspeakers. After the singing, \nthe preacher launches into a sermon extolling the growth of \nChristianity in China. Then he steps among the tightly packed \nworshippers, holding their heads and praying over them, chanting what \nwould sound to most Chinese like gibberish. Soon most of the room has \njoined him in fervent, noisy prayer, many swaying back and forth, \neyes squeezed shut, moaning, shouting, wailing. One woman repeats \nover and over, \"Oh mashalah, oh Yesu, oh mashalah, oh Yesu, oh Yesu, \noh Yesu.\" (Yesu is Jesus; mashalah seems to mean nothing.) The \nwoman's face is clenched in ecstasy; tears run down her cheeks.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo far, the government hasn't done much to halt the spread of such \nhothouses of faith. But that may be changing, as evidenced by the \nassault on the Hangzhou church. The mandarins in Beijing have always \nreserved special venom for groups they label xie jiao, or evil cults. \nThe most famous is the brutally suppressed Falun Gong movement, but \nthe authorities may be tempted to extend that label to the Christian \nsects that are growing the fastest--those practicing fervid forms of \nworship that stress miracles and personal inspiration through prayer. \nA number of cultlike, pseudo-Christian offshoots have sprung up in \nthe Chinese countryside in recent years, apparently inspired by this \necstatic form of worship. Often spawned by the personal ambition of \ntheir leaders, these highly secretive groups usually espouse \nmillenarian views that make the authorities profoundly nervous. \nMembers of a sect called the Three Grades of Servants were convicted \nearlier this year in Heilongjiang province on 20 murder charges, \ninvolving attacks on its main rival, Eastern Lightning, a sect that \nrelies on kidnapping and beating to make converts. One of its central \naims is the overthrow of the \"Great Red Dragon,\" a thinly disguised \nreference to Beijing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Christians tend not to see themselves as revolutionaries, \nhouse churches have become one of China's few bulwarks against \ngovernment power. In Wenzhou, a city in coastal Zhejiang province \nknown among Chinese Christians as \"China's Jerusalem,\" 15% to 20% of \nthe population is Christian, a fact that gives the church leaders \nmuch greater authority in confronting local party officials. In 2002, \nfor example, a campaign of protests and appeals to Beijing led to the \nreversal of a city government decision to ban Sunday-school teaching. \nIn Hangzhou, local officials say the clash--about which TIME was the \nfirst to hear eyewitness accounts--stemmed from the church builders' \nlong-running defiance of government regulations. The county \ngovernment's statement contends that three alternative sites had been \noffered to the Christian community's representatives but were refused \nby church leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nChinese authorities insist that they are not hostile to religion as \nlong as it is practiced according to their rules. At officially \nsanctioned churches like St. Paul's in Nanjing, a near puritanical \nattention to order is maintained. There are rows of wooden pews, a \npulpit from which the sermon is preached, even a signboard on which \nhymn numbers are posted. The pastor of St. Paul's, Kan Renping, 38, \nsays his congregation has grown from a few hundred when he took over \nin 1994 to some 5,000 regular worshippers today. Many have to watch \nthe proceedings on remote TV from four satellite chapels in a nearby \nbuilding. Despite the growth, Kan isn't a proselytizer. \"Anyone is \nwelcome to come in and have a chat with me about religion,\" he says. \n\"But if people want to come in and talk politics, that we don't like. \nWe only want to concentrate on religion here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the long run, though, government attempts to circumscribe how \npeople practice their faith seem unlikely to succeed--and could well \nspark more unrest. It's telling that even in the face of such \ncrackdowns, some Chinese Christians say they are confident that they \nwill eventually win the freedom to practice their faith as they \nchoose. Brother Chow (not his real name) is one. He is every inch the \nmodel of the modern Chinese Christian, a preacher who doubles as a \nbusinessman. Despite his pressed jeans, polo shirt and fancy mobile \nphone, he professes to believe in a deep, ancient faith, one that he \nsays has carried many a Christian through persecution. \"Why don't I \nthink it will be a problem? Because as time goes on, the government \nwill get to know the Christian spirit and realize that God exists.\" \nHe smiles with the secret knowledge of a true believer. \"And then,\" \nhe says, \"they will become Christians too.\"\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Time Inc.

It was the \nhighest-level assassination of a woman in Afghanistan in the five \nyears since the Taliban were ousted from power.\u0014\n\u0014\nSafia Amajan, 65, had served as chief of the womens affairs \ndepartment in Kandahar Province for five years, working for womens \nrights and education and vocational training. A former teacher and \nhigh school principal, she was well known and much liked in Kandahar.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a very tragic loss, said Sonja Bachmann, a United Nations \npolitical officer who knew Ms. Amajan well. She did a good job, she \nworked in a very low-key way and worked hard to raise awareness about \nwomens issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nA spokesman claiming to speak for the Taliban claimed responsibility \nfor the killing in a telephone call, Reuters reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of women gathered at the citys main Shiite mosque, where \nMs. Amajans body lay wrapped in a white shroud decorated with golden \nKoranic script, to mourn her loss. There is no security for anyone \nnow in Kandahar, one woman said, sobbing through her veil.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Amajan was shot as she was walking from her house up a narrow \nstreet to the main road shortly after 7 a.m., said shopkeepers in the \narea.\u0014\n\u0014\nA gunman shot her four times with a pistol, said Muhammad Haidar, an \nofficial who worked in her office.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer nephew, Muhammad Asif, 45, said that no one reported seeing the \ngunmen. A carpenter was close to the scene and heard the shots and \nhe called people, he said. Her husband also heard the shooting, came \nout of their house and found her lying in the street, Mr. Asif said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police were looking for two men who escaped by motorcycle, said \nthe provincial governor, Asadullah Khaled, who went to the crime \nscene. The police found tracks of the motorcycle driving away from \nthe scene, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Amajan preferred to take a taxi or public transport, even though \nher office had cars and drivers, her nephew said. She wanted to keep \na low profile, he said. We wanted her to come and live with us in \ntown, but she used to say, If its Gods will, they will take me \nanywhere. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Haidar said that she had not received specific threats but that \neveryone in the office knew of the danger posed by the Taliban, who \nhave in the past attacked teachers and government officials. In \nanother recent high-level assassination, a suicide bomber killed the \ngovernor of Paktia Province.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut to gun down a woman in the street, in this strictly conservative \ntribal society, is rare and shocking to many, and it has reinforced \nthe fear in this southern city, which was once the Taliban spiritual \nheadquarters, at the continuing violence and growing Taliban threats. \nA United Nations official noted that five people were kidnapped \nSunday in the city.\u0014",

    "words": "Gerald Ford\u0014\n\u0014\nRichmond Times-Dispatch editorial\u0014\n\t\u0014\nDec 28, 2006\u0014\n\u0014\nTry to remember. The early- and mid-Seventies rated among the worst \nof times. The years 1973 and 1974 saw the U.S. withdraw from Vietnam \nnot with peace and honor but in humiliation (a former ally soon would \nfall); a stagnant economy; an energy crunch, including endless lines \nat gasoline stations; conflict across the globe; domestic division; \ncorruption in high places; a vice president revealed as a backroom \ncrook; a president who resigned to avoid impeachment and conviction \nfor high crimes and misdemeanors; widespread demoralization.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States desperately needed to recover its confidence and to \nregain a sense of decency.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn unlikely man stepped forward. Despite serving an unelected \npresidency that lasted less than three years, Gerald Ford earned his \ncountry's everlasting gratitude. He was not a great president \naccording to standards set by the likes of Washington and Lincoln, \nbut no finer individual ever occupied the White House. When the \nsuccessor to the disgraced Richard Nixon described himself as a \n\"Ford, not a Lincoln,\" a relieved citizenry understood the right man \nwas in the right place.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe falsely gained a reputation as something of an oaf, yet Ford was a \nthoughtful person. He assembled a strong staff and sought the advice \nof talented aides. His years provided few opportunities for the \nsweeping reforms that impress academics; the circumstances called for \nsteady navigation. Ford's success contributed to his electoral \nundoing. If conditions in 1976 had remained as turbulent as \nconditions in 1973, 1974, and 1975, voters would not have risked the \nelection of an untested former governor of Georgia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1976 campaign produced an additional share of irony. Jimmy Carter \ndrew attention to his religiosity; he wore his faith on his sleeve \nand displayed the pride associated with the professionally humble. \nFew Americans recognized the depth of Ford's faith. A devout \nEpsicopalian, Ford neither lectured others nor advertised his \nchurch-going. News stories about his final years reiterated one of \nhis more admirable traits. As his health declined, the wires \nreported, Ford and his wife Betty seldom ventured from their Rancho \nMirage domicile -- except to attend services at the local Episcopal \nChurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nFord's snub of Alexander Solzhenitsyn was his greatest mistake. Yet \nalthough his negotiations with the Soviets provoked ridicule from \nleft and right, he in fact pushed a process that despite starts and \nstops ultimately played a role in the Evil Empire's fall. It took \nanother -- i.e., Ronald Reagan -- to complete the work, but Ford \nhelped in laying the groundwork. The Helsinki Accords of 1975 \nbenefited the good guys.\u0014\n\u0014\nFord's most controversial move endures as his most courageous. His \npardon of Nixon sparked outrage, recrimination, and charges of \nconspiracy and done-deals. Ford acted in the nation's best interests. \nHis purpose was less to spare Nixon (who then cut a pathetic figure) \nbut to spare the country. Nixon's future dominated discourse; \nadolescents in the national press refused to let the issue go. When \nit was time to move on, Ford did. The pardon was one reason Democrats \nswept the so-called Watergate election of 1974, a landslide that sent \nto Washington the greatest collection of unworthies until the 1994 \nGOP sweep. The pardon of Nixon was one instance where the lonely \nleader was right and the public consensus wrong. Ford bore a \nformidable burden. History has granted him vindication.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, the nation mourns Gerald Ford, 38th president of the United \nStates, dead at 93.\u0014",

And maybe we \ndon't, but it's there anyway,and this is how we survive most of our \ndisasters.\u0014\n\u0014\nNOW, DON'T IMAGINE that grace will take care of everything. Even \nthough God forgives, our loved ones do not forget. Things stay sticky \nfor a while. Nor do second chances come cheaply, as we find when we \nconfess to those we have wronged. Grace comes at a tremendous price.\u0014\n\u0014\nIN MARRIAGE we do become \"one flesh,\" as Jesus said, we do surrender \nour separate selves to become one person, and this person has been \ngiven life by God. Before we kill it, we should think about the \nconsequences. Love is the basic power of the universe. We must not \ntreat it casually.\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN WE SET our minds on the needs of others, it's impossible for us \nto be divided, and even in our churches the wolf and lamb, the calf \nand the lion, can lie down together.

That's all it takes to \nprovide a meetinghouse of friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nHEAVEN, as other people have imagined it, does not hold a lot of \ncharms for me. I cringe at the thought of little cherubs strumming \nharps and ogling each other sexlessly, or walking around on streets \nof gold for an eternity.  We were made for love, and as pure souls \nfree of wasting bodies, with all the time in the world, maybe we \ncould really know and love each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHERE IS STILL ROOM enough for wild animals and people to coexist, \nbut there is no room for carelessness.\u0014\n\u0014\nMAYBE LOVE, which on earth is made precious by our mortality, finds \nits full worth in immortality.

    "words": "George Frideric Handel Musicians, Artists, and Writers\u0014\nComposer of Messiah\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He [Handel] would frequently declare the pleasure he felt in setting \nthe Scriptures to music, and how contemplating the many sublime \npassages in the Psalms had contributed to his edification.\"\u0014\n Sir John Hawkins\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1741 George Frideric Handel was a failure. Bankrupted, in great \nphysical pain, and the victim of plots to sabotage his career, the \nonce-great opera composer scheduled a \"farewell\" appearance in London \nin April. To the London elite, it looked like this \"German \nnincompoop,\" as he was once called, was through. That summer, \nhowever, he composed Messiah, which not only brought him back into \nthe spotlight, but is still deemed by some to be \"an epitome of \nChristian faith.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOpposition begins\u0014\nUnlike Handel's fellow countryman and contemporary Johann Bach (the \ntwo were born the same year but never met), Handel never had a \nmusical family. George's father was a practical \"surgeon-barber\" who \ndiscouraged his son's musical career at every turn. His son was to be \na lawyer. Indeed, George studied law until 1703, even though his \nfather (who finally allowed his son to take music lessons at age 9) \ndied when he was 11. By age 12, Handel was substituting for his organ \nteacher and had written his first composition.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter musical studies in Germany and Italy, Handel moved to England, \nwhere he stayed for the rest of his life and became a composer for \nthe Chapel Royal. His greatest passion was for the operaan ill-timed \npassion, for the form was quickly falling out of fashion in England. \nThe most popular work was the 1728 Beggar's Opera, which satirized \nthe form itself. Still, Handel continued to pen operas into the \n1740s, losing more and more money.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel's friends expressed concern that the concert hall was nearly \nempty. Never mind, he joked, an empty venue would mean great \nacoustics.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe didn't joke for long. In 1737 Handel's opera company went \nbankrupt, and he suffered what seems to be a mild stroke. But to make \nmatters worse, his latest musical fascinationthe oratorio (a \ncomposition for orchestra and voices telling a sacred story without \ncostumes, scenery, or dramatic action)was his most controversial \nyet. His first oratorio (actually, the first of its kind in English), \nEsther, was met with outrage by the church. A Bible story was being \ntold by \"common mummers,\" and even worse, the words of God were being \nspoken in the theater!\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What are we coming to when the will of Satan is imposed upon us in \nthis fashion?\" cried one minister. The bishop of London apparently \nagreed and prohibited the oratorio from being performed. When Handel \nproceeded anyway, and the royal family attended, it was met with \nsuccessbut the church was still angry.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1739 advertisements for Israel in Egypt were torn down by devout \nChristians, who also disrupted its performances. All of this angered \nthe devoutly Lutheran Handel. As his friend Sir John Hawkins \ncommented, \"Throughout his life, [he] manifested a deep sense of \nreligion. In conversation he would frequently declare the pleasure he \nfelt in setting the Scriptures to music, and how contemplating the \nmany sublime passages in the Psalms had contributed to his \nedification.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough irritatedand Handel was often irritated, earning a reputation \nfor prolific cursing in five languageshe dismissed the Puritans' \nconcerns. \"I have read my Bible very well,\" he said, \"and will choose \nfor myself.\" In fact, Handel maintained that he knew the Bible as \nwell as any bishop. Financially, however, it did him little good. \nOnce the composer for royalty, he was now threatened with debtor's \nprison.\u0014\n\u0014\nDelivered by Messiah\u0014\nDeeply depressed, Handel was visited by his friend Charles Jennens. \nThe wealthy, devout Anglican had written a libretto about the life of \nChrist and the work of redemption, with the text completely taken \nfrom the Bible. A fussy perfectionist, Jennens had written it to \nchallenge the deists who denied the divinity of Jesus. Would Handel \ncompose the music for it? he asked. Handel answered that he would, \nand estimated its completion in a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon thereafter, a group of Dublin charities approached Handel to \ncompose a work for a benefit performance. The money raised would help \nfree men from debtor's prison, and Handel would receive a generous \ncommission. Now with a text and a motivation, Handel began composing \nMessiah on August 22, 1741. Within six days, Part One was finished. \nIn nine more, Part Two. Six more and Part Three was done. It took him \nonly an additional two days to finish the orchestration. Handel \ncomposed like a man obsessed. He rarely left his room and rarely \ntouched his meals. But in 24 days he had composed 260 pagesan \nimmense physical feat.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he finished writing what would become known as the Hallelujah \nChorus, he said, \"I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the \ngreat God himself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the performance of the piece again caused controversy \n(Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels and then the dean of \nSaint Patrick's Cathedral, was outraged and initially refused to \nallow his musicians to participate), the premiere on April 13, 1742, \nat the Fishamble Street Musick Hall was a sensation. An overcapacity \ncrowd of 700 people attended, raising 400 pounds to release 142 men \nfrom prison. (The demand for tickets was so great that men were asked \nnot to wear their swords and women asked not to wear hoops in their \nskirts, allowing 100 extra people into the audience. Such hoops \nimmediately fell out of fashion for concerts.)\u0014\n\u0014\nStill it took nearly a year for Messiah to be invited to London. \nReligious controversy surrounded it there, too, and Handel \ncompromised a bit by dropping the \"blasphemous\" title from handbills. \nIt was instead called \"A New Sacred Oratorio.\" But the controversy \nwasn't strong enough to keep away the king, who stood instantly at \nthe opening notes of the Hallelujah Chorus(though some historians \nhave suggested it was because he was partially deaf and mistook it \nfor the national anthem) a tradition ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough it had met rave reviews in Dublin (\"the most finished piece of \nmusic\"), it was not very popular in London after its premiere. By \n1745 Handel was again playing to empty houses and nearing poverty. \nNot until his oratorio Judas Maccabeus, which was misunderstood by \nthe English as a veiled nationalistic anthem, did Handel (and with \nhim Messiah) reach the pinnacle of his career.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil his death, Handel conducted 30 performances of Messiah (none at \nChristmastime, for Handel deemed it a Lenten piece), only one of \nwhich was in a church, Bristol Cathedral. In that audience sat John \nWesley. \"I doubt if that congregation was ever so serious at a sermon \nas they were during this performance,\" he remarked.\u0014\n\u0014\nHandel died on the day before Easter 1759, hoping to \"meet his good \nGod, his sweet Lord and Savior, on the day of his Resurrection.\" A \nclose friend remarked, \"He died as he liveda good Christian, with a \ntrue sense of his duty to God and to man, and in perfect charity with \nall the world.\"\u0014",

And the women who have been carrying out the cutting, and who \nhave been revered by their communities for doing so, are beginning to \nlay down their knives.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Shuriye, an elderly mother of eight who is known far and wide in \nnortheastern Kenya for her expertise as a genital cutter, is one of \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen local members of Womankind Kenya, a grass-roots group opposing \nthe practice, visited Ms. Shuriye's hut outside Garissa two years \nago, she chased them off her property.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was something her mother had done before her. She started as an \napprentice while still an adolescent by holding down girls' legs for \nher mother to perform the rite, which opponents call genital \nmutilation. ''I thought my mother would curse me from the grave if I \ndidn't carry on the tradition,'' she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were tangible benefits as well. She had prestige in her \ncommunity and earned a good income, more than her husband did as a \ncamel herder before he died of tuberculosis.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said she had no use for those people who came around denouncing \nher way of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the opponents were a determined lot. They knew that Ms. Shuriye \nwas one of the longest-serving genital cutters around and that she \nheld sway over the community. If only she could be converted, they \nfigured, others would certainly follow.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Shuriye, a frail but feisty grandmother who wraps her head in \ncolorful scarves, was rather set in her ways. Again and again she \nrefused to hear their arguments.\u0014\n\u0014\n''It was so difficult to change her mind,'' said Sophia Abdi Noor, \nthe founder of Womankind Kenya, which works with the ethnic Somalis \nwho live in Kenya's rugged North Eastern Province and has attracted \nlocal supporters throughout the region. ''We knew she was respected, \nand we wanted her on our side.''\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the anti-cutting advocates tried a different tack. They \nshowed up with religious leaders. Ms. Shuriye, a religious Muslim, \ncould not chase them away. She sat down with some influential clerics \nin her community who had come to the realization that the tradition \nwas harmful, and not dictated by or consistent with the teachings of \nthe Koran.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe imams denounced the practice. They told her that the vagina was a \npart of the body, just as important in the eyes of God as an eye, a \nfinger or a limb. Cutting it, they argued in their long session \noutside her home, is a sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey went even further. They told Ms. Shuriye that her sins required \nher to compensate the girls she had maimed. Each of them was due 80 \ncamels, they said. Ms. Shuriye, prosperous by local standards but not \nthat prosperous, was shaken.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe sobbed. Then she prayed. Finally she pleaded with the imams for a \nway out of her impossible situation. They said the only way to avoid \npaying the compensation was to seek the forgiveness of each of the \ngirls she had cut.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is when Ms. Shuriye turned from a cutter to an active opponent. \nShe began making house calls on the girls who had gone under her \nknife. Many of them were women now. She explained her conversion and \npleaded for their forgiveness. She cried each time, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost offered their blessings. A few saw opportunity in Ms. Shuriye's \nsuffering and demanded the camels, which she did not have. And Ms. \nShuriye was able to persuade a small number of the women in her tiny \nvillage of Ijara to join the cause.\u0014",

That is how I perceived the world's tallest \nwoman, 7 feet 7 1/4 inches, from my vantage point as the tallest \nlittle girl in Delmar, N.Y. Ms. Allen, who died last week at the age \nof 53, appeared invincible in her photograph in the Guinness Book of \nWorld Records. I imagined her wearing a red cape all the time, \nprinted with the slogan, The weather up here is fabulous. She must \nhave been madly popular.\u0014\n \u0014\n But when I drove to Shelbyville, Ind., last year to interview her, I \nfound her alone in a claustrophobic convalescence-home room, made \nsmaller by her 8-foot-long bed. She lived down the road from her \nchildhood home, on $54 a month in discretionary income. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe greeted me with a hug and a joke: If you ever want the ceiling \npainted, put a hat on my head and tell me which way to walk. It was \na hypothetical joke. Her legs were too weak to hold her 400 pounds, \nand she had recently summoned the fire department to lift her into \nher bed after she had slid off it. She was fighting organ failure \ncaused by her gigantism. Excess growth hormone had wreaked havoc on \nher body. I'm the oldest giant that ever lived, she told me with \npride. All the women who held this record before me died quite \nyoung. \u0014\n\u0014\nSee  Word, \"My Documents: Giant Problem\" for full article\u0014",

    "words": "Giving Comfort\u0014\n\u0014\n         I have a set of lessons learned about how to console\u0014\n         those who have suffered a loss, based on my own\u0014\n         personal experience and observation over the years.\u0014\n         First, go to the funeral. Thirty years ago, Mayor\u0014\n         Richard Lee of New Haven, Connecticut, told me that he\u0014\n         always went to funerals. Its there that you see people, he\u0014\n         said, and that they see you. Its there that you mingle\u0014\n         with families, listen to them talk, and lend your full sup-\u0014\n         port. I had never heard that advice stated so explicitly,\u0014\n         but he was exactly right. Death opens an enormous hole\u0014\n         in the heart. A funeral service brings together those\u0014\n         who can help fill that hole.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Second, call or write your friend when someone close\u0014\n         to her or him has died. It is remarkable how few people\u0014\n         actually reach out in tough times. Perhaps they dont\u0014\n         know what to say; perhaps they think the person would\u0014\n         prefer to be left alone. It is better to try and be rejected\u0014\n         than to never try at all. Your friend can always resist the\u0014\n         effortnot answer the phone, not open the letter. But\u0014\n         it is hard to imagine anyone not appreciating it.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Third, never say You will get over it. People rarely do.\u0014\n          The death of a loved one rips us apart, shakes us up,\u0014\n         hurts terribly. So my fourth tip is to embrace the person\u0014\n         who suffers. I think of the kiss my mother would give me\u0014\n         when I would scrape my knee or cut my finger. Her act\u0014\n         of love was more healing than any antiseptic.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Make it clear in the letter or phone call to your friend\u0014\n         that she or he is wonderful. The outstretched arm, the\u0014\n         warm embrace, the freshly baked cookies, or the fragrant\u0014\n         flowers do not replace the life. Not by any means.\u0014\n         But they do say to the grieving friend, You are loved.\u0014\n         You are cherished.\u0014\n\u0014\n        --Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (daughter of Robert Kennedy)\u0014",

    "title": "GIFTS FOR HARD TIMES",
    "words": "Gifts for Hard Times \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I've learned as life has taken a turn for what most people think \nis the worst.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam J. Stuntz | posted 8/28/2009 \u0014\n\u0014\nSurvivors of some horrible plague or battle often find themselves \nwracked with guilt: Why did I live while so many died? Though I had \nno battle scars, I used to feel a similar sense of guilt. I married \nthe only woman I've ever loved. We have three terrific children. I \nhave a secure job that I love and that pays well. Sometimes I would \nask God: Why have you been so kind to me? Why have I gotten such an \neasy life?\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't ask those questions anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nA little over nine years ago, while driving home from a family \nvacation, my car got a flat tire. When I started to change it, \nsomething nasty happened at the base of my back. Ever since, my lower \nback and the top half of my right leg have hurt. After two \noperations, dozens of injections, physical therapy, psychotherapy, \nand thousands of pills, my back and right leg hurt every waking \nmoment, and most of those moments, they hurt a lot. Living with \nchronic pain is like having an alarm clock taped to your ear with the \nvolume turned upand you can't turn it down. You can't run from it; \nthe pain goes where you go and stays where you stay. Chronic pain is \nthe unwelcome guest who will not leave when the party is over.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few months after my back turned south, my family and I moved when I \naccepted a job at Harvard Law School. Our family began to unravel. \nOne of our children suffered a life-threatening disease, and my \nmarriage fell apart.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose crises faded with time but left deep scars. Early last year, in \nFebruary 2008, another piece of bad news struck me: Doctors found a \nlarge tumor in my colon; a month later, films turned up tumors in \nboth of my lungs. In the past year, I've had two cancer surgeries and \nsix months of intensive chemotherapy. I've been off chemo for a few \nmonths, but I'm still nauseous much of the time and exhausted most of \nthe time. Cancer kills, but cancer treatment takes a large bite out \nof one's pre-diseased life, as though one were dying in stages. Some \nof that stolen life returns when the treatment stops. But only some.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, my back and especially my right leg hurt as much as they ever \nhave, and the odds are overwhelming that they will hurt for as long \nas this life lasts. Cancer will very probably kill me within the next \ntwo years. I'm 50 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch stories are common, yet widely misunderstood. Two \nmisunderstandings are worth noting here. First, illness does not \nbeget virtue. Cancer and chronic pain make me sick; they don't make \nme good. I am who I was, only more diseased. Second, though I deserve \nevery bad thing that has ever happened to me, those things didn't \nhappen because I deserve them. Life in a fallen world is more \narbitrary than that. Plenty of people deserve better from life than I \ndo, but get much worse. Some deserve worse and get much better. \nSomething important follows: The question we are most prone to ask \nwhen hardship strikeswhy me?makes no sense. That question \npresupposes that pain, disease, and death are distributed according \nto moral merit. They aren't. We live in a world in which innocent \nchildren starve while moral monsters prosper. We may see justice in \nthe next life, but we see little of it in this one.\u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, God gives better and more surprising gifts to those \nliving in hard times.\u0014",

She was \npronounced dead half an hour later at Kings County Hospital Center, \nand the roof alarm was still ringing as police officers began \nknocking on doors to try to identify her, asking families whether \nthey were missing a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they reached Apartment 20R, on the fourth floor, the girls \nmother, Nefertiti Martin, had no idea her daughter was missing.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe put them to bed and she expected to wake up this morning and \nfind all four of her kids, said Kyrahs grandmother, Nadine Martin. \nShe said, Not my kids. She didnt realize one was missing until \nshe pulled the sheets off the bed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome tenants speculated that the door may have been left ajar, or \nsuggested that the wind may have helped blow it open. What is known \nis that Kyrah tripped a motion-sensor alarm that several neighbors \nreported hearing around 1 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police and Desmond Bain, the buildings superintendent, said that \nsecurity cameras at the building recorded what appear to be the last \nminutes of Kyrahs life, in which she walks alone out of the \napartment and heads to the roof. She was wearing blue jeans, blue \nsocks, a pink long-sleeve jersey and a pink T-shirt over it. The \ncameras did not record her fall, Mr. Bain said.\u0014",

For ten \nyears this couple labored faithfully in Bechuanaland (now called \nBotswana) without one ray of encouragement to brighten their way. \nThey could not report a single convert. Finally the directors of \ntheir mission board began to question the wisdom of continuing the \nwork. The thought of leaving their post, however, brought great grief \nto this devoted couple, for they felt sure that God was in their \nlabors, and that they would see people turn to Christ in due season.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey stayed; and for a year or two longer, darkness reigned. Then one \nday a friend in England sent word to the Moffats that he wanted to \nmail them a gift and asked what they would like. Trusting that in \ntime the Lord would bless their work, Mrs. Moffat replied, \"Send us a \ncommunion set; I am sure it will soon be needed.\" God honored that \ndear woman's faith. The Holy Spirit moved upon the hearts of the \nvillagers, and soon a little group of six converts was united to form \nthe first Christian church in that land. The communion set from \nEngland was delayed in the mail; but on the very day before the first \ncommemoration of the Lord's super in Bechuanaland, the set arrived.\u0014",

Randy \nwrites: \u0014\n\u0014\nThere we met Jim's older brother, Bert, and his wife Colleen. In \n1949, years before Jim went to Ecuador, they became missionaries to \nPeru. When we discussed their ministry, Bert smiled and said, \"I \ncan't wait to get back from furlough.\" Now in their eighties, they \nare in their sixtieth year as missionaries, joyfully reaching people \nfor Christ. Until that weekend I didn't know anything about them. \nBert and Colleen may enter eternity under the radar of the church at \nlarge, but not under God's .\u0014\n\u0014\nBert said something to me that day that I'll never forget: \"Jim and I \nboth served Christ, but differently. Jim was a great meteor, \nstreaking through the sky.\" Bert didn't go on to describe himself, \nbut I will. Unlike his brother Jim, Bert is a faint star that rises \nnight after night, faithfully crossing the same path in the sky to \nGod's glory. I believe Jim Elliot's reward is considerable, but it \nwouldn't surprise me to discover that Bert and Colleen's will be \ngreater still.\u0014\n\u0014\nRandy Alcorn, If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and \nEvil (Multnomah, 2009), p. 421; submitted by Van Morris, Mount \nWashington, Kentucky\u0014",

    "title": "GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER",
    "words": "During the Civil War, night raiders carried away a slave mother and \nher baby boy from the farm home of    Moses Carver, near Diamond \nGrove, Missouri. Tracking them down, Mr. Carver traded a race horse \nworth about $300 to get the baby back, who was critically ill with \nwhooping cough. Unfortunately, the mother had already been sold.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Returning the black baby to the farm, Mr. Carver and his \nwife reared him in their home. Because he was so truthful they named \nhim George Washington, plus their own family name of Carver. Today we \nremember George Washington Carver as one of the foremost agricultural \nscientists in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\n           George was a sickly boy, and Mrs. Carver taught him to \nwork in the garden and do other household chores. He became quite \nskilful at raising flowers, and sick neighbors could always count on \na bouquet from the little colored boy.\u0014\n\u0014\n           He lived in a woodshed and took in washings to pay his way \nthrough Simpson College in Iowa. On graduation,         he took a \nteaching job at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and set up a \nlaboratory. Here he became a genius at working with plants. He \ndeveloped 53 different products from the feathers of turkeys and \nbirds; 100 different ways to serve the tomato; 250_medicinal \nproperties of plants; and. 500 varieties of dyes from roots and stems \nof plants. For example, he rediscovered the royal blue tint which the \nEgyptians used centuries ago to paint the tombs of their kings. He \ndeveloped the formula from the red clay of Alabama.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In 1912, the boll weevil swept out of Mexico over the \nSouth, destroying cotton, the traditional one-crop economy. Carver \nfelt the South could be saved if some use could be found for such \nproducts as peanuts and sweet potatoes. Then farmers could diversify, \nand not depend entirely on one crop.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In the laboratory he prayed, God, what is a peanut, and \nwhy did you make it? And God told him 300 ways to use the peanut. \nSome of the by-products were milk, cereal, coffee, face cream, ink, \nsoap, salads, vinegar, butter, oil dyes, wood stains, paints, \nflavors, and shampoos. Now there was a market for the peanut, and \nmany farmers began raising them.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Carver refused to patent any of his findings, saying they \nwere for the good of all. When he lost several thousand dollars in a \nbank failure, he shrugged it off with, That's all right, I wasn't \nusing the money anyway!\u0014\n\u0014\n          From the time he was a sickly farm boy raising flowers in \nMissouri until he worked with peanuts and sweet    potatoes in \nAlabama, George Washington Carver was planting gardens. He was \nbringing color, and life, and health, and prosperity, and happiness \nto others. Had he lived by the law of the jungle he would never have \nshared a single rose with a sick neighbor, nor would he have \nunselfishly and patiently nurtured 300 by-products from the peanut \nand 100 by-products from the sweet potato, nor would he have taken \nthe red clay of Alabama and turned it into the royal Egyptian blue!\u0014\n\u0014\n          Each of usin his own waycan plant a few seeds of \nhappiness, water them with the tears of compassion, and nurture them \nwith the hands of love. And in so doing, we will be building a garden \ninstead of a jungle\u0014",

German pastor Herman Gruner preached, \"It \nis because of Hitler that Christ, God the helper and redeemer, has \nbecome effective among us.\" Gruner went on to preach, \"Hitler is the \nway of the Spirit and the will of God for the German people to enter \nthe Church of Christ.\" Messages similar to this were heard from the \npulpits throughout Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were some Christians who realized that Hitler was evil and the \npulpits were recognizing a false prophet. One of those who stood in \nopposition to Hitler was Protestant theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. \nHe, along with several others, established what became known as the \nConfessing Church. It was a church whose message denounced Nazi \npropaganda and condemned Nazi atrocities.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring these years Bonhoeffer traveled to the United States to study \nat Union Theological Seminary in New York City. As things became \nworse in Germany, he could have allowed the Atlantic Ocean to keep \nhim safely away from the Nazi persecutions. Instead, as a pastor, he \nknew his place was among his people. This is stated in a letter he \nwrote to his professor Reinhold Niebuhr, \"I made a mistake in coming \nto America. I must live through this difficult period in our national \nhistory with the Christian people of Germany. I will have no right to \nparticipate in the reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after \nthe war if I do not share the trials of this time with my people.\" \nBonhoeffer returned to Germany and became actively involved in the \nresistance movement. Because of this involvement he was arrested and \nexecuted on April 9, 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul in his letter to the church at Thessalonica warned the \ncongregation against false prophets who will misrepresent the message \nof Jesus. \"Don't let anyone deceive you,\" Paul emphatically wrote. \nPaul then encouraged the Christians to \"stand firm and hold to the \nteachings we passed on to you.\" As true as these words were in 51 AD \nto a church in Thessalonica, they were as true for a church in \nGermany in the 1930s. And if read carefully, they are true for our \nchurch this day.\u0014",

    "words": "November 17, 270 \u0014\n\u0014\nGregory Worked Wonders\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Gregory became bishop of Neocaesarea in the region of Pontus \n(modern Turkey) in the year 239, there were only seventeen \nChristians. When he died (which tradition says happened on this day, \nNovember 17, 270), there were only seventeen pagans. That \ntransformation was owing largely to his faithful efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut before Gregory could lead people to Christ, he needed to know Him \nhimself. Gregory was born into a prosperous pagan home and named \nTheodore (Gift of God). His parents expected him to become a lawyer. \nIt was to fulfill that expectation that he and his brother planned to \nattend the famous law school at Beirut (in modern Lebanon). Their \nbrother-in-law became an official in the government of Palestine, and \nbefore they headed off to law school, they escorted their sister to \nCaesarea so that she could rejoin her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that time, the famous Origen, a Christian theologian and scholar \ntaught in Caesarea. Out of curiosity, the boys went to hear him. \nImmediately they were hooked. Origen's charm, his virtuous life, his \nsincerity, and tactical skill with arguments, his cleverly timed \nbursts of temper and sharp arguments persuaded them that Christianity \nwas the truth. Both converted to the young faith. Law was forgotten \nfor the next seven years as they immersed themselves in Christian \ntheology and philosophy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point Theodore changed his name to Gregory. Although devoted \nto Christ, he still planned to practice law when he returned home. \nAll the same, Origen urged him to turn the reasoning of the Greeks to \naccount for Christianity and Gregory did hope to write a definitive \nwork proving Christianity the one true religion. He never \naccomplished this.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, the few Christians of his hometown persuaded him to became \ntheir bishop. Neocaesarea was prosperous, idolatrous, and wicked. But \nwith incurable optimism, Gregory exerted all of his talents in the \ntask of converting pagans. To attract them within reach of the \nChristian message, he arranged games on martyrs' days. God granted \nhim such gifts of healing that many people came to him to be cured \nand heard the gospel. If the legends are to be believed, he performed \nmany astonishing miracles. There must be some truth in these, because \nhe was known from the earliest times as Thaumaturgus, \"Wonder Worker.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGregory's one driving goal was evangelism which he saw as a joyful \nantidote to heathen despair. \"And if any one does not believe that \ndeath is abolished, that Hades is trodden under foot, that its chains \nare broken, that the tyrant is bound, let him look on the martyrs \ndeporting themselves in the presence of death, and taking up the \njubilant strain of the victory of Christ. O the marvel! Since the \nhour when Christ despoiled Hades, men have danced in triumph over \ndeath. 'O death, were is thy sting!

He was famed as the author of a realistic tale of \nprison existence, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, published \nin 1962. This was based upon his experiences in Stalin's prison \ncamps. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen One Day was accepted for publication, Solzhenitsyn offered up \nthis prayer:\u0014\n\u0014\nHow easy it is for me to live with you, Lord!\u0014\nHow easy for me to believe in you, \u0014\nWhen my spirit is lost, perplexed and cast down, \u0014\nWhen the sharpest can see no further than the night, \u0014\nAnd know not what on the morrow they must do\u0014\nYou give me a sure certainty\u0014\nThat you exist, that you are watching over me\u0014\nAnd will not permit the ways of righteousness to be closed to me. \u0014\nHere on the summit of earthly glory I look back astonished\u0014\nOn the road which through depths of despair has led me here. \u0014\nTo this point from which I can also reflect to men your radiance\u0014\nAnd all that I can still reflect - you shall grant to me. \u0014\nAnd what I shall fail you shall grant to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he won the Nobel, Solzhenitsyn found himself in exile. \nHe settled in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 28, 1973 a new book by the Nobel-winner \nappeared in the Paris book markets. This book, too, was about \nprison--a documentary of the horrors of the Gulag Archipelago, \nStalin's prison camps in central Asia, a system of inland \"islands\" \nwhich taken together would have been as big as the country of France.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrained as a mathematician, Solzhenitsyn found his fame as an author \ninstead. In 1945, while serving in the Russian army, he was arrested \nand sent to prison for criticizing Russian dictator Josef Stalin in a \nletter. While in prison he met Christians whose faith impressed him, \nand he came to appreciate the deepened understanding of truth which \ncomes through suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day came when he was able to say, \"Bless you, prison, for having \nbeen in my life.\" For in prison, he recognized what a spiritual \nmonster he had been. There he listened to his conscience; there he \nfound God. Prison made him firm.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in exile, Solzhenitsyn not only sought the spiritual renewal of \nhis native Russia, but he also lovingly rebuked the west for its \nmaterialism and growing moral decadence. He continued to publish \nliterary works which documented the moral injustices of the Communist \nstate and the terror under Lenin and Stalin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nNielsen, Niels C., jr.

While he was chaplain to King Charles \nII, the king asked him to house his mistress Nell Gwyn. \"Not for his \nkingdom!\" replied Ken. \"A woman of ill repute ought not to be endured \nin the house of a clergyman, and especially the King's Chaplain.\" Far \nfrom being angry, Charles respected Ken for this stand and made him \nbishop of Bath and Wells. At the king's death bed, Ken strove hard to \nbring the monarch to a proper sense of sin and judgment, but \nsucceeded only in getting him to ask the queen's forgiveness for his \nmarital infidelities.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, although Ken was loyal to King James II, he stood up to him, \nrefusing to sign a paper which would have helped restore Catholicism \nto England; as a consequence, he was imprisoned in the Tower of \nLondon on June 8, 1688, but a jury found him not guilty and he was \nfreed on June 30th.\u0014\n\u0014\nTired of Jame's attempts to restore Catholicism to England, \nParliament invited William and Mary to the English throne. Curiously, \nin the Netherlands, Ken had rebuked this third king for mistreatment \nof Mary. Now, because Ken had taken an oath of loyalty to James, he \nrefused to do the same for William, saying it would make a mockery of \nall such oaths. Consequently, he was relieved of his church position. \n(When Queen Anne came to the throne, she offered Bath and Wells back \nto Ken, but he turned it down because of his advanced years, so she \npensioned him.)\u0014\n\u0014\nKen lived a godly, charitable life, so much so that he would have had \nlittle to live on if friends had not intervened. Despite his holy \ncharacter, he was widely suspected of leanings toward Catholicism. \nHowever, he disproved this by his decisions, however much he \nappreciated certain forms derived from the Catholic past.\u0014\n\u0014\nA good singer, he accompanied himself on lute and wrote many hymns. \nThe most famous of these are his morning, evening and midnight hymns, \neach of which ends with the words of the doxology he wrote: \"Praise \nGod from Whom All Blessings Flow...\" One verse from his evening hymn \nreads: \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen in the night I sleepless lie, \u0014\nMy soul with heavenly thoughts supply; \u0014\nLet no ill dreams disturb my rest,\u0014\nNo powers of darkness me molest.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, March 19, 1711, Thomas Ken died at Frome, Selwood, \nEngland, after a \"fit of apoplexy.\" He prayed shortly before his \ndeath, \"then gently laying down his head breathed one sigh and was at \nrest.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the religious statements in his will were these: \"I commend my \nspirit into the hands of my Heavenly Father, and my body to the \nearth, in certain hope, through Jesus Christ my Redeemer, of a happy \nresurrection...I die in the holy catholic and apostolic faith, \nprofessed by the whole church before the division of East and West; \nmore particularly I die in the communion of the Church of England, as \nit stands distinguished from all papal and puritan innovations, and \nas it adheres to the doctrine of the cross.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier ChiNotes story.\u0014\nHaeussler, Armin.

    "title": "GUTENBERG'S FIRST BIBLE",
    "words": "March 22, 1457 \u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg's 1st Bible?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Gutenberg is one of the most famous men who ever lived, but we \nknow next to nothing about him. Although we can pinpoint the month \nand day of his death, we aren't sure of the year. All the same, if \nyou like to read books, you owe a debt to this extraordinary inventor.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg was the first person in history to actually print books \nfrom movable type. However, the idea may not have been his. A \nsilversmith named Waldvogel taught \"artificial writing\" at Avignon as \nearly as 1444, using steel alphabets and an iron-screw press. \nWaldvogel, however, does not seem to have overcome the obstacles \nwhich Gutenberg shrewdly mastered at great personal cost. This \nincluded developing an oil-based ink.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a goldsmith, Gutenberg had the technical training to accomplish \nthe project, and was able to fund his own early experiments. But \neventually he needed capital and that proved his downfall. He had to \ntake a partner-- Johann Fust of Mainz. Because of his excessive \nsecretiveness, his partner sued him. It is one of the great ironies \nof history that Gutenberg was unable to profit from his invention of \nprinting. His creditors foreclosed on him just when success was \nwithin his grasp. The man who more than anyone else brought about the \nprint revolution, answered in court like any other debtor. Fust was \nawarded most of Gutenberg's equipment and the stock of Latin Bibles \nhe had printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Gutenberg's few surviving Bibles are worth millions of \ndollars. And yet, we don't know for sure when his first Bible was \npublished. Some almanacs say it happened on this day, March 22, 1457. \nHowever, that date has difficulties, because copies already existed \nwhen Fust sued him in 1455.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg's Bible was in Latin, the language of the church. Today we \nare used to elegant and \"clean\" typefaces. He printed his text in the \nthick and elaborate Gothic style familiar to readers of Medieval \nmanuscripts. The Bible was in 3 volumes of 1,282 unnumbered pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he lost his lawsuit, Gutenberg continued to print. However, he \ndreamed of making his books as beautiful as the illuminated \nmanuscripts of the day and it just wasn't feasible at that time. \nPractical printers, who cared less about aesthetics, got more \nbusiness than Gutenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his old age, Gutenberg was very poor. Archbishop Adolf of Nassau \ntook pity on the old man and gave him an appointment at his court \nthat at least fed and clothed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "words": "\u0014\nGrover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837. He was the son of the \nReverend Richard Cleveland and he grew up in Buffalo, New York. \nGrover studied law and at age twenty-five he entered politics. In \n1881, he was elected mayor of Buffalo, in 1882 he became Governor of \nNew York, and on July 11, 1884, he became the Democratic nominee for \nPresident of the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 21, just ten days after winning the nomination, the Buffalo \nTelegraph newspaper revealed that Cleveland had fathered a son out of \nwedlock to a Mrs. Maria Halpin. Mrs. Halpin was an attractive widow \nand Cleveland's neighbor when he was mayor of Buffalo. \u0014\n\u0014\nQuickly newspapers and Cleveland's opponents labeled him as \"a \ndebauchee who would bring his harlots to the White House\". Mockers \nchanted, \"Ma, Ma, where's my pa? Gone to the White House, Ha, Ha, \nHa!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the attack on Cleveland backfired. Rather than deny the \nstory, Cleveland telegraphed his friends: \"Above all, tell the \ntruth,\" and Cleveland admitted that he had an affair, that he had \nfathered the child and he had provided for his son's care. His \nconfession helped defuse the issue, and Cleveland was elected \npresident.\u0014",

    "words": "Galileo's Teachings Accepted By The Roman Catholic Church\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1609, Galileo began experiments that led to the invention of the \ntelescope. Through his observation of the planets, he was convinced \nof the Copernican theory that \"the sun was the center of the solar \nsystem and the earth revolved around it.\" In 1616, Cardinal \nBellarmine summoned Galileo to Rome to answer for his teachings. His \nwork was declared heretical and \"expressly contrary to the Holy \nScriptures\". He was forbidden to teach any more that the sun was \ncentral, and that the earth revolves around it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1632 he published his \"Dialogue on the Two Principal Systems of \nthe World-Ptolemaic and Copernican\". For this he was brought to trial \nagain. He was condemned to prison, required to abjure his doctrines, \nand to recite once each week for three years the seven penitential \npsalms.\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo was torn between his faith in Christ and the observable facts \nhe saw. At last, he consented to recant. He put on sackcloth, got on \nhis knees, and swore on the gospels to renounce his teachings \nforever. Then, rising, he is said to have uttered, in an undertone, \nthat famous saying, \"E pur si mouve\" which means \"It moves, for all \nthat!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally in 1993, the Roman Catholic Church accepted Galileo's \nteachings.\u0014",

    "title": "GENDER DIFFERENCES: ALL IN THE BRAIN",
    "words": "Author Lane Wallace highlighted two new studies in The Atlantic, both \nof which offer new insights into the relationship between biology and \nworldview. In her first piece, Are Liberals and Conservatives \nHard-Wired to Disagree?, Wallace examines the work of cognitive \nneuroscientist Ryota Kanai. Kanai conducted MRI scans on 118 college \nstudents whose self-reported political views ranged from very \nliberal to very conservative. \" Kanais findings were rather \ncompelling:\u0014\n\u0014\nMany areas of the subjects' brains showed no difference based on \npolitical orientation. But the subjects classifying themselves as \n\"liberal\" had a higher volume of gray matter in the anterior \ncingulate cortex of their brains than study participants who \nclassified themselves as \"conservative.\" The anterior cingulate \ncortex is believed to play a role in helping people cope with and \nsort through uncertainty and conflicting information, as well as \naffecting their levels of emotional awareness and empathy. The \n\"conservative\" participants, on the other hand, had a higher volume \nof gray matter in the right amygdala region  which is thought to \nplay a big role in identifying and responding to threats.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a second article, Why Do Women See the World in Shades of Grey?, \nWallace details a British study that found women were more likely to \nreject absolute answers in favor of the somewhat.  Men, on the \nother hand, were far more likely to assert that the objects were \ncompletely in or out of a particular category. In short, the men saw \nthe world in black and white, whereas women saw more grey. \u0014\nOf particular note in the second study is the fortitude with which \nthe women responded. The female participants answers were not born \nout of indecision but were instead made in confidence. The women were \ndefinitively more comfortable with ambiguity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe questions fueling these studies are not new. For at least a \ncentury, psychologists have hypothesized about the connections \nbetween biology and cognitive style. In fact, long before psychology \nwas a formalized field, philosophers and theologians recognized the \ninherent, oft-intangible differences between men and women. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly in recent history has this research extended to neuroscience, a \nmeans by which scientists are literally able to observe the \nconnection between biology and cognition. Even so, this is a new \nfrontier with lots of unknowns, a point Wallace makes in both of her \narticles. Not only is the brain incredibly complex, scientists are \nstill discovering the extent to which the environment impacts brain \nformation. Perhaps men and women were socialized to respond \ndifferently. Or perhaps liberals and conservatives are hardwired from \nbirth. These two small studies cannot offer concrete clarity on \neither theory.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we still have much to learn about the brain, Wallace ends with \nan important point: All of us see the world through lenses. None of \nus has a completely objective view of reality or truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Its not enough to merely appreciate one another; we profoundly need \none another.\"\u0014",

    "title": "GOD OR MAN? ASKS NICEA COUNCIL",
    "words": "May 20, 325 \u0014\n\u0014\nGod or Man? Asks Nicea Council\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred and twelve bishops gathered. In the center of the room, \non a throne, lay the four gospels. The emperor himself, dressed in a \npurple gown and wearing a silver diadem, opened the council. It was \nhe who had called them together. \"I rejoice to see you here, yet I \nshould be more pleased to see unity and affection among you.\" The \nplace was Nicea. It was on this day, May 20, 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few days would be devoted primarily to one purpose: finding \na way to describe exactly who Jesus was. Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his controversial doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine \nwas alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more, some international, some regional. Those councils which \ncame after also grappled with issues of Christ's humanity and deity. \nWas he one person or two? Was he God while in his mother's womb? Did \nhe have just one will? Which books belong in the Bible? The seventh \necumenical church council was also held at Nicea.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "GOD IS NOT A CHRISTIAN -- DESMOND TUTU BOOK",
    "words": "God Is Not a Christian \u0014\nDesmond Tutu        06/ 1/11 \u0014\n \u0014\nThe following is excerpted from the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's new \nbook, '\\God Is Not A Christian: And Other Provocations.'\u0014\n\u0014\nThis talk also comes from a forum in Britain, where Tutu addressed \nleaders of different faiths during a mission to the city of \nBirmingham in 1989.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey tell the story of a drunk who crossed the street and accosted a \npedestrian, asking him, \"I shay, which ish the other shide of the \nshtreet?\" The pedestrian, somewhat nonplussed, replied, \"That side, \nof course!\" The drunk said, \"Shtrange. When I wash on that shide, \nthey shaid it wash thish shide.\" Where the other side of the street \nis depends on where we are. Our perspective differs with our context, \nthe things that have helped to form us; and religion is one of the \nmost potent of these formative influences, helping to determine how \nand what we apprehend of reality and how we operate in our own \nspecific context.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy first point seems overwhelmingly simple: that the accidents of \nbirth and geography determine to a very large extent to what faith we \nbelong. The chances are very great that if you were born in Pakistan \nyou are a Muslim, or a Hindu if you happened to be born in India, or \na Shintoist if it is Japan, and a Christian if you were born in \nItaly. I don't know what significant fact can be drawn from this -- \nperhaps that we should not succumb too easily to the temptation to \nexclusiveness and dogmatic claims to a monopoly of the truth of our \nparticular faith. You could so easily have been an adherent of the \nfaith that you are now denigrating, but for the fact that you were \nborn here rather than there.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy second point is this: not to insult the adherents of other faiths \nby suggesting, as sometimes has happened, that for instance when you \nare a Christian the adherents of other faiths are really Christians \nwithout knowing it. We must acknowledge them for who they are in all \ntheir integrity, with their conscientiously held beliefs; we must \nwelcome them and respect them as who they are and walk reverently on \nwhat is their holy ground, taking off our shoes, metaphorically and \nliterally. We must hold to our particular and peculiar beliefs \ntenaciously, not pretending that all religions are the same, for they \nare patently not the same. We must be ready to learn from one \nanother, not claiming that we alone possess all truth and that \nsomehow we have a corner on God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should in humility and joyfulness acknowledge that the \nsupernatural and divine reality we all worship in some form or other \ntranscends all our particular categories of thought and imagining, \nand that because the divine -- however named, however apprehended or \nconceived -- is infinite and we are forever finite, we shall never \ncomprehend the divine completely. So we should seek to share all \ninsights we can and be ready to learn, for instance, from the \ntechniques of the spiritual life that are available in religions \nother than our own. It is interesting that most religions have a \ntranscendent reference point, a mysterium tremendum, that comes to be \nknown by deigning to reveal itself, himself, herself, to humanity; \nthat the transcendent reality is compassionate and concerned; that \nhuman beings are creatures of this supreme, supra mundane reality in \nsome way, with a high destiny that hopes for an everlasting life \nlived in close association with the divine, either as absorbed \nwithout distinction between creature and creator, between the divine \nand human, or in a wonderful intimacy which still retains the \ndistinctions between these two orders of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we read the classics of the various religions in matters of \nprayer, meditation, and mysticism, we find substantial convergence, \nand that is something to rejoice at. We have enough that conspires to \nseparate us; let us celebrate that which unites us, that which we \nshare in common.\u0014",

    "title": "GROWING UP AMISH",
    "words": "Growing Up Amish by Ira Wagler \u0014\n\u0014\nI can honestly say this is a truly positive review! This book was a \ntrue joy to read, as is very interesting and captivating. It drew me \nin from the very first sentence. I could not put this book down but \nonly for the demands of life. \u0014\n\u0014\nIra, the author, was born into a very large Amish family of eleven \nchildren. His father is the editor of an Amish periodical that is \nsubscribed to by just about every Amish household that exists. It is \nquite amazing how this periodical came to be and still exists today, \nwhich is explained in the book. As Ira meets strangers and tells them \nhis name, he is recognized by other Amish people as his father's son \nby his last name alone by recognition of his father's name, and is \noften asked if he is `the writer's son'? This is how popular and a \ngood writer his father is. (Ira's fathers' talent for writing has \nrubbed off on his son, Ira, the author of this book, as you will see \nif you choose to read this author's wonderfully written, descriptive, \nand talented book.) It shows how dedicated his father is to living \nand believing the Amish lifestyle is the only way to live and the \nonly way of life. This creates a lot of tension between Ira and his \nfather. \u0014\n\u0014\nIra tells the story of his life as he is confiding his deepest, \ndarkest secrets in you. You feel like you are right there, sitting \nright next to him, listening to all his trials and tribulations of \nhis Amish life. You feel what he feels as he grows and experiences \nall that he does. Is the Amish way of life the life he wants to live? \u0014\n\u0014\nYou also learn the real, nitty-gritty rules of Amish life, things you \nwould not know unless you read this book. The rules all differ as to \nwhat is accepted and what is not accepted in many different ways; the \ndiffering communities, communities from county to county, from state \nto state. I was not aware these rules even existed the way they do. \nAgain, the many different ways/rules of doing things and living that \nare or are not accepted, right down to the type of buggy wheels the \nAmish were allowed to use and even the clothing they wore. I learned \nso much about the Amish in this Non-Fiction book than in any \nfictional book I've ever read. \u0014\n\u0014\nIra, being from a very large Amish family, pretty much had a normal \nchildhood, until the closer he got to the age of 16, when the \nchildren were then considered adults, and then Rumspringa comes for \nthese Amish kids. This is about the time when the young Amish youth, \nnow adults, start to experiment different ways of living and doing \nthings socially. Ira had been feeling uncomfortable and confused \nliving the Amish way of life. He did not know or feel as if `this' \nlife was for him. He had many questions about his Faith, and exactly \nwhat it meant to him. He went on many journeys seeking answers to his \nquestions several times. When he would come back home, he would try \nto readjust and live the Amish way again, but he just could not do it \nfor any length of time. Something was missing from his life; he felt \na void. One of the lengthier times he came back home he tried dating. \nHe was continually trying to find just what that void was. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did fill his void happened one day when he met a special man in \nanother Amish community. This opened up a new way of thinking about \nfaith for Ira \u0014\n\u0014\nThis book is quite a journey through Ira's Amish life. Where he goes, \nwhat he does, what he tries to do and where he ends up. To pass this \nbook up and not read it would truly be a great loss. I honestly \ncannot give this book enough praise. It's truly a must-read!\u0014",

    "words": "God and Lawn Care\u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n Frank, you know all about gardens and nature. What in the world is \ngoing on down there on the planet? What happened to the dandelions, \nviolets, milkweeds and stuff I started eons ago? I had a perfect \nno-maintenance garden plan. Those plants grow in any type of soil, \nwithstand drought and multiply with abandon. The nectar from the \nlong-lasting blossoms attracts butterflies, honey bees and flocks of \nsongbirds. I expected to see a vast garden of colors by now. But, all \nI see are these green rectangles. \u0014\n\u0014\n St. FRANCIS: \u0014\n It's the tribes that settled there, Lord. The Suburbanites. They \nstarted calling your flowers 'weeds' and went to great lengths to \nkill them and replace them with grass. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n Grass? But, it's so boring. It's not colorful. It doesn't attract \nbutterflies, birds and bees; only grubs and sod worms. It's sensitive \nto temperatures. Do these Suburbanites really want all that grass \ngrowing there? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n Apparently so, Lord. They go to great pains to grow it and keep it \ngreen. They begin each spring by fertilizing grass and poisoning any \nother plant that crops up in the lawn. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n The spring rains and warm weather probably make grass grow really \nfast. That must make the Suburbanites happy. \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it grows a little, they cut \nit-sometimes twice a week. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n They cut it? Do they then bale it like hay? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST.. FRANCIS: \u0014\n Not exactly, Lord. Most of them rake it up and put it in bags. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n They bag it? Why? Is it a cash crop ? Do they sell it? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n No, Sir, just the opposite. They pay to throw it away. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n Now, let me get this straight. They fertilize grass so it will grow. \nAnd, when it does grow, they cut it off and pay to throw it away? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n Yes, Sir. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back \non the rain and turn up the heat. That surely slows the growth and \nsaves them a lot of work. \u0014\n\u0014\n ST.. FRANCIS: \u0014\n You aren't going to believe this, Lord. When the grass stops growing \nso fast, they drag out hoses and pay more money to water it, so they \ncan continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it. \u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n What nonsense. At least they kept some of the trees. That was a \nsheer stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. The trees grow leaves \nin the spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer. In the \nautumn, they fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep \nmoisture in the soil and protect the trees and bushes. It's a natural \ncycle of life. \u0014\n\u0014\n ST.. FRANCIS: \u0014\n You better sit down, Lord. The Suburbanites have drawn a new circle. \nAs soon as the leaves fall, they rake them into great piles and pay \nto have them hauled away. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n No!? What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots in the \nwinter to keep the soil moist and loose? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n After throwing away the leaves, they go out and buy something which \nthey call mulch. They haul it home and spread it around in place of \nthe leaves.. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n And where do they get this mulch? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST. FRANCIS: \u0014\n They cut down trees and grind them up to make the mulch. \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n Enough! I don't want to think about this anymore.. St. Catherine, \nyou're in charge of the arts. What movie have you scheduled for us \ntonight? \u0014\n\u0014\n ST.. CATHERINE: \u0014\n ' Dumb and Dumber ', Lord. It's a story about.... \u0014\n\u0014\n GOD: \u0014\n Never mind, I think I just heard the whole story from St. Francis.\u0014",

    "title": "GREAT SOUL: GANDHI AND HIS STRUGGLE WITH INDIA--A REVIEW",
    "words": "This is a carefully researched, judicious and exceedingly well \nwritten interpretive biography of Gandhi. However, it is not a \nbiography in the usual sense- you need to be familiar with the broad \ncontours of Gandhi's political life and India's freedom struggle to \nappreciate this book- the author assumes quite a bit of knowledge. If \nyou didn't know anything about this period, you might be puzzled \nabout why Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were massacring each other in the \nlate 1930's to 1940's and various other issues. Joseph Lelyveld \nrarely stops to explain complex political issues/movements during \nthis time, he assumes you are already familiar with the material (as \nI was). Here are a few other points about this book. \u0014\n\u0014\n1) Before reading this book, I believed that Gandhi was a great man. \n(based on my study of his life, not just because he was a \nnational/global icon). I still do. In another book, an author \n(Patrick French) calls Gandhi \"the most influential political \ncampaigner of the 20th century\" - thats a quick but accurate \nassessment. Gandhi was also a moral leader. (The author will agree \nwith all this). But Gandhi also had significant political, personal \nand moral failings, so he was not a saint. Saints exist only in \napocryphal religious tales or in the imagination of weak men who are \nlooking for others to worship. In the real world, we are all human. \nJoseph Lelyveld doesn't want to dismiss or explain away Gandhi's \nflaws (as some hagiographers has done), nor does he intend to \nexaggerate them or take statements made by him out of context. He \nshows his quality as a researcher in how carefully he handles various \nepisodes of Gandhi's life and in the judicious manner he reaches his \nconclusions. There isn't the slightest hint of sensationalism, nor is \nthere any kind of personal or political agendas. Please note that the \nAmazon.com review of this book is needlessly negative, the author \ndoesn't set out to trash Gandhi or destroy his reputation - if you \nread the book, you will find that the author admires plenty of things \nabout Gandhi,(so the title of the book \"Great Soul\" is not ironical), \nbut he doesn't place Gandhi on a pedestal. Gandhi had his failings, \nas all of us do. \u0014\n\u0014\n2) In India, many people were angry about the book, because allegedly \nGandhi has been called \"racist and bisexual\" in this book! This is \nFALSE. However, the book is not banned in India, as one reviewer \nincorrectly stated. A British nationalist hack, Andrew Roberts was \n(very regrettably) allowed to review the book in the Wall Street \nJournal, which didn't help matters. Gandhi probably wasn't bisexual - \nand even if he was, would that reduce your respect for him, assuming \nyou aren't an anti-gay bigot yourself? On racism, Gandhi did have \nsome prejudices against black Africans and made very little attempt \nto know them intimately or make common cause with them in spite of \nhis two decade long stay in South Africa (with some exceptions). To \nme, it is not news that Gandhi initially had some of the same \nprejudices that many Indians or British people of his time had. \n(Thomas Jefferson doesn't stop being a great leader because he had \nslaves!). What is more important is that he was able to rise above \nthose prejudices, both in his personal life and as a leader to write \n\"If we look into the future, is it not a heritage we have to leave to \nposterity, that all the different races commingle and produce a \ncivilization that perhaps the world has not yet seen? There are \ndifferences and misunderstandings, but I do believe, in the words of \nthe sacred hymn- we shall know each other better when the mists have \nrolled away\".\u0014\n\u0014\n3) Gandhi didn't think of the freedom struggle just in terms of \ndriving out the British. He thought real freedom would also require a \nfight against the worst forms of caste discrimination, namely \nuntouchability. And he also repeatedly emphasized the importance of \nbridging the divide between Hindus and Muslims in India. His \ndifferent objectives created some contradictions in his political \nlife which he found difficult to handle. For example, to end British \ncolonialism, he had to unite all Indians against foreign rule - to \nend caste discrimination, he had to fight the Hindu upper caste \northodoxy- which will divide the Hindus. When he failed to condemn \nthe caste system in entirety, lower caste activists criticized him \nfor hypocrisy (they still do). We might say he had too many things on \nhis plate. And of course, he had plenty of eccentric views on things \nlike diet and sex! Another thing about Gandhi - as the many quotes in \nthis book will reveal and as the author himself says - he wrote great \nEnglish! \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n4) Hate the sin, not the sinner- how many of us can even try to do \nthat? Gandhi didn't merely try, he succeeded. He was adamant about \nthe need for Indian freedom fighters to be completely free of ANY \nanimosity towards the British. In fact, Gandhi even tried to convince \nBritish officials of his point of view by arguments and moral \npersuasion. When he was criticized by Hindu traditionalists defending \ncaste discrimination or by Muslim/Hindu religious fanatics, he often \ninvited them for long chats/discussions irrespective of how violent \nor virulent their opposition to him was. As a political leader, he \nestablished a model for non-violent political agitation that has \nsince been followed by countless others. (Of course, it can't work \nagainst Nazis or military dictatorships which don't care at all about \nthe rule of law). He was also pretty media-savvy in the way he \ndevised his political campaigns and the images he used (think of the \nsalt march) and he frquently managed to put the British on the \ndefensive. Above all, it is his fearlessness in the face of violent \nthreats that makes him a \"great soul\". \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n5) I think Lelyveld is a little too pessimistic about India's social \nor economic progress since independence. (He doesn't say this, but \nthis seems to be the case from some of his statements). I am not \nsaying he is wrong- its a matter of different perspectives. But there \nhas been impressive progress in many ways- both in fighting caste \ndiscrimination and in economic development/poverty alleviation. \nChistophe Jaffrelot- one of the top experts on Indian politics thinks \nthat the empowerment of the lower castes in Indian politics amounts \nto a \"silent revolution\". Think of the changes in Indian \nsociety/politics between 1900 and 2010. In very few countries have \nthis much change been accomplished without any large scale violence. \nPeople from the lowest caste have succeeded in becoming Vice \nChancellors of universities, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of \nIndia and there are dozens of very rich Indian businessmen who have a \nlower caste background. If he was alive today, Gandhi would be happy \nwith all the progress disadvantaged Indians have been able to make \nsince independence. However, many lower caste activists will agree \nwith the author that progress has been quite slow - even today 50% of \nthe lowest caste people are below the poverty line and we continue to \nhear horrendous tales of discrimination and violence from rural \nIndia. Of course, India being among the few developing countries \nwhich chose to become a democracy, the kind of social change where a \nleader imposes his vision on the rest of the society was not \npossible. India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru was a great modernizer, \nbut even he had to struggle for eight years to get some laws passed \nin India's parliament which would guarantee (roughly) equal rights \nfor women. The bills were introduced in 1951 and could only be passed \nby 1959. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOverall, I strongly recommend this book- this is a very thoughtful \nbiography of Gandhi, but to get a lot out of it, you have to have \nsome knowledge of Indian history/politics in the 20th century. I had \nread two biographies of Gandhi prior to this, but I still learnt a \nlot from this biography- the other biographies were good, but this \none is the best. There is no sentimentalism of any kind- only calm \nperceptive analysis.\u0014",

    "words": "George W. Truett, Texas and Southern Baptist Leader (1867 - 1944)\u0014\n\u0014\n1955 Oftentimes crises become life changing experiences. As we face \nthese challenges, we can find strength through God in our moments of \nweakness. In 1898, George W. Truett, pastor of First Baptist Church, \nDallas, Texas, was quail hunting with some friends, including J. C. \nArnold, the chief of police in Dallas. As the men returned from \nhunting one evening, Truett shifted his gun from one arm to the \nother. In the process, the gun accidentally discharged, and a load of \nbuckshot struck Arnold in the leg. Although the wound was not \nserious, Arnold died five days later as a result of complications. \nTruett was heartbroken, feeling that his carelessness had led to the \ndeath of a friend.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days after Arnold's death, Truett told his wife that he would \nnever preach again. After a sleepless week, Truett found himself \npacing the floor late on a Saturday night still grieving over the \nincident. When he finallyfell asleep, Truett dreamed that Jesus was \nstanding before him saying, \"Be not afraid. You are my man from now \non.\" Truett was never the same. On Sunday morning word spread quickly \nthat Truett would address the congregation. Neighboring churches, \nincluding Methodists and Presbyterians, dismissed their \nservicesworship with First Baptist. According to one eyewitness, when \nTruett rose to speak, \"His face was drawn, and his eyes were so sad. \nWhen he stood to preach, he remained silent for a long moment. You \ncould have heard a pin drop. When he began, somehow he sounded \ndifferent. His voice! I shall never forget his voice that morning, as \nwe heard for the first time the note of sadness and pathos which \nlater we came to know so well. It seemed to carry the burden of all \nthe grief in the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTruett was pastor of that church for another forty five years. During \nthose years no one could come to him with a greater sorrow than his \nown. Truett's ability to help people in trouble, as well as his power \nin the pulpit, was born out of tragedy. In his time of greatest \nsorrow he found the greatest strength. (2 Cor 1:3 7; 12:7 10)\u0014",

    "words": "God or Man? Asks Nicea Council\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n God or Man? Asks Nicea Council \u0014\n\u0014\nThree hundred and twelve bishops gathered. In the center of the room, \non a throne, lay the four gospels. The emperor himself, dressed in a \npurple gown and wearing a silver diadem, opened the council. It was \nhe who had called them together. \"I rejoice to see you here, yet I \nshould be more pleased to see unity and affection among you.\" The \nplace was Nicea. It was on this day, May 20, 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few days would be devoted primarily to one purpose: finding \na way to describe exactly who Jesus was. Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his controversial doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine \nwas alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more, some international, some regional. Those councils which \ncame after also grappled with issues of Christ's humanity and deity. \nWas he one person or two? Was he God while in his mother's womb? Did \nhe have just one will? Which books belong in the Bible? The seventh \necumenical church council was also held at Nicea.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Aland, Kurt.

    "words": "German Serial Killer Nurse\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials suspect that Niels Hgel may have killed as many as 300 \npatients while working at two clinics in northern Germany between \n2000 and 2005.\u0014\n\u0014\n           By Melissa Eddy     June 6, 2019    NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nOLDENBURG, Germany  The former nurses crimes were \nincomprehensible, a German judge told the court on Thursday, \nreaching his arms across the breadth of the bench as if to capture in \none gesture what he sensed his words had failed to define  the \nenormity of murdering 85 patients who had been placed in the care of \nthe nurse but instead had found death.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour guilt is so large that one cant explain it, the presiding \njudge, Sebastian Bhrmann, told the nurse, Niels Hge, in a courtroom \npacked with the relatives of the 100 patients whose deaths he was \ncharged with orchestrating. It is so large, you cant show it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Hgel is believed to be the most prolific serial killer in \npeacetime Germany, and perhaps the world. His trial in the 85 murders \nsought to provide a measure of comfort and answers to some of the \nvictims families, more than a decade after they died. His conviction \non Thursday was the third for the nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials suspect Mr. Hgel may have killed as many as 300 patients \nwhile working at two clinics in northern Germany between 2000 and \n2005. He was accused of administering overdoses of drugs that caused \ncardiac arrest so that he could try to revive patients heroically. \nHis colleagues called him Resuscitation Rambo.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Melissa Eddy\u0014\nMay 10, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nOLDENBURG, Germany  The new nurse arrived at the intensive-care unit \nof Delmenhorst hospital with a solid letter of reference, describing \nhim as someone who worked independently and conscientiously. In a \ncrisis, it said, he reacted with consideration and was technically \ncorrect.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt gave no indication that officials at his former hospital in \nOldenburg, Germany, had grown deeply suspicious about the number of \ndeaths while the nurse, Niels Hgel, was on duty. Or that they had \nbarred him from contact with patients and effectively pushed him out.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore long, similar suspicions arose at Delmenhorst. Within four \nmonths, a patient, Brigitte A., died under his care. Others, Hans S., \nChristoph K. and Josef Z., followed. All were identified with only a \nlast initial under German privacy laws.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Mr. Hgel, 42, is considered the most prolific serial killer \nin the history of peacetime Germany, and perhaps in the world. \nOfficials suspect that as many as 300 patients may have died by his \nhand over five years starting in 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, it took more than a decade for a full investigation by the \nauthorities, who exhumed over 130 bodies in Germany, Poland and \nTurkey as they struggled to define the scope of his crimes. Mr. Hgel \nhas admitted to killing 43 people, has not ruled out killing 52 \nothers and denied killing five.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of killings and the amount of time it took for suspicions \nsurrounding his actions to come to light have raised uncomfortable \nquestions for Germany, including whether the same deference to \nhierarchy and predilection for procedure that once facilitated \nNazi-era crimes allowed Mr. Hgel to kill uninterrupted for so long.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf it is possible that in Germany more than 300 deaths over 15 years \ncan be swept under the carpet, what else is possible? said Christian \nMarbach, whose grandfather was a victim of Mr. Hgel. What does it \ntake for people in Germany to stand up and pay attention?\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Marbach now speaks at nursing schools about the moral questions \nraised by Mr. Hgels case.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Frank Lauxtermann, the only former colleague who \ntestified openly about working alongside Mr. Hgel, A culture of \nlooking away and keeping your head down ultimately shielded the \nsuspect.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Hgel is serving a life sentence for murdering two patients and \nplaying a role in the killing of four others. The current trial is \nhis third since 2006.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time, he faces charges of killing 100 more patients  36 at the \nmain clinic in Oldenburg, a tidy city that prides itself on its \nuniversity and 17th-century palace, and 64 others after he \ntransferred to Delmenhorst, a suburb of Bremen, about 20 miles away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe presiding judge, Sebastian Bhrmann, has ordered eight of Mr. \nHgels former colleagues to be investigated on perjury because of \nsuspicion that they lied to the court or withheld evidence in the \ncurrent trial to cover up lapses.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelations of apparent negligence by the hospital authorities have \nalready led to other criminal investigations. Two doctors and two \nhead nurses from the Delmenhorst hospital were charged with \nmanslaughter. Mr. Hgel is expected to testify at their trial after \nthe court reaches a verdict in his case, expected in June.\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer colleagues from Mr. Hgels early days as a nurse said he had \nquickly made a name for himself as someone who could handle the \npressure of life-or-death situations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reality, prosecutors say, he created situations in which life and \ndeath rested in his own hands.\u0014",

The bid is \nthe highest price anyone has declared that he wants to pay for a \nsecurity at a given time; the asked is the lowest price anyone will \ntake at the same time. This is for Over the Counter stocks (OTC) only.\u0014\n \u0014\nBig Board - A popular term for the New York Stock Exchange.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlock - A large holding or transaction of stock--popularly considered \nto be 10.000 shares or more.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlue Chip -A company known nationally for the quality and wide \nacceptance of its products or services and for its ability to make \nmoney and pay dividends.\u0014\n\u0014\nBull -One who believes the market will rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nBull Market -An advancing market\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Stock - Securities which represent an ownership interest in a \u0014\ncorporation.  If the company has also issued preferred stock, both \ncommon and preferred have ownership rights. The preferred normally is \nlimited to a fixed dividend but has prior claim on dividends and, in \nthe event of liquidation, assets. Claims of both common and preferred \nstockholders are junior to claims of bondholders or other creditors \nof the company. Common stockholders assume the greater risk, but \ngenerally exercise the greater control and may gain the greater \nreward in the form of dividends and capital appreciation. The terms \ncommon stock and capital stock are often used interchangeably when \nthe company has no preferred stock.\u0014\n\u0014\nConglomerate - A Corporation that has diversified its operations \nusually by acquiring enterprises in widely varied industries.\u0014\n\u0014\nDebentures -A promissory note backed by the general, credit of a \ncompany and usually not secured by a mortgage or lien on any specific \nproperty.\u0014\n\u0014\nDiversification- Spreading investments among different companies in \ndifferent \u0014\nfields. Another type of diversification is also offered by the \nsecurities of many individual companies because of the wide range of \ntheir activities.\u0014\n \u0014\nDollar Cost Averaging - A system of buying securities at regular \nintervals with a \u0014\nfixed dollar amount. Under this system the investor buys by the \ndollars' worth rather than by the number of shares. If each \ninvestment is of \tthe same number of dollars, payments buy more when \nthe price is low and fewer when it rises. Thus temporary downswings \nin price benefit the investor if he continues periodic purchases in \nboth good times and bad and the price at which the shares are sold is \nmore than their average cost.\u0014",

Though many \napocalyptic scenarios depict a terrifying, destructive end, some are \nrather gentle, having to do with the enlightenment of the human race \nor the dawning of a New Age. This term is also used to refer to the \nBook of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nArmageddon \u0014\nThe final battle between the forces of good and evil, mentioned in \nRevelation 16:16. The word is a corruption of Har Megiddo, the Mount \nof Megiddo, near Tel Aviv, a place where many battles were fought \nages ago. Many wars have been deemed Armageddon by contemporaneous \ndoomsayers, including the English Civil War, Crimean War, World War I \nand the Gulf War.\u0014\n\u0014\nchiliasm \u0014\nThe doctrine of a thousand-year Earthly reign of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarth changes \u0014\nSudden, large-scale, catastrophic changes in the geography, \ngeological activity, rotation or climate of the Earth.

Gog is \ngenerally considered the leader of the nation Magog, but this is not \nalways the case. For many centuries Gog and Magog were considered to \nbe the Huns, Goths or Turks, but in modern-day fundamentalist pop \nculture they usually represent Russia.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat Week \u0014\nThe doctrine that the seven days of Creation correspond to seven \n1000-year periods of human history, and that Christ's thousand-year \nreign is to take place during the millennial Sabbath -- the seventh \nmillennium since the Creation. Also known as the millennial week, \n6-day or 6000-year theory.\u0014\n\u0014\nKali Yuga \u0014\n \u0014\nThe \"age of iron\"; the dark age of materialism and ignorance, \naccording to Hindu mythology. We are currently living in the Kali \nYuga, which, depending on the source, has a duration of anywhere \nbetween 1200 and 432,000 years.

It originally meant a world no longer \ndominated by two great superpowers, in which world peace would be \nenforced through international efforts, a very positive idea indeed. \nThe phrase was relatively unknown in popular culture until George \nBush used it during a speech to Congress on September 11, 1990. \nAlmost immediately, fundamentalists and conspiracy buffs latched onto \nthe phrase, twisting its meaning to represent an evil worldwide \nconspiracy to form a single body that will govern the world through \ndeception, an iron fist and possible Satanic influence. The phrase \nquickly replaced the \"One-World Government\", \"New Order\" and \n\"International Jewish Banking Conspiracy\" favored by conspiracy \nparanoiacs. Writings prior to 1990 that refer to a \"New World Order\" \nare rare indeed. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum as seen on the \ndollar bill actually means \"a new order of the ages,\" not \"New World \nOrder\" as some paranoiacs would have people think.\u0014\n\u0014\nParousia \u0014\n\u0014\nTechnical term for the Second Coming of Christ\u0014\n\u0014\npyramidology \u0014\nA pseudoscience that teaches that the Great Pyramid of Giza is a \ndivine revelation.

And \neven Jesus was wrong about the Temple being destroyed such that \n\"there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be \nthrown down.\" (Matthew 24:2) The Western Wall of the Temple is still \nintact to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nTEOTWAWKI \u0014\nCommonly used shorthand for \"the end of the world as we know it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTribulation \u0014\nA period, generally thought to be seven years, in which the \nAntichrist comes to power, and the world is destroyed by war, \ndisease, rampant crime, earthquakes, and other nastiness.

    "words": "Gentle Bilney Burned for Minor Difference\u0014\n\u0014\n The deaths of some martyrs are understandable. By their bravery and \nfirm disagreement with established authority, persecution seems \ninevitable. Not so the death of Thomas Bilney. Bilney was a meek man, \nvery scrupulous, tender minded. He posed no threat to anyone. His \ndoctrines differed hardly a whit from those of the authorities who \nput him to death. Two years after his death they were adopted in \nEngland. Bilney even considered Luther a heretic.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was ordained a priest in 1519. Like many others, he sought to win \nGod's approval by fasts, penance, masses, and vigils. He found that \nthese were powerless to relieve his conscience. Reading Erasmus on \nPaul, he felt \"a marvelous comfort and quietness, inasmuch as my \nbruised bones leapt for joy.\" His Bible shows that he saturated \nhimself in scripture thereafter, marking it up with notes and \nunderlining.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalvation was through Christ alone. Rites, rituals, works--he \ndeclared all mere emptiness unless done in Christ. His sweetness of \ncharacter and devotion to scripture soon won Hugh Latimer, John \nLambert, Matthew Parker and Robert Barnes to Christ. Freed from the \nneed to work to attain salvation, Bilney worked even harder. He slept \nseldom, ate little, prayed much, and obtained a license to preach \nthroughout the countryside. After he won Latimer to Christ, by \n\"confessing\" to him, the two became almost inseparable, visiting the \nlepers and prisoners of Cambridge. Latimer called him \"a simple good \nsoul not fit for this world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat got him into trouble was denunciation of the worship of relics \nand saints. Pilgrimages to Canterbury could do nothing for the soul, \nhe said. The idolatry of Christendom had kept the Jews from Christ. \nCardinal Wolsey became alarmed and had Bilney arrested. Confronted by \nthe weight of church authorities against him and dreading his fate, \nBilney recanted. He did not differ from the church over Eucharist, \nconfession, the mass or any substantial doctrine, only on specific \nemphases and on the matter of relics and pilgrimages. The church \nitself sometimes taught faith. After a year in prison Bilney was \nfreed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was, however, so scrupulous that he could scarcely bear to open \nthe scripture, feeling the whole Bible condemned his betrayal of his \nprinciples. Salvation is by faith, not works. Relics are helpless to \nsave. After two years of deep despondency, he began to preach again, \ngathering boldness and openly displaying a forbidden Bible \ntranslation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was seized and tried. He readily accepted confession and a final \nmass since he had never challenged those things. As a lapsed \n\"heretic\" the law allowed him to be burned and that was his fate. To \nprepare his mind for the ordeal he burnt his finger in a fire. \nCheerfully he went to his death. After he had urged a large crowd to \ngodliness and admitted error in preaching against fasts (which he had \nalways practiced), the fire was lit beneath him. He died cruelly on \nthis day, August 19, 1531 crying \"Jesus\" and \"I believe!\"\u0014",

(Patrick \nSeeger/dpa via AP)more +\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA German mother and her partner were convicted and jailed Tuesday for \nrepeatedly raping the woman's young son and selling him to pedophiles \non the internet, abusing him for more than two years in a case that \nhas horrified the country.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Freiburg state court in southwestern Germany convicted the couple \nof serious sexual abuse of children, 21 counts in his case and 19 in \nhers. They also were convicted of rape, human trafficking for the \npurpose of sexual exploitation, forced prostitution and producing \nchild pornography, among other offenses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 48-year-old woman, who has been identified only as Berrin T. in \nline with German privacy rules, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. \nHer partner, Christian L., was sentenced to 12 years. The court ruled \nthat the man, who had a previous conviction for child sex offenses, \nmust remain in preventive custody after serving his sentence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pair were convicted of repeatedly abusing and raping the boy, now \n10, and selling him to men on the darknet, an area of the internet \nthat can be visited only by using special software. Some of the abuse \nwas filmed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pair and six others were arrested last September. Several men \nhave already been convicted in separate trials.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe court said the pair met at a food bank in Staufen, near Freiburg, \nin late 2014. It said the mother was aware from the start of the \nman's pedophile tendencies and previous conviction.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the following months, the court said, the woman organized assaults \non a 2-year-old girl she occasionally looked after. In May 2015, the \ncouple started abusing the woman's son, with the man at first \noffering the child cash.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple allowed four other men to sexually abuse the boy  among \nthem a German soldier, a Swiss man and a Spaniard who admitted paying \nthe couple 10,000 euros ($11,560) to rape the boy multiple times and \nwas convicted in a separate trial Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother was often near the scene of the abuse by other men \"to \nexert a calming influence on her child,\" and in the case of one \nclient participated herself, the court said. The verdict was based on \nconfessions by the pair and the videos of the abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Tuesday's verdict, the couple was ordered to pay a total 30,000 \neuros ($34,650) in compensation to the boy and 12,500 euros to the \ngirl they abused previously.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLocal authorities have been accused of failing to protect the boy, \nwho now lives with a foster family.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials took the boy away from his mother in March last year \nfollowing vague indications from police that he might be at risk, but \na local court sent him back weeks later on condition that she not \nallow any contact between the child and her partner.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice started investigating after receiving an anonymous tip in 2017.\u0014",

    "words": "Speaker and author Bill Butterworth says that he was something of a \ndelinquent when he was in eighth grade.  In metal shop that year, he \nwaited until the last day of class to start a project even though he \nknew that his whole grade would depend on how well it turned out.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The simplest project he could come up with was a screwdriver.  He \nheated a steel rod, put it on the anvil, and smacked the red-hot \nmetal with a mallet.  He hit it too hard, however, and flattened it \nmore than he was supposed to.  There wasn't time to start over so he \nhad to turn it in like it was.  He thought it was the ugliest \nscrewdriver he'd ever seen and figured he would flunk the course.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The next day the shop teacher called Billy up to the front of the \nclass and began to make a speech that Billy thought was meant to be \nsarcastic until he said, \"Congratulations, Mr. Butterworth, you have \nwon the Outstanding Metal Shop Project of the Year Award for \nyour...chisel!\" Without missing a beat, Bill launched into a little \nacceptance speech in which he thanked all the guys in the class, \netc.  When somebody said, \"I thought it was a screwdriver,\" Bill \nquickly said, \"No, no, I'm sorry, we don't have time for any \ncomments.  Thank you very much.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Reflecting on the experience years later, Bill asks why God would \nallow things to turn out that way.  He concludes, \"God was teaching \nme the importance of learning to go with the flow.  I find that the \nmore I accept what is happening and try to learn from it, the more \nprogress I make.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Servant, Fall 1996.  Pages 10-11.]\u0014",

    "words": "John Wesley Powell had only one arm.  He was wounded in the Civil \nWar and had his arm amputated, but he didn't let that slow him down. \nPowell had a dream.  He wanted to take an expedition down the \nColorado River all the way through the Grand Canyon.  In those days, \nit was commonly believed that it couldn't be done.  One explorer even \nsaid it would NEVER be done--ever! These skeptics certainly had \nplenty of evidence on their side.  Several expeditions had tried, but \nnot one of them had survived.  No wonder people thought Powell was \ninsane.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Still, the one-armed explorer thought he could do it. So on May \n24, 1869, Powell and nine other men got into their four small boats \nand set off on their thousand-mile journey.  They faced numerous \nhazards along the way:  killer rapids by the hundreds, waterfalls, \nboulders the size of houses, and the loss of boats, food supplies, \nand instruments.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But 100 days later, two boats appeared carrying Powell and five \nmen.  People had given them up for lost weeks before.  They had \npractically starved and exposure had taken its toll, but they had \nmade it through!  What about the others?  One had gotten cold feet \nright away and turned back after only a few days.  The three others, \nwho had had a hard time getting along with Powell, left the party and \nclimbed out of the canyon but were ambushed by Indians and killed.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When John Wesley Powell got into the boat to begin this trek down \nthe Colorado, he knew it would be no pleasure cruise.  He expected to \nencounter problems.  It's the same with us--we've got to anticipate \nthe ambushes we're likely to encounter.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Finishing Strong by Steve Farrar.  Multnomah, 1995.
