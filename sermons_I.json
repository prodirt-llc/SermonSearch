    "words": "Are we stuck always using the same bait?  Just because it worked in \nanother time and place does not mean it will work everywhere.\u0014\n The Lord Jesus commanded us to fish for men.  If we are to be \nsuccessful in doing that, we must find out what kind of \"bait\" will \nbe most effective in attracting men to the Gospel. A men's prayer \ngroup at a church in Ontario decided the best bait would be to meet \nthe felt needs of the men in their community.  They identified four \nelements which they thought would attract men to an outreach event:  \nfriendship, a high quality presentation, good food, and sports.\u0014\n   They began having a bimonthly dinner, using the same format as a \nbusinessmen's seminar.  In order to get Christian men together with \nnon-Christian men in a non-threatening setting, they reserve a \nprivate room at a local restaurant.  In order to attend, each man \nfrom the church is required to bring a lost friend, neighbor, or \nco-worker. (Those who want to attend without bringing someone were \nreminded that the purpose of the meeting is outreach not \nfellowship.)  This guarantees that half the group will be men who \nneed to hear the Gospel.\u0014\n   After the meal, a master of ceremonies opens the meeting with \nseveral jokes to relax everyone and break the ice.  The main speaker \nis a Christian athlete, attorney, financial expert, or businessman \nwho makes a presentation about his area of expertise and weaves in a \npersonal testimony of how Christ has made a difference in his life.  \nIn the discussions and casual conversations afterwards the Christian \nmen find many opportunities to interact about the claims of Christ on \na personal level.  So far four men have become Christians.\u0014\n      \"If your bait working?\" by Chuck Gianotti. Interest, Jan 1991. \nPages 8-9.\u0014",

    "words": "\"Single fathers are now one of the fastest- growing segments of \nthe American population.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   At the beginning of the 1980s only 10% of single parents were \nmen.  By 1991, that percentage grew to 15% (or 1.2 million U.S. \nhouseholds).  A few are widowers (7.5%), some never married (25%), \nbut the majority are divorced (66%).  Almost one- third of the single \nfathers have custody of preschool children.\u0014\n   The increase in the number of single fathers can be partly \nattributed to the fact that many men today are taking a greater \ninterest in childrearing and are unwilling to give up that role even \nthough their marriage falls apart.  In the past the courts almost \nalways awarded custody to the mother especially if the children were \nyounger, but since more moms work outside the home these days, what's \nbest for the child is not so clear-cut.  More children of divorce \n(88%) live with their mothers, but fathers are increasingly likely to \nask for and gain custody.  One benefit of this trend lies in the fact \nthat noncustodial mothers tend to stay involved in their children's \nlives more often than noncustodial fathers do.\u0014\n   Single fathers encounter many problems ranging from the routine \ndomestic chores to legal bias. They often feel isolated because they \ndo not have the support system single mothers usually do. Some are \nridiculed for choosing to take on a role traditionally reserved for \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"It's not like Mr. Mom\" by Jean Seligman. Newsweek, Dec 14, \n1992.  Pages 70-73.

    "words": "We were born before television or VCR's, before penicillin, \u0014\n     before polio shots, before penicillin, interstate highways, \nplastic, contact lenses, Frisbees and the pill.\u0014\n     We were before radar, credit cards, split atoms, lazer beams and \nself-explanatory pens.  Before pantyhose, automatic dishwashers, \ncloths dryers, electric blankets, bali dated parking, home air \nconditioners and drip-dry clothes.\u0014\n     When we were born, the moon was only to look at, not walk on.  \u0014\n     We got married first and lived together later.  How quaint can \nyou be?\u0014\n     In our day, closets were for clothes, not coming out of.  Buns \nwere bread, not backsides and rabbits weren't automobiles.  Jeans \nwere overalls and designer Jeans were scheming girls named Jean (or \nJeanne).  A meaningful relationship meant playing nice with your \ncousins.\u0014\n     We thought fast food was what you ate during Lent and outer \nspace was the back rows of the neighborhood movie theater.\u0014\n      Back then,  if they said you were gay, they just meant you had \na happy disposition.\u0014\n      We were before house-husbands, gay rights, computer dating, \ndual careers and commuter marriages.  We were before day-care \ncenters, group therapy and nursing homes.  We came before FM radios, \ntape decks,\u0014\nelectric typewriters, artificial hearts and word processors.  The \nonly men who wore earrings were pirates.  If yogurt was around, it \nwas unflavored and tasted awful. For us, time-sharing meant \ntogetherness, \u0014\nnot condominiums.  A chip was a piece of wood, hardware meant a \nscrewdriver or a hammer and disadvantages wasn't even a word.\u0014\n     When we were young, 'Made in Japan' meant junk and 'making out' \nmeant how you did on your tests.  Pizzas, McDonalds and instant \ncoffee were unheard of.\u0014\n     We bought things in 5 and 10 cent stores that cost 5 and 10 \ncents. Ice cream cones were a nickel.  For that same nickel, you \ncould ride the streetcar, make a telephone call, buy a Coke or enough \nstamps to mail \u0014\none letter and two postcards.  A new Chevy coupe cost $600.00 but  \nwho could afford one?  And a pity  too, since gas was 11 cents a \ngallon.\u0014\n     Back then mail was delivered twice a day, cigarette smoking was \nfashionable, grass was mowed, coke was a soft drink and pot was \nsomething you cooked in.  Rock music was what you sang to the baby \nwhen it was \u0014\ntime for a nap, and aids were helpers in the bumfuzzled office.\u0014\n      In  our day, people weren't economically disadvantaged, they \nwere broke.  A shelter was a place to get in out of the weather, not \na tax dodge.\u0014\n      We knew there was a difference between the sexes, but we didn't \nknow you could switch if you weren't satisfied.  We made do with what \nwe had. \u0014\n       And we were the last generation to think a woman needed to \nhave a husband to have a baby.\u0014\n       But we survived.  So let's celebrate.\u0014",

Can I talk to her?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, I don't want you to say anything to her about it. I haven't told \nher\u0014\nyet. Believe me it hasn't been easy. I've agonized over it for several\u0014\ndays, and I've finally come to a decision. I have an appointment with \nthe\u0014\nlawyer the day after tomorrow.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dad, don't do anything rash. I'm going to take the first flight down.\u0014\nPromise me that you won't do anything until I get there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, all right, I promise. Next week is Passover. I'll hold off \nseeing\u0014\nthe lawyer until after the Seder. Call your sister in NJ and break \nthe news\u0014\nto her. I just can't bear to talk about it anymore.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA half hour later, Morris receives a call from his daughter who tells \nhim\u0014\nthat she and her brother were able to get tickets and that they and \nthe\u0014\nchildren will be arriving in Florida the day after tomorrow.  \"Benny \ntold\u0014\nme that you don't want to talk about it on the telephone, but promise \nme\u0014\nthat you won't do anything until we both get there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMorris promises. After hanging up from his daughter, Morris turns to \nhis\u0014\nwife and says, \"Well, it worked this time, but what are we going\u0014\nto do,  to get them to come down next year?\"\u0014",

An \nelderly doctor and his two sons worked for days aiding the stricken, \nbandaging wounds, and setting broken limbs. Their heroic work did not \ngo unnoticed. Financial backing was offered for a large hospital,. \nprovided the doctor. and his sons took charge. They agreed, founding \nin 1889 a clinic which soon attracted wide attention. For years from \nfifteen to twenty operations were performed daily. People came from \nall walks of. life to the 'Mayo Brothers' Clinic. When the tornado \nstruck, people reacted, \"God has forgotten!\" Yet blessing came out of \ndisaster, and today the prairie city is known around the world and \nhas brought blessing to uncounted millions. What seemed to be a time \nof anguish and travail resulted in unimaginable blessing and victory.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph, his father's favorite son with his coat of many colors, must \nhave thought the end of the world had come the day his brothers threw \nhim into the pit. Can you see him down in that old dry well, banging \non the sides and crying out, \"Has God forgotten me?\" As he begged his \nbrothers not to sell him to the Midianites, but to no avail, can you \nhear him exclaim, \"Can there be a God to let this happen to me?\" \nYears later when exalted to second ruler in Egypt, he was used to \nsave the lives of many, including his father and brothers. He said to \nhis brothers when reconciled to them some years later, \"You thought \nevil against me, but God meant it unto good.\" Heartache and \nmisfortune were followed by blessing and exultation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne spring, day on an apple farm in. Michigan, some men who had been \npruning an, orchard made. a great pile of branches about 100 yards \nfrom the farmer's barn. One morning the farmer saw a bird carrying to \nthat pile of prunnings materials for a nest. So he marked the spot \nwith a stick. At sundown, with the bird flying about and chirping \nwildly, the man reached into the pile and tore the nest apart. If the \nbird were thinking, she was saying to herself, \"How cruel this man \nis!\" Next day the man saw the bird again trying to build at another \nplace in the same pile. Again he marked it with a stick, and at night \nhe destroyed all the work that the bird had done. No doubt the bird's \nwild flutterings and chirpings were bird language for \"This evil man! \nHow terrible he is to destroy my nest!\" On the third day he noticed \nthat the bird was building in a rose bush near the house. He smiled \nand let the bird alone. The farmer had intended to burn the branch \npile, and he knew if the bird were allowed to build among the \nbranches, the nest and its little fledglings would have been \ndestroyed. So in great kindness he had torn the two earlier nest \napart.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the cross of Calvary we see that there are no accidents! As Jesus \nhung there, \"the just for the unjust,\" it looked as though there had \nbeen an accident; that God had made a mistake. But on the third day \nafter, when \"God raised him for our justification,\" all believers \nknew that \"the cross was for our good\" and so the previous Friday was \ncalled \"Good.\" Out of that seeming tragedy, Christ paid the eternal \nprice demanded by God for our sins. \"The Lord laid on him the \niniquity of us all.\"\u0014",

They have spent all of their lives with Bart Simpson.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen or twenty years from now, today's college freshmen will stand \naround the water cooler (if there still are water coolers), shaking \ntheir heads over the fact that the class of 2013 0r 2023 never has \nhad to go to the library to look something up, never has driven a car \nwithout an on-board satellite navigation system, and never has heard \nof O.J.

Deep in his heart there was a longing to someday be \nable to help people; to save people from the ravaging grasp of a \nfireGrowing up never changed his mindThen the big day arrived.  He \nwas accepted to one of the best fireman schools in the country.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAs graduation approached, he realized that the long-awaited moment \nwas within reach. It was then that one of his professors suggested \nhe travel to Europe and study under one of the greatest fireman \ntheorists of all timeOnce again graduation loomed before himIt was \nthen that he was offered a position to teach at one of the most \nrespected fireman's schools in the country.  He accepted.  And for \ntwenty-five years he taught with honors and received recognition \nworldwideHe died in 1975 and when they read his memoirs, they came \nacross a strange passage written while on his deathbed:  'I lie here \ntoday reviewing my life.  I still remember my dream, my passion to be \na fireman.  More than anything else I wanted to put out firesbut I \nrealized something today.  I have never in my  life put out a real \nfire. Never.'\" \u0014\n\t\u0014",

And that's it. End of discussion. Everyone is \nintimidated!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the other professors nodded knowingly. There seemed to be a \nconsensus that the fear of being judgmental has taken on epidemic \nproportions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs the call for civility just another way of spreading this epidemic? \nIf so, then I'm against civility. But I really don't think that this \nis what being civil is all about. Christian civility does not commit \nus to a relativistic perspective. Being civil doesn't mean that we \ncannot criticize what goes on around us. Civility doesn't require us \nto approve of what other people believe and do. It is one thing to \ninsist that other people have the right to express their basic \nconvictions; it is another thing to say that they are right in doing \nso. Civility requires us to live by the first of these principles. \nBut it does not commit us to the second formula.\u0014\n\u0014\n To say that all beliefs and values deserve to be treated as if they \nwere on a par is to endorse relativism -- a perspective that is \nincompatible with Christian faith and practice. Christian civility \ndoes not mean refusing to make judgments about what is good and true. \nFor one thing, it really isn't possible to be completely \nnonjudgmental. Even telling someone else that she is being judgmental \nis a rather judgmental thing to do!\u0014\n\u0014\nUncommon Decency, Richard J. Mouw, Page 20-21\u0014",

    "words": "Edith called me (9/98) and asked if I would come over to her \nhouse; she wanted to talk with me.  When I arrived, we went into the \nden where her husband was seated and sat down.  Immediately she said, \n\"He's dying, pointing to her husband, and we're wondering if you \nwould have his funeral?\"  After taking a deep breath, I said, \"I will \ncertainly do whatever I can.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      He died 8/27/99 ( a FRIDAY) after a short stay at a hospice.  I \ncontacted her ON SATURDAY to check about the funeral, of course. I \ntold her I would be out of town on Sunday and could not get ready for \na service on Monday and suggested Tuesday or whatever suited her.  \nShe said, \"Well, whatever you want.\" I said, \"No, it's what you would \nlike. Just tell me.\"  She said, \"Oh, it doesn't matter to me.  I was \nthinking maybe Saturday or Saturday week.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     I said, \"Oh, no!  You can't keep the body out that long.\"  She \nsaid, \"Well, we're gonna--what do you call it when you burn 'em?  \u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Cremation?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Yeah! That's what we're gonna do. It costs so much to do a \nregular one, and there's no need for it.  Besides that, he loved the \nNavy and probably would have loved to be buried at sea -- in the \nocean. So that's what we're gonna do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     I set a time (Tuesday) to go by and talk with her and ask the \nfifteen questions I usually ask in preparation for the message.  One \nof those is, \"What do you think he would like to teach the next \ngeneration?\"  She said, \"Oh, he wasn't a teacher.  He had very little \neducation himself....\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Okay,  moving right along.  \"What are your most precious \nmemories of him?\"  She sat there for a minute and finally said, \"Give \nme a clue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"About what?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"About what you want,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n     I explained that I didn't \"want\" anything, just a response from \nher own heart.\"\u0014\n     She said, \"Well, I loved him.  I couldn't trust him, but I loved \nhim.\"\u0014\n     I asked, \"How can you love someone you can't trust?\"\u0014\n     She said, almost apologetically, \"Well, I didn't love him a lot!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Well, I dropped that conversation and tried to say a few words \njust before exiting.  I was GOING to say, \"I know you will miss him, \nand you should, but you have many loved ones who care about you and \nwill stand with you during these days.\" IN FACT, I said, \"I know \nyou'll miss him...\" when she broke in and  said, \"Yes, and I'm really \ngoing to miss his check.  His (SS check) was larger than mine.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Goodbye!\"\u0014",

It was\u0014\n                    during college he met a single mom who had two \nkids. Even though one\u0014\n                    of the children was blind, Warner didn't run for \nthe sidelines. He married\u0014\n                    the woman and adopted both kids.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Because he wasn't drafted by the NFL after \ncollege, he went to work\u0014\n                    stocking groceries. But he kept his dream alive \nplaying in the Arena\u0014\n                    Football League and eventually for the Amsterdam \nAdmirals in the\u0014\n                    European NFL. In 1998, he was signed by the St. \nLouis Rams but\u0014\n                    barely played. In 1999 his opportunities didn't \nlook much better. The\u0014\n                    Rams had hired quarterback Trent Green and gave \nhim a multimillion\u0014\n                    dollar contract. Kurt got the league minimum for \na second year player,\u0014\n                    $250,000.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    In a preseason game Green got hurt, which allowed \nWarner to prove\u0014\n                    himself as a starting quarterback. And prove \nhimself he did. Kurt Warner\u0014\n                    was named the NFL's most valuable player for \n1999. Only a handful of\u0014\n                    quarterbacks have thrown for as many touchdowns \nas he did this year.\u0014\n                    And of course, he was named the Most Valuable \nPlayer of the\u0014\n                    Superbowl.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    In spite of all this, Kurt Warner has an uncanny \nability to keep his\u0014\n                    storybook success in perspective.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    On October 15, 1999 on the stage of the Billy \nGraham crusade, (which\u0014\n                    was held at the TWA Dome where the Rams play \ntheir home games),\u0014\n                    Warner announced to over 40,000 cheering fans: \nWho am I? I am a\u0014\n                    devout Christian man. I am not a football player. \nThat is what I do. When\u0014\n                    I throw a touchdown pass now, my thoughts are on \nhow can I use this\u0014\n                    success on the field as a platform to glorify and \npraise my Lord Jesus\u0014\n                    Christ. People often ask the secret of my success \nas a football player. It\u0014\n                    has nothing to do with how I work out in the \noff-season, or my diet. The\u0014\n                    secret of my success is simply Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Warner says his faith, as well as the hardships \nand tragedies his family\u0014\n                    has faced, has helped him understand what truly \nis important in life. In\u0014\n                    turn, this helps him on the football field, \nparticularly in pressure situations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    He said that any salary increase he receives in a \npossible\u0014\n                    contract-adjustment for 1999 will be donated to \nCamp Barnabas, a\u0014\n                    Christian retreat in Purdy, Missouri, for \nspecial-needs children and their\u0014\n                    siblings.\u0014",

The\u0014\nother remained in the village, made restitution for the stolen\u0014\nsheep, and became a caring friend and neighbor to the townspeople.\u0014\nHe lived out his life in the village--an old man loved by all.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day a stranger came to town and inquired about the ST on the\u0014\nold man's forehead. \"I'm not sure what it means,\" another told\u0014\nhim. \"It happened so long ago, but I think the letters must stand\u0014\nfor saint.\"\u0014",

    "title": "IS GOD A FATHER OR A FRANKENSTEIN?",
    "words": "By Roger McDonald\u0014\n\u0014\nJustice cries hell, but the love and mercy of the Father leads me \nby faith to Calvary, and Calvary cries pardon and redemption. God \nis no monster fashioned in the laboratory of man's frustration. God \nis not the champion of man's passion for the law of eye for eye and \ntooth for tooth. He is no hard-faced tyrant wielding a sword of \nvengeance who sends us to hell when we do not toe the mark. No \nrevelation of God is true to God's revelation of himself in Christ \nJesus that does not rest on the historic fact that God so loved the \nworld, that he gave his only Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll that has preceded is not intended as a calculation that hell or \njudgment is inconsequential but is intended rather to serve as a \ncatalyst toward a proper presentation and understanding of its \ntheological significance. It is intended to say that God is not the \nservant of man's sadistic nature that fashions a hell of fire much as \nHitler fashioned Buchenwald. J. S. Whale in Christian Doctrine \nexpresses with poignancy the thought of the moment:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is illogical to tell men that they must do the will of God and \naccept his gospel of grace, if you also tell them that the obligation \nhas no eternal significance, and that nothing ultimately depends on \nit. The curious modern hearsay that everything is so frivolous that I \nwill not insult you by refuting it. 'I remember,' said Dr. Johnson on \none occasion, 'that my Maker has said that he will place the sheep on \nhis right hand and the goats on his left.' That is a solemn truth \nwhich only the empty-headed and empty-hearted will neglect. It \nstrikes at the very roots of life and destiny.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is eternal truth, and it is further accentuated by Leslie D. \nWeatherhead in When the Lamp Flickers: Let us never forget that \nthough the idea of hell was caricatured in a fantastic vulgarity by \nthe generation of our great grandfathers, we are doing our own \ngeneration a greater disservice if we are making light of sin and \npretending that it does not matter, that we are 'all going to the \nsame place,' and that God will pat everyone on the head at last and \nsay: There, there, it doesn't matter. I'm sure you didn't mean it. \nGo and enjoy yourself!'  When we survey the cross from which the \nMaster poured out his life in sacrifice, we know that such an \nattitude on the part of man and God is impossible because it makes \nlight of the holiness of God and the unholiness of man. Man with all \nof his theological and philosophical sophistication cannot water down \nJohn 3:16 to read, For God so loved the world that he gave his only \nSon that whether a man believes or not he will not perish.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian theology goes inevitably to Jesus the Lord for its teaching \nconcerning hell. It was his infinite heart of compassion and truth \nthat gave us word concepts like the place of weeping and gnashing of \nteeth, the fire where their worm dieth not, the shut door, and \nouter darkness. Jesus frequently used the word Gehenna to \ndescribe the awfulness of judgment. This referred to the valley \nHinnom outside Jerusalem where rubbish was burned continually. Here \nKing Manasseh had practiced child sacrifice to the god Molech while \ndrums drowned out dying screams. This place of horror with its stench \nof burning flesh, reverberating with the cries of hungry vultures, \nwas in the mind of the Son of God symbolic of the horror of man \nseparate from God. And do not fear those who kill the body but \ncannot kill the soul; rather fear him who cannot kill the soul; \nrather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. And if \nyour eye causes you to sin, pluck it out; it is better for you to \nenter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown \ninto hell, where their worm does not die and the fire is not \nquenched.' 'Now we cannot take as inconsequential what Jesus gave \nsuch meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inevitable question is asked, Is there room for judgment in the \ntheology of God's love? We must understand in answer to this that \njudgment is the logical outcome of the rejected love of God. Paul \nTillich in Systematic Theology stresses this when he wrote: The \nwrath of God is neither a divine affect alongside his love nor a \nmotive for action alongside providence; it is the emotional symbol \nfor the work of love which rejects and leaves to self-destruction \nwhat resists it. The experience of the wrath of God is the awareness \nof the self-destructive nature of evil, namely, of those acts and \nattitudes in which the finite creature keeps itself separated from \nthe ground of being and 'resists God's reuniting love. Such an \nexperieuce is real, and the meta\u0014\nphorical symbol 'the wrath of God' is unavoidable.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the holiness of God men are judged, for God is not the goodness \ninherent within man. God is not a ubiquitous force that apathetically \nproduced the universe. He is the personal God who reveals himself as \nholy love. It is against the patterns established from the creative \nactivity of this love that men break themselves into chaotic pieces. \nMan cannot violate God's pattern or moral intention and escape the \nconsequences. Men break themselves on the law of God and in so doing \nchoose their own direct route toward Gehenna. A man does not have to \nphysically die to know the agony of hell. Many a man cries in the \nflames of his own contrived hell while he yet lives. Many a man makes \nhis bed in hell by setting himself against God's system of things. \nFor man in personal rebellion against God walks a road that is paved \nwith hardness of heart, and its ultimate end is life's trash-pile.\u0014\n\u0014\nMan by his own volition can make himself useless in the building of \nGod's kind of world. But it need not be so. No man need take the leap \ninto darkness, and no man need remain there. The greatest picture of \nGod ever painted was in the red of sacrifice when Jesus Christ gave \nhimself without limit for the sins of all men. He gave himself that \nmaa might know the degree to which divine love is willing to go in \nthe ministry of endless reconciliation. Nothing short of the death of \nJesus could reveal the measure of\u0014\nGod's love.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur over-zealous evangelical firemen must come to the understanding \nthat a man cannot experience this redemptive love who wishes only to \nmake Christ Jesus his scapegoat. A man renders himself incapable of \nredeeming faith who sees in Jesus Christ merely a passport from some \nfuture kind of perdition. The Gospel is no legalistic contract which \nallows man to coerce God to fulfill the terms of some ironclad \nagreement.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn ancient legend tells of a woman who held in one hand a torch and \nin the other hand a bucket of water. What are these for? asked an \ninquisitive passerby. The woman replied, With this torch I am going \nto burn up the mansions in heaven and with this water I will quench \nthe fires of hell so that men will love God for his own sake and not \nfor want of the mansions and fear of the fire. Loving God for his \nown sake will put a man together again when all the king's horses and \nall the king's men cannot put themselves together again. Martin \nLuther prayed: Oh, my Lord! If I worship thee from fear of hell, \nburn me in hell; and if I worship thee from hope of paradise, exclude \nme thence; but if I worship thee for thine own sake, then withhold \nnot from me thine eternal beauty.\u0014\n\u0014\nMan can taste hell in the mess he makes of things, but ultimately it \nis the love of God the Father and not merely the fear of some future \nlimbo beyond death that lifts the level of life. Dedication to the \ndivine intention .and not fear of demons will lastingly change a man. \nThe leap of faith across the chasm of our little selves enables the \nsoul to find its home and not fear of the leap into the bottomless \npit to confront the devil and his angels.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn presenting the Gospel we must not forget and we must not allow men \nto forget that God loves us with an everlasting love. Martin \nNiehmoeller has written: It took me a long time to learn that God is \nnot the enemy of my enemies. He is not even the enemy of his \nenemies. Eternal love is a part of the unchanging character of God. \nThere is no substitute for the love of God as motivation for \nredemption. The love which was a burning glow from the heart of the \nSon of God caused, compelled, and created the scene of Calvary. At \nCalvary the paths of God and man cross, and man must come to grips \nwith God. Man must choose if the love of God is to be the love by \nwhich he lives his life. For in the final analysis the hell here or \nhereafter will be more a matter of taste than temperature.\u0014\n\u0014\nTill then we cast ourselves on the mercy of God, and we will not \nspeculate concerning the ultimate aim of divine redemption. We will \nonly respond to God's love as we are able to experience it now. But \nthis we know: Whether or not God will one day solve this paradox, \neither as loving Father transform into his likeness even the most \ndefiant of his enemies or as omnipotent Creator destroy these forms \nof life which are out of harmony with his new creation, he has not \nrevealed to us. Hell belongs with Satan and sin and death to that\u0014",

What we are supposed to do is place a few seeds \nin the soil of each pot and let them grow. God's sunlight and water \nwill do the rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nI also have several flowerpots here. I think we can use this first \none. It is all clean and pretty.\u0014\nI think we can use the next two as well. We will not be able to use \nthis fourth one, though. As you can see, it has some orange paint on \nthe outside of it.\u0014\nWhat? Did someone say that makes no difference? Are you going to tell \nme that I can grow God's blue flowers in a pot with orange marks on \nthe outside? How can that be? Of course! \u0014\n\u0014\nThe beauty of the flower depends on the seed, not on the color of the \npot.\u0014\nIf that is true, can I even use this pot with a little chip on the \nside of it? I can? You mean that God's seeds will grow even if the \npot is not perfect? Of course, they will.\u0014\nNow, all that seems a little silly, doesn't it? Yet, do you know that \nsometimes you and I tend to make that same kind of mistake about \npeople? We know that God puts his Spirit in all people, and that is \nwhat is important.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of looking for God's Spirit, however, we too often tend to \nlook at the outward appearance of a person. If he does not look \nexactly as we want him to, if he is a different color or does things \nin a different way, we think he ought to be set aside. Yet we know \nthat that is not true, is it?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe important thing is what is on the inside of a person. And what is \ninside is God's Spirit. Sometimes it is hard to see  like a seed \nunder the dirt in the flowerpot  but it is still there, and it is \nstill growing. Our job is to help it grow, not to criticize the \nthings that are not important.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the next few days, let's all try something special. Every time \nyou see a person, stop and remind yourself that God's Spirit is in \nhim, trying to grow. Then ask God what you can do to help him. It is \nlike watering the seed in the flowerpot. Remember, it is the Spirit \ninside that is important, not just what can be seen.\u0014",

In 1986, Kenneth B. \nHarris, a crack\u0014\n                               cocaine addict, had entered her \nsister's apartment,\u0014\n                               raped and strangled her, and then \nspent an hour\u0014\n                               drowning her in her bathtub. Now, he \nlay strapped to a\u0014\n                               gurney in a small, powder-blue room in \nthe state\u0014\n                               penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, his \nfeet lashed together\u0014\n                               and his muscular arms extended as if \non a crucifix.\u0014\n                               Haack stood against the viewing \nwindow, only 4 feet\u0014\n                               from Lisa's killer. As she watched \nHarris, she thought\u0014\n                               about her sister's death, and about \nHarris's family, who\u0014\n                               stood on the other side of a wall that \ndivided the\u0014\n                               viewing room in half. \u0014\n\u0014\n                               Harris showed no fear. He turned his \nhead to the side\u0014\n                               to smile and nod at his audience. With \nthe warden at his\u0014\n                               head and the prison chaplain at his \nfeet, Harris\u0014\n                               apologized to both families for the \npain he has caused\u0014\n                               them. Then he told the warden he was \nready to die. \u0014\n\u0014\n                               Vicki Haack wept quietly as Harris \nclosed his eyes and\u0014\n                               expelled his last breath in two loud \ngasps through\u0014\n                               trembling lips. She heard Harris's \nsister scream on the\u0014\n                               other side of the viewing roomed. Six \nminutes later,\u0014\n                               Harris was pronounced dead. After the \nexecution,\u0014\n                               Vicki Haack said that her family \nforgives Harris. ``We\u0014\n                               have no hate or bitterness in our \nhearts,'' she said. ``But\u0014\n                               that doesn't mean he does not pay for \nhis crime.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n                               Go on with life. It was something the \nmurderer himself\u0014\n                               said, though, that seemed to capture \nwhat so many\u0014\n                               family members hope to get out of an \nexecution. Just\u0014\n                               before his death, Harris turned to the \nfamily and said\u0014\n                               simply, ``I hope you can go on with \nyour lives and we\u0014\n                               can put an end to this.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n                               Putting an end to it--that's what so \nmany victims'\u0014\n                               families seek. Last week, a parade of \nwitnesses at the\u0014\n                               Timothy McVeigh trial expressed their \nhope that killing\u0014\n                               McVeigh would give meaning to their \nloss. And many\u0014\n                               survivors expressed their fury. ``The \nsooner [McVeigh]\u0014\n                               meets his maker, the sooner justice \nwill be served,''\u0014\n                               said Darlene Welch, whose 4-year-old \nneice, Ashley,\u0014\n                               was killed in the blast.\u0014",

    "words": "Is Suicide Unforgivable?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the biblical hope and comfort we can offer a suicide victim's \nfamily and friends?\u0014\n--name withheld\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Lewis B. Smedes | posted 7/6/00\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who ask this question seek biblical grounds for giving hope to \nthe kin of believers who take their own lives. The burden of proof, I \nshould think, lies not with those who offer the solace of grace but \nwith those who deny it. \u0014\nWill Jesus welcome home a believer who died at her own hands? I \nbelieve he will, tenderly and lovingly. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy biblical basis? It is the hope-giving promise of Romans 8:32, that \nneither life nor death can separate the believer from the love of God \nin Christ Jesus. \u0014\nHow can I trust in this promise and then deny its comfort to people \nwho doubly grieve for brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers who in \nhorrible moments of despair decided to end their lives? I believe \nthat Jesus died not only for the sins of us all but for all of our \nsins, including the forgotten ones, including suicide--if indeed he \nreckons it always as sin. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible does not seem to condemn suicide. There are, I think, six \naccounts of suicide in the Bible, the most notorious being those of \nKing Saul (1 Sam. 31:25) and Judas (Matt. 27:35). Others are \nAbimelech (Judg. 9:5054), Samson (Judg. 16:2331), Ahithophel (2 \nSam. 17:23), and Zimri (1 Kings 16:1520). As far as I can tell, none \nof the six is explicitly condemned for taking his life. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome say that suicide cannot be forgiven because the person who did \nit could not have repented of doing it. But all of us commit sins \nthat we are too spiritually cloddish to recognize for the sins they \nare. And we all die with sins not named and repented of. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a child, I heard compassionate people comfort the loved \nones of a suicide victim with the assurance that anyone who commits \nsuicide is insane at that moment. So, being mad, a suicide victim \nwould not be held accountable by God, despite the sin. But they were \nwrong of course. People of sound mind make rational decisions to end \ntheir lives. They choose to die rather than endure more pain than \nthey think they can bear, or to spare their loved ones the pain of \nwatching them die an ugly death. And rational people of good \nintentions sometimes help them do it. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut people who take their own lives are not usually cool and rational \nabout it. Nor do they mean to flout the will of God. Most of the \n500,000 people who attempt suicide every year in America do not so \nmuch choose death as stumble down into it from a steep slope of \ndespair. \u0014\nWe are told that every 17 minutes someone in America commits suicide. \nIn North America, suicide is the third-leading cause of death among \npeople 15 to 25 years old, college students for the great part. And \nnote this tragic feature of American life: among children between 5 \nand 14 years of age, suicide is the sixth most common cause of death. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuicide is also a significant threat to young people who have \ndiscovered that they have homosexual feelings. While there are no \nconclusive statistics on the phenomenon, some studies suggest a high \nrate of suicide attempts among young people with same-sex \nattractions. These are not people sticking their fists in the face of \nGod. These are children who look in their own faces and hate what \nthey see. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe heart asks, Why? But the answer is blowing in the wind. Young \npeople kill themselves mainly for one reason: they cannot believe \ntheir lives are precious enough to make them worth living. Despair, \ndepression, hopelessness, self-loathing-- these are the killers. \u0014\nI believe that, as Christians, we should worry less about whether \nChristians who have killed themselves go to heaven, and worry more \nabout how we can help people like them find hope and joy in living. \nOur most urgent problem is not the morality of suicide but the \nspiritual and mental despair that drags people down to it. \u0014\n\u0014\nLoved ones who have died at their own hands we can safely trust to \nour gracious God. Loved ones whose spirits are even now slipping so \nsilently toward death, these are our burden.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis B. Smedes is professor emeritus of theology and ethics at \nFuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.

    "title": "IS SATAN OMNIPRESENT?",
    "words": "Is Satan Omnipresent?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first principle  of sound demonology is that you cannot have a \nmore adequate idea of Satan than you have of God. That is because \nSatan is God's creature, and creatures must be understood in relation \nto their Creator.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday's Western world, having lost the knowledge of God, is currently \nin process of losing the knowledge of man and of Satan. Man is \nthought of as no more than a sort of ape, Satan is seen as no more \nthan a medieval bugaboo (i.e., a sick fancy), and temptation is \nreduced to conflict higher and lower natures (Freud's \"ego\" an \"id\"). \nWe need biblical clarity, and we must start our minds straight about \nGod himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow, biblically, should we think of God's omnipresence? The word \nmeans that God knows  exhaustively, and upholds and touches every \nsingle item in the universe from the tiniest genes and electrons to \nstars in the expanding universe to the most complex mind-body \ninteractions in the psyche of over 6 billion people. God is here, \nthere and everywhere, and his mind and hand are on everything. We are \nnever out of his sight (Ps. 139), cannot get away from him (John 1). \nWherever we are, he is there too. This is not simply a matter of \ntranscending spatial confines. Strictly speaking, God has no spatial \nlocation at all, for space belongs to the created order and exists in \nhim rather than he in it. Such is the omnipresence of God\u0014\n.\u0014\nWhat to think, then, of your enemy, the devil (1 Pet. 5:8)? Devil \nmeans slanderer, through malice and misrepresentation; Satan means \nadversary. He is called the evil one and an enemy (Matt. 13:19), a \nmurderer and the father of lies (John 8:44), who has been sinning \nfrom the beginning (1 John 3:8). He is an angel, one of the \nnonembodied personal creatures God made for the joy he and they would \nfind in their worship, fellowship, and service. (To that end, he also \nmade humans.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Satan is a rebel and corrupt. He leads the angels who, according \nto 2 Peter 2:4 andJude 67, are now under restraint in dungeons and \nchains and face the judgment of eternal fire for their sins (Matt. \n25:41). These fallen angels, whose character is set in the mold of \ntheir first transgression as later Adam's would be, are called demons \nin the New Testament. God restrains them to limit what they can do, \nbut their hostility toward God and the godly has no limits. Wrecking \nGod's work, thwarting his grace, and bringing us to spiritual ruin is \ntheir common goal with Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalled the tempter in 1 Thessalonians 3:5, Satan seeks to trap \nGod's servants into doing evil, thinking it to be good, and lapsing \ninto unbelief that makes obedience impossible and disobedience \ninevitable. Thus he assaults all Christians (Eph. 6:1113). Believers \nwalk into Satan's war with God and should not wonder when he turns \nhis fire on them. Satan tempts many people simultaneouslydoes that \nmean he is omnipresent? No. Omnipresence, as we saw, is unique to the \nCreator. Satan comes and goes (Matt. 4:3, 11;Job 1:712). So how does \nhe manage these multiple temptations? Scripture does not say, but two \ntheories are common.\u0014\nTheory one, recognizing that all angels have powers beyond ours to \nmove around and see into people, posits that Satan has the power of \nmultipresencenot omnipresence, but not as spacially limited as \nhumans.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheory two, surely the more natural, is that the New Testament \nwriters do what we do when speaking of warsthat is, ascribe all the \nhostile action to the opposing leader. Hitler (or Napoleon or \nSaddam) attacked, we say, when in fact subordinates acted at their \nleader's command. Most Christians, like C. S. Lewis in \"The Screwtape \nLetters,\" hold some form of this view, and have always done so.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither way, James's admonition, Resist the devil, and he will e from \nyou (4:7), explodes any idea of Satan's omnipresence promising \nmoments when he will not be with us. Jesus knew moments (Luke \n4:13)and so may we.\u0014",

    "title": "IS THERE A RULEBOOK ON FORCED TERMINATION?",
    "words": "Is There a Rulebook on Forced Termination?\u0014\nby Charles H. Chandler, Executive Director\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter facilitating a session of participants' stories at a Healthy \nTransitions Wellness Retreat, I was asked, Is there a rulebook on \nforced termination? He had observed the\u0014\nCHANDLER similar dynamics or rules in the stories. At every \nretreat the participants are amazed at the similarities in the forced \ntermination experience.\u0014\nSeveral years ago, the psychiatrist assisting with a retreat was \nappalled as he heard the stories. He worked extensively with \ncorporations in downsizing and noted that none of them treated \nemployees like the churches treated the retreat participants. He \nobserved three dynamic patterns in all of their stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, each minister had been blind-sided. A group of two or three \npersons, usually self-appointed, approached the minister without \nwarning and said he/she should resign because of loss of \neffectiveness. They convinced the minister that the whole church \nshared their feeling. The group presented themselves as merely \n''messengers and insisted there was nothing personal about the \nrequest. The messengers told the minister they loved him/her and \nreally hated to deliver the resignation request.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, while the minister was in a state of shock after being \nblindsided, the group dumped guilt on the minister. They said the \nresignation and related conversation must be kept very quiet. If word \ngot out, it could split the church. And, the minister would not want \nto be known as one who caused a split church! Any negative effect \nfrom the minister's leaving was dumped directly on him/her as though \na minister could just slip away and never be missed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, while the minister was still in no condition to make a \ndecision of any kind, the group pressed for a decision. In most \ncases, a few weeks or a few months of severance was offered  \nprovided the resignation was given immediately and the entire \nconversation kept quiet.\u0014\nThe messengers added, We have to know what you plan to do, because \nif you refuse to resign or if you talk to other church members, we \nwill take away the severance and call a church business meeting to \nfire you. Then you will get nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, the minister was told there was nothing personal about the \nrequest. They had to do what was best for the church. No reasons were \ngiven for the forced termination except that the church needed new, \nmore effective leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Now, I have worked with hundreds of ministers who have \nexperienced forced termination. At this point, I have decided a \nrulebook is floating around out there somewhere and it does suggest \nthat a few disgruntled church members can follow the above listed \nrules and kick the preacher out. I've never seen it in writing, but \nits effectiveness can be seen in case after case.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Look with me at some of the fallacies and undesirable ethics \nendorsed by this phantom rulebook.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Though the messengers present themselves as representing the \nvast majority of the membership, according to a survey conducted by \nLeadership magazine, 43 percent of forced-out ministers said a \nfaction pushed them out, and 71 percent of those stated that the \nfaction numbered 10 persons or less. The self-appointed \nmessengers often horde the inside information, because only 20 \npercent of the forced out ministers said the real reason for their \nleaving was made known to the entire congregation.  Frequently, the \ndecision is made by an\u0014\ninformal clique without authority. And, I am convinced the statement \ntelling the minister to remain quiet or risk loosing severance money \n) translates to, We do not have the votes to\u0014\nremove the minister via a church vote. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Ministers often remain quiet because they are afraid to take a \nchance on having nothing with which to house and feed their families. \nA the significant number of ministers have no\u0014\nsavings due to inadequate salaries. They often fall victim to the \ngroup's argument that\u0014\nremaining quiet is taking the high road. Remaining quiet also \ncreates dynamics that\u0014\nmake it easy for the church to become a repeat-offender church. The \nnext time a small but vocal group is dissatisfied with the minister, \nthe same old rulebook is consulted and another minister is forced \nout. Disclosing the secret may be painful, but it is the only way a \nchurch is able to stay or become healthy.\u0014\n\t\u0014\n      \tAs much consideration should be given to leaving a position as \nis given to accepting a position. Otherwise, the Lord's leadership \nhas little opportunity to guide the process. A minister does not owe \na self-appointed faction an on-the-spot answer. Time for prayer and \nprocessing with confidants or mentors is vital. Certainly, ministers \nhave the right to take adequate time for healthy decision-making.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The bottom line, as I see it, in dealing with the forced \ntermination process is clear-cut and well defined. Written or \nunwritten effective rules or dynamics are in place to force a \nminister out. However, this process is done in secret and without \nproper notification or concern. On the other hand, MTM offers \neffective procedures and professional guidance to help ministers and \nchurches move toward healthier decision-making. I know, without a \ndoubt, achieving the latter is worth the time and effort it requires.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinstering to Ministers Foundation, 2641 Cromwell Rd., Richmond, VA \n23225  804-320-6463\u0014\ne-mail:  mtmfoundation@aol.com\u0014\n David L.

She says Brother\u0014\nSmith was known for his elaborate object lessons.  One particular \nday, Sally\u0014\n walked  into class and knew they were in for another fun day.  On \nthe wall\u0014\nwas a big target and on a nearby table were many darts.   Brother \nSmith\u0014\ntold the students to draw a picture of someone that they disliked or\u0014\nsomeone who had made them angry . . .and he would allow them to throw \ndarts at\u0014\nthe person's picture.\u0014\n\u0014\n Sally's girlfriend (on her right), drew a picture of a girl who had\u0014\n stolen her boyfriend.  Another friend (on her left), drew a picture \nof his\u0014\nlittle brother.  Sally drew a picture of  Brother Smith, putting a \ngreat\u0014\ndeal of detail into her drawing.  Sally was pleased at the overall \neffect\u0014\nshe had achieved. The class lined up and began throwing darts, with \nmuch\u0014\nlaughter and  hilarity.  Some of the students threw their darts with \nsuch\u0014\nforce that their targets were ripping apart.  Sally looked forward to \nher turn,\u0014\nand was filled with disappointment when Brother Smith, because of time\u0014\nlimits, asked the students to return to their seats.\u0014\n\u0014\n As Sally sat thinking about how angry she was because she didn't have\u0014\n a chance to throw any darts at her target, Brother Smith began \nremoving\u0014\n the target from the wall.  Underneath the target was a picture of\u0014\n Jesus....\u0014\n\u0014\n A complete hush fell over the room as each student viewed the mangled\u0014\n picture of Jesus;  holes and jagged marks covered His face and His\u0014\n eyes were pierced out.\u0014\n\u0014\n Brother Smith said only these words, \"In as much as ye have done \u0014\nunto the least of these my children, ye have done it unto Me.\" \n(Matthew\u0014\n25:40)\u0014\n\u0014\n No other words were necessary; the tear-filled eyes of each student\u0014\n focused only on the picture of Christ.  The students remained in\u0014\n their seats even after the bell rang, then slowly left the \nclassroom, tears\u0014\n streaming down their faces.\u0014\n\u0014\n (author unknown)\u0014\n\u0014\n May the story above serve as a reminder that our attitude toward\u0014\nJesus Christ is demonstrated in the way we treat people around us.\u0014",

If I have \nthe gift of foretelling the future and hold in my mind not only all \nhuman knowledge but the very secrets of God, and if I also have that \nabsolute faith which can move mountains, but have no love, I amount \nto nothing at all.

It is not possessive: it is neither \nanxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own \nimportance.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage. It is \nnot touchy. It does not keep account of evil or gloat over the \nwickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good \nmen when truth prevails.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove knows no limit to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading \nof its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing \nthat still stands when all else has fallen.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor if there are prophecies they will be fulfilled and done with, if \nthere are tongues the need for them will disappear, if there is \nknowledge it will be swallowed up in truth. For our knowledge is \nalways incomplete and our prophecy is always incomplete, and when the \ncomplete comes, that is the end of the incomplete.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a little child I talked and felt and thought like a little \nchild.

I'm sorry.\" My tiny congregation\u0014\nstared back in shock.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1985, I'd moved to this promising community to start a church.\u0014\nI'd expected forty people at the inaugural worship service --\u0014\nfourteen showed up. Not until I decided to leave did our church\u0014\naverage forty in attendance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe low figure wasn't for lack of hard work. I didn't know as\u0014\nmuch as I'd thought I did, and ministry was much harder than I\u0014\nhad anticipated. So I quit.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, I've learned some powerful lessons -- ones I wish I'd\u0014\nknown before I quit.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN HOW MUCH PEOPLE LOVED ME\u0014\nI'd believed the primary reason for anyone to love me was for\u0014\nproducing results as a leader. The day I resigned I began to\u0014\nlearn how much people loved me for who I WAS, not what I DID.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN HOW MUCH I LOVED THEM\u0014\nAfter my resignation, the congregation met in our home to decide\u0014\nhow it would carry on. That night, I couldn't believe how much I\u0014\nloved these people. The same folks I'd been frustrated with --\u0014\nand blamed for my lack of success -- were ones I now grieved over\u0014\nlosing. The bonds of affection had been there all along; I\u0014\ndetected them only when I tried to break free\u0014\nfrom them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN HOW MUCH GOOD WAS HAPPENING\u0014\nThe week before I quit, I told my dad about my decision. He said,\u0014\n\"Pay attention to what happens. I think you'll notice much more\u0014\ngood is going on in your church than you would have imagined.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose were prophetic words. People stepped up to ministry as soon\u0014\nas I got out of their way. Folks came into a relationship with\u0014\nGod because of seeds planted during my ministry. People called\u0014\nand wrote letters expressing how much they had benefited from my\u0014\nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nI half-expected the church to fold. It didn't. Instead it\u0014\ncontinued to slowly grow. I wish I'd seen that my people were\u0014\nbeyond where I thought they were.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN THERE WERE ALTERNATIVES TO QUITTING\u0014\nI shared my decision with three men in my church a week before I\u0014\nquit. What I didn't do was listen to them. They brought up three\u0014\nalternatives I should have considered:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Take a leave of absence. Most churches really do love their\u0014\npastors, and would much prefer to work out a time of absence for\u0014\nhealing, rather than go through the divorce-and-remarriage\u0014\nprocess.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Talk with other pastors. They would have loved to help me. I\u0014\ndidn't ask.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Work maintenance into the weekly routine. Failure is inevitable\u0014\nin ministry, and dealing with failure demands not only a\u0014\nspiritual strategy, but a physical one as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING SHARP\u0014\nFor years, I thought I couldn't afford conferences and books. I\u0014\nnow know I can't afford to go without them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI WISH I'D KNOWN HOW MUCH INAPPROPRIATE PRIDE WAS INVOLVED\u0014\nPride prevented me from talking to others, from considering\u0014\noptions, or from taking time off. Pride kept me from saying, \"I\u0014\ndon't know what to do,\" as opposed to saying, \"I'm going to quit -\u0014\n- end of discussion!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI no longer ask if my resignation was a mistake. Instead I ask:\u0014\nHave I learned from that experience? When tempted to move, I ask:\u0014\nAm I committed to learn and grow, and not quit if at all\u0014\npossible? These lessons have been used by Christ to create a\u0014\ntighter bond to the ministry I now serve.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnthony Laird is pastor of East Tucson (Arizona) Baptist Church.\u0014",

I will try to\u0014\ndo the same.\u0014\n\u0014\n.We will never take for granted that we are doing well just because \nwe aren't talking about our loss. Let us agree to regularly check \nwith each other, discussing ways to be more supportive and nur turing.\u0014\n\u0014\n.We will celebrate the memory of our loved one on holidays and \nanniversaries. We will expect to feel a greater depth of sadness on \nthese days and we'll try to plan meaningful activities together. .\u0014\n\u0014\n.Disposing of personal items that belonged to the person we loved \nwill be done slowly, making every attempt to consider all of our \nfeelings.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Sometimes our sorrow will affect our family relationships in sur-- ~ \n-ptlsiIigofunpreasanr~.

The day William \nJefferson Clinton's many critics have been waiting for is here. The \nsun rose without him in the Oval Office this morning and you could \nalmost hear the shouts of Hallelujah from Wayne Newton and other \ncenters of moral salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Newton, the Las Vegas \nentertainer, praised the Lord at the opening of President Bush's \ninauguration ceremonies for freeing the nation of Clinton. The \njudgment of history is also in.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       That's right. Instant history \nhas weighed the Clinton administration as precisely as an assay of \nore and found him flawed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       ABC's marvelous \"Nightline\" \nseries on Clinton, starring a cast of tell-all former West Wing aides \nlike George Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris, was great theater that \nkept many of us up late during the last week. Those of us who watched \nClinton for eight years still shake our heads about it all.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But a lot of time will have to \npass before an administration this complex can be measured \naccurately, let alone viewed objectively. All the people who worked \nwith Clinton, loyal to the end or not, had their own personal prism \nto view him and they were simply too personally affected by what he \ndid to tell us very much useful.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      The entertaining notion was \nadvanced by ABC that a delegation of heavyweight Democratic senators \nled by Kent Conrad of North Dakota (you've heard of him) was close to \npaying a call on Clinton suggesting he should resign at the depth of \nthe impeachment controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      It may be convenient for some \npoliticians to teach it that way now that he's out of power. But at \nthe time of Clinton's impeachment and trial, his popularity was so \nhigh that Democrats could not do much more than grumble and curse \nunder their breaths as they voted for acquittal. Maybe some would \nhave liked to have gone to the White House. But they did not.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                     As Clinton repeatedly told the \nnation in his last hours, the budget was balanced and a surplus began \nto reduce the national debt on his watch. You can argue why. Was the \nbooming economy the result or the cause?\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    One question that hasn't been \nexplored very thoroughly is whether the administration's choices of \nthings to eliminate and cut back were the right ones.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                     At the Pentagon - which absorbed \na large share of the budget reductions after the Cold War in this \nadministration and its predecessors - the cuts were met with force \nreductions. People from both parties are saying now that was a \nterrible way to do it. But they weren't saying that at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    With the country basically at \npeace, reforms should have been attempted to put the Defense \nDepartment on a businesslike footing. But they were not.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    And the result is that the force \nstructure, facilities and weapons are too heavy, too old and \nexpensive, and there are too few divisions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    At the Pentagon and throughout \ngovernment, civilian personnel cutbacks were a big part of Clinton's \nsuccess in wrestling government spending to the ground. Few \nquestioned the wisdom of this, then or now. But the Internal Revenue \nService has been reduced to a shell of an enforcement agency in the \nClinton years, and the result is that no one is watching tax evaders \nvery closely.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                   Last week, Comptroller General \nDavid M. Walker, the government's top auditor, declared that the \ncutbacks had left government management weak and underskilled. Waste, \nfraud and abuse are going undetected.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Very little attention was paid by \nClinton's chorus of critics to these failings in governance. Instead \nthey spent his eight years investigating his sexual peccadilloes and \nsuspicions about corruption in the financial affair that came to be \nknown as Whitewater. In his last week in office, the Wall Street \nJournal editorial page - the most relentless of all the sleuths about \nClinton's personal conduct - said the president's legacy was the \n\"cheapening of our national life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  The public's verdict is more \nbipolar. The final polls on Clinton give him an astonishing 65 \npercent approval rating. And yet 67 percent say he is not honest or \ntrustworthy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  He was both things to the same \npeople right to the end and even instant historians or the guardians \nof the Pearly Gates may have trouble sorting it out.\u0014",

The measure is before the House of Delegates. \u0014\n\u0014\n   A Senate committee stopped short of recommending suspension of \nexecutions pending\u0014\n   a study of the policy. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Six states  Illinois, Nebraska, Arizona, North Carolina, Maryland \nand Indiana  have\u0014\n   launched capital punishment studies looking at issues ranging from \nthe quality of\u0014\n   defense lawyers to the overall functioning of the death penalty, \nsaid Paula Bernstein of\u0014\n   the Death Penalty Information Center. \u0014\n\u0014\n   In Illinois, Republican Gov. George Ryan imposed an indefinite \nmoratorium on\u0014\n   executions last year after several men were released from death \nrow because they had\u0014\n   been wrongly convicted or received unfair trials. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Virginia state Sen. Kenneth W. Stolle, who sponsored the bill that \nwould do away with\u0014\n   Virginia's 21-day limit, said the legislation would afford more \nprotections to inmates. \u0014\n\u0014\n   ``Just because Earl Washington worked his way through the system, \nthat doesn't mean\u0014\n   that the system always works for somebody like Earl Washington,'' \nsaid Stolle, a\u0014\n   Republican. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Stolle's bill would require the storage of biological evidence \nused at trials so it could be\u0014\n   recalled should scientific advances yield better DNA testing \nmethods. The bill would\u0014\n   also allow courts to order retesting, now done at the governor's \nprerogative. Inmates\u0014\n   who claimed to have new evidence would be able to appeal directly \nto the state\u0014\n   Supreme Court. \u0014\n\u0014\n    \u0014\n\u0014\n   On the Net: \u0014\n\u0014\n   Death Penalty Information Center: http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/\u0014",

Packer | posted 9/19/00\u0014\n                      The first principle of sound demonology is that \nyou cannot\u0014\n                      have a more adequate idea of Satan than you \nhave of God.\u0014\n                      That is because Satan is God's creature, and \ncreatures must\u0014\n                      be understood in relation to their Creator.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today's Western world, having lost the \nknowledge of God, is\u0014\n                      currently in process of losing the knowledge of \nman and of\u0014\n                      Satan. Man is thought of as no more than a sort \nof ape,\u0014\n                      Satan is seen as no more than a medieval \nbugaboo (i.e., a\u0014\n                      sick fancy), and temptation is reduced to \nconflict between our\u0014\n                      higher and lower natures (Freud's ego and id). \nWe need\u0014\n                      biblical clarity, and we must start with \ngetting our minds\u0014\n                      straight about God himself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How, biblically, should we think of God's \nomnipresence? The\u0014\n                      word means that God knows exhaustively, and \nupholds and\u0014\n                      touches continually, every single item in the \nuniverse he has\u0014\n                      made, from the tiniest genes and electrons to \nthe most\u0014\n                      massive stars in the expanding universe to the \nmost complex\u0014\n                      mind-body interactions in the psyche of over 6 \nbillion people.\u0014\n                      God is here, there, and everywhere, and his \nmind and hand\u0014\n                      are on everything. We are never out of his \nsight (Ps. 139), and\u0014\n                      we cannot get away from him (John 1). Wherever \nwe are, he\u0014\n                      is there too. This is not simply a matter of \ntranscending\u0014\n                      spatial confines. Strictly speaking, God has no \nspatial\u0014\n                      location at all, for space belongs to the \ncreated order and\u0014\n                      exists in him rather than he in it. Such is the \nomnipresence of\u0014\n                      God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What to think, then, of \"your enemy, the devil\" \n(1 Pet. 5:8)?\u0014\n                      \"Devil\" means slanderer, through malice and\u0014\n                      misrepresentation; \"Satan\" means adversary. He \nis called the\u0014\n                      evil one and an enemy (Matt. 13:19), a murderer \nand the\u0014\n                      father of lies (John 8:44), who \"has been \nsinning from the\u0014\n                      beginning\" (1 John 3:8). He is an angel, one of \nthe\u0014\n                      nonembodied personal creatures God made for the \njoy he and\u0014\n                      they would find in their worship, fellowship, \nand service. (To\u0014\n                      that end, he also made humans.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Satan is a rebel and corrupt. He leads the \nangels who,\u0014\n                      according to 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 67, are now \nunder\u0014\n                      restraint in \"dungeons\" and \"chains\" and face \nthe judgment of\u0014\n                      eternal fire for their sins (Matt. 25:41). \nThese fallen angels,\u0014\n                      whose character is set in the mold of their \nfirst transgression\u0014\n                      as later Adam's would be, are called demons in \nthe New\u0014\n                      Testament. God restrains them to limit what \nthey can do, but\u0014\n                      their hostility toward God and the godly has no \nlimits.\u0014\n                      Wrecking God's work, thwarting his grace, and \nbringing us to\u0014\n                      spiritual ruin is their common goal with Satan. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Called \"the tempter\" in 1 Thessalonians 3:5, \nSatan seeks to\u0014\n                      trap God's servants into doing evil, thinking \nit to be good, and\u0014\n                      lapsing into unbelief that makes obedience \nimpossible and\u0014\n                      disobedience inevitable. Thus he assaults all \nChristians (Eph.\u0014\n                      6:1113). Believers walk into Satan's war with \nGod and\u0014\n                      should not wonder when he turns his fire on \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Satan tempts many people simultaneouslydoes \nthat mean\u0014\n                      he is omnipresent? No. Omnipresence, as we saw, \nis unique\u0014\n                      to the Creator. Satan comes and goes (Matt. \n4:3, 11; Job\u0014\n                      1:712). So how does he manage these multiple\u0014\n                      temptations? Scripture does not say, but two \ntheories are\u0014\n                      common. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theory one, recognizing that all angels have \npowers beyond\u0014\n                      ours to move around and see into people, posits \nthat Satan\u0014\n                      has the power of \"multipresence\"not \n\"omnipresence,\" but\u0014\n                      not as spacially limited as humans. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theory two, surely the more natural, is that \nthe New\u0014\n                      Testament writers do what we do when speaking of\u0014\n                      warsthat is, ascribe all the hostile action to \nthe opposing\u0014\n                      leader. \"Hitler (or Napoleon or Saddam) \nattacked,\" we say,\u0014\n                      when in fact subordinates acted at their \nleader's command.\u0014\n                      Most Christians, like C. S. Lewis in The \nScrewtape Letters,\u0014\n                      hold some form of this view, and have always \ndone so. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Either way, James's admonition, \"Resist the \ndevil, and he will\u0014\n                      flee from you\" (4:7), explodes any idea of \nSatan's\u0014\n                      omnipresence by promising moments when he will \nnot be\u0014\n                      with us. Jesus knew such moments (Luke \n4:13)and so may\u0014\n                      we. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      J. I.

    "title": "IDOLATRY: GOD'S PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER 1",
    "words": "Idolatry: God's \nPublic Enemy Number 1\u0014\n                                                        Idolatry in \nhis own house\u0014\n\u0014\n(A very strange interpretation by C. Peter Wagner)\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years I have been both amazed and appalled at how little many of \nmy friends really know about idolatry. They all hate it because God \nhates it. But very few of them, even though they are top Christian \nleaders, really understand what they are supposed to be hating.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reason for this, I am sure, is that the majority of my friends \nare Westerners. Many of them have traveled extensively through non- \nWestern idolatrous nations, but few have lived there as career \nmissionaries long enough to learn the vernacular language. \nConsequently, their knowledge of the deeper dimensions of non- \nWestern culture is somewhat limited.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, it would come as a surprise to many if they heard me \naffirm that in places like Taiwan or Bali or Kyoto or Thailand, \nidolatry would be a 10. However, on the same scale, idolatry in the \nUSA might rank at about a 4 or a 5. Possibly a city like New Orleans \nwould be up to a 6. Their knee-jerk reaction might be to say, \"Oh, \nAmericans are just as idolatrous as Taiwanese or Japanese, but in a \ndifferent way!\" Unfortunately, they are wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nRedefining ldolatry\u0014\nIn order to attempt to prove their point they try to redefine \nidolatry. Any sin that interrupts our relationship to God becomes \nidolatry. Internet pornography is so-and-so's idol. Watching too much \nTV is idolatry. If a certain person eats too much they are said to \nworship their food more than God. If someone goes to the beach \ninstead of going to church, the beach is seen as their idol. None of \nthe above is what the Bible regards as idolatry.\u0014\n.\u0014\n  The enemy attacks us through the world, the flesh, and the devil. \nMost everyone knows this, but some have not learned to tell the \ndifference between the  three. True idolatry falls into the category \nof \"the devil.\" Fleshly sins like drunkenness or stealing or adultery \nare not regarded biblically as idolatry.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the Ten Commandments.\u0014\nViolating any of the commandments is a sin which can come between us \nand God. But only the first two relate to idolatry: (I) serving no \ngods except the true God and (2) making graven images.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is Idolatry?\u0014\nHere is the technical definition of idolatry:  Idolatry is \nworshiping, serving, pledging allegiance to,\u0014\ndoing acts of obeisance to, paying homage to, forming alliances with, \nmaking covenants with, seeking power from, or in any other way \nexalting any supernatural being other than God. The supernatural \nbeings refer to angels, cherubim, seraphim, Satan, principalities, \npowers, deities, territorial spirits, goddesses, and demonic beings \non any other level.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling miscellaneous sins \"idolatry\" is dangerous because it diverts \nattention from the real thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIdolatry in the House of God\u0014\nIdolatry in general is bad enough, but idolatry in the house of God \nupsets the Lord more than idolatry among pagan people. God didn't \nsend Assyria or Babylon or Egypt captivity because they worshiped \nidols even though they would have scored a 10 on the idolatry scale. \nBut His jealousy surfaced and He poured out His wrath when His people \nbegan worshiping idols and honoring false gods! Idols themselves are \nphysical objects. They have no power in them-\u0014\nselves. They are not evil spirits. However, evil spirits attach \nthemselves to idols and they often receive\u0014\nworship through them. Once they are there they may remain attached, \neven if the object is carried from one continent to another.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church I belong to has about 7000 members. Many of them sin, \nsome, sadly, on a regular basis. Some are demonized and need \ndeliverance. Holiness has not yet become a reality in the lives of \nmany church members. But I would be greatly surprised to find that \nany but a very small percentage of them commit idolatry either \nregularly or occasionally. Most American Protestant Christians don't.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnclean Objects in Our Homes\u0014\nHaving said that, it is also a fact that many American church members \nor their families cannot be all that God wants them to be because \nthey are victimized by the devil. A common root of that victimization \nis unclean objects in our homes. We may not worship  them per se, but \nthey nevertheless furnish ground for the activity of evil spirits in \nour lives and in the lives of those around us. If we are praying that \nGod will use us as instruments in His hands to bring revival to our \ncities and to the nations, it is time to make sure that all \nobstructions are removed from our homes. Not only should we do it \nnow, but we should do it on a regular basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosiah Declaration Sunday\u0014\n\u0014\nMy vision is to see local churches allover the world observe Josiah \nDeclaration Sunday. Pastors will be preaching on idolatry and \nreferring to Josiah's initiative. Church people will cleanse their \nhomes, and bring unclean articles. Churches will be of one accord in \ndestroying these items, some by bonfire.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we do this on a large scale? On behalf of the Strategic \nPrayer Network, I am announcing an annual \"Josiah Declaration\" \nSunday. King Josiah was the king who most thoroughly rooted out \nidolatry from the people of God (see 2 Kings 22-23). The Josiah \nDeclaration Sunday will be the second Sunday in September each year. \nIn 2001 it is Sunday, September 9.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe theory is in my book, Hard Core Idolatry: Facing the Facts \n(Wagner Publications) and the practice is in \"Ridding Your Home of \nSpiritual Darkness\" by Chuck Pierce and Rebecca Sytsema Wagner \nPublications). You can order these books through Global Prayer News \nor electronically at www.arsenalbooks.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoving to a New level\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this 21 st Century, God has called us to new levels of prayer and \nintercession for the nations, especially for the 40/70 Window. We \ncannot hope to reach those levels unless we have broken, not only \nfrom idolatry itself, but also from any objects in our homes that may \ngive the enemy an excuse to keep us from being everything that God \nwants us to be.\u0014",

A \nyounger employee noticed this apparent breach of justice after \nworking under the man for several years. He bravely asked his foreman \nwhy management treated him so unfairly in the area of advancement. \nThe wiser and more mature foreman explained, \"Many years ago I had an \nargument with my supervisor . . . and I won.\" Winning an argument can \nhave very grave consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\n* Bits & Pieces, Dec. 10, 1992, p. 15\u0014",

    "words": "A small child waits with impatience the arrival home of a parent. She \nwishes to relate some sandbox experience. She is excited to share the \nthrill that she has known that day. The time comes; the parent \narrives. Beaten down by the stresses of the workplace the parent \noften replies: Not now, honey, Im busy, go watch television. The \nmost often spoken words in the American household today are the \nwords: go watch television. If not now, when? Later. But later never \ncomes for many and the parent fails to communicate at the very \nearliest of ages. We give her designer clothes and computer toys, but \nwe do not give her what she wants the most, which is our time. Now, \nshe is fifteen and has a glassy look in her eyes. Honey, do we need \nto sit down and talk? Too late. Love has passed by.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe person who wrote these words was Robert Keeshan, better known to \nAmerica as Captain Kangaroo.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think Keeshan was on to something. There are many things in life \nthat\u0014\ncause stress. But there are few that can break the heart like the \nloss of a\u0014\nchild. To be sure there are many ways to lose children. We can lose \nthem by\u0014\na tragic death. We can lose them due to broken relationships. And, we \ncan\u0014\nlose them by failing to develop the strength of character in them \nthat they\u0014\nwill need to resist evil. Elisha did not know what had happened but he\u0014\nguessed something was not right; otherwise, she would not be \ntraveling to\u0014\nfind him. Elisha sent his servant out to greet this well-to-do-woman \nwith\u0014\nthree questions: Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? \nIs it\u0014\nwell with your child?\u0014",

    "words": "Parenting\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is in the home that we first develop our sense of who we are. \nEvery child\u0014\nhas a right to a secure, happy home life. Every child has a right to \nthe\u0014\nlove and nurture of his or her parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nAkin to identity is the question of self-worth. Dr. James Dobson, \nauthor of\u0014\nseveral excellent books on raising children cautions us that, A \nchild can\u0014\nlearn to doubt his worth at home even when he is deeply loved by his\u0014\nparents! Destructive ideas find their way into his thinking process, \nleading\u0014\nhim to conclude that he is ugly or incredibly stupid or that he has \nalready\u0014\nproved himself to be a hopeless failure in life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous Psychiatrist Dr. Alfred Adler had an experience when a \nyoung boy\u0014\nwhich illustrates just how powerful such a belief can be upon \nbehavior and\u0014\nability. He got off to a bad start in arithmetic and his teacher \nbecame\u0014\nconvinced that he was dumb in mathematics. The teacher then advised \nthe\u0014\nparents of this fact and told them not to expect too much of him. \nThey too\u0014\nwere convinced. Alder passively accepted the evaluation they had \nplaced upon\u0014\nhim. And his grades in arithmetic proved they had been correct. One \nday,\u0014\nhowever, he had a sudden flash of insight and thought he saw how to \nwork a\u0014\nproblem the teacher had put on the board, and which none of the other \npupils\u0014\ncould work. He announced as much to the teacher. She and the whole \nclass\u0014\nlaughed. Whereupon, he became indignant, strode to the blackboard, and\u0014\nworked the problem much to their amazement. In doing so, he realized \nthat he\u0014\ncould understand arithmetic. He felt a new confidence in his ability, \nand\u0014\nwent on to become a good math student.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need to encourage our children. We need not only to surround them \nwith\u0014\nlove but we need to help them feel competent as persons.\u0014",

Why write it when you can phone or \nfax it?\u0014\nWe expect instant results and instant action. After all, we have \ninstant\u0014\nfoods and instant drinks, so why not instant results and instant \nresponses?\u0014\nWe can't wait. We want people to understand now! We want people to \nchange\u0014\nnow! Waiting for the Lord's leading and timing is so hard, but still \nJesus\u0014\nsaid to do it: \"Wait for the promised Holy Spirit.\" Don't run ahead \nof God,\u0014\nfor if you run without waiting on God, you will run with no power \n(and with\u0014\ndisastrous results). If you try to \"hurry up\" the hatching of a baby \nbird or\u0014\nchick, you only destroy the baby to be born. So, too, when we run \nahead of\u0014\nGod do we destroy the wonderful plan that he has in mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, having been told to \"tarry,\" the disciples went to that upper \nchamber to\u0014\nwait and to pray. In fact, they devoted themselves to prayer. What \nmust it\u0014\nhave been like as they met in that room for the first two or three \ndays?\u0014\nThey would be gathered in close physical proximity, but their wills \nmight\u0014\nwell have been miles apart. The confinement would lend itself to \narguments\u0014\nand dissension. Remember, these were normal people like you and me. \nThere\u0014\nhad been a lot of disagreements among them previously. They had \nexperienced\u0014\nsharp divisions over rank, importance, and who would have the highest \nseat.\u0014\nThey were strong-willed persons with conflicting ideas. But the \nwaiting and\u0014\nthe praying began to do something for them, for the scripture says \nthat they\u0014\n(on the tenth day of waiting), when the Spirit came, were of one \naccord!\u0014\nImagine that! As they prayed and tarried they became fully open to \nGod and\u0014\nmore loving toward each other. Such harmony and peace prepared their \nhearts\u0014\nto receive the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarbara Brokhoff, Grapes Of Wrath Or Grace, CSS Publishing, Lima, \nOhio.\u0014",

Doesnt \nthat\u0014\noffend you just a little  the suggestion that there are those things \nin\u0014\nlife we have not, and furthermore, will not ever, figure out? Now \nthat weve\u0014\nbecome so advanced that we can put fax machines in cars and can send\u0014\nourselves messages back from Venus, we are not really open to the \nsuggestion\u0014\nthat there are those things that always have been and always will be\u0014\nmysteries to us. We assume that our only limitations are time and \nenergy,\u0014\nand, given enough of the two, there is really nothing we cant \nultimately\u0014\nknow.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo when we come to a doctrinal matter like the Trinity, the \ntemptation is to\u0014\nwant one neat analogy that will make it all clear, one concise \nstatement on\u0014\nthe Trinity that will settle it for us and allow us to move on to the \nnext\u0014\nproblem.

And kill them so methodically, one \nby one, holding\u0014\n                       them under the bath water (imagine the eyes \nstaring back)\u0014\n                       and laying them out on the bed wrapped in \nsheets like little\u0014\n                       Christian martyrs, Mary, 6 months, Luke, 2, \nPaul, 3, and\u0014\n                       John, 5.\u0014\n                               (Noah, for some reason, she left in \nthe tub.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                THE LEGACY OF FILICIDE\u0014\n                              It all seemed so monstrous and perverse \nand\u0014\n                       unthinkable, except that it does happen. \nParents have killed\u0014\n                       their children since time immemorial. Fathers \nare slightly\u0014\n                       more likely to kill their spawn, according to \nthe Justice\u0014\n                       Department. But mothers, too, commit \nfilicide for all kinds\u0014\n                       of motives dark and strange or sometimes \nbanal. In Greek\u0014\n                       legend, Medea killed her sons to spite their \nunfaithful father.\u0014\n                       In China, parents still kill their daughters \nbecause they are\u0014\n                       not sons. In American suburbia, teenagers have \nbeen\u0014\n                       known to leave their unwanted progeny in \nDumpsters and\u0014\n                       public bathrooms. Most commonly, they \nsuffocate their\u0014\n                       babies while stifling a cry. Though parents \neverywhere\u0014\n                       recoiled at Andrea Yatess coldblooded \nmadness, not a few\u0014\n                       mothers were reminded of how they, too, have \nfelt at their\u0014\n                       wits end (see Anna Quindlens column, \nPlaying God on\u0014\n                       No Sleep,). About 200 children are killed by \ntheir mothers\u0014\n                       every year, according to Justice statistics. \nSometimes moms\u0014\n                       blame the Devil. Or they think they are saving \ntheir children\u0014\n                       from a hellish life by sending them to heaven. \nThe\u0014\n                       psychologists call these altruistic \nkillings.  \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Andrea Yates was apparently suffering from a \nspecific,\u0014\n                       diagnosableand treatablecondition called \npostpartum\u0014\n                       psychosis. Most women get the blues for at \nleast a brief time\u0014\n                       after having a baby. Maybe one in 10 is \ndepressed, and\u0014\n                       perhaps one in a thousand is severely \ndepressed. Yates\u0014\n                       was so low that she was derangedclinically \nspeaking,\u0014\n                       psychotic, subject to delusions. Psychotics \nsometimes hear\u0014\n                       voices commanding them to commit ghastly acts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       What possessed Andrea Yates? What terrible \nplace\u0014\n                       had she gone to in her own mind? It may be \nmonths, if ever,\u0014\n                       before we really know. But late last week \nNEWSWEEK was\u0014\n                       able to put together a portrait of Yates that \nat least hints at\u0014\n                       why she felt driven beyond all hope to \nself-hatred and\u0014\n                       murder. Most mass killers are sociopaths, \nutterly alienated\u0014\n                       from other human beings. They are callous or \nsadistic.\u0014\n                       Andrea was the op-posite; if anything, she \napparently cared\u0014\n                       too much. She may have felt she could never do \nenough for\u0014\n                       her demanding husband. In a horribly twisted \nway, she may\u0014\n                       have tried to be too good a mother.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         ALWAYS THINKING OF OTHERS\u0014\n                              She was always trying to be such a \ngood girl,\u0014\n                       Andreas mother, Jutta Kennedy, told a NEWSWEEK\u0014\n                       reporter in an exclusive interview late last \nweek, wiping away\u0014\n                       tears while watering flowers outside her \nmodest, one-story\u0014\n                       home. She was the most compassionate of my \nchildren.\u0014\n                       Always thinking of other people, never \nherself. She was\u0014\n                       always trying to care for everybody. Jutta \nKennedy recalled\u0014\n                       how every day, for seven or eight years, \nAndrea would\u0014\n                       come to her parents house to take care of her \nfather,\u0014\n                       Andrew Kennedy, who suffered from Alzheimers. \nHer father\u0014\n                       was completely out of it, Mrs. Kennedy said, \nremembering\u0014\n                       how her husband had doted on Andrea, the \nyoungest of the\u0014\n                       five Kennedy children. Andrea was his baby. \nShe was\u0014\n                       named for him. And she would do everything for \nhim. She\u0014\n                       would change his clothes and wash him and help \nfeed him.\u0014\n                       At the same time, Andrea was often pregnant \nand caring for\u0014\n                       her own growing family. Even as she coped with \nall this,\u0014\n                       when a neighbor needed help she would run next \ndoor, her\u0014\n                       mother recalled.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Andrea had always\u0014\n                       been the perfect child,\u0014\n                       eager to please. She was\u0014\n                       valedictorian of her\u0014\n                       high-school class and filled\u0014\n                       her home with swimming\u0014\n                       trophies. She married\u0014\n                       another perfect child,\u0014\n                       Russell (Rusty) Yates, who\u0014\n                       was working as a computer\u0014\n                       expert at NASAs Johnson\u0014\n                       Space Center in Houston. At\u0014\n                       DuPont Senior High School\u0014\n                       near Nashville, Tenn., Rusty\u0014\n                       had been voted Mr.\u0014\n                       DuPont, the class favorite,\u0014\n                       football star and all-round\u0014\n                       best boy. If we wanted to\u0014\n                       have someone to represent\u0014\n                       us to the nation, Rusty would be the one to do \nit, said a\u0014\n                       classmate, Jim Jackson. Another classmate \nrecalled the\u0014\n                       crowd chanting Rusty! Rusty! at pep rallies \nfor, like, 10\u0014\n                       minutes straight.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Married in 1993, Rusty and Andrea apparently \ndecided\u0014\n                       that the best way to bring up the children was \nto do it\u0014\n                       themselves. Andrea gave up her job as a nurse \nin a cancer\u0014\n                       clinic. He didnt want her working at all, \nformer neighbor\u0014\n                       Sylvia Cole told the Houston Chronicle. He \nwanted her\u0014\n                       staying at home. Unlike most parents, they \ndid not turn to a\u0014\n                       neighborhood school or church to help raise \ntheir kids.\u0014\n                       Though religious, they belonged to different \ndenominations.\u0014\n                       Andrea had been raised Roman Catholic, and \nRusty was a\u0014\n                       Methodist and high-school member of the \nevangelical\u0014\n                       Fellowship of Christian Athletes. The Yates \nhome was full of\u0014\n                       religious artifacts, according to a policeman \nat the crime\u0014\n                       scene. Rusty brought religion to the T-ball \nteam he coached\u0014\n                       for his two oldest boys. They prayed before \nevery game\u0014\n                       and after every game, and they prayed at \npractice, said\u0014\n                       Rick Mayfield, whose boys also played on the \nteam.\u0014\n                              Education, like faith, was centered at \nhome. In addition\u0014\n                       to feeding, bathing and disciplining four \nrambunctious boys,\u0014\n                       Andrea taught them phonics and math with \nworkbooks from\u0014\n                       a home-schooling service. Between caring for \nher father\u0014\n                       and her children, it is hard to think that \nAndrea ever had\u0014\n                       time for herself. There have been small and \nvague hints\u0014\n                       from family members that Andrea showed some \nsigns of\u0014\n                       mental distress before she began having \nchildren, although\u0014\n                       her mother denied it to NEWSWEEK. Certainly, \nserious\u0014\n                       problems surfaced after the birth of her \nfourth boy, Luke,\u0014\n                       two years ago. Rusty Yates was not specific \nabout the\u0014\n                       symptoms, but they must have been severe, \nbecause his\u0014\n                       wife was treated not only with \nantidepressants, Effexor and\u0014\n                       Wellbutrin, but with Haldol, a very strong \nantipsychotic\u0014\n                       medication. To medical experts, this suggests \nthat she was\u0014\n                       possibly delusional. The medication seemed to \nwork. It took\u0014\n                       a while, said Rusty last week, but she just \nsnapped out of\u0014\n                       it, she was like herself again, all of a \nsudden. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       But not before she tried to kill herself. \nAccording to a\u0014\n                       neighbor of her parents, Jesse Torres, Andrea \noverdosed at\u0014\n                       her parents house in June 1999 by swallowing \na handful of\u0014\n                       pills prescribed for her ailing father. Torres \nhad been struck\u0014\n                       by how much she was struggling at the time, \ntrying to care\u0014\n                       for her father and her children at once. This \nneighbor had\u0014\n                       observed Andrea on a ladder precariously \ndecorating a\u0014\n                       Christmas tree while heavily pregnant and \nrunning around\u0014\n                       her parents kitchen, trying to feed her \nparents and children\u0014\n                       as her own plate grew cold.\u0014\n                              \u0014\n                       THATS WHAT WE WANTED\u0014\n                              The Yateses were almost certainly \nwarned by doctors\u0014\n                       that postpartum depression often recurs when \nmore children\u0014\n                       come along. Asked last week by a reporter if \nhe had\u0014\n                       worried about having more kids, knowing those \nproblems\u0014\n                       were out there, Rusty replied: I talked to \nAndrea when she\u0014\n                       was feeling a little bit better. We had a good \ntalk about that.\u0014\n                       And, you know, both of us really went into our \nmarriage\u0014\n                       saying well just have as many kids as come \nalong. And\u0014\n                       thats what we wanted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Andreas depression returned with a vengeance \nwithin\u0014\n                       a few months of the birth of her fifth child \nlast winter, her\u0014\n                       daughter, Mary. According to Rusty, it was \ntriggered or at\u0014\n                       least aggravated by the death of her father. \nWithout him to\u0014\n                       care for, overwhelmed by her own family, she \njust went\u0014\n                       spiraling down, said Rusty. This time she did \nnot return to\u0014\n                       normal. She never responded that well, said \nRusty. She\u0014\n                       got to about, maybe, 65 percent, and sort of \nstayed there.\u0014\n                       She became robotic, he said, and showed \nnervous habits\u0014\n                       ... particular to her.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                  Rusty described his\u0014\n                                                  wifes tortured \nstate in a\u0014\n                                                 strange impromptu \npress\u0014\n                                                 conference on his \nlawn the\u0014\n                                                 day after the \nmurder. He\u0014\n                                                 had lain awake all \nnight, he\u0014\n                                                 said, wondering what \nhe\u0014\n                                                 might have done \ndifferently.\u0014\n                                                 Rusty was almost \neerily\u0014\n                                                 lucid, coherent and\u0014\n                       reflective, though his forehead glistened with \nsweat and his\u0014\n                       eyes had the fixed look of shock. My wife, \nIm supportive of\u0014\n                       her. But on the other [hand], I know that the \nwoman here is\u0014\n                       not the woman who killed my children.... One \nside of me\u0014\n                       blames her because, you know, she did it.

Id say, \nHow are you doing?\u0014\n                       And shed say, OK. But I could sense it \nwasnt OK. My\u0014\n                       sister, she didnt open up. He said that he \nhad noticed\u0014\n                       changes in Andreas deportment even before \nshe began\u0014\n                       having children in 1994. I think it was a \nslow process, said\u0014\n                       Kennedy. Both she and her husband, we talked \nto them a\u0014\n                       lot. But they were kind ofyou know how some \npeople dont\u0014\n                       like to ask for help? It was kind of that way. \nThey didnt want\u0014\n                       to talk. In an interview with NEWSWEEK, her \nother brother,\u0014\n                       Brian, was asked if his family supported \nRusty. Brian\u0014\n                       Kennedy paused for a moment and said, You \nshould ask\u0014\n                       our lawyer that questionId like to say some \nthings, but the\u0014\n                       truth will eventually come out. (Andrea \nYatess lawyer,\u0014\n                       George Parnham, attributed Brians remark to \nthe\u0014\n                       emotionalism of the moment and said the \nfamily is \"united.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                       CONTEMPLATING MURDERING \u0014\n                              Andrea had been contemplating murdering \nher children\u0014\n                       for some time, according to her later \nconfession. But Rustys\u0014\n                       mother, Dora Yates, thought Andrea was getting \nbetter. Last\u0014\n                       Tuesdaythe day before she drowned her \nchildrenDora\u0014\n                       had seen her daughter-in-law talking to her \nchildren and\u0014\n                       rearranging furniture, all in all seeming \nfairly normal. Dora\u0014\n                       Yates told a friend that Andrea had just been \nto the doctor\u0014\n                       and had changed medication. She was apparently\u0014\n                       contemplating therapy. Up to this point, she \nhad been\u0014\n                       reluctant to talk to a doctor about her \nproblems. She was\u0014\n                       taken off the powerful anti-psychotic drug \nHaldolin\u0014\n                       hindsight, an unfortunate step. \u0014\n\u0014\n     June 22  Mike Clay, a neighbor of the Yates, speaks\u0014\n     with NBCs Katie Couric about the tragedy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                               It is hard to conceive of the snakes \nthat were writhing in\u0014\n                       her head. She would tell police only that she \nbelieved she\u0014\n                       was a bad mother, and that her children were \nhopelessly\u0014\n                       damaged. Perhaps, in some godforsaken way, she \nbelieved\u0014\n                       that the time had come to set them free. At 9 \nthe next\u0014\n                       morning, she said goodbye to her husband as he \nleft for\u0014\n                       work. In an hour, her mother-in-law was due to \narrive to help\u0014\n                       with the kids. According to a report in the \nHouston\u0014\n                       Chronicle, quoting a police source who \nreviewed her taped\u0014\n                       confession, Andrea filled the bathtub and \nbegan killing her\u0014\n                       children. Luke was the first to die. Then \nPaul, followed by\u0014\n                       John. When each child was dead, she carried \nthe body to\u0014\n                       the bedroom, placed it on the bed and covered \nit with a\u0014\n                       sheet. Then she gathered up the baby, Mary, \nand placed\u0014\n                       her in the tub. But as she pushed her baby \nbelow the water,\u0014\n                       Noah caught her in the actand tried to run. \nShe chased\u0014\n                       him and wrestled him into the tub, alongside \nhis sister, then\u0014\n                       removed her little girl and placed her on the \nbed by her\u0014\n                       brothers. Then she called the police and her \nhusband.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Andreas tone of voice made him nervous, Rusty\u0014\n                       recalled. Whats wrong? he asked. You need \nto come\u0014\n                       home, she said. Anyone hurt? he asked. \nYes, she\u0014\n                       replied. Who? he asked. The children. All \nof them.\u0014\n                       Rustys heart just sank, he told reporters.\u0014\n                               \u0014\n                       ... ANOTHER BODY AND ANOTHER BODY AND ...\u0014\n                              At the Yates house, Houston police \nofficer Frank\u0014\n                       Stumpo found Andrea sitting calmly on the \ncouch with her\u0014\n                       hands folded across her lap. She looked at me \nand looked\u0014\n                       away, Stumpo told NEWSWEEK, as he recalled the\u0014\n                       macabre scene in an exclusive interview. \nStumpo peered\u0014\n                       into the bedroom and saw a little head, which \nhe mistook for\u0014\n                       a moment for a doll. It was the 5-year-old, \nStumpo\u0014\n                       recalled. I picked up the blanket and more \nchildren started\u0014\n                       coming into view. I saw another body and \nanother body and\u0014\n                       another body. Everybody was wet. Their hair \nwas matted\u0014\n                       and wet. Stumpo felt the 5-year-olds face. \nIt was still warm.\u0014\n                               In the bathroom, he saw an overturned \nlaundry basket\u0014\n                       and a crumpled bathmat. A little boy was \nfloating facedown\u0014\n                       in the tub.\u0014\n                               He found Andrea still sitting \ncomplacently in the living\u0014\n                       room. Do you realize what you have done? he \nasked her.\u0014\n                       She looked right at him and said, Yes, I do. \nShe told the\u0014\n                       police, I killed my children.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       HOW COULD YOU DO THIS!\u0014\n                              Stumpo looked around. The house was a \nmess, he\u0014\n                       thought, dirty and unkempt. He heard yelling \noutside. It was\u0014\n                       Rusty Yates, barred by police from entering \nthe crime\u0014\n                       scene. The father came to the back door and \ngot on his\u0014\n                       hands and knees and looked through a small \nopening in the\u0014\n                       drapery. For a moment, he made eye contact \nwith Andrea.\u0014\n                       Rusty began banging on the door frame and \nyelling,\u0014\n                       Andrea, how could you do this! How could you \ndo this! She\u0014\n                       sat silent, and Stumpo pulled the drape closed.\u0014\n                               Later Stumpo went outside and asked \nRusty if he\u0014\n                       wanted a glass of water. According to Stumpo, \nRusty replied\u0014\n                       that a glass of water would be nice, but that \nhe doubted\u0014\n                       anyone would find a clean glass in the house. \nStumpo\u0014\n                       looked anyway, and couldnt find oneuntil \nAndrea calmly\u0014\n                       pointed him to the china cabinet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                 Stumpo drove Andrea\u0014\n                                                 to the station house \nin\u0014\n                                                 handcuffs. On the \nway, a\u0014\n                                                 Houston \nradio-talk-show\u0014\n                                                 host, who had just \nheard\u0014\n                                                 the gruesome news, \nbegan\u0014\n                                                 railing about how a \nhorrible\u0014\n                                                 thing had happened in\u0014\n                                                 Houston, how a \nbitch had\u0014\n                                                 killed her kids. \nStumpo\u0014\n                                                 looked in his \nrearview mirror\u0014\n                                                 at Andrea.\u0014\n                                                         She was \nlooking out\u0014\n                                                 the window, and this \nguy\u0014\n                                                 was just ripping her \napart,\u0014\n                       saying, Lets just shoot her, Stumpo \nrecalled to\u0014\n                       NEWSWEEK. It was the only time I saw her \ndisplay any\u0014\n                       emotion. Her lip was quivering. I said to her, \nYoure a\u0014\n                       celebrity.\u0014\n                               Andrea Yates, who could conceivably \nface the death\u0014\n                       penalty and will likely plead insanity, did \nnot answer. She\u0014\n                       just kept looking out the window.

It just so happened that shortly thereafter \nlightning\u0014\nstruck the bar and it burned to the ground. The owner of the bar sued \nthe\u0014\nchurch, claiming that the prayers of the congregation were \nresponsible, but\u0014\nthe church hired a lawyer to argue in court that they were not \nresponsible.\u0014\nThe presiding judge, after his initial review of the case, stated \nthat \"no\u0014\nmatter how this case comes out, one thing is clear. The tavern owner\u0014\nbelieves in prayer and the Christians do not.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.K. Johnston, Why Christians Sin, Discovery House, 1992, p. 129.\u0014",

A large corporation was \noffering\u0014\nthem a great deal of money for their site, on which the corporation \nwanted\u0014\nto put a parking lot. The money would enable the church to move to \nanother\u0014\npart of the inner city where they would find many more people to \nserve. Even\u0014\nthough this was exciting to some of the congregation, other members \nwere\u0014\nresistant to the idea. They pointed out that the church was the \nguardian of\u0014\na building whose history and architecture reached back into the early \npart\u0014\nof the nineteenth century. Denominational history had been made in \nthat\u0014\nbuilding, and some of the grand figures of the church had passed its\u0014\nportals.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually the congregation decided to sell the site and make the \nmove to a\u0014\nnew building in a teeming inner-city neighborhood. The pastor who was \nwith\u0014\nthis congregation through all this upheaval said, \"We had to decide \nwhether\u0014\nwe wanted to be in a museum or in mission.\" They couldn't have it \nboth ways.\u0014\nIt meant either staying on their site, glorying in their past history \nand\u0014\nserving a few people, or giving up their past and gearing themselves \nto a\u0014\nsignificant ministry among the city's people. They opted for mission \nstatus\u0014\nover museum status.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething of this same struggle is indicated in this scripture \npassage. The\u0014\nPharisees and scribes came down on the side of museum religion. They \nwanted\u0014\nattention given to those who were stable, pious and not a liability if\u0014\ninvited to the country club. Their's was a \"let's have our synagogue\u0014\nprograms be for us dependable, like-minded types,\" as some present-day\u0014\nchurch-growth advocates. Jesus disappointed them by insisting that \nthe issue\u0014\nwas one of mission: to reach out to those who needed great mercy, \nlessons in\u0014\netiquette, social graces, and perhaps a bath. Paying attention to \nthese\u0014\n\"lost\" persons would change the comfortable fellowship the scribes and\u0014\nPharisees enjoyed at the synagogue, to say nothing of putting a dent \ninto\u0014\nits budget.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Only..., Wallace H.

But if it does, Americans will \nhave to adapt, move on and even return to normalcy, as have the \npeople of Israel, Northern Ireland, the former Yugoslavia, Kashmir, \nSpain, Greece and Cyprus  just a few of the places rocked by \nterrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The Potency of Fear\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Prior to last week's attacks, the idea that \nAmericans are all potential targets was completely foreign to them, \nmainly because the United States hasn't been exposed to terrorism on \nsuch a grand scale, suggests psychiatrist Paul Kettl, a professor at \nPennsylvania State University.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But the potential psychological downsides are \ngrave. \"Some of the effects you see in parts of the world which have \nbeen hard hit by terrorism,\" observes Robert R. Butterworth, a Los \nAngeles-based trauma psychologist, \"include a culture where people \ndon't smile, high depression rates, increase in divorce, alcohol and \ndrug abuse as well as a rise in domestic violence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Kettl also cites trouble sleeping, concentrating \nand even fear of returning to a normal routine. And Shapira adds, \nfrom his own experience, there are other effects  like suppressed \nhostility, increased aggressiveness and decreased patience.\u0014\n\u0014\n Attacks can also be particularly hard on those who have experienced \nviolence of this sort before because they may be reliving older \ntraumas, adds Butterworth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Taking Control\u0014\n\u0014\n The key to dealing with terrorism and its potentially detrimental \nlong-term effects may lie in how people come to terms with horrific \nlife-changing incidents, say psychiatrists and trauma experts.\u0014\n\u0014\n Often the main problem at hand after an attack is the lost sense of \npersonal safety, the gnawing feeling of vulnerability. How can people \nbegin to heal \u0014\n\u0014\n themselves and regain the all-important need to feel secure? Kettl \nsays an important first step is to acknowledge that the fears and \nconcerns exist and are perfectly normal.\u0014\n\u0014\n After that, returning to routine is an essential part of the healing \nprocess, even though it usually is the hardest thing to do, experts \nagree.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The thing that seems to work best when we're shell-shocked is to go \nback to what we were doing before,\" says Butterworth. \"We have an \ninstinct to live, to try and get back to as normal routine as \npossible. Go back to school, go back to work, and try to do something \nfor yourself.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Uniting Around the Conflict\u0014\n\u0014\n Developing rituals to mark a traumatic event also goes a long way \ntoward recovery, says Brendan McAllister, director of the Mediation \nNetwork for Northern Ireland. \u0014\n\u0014\n McAllister, who also has witnessed the aftermath of terrorism, notes \nthat over time a society becomes almost professional in the way it \nhandles conflict. \"The first task is finding the survivors, then \nburying the dead. The public mourning which follows is a very \nimportant way of saying 'this is an abnormal situation,' but it does \nnot impoverish civic life,\" he explains. \u0014\n\u0014\n The next major step is dealing with what happened and interpreting \nthe causes, a task that tends to fall to religious, political, or \ncommunity officials, adds McAllister.\u0014\n\u0014\n He warns that while a community's initial reaction is to divide the \nworld into \"good\" people and \"bad\" people, in time it should strive \ntoward understanding what triggered the lashing out. In countries \nwhere handling terrorism is almost a way of life, inhabitants need to \nunderstand that the conflict is deep, one that will most likely not \nbe solved with a single action against a specific target. \u0014\n\u0014\n America itself now faces a choice of how to respond. \"Either it \npolices the problem  which is never totally successful  or it tries \nto manage security while at the same time striving to understand the \nconflict's undercurrents,\" says McAllister.\u0014\n\u0014\n Whatever the response, experts urge people to keep an open dialogue. \n\"Terrorism's goal is to firmly disrupt our way of life, not to topple \nbuildings,\" asserts Butterworth. \"People should realize that whatever \nthey're going through, whether it's flashbacks, fears, or repression, \nthey're not crazy. They should not feel that they are alone in their \nthoughts and should not think they are selfish in having worries. \nThey are just reacting normally to an abnormal situation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Copyright  2001 ABC News Internet \nVentures.\u0014",

    "words": "Islam: A Complex Faith            \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Patrick Sookhdeo\u0014\n\u0014\nThe terrorist attack on America's World Trade Centre and the Pentagon\u0014\nlast Tuesday has given rise to a media debate on Islam. Although the\u0014\nperpetrators have not yet been identified, many commentators have\u0014\nsuspected that an Islamic group may be responsible - hence the debate.\u0014\nThis article is a contribution to the debate on the nature of Islam. \nWe\u0014\nmake no assertions whatsoever as to who may have masterminded last\u0014\nTuesday's tragic events.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Muslim prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was a complex\u0014\ncharacter whose attitudes and opinions changed and evolved during his\u0014\nlifetime in response to events around him. It is not surprising to \nfind\u0014\nthat Islam is a complex faith, and cannot be pigeon-holed as \n\"peaceful\"\u0014\nor \"violent\" or under any simple heading.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuslim leaders around the world have condemned Tuesday's terrorism.\u0014\nMany leading public figures in the West have done the same, often \ngoing\u0014\non to express an understanding that Islam is a peaceable faith which\u0014\ncould never sanction such actions. It is heart-warming to see such\u0014\nconcern for the image, feelings and well-being of the Muslim community\u0014\nworldwide. We echo this concern and particularly the concern for \nMuslim\u0014\nminorities in the West, who feel themselves very vulnerable to revenge\u0014\nattacks by those who believe Muslims responsible for the World Trade\u0014\nCentre attack. The threats and intimidation that Muslims in the US, \nUK,\u0014\nAustralia etc. have reported since Tuesday are inexcusable and\u0014\nthoroughly contemptible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Islam\" means \"peace\" we are often told by Muslim and non-Muslim \nalike.\u0014\nEven before Tuesday, British newspapers and TV had tended to paint a\u0014\nglowing picture of Islam as a religion of peace, modesty, morality,\u0014\nself-discipline and family values, sadly tainted by the violence of a\u0014\nfew \"fundamentalists\". Muslim minorities nevertheless continued to\u0014\ncomplain of Islamophobia, and felt themselves unjustly portrayed in \nthe\u0014\nmedia as terrorists to a man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth lies not so much in the middle between these two extremes of\u0014\npeace and violence, but manages to embrace both extremes at the same\u0014\ntime. It is true that many individual Muslims are peace-loving and \nlaw-\u0014\nabiding. But it is not true that \"peace\" is the main characteristic of\u0014\nfaith of Islam. It is not even true that the word \"Islam\" means\u0014\n\"peace\". In fact it means \"submission\". Islam as a faith emphasises\u0014\nsubmission of Muslims to God and, by a logical extension, the\u0014\nsubmission of non-Muslims to Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them,\u0014\nbeleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)\"\u0014\nsays the Qur'an (Surah 9, verse 5). An explanatory note in the\u0014\nrespected translation by A. Yusuf Ali makes clear that this is not\u0014\nintended metaphorically: \"When war becomes inevitable it must be\u0014\npursued with vigour ... The fighting may take the form of slaughter, \nor\u0014\ncapture, or siege, or ambush and other stratagems.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are some Muslims who argue that this verse need not be\u0014\ninterpreted literally any more, but the orthodox majority hold that \nthe\u0014\nQur'an is the immutable word of God. It is true that the Qur'an also\u0014\ncontains verses urging tolerance of non-Muslims but these verses pre-\u0014\ndate the more belligerent ones. Islamic scholars have a simple rule to\u0014\ndeal with such contradictions in the Qur'an: the later verse takes\u0014\nprecedence.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother verse from the Qur'an which is not often quoted in non-Islamic\u0014\ncontexts runs:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ye shall be summoned to fight against a people given to vehement war:\u0014\nthen shall you fight or they shall submit.\" (Surah 48, verse 16). The\u0014\nmeaning here is that the Muslims should fight until their opponents\u0014\nembrace Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early days of Islam, the faith was indeed spread by the sword.\u0014\nThose who would not embrace Islam were killed. The same thing is\u0014\nhappening today in Indonesia, where at least 8,000 Christians have \nbeen\u0014\nforcibly converted to Islam by well-armed Islamic extremists. Any who\u0014\nrefused were killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthemore, many Christians are being killed by Muslims without any\u0014\nconditions being offered. Some ten thousand have been killed in\u0014\nIndonesia in the last two years or so, mostly by the well-armed Laskar\u0014\nJihad group who have declared their intention of eradicating\u0014\nChristianity. In the same time period there have been many violent\u0014\nincidents in Nigeria in which thousands of Christians have been \nkilled,\u0014\ntheir houses and churches destroyed. In Sudan, the Arab Islamic\u0014\ngovernment has been at war since 1983 with the African peoples of the\u0014\nSouth, who are mainly Christians or follow traditional African\u0014\nreligions, apparently intent on killing them all, civilians and\u0014\nmilitary.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheikh Omar Bakri Mohamed of the British-based organisation, Al-\u0014\nMuhajiroun, published on his organisation's website on 13th September\u0014\n(two days after the World Trade Centre attack) an interview in which \nhe\u0014\ndistinguished between civilian and military targets. He indicated that\u0014\nmilitary and government entities were legitimate targets for Muslims \nto\u0014\nattack. On 31st August the Kuwaiti paper Al-Watan presented arguments\u0014\nto justify the killing of non-combatants by Muslims. The article was\u0014\nconcerned particularly with Jewish non-combatants, but the thrust of\u0014\nthe argument would make it applicable to any non-Muslims living in a\u0014\ndemocracy. Citizens of a democracy have voted for their government and\u0014\npay taxes to it, ran the argument, therefore they can be attacked as \nif\u0014\nthey were the government or military.\u0014\n\u0014\nTelevision news has shown us the grotesque sight of Palestinian \nMuslims\u0014\ncelebrating the World Trade Centre attack. They are not alone. Similar\u0014\nreports are coming in of grass-roots Muslim celebrations in other \nparts\u0014\nof the world. In London a poster appeared outside Finsbury Park Mosque\u0014\nthe day after the attack. It showed the remains of the World Trade\u0014\nCentre and photos of George W. Bush and Tony Blair. The text read:\u0014\n\"Death to Bush. Death to Blair. Taliban.\" It is hard to continue to\u0014\nargue that only \"a few extremists\" are hostile to the West and the \nnon-\u0014\nMuslim world when this kind of response is so widespread.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo there are clearly two strands in contemporary Islam: the peaceable\u0014\nand the war-like. Islam is not one or the other; it is both at the \nsame\u0014\ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this it differs from Christianity. While many atrocities have been\u0014\ncommitted in the name of Christianity, they are not sanctioned by the\u0014\nteachings of the Christian faith, whose founder is called \"The Prince\u0014\nof Peace\" and whose law is summed up as love for God and others.\u0014\nAtrocities committed in the name of Islam may be deplored by many\u0014\nindividual Muslims, but it cannot be denied that they are justified by\u0014\nIslamic teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nNon-Muslim minorities\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam also differs from Christianity in its treatment of those of \nother\u0014\nfaiths. As time went on it was no longer possible for Muslims to kill\u0014\nall those who refused to accept Islam, so rules were formulated to\u0014\ngovern the treatment of non-Muslim minorities. These were based not\u0014\nonly on the Qur'an but also on traditions about Muhammad's own words\u0014\nand actions, and formed part of the Shari'ah (Islamic law).\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Shari'ah, non-Muslims living within Muslim societies\u0014\nwere to be treated very much as second-class citizens. Numerous petty\u0014\nlaws restricted and humiliated them in their daily lives at work, at\u0014\nworship, in the lawcourts etc. Those who left Islam to follow another\u0014\nreligion were, according to the Shari'ah, to be killed. The general\u0014\nattitude of contempt for non-Muslims still exists in many Muslim\u0014\ncountries and they find themselves discriminated against in many ways.\u0014\nSimilarly the ruling that a convert from Islam is deserving of death \nis\u0014\nstill followed in some countries today e.g. Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia,\u0014\nIran. Even where it is illegal to kill converts, most will find\u0014\nthemselves severely harassed and sometimes murdered with little\u0014\nlikelihood of punishment for the murderer.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians and other non-Muslims living in Muslim-majority contexts\u0014\nsuffer in a multitude of ways and feel themselves powerless and\u0014\nvoiceless. As Christians in the West it is right for us to be \nconcerned\u0014\nfor minorities in our midst, including Muslims. It is right for us to\u0014\nseek harmony in society and tolerance for all. It is right for us to\u0014\ncondemn vigilante attacks on innocent Muslims just because their faith\u0014\nmight be shared by the terrorists who destroyed the World Trade \nCentre.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut let us not forget our fellow-Christians around the world who are\u0014\nalso suffering innocently. It is unfair and unbiblical to keep silent\u0014\nabout our Christian brothers and sisters in need, just because we want\u0014\nto spare the feelings of Muslims. Sometimes there seems to be a\u0014\nconspiracy of silence about the sufferings of Christians. This only\u0014\nadds to their pain. They are hurt, perplexed, baffled and despairing.\u0014\nThey cannot understand why Christians who have the freedom and power \nto\u0014\nhelp them will not do so. Muslims are not embarrassed to show that \nthey\u0014\ncare first and foremost about their co-religionists. As Christians, \nwho\u0014\nfollow a God of love, can we do less? Our brothers and sisters depend\u0014\non us.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Sookhdeo is the founder and president of the London-based\u0014\nBarnabas Fund.\u0014",

That\u0014\n                      country has no World Trade Center we can level, \nno financial markets we\u0014\n                      can shut down, no military command center \ninvested with the authority of the\u0014\n                      state. The place is an anarchy, its radical \nfaith a cover for the hegemony of a\u0014\n                      breed of pitiless warriors who rose out of wars \nand misery to erect a reign of\u0014\n                      virtue and terror. History has been unkind to \nAfghanistan; the\u0014\n                      Taliban--literally, \"students\" or \n\"seminarians\"--added new chapters of\u0014\n                      sorrow. They are to our era, and to their \npeople, what the Khmer Rouge were\u0014\n                      to Cambodia in a time of horror: cruel avengers \nwho stripped a suffering\u0014\n                      land of the last remnants of civility.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the early outlines of America's campaign, \nAfghanistan is set to be the first\u0014\n                      target. This will be a new, serious kind of \nwarfare, President Bush vowed in a\u0014\n                      remarkable address summoning the nation to war. \nIn other words, there will be \u0014\n                      no revisiting of Clintonian warfare with \nmillion-dollar missiles being fired at $10\u0014\n                      tents, as was the case in 1998 after America's \nembassies in Kenya and \u0014\n                      Tanzania were bombed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though not a stated aim of this new drive, the \neffort may entail unseating the\u0014\n                      Taliban regime. By the doctrine of just wars, \nthis could be as clear a mission\u0014\n                      as can be found. The band of jihadists, or \n\"holy warriors,\" has precious few\u0014\n                      friends. The women of Afghanistan, to begin \nwith, would welcome the\u0014\n                      demise of a regime that has driven them into a \nmedieval hell. There would\u0014\n                      be muted celebration in Iran, for the rulers of \nthat theocracy have a dread of\u0014\n                      the Taliban. In part, it is the natural enmity \nbetween city people of a settled\u0014\n                      civilization--the Iranians--and a mountainous \nband given to brigandage and\u0014\n                      banditry. In the same vein, there shall be no \nsorrow in neighboring Tajikistan\u0014\n                      and Turkmenistan for what might befall the \nrighteous warriors.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pakistan's plight. True enough, few will openly \nembrace an American\u0014\n                      expeditionary force. For the crowds in Karachi, \nPakistan's largest city, the\u0014\n                      conflict will fall along predictable \ncivilizational and religious fault lines. The\u0014\n                      fight that matters will be the struggle of a \nseemingly professional soldier,\u0014\n                      Pakistan's military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, \nagainst the agitations and the\u0014\n                      wrath of the mob. History presented the general \na cruel dilemma: He could\u0014\n                      join the forces of stability--or let Pakistan \ndrift into further chaos. He has\u0014\n                      made his choice, asking his nation to trust him \nas he places it on the side of\u0014\n                      international order. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Pakistan, we should know, could crack. It \ncan't be what Saudi Arabia was\u0014\n                      to Desert Storm, a linchpin and a base. In that \ncampaign of a decade ago,\u0014\n                      American forces arrived into an orderly place \ndirectly menaced by Iraq's\u0014\n                      Saddam Hussein. Years of preparation had gone \ninto precisely what\u0014\n                      unfolded there: The Saudis had built military \nfacilities throughout the\u0014\n                      kingdom, support facilities for American-made \nF-15 and F-16 fighter planes,\u0014\n                      including airfields with redundant runways. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Needless to say, none of this exists in \nPakistan. Indeed, there are plotters\u0014\n                      and true believers keen to bring to the country \na parody of the reign of virtue\u0014\n                      that the Taliban imposed in Afghanistan. A \nculture of religious radicalism\u0014\n                      was unleashed during the war that Afghanistan, \nwith Pakistani support,\u0014\n                      fought against the Soviet Union. During those \nruinous years, Pakistan's\u0014\n                      tough, cynical ruler, the late Mohammed Zia \nul-Haq, promoted the spread of\u0014\n                      theocratic education, using religious schools \nas recruiting grounds for the\u0014\n                      anti-Soviet effort. We ride, then, into the \nblowback of that war.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In retrospect, it was an innocent time. The \nmujahideen who fought the\u0014\n                      Soviets seemed quaint. The journalists and \nspies who tracked their war\u0014\n                      even endeared them with a nickname, \"the mooj.\" \nBut in those barren\u0014\n                      mountains, \"the Arab Afghans\"--men like Osama \nbin Laden and his\u0014\n                      lieutenants--picked up the tools of war, and \nthe conviction that mighty powers\u0014\n                      could be undone. The maladies of the Arab \nworld, the fierce hatred between\u0014\n                      ruler and ruled, grew malignant in those years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A warning now goes out to the rulers of \nAfghanistan. They can break with\u0014\n                      their history and heed the call to reason, if \nonly to save their own lives and\u0014\n                      rule. Or they can fall back on the deadly \nlegends of Afghanistan--the hard\u0014\n                      nation that withstood two 19th-century wars \nagainst the British and the long\u0014\n                      Soviet struggle that closed little more than a \ndecade ago. It is the mark of our\u0014\n                      troubled age that a good deal of history now \nhinges on what a band of\u0014\n                      radical zealots in a ruined country decides to \ndo. A twilight war has begun.\u0014",

He left the\u0014\n                      faith for some 14 years, but had returned by \n1575 and was an elder,\u0014\n                      baptizing, and preaching at night in the fields \nin the area of Urbach\u0014\n                      and Gottingen in south Germany. The following \ndocument dates to\u0014\n                      about 1575 but retains immediacy because it \nstill sums up the\u0014\n                      position of many Christian pacifists, and \nbecause among the\u0014\n                      enemies early Anabaptists refused to fight were \naggressive Ottoman\u0014\n                      Turksa serious Muslim threat in Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are two different kingdoms on \nearthnamely, the kingdom of\u0014\n                      this world and the peaceful kingdom of Christ. \nThese two kingdoms\u0014\n                      cannot share or have communion with each other.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The people in the kingdom of this world are \nborn of the flesh, are\u0014\n                      earthly and carnally minded. The people in the \nkingdom of Christ are\u0014\n                      reborn of the Holy Spirit, live according to \nthe Spirit, and are\u0014\n                      spiritually minded. The people in the kingdom \nof the world are\u0014\n                      equipped for fighting with carnal \nweaponsspear, sword, armor,\u0014\n                      guns, and powder. The people in Christ's \nkingdom are equipped with\u0014\n                      spiritual weaponsthe armor of God, the shield \nof faith, and the\u0014\n                      sword of the Spirit to fight against the devil, \nthe world, and their own\u0014\n                      flesh, together with all that arises against \nGod and his Word. The\u0014\n                      people in the kingdom of this world fight for a \nperishable crown and\u0014\n                      an earthly kingdom. The people in Christ's \nkingdom fight for an\u0014\n                      imperishable crown and an eternal kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christ made these two kingdoms at variance with \neach other and\u0014\n                      separated. There will therefore be no peace \nbetween them. In the\u0014\n                      end, however, Christ will crush and destroy all \nthe other kingdoms\u0014\n                      with his power and eternal kingdom. But his \nwill remain eternally. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When God made his covenant with Noah after the \nflood, he\u0014\n                      commanded vengeance and punishment with the \npower of the sword\u0014\n                      to punish the evil and put to death the blood \nguilty and murderers,\u0014\n                      saying, \"Whoso sheddeth men's blood, by man \nshall his blood be\u0014\n                      shed.\" This vengeance to punish evil has \nremained unaltered in the\u0014\n                      kingdom of this world with its temporal \nauthority and will remain until\u0014\n                      the Last Day of his coming, when God will \nannihilate all the power of\u0014\n                      this world. Christ also testifies to this when \nhe commanded Peter:\u0014\n                      \"Put up your sword.\" From these words of Christ \nwe learn that the\u0014\n                      power of the sword will remain in the kingdom \nof this world to put to\u0014\n                      death the blood guilty and murderers according \nto his Father's order.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But in his kingdom peace should be kept, as he \nsays to Peter: Put\u0014\n                      up thy sword in its sheath and let them \nproceed. For that reason he\u0014\n                      healed Malchus' ear at once, and does not want \nChristians to fight\u0014\n                      with the sword for their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Concerning this power of the sword Paul teaches \nus, saying: \"The\u0014\n                      powers that be are of God. For rulers are not \na terror to good\u0014\n                      works but to the evil.\" Also: \"He beareth not \nthe sword in vain, for he\u0014\n                      is the minister of God, a revenger to execute \nwrath upon him that\u0014\n                      doeth evil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The power of the sword in the kingdom of this \nworld is ordained and\u0014\n                      commanded by God, and whoever resists the \nruler, unless he orders\u0014\n                      what is against God, resists God's order. But \nif the authorities\u0014\n                      command something that is against God, I say \nwith Peter and John:\u0014\n                      \"It is better to obey God than men.\" Likewise \nthe three men in the\u0014\n                      fiery furnace and Daniel in the lion's den.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Paul's words cited above prove that the \nvocation of government and\u0014\n                      the vocation of the Christian are diametrically \nopposed to each other,\u0014\n                      like light and darkness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Therefore the government is a good institution \nin the world, in that it\u0014\n                      punishes the bad and protects him who does \ngood. For if there were\u0014\n                      no government, one could not keep order on \nearth. Each would then\u0014\n                      do violence to the other.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Christ has given those in his kingdom a \nvery different calling and\u0014\n                      office. \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\" \nAlso: \"Dearly beloved,\u0014\n                      avenge not yourselves but rather give place \nunto wrath. For it is\u0014\n                      written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, \nsaith the Lord.'\" Further: \"If\u0014\n                      thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, \ngive him drink: for in so\u0014\n                      doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his \nhead. Be not overcome of\u0014\n                      evil, but overcome evil with good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The government is taught to execute vengeance \nand slay the blood\u0014\n                      guilty and murderers. In the New Testament \nChristians are forbidden\u0014\n                      all revenge and resistance; they are not to \nresist evil. Peter merely\u0014\n                      wants permission to ask for revenge. But Christ \nnot only refuses him\u0014\n                      this, but reprimands him for it, saying: \"Ye \nknow not what manner of\u0014\n                      spirit ye are of.\" A Christian in the peaceful \nkingdom of Christ has a\u0014\n                      loving, peaceable, merciful spirit in the \nmanner of Christ's. He\u0014\n                      forgives the penitent sinner all sin and \ntransgression. He does not\u0014\n                      resist evil. He kills nobody physically. He \ndoes not preserve his\u0014\n                      possessions with force but rather presents also \nthe other cheek\u0014\n                      rather than to oppose the one who strikes him \nwith force. He does\u0014\n                      not war. He does not injure and kill people but \nprays for those who\u0014\n                      persecute and rob him. He who is born again \nthrough the Spirit has\u0014\n                      his Father's nature and qualities in him and is \nminded as Jesus\u0014\n                      Christ was minded. Christ not only forbade \nrevenge in his kingdom\u0014\n                      but also, but his death on the cross, left us \nan example for us to\u0014\n                      follow in his footsteps, and prayed for his \nfoes on the cross, which\u0014\n                      believers also do. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      God uses the government as his minister, \nwhether it performs well or\u0014\n                      badly. If they are tyrants, God uses them as \nhis rod of punishment,\u0014\n                      who will, however, at the proper time be held \naccountable to their\u0014\n                      Superior and will have to render an exceedingly \nstrict account, as it\u0014\n                      is written: \"The powerful will suffer powerful \npain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014\n                      Click here for reprint information on \nChristianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Related Elsewhere:\u0014\n                      \"The Two Kingdoms\" is excerpted from a \ntranslation by Leonard\u0014\n                      Gross and Elizabeth Horsch Bender.

After the\u0014\n                      Reformation, a third viewpoint, \n\"annihilationism\" emerged as a\u0014\n                      minority positionfor example, in the 1660 \nconfession of the\u0014\n                      General Baptists, and among the Seventh-day \nAdventists and\u0014\n                      several other evangelical groups in the \nnineteenth century.\u0014\n                      Since 1960, several prominent British \nevangelicals, as well as\u0014\n                      Canadian theologian Clark Pinnock, have \nembraced this view.\u0014\n                      John Stott has likewise expressed sympathy for \nannihilationism\u0014\n                      while choosing to remain \"agnostic\" on the \nquestion. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One key difference between universalists and \nannihilationists is\u0014\n                      that annihilationists agree with \ntraditionalists that many will\u0014\n                      indeed be lost eternally.

Further, they claim that the presence \nof people in hell\u0014\n                      throughout eternity contradicts the Christian \ntruth that Christ\u0014\n                      has conquered every evil foe and God will \nreconcile all things\u0014\n                      in Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some annihilationists who are better described \nas holding to\u0014\n                      \"conditional immortality\" claim the idea of \neternal conscious\u0014\n                      punishment depends on the Greek concept of the \nimmortality\u0014\n                      of the soul, which they say is wrongly read \nback into the Bible.\u0014\n                      The Bible teaches, they argue, that we are \ndependent on God\u0014\n                      for life, so only through participation in \nChrist's resurrection are\u0014\n                      the saved given immortality. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Annihilationists believe the Bible teaches that \nthe end of the\u0014\n                      wicked is destruction, not eternal torment. \nBuilding from the Old\u0014\n                      Testament (Ps. 37; Mal. 4), they point to how \nJesus declared\u0014\n                      that the wicked will be cast into the \nsmoldering garbage heap\u0014\n                      of Gehenna (Matt. 5:30), where they will be \nburned up (Matt.\u0014\n                      3:10-12) and destroyed in both body and soul \n(Matt. 10:28).\u0014\n                      Similarly, Paul spoke of the fate of the lost \nas death (Rom.\u0014\n                      6:23) and destruction (1 Cor. 3:17). Peter also \nused such\u0014\n                      language (2 Peter 2), likening the destruction \nof the ungodly to\u0014\n                      the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah. And John \nanticipated the\u0014\n                      wicked being consumed in the lake of fire, \nwhich he called \"the\u0014\n                      second death\" (Rev. 20:14-15). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whatever its appeal, the annihilationist \nposition contains\u0014\n                      substantive problems. One is the biblical \nassertions that the\u0014\n                      wicked will suffer an \"eternal\" fate. \nAnnihilationists argue that\u0014\n                      the word eternal refers to the permanence of \nthe results of\u0014\n                      judgment and not to the duration of the act of \npunishment.\u0014\n                      Many Scripture passages, however, say more than \nthis. Biblical\u0014\n                      writers use the word eternal to refer not only \nto the punishment\u0014\n                      of the lost but also to the bliss of the \nrighteous (Matt. 25:46),\u0014\n                      suggesting a parallel that goes beyond the \npermanence of the\u0014\n                      pronounced judgment. The unending joy of the \nredeemed\u0014\n                      stands in contrast to the unending torment of \nthe reprobate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Also, several New Testament texts indicate that \nthe lost will\u0014\n                      suffer varying degrees of punishment. Jesus \ndeclared that\u0014\n                      those who have received greater opportunities \nfor belief will\u0014\n                      suffer more severe condemnation (Matt. 10:15; \n11:20-24; Luke\u0014\n                      12:47-48). While many annihilationists believe \nin different\u0014\n                      degrees of torment before extinction, they \nanticipate only one\u0014\n                      ultimate destiny for all the wicked, an \nundifferentiated\u0014\n                      nonexistence. But can a righteous Judge \npronounce the same\u0014\n                      sentence of destiny upon the most despicable \nvillain of human\u0014\n                      history as upon the seemingly moral pagan? \nAlso, doesn't\u0014\n                      passing out of existence trivialize the \nseriousness of the\u0014\n                      choices we make in life and the importance of \nour response to\u0014\n                      God's loving offer of community? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In sum, yes, some evangelical theologians affirm\u0014\n                      annihilationism, but it is important to keep in \nmind that\u0014\n                      annihilationists affirm several aspects of the \ntraditional view.\u0014\n                      This issue, therefore, should not be lumped in \nwith the more\u0014\n                      substantial debate over universalism, which \ndenies a final\u0014\n                      judgment altogether. The debate raised by \nannihilationists\u0014\n                      reminds us of the difficulties that arise \nwhenever we attempt to\u0014\n                      pinpoint the eternal situation of the lost. \nJust as we cannot\u0014\n                      envision what conscious bliss will mean to the \nsaved in their\u0014\n                      resurrection bodies, so also we do not know \nexactly what\u0014\n                      eternal punishment will be like. Finally, the \ncontroversy\u0014\n                      surrounding the nature of eternal damnation \nwill serve a\u0014\n                      positive purpose if it leads us to realize that \nwe ought never to\u0014\n                      speak about the fate of the lost without tears \nin our eyes. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Stanley J.

    "title": "IS YOUR CHURCH LOOKING FOR A PASTOR?",
    "words": "Some clever person has written a fictitious letter from a pastor to a \nchurch\u0014\nsearch committee. The letter reads as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I understand your church is looking for a pastor. I should like to \nsubmit\u0014\nmy application. I am generally considered to be a good preacher. I \nhave been\u0014\na leader in most of the places I have served. I have also found time \nto do\u0014\nsome writing on the side. I am over fifty years of age (no children), \nand\u0014\nwhile my health is not the best, I still manage to get enough work \ndone to\u0014\nplease my congregation. As for a reference, I am somewhat \nhandicapped. I\u0014\nhave never served in any place more than three years, and the \nchurches where\u0014\nI have preached have generally been pretty small, even though they \nwere\u0014\nlocated in rather large cities. Some places I had to leave because my\u0014\nministry caused riots and disturbances. When I stayed, I did not get \nalong\u0014\ntoo well with other religious leaders in town, which may influence \nthe kind\u0014\nof references these places will send you. I have also been threatened\u0014\nseveral times and been physically attacked. I have gone to jail three \nor\u0014\nfour times for expressing my thoughts. You will need to know that \nthere are\u0014\nsome men who follow me around undermining my work. Still, I feel sure \nI can\u0014\nbring vitality to your church. If you can use me, I should be pleased \nto be\u0014\nconsidered.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe committee was dismayed that anyone would think that their church \ncould\u0014\nuse such a man. A trouble making, absent-minded, ex-jailbird could not\u0014\npossible be an effective pastor let alone be accepted by the \ncommunity.\u0014\n\"What was his name?\" they asked. The chairman of the committee said, \nI do\u0014\nnot know. The letter is simply signed, 'Paul'.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost leadership of the early church wouldnt make it through the \nchurch\u0014\ninterview process today. Theirs was a rough and dangerous world, \nturmoil on\u0014\nevery side, both in the Jewish nation and the Roman. Think of the \npictures\u0014\nwe have seen from Afghanistan these past few weeks and you get an \nidea of\u0014\nthe kind of hardships the Apostle Paul faced as he traveled for 20 \nyears and\u0014\nthousands of miles all over the Roman world.\u0014",

Congress has closed \nand reopened. Ten thousand people\u0014\n                      are on the powerful antibiotic Cipro. Now it's \nthe CIA and the Supreme Court\u0014\n                      mailrooms. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention has sent 16 planeloads of\u0014\n                      scientistsequipped with testing equipment and \ndrugsto the nation's capital to scour\u0014\n                      buildings and swab people in a medical mystery \nthat CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan calls\u0014\n                      larger than \"anything we have done in the \n50-year history of the CDC.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After four weeks,  public-health officials were \nechoing what people on the street\u0014\n                      have suspected all along: \"We are experiencing \na bioterrorism attack,\" says Julie\u0014\n                      Gerberding, deputy director of the CDC's \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases.\u0014\n                      For the first time in history, some person or \ngroup has found an effective way to\u0014\n                      spread highly toxic anthrax spores efficiently \nenough to kill and sicken people. A\u0014\n                      poorly equipped and poorly informed \npublic-health system is now struggling to figure\u0014\n                      out the basicshow spores do their damage, how \nmany it takes, how they're\u0014\n                      transmitted. As Anthony Fauci, the National \nInstitutes of Health's infectious-disease\u0014\n                      expert, says, \"There is no reference book here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Learning curve. If there was any good news in \nlast week's confusion, it's that\u0014\n                      public-health officials are learning quickly \nabout the medical science behind\u0014\n                      bioterrorism. Transmission through the mail is \na case in point. The CDC was concerned\u0014\n                      about mail handlers in Florida, but tests of \nthe post office there revealed only traces of\u0014\n                      anthrax, and, as CDC Director Koplan says, \n\"there were no cases of illness there.\"\u0014\n                      The agency misunderstood the risk in New Jersey \nand Washington, D.C., where\u0014\n                      several mail handlers sickened and two died, \nunaware of the danger. That\u0014\n                      misjudgment illustrates how little experience \neven top health officials have with\u0014\n                      anthrax and its weapon potential. Koplan \nconcedes, \"We were still thinking that the\u0014\n                      letter with anthrax had to be opened.\" Too \nlate, scientists learned that the post office's\u0014\n                      sorting machines might be capable of shooting \nanthrax spores into the airand thus\u0014\n                      causing the most deadly kind of poisoning, \ninhalation anthrax. Some experts are\u0014\n                      suggesting that envelopes themselves are porous \nenough to allow microscopic\u0014\n                      spores to leak into the environment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It also now appears that the anthrax in the \nletter to Senate Majority Leader Tom\u0014\n                      Daschle, the most likely source of widespread \ncontamination in Washington-area\u0014\n                      postal facilities, was critically different \nfrom at least one letter in New York. The\u0014\n                      anthrax spores in the Daschle letter were \nfinely processed so that they remained tiny\u0014\n                      particles, capable of floating freely through \nthe airand into victims' lungs. By contrast,\u0014\n                      anthrax in a letter to the New York Post, which \ncaused a case of cutaneous infection,\u0014\n                      clumped together in chunks that one military \nscientist likened to \"dog chow.\" Dispersal\u0014\n                      of fine particles is a science and one that not \nmany people understand, according to\u0014\n                      Ken Alibek, who helped run the Soviet Union's \nmassive bioweapons program. It would\u0014\n                      require \"people who know the physics of \naerosols,\" Alibek says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The most pressing public-health questions now \nare whether there are more letters in\u0014\n                      circulation somewhere, how virulent they are, \nand how people should be examined\u0014\n                      and treated. \"I think it would be naive to \nthink this is over yet,\" says the CDC's\u0014\n                      Gerberding. The public certainly doesn't \nbelieve it's over, at least not in the states\u0014\n                      where cases have occurred. People are reporting \nto emergency rooms with flulike\u0014\n                      symptoms in concerned droves in and around \nWashington and in jittery trickles across\u0014\n                      the country. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unfortunately, these people were getting \nconflicting messages from doctors who\u0014\n                      were racing to educate themselves about a \ndisease they had never encountered.\u0014\n                      Early in the week, for example, hundreds of \npeople were lining up for nasal swabs,\u0014\n                      assuming they were diagnostic of infection. \nOnly later in the week did officials\u0014\n                      concede that they are not. \"Unfortunately, \nthere's absolutely no test for exposure to\u0014\n                      anthrax,\" Gerberding says. The swabs cannot \ndetermine who has been exposed to\u0014\n                      anthrax, nor can they say whether antibiotics \nare needed to protect against infection.\u0014\n                      They are used only to help determine the extent \nof the microbe's spread. \"We need to\u0014\n                      do a better job of getting across what nasal \nswabs tell us and what they don't,\" says\u0014\n                      D. A. Henderson, a Department of Health and \nHuman Services adviser and director of\u0014\n                      the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at \nJohns Hopkins University. \"And we could\u0014\n                      cut back on them. I don't think anybody had any \nidea that we would be running the\u0014\n                      number of specimens we're running now. Our labs \nare reaching a point of real\u0014\n                      stress.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The labs are also overwhelmed by the task of \nculturing thousands of samples of dust\u0014\n                      from post offices and mailrooms. Mailroom \nworkers in Washington are being told to\u0014\n                      take Cipro for 10 days because CDC anticipates \nit might take that long to get results\u0014\n                      back. Lab capacity is a particularly acute \nproblem during a bioterrorist attack. \"Our\u0014\n                      belief is that most of the state labs are at \ncapacity,\" says Mary Gilchrist, president of\u0014\n                      the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \nThe New Jersey Department of Health\u0014\n                      alone reports receiving more than 1,000 \nspecimens since the anthrax attack began. It's\u0014\n                      a matter of funding. Gilchrist estimates the \npublic-health lab system needs about $300\u0014\n                      million to upgrade facilities, add staff, and \ndevelop necessary response networks. But\u0014\n                      emergency funds from the Bush administration \nprovide just $10 million, and that's for\u0014\n                      planning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So few physicians have treated anthraxthe last \nmajor outbreak was caused by a\u0014\n                      bioweapons plant in Sverdlovsk, Russia, in \n1979that doctors treating victims are\u0014\n                      forced to experiment. Their great discovery may \nwell be that inhalation anthrax, long\u0014\n                      believed to be fatal if untreated early, may be \nnot such an invincible foe. Last Tuesday\u0014\n                      Ernesto Blanco smiled and waved as he left \nCedars Medical Center in Miami. Carlos\u0014\n                      Omenaca, the infectious-disease specialist who \nwas called in to treat Blanco, says\u0014\n                      that the treatment program that saved Blanco's \nlife against all odds was the result of\u0014\n                      educated guesswork. When the 73-year-old \nmailroom worker was admitted to the\u0014\n                      hospital, it looked like he had pneumonia, so \nOmenaca had treated him with\u0014\n                      cephalosporin and doxycycline, standard \nantibiotics. It was only after Blanco's boss at\u0014\n                      American Media called to tell the doctor that \nanother employee had been diagnosed\u0014\n                      with inhalation anthrax that Omenaca realized \nwhat he was up against. \"I got really\u0014\n                      frightened,\" Omenaca says. \"I thought, if this \nis a second case of anthrax, this is a\u0014\n                      man-made thing. There will be more cases of \nexposure and disease.\" He gathered up\u0014\n                      all the medical literature on treating \nanthraxwhich isn't much, he notesand switched\u0014\n                      his patient to intravenous Cipro. After several \ndays of struggle, his condition improved.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Experimenting. Doctors in Northern Virginia are \nalso experimenting in their effort to\u0014\n                      keep two post office workers alive. The two \n56-year-old men had gone to Inova\u0014\n                      Fairfax Hospital on October 19 and 21, \ncomplaining of flu symptoms. Their place of\u0014\n                      employment raised suspicions; so did chest \nX-rays and CT scans. One man's X-ray\u0014\n                      showed a widening space between the lungs, \nindicating fluid buildup in his chest. Last\u0014\n                      Friday, though still in serious condition, the \nmen were talking and breathing on their\u0014\n                      own, defying the gloomy predictions in the \nliterature. Their treatment: intravenous\u0014\n                      Cipro, along with clindamycin, an antibiotic \nthat works as an antitoxin. This may be\u0014\n                      effective because even if the bacteria are \nkilled, the toxins they produce continue to\u0014\n                      circulate through the body. Finally, they added \nrifampin, a drug used to treat\u0014\n                      tuberculosis that can penetrate white blood \ncells. (Guidelines for this regimen are\u0014\n                      available at the Kaiser Permanente Web site, \nwww.kp.org.) Based on the experimental\u0014\n                      efforts of the doctors in Florida and Virginia, \nthe CDC last week endorsed\u0014\n                      multiantibiotic therapy for inhalation anthrax, \na regimen that is now being used for the\u0014\n                      State Department mail handler hospitalized in \nWinchester, Va. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Health officials are also learning about how to \nbest protect people at work and at\u0014\n                      home from anthrax and other bioweapons. D.C. \nHealth Director Ivan Walks was\u0014\n                      stunned to learn while watching Nightline last \nweek that the Daschle letter contained\u0014\n                      finely ground anthrax capable of floating \nthrough the air. The next day, his office\u0014\n                      ordered workers at all post offices across the \nDistrict to take antibiotics. And the\u0014\n                      White House has authorized $175 million to \nprotect postal workers and the mail itself.\u0014\n                      Last Tuesday, the Postal Service shipped 2 \nmillion face masks to workers,\u0014\n                      predominantly on the East Coast. \"Use of these \nmasks is not mandatory, but strongly\u0014\n                      recommended,\" the service told its staff. The \nsame goes for plastic gloves, which are\u0014\n                      also being supplied. Workers have been told to \nno longer clean sorting machines by\u0014\n                      blowing air on them, a technique that \ninvestigators speculate helped spread the\u0014\n                      spores. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A more long-term, and more comfortable, \nsolution may lie in sterilizing mail with\u0014\n                      \"E-beam\" technology (chart, Page 51). \nMeanwhile, though, people are left to wonder\u0014\n                      whether cross-contamination could bring anthrax \ninto their homes. \"Should we worry\u0014\n                      about the Visa bill that followed the Daschle \nletter through the facility?\" asks Jon\u0014\n                      Coifman, a communications specialist who lives \nin Washington. \"I think the risks of that\u0014\n                      are very, very small,\" Koplan says. \"Is there \nanything wrong with washing your hands\u0014\n                      after you bring in the mail? No. We at CDC have \nbeen pushing hand washing for a long\u0014\n                      time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Financial IV. Efforts are underway to pump \nbillions of dollars into the public-health\u0014\n                      and medical infrastructure to better prepare \nfor the possibility of a larger bioterrorism\u0014\n                      attack than the United States is experiencing \ntoday. Two weeks ago HHS's Thompson\u0014\n                      proposed to spend $1.5 billion in emergency \nfunding to address the current\u0014\n                      deficiencies in public-health preparedness, \nmost of it for antibiotics and vaccines for\u0014\n                      the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile. Last \nweek, however, he persuaded Bayer to\u0014\n                      cut the price the company charges the \ngovernment for Cipro by almost 50 percent so\u0014\n                      more could be stockpiled at less cost. \nDemocrats countered last week with a $7 billion\u0014\n                      bioterror package that would funnel at least $2 \nbillion directly to state and local health\u0014\n                      departments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thompson is also criticizing the companies \nmaking this year's flu vaccine for not\u0014\n                      producing enough fast enough. \"Flu and anthrax \nhave the same symptoms,\"\u0014\n                      Thompson says, \"and we want to minimize the \npeople coming down with flu. That's\u0014\n                      important.\" Indeed, doctors at two \nWashington-area emergency rooms had diagnosed\u0014\n                      the two mail handlers who died of inhalation \nanthrax with flu and sent them home. By\u0014\n                      the time they returned to the hospital, their \ninfection was too advanced for them to be\u0014\n                      saved, underscoring the need not only for flu \nvaccine but for doctor education.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mohammad Akhter, executive director of the \nAmerican Public Health Association,\u0014\n                      estimates that local health agencies need $1 \nbillion to get ready for future bioterrorism\u0014\n                      attacksespecially those that would deploy \nhighly contagious microbes like smallpox\u0014\n                      and plague. He likens the nation's \nvulnerability to that of the North American Indians,\u0014\n                      who were decimated by smallpox and other \ndiseases brought by Europeans. \"We're\u0014\n                      more vulnerable than the indigenous \npopulations,\" Akhter says. \"We're a very mobile\u0014\n                      society. We need to have prompt action if \nanything like that happens.\" In a survey\u0014\n                      released last week at the APHA's annual \nmeeting, just 20 percent of state and local\u0014\n                      health departments said they're prepared; 24 \npercent of the local health agencies\u0014\n                      reported they had made no preparations at all \nto deal with terrorists. \"They don't play\u0014\n                      bingo, they play chess,\" says Gary Slutkin, a \nprofessor of international health at the\u0014\n                      University of Illinois-Chicago. \"What we need \nto do on the public-health side is\u0014\n                      anticipate the next move. We have to be five to \n10 moves in advance.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With Susan Brink, David E.

    "title": "IRVING BERLIN'S ANTHEM CAPTURES AMERICA",
    "words": "Christian History Corner: God Bless, More or \nLess\u0014\n                      Irving Berlin's anthem captures America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Elesha Coffman | posted 11/02/01\u0014\n                      Almost immediately after Irving Berlin finished \n\"God Bless America,\" on\u0014\n                      November 2, 1938, the song threatened to \nreplace \"The Star-Spangled\u0014\n                      Banner\" as the country's top patriotic song. In \nrecent weeks, \"God Bless\u0014\n                      America\" has once again become our unofficial \nnational anthem, sung on\u0014\n                      the Capitol steps, on the floor of the stock \nexchange, even during the\u0014\n                      seventh-inning stretch. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At first glance, it seems strange that a song \nbeginning with the\u0014\n                      contentious word \"God\" can get broad and \nheartfelt endorsement in our\u0014\n                      pluralistic society. Yet \"God Bless America\" is \nthe ideal song of this\u0014\n                      cultural moment for at least four reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      1. \"God Bless America\" isn't really about God.\u0014\n                      The God in this song blesses and guides, and he \nhas a special place in\u0014\n                      his heart for America. He makes no specific \ndemands and picks no\u0014\n                      favorites. That pretty well describes the deity \nof the American majority.\u0014\n                      While 95 percent of Americans believe in God, \naccording to a 1997 Barna\u0014\n                      survey, 53 percent believe that all good people \ngo to heaven, and fewer\u0014\n                      than half believe in moral absolutes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Considering that Irving Berlin was a Jew who \nmarried a Roman Catholic\u0014\n                      and raised three daughters as Protestants, this \nlack of theological\u0014\n                      specificity is understandable. Besides, Berlin \noriginally wrote the song for\u0014\n                      his World War I-era musical \"Yip, Yip, \nYaphank,\" which was hardly the\u0014\n                      setting for doctrinal explication. (Berlin \neventually decided that \"God Bless\u0014\n                      America\" was too serious for the musical, so he \nheld it for 20 years.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. \"God Bless America\" isn't about war.\u0014\n                      President Bush recently said, \"This nation is \npeaceful, but fierce when\u0014\n                      stirred to anger.\" Both qualities have been \nevident in our rhetoric and our\u0014\n                      foreign policy over the years, but most of our \npatriotic songs emphasize\u0014\n                      only the latter. \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" a \nproduct of the War of 1812,\u0014\n                      has rockets glaring and bombs bursting. \"The \nBattle Hymn of the\u0014\n                      Republic,\" written during the Civil War, offers \nup grapes of wrath, a terrible\u0014\n                      swift sword, and that pointed abolitionist \nreference, \"let us die to make\u0014\n                      men free.\" \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" and \"The \nMarines Song\" cover similar\u0014\n                      ground. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now that actual bombs are bursting, however, \nAmericans don't want to\u0014\n                      think about them. They didn't want to think \nabout war in 1938, either, when\u0014\n                      the United States was trying hard not to get \npulled into World War II.\u0014\n                      Berlin (the songwriter, not the regime) \nunderstood this. Even while the\u0014\n                      United States was engaged in the conflict, his \nsongsof which \"This Is\u0014\n                      the Army, Mr. Jones\" is the most \nfamousreflected the ambivalence\u0014\n                      about warfare that would intensify in Korea, \nVietnam, and beyond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      3. \"God Bless America\" isn't triumphalistic.\u0014\n                      Though over 90 percent of Americans think their \ncountry is the best on\u0014\n                      earth, it's uncouth for them to come right out \nand say that. Fortunately,\u0014\n                      \"God Bless America\" speaks only of the nation's \ntopography and its\u0014\n                      identity as \"home sweet home,\" not of manifest \ndestiny, political prowess,\u0014\n                      or the \"beacon on a hill\" mentality of the \nPuritans and their heirs. By\u0014\n                      contrast \"America,\" the only other major \npatriotic song that doesn't dwell\u0014\n                      on war, starts with \"the pilgrims' pride,\" \nextols the benefits of American\u0014\n                      education, gives a nod to the smiling \"stars of \nprogress,\" and claims the\u0014\n                      \"birthright of our sires.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even if \"God Bless America\" boasted as many \nverses as \"America\"\u0014\n                      (eight), Berlin probably would not have \nmentioned pilgrims or birthrights.\u0014\n                      Berlin, after all, was a poor immigrant from \nRussia. After his father's early\u0014\n                      death, he literally sang for his supper on the \nstreets of New York's Lower\u0014\n                      East Side. The United States was his beloved \nadopted home, as it is for\u0014\n                      millions today.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      4. \"God Bless America\" isn't about money.\u0014\n                      In other years, the song of the American moment \nwould be a product of\u0014\n                      Hollywood or Madison Avenue, because \ncommercialized entertainment is\u0014\n                      one of our hottest exports. Even now, it's \nnoteworthy that Berlin was a\u0014\n                      popular balladeer instead of, say, an Episcopal \nSunday-school\u0014\n                      administrator (Francis Scott Key, \n\"Star-Spangled Banner\") or a Unitarian\u0014\n                      social reformer (Julia Ward Howe, \"Battle Hymn \nof the Republic\"). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That said, at a time when Americans are amazing \neach otherand the\u0014\n                      worldwith their charitable donations, selfless \nservice, and can-do spirit,\u0014\n                      \"God Bless America\" is especially appropriate. \nBerlin donated the\u0014\n                      royalties of the song, worth millions, to the \nBoy and Girl Scouts. He\u0014\n                      donated $10 million raised by the musical \"This \nIs the Army, Mr. Jones\" to\u0014\n                      the Army Emergency Relief. For these and other \ncontributions he received\u0014\n                      the Army's Medal of Merit from President Truman \nin 1945, a Congressional\u0014\n                      Gold Medal from President Eisenhower in 1955, \nand the Freedom Medal\u0014\n                      from President Ford in 1977.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Berlin died in 1989 at age 101. He surely would \nhave been gratified to see\u0014\n                      the role \"God Bless America\" is playing in \n2001. Christians seeking deep\u0014\n                      solace in this time of fear, however, would \nfind greater blessings in songs\u0014\n                      with more God and less America.

He separated \nfact from fiction in a People\u0014\n                      interview.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Berlin's obituary, The Guardian wrote that \nwhile \"White Christmas\"\u0014\n                      made him the most money, \"God Bless America\" \nwas the closest to him\u0014\n                      emotionally.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After Congress sang \"God Bless America,\" the \nChristianity Today music\u0014\n                      channel compiled recent CCM song lyrics which \nalso provide comfort to\u0014\n                      Christians after September 11.\u0014",

It can't bug a \ntelephone or crack\u0014\nan enemy code. But even so, its intelligence service is murderously\u0014\neffective--both inside Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan, where \nTaliban\u0014\nspies are suspected of having carried out several assassinations in \nthe past\u0014\ntwo years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Taliban is strongest where U.S. intelligence is weakest: in the \nbazaars, mosques and teahouses of Afghanistan. It has thousands of \ninformers inherited from KHAD--the feared secret police of the former \nAfghan communist regime--working alongside Muslim clerics in nearly \nevery Afghan village. And it has no monolithic central headquarters \nthat can be taken out with a missile.\u0014\n\"The Taliban's command-and-control center,\" says a foreign diplomat, \n\"is two mullahs sitting on\u0014\na rug with a radio transmitter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this shadowy war, the Taliban's intelligence chief, Qari \nAhmadullah, has scored some\u0014\nimpressive hits. His biggest coup: catching Abdul Haq, 43, the \nPashtun commander who slipped\u0014\ninto Afghanistan two weeks ago to lay the groundwork for a revolt \nagainst the Taliban. Afghan sources tell TIME that Taliban spies \ndangled a juicy piece of bait in front of Haq: several regional \nTaliban commanders were ready to defect.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a trap. As soon as Haq crossed over the mountains on horseback \ninto Logar province, he\u0014\nwas tailed by Taliban operatives who captured him on Oct. 21 and, \nafter hours of interrogation,\u0014\nshot him and two of his comrades. Six of Haq's men are still under \narrest, along with 20 other\u0014\nsupporters--dousing U.S. and Pakistani hopes of an uprising among the \ncountry's Pashtun\u0014\ntribesmen. Haq's execution, says a foreign diplomat in Islamabad, \n\"will make any tribal\u0014\nchieftain hesitate before turning against the Taliban.\" Ahmadullah \ncouldn't hide his glee. In a\u0014\nsatellite-telephone interview with a Peshawar journalist, he exulted, \n\"Anyone who tries to enter\u0014\nAfghanistan will meet the same fate as Abdul Haq.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe threat is aimed at another pro-Western Afghan, Hamad Karzai, a \nsupporter of exiled King Mohammed Zahir Shah. Karzai has been on the \nrun in Afghanistan for weeks, dodging Taliban bullets in the Uruzgan \nmountains north of Kandahar. Urbane, well educated and hailing from \nan aristocratic Pashtun family, Karzai is Washington's best--and \nperhaps only--chance to win over the southern tribes. If he can stay \nalive.\u0014\n\u0014\nKarzai's foray into Afghanistan was more discreet than Haq's. On Oct. \n8, Karzai\u0014\nspread word that he was traveling to Rome to confer with the aging \nKing.\u0014\nInstead, Karzai and a group of armed and loyal tribesmen grabbed a \nsat-phone\u0014\nand headed into southwest Afghanistan, the Taliban stronghold. For \nweeks,\u0014\nKarzai met with tribal elders, probing what success an insurrection \nbacked by\u0014\nU.S. firepower might have against Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Karzai \neluded\u0014\nthe Taliban until last week, when its network of spies picked up his \nmovements\u0014\nalong the mountain trails of Uruzgan. On Thursday, Karzai and his men \nblasted\u0014\ntheir way clear of a Taliban ambush--after calling in U.S. \nhelicopters, according\u0014\nto a Taliban spokesman. (The Pentagon said U.S. aircraft were sent to \nhelp.)\u0014\nThe Taliban also claims it seized an airdrop of 600 AK-47 rifles \nmeant for\u0014\nKarzai. The regime insisted that he had been \"under siege\" and was \nairlifted\u0014\nout of Afghanistan on Saturday. But in a call later that day to his \nfamily in\u0014\nQuetta, Karzai said he was safe and still in Afghanistan.\u0014\n\u0014\nAhmadullah is one of Omar's most trusted men. A mullah from the \nsouthern city\u0014\nof Ghanzi, he was a military commander with a string of conquests \nbefore Omar\u0014\nanointed him head of intelligence. He is one of the cooler heads in \nthe ruling\u0014\nTaliban council. Relief workers who dealt with him as governor of the \nnorthern\u0014\nTakhar province say Ahmadullah allowed food convoys into famine-struck\u0014\nareas held by the Northern Alliance, knowing that full stomachs might \nearn\u0014\nsome gratitude beyond enemy lines. \u0014\n\u0014\nWithin Afghanistan, Ahmadullah's men uncovered two plots in \nMazar-i-Sharif by\u0014\ncommanders to overthrow the Taliban. The security services also \ndiscovered a\u0014\nband of opposition bombers in Kabul. Death was swift in both cases. \nThe\u0014\naccused were strung up at a crossroads in warning to all who would \ndefy the\u0014\nTaliban.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Taliban's reach extends into Pakistan. Haq accused the Taliban of\u0014\nmurdering his wife and son in 1999 at their Peshawar home. Karzai \nsuspects\u0014\nthe Taliban of assassinating his father, a noted Afghan \nparliamentarian, in\u0014\nQuetta two years ago. Pakistan's military intelligence, known as the \nisi, has long\u0014\naided the Taliban--and, sources say, some agents are doing so still. \n\"You're\u0014\nasking the isi to change loyalties at the flick of a switch. It's not \nthat easy,\" says\u0014\nan Arab diplomat.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan the Taliban's spy network be beaten? Many Afghans say they're \nwilling to\u0014\ntry. Says one Western diplomat in Peshawar: \"They're lining up, \nsaying, 'Give\u0014\nus money and sat-phones and we'll deliver bin Laden and Mullah Omar.' \nBut it's\u0014\na long way before those promises come true.\"\u0014",

And indeed we should \nhear\u0014\n                      itespecially those of us whose ministry it is \nto teach, coach, or\u0014\n                      counsel them. As many have pointed out, the \nworld our kids live\u0014\n                      in is more confusing, complex, and hard-edged \nthan older folk\u0014\n                      imagine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But, and I seem to hear this reminder less \nfrequently these days,\u0014\n                      they also need to hear what we have to say\"we\" \nbeing their\u0014\n                      elders. The ancient and venerable concept of \nthe \"elder\" has\u0014\n                      shrunk to something as pathetically vestigial \nin American\u0014\n                      churches as in American culture. The elders of \nthe tribe who\u0014\n                      sent young men on vision quests and guided \nyoung women\u0014\n                      through rites of passage, the councils of \nelders in traditional\u0014\n                      cultures who gathered to pool their collective \nwisdom, the elders\u0014\n                      of the early church who oversaw and guarded the \nteaching\u0014\n                      ministries of the community and safeguarded \ndoctrine and\u0014\n                      discipline, and even the mannerly notion of \n\"respect for elders\"\u0014\n                      that once automatically prompted young people \nto rise and offer\u0014\n                      their seats to the white of hair, have receded \ninto remote\u0014\n                      memory. They have been displaced by the \nubiquitous cultural\u0014\n                      icons of smooth-skinned, athletic, exuberant \nyouth as arbiters of\u0014\n                      taste, executors of social and economic power, \nand often critics\u0014\n                      of their parents' folly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There's a reason why the commandment to \"Honor \nyour father\u0014\n                      and your mother\" is not reciprocal. Respect, \nhonor, obedience,\u0014\n                      and reverence are not owed to children in the \nway children owe\u0014\n                      these things to their elders. The job of elders \nis to care for,\u0014\n                      counsel, guide, protect, teach, encourage, and \nenable the\u0014\n                      youth. But when, on some false egalitarian \npremise, elders fail to\u0014\n                      claim the respect and honor due them, when they \ngive away\u0014\n                      their authority and concede the floor to the \nkids, they do both\u0014\n                      themselves and the young people they care about \na serious\u0014\n                      disservice. In functional cultures and \nfunctional families, children\u0014\n                      don't need to challenge their parents' place \nbecause they are\u0014\n                      secure in their own, and elders don't need to \ncourt or coax\u0014\n                      young people because they are secure in the \nlegitimacy of their\u0014\n                      authority. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      We get no help from popular culture in \nmaintaining respect for\u0014\n                      elders. \"Ageism\" abounds. Few of the older \npeople who make a\u0014\n                      rare appearance in film are wisdom figures. \n\"Little old ladies\"\u0014\n                      who feed the birds, be whiskered and benevolent \ngrandpa\u0014\n                      prototypes, or curt and curmudgeonly old \nneighbors serve as\u0014\n                      foils in their amusing or pathetic irrelevancy \nfor the presumably\u0014\n                      more interesting escapades of \"the youth.\" \nThere are\u0014\n                      exceptions, of courseAlec Guinness as Obi Wan \nKenobi, for\u0014\n                      instance, or Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank\u0014\n                      Redemptionbut as exceptions they serve most ly \nto prove the\u0014\n                      rule: old is not interesting. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      My grandmother wouldn't have stood for such \nfoolishness. I\u0014\n                      don't think it occurred to her as she held \ncourt among laughing\u0014\n                      visitors, interviewed my boyfriends, or \nreminisced or opined at\u0014\n                      the dinner table that she didn't have a natural \nedge on the\u0014\n                      younger lot by dint of her many years of \nteaching, trailing my\u0014\n                      wandering grandfather around the country, \nsurviving three wars,\u0014\n                      a depression, relative poverty, and the social \nupheavals of the\u0014\n                      '60s without losing faith in God or her own \nresilient self. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Her sense of humor helped. She did not suffer \nfools gladly, or\u0014\n                      tolerate incorrect grammar or slovenly habits. \nShe expected to\u0014\n                      be greeted when she entered the room, and taken \nleave of\u0014\n                      properly. She taught me to read when I was 4, \nto recite the 23rd\u0014\n                      Psalm, to shell peas and peel apples, and to \nlaugh over the\u0014\n                      catalogue of human foibles in Winnie-the-Pooh. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      She also served as one of four adults in our \nthree-generation\u0014\n                      household who together provided safe space and \nboundaries\u0014\n                      for my brother and me as we grew up. Sometimes \nall that adult\u0014\n                      correction and scrutiny seemed burdensome. More \noften it\u0014\n                      provided us with usable models of \nproblem-solving, relationship\u0014\n                      maintenance, and worthwhile conversation. What \nwe had to say\u0014\n                      at the dinner table was heard and taken \nseriously, but we were\u0014\n                      never led to believe that what we had to say \nwas necessarily of\u0014\n                      equal value to the more informed, seasoned, or \nnuanced\u0014\n                      reflections of our elders. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      However I felt about this at the time, I \nremember that circle of\u0014\n                      elders gratefully, and not, I think, from \nsimple nostalgia. I am\u0014\n                      grateful for the salutary humility that arose \nfrom an awareness\u0014\n                      that I had much to learn, for the security that \ncame from kindly\u0014\n                      correction, and the ability to distinguish \nauthentic respect from\u0014\n                      the nervous concessions of adults who traded \ntheir authority for\u0014\n                      the grudg ing acceptance of the young. When my \nown life\u0014\n                      moved me into parenthood, I found myself \nrepeatedly appalled\u0014\n                      at how frequently parents I knew seemed unable \nto set limits,\u0014\n                      say no, or hold the attention of children whose \ndemands seemed\u0014\n                      to frighten and bewilder them. The church can \nhelp with this\u0014\n                      failure of authority. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the many gifts we need from one another \nin the body of\u0014\n                      Christ is a village to help raise the child. \nOur kids don't need us\u0014\n                      to shower them with false praise, to donate \npulpit time so they\u0014\n                      can tell us how camp was \"really, like, \nincredible,\" to dignify\u0014\n                      every unschooled utterance with applause. They \nneed elders\u0014\n                      who will tell their stories, communicate, and \ndemand respect,\u0014\n                      give them something to rise to, offer \ncompassionate correction,\u0014\n                      and laugh at the inflations of the immature. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Elders who have received and reflected on the \ngift of life with all\u0014\n                      its hard edges are in possession of something \nprecious that\u0014\n                      needs and deserves to be sharedelders like the \nwoman at a\u0014\n                      prayer retreat I once attended who, when asked \nto consider\u0014\n                      what might be her gifts to the community, \npondered silently for a\u0014\n                      minute and then responded, \"I've been through \nthings.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It may be that one of the best things the \nchurch can offer its\u0014\n                      youth is the active and assertive presence of \nthose who have\u0014\n                      gone before them, been through things, and are \nwilling both to\u0014\n                      share and to listen, but not, in false \nkindness, to abdicate the\u0014\n                      authority that gives value to the gift they \nbring. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marilyn Chandler McEntyre is a professor of \nEnglish Department at\u0014\n                      Westmont College.\u0014",

    "title": "I DANCED IN THE MORNING",
    "words": "I danced in the morning\u0014\n\u0014\n     I danced in the morning when the world was begun,\u0014\n     And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,\u0014\n     And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth;\u0014\n     at Bethlehem I had my birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is one of a relatively few modern hymns (perhaps more \nappropriately called a song) which has been taken up widely \nthroughout the Christian Church. It was written in 1963 under the \ntitle Lord of the Dance by Sydney Carter (b. 1915). Carter was \neducated at Christ's Hospital and Balliol College, Oxford, and served \nin the Friends' Ambulance Unit in the Middle East and Greece during \nthe Second World War. After some teaching he became a freelance \nwriter and broadcaster. He is quoted as saying \"nearly everything \nthat I am doing now goes back in one way or another to the time I \nspent in Greece\". The songs of Sydney Carter live a double life. Lord \nof the Dance is sung like a hymn in church, and in another way in a \nfolk club. Carter describes it as a carol - \"a dancing kind of song, \nthe life of which is in the dance as much as in the verbal statement. \nCarols are often, but not always, seasonal. They can be pagan, \nChristian, or both\".\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book Green Print for Song (1974), Carter writes as follows: \n\"Scriptures and\u0014\ncreeds may come to seem incredible, but faith will still go dancing \non. I see Christ\u0014\nas the incarnation of that piper who is calling us. He dances that \nshape and\u0014\npattern which is at the heart of our reality. By Christ I mean not \nonly Jesus - in\u0014\nother times and places, other planets, there may be other Lords of \nthe Dance. But\u0014\nJesus is the one I know first and best. I sing of the dancing pattern \nin the life and\u0014\nwords of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words of the hymn take the form of an approachable narrative of \nChrist's\u0014\nministry. Dancing for the scribe, the pharisee, for James and John, \non the\u0014\nSabbath, on a Friday, and so on.

The Shakers, whose \norigins were in\u0014\na 1774 emigrant Manchester Quaker community, kept largely celibate \nlives. When\u0014\nthey met they expressed their joyful assurance of salvation and \nbelief in the\u0014\nimminence of Christ's second coming by singing and dancing.

How could these terrorists \ninvoke God's mercifulness\u0014\n                      and compassion when they had, through their \nevil act, put to shame\u0014\n                      the entire history of this great religion and \nits culture of toleration?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Every judgment about Islam, all reaction to \nMuslim doctrine, and each\u0014\n                      Muslim-Christian encounter are now cast in \nlight of the events of that\u0014\n                      dreadful day.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Islam as a Path of Peace\u0014\n                      There are three distinct interpretations of the \nevents of September 11.\u0014\n                      The first view is that the terrorist acts do \nnot represent Islam.\u0014\n                      President George W. Bush best expressed this \nnotion when he said\u0014\n                      that \"Islam is a religion of peace.\" One of the \nleading Muslims to echo\u0014\n                      this is Yusuf Islam (the former rock musician \nCat Stevens, who now\u0014\n                      helps promote Muslim education in England). \n\"Today, I am aghast at\u0014\n                      the horror of recent events and feel it a duty \nto speak out,\" he said in a\u0014\n                      London newspaper. \"Not only did terrorists \nhijack planes and destroy\u0014\n                      life; they also hijacked the beautiful religion \nof Islam.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During an interfaith ceremony at Yankee Stadium \non September 23,\u0014\n                      Imam Izak-El M.

They are no believers in God \nat all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Major Muslim organizations throughout North \nAmerica, including the\u0014\n                      Council on American-Islamic Relations, the \nIslamic Society of North\u0014\n                      America, and the Muslim Students Association, \ndenounced the work\u0014\n                      of the terrorists. The powerful American Muslim \nCouncil issued a\u0014\n                      press release on September 11, saying it \n\"strongly condemns this\u0014\n                      morning's plane attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon\u0014\n                      and expresses deep sorrow for Americans that \nwere injured and killed.\u0014\n                      amc sends out its condolences to all the \nfamilies of the victims of this\u0014\n                      cowardly terrorist attack.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With the exception of Iraq, Muslim nations \ndistanced themselves from\u0014\n                      the attack on America. \"Iran has vehemently \ncondemned the suicidal\u0014\n                      terrorist attacks in the United States,\" Iran \nToday reported in a\u0014\n                      front-page story on September 24, \"and has \nexpressed its deep\u0014\n                      sorrow and sympathy with the American nation.\" \nThe governments of\u0014\n                      Bahrain, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, \nPalestine, Qatar, Saudi\u0014\n                      Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen \nexpressed similar\u0014\n                      sentiments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Leading intellectuals, who have argued that \nterrorist acts represent\u0014\n                      only fringe Muslims, have also promoted the \nview that Islam is a\u0014\n                      religion of peace. Edward Said, the \ncontroversial Columbia University\u0014\n                      professor, argued in The Nation that September \n11 is an act of cultic\u0014\n                      religion. Comparing Islamists to the Branch \nDavidians and the Rev.\u0014\n                      Jim Jones, he said September 11 is a model of \n\"the carefully planned\u0014\n                      and horrendous, pathologically motivated \nsuicide attack and mass\u0014\n                      slaughter by a small group of deranged \nmilitants.the capture of big\u0014\n                      ideas by a tiny band of crazed fanatics for \ncriminal purposes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mark Juergensmeyer, professor at the University \nof California at Santa\u0014\n                      Barbara and a specialist on religious violence, \nput it similarly: \"Osama\u0014\n                      bin Laden is to Islam [what] Timothy McVeigh is \nto Christianity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Darker Side\u0014\n                      After initial emphasis on Islam as a religion \nof peace, a second\u0014\n                      interpretation came to the fore. Editorials \nstarted to emerge that were\u0014\n                      less optimistic about Islam per se and far more \nalarmed about the\u0014\n                      scope and depth of militant Islam. Novelist \nSalman Rushdie, on whom\u0014\n                      the late Ayatollah Khomeini once issued a death \norder, wrote in The\u0014\n                      New York Times:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           If this isn't about Islam, why the \nworldwide Muslim\u0014\n                           demonstrations in support of Osama bin \nLaden and Al\u0014\n                           Qaeda?

Rick Bragg\u0014\n                      reported in The New York Times about Muslim \nboys running through\u0014\n                      their school compounds in Pakistan on September \n11. They were\u0014\n                      \"celebrating, stabbing the fingers on one hand \ninto the palm of the\u0014\n                      other, to simulate a plane stabbing into a \nbuilding.\" Palestinian\u0014\n                      authorities went into overdrive to suppress \nimages of youths\u0014\n                      celebrating the deaths in America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      September 11 as Islam\u0014\n                      There is, finally, the view that September 11 \nrepresents authentic\u0014\n                      Islam, a notion adopted by Osama bin Laden and \nhis many followers.\u0014\n                      His revolutionary zeal lacks no clarity. \"The \nruling to kill the Americans\u0014\n                      and their alliescivilians and militaryis an \nindividual duty for every\u0014\n                      Muslim who can do it in any country in which it \nis possible to do it,\"\u0014\n                      he said in February 1998. Muslim extremists \nfrom Bangladesh, Egypt,\u0014\n                      and Pakistan also signed this fatwa, titled \n\"Urging Jihad Against\u0014\n                      Americans.\" Bin Laden told ABC News producer \nRahimullah\u0014\n                      Yousafsai last winter that he would kill his \nown children, if it were\u0014\n                      necessary, to hit American targets.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ironically, some Christian writers have also \nadvanced the view that\u0014\n                      September 11 represents true Islam. Of these, \nthe most influential is\u0014\n                      Robert A. Morey, the popular evangelical \ncult-watcher, who in recent\u0014\n                      years has targeted Islam as a deadly religion. \nAuthor of The Islamic\u0014\n                      Invasion, Morey has often debated leading \nMuslim apologists, in fiery\u0014\n                      exchanges that have led to mob attacks on him \nand repeated calls for\u0014\n                      his death. Morey has accused Muhammad of being \na racist, a\u0014\n                      murderer, an irrational zealot, and a \npedophile. After September 11,\u0014\n                      Morey announced a spiritual crusade against \nIslam, and invited\u0014\n                      Christians to sign this pledge:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           In response to the Muslim Holy War now \nbeing waged\u0014\n                           against us, We, the undersigned, following \nthe example\u0014\n                           of the Christian Church since the 7th \ncentury, do commit\u0014\n                           ourselves, our wealth, and our families to \njoin in a Holy\u0014\n                           Crusade to fight against Islam and its \nfalse god, false\u0014\n                           prophet, and false book. We, the \nundersigned, believe\u0014\n                           that Islam is the root of all Muslim \nterrorism, which is\u0014\n                           the fruit of Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christian scholars have criticized Morey for \nhis invective, but he\u0014\n                      remains unmoved. He has argued that Muslims \nwill start World War III.\u0014\n                      On his Web site, Morey invites Christians to \nfill in a \"certificate of\u0014\n                      valor\" that reads, \"I wish to join in the \nCrusade of Christ against Islam.\u0014\n                      To that end, and to demonstrate in the crusade \nagainst Islam, I hereby\u0014\n                      donate toward emergency wartime funds.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Rise of the Militants\u0014\n                      Sorting through these three interpretations \ndemands analysis of some\u0014\n                      deeper issues. First, we must come to grips \nwith the vast unrest in the\u0014\n                      Islamic world, both now and over the last two \ncenturies. There has\u0014\n                      been a growing radicalization in Islam since \nthe early 1800s, both in\u0014\n                      response to the spread of Western colonialism \nand the demise of\u0014\n                      Muslim political supremacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden traces his radicalism to the \nWahhabism of his\u0014\n                      native Saudi Arabia, a movement that began with \nthe reformer\u0014\n                      Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab (170387), an \nadvocate of a\u0014\n                      puritanical reading of Islamic law and belief. \nThe Wahhabis threatened\u0014\n                      the interests of the Ottoman Turks and, in \nconcert with the Saud\u0014\n                      dynasty, eventually gained control of Mecca and \nMedina, Islam's\u0014\n                      holiest cities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A fundamentalist thrust in Islam emerged in \nEgypt as well, with the\u0014\n                      formation of the Muslim Brotherhood (also known \nas Al-Ikhwan\u0014\n                      al-Muslimun) in 1927. Tormented first by the \npresence of British rule\u0014\n                      and then by a tepid Muslim government, \nbrotherhood founder Hassan\u0014\n                      al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb, his chief \nintellectual heir, sought by any\u0014\n                      means, including violence, to restore true \nIslamic rule to Egypt.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The brotherhood started branches in Jordan and \nSyria, and militant\u0014\n                      groups in India, Iran, and Iraq imitated its \nradicalism. Muhammad\u0014\n                      Nawab-Safavi started his Fedayeen-e-Islami \nmovement in Iran in the\u0014\n                      1930s and told his followers: \"Throw away your \nbeads and get a gun:\u0014\n                      for beads keep you silent whilst guns silence \nthe enemies of Islam.\"\u0014\n                      Abul A'la Maududi organized his militant \nJamaat-e-Islami in the Punjab\u0014\n                      in 1941. After the creation of Pakistan in \n1947, Maududi tried\u0014\n                      repeatedly to convince the government to adopt \nhis stricter version of\u0014\n                      Islamic rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Western awareness of militant Islam came with \nthe radical overthrow\u0014\n                      of the Shah of Iran in 1979 and the \nestablishment of harsh Shari'ah law\u0014\n                      under the Ayatollah Khomeini. American exposure \nto Islamic\u0014\n                      fundamentalism came with the arrest of \nAmericans in Tehran, the\u0014\n                      bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, the \nexplosions at U.S.\u0014\n                      embassies in Africa, the attack on the USS Cole \nin Yemen, and then\u0014\n                      the horrors of September 11.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Interpreting Jihad\u0014\n                      Every discussion of Islamic militancy turns \neventually to two\u0014\n                      fundamental concerns. First, how much is \nIslamism (that practiced by\u0014\n                      fundamentalist Muslims open to violence) rooted \nin the teaching and\u0014\n                      practice of the prophet Muhammad? Would he \ncelebrate the work of\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden? Second, are the violent jihads \nof our day\u0014\n                      sanctioned by the Qur'an and by the actions of \nearly Muslim leaders?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The prophet himself engaged in many military \nbattles and could be\u0014\n                      merciless to his enemies, even those who simply \nattacked him\u0014\n                      verbally. His original sympathies with Jews and \nChristians as \"Peoples\u0014\n                      of the Book\" gave way to a harsher treatment \nwhen they did not follow\u0014\n                      Islam. In one infamous episode, Muhammad cut \nthe heads off\u0014\n                      hundreds of Jewish males of the Beni Quraiza \ntribe who did not side\u0014\n                      with him in battle. The prophet is quoted as \nsaying, \"The sword is the\u0014\n                      key of heaven and hell; a drop of blood shed in \nthe cause of Allah, a\u0014\n                      night spent in arms, is of more avail than two \nmonths of fasting or\u0014\n                      prayer: whosoever falls in battle, his sins are \nforgiven, and at the day\u0014\n                      of judgment his limbs shall be supplied by the \nwings of angels and\u0014\n                      cherubim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In reference to the Qur'an, many have drawn \nattention to the famous\u0014\n                      passage in Surah 2:256: \"Let there be no \ncompulsion in religion.\" This\u0014\n                      verse fits well with other Qur'an verses in \nwhich jihad means personal\u0014\n                      and communal spiritual struggle or striving. \nBut the Qur'an also uses\u0014\n                      jihad to mean \"holy war,\" and the language can \nbe extreme. Surah\u0014\n                      5:33 reads, \"The punishment of those who wage \nwar against God and\u0014\n                      His Messenger, and strive with might and main \nfor mischief through\u0014\n                      the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or \ncutting off of hands and feet\u0014\n                      from opposite sides, or exile from the land: \nthat is their disgrace in this\u0014\n                      world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the \nHereafter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both the example of the prophet and some \nemphases in the Qur'an\u0014\n                      provided warrant for Islam's earliest leaders \nto spread Islam by military\u0014\n                      conquest. Bloody expansionism was also \njustified through original\u0014\n                      Islamic law that divided the world into two \nrealms: Dar al-Harb (the\u0014\n                      land of war) and Dar al-Islam (land under \nIslamic rule). Both Paul\u0014\n                      Fregosi's Jihad in the West and Jewish scholar \nBat Ye'or's Decline of\u0014\n                      Eastern Christianity Under Islam document the \nreality of Muslim\u0014\n                      crusades long before the notorious Christian \ncrusades of the Middle\u0014\n                      Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Out of the vortex of these realities emerge two \ndifferent perspectives\u0014\n                      among modern Muslims. Islamists consider their \nactions a true jihad\u0014\n                      or \"holy war\" against infidels and the enemies \nof Islam. They believe it\u0014\n                      is right to target America, \"the great Satan.\" \nOsama bin Laden\u0014\n                      believes that the Qur'an supports his campaign, \nthat the prophet would\u0014\n                      bless his cause, and that Allah is on his side. \nBut the vast majority of\u0014\n                      Muslims believe that nothing in Muhammad's life \nor in the Qur'an or\u0014\n                      Islamic law justifies terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bernard Lewis, the great historian of Islam, \nnoted in The Wall Street\u0014\n                      Journal that throughout history, Muslims have \ngiven jihad both spiritual\u0014\n                      and military meaning. Lewis also pays \nparticular attention to the legal\u0014\n                      traditions in Islam about what constitutes just \nwar. After noting the\u0014\n                      many limitations placed on military jihad, he \nwrites, \"What the\u0014\n                      classical jurists of Islam never remotely \nconsidered is the kind of\u0014\n                      unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of \nuninvolved civil\u0014\n                      populations that we saw in New York. For this \nthere is no precedent\u0014\n                      and no authority in Islam.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The Clash of Civilizations,\" Samuel \nHuntington's essay for Foreign\u0014\n                      Affairs (Summer 1993), has attracted \nconsiderable attention in recent\u0014\n                      months. Writing just after the Gulf War, \nHuntington analyzed the\u0014\n                      competing ideologies of our time and drew \nparticular attention to the\u0014\n                      clash between Islam and the West. His concern \nhas obvious merit,\u0014\n                      although critics have made a crucial point that \nIslam is no monolith.\u0014\n                      There are clashes within Islamic civilization \nitself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What may emerge as the most significant factor \nin the current shape\u0014\n                      of our world, then, is not the clash between \nIslam and the West. It is,\u0014\n                      instead, the clash between Muslims as they try \nto define their faith for\u0014\n                      the 21st century. Islam clearly does not speak \nwith one voice. It\u0014\n                      shows nearly as much diversity as does \nChristianity (see \"A Many\u0014\n                      Splintered Thing\"). The debate within Islam \nwill be protracted,\u0014\n                      regardless of how long military campaigns \ncontinue against any\u0014\n                      Islamist movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Troubles in Palestine\u0014\n                      The Palestinian question has also fueled the \ngrowth of Islamic\u0014\n                      militancy. Tensions in Palestine between \nMuslims and Jews date\u0014\n                      back to the first wave of Jewish \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nin the late 1800s. The\u0014\n                      British government's 1917 Balfour Declaration \nheightened Arab unrest,\u0014\n                      as did the United Nations' support for a Jewish \nstate 30 years later,\u0014\n                      leading to the formation of the State of Israel \nin May 1948.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Five wars between Arabs and Jews since Israel's \nformation create the\u0014\n                      context for modern Muslim-Jewish hostilities. \nThese tensions\u0014\n                      increased with the rise of the first Intifadah \n(\"uprising\") in 1987, and a\u0014\n                      second Intifadah in 2000, following the \nbreakdown of talks at Camp\u0014\n                      David between Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Barak.\u0014\n                      Islamic militant groups like Hamas and \nHizbollah call for an armed\u0014\n                      jihad against Israel. Many Palestinian Muslims \ncelebrate the attack on\u0014\n                      America but also claim it was really the work \nof the CIA and Israel's\u0014\n                      Mossad.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the mix of all this turmoil is the seemingly \nendless cycle of violence\u0014\n                      in Israel and Palestine. Here are just five \nexamples of terrorist acts\u0014\n                      against Israelis in the year before September \n11:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      August 12A suicide bombing at a caf in Kiryat \nMotzkin wounded\u0014\n                      21.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      August 9A bombing at a pizza place in \nJerusalem killed 15,\u0014\n                      including 6 children, and injured 80.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      June 1A Palestinian suicide bomber associated \nwith Hamas\u0014\n                      detonated an explosive belt that injured 120 \nand killed 20 at a\u0014\n                      nightclub in Tel Aviv.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      May 9Two 14-year-old Jewish boys were stoned \nto death at a cave\u0014\n                      near their small town of Tekoa, in the West \nBank.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      February 14A Palestinian bus driver plowed \ninto a crowd near\u0014\n                      Tel-Aviv, killing 8.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the other hand, writers as diverse as Noam \nChomsky, Hans Kng,\u0014\n                      Michael Lerner, Edward Said, and David Grossman \n(author of The\u0014\n                      Yellow Wind) argue for recognizing injustices \ndone against\u0014\n                      Palestinians by Israel. They also argue for \nstronger American\u0014\n                      complaints against Israeli settlements in the \nWest Bank and Gaza. In\u0014\n                      the last 15 years, the case for a Palestinian \nstate has grown more\u0014\n                      popular among moderate Jews and many analysts \nsympathetic to\u0014\n                      Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"With or without Islamic fundamentalism, with \nor without Arab\u0014\n                      terrorism, there is no justification whatsoever \nfor the lasting occupation\u0014\n                      and suppression of the Palestinian people by \nIsrael,\" Amos Oz wrote\u0014\n                      in a New York Times editorial. \"We have no \nright to deny Palestinians\u0014\n                      their natural right to self-determination.Two \nhuge oceans could not\u0014\n                      shelter America from terrorism; the occupation \nof the West Bank and\u0014\n                      Gaza by Israel has not made Israel secureon \nthe contrary, it makes\u0014\n                      our self-defense much harder and more \ncomplicated.

Is Islam\u0014\n                      fundamentally opposed to human rights by its \ninherently theocratic\u0014\n                      thrust? Why do Muslim countries have such \ndeplorable records on\u0014\n                      human rights? Data made available by Freedom \nHouse, an\u0014\n                      organization that monitors political and civil \nrights in every country of\u0014\n                      the world, supports this assertion. Of the 41 \ncountries whose\u0014\n                      population is at least 70 percent Muslim, 26 \nare considered not free,\u0014\n                      and 13 are partly free.

Why is it that the government of \nSaudi Arabia welcomed\u0014\n                      Allied Forces to free Kuwait but forbids entry \nof non-Muslims to its\u0014\n                      country? Western governments allow Muslims to \ntalk freely about their\u0014\n                      faith. Why can't Christians do the same in many \nMuslim countries?\u0014\n                      Muslims rightfully express concern about the \ndenial of liberties to\u0014\n                      Palestinians. But are the rights of Jews \nprotected in Indonesia?

The widespread practice of female \ngenital mutilation in\u0014\n                      Muslim countries alone signals the reality of \nwomen's oppression.\u0014\n                      Women are forbidden even to drive a car in \nSaudi Arabia.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Until they were freed suddenly in mid-November, \neight expatriate\u0014\n                      Christians were on trial in Afghanistan on \ncharges of Christian\u0014\n                      evangelism. Followers of Jesus in many Muslim \ncountries can be put\u0014\n                      to death for sharing what they believe. It \nwould be wonderful to know\u0014\n                      that the Muslim leaders who joined President \nBush in public to\u0014\n                      express solidarity against Osama bin Laden were \nalready on record as\u0014\n                      condemning the persecution of these Christians \nin Afghanistan. If not,\u0014\n                      why not?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1999 I had lunch with an American whose \nidentity I must conceal\u0014\n                      lest I place his life in renewed danger. Over \nour meal, he told me of a\u0014\n                      simple but life-altering fact. A few years \nearlier, he realized that he no\u0014\n                      longer believed in Islam, and he abandoned his \nfaith. As a result, he\u0014\n                      received death threatsnot in Sudan, or Libya, \nor Iraq, but in the\u0014\n                      United States. Are American Muslim leaders \ndisturbed that members\u0014\n                      of their communities threaten former Muslims \nwith death? Do\u0014\n                      American Muslims long for adoption of Shari'ah \nlaw, which would\u0014\n                      mandate that Muslims who abandon their faith be \nput to death?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rethinking Islam\u0014\n                      Though many Muslims have tried to blame America \nand Israel for all\u0014\n                      the ills of the Muslim world, a rising number \nof Muslim intellectuals are\u0014\n                      calling for a new and radical self-criticism \nwithin Islam. This point has\u0014\n                      been articulated best by Kanan Makiya, author \nof Republic of Fear (on\u0014\n                      Saddam Hussein's Iraq) and Cruelty and Silence \n(a powerful protest\u0014\n                      against the timidity of Arab intellectuals to \naddress the dark side of\u0014\n                      the militant Islamic Middle East).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Makiya writes in a London Observer article, \n\"Fighting Islam's Ku Klux\u0014\n                      Klan\":\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Arabs and Muslims need today to face up to \nthe fact\u0014\n                           that their resentment at America has long \nsince become\u0014\n                           unmoored from any rational underpinnings \nit might once\u0014\n                           have had; like the anti-Semitism of the \ninterwar years, it\u0014\n                           is today steeped in deeply embedded \nconspiratorial\u0014\n                           patterns of thought rooted in profound \nignorance of how a\u0014\n                           society and a polity like the United \nStates, much less\u0014\n                           Israel, functions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      His article ends with these words:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Muslims and Arabs have to be on the front \nlines of a new\u0014\n                           kind of war, one that is worth waging for \ntheir own\u0014\n                           salvation and in their own souls.

To \nexorcise what they\u0014\n                           have done in our name is the \ncivilizational challenge of\u0014\n                           the twenty-first century for every Arab \nand Muslim in the\u0014\n                           world today.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The events of September 11 have led some \nnon-Muslims to reconsider\u0014\n                      their rhetoric against the United States and \nIsrael. Of most\u0014\n                      significance, here is the Australian activist, \nHelen Darville, author of\u0014\n                      The Hand that Signed the Paper. She writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           I have watched, since that day, the cozy \nleftist pieties of\u0014\n                           my youth disintegrate. Those pieties will \nbe familiar to\u0014\n                           many of you. Chief among them is the old \nsaw that to\u0014\n                           understand horrors, one must be willing to \ncontextualize\u0014\n                           them.

    "words": "Is Islam the Enemy?\u0014\n\u0014\n                       How Christians and Muslims navigate the road \nahead will have profound\u0014\n                       consequences for both communities--and for the \nworld.\u0014\n                       By Charles Kimball\u0014\n\u0014\n In the months since the terrorist bombings of American embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania and the massive\u0014\n U.S. cruise missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan, \nconsiderable media attention has been\u0014\n focused on militant Islam. Exiled Saudi Osama bin Laden has become \nthe new, sinister symbol for violent\u0014\n Islamic extremism. Various political leaders, pundits, and op-ed \nwriters have dubbed him the worlds most\u0014\n dangerous man. Amidst the daily news of presidential scandal, the \nfaltering Russian economy and the\u0014\n McGwire/Sosa home run race, President Clinton and Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright declared war on\u0014\n terrorism. Albright warned that this war will last for years, \nperhaps decades. She even raised the specter of\u0014\n potential terrorist uses of chemical and biological weapons or small \nnuclear devices targeted on domestic\u0014\n and international sites.\u0014\n\u0014\n Terrorism is neither new nor limited to Islamic militants. Images of \nthe federal building in Oklahoma City and\u0014\n bombings in Northern Ireland are etched vividly into our \nconsciousness. But it is certainly true that a number\u0014\n of individuals and groups identifying themselves with Islam have \nperiodically lashed out with violent terrorist\u0014\n actions in Lebanon, Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Algeria, and elsewhere \nin the past three decades.\u0014\n\u0014\n This extremist dimension of contemporary Islam is real, but far from \nrepresentative. It is highly misleading\u0014\n when politicians and journalists speak about an \"Islamic threat\" as \nsome type of monolithic entity. Such\u0014\n stereotypes serve to reinforce popular perceptions of Islam as \nsomehow inherently violent and menacing. In\u0014\n fact, the vast majority of the worlds 1.2 billion Muslims are as \noffended by a violent act carried out in the\u0014\n name of Islam as most Christians are horrified by atrocities \nperpetrated by Serbian Christians or the Real\u0014\n IRA.\u0014\n\u0014\n The facile association of Islam with fanaticism and violence \nconfuses rather than clarifies issues. Clearly,\u0014\n Islam is an increasingly powerful political force in many lands. \nMany countries with predominantly Muslim\u0014\n populations are in the midst of change. Islamist movements are \nactive in the process. Some Muslims\u0014\n seeking change are Sunnis while others are Shiites; some are \nworking within the framework of established\u0014\n political parties; some are operating underground in an effort to \ndisrupt the status quo; some political\u0014\n leaders are cynically using religion to gain support for their \npolicies. \u0014\n\u0014\n During the course of the past 20 years, I have had extraordinary \nopportunities for direct involvement in Middle\u0014\n Eastern affairs. In addition to living in Egypt in 1977-78 and \ntraveling to Iran three times to help facilitate the\u0014\n peaceful resolution of the 1979-81 hostage crisis, I have traveled \nthroughout the Middle East on more than\u0014\n 30 occasions. Much of my involvement has centered on church-related \nministries in Lebanon,\u0014\n Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.\u0014\n\u0014\n One overriding impression derived from these endeavors and my \necumenical work with U.S. churches\u0014\n centers on the pervasive ignorance of and misperceptions about \nIslam. In fairness, both Clinton and Albright\u0014\n have underscored the distinction between terrorists and Islam. While \nlaudable, such rhetorical nuances are\u0014\n lost on most Americans, not to mention Muslims and others abroad \nwhose views are instead shaped by U.S.\u0014\n military actions.\u0014\n\u0014\n Concerted and sustained educational efforts to fill the void are \nneeded now more than ever, for Islam is not\u0014\n only the worlds second largest religious tradition but will soon \npass Judaism as the second largest religion\u0014\n in the United States. It is essential that Christians in the West \nunderstand more accurately some of the\u0014\n fundamental tenets of Islam. Thoughtful study can help clarify \npoints of convergence and disagreement\u0014\n among these descendants of Abraham. It is particularly important \nduring this time of political confusion and\u0014\n upheaval that the churches take the lead in improving understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\n Some Basics of Islam\u0014\n\u0014\n The central message of Islam is lodged in the simple confession of \nfaith: \"There is no God but God, and\u0014\n Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" Islam is a radical monotheism. \nMuslims affirm the one, true God as\u0014\n Creator and Sustainer of the universe whose will has been manifest \nto humankind through prophetic\u0014\n revelation. The final revelation, according to Islamic teaching, \ncame through Muhammad and is now in the\u0014\n Quran (sometimes rendered Koran), which they consider to be the \nliteral, perfect, and complete word of God.\u0014\n Muslims believe the proper human response to this revelation is \nobedience both in the worship of God and\u0014\n in all aspects of life.\u0014\n\u0014\n Muslims worship the same God as Christians and Jews. Many non-Arabic \nspeakers, confused by the name\u0014\n Allah, have not made this connection. Allah is simply the Arabic \nword for God. In the Middle East today, the\u0014\n 12-14 million indigenous Arabic-speaking Christians pray to Allah, \njust as the French pray to Dieu and\u0014\n Germans to Gott. For Muslims there is no ambiguity: the one, true \nGod is the God of Abraham, Moses, Jesus,\u0014\n Muhammad, and everyone else in creation.\u0014\n\u0014\n In 610, at the age of 40, Muhammad had a profound and disturbing \nexperience he understood as a revelation\u0014\n from God mediated by the angel Gabriel. Shaken by the episode, he \ndoubted both his sanity and his\u0014\n worthiness to be Gods prophetic messenger. Encouraged by his wife \nand a few close friends, he came to\u0014\n accept this calling and responsibility. Over a period of the next 23 \nyears, he uttered the messages he\u0014\n perceived as coming from Gabriel.\u0014\n\u0014\n The basic themes in the earliest passages in the Quran include the \nsublime majesty of God, the futility of idol\u0014\n worship, the certainty of Gods judgment, and human responsibility \nfor faith in God and for fair,\u0014\n compassionate behavior in society. Later themes include a variety of \ndoctrinal teachings as well as social\u0014\n and ethical responsibilities in areas such as marriage, divorce, and \ninheritance. Numerous passages\u0014\n address responsibility toward children, the poor, and oppressed, \ncommercial dealings and also prohibitions\u0014\n against criminal behavior such as theft, adultery, and murder.\u0014\n\u0014\n The life of faith begins with the affirmation of Gods oneness. This \nis the first of the five devotional-ritual\u0014\n duties known as the \"pillars of Islam.\" Prescribed prayer is the \nsecond and most conspicuous manifestation\u0014\n of piety. Five times each day, Muslims are called to prayer. The \nworshippers stand in rows of straight lines\u0014\n oriented toward the central sacred site, the Kabah, in Mecca. The \nsymbolic unity of Muslims in prayer reflects\u0014\n the conviction that all people stand equally before God.\u0014\n\u0014\n The three other pillars include almsgiving, fasting during the \ndaylight hours throughout the month of\u0014\n Ramadan, and, at least once in ones lifetime, making the pilgrimage \n(hajj) to Mecca during the time set\u0014\n apart each year for this striking ritual. Woven through these \ndevotional-ritual practices are threads\u0014\n symbolically uniting Muslims as equal members of their community of \nfaith. This does not mean that all is\u0014\n harmonious in the house of Islam. Ask 10 Muslim women in different \ncountries about equality in Islam, for\u0014\n instance, and you will find no consensus.\u0014\n\u0014\n A close look at Islamic history reveals patterns that are common in \nother religious communities: a rich\u0014\n tradition, inspiring people to their highest good, and at the same \ntime one replete with schism, power\u0014\n struggles, and political and military conflicts.\u0014\n\u0014\n Even so, it is important to underscore the inaccuracy of the \nstereotypical Western image of Islam as\u0014\n backward, anti-intellectual, and unsophisticated. The error of this \nimage is particularly ironic in view of the\u0014\n major contributions Muslims have made in the shaping of Western \ncivilization as we know it.\u0014\n\u0014\n When Europe was languishing in the \"Dark Ages,\" Islamic \ncivilization was thriving from Spain, across North\u0014\n Africa, through the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, and eastward \ninto India. Most people are surprised to\u0014\n discover the substantial contributions of Muslims in science, \nengineering, navigation, mathematics,\u0014\n chemistry, medicine, astronomy, philosophy, architecture, \nhorticulture, and calligraphy.\u0014\n\u0014\n Muslims are very proud of their history and civilization. For the \npast four centuries, however, much of the\u0014\n Muslim world has been dominated by external powers. Some of the \nconvulsions and upheavals evident in\u0014\n various predominantly Muslim lands today are born of frustration \nstemming from centuries of external control,\u0014\n superpower domination, and contemporary leaders who are rarely in \npower by virtue of popular choice. \u0014\n\u0014\n Many Muslims today believe that Islam can once again provide the \nframework for civilization--political,\u0014\n religious, economic, and social. Careful contextual analysis in \nsettings such as Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, and\u0014\n Indonesia reveals widely diverse views on how best to implement any \nkind of authentic Islamic state.\u0014\n Implementing the ideal continues to prove an elusive goal.\u0014\n\u0014\n Similarities and Differences with Christianity\u0014\n\u0014\n Rooted in the monotheistic tradition of the patriarch Abraham, \nChristians and Muslims share a common\u0014\n heritage with Jews. Both acknowledge one God, an omnipotent creator \nof the universe, the immortality of the\u0014\n soul, the existence of a future state of rewards and punishments. \nBoth affirm similar moral and ethical\u0014\n standards for life in community. \u0014\n\u0014\n Muslims perceive Muhammad as the last in a long succession of \nprophetic messengers sent to humankind.\u0014\n Many of the prophets named in the Quran are also major figures in \nthe Bible. These include Noah, Abraham,\u0014\n Moses, David, John the Baptist, and Jesus. Most Christians are \nsurprised to discover the importance\u0014\n Muslims attach to Jesus. Mentioned by name in 93 different verses, \nJesus is venerated as one of the\u0014\n greatest prophets. He is unique by virtue of the miraculous virgin \nbirth as well as his distinctive names.\u0014\n Jesus is called a \"word\" from God, the \"messiah,\" and \"a spirit \nfrom God.\" In the final analysis, however,\u0014\n Muslims are clear: Jesus, like all the prophets, was human.\u0014\n\u0014\n The error of Jesus followers, according to the Quran, is that they \nclaim things about Jesus--namely, that he\u0014\n was Gods son, divine, that he was resurrected by God and is now \npart of the Trinity--that Jesus never\u0014\n claimed for himself. These are dangerous teachings in the Islamic \nunderstanding because they challenge\u0014\n the absolute oneness and unity of God. Accordingly, the Quran \nincludes stern words of warning for\u0014\n Christians and others who associate anything so immediately with God.\u0014\n\u0014\n At the same time, Jews and Christians are called \"People of the \nBook\" and even promised their reward in\u0014\n paradise (Quran 2:62 and 5:69). Thus, the Quran includes both an \naffirmation of the similarities in basic\u0014\n theological and ethical perspectives and a clear rejection of the \ncentral Christian understanding of Jesus\u0014\n divinity.\u0014\n\u0014\n The different religious communities are explained as part of Gods \nplan. The diversity is caused, ironically, by\u0014\n different reactions to the various prophets. The fact that humankind \nis divided into various communities is\u0014\n explained as a test for people of faith. The emphasis falls on \nresponsible behavior here in this life.\u0014\n\u0014\n If God had so willed, He would have made all of you one community, \nbut (He has not done so) that He may\u0014\n test you in what He has given you; so compete with one another in \ngood works. To God you shall all return\u0014\n and He will tell you (the truth) about that which you have been \ndisputing (Quran 5:48).\u0014\n\u0014\n In our increasingly fragile and interdependent world, this verse \npresents a positive challenge. While\u0014\n Christians and Muslims will not come to complete theological \nagreement (with one another or among\u0014\n themselves), we can come to a better mutual understanding. And, by \nliving out the best of our religious\u0014\n traditions, we can \"compete with one another in good works.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Steps Toward Understanding and Cooperation\u0014\n\u0014\n Given the long history of animosity and misunderstanding between \nChristians and Muslims, it is clear that\u0014\n there are no quick fixes. There are no easy answers or simple \nsolutions that will ensure mutual\u0014\n understanding, respect, and cooperation. But the road is not \nblocked. There is a way forward. There are\u0014\n specific things that Christians and local churches can do to work \nfor a future wholly different from the tortured\u0014\n past.\u0014\n\u0014\n Education provides the basis for mutual understanding. Uninformed or \nerroneous views about the other are\u0014\n at the root of many problems plaguing Christian-Muslim relations. \nChurches can and should develop study\u0014\n programs to learn more about Islam. Through presentations by \ninformed leaders or working through an\u0014\n introductory text, Christians can develop a more accurate \nunderstanding of this rapidly growing religious\u0014\n tradition. Building on such a foundation, it is possible to address \nnumerous questions in a fair and balanced\u0014\n manner: What is the difference between Sunnis and Shiites? Who \nspeaks for the larger Muslim community?\u0014\n How are the roles of men and women understood in Islam? To what \nextent does Louis Farrakhan represent\u0014\n Islam or even the African-American Muslim community?\u0014\n\u0014\n Happily, there are resources to assist in this educational process. \nMany denominational bodies have offices\u0014\n devoted to Jewish-Christian-Muslim relations. Various ecumenical \norganizations--from local and state\u0014\n councils of churches to the National Council of Churches and the \nWorld Council of Churches--have been\u0014\n working on interfaith issues for several decades. The staff in these \nvarious offices are happy to provide\u0014\n resources and guidance on developing study programs in local \nchurches or as an ecumenical initiative in a\u0014\n community.\u0014\n\u0014\n A second type of program involves dialogical encounter with Muslims. \nMy former church, First Baptist Church\u0014\n in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in such a dialogue this fall. \nThe leader of the local mosque came to\u0014\n First Baptist for four weeks both to talk about Islam and to engage \nthe Christians on various issues he and\u0014\n other Muslims face as a minority community in Greenville. In the \nprocess, the participants in the dialogue\u0014\n were able to put a human face on Islam. This experience is \nparticularly important since dramatic events in\u0014\n the news often tend to do the opposite: dehumanize the other. \u0014\n\u0014\n Not all dialogical encounters are productive. Since people have \ndifferent agendas and perspectives, it is\u0014\n important to be clear about the focus and the ground rules for the \nencounter. There are so many questions\u0014\n and issues that might be addressed, it is wise to focus the \nparameters for the dialogue.\u0014\n\u0014\n Beyond educational efforts and structured dialogue, Christians and \nlocal churches might consider working\u0014\n together with local Muslims on social projects of mutual concern. \nSocietal problems such as homelessness,\u0014\n poverty, and the proliferation of drugs plague many communities. In \nsome settings, Christians and Muslims\u0014\n can strengthen their efforts by working together. Many Christian \nclergy and chaplains, for instance, have\u0014\n discovered that their Muslim colleagues have been remarkably \nsuccessful in programs of drug and prison\u0014\n rehabilitation. Why not learn from one another?\u0014\n\u0014\n As the Muslim population continues to grow in the United States, \nmore and more communities will be faced\u0014\n with new questions. How can public schools accommodate dietary needs \nor religious holidays for Muslim\u0014\n students? How does the presence of Muslim students relate to debates \nabout prayer in school? Now is the\u0014\n time to be building the foundation needed for a healthy, pluralist \nsociety.\u0014\n\u0014\n Christians and Muslims have traveled a long and often bumpy road \ntogether for some 14 centuries. On the\u0014\n eve of the 21st century, there are ominous signs that continuing \nmistrust and misunderstanding combined\u0014\n with upheaval and rapid political change may make the journey \nforward even more difficult and dangerous.\u0014\n But we are sojourners together on that road into the future. The \nways in which Christians and Muslims\u0014\n choose to travel that road will have profound consequences for both \ncommunities--and for the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n CHARLES KIMBALL is professor of religion and chair of the department \nof religion at Wake Forest University\u0014\n in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

I want to shoot\u0014\n               you in the face, he said, because you look so\u0014\n               evil. As a boy growing up in suburban\u0014\n               Minneapolis, Jim Greiling was a Cub Scout, a Little\u0014\n               Leaguer, a math whiz.

Their sons bouts have \nmeant calling the\u0014\n                         police, with his terrified mother pleading: \nHes 6-foot-4,\u0014\n                         and Im afraid of him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                For Jims sister, Angela Greiling \nKeane, a journalist\u0014\n                         in Washington, it means feelings of \nhelplessness, a\u0014\n                         thousand miles from crisis. Unexpected \ntelephone calls\u0014\n                         trigger anxiety. When its 7 a.m., and the \ncaller ID says\u0014\n                         its my parents, I automatically worry: is \nthere trouble with\u0014\n                         Jim?\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Theirs are ghastly struggles. After one of \nJims\u0014\n                         rampages at home his parents called the \npolice and\u0014\n                         asked them to take him to the hospital. But \nthe police\u0014\n                         refused, since the mentally ill cannot be \ncommitted until\u0014\n                         they pose a threat.

But while he was a student at the \nUniversity of Montana he called\u0014\n                         home and said something that gave his mother \nchills. He\u0014\n                         said he could hear the voices of women \nthrough the walls\u0014\n                         of the next apartment, said Mindy. He said \nthey were\u0014\n                         talking about him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Mindy Greiling, a state representative, was \nbusy at a late-night legislative session last\u0014\n                         year when another call came from Montana. \nJim had been arrested. After\u0014\n                         the session adjourned, she drove through the \nnight to the jail. She felt\u0014\n                         heart-broken, she says, as she saw her son \nbehind the glass wearing\u0014\n                         an orange prisoners suit, looking gaunt and \nwhiskered. Jim had\u0014\n                         broken a window in a  neighboring apartment, \nthen climbed inside, lay down on\u0014\n                         a sofa and fell asleep. The judge in Montana \nreleased\u0014\n                         Jim, who entered a state mental hospital \nwhere he\u0014\n                         underwent treatment for three months. Now he \nlives in a\u0014\n                         house in St. Paul with four other patients. \nEverybody is\u0014\n                         assigned a job; Jim drives a van on the late \nshift. He is\u0014\n                         taking his medicine and seems to have gotten\u0014\n                         accustomed to his routine.\u0014\n                          \u0014\n                         But for his family, the worries have scarcely\u0014\n                         stopped. Just the other day, the old voices \ncame back.\u0014\n                         Jim was sitting on the sofa with his father, \nwhen he turned\u0014\n                         and asked: Did you just say that you didnt \nlike me?\u0014\n                         The father said no. Jim smiled, reassured. \nFor his\u0014\n                         parents, it is frightening to know that Jim \nstill hears those\u0014\n                         voices. They can only hope that he ignores \nthem.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                                 2002 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

But no \nmultibillion-dollar\u0014\n                          antimissile system can stop it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                    THOUSANDS OF\u0014\n                                                   WOULD-BE MARTYRS?\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Now that Israel has come under an \nunprecedented wave of\u0014\n                          suicide attacks, Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon has responded with a\u0014\n                          relentless, if temporary, reoccupation of \nPalestinian cities.\u0014\n                          Protests spread last week throughout the \nMuslim world and\u0014\n                          Europe. But for at least four days, no \nsuicide bomb thundered through the \u0014\n                          daily life of Israeli civilians. Were the \nbombers broken? Or\u0014\n                          0were they just biding their time, and \npossibly looking for\u0014\n                          new targets? If we are to believe a recent \nIsraeli\u0014\n                          propaganda film, irrevocable seeds of \nhatred have been\u0014\n                          planted into an entire generation, and \nPalestinian\u0014\n                          childrenby the hundreds of thousandswill \ngrow,\u0014\n                          irrevocably, to be killers. And if \ndeath-cult terrorists can\u0014\n                          do what theyve done to mighty little \nIsrael, making life a\u0014\n                          daily dance with carnage, what can they do \nto the\u0014\n                          U.S.A.? As one Palestinian academic \nsuggests, without\u0014\n                          meaning it as a threat, if the present \nsituation continues,\u0014\n                          you are going to see the kind of terrorism \nall over the\u0014\n                          world that we had in the 1970s, but this \ntime with suicide\u0014\n                          attacks. Are there really thousands of \nwould-be martyrs\u0014\n                          out there, whole populationswhole \ncultures ready to\u0014\n                          clash with Western civilization? And if so, \nwhat possible\u0014\n                          defense can there \nbe?                                                          \u0014\n\u0014\n                           In fact, there are defenses, and some of \nthem are\u0014\n                           diplomatic. The anger of the Palestinians \nis not immune to\u0014\n                           negotiation, and theres no reason to \nthink its irrevocable.\u0014\n                           Nor is the anger of other Arabs and \nMuslims throughout\u0014\n                           the world, for whom the suffering of the \nPalestinians has\u0014\n                           become a satellite-broadcast\u0014\n                           passion play, inspiring their own most \nviolent currents.\u0014\n                           But diplomacy works slowly, and suicide \nbombers dont. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           How do you address the immediate threat? \nThere,\u0014\n                           too, answers exist. The despair that \nafflictsand\u0014\n                           motivatesso much of Palestinian society \nis not enough\u0014\n                           to launch a concerted campaign of suicide \nbombings. For\u0014\n                           that, cynical technicians are required who \nbuild an\u0014\n                           infrastructure to encourage, discipline \nand arm the\u0014\n                           would-be shahid, or martyr. Those same \ntechnicians\u0014\n                           have worked to create a mystique around \nthe dead,\u0014\n                           which attracts still more recruits. And \nall this takes\u0014\n                           money, so contributions have had to be \ncollected from\u0014\n                           sympathizers around the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                  In Gaza and the West Bank, Islamic \nfundamentalists\u0014\n                          from Hamas and other groups have nurtured a \ncult of\u0014\n                          death for years, having learned from the \nexample of\u0014\n                          Lebanons Hizbullah. At least since 1992, \nwhen several\u0014\n                          Hamas leaders were exiled to Lebanon by the \nIsraeli\u0014\n                          government, the two organizations have had \nextensive\u0014\n                          contacts. Teachers in Hamas day camps and \npreachers\u0014\n                          in mosques have kept up a constant chorus \nof praise for\u0014\n                          martyrs defending Palestinian lands. Like \nHizbullah,\u0014\n                          they called for an end to the Jewish state. \nIts a religious\u0014\n                          war, says Hani, a bearded 23-year-old \nHamas disciple in\u0014\n                          Gaza who neighbors say is destined for \nmartyrdom. This\u0014\n                          is not about land.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                          SEEKING THE UNMARRIED AND UNEMPLOYED\u0014\n                                 In the past, Hamas and Islamic Jihad \nfundamentalists\u0014\n                          operated highly secretive cells that \nrecruited young men\u0014\n                          deemed to be suitable candidates for \nsuicide missions.\u0014\n                          For the most part, these men, like Hani, \nwere unmarried\u0014\n                          and unemployed. Most were educated (at \nleast to the\u0014\n                          high-school level), but faced bleak \nfutures. Many were\u0014\n                          enticed, in part, by the promise of a \nwondrous marriage\u0014\n                          in heaven, where they would be greeted by \n72 dark-eyed\u0014\n                          virgins.\u0014\n                                  Over the past year, secular \nmilitants connected to\u0014\n                          Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasir Arafat \nhave stolen\u0014\n                          the banner of martyrdom that was growing so \npopular in\u0014\n                          the territories. Not to be outdone by \nIslamic\u0014\n                          fundamentalist rivals, terrorists from \nArafats Al Aqsa\u0014\n                          Martyrs Brigades have taken up suicide \nattacks. When\u0014\n                          the Al Aqsa Brigades saw that Hamas was \ntaking a lead\u0014\n                          in the intifada and threatening their \nstatus in the street,\u0014\n                          they adopted this suicide strategy, says \nEly Karmon of\u0014\n                          the counterterrorism institute. Neither \nFreud nor Allah is\u0014\n                          the primary motivator here; the dream of \nPalestine is.\u0014\n                          And the demographics and culture of the \nPalestinians\u0014\n                          are such that there is potentially an \nendless supply of\u0014\n                          cannon fodder to this cause: in 1995 and \n1996, when\u0014\n                          Hamas mounted its first major \nsuicide-bombing\u0014\n                          campaigns, only 20 percent of Palestinians \napproved; in\u0014\n                          the most recent poll, its 80 percent.\u0014\n                                  A document that Israeli military \nintelligence says it\u0014\n                          captured in Yasir Arafats headquarters \nlast week gives a\u0014\n                          weirdly banal picture of the infrastructure \nof terror that\u0014\n                          took shape. The paper, denounced as a \nfabrication by\u0014\n                          the Palestinians, appears to be an invoice \nfrom the\u0014\n                          the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Troops. By Israels \ncount, the Aqsa\u0014\n                          Brigades have mounted at least 22 attacks \nsince last\u0014\n                          August, killing 26 Israelis and wounding \n613. Among the\u0014\n                          itemized expenses from its early operations \nare various\u0014\n                          electrical components and chemical supplies \n(for the\u0014\n                          production of charges and bombs). The \nauthor of the\u0014\n                          memo goes on to point out that this has \nbeen our\u0014\n                          largest expensethe cost of a prepared \nbomb being at\u0014\n                          least 700 shekels, or roughly $150. We \nneed about five\u0014\n                          to nine bombs a weeks for our cells in \nvarious areas.\u0014\n                          There are also expense items for printing \nposters of\u0014\n                          some martyrs, mounting the portraits of \nothers on\u0014\n                          wooden boards and the cost of memorial \nceremonies for\u0014\n                          the dead. Other captured documents purport \nto show a\u0014\n                          request from Marwan Barghouti, the most \npopular of\u0014\n                          Arafats militia leaders in the West Bank, \nrequesting\u0014\n                          funds for a dozen men, of whom several were \non Israels\u0014\n                          wanted list of fugitives. Barghouti asked \n$1,000 for each.\u0014\n                          Arafat signed off on $350.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Compared with the impact of the operations, \nthe\u0014\n                          amounts are truly insignificant. But the \nmoney trail is not.\u0014\n                          Cash is needed not only to fund the \noperations but to\u0014\n                          maintain morale and propagate the hero \nworship that is\u0014\n                          at the heart of the suicide movement. Some \nfunds from\u0014\n                          Palestinian factions go to creating special \nmartyrs videos\u0014\n                          that serve as recruitment tapes. Theres a \nspecial unit in\u0014\n                          the military wing thats in charge of it, \nHamas official\u0014\n                          Ismail Abu Shanab told NEWSWEEK. Its done \non the\u0014\n                          last day of training, before the operation. \nMaking the\u0014\n                          video is a way of getting media exposure. \nIt gets the\u0014\n                          message out that these people are martyrs \nof their own\u0014\n                          free will. And it encourages others to \nbecome martyrs.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                          INCENTIVES FOR BOMBERS\u0014\n                                 At wakes for Hamas bombers, it has \nbecome routine\u0014\n                          for an activist to approach the father with \nan envelope\u0014\n                          containing $10,000. Abu Shanab says the \nmoney is a\u0014\n                          form of reparation to help the family \nrebound from their\u0014\n                          loss, but Israelis say it provides the \nbomber some\u0014\n                          incentive. If a guy knows that the money \nwill serve as a\u0014\n                          dowry for his sister, for instance, that it \nwill allow her to\u0014\n                          marry a good husband, this is a factor, \nsays one Israeli\u0014\n                          security official.\u0014\n                                  Sorrow is often maskedor \noverwhelmedby the\u0014\n                          cheers and praise of the community, but it \nis not erased.\u0014\n                          Shuhail Masri was never proud of what his \nson did. Last\u0014\n                          August, 22-year-old Izzedine Masri walked \ninto the\u0014\n                          Sbarro pizza restaurant in downtown \nJerusalem and blew\u0014\n                          himself up for Hamas, killing 15 people. \nBut the hundreds\u0014\n                          of well-wishers who went to the Masri home \nin the West\u0014\n                          Bank town of Aqqaba after the attack helped \ncomfort\u0014\n                          Shuhail and his wife, Fatima. In nearby \nJenin,\u0014\n                          Palestinians handed out candy on the \nstreets to\u0014\n                          celebrate the bombing. It took our minds \noff the loss of\u0014\n                          our son, Masri says. Now the crowds are \ngone and the\u0014\n                          misery remains: I lost my health. I wish I \nstill had my son\u0014\n                          around. If I knew, I would have stopped \nhim.\u0014\n                                  Iyad Sarraj, a Palestinian \npsychologist who studies\u0014\n                          the phenomenon of suicide attacks, says \nfamilies of the\u0014\n                          bombers are initially comforted by the \nstatus accorded to\u0014\n                          their sons. But if you go back to these \nfamilies six\u0014\n                          months later, you see nothing but grief.\u0014\n                                  The money to support organizations \nlike Hamas, as\u0014\n                          well as Arafats Fatah, largely comes from \noutside the\u0014\n                          Palestinian territories. Iraq said last \nweek it would now up\u0014\n                          its contribution to $25,000 (from $10,000) \nfor the family\u0014\n                          of each suicide bomber. But U.S. \nintelligence and\u0014\n                          law-enforcement officials say Iraq probably \nplays a minor\u0014\n                          role in financing suicide networks. The \nbulk of the money\u0014\n                          comes from the same sources that provide \nfunds to a\u0014\n                          wide assortment of radical Islamic groups \nand causes,\u0014\n                          including Al Qaeda: wealthy Arab \nbusinessmen,\u0014\n                          particularly from Saudi Arabia and other \noil states, and\u0014\n                          well-off Islamic families in the Western \nworld. Saudi\u0014\n                          Arabias foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal, \ntold\u0014\n                          NEWSWEEK last week that private Saudi \ndonations to\u0014\n                          Hamas had been cut since the group was put \non a\u0014\n                          special terrorist list by the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment in\u0014\n                          November. Now support goes only to the \nPalestinian\u0014\n                          Authority of Yasir Arafat, said al-Faisal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Money has also come from the United States.\u0014\n                          Treasury Department officials say they are \nconvinced\u0014\n                          that some U.S.-based groups whose assets \nhave been\u0014\n                          frozen by the president since September 11 \nwere raising\u0014\n                          money for Palestinian bombing missions. A \n49-page\u0014\n                          report sent by the FBI to the Treasury \nDepartment last\u0014\n                          November explicitly accuses one of the \nlargest U.S.\u0014\n                          Islamic charities, the Holy Land Foundation \nfor Relief and\u0014\n                          Development, of providing crucial \nfinancial support to\u0014\n                          the families of Hamas suicide bombers. \nEstablished in\u0014\n                          1989, the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation \nhas\u0014\n                          openly raised money to help Palestinians in \nthe West\u0014\n                          Bank and Gaza. But the FBI report says \nevidence\u0014\n                          strongly suggests that by providing \nannuities to the\u0014\n                          families of Hamas members, the Holy Land \nFoundation\u0014\n                          had helped Hamas over the years by \nproviding a\u0014\n                          constant flow of suicide volunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          NO PEACE EVER!\u0014\n                                 According to the FBI document, Holy \nLand\u0014\n                          Foundation officials have talked at \nmeetings inside the\u0014\n                          United States about how their organization \nwas\u0014\n                          supporting the families of Palestinian \nmartyrs. An FBI\u0014\n                          informant reported that, at a 1994 Muslim \nyouth\u0014\n                          association conference in Los Angeles \nattended by the\u0014\n                          foundations chief, a spokesman for the \nHamas military\u0014\n                          wing said, I hope no one is recording me \nor taking any\u0014\n                          pictures ... because Im going to speak the \ntruth to you.\u0014\n                          Its simple. Finish off the Israelis. Kill \nthem all! Exterminate\u0014\n                          them! No peace ever! Do not bother to talk \npolitics.\u0014\n                          According to the FBI report, $207,000 was \nraised after\u0014\n                          this speech for the cause. The Holy Land \nFoundation\u0014\n                          has denied government allegations that it \nsupports\u0014\n                          terrorism and has sued the Justice and \nTreasury\u0014\n                          Departments, seeking to have the courts \norder the\u0014\n                          government to unfreeze its assets. In a \nwritten statement,\u0014\n                          the foundation said that it is dedicated \nto alleviating the\u0014\n                          suffering of people ... around the world \n... particularly in\u0014\n                          Palestine. The organization said it \nrejects terrorism by\u0014\n                          anyone, and denied that it has ever acted \non behalf of\u0014\n                          Hamas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Another U.S.-based group that apparently \nhas ties\u0014\n                          to Hamas is the Islamic Association for \nPalestine. An INS\u0014\n                          report obtained by NEWSWEEK alleges that a \ntop Hamas\u0014\n                          official, Mousa Abu Marzook, had \ncontributed $490,000\u0014\n                          to the IAPs budget. The report notes that \nthe IAP\u0014\n                          distributed Hamas recruitment videos and \npublished two\u0014\n                          pro-Hamas newspapers. But the precise links \nbetween\u0014\n                          groups like IAP and operations against \ncivilians in Israel\u0014\n                          are hard, if not impossible, to find. IAP \npresident Rafeeq\u0014\n                          Jabar told NEWSWEEK that he was unaware who \nhad\u0014\n                          made the $490,000 contribution, and that his\u0014\n                          organizations funds are used to produce \nposition\u0014\n                          papers, videos and other materials \ndedicated to\u0014\n                          educating our fellow Americans about \nwhats going on in\u0014\n                          Palestine. We dont send money to martyrs. \nAsked\u0014\n                          about his appearance at a conference two \nyears ago,\u0014\n                          when he read the will of a Palestinian \nmartyr who had\u0014\n                          driven his car into Israeli soldiers and \ndied in a hail of\u0014\n                          gunfire, Jabar said: I read his will so \nthat people will feel\u0014\n                          the despair that Palestinians feel. These \npeople feel they\u0014\n                          have nothing to live for.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          So, is the worldor more to the point, are\u0014\n                          Americansdue for a new wave of attacks by \nsuicidal\u0014\n                          mass murderers? The possibility is there, \nbut on balance,\u0014\n                          the likelihood is not. There is nothing \nnatural about killing\u0014\n                          yourself in any culture. In those who have \nwaged\u0014\n                          suicide-war, the strongest motivation is \nprotection of\u0014\n                          home and hearth. Japans kamikaze pilots saw\u0014\n                          themselves as the last line of defense for \ntheir families in\u0014\n                          World War II. Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers, who \nhave carried\u0014\n                          out more than 170 suicide attacks in the \nlast 25 years,\u0014\n                          are fighting at the behest of a charismatic \nleader to\u0014\n                          secure their homeland. Lebanons Hizbullah \nhas a radical\u0014\n                          Islamic ideology, but it was created and \ngrew as a\u0014\n                          response to Israels 1982 invasion of their \ncountry.\u0014\n                          Although martyrdom is revered in Islam, the \nQuran\u0014\n                          recognizes the martyrdom only of those who \nfight to\u0014\n                          defend their faith and their land. Suicide, \nas a means of\u0014\n                          escape from this life, is regarded as a sin.\u0014\n                                  All of which may explain why Osama \nbin Laden, after\u0014\n                          processing tens of thousands of foreign \nrecruits through \u0014\n                          his Afghan camps, appears to have produced \nonly a\u0014\n                          relatively small number of suicide \nattackers. His ideas\u0014\n                          might have inspired most recruits to fight \nferociously, but\u0014\n                          not to embrace certain death. With the \ndestruction of bin\u0014\n                          Ladens infrastructure for indoctrinating, \ntraining and\u0014\n                          equipping his international terrorist \nbrigades of\u0014\n                          America-haters, the threat that he can \norganize future\u0014\n                          large-scale attacks really is reduced.\u0014\n                                  Palestinian suicide bombers pose a \nmore difficult\u0014\n                          problem. Precisely because the terrorism is \na reaction to\u0014\n                          occupation, the use of more intense and \nbrutal\u0014\n                          occupation to try to wipe them out is not \nlikely to have the\u0014\n                          desired effect. And the issue of \nPalestines liberation is of\u0014\n                          such passionate interest to Muslims \nthroughout the world\u0014\n                          that it could provide the impetus for new \nwaves of terror\u0014\n                          that have nothing whatsoever to do with Al \nQaeda, or\u0014\n                          could be exploited by the groups remnants.\u0014\n                                  And meanwhile, the youngest \ngeneration of\u0014\n                          Palestinians wakes up every morning with \nmore reason to\u0014\n                          die. After Israeli troops stormed into the \nJabaliya refugee\u0014\n                          camp last month, schoolteacher Samira Abu \nShamak was\u0014\n                          shocked to hear her 6-year-old daughter \nbegging for a\u0014\n                          gun or a bomb. She said, I want to be a \nmartyr,\u0014\n                          remembers Abu Shamak. What could I say? I \ndidnt\u0014\n                          know. I told her, Wait until youre grown \nup, dear.\u0014\n                          Maybemaybe things will change.

    "words": "Apr 25, 2002, Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nDepression\u0014\nIt's not just a case of the blues\u0014\n\u0014\nBY JOAN TUPPONCE\u0014\nSPECIAL CORRESPONDENT\u0014\n\u0014\n                    To look at Sue, who is 54, you wouldn't guess \nthat she suffers from depression. There are no outward signs. She \ngoes about her life with a calm resolve. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    But that hasn't always been the case. Last year, \nshe was suffering from anguishing anxiety attacks that would wake her \nabruptly at 4 a.m. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"I would wake up, and my heart would be \npounding,\" she said. \"I would be sweating, and my mind would be \nspinning out of control. I was in terror. I couldn't go back to \nsleep.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Sue's sleep became more and more fragmented. Her \ndesire to eat diminished. Frightened and exhausted, she finally \ndecided to make an appointment with her doctor. She was diagnosed \nwith depression and anxiety. Her doctor prescribed nortriptyline \n(Pamelor), a tricyclic antidepressant. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Sue admits she was wary of the drug because of \npast experiences with the antidepressants Zoloft and Effexor. They \ncaused her blood pressure to rise. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"I thought I couldn't take antidepressants,\" she \nsaid. But \"Nortriptyline has been perfect for me. It helps me sleep, \nand it has increased my appetite. It gave me what I needed.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Recognizing depression\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople often talk about feeling depressed or blue. But severe \ndepression is more than an occasional feeling of sadness. It is a \nserious medical condition that can impair a person's ability to \nfunction. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who are depressed have an imbalance of neurotransmitters - \nserotonin, norapanephrine or dopamine - in the brain. \nNeurotransmitters pass signals between nerve cells in the brain. \nAntidepressants seem to help restore the balance of those \nneurotransmitters. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No one understands exactly what depression really is,\" said Dr. Stan \nJennings, a psychiatrist with Tucker Psychiatric Clinic. \"When I see \na patient with a specific group of [depressive] symptoms, I can say \npretty confidently that this person is likely to respond to \nantidepressants.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be diagnosed with depression, at least five of the nine symptoms \nmust be present for at least two weeks and must be causing \nsignificant stress, impairment or changes from previous functioning. \u0014\n\u0014\nSymptoms can include: \u0014\n\u0014\n  depressed mood most of the day nearly every day; \u0014\n\u0014\n  decreased interest or loss of pleasure in almost all activities; \u0014\n\u0014\n  change in appetite or weight - excessive weight gain or loss; \u0014\n\u0014\n  change in sleep - insomnia or hypersomnia; \u0014\n\u0014\n  psychomotor agitation or retardation - feeling agitated or slowed \ndown; \u0014\n\u0014\n  fatigue, loss of energy; \u0014\n\u0014\n  feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt; \u0014\n\u0014\n  decreased concentration or indecisiveness; and \u0014\n\u0014\n  recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are other conditions that mimic depression, such as \nhypothyroidism, so it's important to see a doctor and be evaluated. \u0014\n\u0014\nDepression is increasingly recognized as a chronic and recurrent \ndisorder. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's a highly recurrent illness,\" said Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, \nassociate professor of psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth \nUniversity's Medical College of  Virginia and executive director of \nthe VCU Institute for Women's Health. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"People that have had one episode have over a 50 percent chance of \nhaving a second. People who have had a second episode have a 70 \npercent chance of a third. Over three, the chance is 90 percent,\" \nsaid Kornstein, who is also medical director of the VCU Mood \nDisorders Institute. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately \n18.8 million American adults have a depressive disorder. Nearly twice \nas many women as men are affected by depression. \u0014\n\u0014\nKornstein said 20 percent of adults develop depression that lasts two \nyears or longer. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's associated with severe and pervasive functional impairment,\" \nshe said. \"Sometimes, it's more severe than many chronic medical \ndisorders such as diabetes, hypertension and arthritis.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDepression can affect marital, family and social roles as well as \noccupational functioning and quality of life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The cost of depression in the U.S. is $44 billion when you add up \nboth direct and indirect costs such as absenteeism and loss of \nproduction and the high rates of health utilization,\" Kornstein said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn many cases, depression goes unrecognized and untreated. \"Only 10 \nto 40 percent of the patients who are depressed receive adequate \ntreatment because it goes unrecognized by the patient, family and \nhealth-care providers and because there is a stigma related to \ndepression,\" Kornstein said. \"It's\u0014\none of the most treatable conditions in all of medicine, but most \npeople never get help.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTreatment options \u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors take several approaches to treating depression, including \nantidepressants, psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and \ncombination treatments. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn its May 18, 2000, issue, The New England Journal of Medicine \nreported the findings of a study that included antidepressants, \ncognitive behavioral analysis and a combination treatment of the two. \nThe findings showed that 53 percent responded to therapy alone, 55 \npercent responded to medicine\u0014\nalone, and 85 percent responded to the combination treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"You want to give patients tools to handle interpersonal situations,\" \nKornstein said. \"Interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavior draw on \nthe best of both worlds. It teaches the consequences of behaviors in \ninterpersonal situations.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, Sue has begun coupling a cognitive-behavioral thinking \nprocess with her medication. \"It has made the biggest difference in \nmy life,\" she said. \"It's like night and day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n-----------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nApr 25, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\nNewest drugs cause fewer side effects\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first drug that acted as an antidepressant, iproniazid, was \nintroduced in the early 1950s.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe medicine was developed to help ease the symptoms of tuberculosis. \nAside from its effectiveness for tuberculosis, the drug also lifted \npatients' spirits and improved their appetites.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first tricyclic antidepressant, those that affect several brain \nchemicals simultaneously, was released in 1958.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince that time, antidepressants have gone through many changes. The \nlatest antidepressants to enter the market are serotonin reuptake \ninhibitors, which affect neurotransmitters but have fewer side \neffects than older drugs.\u0014\n\u0014\nSerotonin reuptake inhibitors cover a spectrum of disorders, \nincluding obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, panic disorder and \nmajor depression.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They have been scientifically proven effective in 25 to 30 \nillnesses,\" said Dr. Stan Jennings, a psychiatrist with Tucker \nPsychiatric Clinic. \"One in five people have a chance of getting \nbetter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Antidepressants today are safer than the ones introduced years ago,\" \nJennings said. \"The majority of people can't tell they are taking the \nmedicine. They don't experience any side effects. I think people can \nget scared off by side effects, and they may not take medicine that \nwould help them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough they are not habit-forming, antidepressants do have to be \nmonitored carefully by a physician to ensure that the patient is on \nthe correct dosage. Most antidepressants take awhile - up to six \nweeks - to get into a person's system and reach the full effect.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There are different phases of treatment,\" said Dr. Susan G. \nKornstein, associate professor of psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth \nUniversity's Medical College of Virginia and executive director of \nthe VCU Institute for Women's Health.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The first is the acute phase, where you alleviate the symptoms. That \nmay take 12 weeks. The second is the continuation phase to prevent a \nrelapse. That may take four to six months. The third is maintenance \ntreatment. The goal is to prevent recurrence of new episodes.\" As new \nantidepressants are being developed, doctors also are finding they \ncan be used for more than just depression. They are now being \nprescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual disorder, \nchronic pain syndrome and migraines.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I really wonder if we should be calling them antidepressants,\" \nKornstein said. - Joan Tupponce\u0014",

Only 2 of the 12 American \ncardinals there bothered to attend.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs American Catholics waited and prayed for a glimmer of humility, \nthe princes of the church strutted off to what one church official \ncalled \"other obligations,\" as if there were something more pressing \nthan the rape of children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while conservatives back home yammered that the answer was a \nreturn to clerical austerity, Cardinal Edward Egan luxuriated at a \nfive-star hotel near the Pantheon. (Add Gluttony to the list.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the cardinals issued a statement targeting \"notorious\" predatory \npriests, that notorious protector of predators, Cardinal Bernard Law, \nwas hiding in a friend's apartment inside the Vatican.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was supposed to be the moment when these shamed vicars would \nmake an extraordinary act of contrition, when the men who usually \nurge redemption angled for their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the leaders of a church built on symbols could not even manage \nthe symbolism. The empty chairs sent an unequivocal message: They \nhadn't learned a thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cardinals chose defiance over deference to the expectations of \ntheir devastated flock, which thought that celibacy, women priests \nand married priests might be discussed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe shepherds opted for arcane legalisms over actual remorse, \nmeaningless distinctions over meaningful changes: An abusive priest \nmight or might not be ejected from the club, depending on the age of \nhis victims and the frequency of his transgressions, and how long ago \nthe abuse occurred. Was he a \"serial\" offender or a hobbyist, intent \non abusing or inebriated? To the hair-splitting cardinals, these \nvariables still seemed to matter. To enraged American Catholics, they \nno longer do.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are angry that these spiritual arbiters are unyielding when the \n\"sins\" belong to us, not to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have relatives whose lives were choked because they could not get \nannulments  and thus remarry in the church  after their spouses \nbetrayed and abandoned them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know faithfully married women who are forced to violate the \nVatican stricture against birth control if they don't want 13 babies. \nWe are friends with gay Catholics who are expected to sacrifice \nintimacy to maintain their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nRome has resisted modernity, clinging to black and white.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut  astonishingly, disgustingly  on the matter of molestation, \nwhich any sane person does see in black and white, the cardinals \ndivine shades of gray.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took them three days and a deafening chorus of disapproval before \nthey ostensibly agreed on a one-grope-and-you're-out policy. They can \nstill water that down at the bishops conference in June.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it will be a miracle if they don't, given the increasing evidence \nthat church leaders in America, and perhaps even the Holy See, have \nengaged in a huge conspiracy, spurred by fear of blackmail. They \nknowingly put children in harm's way because they did not want the \npriests they should have punished to divulge the church's hypocrisy.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as the cardinals were making their way back from Rome, the \nArchdiocese of Boston released new documents in the case of the Rev. \nPaul Shanley, an unabashed molester who made a speech in 1977 \nasserting that no sexual act in and of itself causes damage to \nchildren, not even incest or bestiality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe documents show that Father Shanley threatened to spill the \nchurch's sexual secrets if he wasn't allowed to keep his street \nministry. They also include a 1972 essay in which the priest boasted: \n\"My name is to be found in the files of countless V.D. clinics in \nthis fair land. One of the first things I do in a new city is to sign \nup at the local clinics for help with my V.D.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the cardinals' Vatican statement, they said of the church, \"A \ngreat work of art may be blemished, but its beauty remains.\" Not at \nthis rate.\u0014",

    "words": "Obedience\u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago, Erma Bombeck printed a piece about having the meanest\u0014\nparents in all the world. It went something like this:\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the meanest parents in all the world. When I was seven years \nold they\u0014\ndared to spank me just because I told them I would not do what they \nasked me\u0014\nto do to help around the house. My friend next door never got \nspanked. He\u0014\ndidn't have to help at home. He had nice parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the meanest parents. I had to eat all my broccoli and carrots \nbefore\u0014\nthey would ever let me have dessert. My friend next door never had to \neat\u0014\nvegetables. He had fast food brought in with burgers and shakes and \nbrownies\u0014\nwith all kinds of ice cream.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the meanest parents. They made me go to church every Sunday as \nlong as\u0014\nI lived under their roof, sit there in that boring worship service. \nMy friend next door could do as he pleased. He never went to church. \nSunday was a fun day for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the meanest parents. They made me work for my allowance. I had \nto get\u0014\na job helping an elderly old man with chores around his house. My \nfriend\u0014\nnext door never had to do anything and he was given four times as much\u0014\nallowance as I could ever earn. He had nice parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had the meanest parents. When I turned sixteen, they made me earn \npoints\u0014\nbefore I could drive the family car. My friend next door was given a \nbrand\u0014\nnew luxury automobile. My folks had bought an old jalopy for me to \nget back\u0014\nand forth to school, but you think I'd drive that hunk of junk and \npark it\u0014\nbeside those Jeep Wagoneers, BMWs, Buicks and Mercedes? My friend had \nit\u0014\nmade.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr so I once thought, but, when we reached age thirty, I had a change \nin\u0014\nperspective. I had learned that my parents were not so mean after \nall. I was\u0014\nexperiencing: the pleasure of work, the reward of recreation, the \nstrength\u0014\nof a healthy body, the bonds of a strong marriage, the inward \nconfidence\u0014\nthat comes from faith and the wonderful supportive fellowship that \ncomes\u0014\nfrom the Church as a community of believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for my friend, things were not going so well: he was not finding \nhis\u0014\nniche in the workplace, nothing seemed to satisfy him, he was having\u0014\ndifficulty getting along with people who were not willing to do \neverything\u0014\njust as he thought he knew it ought to be done, his marriage had not \nlasted\u0014\neven two years, his body was getting out of shape, and he evidenced a\u0014\ncynical outlook without any under-girding that comes from the \nassurance of\u0014\nfaith.\u0014",

All of these were \ncontroversial at the time,\u0014\n                      not unlike today's intraevangelical debates \nover worship styles\u0014\n                      and strategies for church growth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the dawn of the twentieth century, the \nevangelical consensus\u0014\n                      shaped by the Reformation and the Awakening was \nthreatened\u0014\n                      by theological liberalism and the rise of \ndestructive biblical\u0014\n                      criticism. This led to fierce debates and \nchurch splits between\u0014\n                      fundamentalist defenders of the faith and their\u0014\n                      accommodationist critics. After World War II, a \nnew coalition of\u0014\n                      postfundamentalist evangelicals emerged. These\u0014\n                      \"neo-evangelicals\" believed as firmly as the \nfundamentalists in\u0014\n                      the truthfulness of the Bible, but they also \nbelieved Christians\u0014\n                      should be intellectually strong, culturally \nliterate, socially\u0014\n                      engaged, and cooperative in spirit. Blessed \nwith visionary\u0014\n                      leaders such as Billy Graham, John Stott, Carl \nHenry, and Bill\u0014\n                      Bright, evangelicals in the past half-century \nhave moved from\u0014\n                      the margins into the mainstream, with a \nproliferation of\u0014\n                      publications, institutions, and parachurch \nministries. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The evangelical future will likely be shaped \noutside the West,\u0014\n                      where great strength is seen in Africa, Latin \nAmerica, parts of\u0014\n                      Asia. Ten years ago, when 4,000 evangelical \ndelegates\u0014\n                      gathered for a major conference in Manila, they \ncame from 173\u0014\n                      nations, more countries than were represented \nin the United\u0014\n                      Nations. This has led theologian Wolfhart \nPannenberg to\u0014\n                      predict that evangelicals, along with the \nOrthodox and Roman\u0014\n                      Catholics, will constitute one of the three \nmajor forces in the\u0014\n                      world Christian movement of the next century. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another way of defining evangelical is to list \nthose common\u0014\n                      characteristics held by Christians willing to \nbe called by this\u0014\n                      name. Historian David Bebbington points to a \ncommon\u0014\n                      evangelical stress on personal conversion \n(\"being born again\"),\u0014\n                      activism (both evangelistic and social), \nbiblical authority, and\u0014\n                      the centrality of the Cross. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While such a list is helpful in pointing out \nmajor emphases, it\u0014\n                      can also obscure the basic continuities linking \nevangelicals with\u0014\n                      other orthodox Christians on such key doctrines \nof the faith as\u0014\n                      the Holy Trinity and the classic Christology of \nthe early church.\u0014\n                      Fundamentalism ignored this great dogmatic \ntradition in the\u0014\n                      name of simple biblicism, while liberalism \ndenied it in the interest\u0014\n                      of cultural relevance. Evangelicals celebrate \nthese doctrines as\u0014\n                      essential to the gospel itself. But we also \nbelieve these\u0014\n                      teachings have important implications for how \nwe work, worship,\u0014\n                      pray, order our families, and relate to the \nworld around us. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      An evangelical is a herald charged to deliver \nan urgent\u0014\n                      message. Many things can be said about a \nherald, but what\u0014\n                      matters most is the message. The word we bring \nis the greatest\u0014\n                      news ever spoken or heard. Evangelicals are \npeople with\u0014\n                      passion to know the living Godthe Father, the \nSon, and the\u0014\n                      Holy Spiritand to make his grace and love \nknown to every\u0014\n                      person on earth. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Timothy George, senior adviser at \nCHRISTIANITY TODAY.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\n                      I Was a Daughter of Islam\u0014\n                      What I discovered when I lifted the veil on my \nworld\u0014\n                      By Rockie\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I was born in Jordan to a Muslim family, and \nwas named Ruqaya after\u0014\n                      one of the prophet Muhammad's daughters. My \nuncle, who'd moved to\u0014\n                      Chicago, told my dad about the wonderful \nopportunities in the U.S.,\u0014\n                      so my dad moved our family here when I was \neight years old. While\u0014\n                      he was excited about providing for his family, \nmy father worried that\u0014\n                      we'd grow up \"Christian.\" So while my siblings \nand I went to a public\u0014\n                      school during the week, we attended Islamic \nstudies on the\u0014\n                      weekends. The only friends I had were the \nMuslim kids who attended\u0014\n                      Islamic studies with me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As I grew older, my dad became more concerned \nabout the\u0014\n                      possibility I'd become \"Americanized.\" So when \nI turned 14, my father\u0014\n                      decided I should return to Jordan to live with \nmy grandmother. I wasn't\u0014\n                      thrilled about living so far from my family, \nbut when I arrived in Jordan,\u0014\n                      I loved the people, the culture, and Islam, so \nI was happy to stay.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      More than 90 percent of Muslims are of the \nSunni sectthose who\u0014\n                      strictly follow the Qur'an and the Hadith (the \nsayings of Muhammad).\u0014\n                      Since my family was Sunni, I prayed five times \na day, fasted during\u0014\n                      the month of Ramadan, read the Qur'an daily, \nwore the veil (covering\u0014\n                      my entire body, and showing only my hands, \nface, and feet), and tried\u0014\n                      to imitate the prophet Muhammad in every way. \nBut no matter what I\u0014\n                      did for Allah, I felt I needed to do more to \navoid his wrath. I tried to\u0014\n                      earn his favor so I could go to heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I spent three years in Jordan, but missed my \nfamily so much, I asked\u0014\n                      my dad if I could return to live with them in \nthe U.S. Once I returned, I\u0014\n                      stopped wearing my head covering because I \ndidn't want to look like\u0014\n                      an \"oddball,\" but I still kept strong in my \nprayers and my faith. And I\u0014\n                      was contentuntil my father decided it was time \nfor me to get\u0014\n                      married.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Arab culture dictates men and women are not \nallowed to date. When\u0014\n                      a man finds a \"suitable\" woman, it's usually \nthrough family\u0014\n                      connections. The man and his family visit the \nyoung girl's home to\u0014\n                      meet her family. The \"couple\" are allowed to \nspeak to each other, but\u0014\n                      only in the presence of both families. After \nseveral similar visits, the\u0014\n                      couple decide if they want to get married. In \nIslam, a woman has the\u0014\n                      right to say no, but in the culture, the family \nusually pressures the girl\u0014\n                      to say yes. In both the culture and religion, a \nwoman can marry her\u0014\n                      first cousin. So when I turned 23, my dad \npressured me to marry my\u0014\n                      first cousin who lives in Jordan. While I was \nagainst the marriage and\u0014\n                      certainly didn't want to spend the rest of my \nlife married to someone I\u0014\n                      didn't love, I didn't feel I had the choice to \ngo against my father's\u0014\n                      wishes. My father flew there ahead of me to \nprepare for the wedding.\u0014\n                      The rest of my family couldn't afford to fly to \nJordan, so my father\u0014\n                      would be the only immediate family member at \nthe ceremony.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A week later, my elder brother took me to the \nairport to ensure I got\u0014\n                      on the plane. Because of tight security on \ninternational flights, my\u0014\n                      brother was unable to take me directly to my \ngate, so he dropped me\u0014\n                      off at the main terminal and went home.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As I waited for my flight, I thought about my \nfuture. I didn't want to\u0014\n                      marry my first cousin! But if I didn't, I'd \ndisgrace my family.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Arab culture, when a woman disgraces her \nfamilyor is even\u0014\n                      rumored to have done soshe deserves to die. I \nknew if I left the\u0014\n                      airport and ran away, my family would come \nafter me to kill me for\u0014\n                      disgracing them. But the longer I thought about \nhow miserable I'd be\u0014\n                      married to a man I didn't love or respect, the \nmore angry I became.\u0014\n                      I've fasted for you; I've prayed five times a \nday to you; I've even\u0014\n                      studied the Qur'an for you, I inwardly screamed \nat Allah. And this is\u0014\n                      what you allow to happen?! Right then, on \nFebruary 10, 1990, I\u0014\n                      stopped praying and worshiping Allah.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I grabbed my luggage and escaped to the nearest \nhotel to hide. I\u0014\n                      didn't have much money and desperately tried to \nthink of what to do\u0014\n                      next. I didn't have many American friends \nbecause my father wouldn't\u0014\n                      allow me to be influenced by their \"Satanic \nways.\" But I did know one\u0014\n                      American woman whom I called from the hotel. I \ntold her briefly what\u0014\n                      happened and asked if I could stay with her for \na while. She came\u0014\n                      immediately and picked me up.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When the plane landed in Jordan 16 hours later \nwithout me on it, my\u0014\n                      father became furious. He called my brother and \ntold him to find me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I stayed with my friend for a few weeks, until \none day my brother\u0014\n                      showed up at her office with a gun. He told \nher, \"I know you have my\u0014\n                      sister. Give her back before anybody gets \nhurt!\" A coworker called the\u0014\n                      police, but my brother left before they \narrived. My friend got home that\u0014\n                      night and told me it was too dangerous for me \nto stay with her any\u0014\n                      longer, but recommended I stay at a shelter for \nwomen suffering from\u0014\n                      domestic violence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I arrived at the shelter, they told me I \ncouldn't stay there either\u0014\n                      because they'd seen two men showing my photo at \na nearby\u0014\n                      restaurant. They sent me to another shelter an \nhour away.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After several weeks at that shelter, and only \nafter I began to feel safe,\u0014\n                      did I allow myself to feel any emotions. \nEverything I'd aaaaaaaaaaaaa up burst\u0014\n                      out of me, and I sobbed as I mourned the loss \nof my family and my\u0014\n                      way of life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Because I had a naturalized U.S. citizenship, I \njoined the National\u0014\n                      Guard for the government's protection. After my \ntraining, I returned\u0014\n                      and found a job. Miraculously, I hid from my \nfamily for four years. But\u0014\n                      I missed them so much, I finally gathered my \ncourage, contacted my\u0014\n                      mother, and met with her and my younger sister. \nWe spent most of\u0014\n                      our time together in tears. The rest of my \nfamily had little to say to\u0014\n                      me. But slowly over time, my family and I began \nto make peace, and I\u0014\n                      was amazed at how they finally accepted me \nback. I thought, Allah\u0014\n                      didn't neglect me after all, and returned to my \nfaith. I didn't pray five\u0014\n                      times a day or worship him the way I had in the \npast, but I thanked\u0014\n                      him daily and did nice things I thought would \nplease him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In february 1998, I accepted a job for a \ncompany based in Texas.\u0014\n                      Three days after I moved, I met Robyn, who was \nwalking her dog in\u0014\n                      front of my apartment. We started talking and \nbecame fast friends. So\u0014\n                      when she invited me to go to her church, I \nagreed. It's probably okay,\u0014\n                      I thought. My faith believes that Jesus was a \nmessenger of Allah, too.\u0014\n                      I'm sure Allah won't be upset if I go to \nchurch. I enjoyed the pastor's\u0014\n                      sermonexcept when he talked about Jesus. \nSometimes he'd say\u0014\n                      Jesus is God, and sometimes he'd say Jesus is \nthe Son of God. How\u0014\n                      could Jesus be both God and God's Son? But I \ncontinued to go to\u0014\n                      church with Robyn until one day the pastor said \nthe church was\u0014\n                      supporting missionaries in Muslim countries \nwhere they don't know\u0014\n                      Jesus. I thought, Of course Muslims know Jesus. \nI need to set the\u0014\n                      record straight. After the service, I \nintroduced myself to the pastor,\u0014\n                      Pete, and said, \"I'm a Muslim, and I do know \nJesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I was thoroughly convinced the prophet Muhammad \nwas the last\u0014\n                      messenger and the Qur'an was the last book sent \nby Allah. The\u0014\n                      Qur'an clearly states Jesus was a messenger \nborn of a virgin mother,\u0014\n                      Mary. He performed many miracles such as \nbringing the dead to life,\u0014\n                      healing the sick, speaking when he was a baby, \nand creating a bird\u0014\n                      out of clay. Allah loved him so much that when \nhis enemies were\u0014\n                      preparing to crucify him, he sent someone who \nlooked like Jesus to\u0014\n                      be crucified instead. Muslims believe Jesus \nnever died, but was\u0014\n                      raised to heaven to be protected from his \nenemies. Jesus, in the\u0014\n                      Qur'an, claims he never told anyone to worship \nhim but to worship the\u0014\n                      one true God, Allah. According to Muslims, the \nBible has been\u0014\n                      changedand Christians and Jews don't really \nhave the true books.\u0014\n                      When Allah gave Muhammad the message, Allah \npreserved the\u0014\n                      Qur'an and made sure no one changed it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The more I attended church, the more I wondered \nwhy Christians had\u0014\n                      different beliefs than Muslims; both the Bible \nand the Qur'an couldn't\u0014\n                      be right. As I wrestled with Christianity, I \nasked Robyn and Pete:\u0014\n                      Was Jesus crucified? Did Jesus die on the cross \nfor our sins? Is\u0014\n                      Jesus God, or the Son of God? What is meant by \nthe Trinity? Is the\u0014\n                      Bible really accurate?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I read different books on Christianity and \nIslam and discovered the\u0014\n                      Bible hadn't changed; its books were accurate. \nThen Pete introduced\u0014\n                      me to a Bible professor, Dan, who took me \nthrough the messianic\u0014\n                      prophesies of the Old Testament and showed me \nhow they were\u0014\n                      fulfilled in the New Testament. At that point I \nwas able to believe\u0014\n                      Jesus was crucified for our sins. But I still \nwrestled with whether or\u0014\n                      not Jesus was God. In Islam, to believe in any \ngod other than Allah is\u0014\n                      blasphemous and unforgivable.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On Sunday, August 2, 1998, several months after \nI started to\u0014\n                      investigate Christianity, an Iranian Christian \npastor named Iraj, whom I\u0014\n                      met through Pete, called and said he'd like to \nmeet to discuss our\u0014\n                      beliefs. That evening, I visited with him and \ntold him I believed in\u0014\n                      Jesus' crucifixion, but not in his deity. I \nalso told him I'd studied the\u0014\n                      life of Jesus and no one in history compares to \nhim. Iraj said, \"Well, if\u0014\n                      you think Jesus is that wonderful and that he \ndied on the cross for\u0014\n                      your sins, will you confess that before God?\" I \nagreed, and we prayed\u0014\n                      together. That was the day I received Jesus as \nmy Savior. After that,\u0014\n                      God's Spirit began to open my eyes to the truth \nof Jesus' deity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's been almost four years since that day. My \ndad and elder sister\u0014\n                      refuse to speak to me. I maintain a \nrelationship with my mom, who\u0014\n                      doesn't mention my conversion. My brother \nrejected me. The rest of\u0014\n                      my family tolerates my new religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of my deepest longings is to see my family \nand all Muslims\u0014\n                      accept Jesus as their Savior and to see \nChristians burdened for the\u0014\n                      Muslim people, especially the ones living in \nthe U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I'm so grateful Jesus led me to himself. He's \nbeen there for me when I\u0014\n                      needed himand even when I thought I didn't \nneed him. In Islam, I\u0014\n                      had to work to earn God's approval. Now I'm \nfree to bask in God's\u0014\n                      unconditional love! Above all, I'm amazed he \nloves me so much he\u0014\n                      died on the cross for meso that now I'm a \ndaughter of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rockie is a student majoring in biblical \nstudies.

Here's what you \ncan do to make an\u0014\n                       impact.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          1.Pray for them. The only way a Muslim will \never come to\u0014\n                            Christ is if the Holy Spirit works in her \nheart to draw her to\u0014\n                            the truth. Pray specifically that: \nMuslims would be open to\u0014\n                            reading the Bible and would believe the \nBible is the\u0014\n                            preserved, authentic Word of God; they'll \nbelieve Jesus was\u0014\n                            crucified for their sins and resurrected \nfrom the dead; God\u0014\n                            will remove any misconceptions they have \nabout\u0014\n                            Christianity; God will give them courage \nto surrender to\u0014\n                            Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          2.Know your faith. It isn't as important to \na Muslim what you\u0014\n                            know about Islam as it is important for \nyou to know about\u0014\n                            your own faith. Steep yourself in God's \nWord so you can\u0014\n                            address any questions a Muslim may have \nabout what the\u0014\n                            Bible and Christianity teach.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          3.Remove any misconceptions about Muslims. \nNot all\u0014\n                            Muslims are extremists, such as the \nTaliban. Not all of them\u0014\n                            hate Americans or Jews. Basically, they \nwant the same\u0014\n                            good things from life we want. Many \nChristians assume all\u0014\n                            Muslims know Islam and the Qur'an very \nwell. The fact is,\u0014\n                            however, most Muslims are Muslim in name \nonly; they know\u0014\n                            little of their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          4.Befriend them. The best way to reach out \nto a Muslim is to\u0014\n                            show her Christ's love. Sharing the \ngospel isn't enough to\u0014\n                            reach a Muslim. She has on spiritual \nblinders (2 Corinthians\u0014\n                            4:4) that require time, prayer, and the \noutpouring of Christ's\u0014\n                            love working through you. But the results \nof your persistence\u0014\n                            will be worth it (Galatians 6:9). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2002 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/Today's Christian\u0014\n                      Woman magazine.\u0014",

    "words": "Is Revelation Prophecy or History?\u0014\n                      Some events described in Revelation occurred\u0014\n                      contemporaneously with the prophecies \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Q:\u0014\n                           I've heard some theologians say Revelation \nis not about\u0014\n                           the future but about things that have \nalready happened.\u0014\n                           Where does this interpretation come from, \nand is it\u0014\n                           scriptural? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Bill Solomon, Wilmington, \nNorth Carolina\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A: The Book of Revelation is the most difficult \nof all New\u0014\n                      Testament books to interpret because of the \nextensive\u0014\n                      symbolism. These symbols, which often seem \nstrange and\u0014\n                      bizarre, have resulted in various methods of \ninterpretation, from\u0014\n                      which we can identify four: historical, \nidealist, futurist, and\u0014\n                      preterist. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The historical sees Revelation as a symbolic \nprophecy of the\u0014\n                      entire history of the church from the \nIncarnation to the return of\u0014\n                      Christ to establish the eternal state. In \ncontrast to this view, the\u0014\n                      idealist avoids the difficulty of trying to \nfind fulfillment of the\u0014\n                      book's images in history. Rather, these \ninterpreters see only a\u0014\n                      symbolic portrayal of the spiritual cosmic \nconflict between the\u0014\n                      kingdom of God and the powers of evil. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Probably the most popular interpretation of \nRevelation at the\u0014\n                      end of the twentieth centuryevidenced by the \nmillions of\u0014\n                      copies that Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have \nsold in their\u0014\n                      popular Left Behind seriesis the futurist. \nThis approach\u0014\n                      interprets the book not as what was future to \nJohn and is now\u0014\n                      past or present to us, but as what was future \nto John and still\u0014\n                      future to us. It understands that the Book of \nRevelation has to\u0014\n                      do with the future of the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Recently, theologians such as R. C. Sproul, in \nhis 1998 book\u0014\n                      The Last Days According to Jesus (Baker), have \nrevived\u0014\n                      interest in the preterist interpretation. This \napproach regards\u0014\n                      the events symbolized in Revelation as having \noccurred roughly\u0014\n                      contemporaneously with John's writing of the \nbook, which Sproul\u0014\n                      dates before the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. \nThus, for the\u0014\n                      preterist, the \"last days\" arrived at the time \nof John. Preterist\u0014\n                      interpreters stress the fact that Revelation \nbelongs to a distinct\u0014\n                      genre of Jewish-Christian writings called \n\"apocalyptic,\" which\u0014\n                      are \"spiritual guides for difficult times.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In his book, Sproul makes a helpful distinction \nbetween a \"full\u0014\n                      preterist\" and a \"partial preterist,\" \nidentifying himself with the\u0014\n                      latter. The full preterist interpretation \nstates that Revelation\u0014\n                      addressed the early Christians' hope that they \nwould soon be\u0014\n                      delivered from the persecution they were \nexperiencing at the\u0014\n                      hands of Rome. Thus John wrote to strengthen \ntheir faith. Even\u0014\n                      in the midst of persecution they could be \nencouraged that God\u0014\n                      would intervene, Christ would return, Rome \nwould be\u0014\n                      conquered, and the kingdom of God would be \nestablished. Full\u0014\n                      preterists contend that even though these \nevents did not\u0014\n                      completely come to pass, John's writings \naccomplished their\u0014\n                      purpose by emboldening the first-century \nchurch. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While the partial preterist view of Revelation \nasserts that John\u0014\n                      was indeed addressing times of persecution and \ntribulation in\u0014\n                      the first centurya point that distinguishes it \nfrom the futurist\u0014\n                      perspectiveit also contends that the \"Day of \nthe Lord,\" the\u0014\n                      second coming of Christ, and the \"resurrection \nof the dead\" are\u0014\n                      all future events, which separates it from the \nfull preterist\u0014\n                      position. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As a new millennium dawns, the futurist view of \nthe end times\u0014\n                      dominates popular expectations. A recent \nAssociated Press\u0014\n                      story (Nov. 14, 1997) announced that one in \nfour adult\u0014\n                      Christians expects Christ to return very soon, \nor certainly in his\u0014\n                      or her lifetime. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Naturally, a futurist reading of Revelation can \nboost these\u0014\n                      sentiments. A preterist view, however, offers \nthe strength of\u0014\n                      reading Revelation in light of its original \ncontext. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both the futurist and preterist views have \ntheir strengths and\u0014\n                      weaknesses. Instead of choosing only one or the \nother, a\u0014\n                      \"both/and\" approach that applies the strengths \nof each is a\u0014\n                      better option. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some events to which the symbolism of \nRevelation points\u0014\n                      occurred contemporaneously with the prophecies \nthemselves.\u0014\n                      Others will not occur until the second coming \nof Jesus Christ.\u0014\n                      Combining the preterist and futurist views \nallows us to\u0014\n                      understand both that the message of Revelation \nspoke directly\u0014\n                      to John's own age and that it represents the \nconsummation of\u0014\n                      redemptive history. Thus, the Beast can refer \nto the Roman\u0014\n                      emperor in the first century as well as the \ncoming Antichrist at\u0014\n                      the end of the age. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The preterist position by itself fails to \nunderstand that\u0014\n                      Revelation confronts the modern reader with \npromises,\u0014\n                      challenges, and choices that are similar, if \nnot identical, to those\u0014\n                      faced by the book's original readers. The \nfuturist position by\u0014\n                      itself is prone to see Revelation as a crystal \nball with a literal\u0014\n                      timetable of events that will happen in the \nfuture. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While the final book in the Bible had immediate \nrelevance to the\u0014\n                      first-century church, it also speaks powerfully \nto us about the\u0014\n                      return of Christ, his judgment of this world, \nand God's ultimate\u0014\n                      eschatological victory over the power of evil. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By David S.

    "title": "IS CREMATION SCRIPTURAL?",
    "words": "Cremation Confusion\u0014\nIs it unscriptural for a Christian to be cremated?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Timothy George | posted 05/21/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ancient world knew four methods of disposing of the bodies of the \ndead. Cremation was the normal practice of Greeks and Romans. Many of \nthem believed in the immortality of the soul and saw no reason to \ngive special attention to the body. Hindus, with their doctrine of \nreincarnation, still practice cremation. At the other extreme were \nthe Egyptians, who mummified their dead, preserving the corpse \nindefinitely.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the catacombs in Rome attest, the early Christians insisted on \nburying their dead. Christian gravesites were called coemeteria \n(cemeteries), which literally means \"sleeping places,\" reflecting \nbelief in a future resurrection. Early liturgies for the dead \nincluded the reading of Scriptures, prayers, hymns, and almsgiving \nfor the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy were Christians so concerned about proper disposal of the body? \nHere are four reasons: (1) The body of every human was created by \nGod, bore his image, and deserved to be treated with respect because \nof this. (2) The centrality of the Incarnation. When the Word became \nflesh, God uniquely hallowed human life and bodily existence forever. \n(3) The Holy Spirit indwelt the bodies of believers, making them \nvessels of honor. (4) As Jesus himself was buried and raised bodily \nfrom the dead, so Christians believed that their burial was a witness \nto the resurrection yet to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, many martyrs were burned to death, but Christians believed \nGod would bring them forth unimpaired at the resurrection. \"We do not \nfear any loss from any mode of sepulture,\" declared Minucius Felix, \n\"but we adhere to the old and better custom of burial.\" In the \ncontext of the early church, when cremation was associated with pagan \nrituals and unbiblical beliefs, burial seemed to be a more loving and \nreverent way to bear witness to God's ultimate victory over death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what about today? The first cremation in America took place in \n1876, accompanied by readings from Charles Darwin and the Hindu \nscriptures. For many years, relatively few persons (mostly liberals \nand freethinkers) chose cremation. But that has changed dramatically. \nOnly 5 percent of Americans were cremated in 1962; by 2000 it was \n25.5 percent. In Japan, where burial is sometimes illegal, the \ncremation rate is 98 percent. The rise in cremations reflects many \nfactors: concern for land use; the expense of traditional funerals; \nthe loss of community and a sense of \"place\" in modern transient \nsociety; and New Age-type spiritualities.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the weight of Christian tradition clearly favors burial, the \nBible nowhere explicitly condemns cremation. Since 1963 the Roman \nCatholic Church has permitted cremation while \"earnestly \nrecommending\" burial as the preferred mode of disposal. Billy Graham \nhas noted (what Christians have always believed) that cremation \ncannot prevent a sovereign God from calling forth the dead at the end \nof time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible should not be used as a proof text either for the necessity \nof burial or for \"cremation on demand.\" True, there are several \nexamples of cremation in the Old Testament (Achan, Josh. 7:25; Saul, \n1 Sam. 31:12; the King of Edom, Amos 2:1), but they involved God's \njudgment and curse. When Paul offered his body to be burned (1 Cor. \n13:3), he was speaking of martyrdom, not cremation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus said, \"Let the dead bury the dead,\" he was describing the \ncost of discipleship, not the cost or method of funerals.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe real question for Christians is not whether one is buried or \ncremated but the meaning given to these acts. Our modern funeral \ncustoms tend to anesthetize us from the ugly reality of death with \nsoft music, plush carpets, and expensive caskets.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Presbyterian preacher George Buttrick once said, \"There is \nnothing more incongruous than dressing up a corpse in a tuxedo!\" \nCremation, too, can be done in ways that desecrate rather than \nrespect the dead. For example, one can now order designer urns in \nwhich elements of a loved one's \"cremains\" are mixed with clay and \nglazed to create a piece of lovely pottery!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether final disposition is by burial or cremation, the Christian \nchurch should offer a funeral liturgy in which the reality of death \nis not camouflaged, and the resurrection of the body is affirmed. We \nsolemnize the departure of our loved ones by reminding ourselves that \nwe brought nothing into this world, and that we can carry nothing \nout. \"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and \ncertain hope of the resurrection unto eternal life, through our Lord \nJesus Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy George is a CT executive editor and dean of Beeson Divinity \nSchool at Samford University.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today\u0014",

Evangelical \nleaders emphatically deny that\u0014\n                            End Times theology plays any role in \ntheir support of Israel. So the\u0014\n                            debate among Jews is whether to believe \nthem, and whether it\u0014\n                            matters. \"You're playing with fire \nthere,\" says Harvey Cox, professor of\u0014\n                            divinity at Harvard. \"I'd be awfully \ncautious about this alliance if I were\u0014\n                            on the Israeli side.\" The reason is that \nonce you move into End\u0014\n                            Times theology, the interests of the two \ngroups split apart. According\u0014\n                            to prophecy, the Jews must be in control \nof Israel for Jesus to return.\u0014\n                            But in the last battle, two-thirds of the \nJews perish, and the rest either\u0014\n                            accept Jesus as the true Messiah or they \nmust be damned, literally.\u0014\n                            \"In my view, any theology that continues \nto deny the validity of\u0014\n                            Judaism and to fantasize about looking \nforward to the conversion or\u0014\n                            destruction of the Jews is one that \nshould arouse a great deal of\u0014\n                            caution among Jews,\" argues Gershom \nGorenberg, a leading\u0014\n                            Jewish expert. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            Yet when a people feels isolated and \nunder attack, it will take all the\u0014\n                            friends it can get, retorts Abraham \nFoxman, national director of the\u0014\n                            Anti-Defamation League. \"I don't think \nit's our business to get at the\u0014\n                            heart and soul and metaphysics of people \nas to why they come to\u0014\n                            support Israel.

    "title": "IRVING BERLIN:MUSIC AND MYTH",
    "words": "Irving Berlin: Music and Myth\u0014\nPeople Weekly, Oct 9, 1989 v32 n15 p63(3). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Irving Berlin died on Sept. 22, 1989, at age 101, a small group \nof people gathered outside his home on Beekman Place in New York City \nand spontaneously broke into song. The strains of \"God Bless America\" \nthat drifted down the street seemed a fitting tribute to the man who \nhad kept America singing for generations. Although Berlin himself was \nseldom seen in the last 20 years of his life, his music -- including \nsuch standards as \"White Christmas,\" \"Blue Skies,\" \"Always,\" \"Puttin' \non the Ritz\" and \"Cheek to Cheek\" -- continued to be heard. \"I was \ncurious about what had become of Berlin,\" says author Laurence \nBergreen, who has just completed a forthcoming biography for Viking \nPenguin, As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin. In 3 1/2 \nyears of digging, Bergreen found that many legends about Berlin were \nmyths. He separated fact from fiction with staff writer Mary H.J. \nFarrell. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was Berlin like in his last years? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was the Howard Hughes of show business -- a paranoid, reclusive, \ngenius tycoon. He was worth tens of millions when he died. He could \nhave earned a lot more if he had licensed his songs to movies or \ncommercials, but in later life he never did. When Steven Spielberg \nasked to use a song in a movie, Berlin said, no, he was going to save \nit for one of his own projects. He was 98 years old at the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow would he spend his time? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe talked endlessly on the phone to his friends -- composer Harold \nArlen, music historian Edward Jablonski, Morton Gould, president of \nASCAP. They would talk shop, and Berlin would carefully check on his \nroyalties. This gave Irving a sense of being in the thick of things. \nOf course, he wasn't. It was kind of poignant. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy was Berlin so concerned about money? \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Berlin's father died, his life underwent a revolution. He was \nthe youngest of six children. There was no money to support the \nfamily. At 13, he began singing popular songs of the day on the \nsidewalks of the Lower East Side. This was a Dickensian situation \nthat went on for four or five years. His equating music with money \nbegan then. For him music was a matter of survival. If he did it \nwell, he ate. If he didn't, he starved. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere there any recent Berlin sightings? \u0014\n\u0014\nFor the last six years, a group of fans have gathered outside \nBerlin's home on his birthday and at Christmas to serenade him. On \nChristmas Eve 1983, as they were singing \"White Christmas,\" the maid \ninvited everyone in for cocoa. Berlin was in the kitchen in his \npajamas. He hadn't made a public appearance since his 80th birthday \nin 1968. He said it was his loveliest Christmas present ever and gave \nall the men a hug and all the women a kiss. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo he was capable of being magnanimous? \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, and although he pinched his nickels and dimes, he could be \ngenerous. This Is the Army earned nearly $10 million, and he gave it \nall to the government. After Kate Smith made \"God Bless America\" \npopular in 1938, Berlin signed over the money to the Boy Scouts and \nthe Girls Scouts. \u0014\n\u0014\nWas it true that Berlin could only play the piano with one finger? \u0014\n\u0014\nNo. He was a crude pianist -- he only played the black keys -- but he \nused all 10 fingers. Because Berlin couldn't read or write music, he \nused an invention called the transposing piano. It had a lever that \nmoved the keyboard, changing the key signature. For him it was like a \nblind man learning to read with braille. \u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin was often charged with plagiarizing songs. Were the charges \nunfounded? \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a very persistent rumor that dogged him to his dying day \nthat his songs were written by black musicians in Harlem who toiled \nanonymously. This started with his first hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime \nBand\" in 1911. Many people believed it was impossible for one person \nto write as many songs in as many styles as he did or for an \nuntrained musician to write so many works of genius. Berlin, relying \non his ear, worried that something he had heard somewhere would crop \nup in his music. But no evidence has ever been found that he \nplagiarized anyone. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Berlin met his second wife, Ellin Mackay, what did her father \nobject to most -- the fact that he had grown up poor, was Jewish or \nwas in show business? \u0014\n\u0014\nEach was worse than the next. Clarence Mackay was a pillar of New \nYork society. He was an arrogant man who had inherited all his money \nand had no business sense himself. The romance never got going \nseriously until Clarence realized his daughter was dating this Tin \nPan Alley composer and sent her on a trip around the world to break \nit up. This was the worst thing he could have done because once she \nwas away, Irving began to miss Ellin and wrote \"Remember\" for her. \nShe returned in September 1925, and they married right after New \nYear's. When they met, Ellin was a journalist contributing to the New \nYorker. Irving had always been in awe of literature and higher \nlearning, which he felt had been denied him because of the poverty of \nhis youth, and that was part of his fascination with Ellin. He \nremained devoted to her until she died in 1988. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs it true he wooed her with \"Always\"? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe didn't write that for Ellin. An associate asked him to write a \nsong for his girlfriend, Mona. He worked out the tune and the line, \n\"I'll be loving you, Mona,\" on a napkin and put it away. A few years \nlater he pulled it out and substituted the word \"always\" for \"Mona.\" \nHe tried to use it in the play The Cocoanuts, but the director hated \nit. When he eloped with Ellin, he still had it in mind so he \ndedicated it to her and assigned her the copyright. Over the years it \nearned her $300,000. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of father was Berlin? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was absent too much to be a doting father. During World War II he \ntraveled with his show, This Is the Army. When he wasn't on the road \nhe worked at night, going to bed at 4 or 5 A.M. and sleeping until \nnoon. He had one son who died shortly after birth -- Irving Berlin \nJr. There were three faiths in the house -- Ellin was Catholic, \nIrving was Jewish and the three girls were raised Protestant, largely \nbecause Ellin was in favor of religious tolerance. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did Berlin do to relax? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was rarely able to relax. He tried fishing but didn't have the \npatience for it. He tended to brood and become unhappy when he tried \nto unwind. He was really only expansive in his work. \u0014\n\u0014\nWas he impressive in person? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was blunt and never lost his Lower East Side accent. And though he \nrevered learning, he was not an intellectual. Berlin was in London \nwith This Is the Army when he was invited to visit Winston Churchill. \nThe PM poured him a cognac and said, \"Mr. Berlin, can you tell me \nabout war-production figures in the U.S.?\" Berlin was staggered -- he \nexpected to talk showbiz. The less he said the more Churchill \npestered him about politics. It turned out Churchill thought he was \nIsaiah Berlin, the English scholar and diplomat. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Berlin wrote Mr. President in 1962, it was hailed as a comeback, \nbut from what? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late '50s he had a lot of career frustrations and lived alone \nin a separate apartment in his building for several years. He had a \nbad attack of shingles. After he recovered, everyone was delighted \nthat Berlin, then 74, was back. The problem was that Mr. President \nreceived such mixed reviews -- some terrible -- that it revived \nrumors that he didn't write his own stuff. Unfortunately, he had \nwritten it. After that, his confidence was shot. \u0014\n\u0014\nDid he understand how much he had contributed to American music? \u0014\n\u0014\nI'm sure he regarded himself as the greatest American songwriter, but \ninsecurity tormented him all his life. But at the same time he was as \nastonished as anyone that he was so successful. Underneath it all he \nwas just Izzy Baline from the Lower East Side who was utterly \ndependent on his audience to keep him happy. \u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

    "title": "IMAN PREACHES HATE TO PILOTS BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11",
    "words": "July 16, 2002, The New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nImam at German Mosque Preached Hate to 9/11 Pilots\u0014\nBy DOUGLAS FRANTZ and DESMOND BUTLER\u0014\n\u0014\nHAMBURG, Germany, July 11  The German police are examining the \nactivities of a former religious leader at a small mosque here who \npreached murderous hatred of the United States to Mohamed Atta and \nothers who planned and executed the attacks on Sept. 11.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe police and intelligence officials said the imam, whom they know \nonly by his surname, al-Fazazi, preached an unusually heated stream \nof anti-Western and anti-Jewish abuse at the mosque, called Al Quds. \nMr. Atta, the presumed organizer of the attacks and pilot of one of \nthe aircraft that hit the World Trade Center, attended the mosque, as \ndid other members of the Hamburg cell. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe German police have no evidence that Mr. Fazazi was involved in \nthe attacks on Sept. 11. But investigators are intrigued by the \nnumber of paths that cross his door. His hate-filled message, the \nfact that he left Hamburg before Sept. 11 and his ties with people \ninvolved in the attacks have all attracted the attention of the \nGerman police.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Fazazi said that \"Christians and Jews should have their throats \nslit\" and called on followers to \"fight the Americans as long as they \nare keeping Muslims in prison,\" according to videotaped sermons \nseized earlier this month in raids by the Hamburg state police on a \nbookstore two blocks from the mosque, the police said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndreas Croll, a senior antiterrorism officer with the Hamburg state \npolice, said that in the light of the videotapes, \"It is fairly easy \nto make the conclusion after these excerpts that this was a \nfundamentalist group, and this was the environment that Atta and his \nroommates were from.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Fazazi's name has not surfaced previously in the worldwide \ninvestigation of the attacks on Sept. 11, and he remains a mysterious \nfigure. German authorities said he was gone before they knew who he \nwas, and American investigators said they had little information \nabout him. It is not known whether Mr. Fazazi ever met with Mr. Atta, \nor other members of the Hamburg cell, outside the mosque. The \nplotters are known to have attended the mosque in 1998 and 1999 \nbefore Mr. Atta's departure for the United States in 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Fazazi has not been implicated directly in the attacks or charged \nwith a crime. His exhortation to slit the throats of Americans and \nJews would almost certainly be prosecutable under German laws against \nracist incitement, but German authorities were not aware of his call \nto murder at the time. Mr. Croll said Mr. Fazazi left Germany, \npossibly for Morocco, sometime before Sept. 11. He could not be more \nprecise.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterest in Mr. Fazazi, who is believed to be Moroccan, grew out of \nraids on July 3 in which the police detained an Atta roommate and six \nother men thought to be planning new attacks, Mr. Croll said. \nVideotapes of Mr. Fazazi's sermons were confiscated from a bookstore \ntwo blocks from Al Quds mosque as part of the raids.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police said they believed that the sermons offered a religious \njustification to the extremists who organized the attacks. Mr. Atta \nand two other suspected pilots of hijacked aircraft were among five \nArabs implicated in the attacks who attended Al Quds.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike some of the other conspirators, Mr. Atta came to Hamburg as a \nuniversity student in 1992 and gradually embraced a radical brand of \nIslam, people who knew him said. Authorities now believe that Mr. \nFazazi may have played a role in Mr. Atta's transformation into a \nsuicide pilot, but the stages of Mr. Atta's conversion from student \nto plotter remain unclear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe raids in which the sermons were discovered were a result of an \ninnovative computerized profiling technique being used by the Hamburg \npolice to identify hundreds of potential militants, some associated \nwith the Hamburg cell and Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda. There \nis no evidence that Mr. Fazazi himself had any link to Al Qaeda.\u0014\n\u0014\nProfiling, or singling out people on the basis of ethnicity, religion \nor race, is banned in some countries. The practice has raised concern \namong civil libertarians in the United States who criticized \nauthorities for rounding up 1,200 Muslims after Sept. 11.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut profiling is legal in Germany, and it is playing a major role in \nthe broader investigation by the police in Hamburg and elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scope of the inquiry in Hamburg was conveyed on a large wall \nchart in a room next to Mr. Croll's office at police headquarters. \nThe chart displayed photographs and names of about 30 Arabs suspected \nof ties to militants. Red lines diagramed their various connections, \nwith Mr. Atta and his Hamburg apartment at the top of the chart.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Croll said the police thought Mr. Fazazi was an imam at Al Quds \nmosque from the late 1990's to at least 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nA German intelligence official involved in the investigation said Mr. \nFazazi was emerging as a figure in events leading up to the attacks, \nbut he said the religious leader had not come under suspicion before \nSept. 11. \"We had a general lookout on the mosque, but what he was \npreaching came to us after he was gone,\" said the intelligence \nofficer.\u0014\n\u0014\nGerman law imposes sharp restrictions on the ability of authorities \nto investigate religious groups. Even when restrictions were eased \nafter Sept. 11, officials said such monitoring remained difficult. \nMr. Fazazi, as an imam, was a public figure, and videotapes of his \nmessage were openly on sale until earlier this month. Yet he came to \nthe attention of the German police only after the raids on July 3.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Fazazi must have been known within Hamburg's Islamic population, \nbut no one wants to talk about him now. Questions about the former \nimam were met with blank stares at Al Quds mosque and in the cafes \nand other mosques frequented by Muslim \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa. \nMany Muslims here are wary because of the attention from reporters \nsince Sept. 11.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Attawhid bookstore, where Mr. Fazazi's anti-Western sermons were \nfound, has remained closed since the police raided it on July 3. A \nsign taped to the window said the store was closed \"without \njustification.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bookstore owner was among seven men from Morocco, Egypt and \nAlgeria questioned by the Hamburg police after the raids because of \nsuspicions they were planning unspecified new attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of them, Abdelghani Mzoudi, 29, a Moroccan student, had come to \nthe attention of the police earlier because he shared the apartment \nwhere Mr. Atta and two other suspects in the Sept. 11 attacks lived. \nThe police said Mr. Mzoudi attended Al Quds and supported Mr. Atta's \ngroup, but he has not been charged with a crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe men were identified through the computerized profiling technique \nintroduced in Hamburg after Sept. 11, said Mr. Croll, director of the \nprofiling unit here.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police in Germany first used profiling in the 1970's to try to \nfind members of the left-wing Red Army Faction, which committed a \nseries of robberies and killings. But, coupled with a toughening of \nantiterrorism laws, its use against a particular religion has \nelicited caution this time around.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We need to pay attention very carefully that, in fighting this form \nof crime, we do not corrupt ourselves,\" said Dieter Wiefelsputz, a \nmember of Parliament from the governing Social Democrats. \"This is a \nride on the razor's edge.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Croll said the technique played an essential role in discovering \npotential terrorists in a population of about 120,000 Muslims in \nHamburg.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith information about the suspects in the attacks on the United \nStates as a base line, Mr. Croll and his team created a profile of a \npotential militant. He is a Muslim man, a student age 18 to 40, with \nlegal residence in Germany and origins in a country where religious \nmilitancy is rife.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing data from universities, the central registry of German and \nforeign residents of Hamburg and other sources, Mr. Croll said the \ncomputer program said 811 people matched the profile.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther analysis of where people lived and with whom they associated \nnarrowed the list of suspects. Among them were the seven men detained \non July 3, all of whom attended Al Quds and often met together at the \nbookstore.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police monitored their activities and conversations for weeks. \nThey said the men expressed a willingness to die for Islam and \ndiscussed plans to travel outside Germany. The police picked them up \nfor questioning though they had not yet discussed concrete plans for \nattacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree of the men refused to answer questions, and those who did said \nthey were only strong believers, Mr. Croll said. They were released \nwithout charges and remain under investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company | Permissions | Privacy \nPolicy\u0014",

Wheeler got off the highway at the next exit and soon \nfound a rundown gas station with just one gas pump. He asked the lone \nattendant to fill the tank and check the oil, then went for a little \nwalk around the station to stretch his legs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he was returning to the car, he noticed that the attendant and his \nwife were engaged in an animated conversation.

She readily admitted she did. They had gone to high school \ntogether and had dated steadily for about a year.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Boy, were you lucky that I came along,\" bragged Wheeler.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you had married him, you'd be the wife of a gas station attendant\u0014\ninstead of the wife of a chief executive officer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My dear,\" replied his wife, \"if I had married him, he'd be the chief\u0014\nexecutive officer and you'd be the gas station attendant.\"\u0014",

The second string quarterback was, let us say, limited. Oh, \nhe was\u0014\nathletic enough but unfortunately, his ignorance was only surpassed \nby his\u0014\nstupidity. The championship game was in progress, the score was tied, \nthe\u0014\nhome team had the ball, and the clock was ticking down. An opposing \nplayer\u0014\nbroke through the line of scrimmage and slammed the star quarterback \nto the\u0014\nground with such force that the signal-caller had to leave the game. \nTime\u0014\nwas running out. The coach had no choice but to put in the back-up. \nThe\u0014\nsubstitute trotted onto the field, huddled the team, and strode up to \nthe\u0014\nline of scrimmage. Surveying the opposing team, and much to everyone's\u0014\nsurprise, he changed the play at the line. The ball was snapped, the\u0014\nquarterback handed it off to the half-back who busted up the middle \nand sped\u0014\nall the way into the end zone with the winning touchdown! An amazing \nplay.\u0014\nMoments later, in the ecstatic dressing room, the coach grabbed his\u0014\nsecond-team quarterback by the shoulder pads and said, \"Son, that was \ngreat!\u0014\nHow did you know to call that play?\" The boy said, \"Uh, well coach, it\u0014\nweren't easy.

Cremation was the normal practice of \nGreeks and Romans.\u0014\n                      Many of them believed in the immortality of the \nsoul and saw no\u0014\n                      reason to give special attention to the body. \nHindus, with their\u0014\n                      doctrine of reincarnation, still practice \ncremation. At the other\u0014\n                      extreme were the Egyptians, who mummified their \ndead, preserving\u0014\n                      the corpse indefinitely.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the catacombs in Rome attest, the early \nChristians insisted on\u0014\n                      burying their dead. Christian gravesites were \ncalled coemeteria\u0014\n                      (cemeteries), which literally means \"sleeping \nplaces,\" reflecting belief\u0014\n                      in a future resurrection. Early liturgies for \nthe dead included the\u0014\n                      reading of Scriptures, prayers, hymns, and \nalmsgiving for the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Why were Christians so concerned about proper \ndisposal of the\u0014\n                      body? Here are four reasons: (1) The body of \nevery human was\u0014\n                      created by God, bore his image, and deserved to \nbe treated with\u0014\n                      respect because of this. (2) The centrality of \nthe Incarnation. When\u0014\n                      the Word became flesh, God uniquely hallowed \nhuman life and bodily\u0014\n                      existence forever. (3) The Holy Spirit indwelt \nthe bodies of believers,\u0014\n                      making them vessels of honor. (4) As Jesus \nhimself was buried and\u0014\n                      raised bodily from the dead, so Christians \nbelieved that their burial\u0014\n                      was a witness to the resurrection yet to come.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course, many martyrs were burned to death, \nbut Christians\u0014\n                      believed God would bring them forth unimpaired \nat the resurrection.\u0014\n                      \"We do not fear any loss from any mode of \nsepulture,\" declared\u0014\n                      Minucius Felix, \"but we adhere to the old and \nbetter custom of burial.\"\u0014\n                      In the context of the early church, when \ncremation was associated\u0014\n                      with pagan rituals and unbiblical beliefs, \nburial seemed to be a more\u0014\n                      loving and reverent way to bear witness to \nGod's ultimate victory over\u0014\n                      death.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But what about today? The first cremation in \nAmerica took place in\u0014\n                      1876, accompanied by readings from Charles \nDarwin and the Hindu\u0014\n                      scriptures. For many years, relatively few \npersons (mostly liberals\u0014\n                      and freethinkers) chose cremation. But that has \nchanged\u0014\n                      dramatically. Only 5 percent of Americans were \ncremated in 1962; by\u0014\n                      2000 it was 25.5 percent. In Japan, where \nburial is sometimes illegal,\u0014\n                      the cremation rate is 98 percent. The rise in \ncremations reflects many\u0014\n                      factors: concern for land use; the expense of \ntraditional funerals; the\u0014\n                      loss of community and a sense of \"place\" in \nmodern transient\u0014\n                      society; and New Age-type spiritualities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While the weight of Christian tradition clearly \nfavors burial, the Bible\u0014\n                      nowhere explicitly condemns cremation. Since \n1963 the Roman\u0014\n                      Catholic Church has permitted cremation while \n\"earnestly\u0014\n                      recommending\" burial as the preferred mode of \ndisposal. Billy\u0014\n                      Graham has noted (what Christians have always \nbelieved) that\u0014\n                      cremation cannot prevent a sovereign God from \ncalling forth the dead\u0014\n                      at the end of time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Bible should not be used as a proof text \neither for the necessity\u0014\n                      of burial or for \"cremation on demand.\" True, \nthere are several\u0014\n                      examples of cremation in the Old Testament \n(Achan, Josh. 7:25;\u0014\n                      Saul, 1 Sam. 31:12; the King of Edom, Amos \n2:1), but they involved\u0014\n                      God's judgment and curse. When Paul offered his \nbody to be burned\u0014\n                      (1 Cor. 13:3), he was speaking of martyrdom, \nnot cremation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Jesus said, \"Let the dead bury the dead,\" \nhe was describing\u0014\n                      the cost of discipleship, not the cost or \nmethod of funerals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The real question for Christians is not whether \none is buried or\u0014\n                      cremated but the meaning given to these acts. \nOur modern funeral\u0014\n                      customs tend to anesthetize us from the ugly \nreality of death with soft\u0014\n                      music, plush carpets, and expensive caskets.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Presbyterian preacher George Buttrick once \nsaid, \"There is\u0014\n                      nothing more incongruous than dressing up a \ncorpse in a tuxedo!\"\u0014\n                      Cremation, too, can be done in ways that \ndesecrate rather than\u0014\n                      respect the dead. For example, one can now \norder designer urns in\u0014\n                      which elements of a loved one's \"cremains\" are \nmixed with clay and\u0014\n                      glazed to create a piece of lovely pottery!\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whether final disposition is by burial or \ncremation, the Christian\u0014\n                      church should offer a funeral liturgy in which \nthe reality of death is not\u0014\n                      camouflaged, and the resurrection of the body \nis affirmed. We\u0014\n                      solemnize the departure of our loved ones by \nreminding ourselves that\u0014\n                      we brought nothing into this world, and that we \ncan carry nothing out.\u0014\n                      \"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; \nin sure and certain\u0014\n                      hope of the resurrection unto eternal life, \nthrough our Lord Jesus\u0014\n                      Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Timothy George is a CT executive editor and \ndean of Beeson Divinity School at\u0014\n                      Samford University.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2002 Christianity Today.

    "words": "Intelligent Design Battle Moves to Ohio\u0014\n\u0014\nOpponents say the movement is trying to do an end run around science.\u0014\nBy LaTonya Taylor | posted 08/23/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nOhio has become the latest front in the national battle over the \nteaching of origins in public schools. Advocates of Intelligent \nDesign (ID) theory are urging the Ohio State Board of Education to \nallow high school science teachers to present design theory alongside \nevolution. The board will vote on new guidelines in December.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntelligent Design theory says that the complexity of plant and \nanimal life suggests that a higher intelligence, rather than \nevolution, brought them into being. It does not attempt to name the \nintelligence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Dembski, author of The Design Inference, told Christianity \nToday that a challenge to evolution based on scientific rather than \nreligious principles would \"puncture [evolution's] myth of \ninvincibility.\" Dembski is associate research professor in the \nconceptual foundations of science at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhillip Johnson, a lawyer and author of Darwin on Trial, agrees. \"The \nimportant thing is the recognition by a state board of education that \nfreedom of thought and freedom of speech apply to this subject,\" \nJohnson told CT.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate in Ohio has intensified as the vote approaches. Lawrence \nKrauss, chairman of the physics department at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity in Cleveland, says the idea is \"poorly formulated\" and has \nnot been scrutinized in scientific journals. \"It's been promoted by \npeople who have philosophical leanings and wish to disguise them as \nscience,\" Krauss told CT.\u0014\n\u0014\nOhio would be the first state to add ID to its science standards, \nalthough similar debates have arisen in Kansas, Michigan, \nPennsylvania, and Nebraska. The state's current standards call for \nscience students to study \"changes over time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe science standards were up for a routine review when Robert \nLattimer, a Cleveland chemist, began to lobby for including ID.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawmakers in the Ohio General Assembly are considering two measures \nto weigh in on the issue. House Bill 481 would require that school \ndistricts include instruction on why origins science generates \ncontroversy. House Bill 484 would require that the General Assembly \napprove science standards before their adoption.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresidents of 15 Ohio colleges signed a letter in March urging the \nstate board to \"reject the concept of intelligent design creationism \nas a part of the science curriculum.\" Fifty-two Ohio scientists, \nmeanwhile, issued a statement opposing \"religious or anti-religious \nindoctrination\" in science classrooms and censorship of views \nchallenging evolution. It affirmed the importance of evolution but \nsaid students should be able to learn \"alternative scientific \ntheoriesin any area of inquiry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe board of Patrick Henry Local School District in Hamler, Ohio, \nvoted unanimously in April to include ID \"as appropriate for \ndiscussion in classrooms in addition to other scientific theories.\" \nJohn Hall, superintendent of the 1,200-student district, said his \nboard members were \"trying to influence this discussion at the state \nlevel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our teachers need to feel comfortable talking about the idea of \nthere being a designer,\" Hall said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a March letter to the Ohio board, U.S. Reps. John Boehner and \nSteve Chabot wrote: \"Public school students are entitled to learn \nthat there are differing scientific views on issues such as \nbiological evolution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for \nScience Education, says Intelligent Design \"has not been accepted by \nthe scientific community. They are trying to completely do an end run \naround the normal process of getting a scientific idea accepted and \njust go directly to high school.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlan Padgett, who has published books and articles on the philosophy \nof science and religion, says the ID movement may be turning \npolitical prematurely.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If [ID advocates] don't take the high road of principle here and \nprove the science first . there's going to be a backlash in the rest \nof American culture that's not Christian,\" says Padgett, a professor \nof theology at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. \"The church \nwill look like it's selling its brains in order to be Christian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDembski, however, argues that science often follows the political \nprocess. He says several mainstream scientific organizations receive \npublic funding, which in turn strengthens their ability to do \nresearch and spread their findings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't think you should really separate the political from the \nscientific,\" Dembski says. \"This could provide an opening that would \nget people interested in the topic. If there were funding down the \nline through political means, it would mean that students would start \nresearching and getting into it, and there would be more Intelligent \nDesign research.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnson predicts the school board's December vote will be \"favorable \nbut very close.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today. \u0014\nSeptember 9, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 10, Page 22\u0014",

    "title": "IS GENESIS THE BASIC FOR THE POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST?",
    "words": "Is Genesis a Blueprint for U.S. Policy in the Middle East?\u0014\nBY Robert Parham \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is no blueprint for U.S. foreign policy, despite what \nfundamentalist Christians say.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey believe the Bible is a literal blueprint for the nation's Middle \nEast policy. They have announced plans to mobilize 100,000 churches \nand one million American Christians to support Israel. Their leaders \ninclude Jerry Falwell, Oliver North, Ralph Reed and many less notable \nSouthern Baptists. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"God gave the land to the Jew,\" Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, \ntold Beliefnet.com. \"I didn't give it to them. It wasn't my land, it \nwas God's land. He gave it to the Jews.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother proponent is Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who told his Senate \ncolleagues, \"I believe very strongly that we ought to support Israel; \nthat it has a right to the land.\" Israel is entitled to the West Bank \n\"because God said so.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Look it up in the book of Genesis,\" Inhofe said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, what does Genesis say? \u0014\n\u0014\nGod directed Abram to \"the land of Canaan,\" according to Genesis \n12:1-5. In another verse, God said, \"To your descendants I will give \nthis land\" (Gen 12:7). In yet another passage, God said, \"For all the \nland which you see I will give to you and your descendants forever\" \n(Gen 13:15). Still another text records, \"I am the Lord who brought \nyou from Ur ... to give you this land to possess\" (Gen 15:7).\u0014\n\u0014\nBased mostly on these passages, fundamentalists conclude that the \nUnited States should advance God's promise of land to Abram, better \nknow as Abraham, and support Israel. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, what's the problem? The problem is biblical literalism. \nFundamentalists read selective passages literally. And yet, the Bible \nliterally does not map out the geography of the land of Canaan. \u0014\n\u0014\nDoes the land include only what the human eye can see? Genesis 13:15 \nreads, \"For all the land which you see.\" If one interprets the larger \npassage literally to be \"the land,\" then shouldn't the reference to \neyesight be read literally? If this is the case, Israel's current \nboundaries exceed the capacity of human eyesight.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr does the land include the geographical references in another \nbiblical passage? Genesis 15:18 reads, \"the Lord made a covenant with \nAbram, saying, 'To your descendants I give this land, from the river \nof Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThese boundaries would define Canaan as all the land between Egypt's \nNile River and Iraq's Euphrates River. If this passage is read \nliterally, does it mean the United States should urge Israel to \nliberate the territories occupied by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Turkey and \nIraq? \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what does one do with the Jordan Valley? Genesis 13:11 records \nthat Lot, Abram's nephew, \"chose for himself all the Jordan Valley.\" \nGods promise of land is to Abram and his descendants, not to Lot and \nhis family. The Bible provides no reference to the land reverting to \nAbram after Lot's death. To whom does this valley now belong?\u0014\nThe Bible speaks to all of life, teaching us about moral character \nand giving us guidelines for discerning social relations. But the \nBible offers no literal blueprint for American foreign policy in the \nMiddle East. \u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, a number of noted evangelical scholars and leaders have \nchallenged fundamentalism's misuse of the Bible to justify their \nnarrow theo-political agenda. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese mainstream leaders have said, \"Significant numbers of American \nevangelicals reject the way some have distorted biblical passages as \ntheir rationale for uncritical support for every policy and action of \nthe Israeli government instead of judging all actions--of both \nIsraelis and Palestinians--on the basis of biblical standards of \njustice.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter to President Bush, they said, \"An even-handed policy \ntowards Israelis and Palestinians does not give a blank check to \neither side, nor does it bless violence by either side.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCongregational leaders can counterbalance fundamentalism's \ndistortions with clear teachings about what the Bible really says \nabout \"the land.\" And truthfulness about the Bible may lead to more \npeace and security for all who live in the land.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is BCE's Executive Director, (Baptist Center for \nEthics.)\u0014",

    "title": "IS IT ETHICAL TO ATTACK IRAQ?",
    "words": "Opinion Roundup: Is Attacking Iraq Moral?\u0014\nChristian leaders disagree, too.\u0014\nBy Todd Hertz | posted 09/04/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nHouston had a major problem with mosquitoes in the 1950s. The city's \nmosquito control district told the public that repellent sprays could \nnot control the mosquito population. Instead, the office said \nHouston's only recourse was to drain its low-lying areas of water \nthat were serving as mosquito breeding grounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was in Houston last week and didn't see one solitary mosquito, \nwhich is amazing if you knew how Houston was,\" says Richard Land, \npresident of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious \nLiberty Commission. \"Like mosquitoes, if you're going to deal with \nterrorists you can't just swat them or use insect repellent. You have \nto drain the swamp. Saddam Hussein is one of the major swamps. The \nU.S. would be doing the world a favor and acting in the best interest \nof future citizens of the U.S. by removing Saddam from power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut would it be ethical?\u0014\n\u0014\nInside Washington, D.C., and around the world, a pre-emptive strike \non Iraq has been hotly debated. Saying that Hussein poses a threat to \nU.S. national security and peace in the region, some members of the \nBush administration believe that attacking Iraq is necessary to force \na \"regime change.\" This week, both Pakistan and Russia have condemned \nthe U.S. plans. The World Council of Churches last week urged the \nBush administration to halt its \"rush to war\" in favor of diplomatic \nmeasures.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity Today contacted several Christian leaders to ask what \ncircumstances would make a pre-emptive strike on Iraq the moral \noption. Most of those interviewed applied just-war theory to \ndetermine the situation's morality. However, two sources who do not \nsubscribe to the theory said any preemptive attack would be immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our Lord Jesus Christ said, 'If anyone strikes you on the right \ncheek, you turn him the other also,'\" said Miroslav Volf, professor \nof theology at Yale Divinity School. \"But President George Bush, who \nclaims to be following Jesus Christ, says, 'According to the gospel \nof Cheney and Rumsfeld, if you think someone wants to strike you on \nthe right cheek, hit him as hard as you can.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nVolf says that the motive behind the suggested first strike is not \nnational security but access to Middle East oil. \"We have to have \ncourage to look the truth in the eyes,\" he says. \"Now is the time to \nact. Once the war is started, then it becomes more difficult.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStanley Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics at Duke Divinity \nSchool, says that nations can slide down a slippery slope when \njustifying action by claiming it is a response to threats. \"As a \npacifist, I find this problematic,\" Hauerwas says. \"No country is \ngoing to tell you that it ever fought an offensive war. But if the \nU.S. attacks, it is an offensive move. Where does a nation draw the \nline?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust cause?\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder just-war theory, as commonly held, several criteria must be met \nbefore military engagement: It must be conducted by a proper \nauthority with just cause, right intentions, a reasonable chance of \nsuccess, and using means proportional to the ends.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources for this article agreed that if an operation in Iraq is \nlaunched, it would have to be carefully planned to limit noncombatant \ncausalities, be fought with moral means, and have a clear objective \nfrom the beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If all we do is blast out a regime and conditions of long-term civil \nwar are all that's left, then the operation can hardly be justified,\" \nsays Jim Skillen of the Center for Public Justice. \"Are the countries \naround Iraq prepared to work with us to make sure a better regime \ngets in, and not a worse one? Does the U.S. have the support of \nallies to do that while rebuilding Afghanistan? There has to be an \nagreement and not a presumption that the U.N. will pick up the work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOpinions differ, however, about whether the U.S. has just cause.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The burden of proof is high for anyone who would claim to act \npreemptively,\" says David Gushee, associate professor of moral \nphilosophy at Union University. \"Just-war theory is a paradigm to \nmake resorting to war law-governed and debatable in a public setting. \nIt establishes the basic perimeter that use of force must be the last \nresort. You never initiate an attack. It is a defensive theory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGushee says that for a nation to strike first it must show \nirrefutable proof of \"hostile intentions, massing of forces, or \notherwise clear evidence you are about to be struck.\" He says that in \nthe current situation, this is not the case, at least not by the \nevidence thus far presented to the public.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The threshold has not been reached,\" he said. \"In fact, I think that \nthe U.S. or Israel is more likely to suffer a catastrophic use of \nweapons of mass destruction if we attack Iraq first than if we were \nto use nonmilitary means to accomplish our goals.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert McGinnis, Family Research Council's vice president of policy, \nsays that two requirements must be met to justify an attack on Iraq: \nirrefutable evidence connecting Hussein to the attacks of September \n11 and proof that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are being \nprepared for imminent use.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you fulfill these, an attack is justified because we have been \nstruck and will be struck again,\" McGinnis told CT. \"The president \nhas an obligation to communicate why he is asking our nation to \nsacrifice, as well as why he is willing to sacrifice combatants and \ninnocents on the other side.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSkillen agrees that the U.S. has to prove imminent danger. However, \nquestions about Iraq's intent to attack other nations or use weapons \nagainst them, he says, have to be separated from the war on \nterrorism. Whether Iraq is planning to launch aggressive efforts or \nwhether it funds terrorism are two different issues that should not \nbe confused, Skillen argues.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn top of that distinction, he says, the U.S. has to prove why the \nneed for action is now urgent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Part of what has to be presented for further military action is an \nargument that we are no longer in a position to withstand Hussein \ndoing what he has always done,\" Skillen told CT. \"In other words, we \nneed to show that what we have been doing in the past is no longer \nsufficient? If we are not in a worse position than before, what has \nto be shown is not that he simply is an evil guy. We have to know \nthat the capability is there in his hands, is intended, or could be \nused tomorrow in a devastating way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Christian leaders say that the U.S. already has enough \njustification for an attack. \"We need to remind ourselves that we \nwere attacked on September 11,\" says Richard Land. \"An act of war was \ncommitted against us. If you are looking for just cause, we have \nalready passed that threshold.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe says that Hussein's refusal to allow weapon inspections and his \nprevious assassination attempt of former President Bush also \nconstitute grounds for preemptive strike. Land says the Iraq \nsituation passes just-war criteria of last resort and \nproportionality. \"The only way we will remove the threat is to remove \nHussein,\" he says. \"The human cost of not taking Hussein out and \nremoving his government as a producer, proliferator, and proponent of \nthe use of weapons of mass destruction means we can either pay now or \nwe can pay a lot more later.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLand told Christianity Today that the operation has moral ends. \"Our \ngoal is not to kill the Iraqi people. Our goal is not to impose a \ngovernment on the Iraqi people. Our goal is not to conquer and \nsubjugate the Iraqi people,\" Land says. \"Our goal is to remove a \nreally atrocious, war-crimes-committing dictator who terrorizes and \nenslaves his own people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRich Cizik, the National Association of Evangelicals' vice president \nof government affairs, told CT that Hussein's involvement with Al \nQaeda provides ample justification for attack. However, other \nqualifiers must precede invasion. For example, he says, Congress \nneeds to ratify the decision. This, along with building a coalition \nof allies, would signify proper authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Congress or other nations do not approve of a U.S. strike, it may \nbe a sign that it is not the moral option. Gushee told Christianity \nToday that ensuring that U.S. actions have the best motives is \nnecessary to maintaining the nation's character. \"I like thinking \nthat I live in a nation that exercises its tremendous power with \nmoral restraint,\" he says. \"Even though we were horribly victimized \non September 11, our character as a nation is still relevant. We \ncan't just do whatever we feel like doing in response to what was \ndone to us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTodd Hertz is assistant online editor of Christianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Integrity Deficit Disorder\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are some of the symptoms of integrity deficit disorder?\u0014\n\u0014\nA person who is afflicted with this disorder knows what's right but \ndoesn't\u0014\nfollow through and do what's right.  He or she makes a promise or\u0014\ncommitment, then fails to keep it. Thus when you meet a person with\u0014\nintegrity deficit disorder you're never quite sure if you can trust \nthat\u0014\nperson or not.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second symptom is also one of the causes: people who have integrity\u0014\ndeficit disorder live from the outside in rather than from the inside \nout.\u0014\nThey let their feelings and emotional responses of the moment govern \ntheir\u0014\nbehavior more than doing what's right regardless of their feelings of \nthe\u0014\nmoment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo put it another way, people with integrity deficit disorder are \nreactive\u0014\nrather than proactive.  Reactive individuals base their decisions and\u0014\nactions on the outward circumstances of the moment, what's going on \naround\u0014\nthem.  If someone is rude to them, they are rude in return.  They are\u0014\naffected by their social environment.  Reactive people build their \nemotional\u0014\nlives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of \nother\u0014\npeople to control them.  They let other people decide how they are \ngoing to\u0014\nact.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, reactive people are often affected by the physical \nenvironment.\u0014\nIf the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn't, they let it \naffect\u0014\ntheir attitude and their performance.  Worse still, reactive people \nblame\u0014\nwhatever happens to them on someone or something outside of them.  \nThey\u0014\nrarely take any responsibility for what's happened to them.  It's \nalways the\u0014\nfault of someone or something else.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the syndicated comic strip, FRANK AND ERNEST, two bums are sitting \nalong\u0014\na wall talking with each other.  One says to the other, \"Do you \nbelieve in\u0014\nfate?\"  The other replies, \"Sure. I'd hate to think I turned out like \nthis\u0014\nbecause of something I had control over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, proactive people carry their own weather with them.\u0014\nWhether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value\u0014\ndriven and if their value is to produce good quality work it isn't a\u0014\nfunction of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. Proactive \npeople\u0014\nalso do not let the social environment control their actions or \ndecisions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's where integrity comes in.  Having integrity is about behaving \nin the\u0014\nway you promised to behave even though the mood in which you made the\u0014\npromises has changed or the environment outside you has changed.  If \nyou\u0014\nhave integrity it protects you from your changing moods, desires and\u0014\nfeelings.  It even protects you from the changing moods of other \npeople.  It\u0014\nprotects you from saying you are going to something and then not \nfollowing\u0014\nthrough.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day Jesus told a story designed for people who have integrity \ndeficit\u0014\ndisorder.

    "title": "IS THE TNIV FAITHFUL IN ITS TREATMENT OF GENDER?   NO",
    "words": "Is The TNIV Faithful in Its Treatment of Gender? No\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical correctness puts pressure on translators to change details \nof meaning.\u0014\nBy Vern S. Poythress | posted 09/27/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical correctness can, I believe, influence Bible translation in \nspite of contrary intentions on the part of translators. The \ninfluence mainly affects details of meaning, so it may not seem too \nserious at first glance. But in the end it threatens the vital \ndoctrine of the plenary inspiration of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlenary inspiration means that the whole of Scriptureevery detail of \nmeaning, not just the main point or selected partsis the Word of \nGod. This doctrine comes from passages where Jesus affirms details of \nScripture: \"Not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all \nis accomplished\" (Matt. 5:18 ESV); and from passages like Proverbs \n30:5: \"Every word of God is flawless\" (NIV). In addition, the Bible \nindicates that we are under the authority of Jesus as our master, who \nspeaks to us through the Bible. Choosing which details in Scripture \nwe will accept makes us the master instead, undermining our relation \nto Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFather in Hebrews 12:7\u0014\n\u0014\nNow political correctness puts pressure on translators to change \ndetails of meaning that do not fit modern egalitarian (or feminist) \nexpectations. How? In Hebrews 12:7 the New International Version \nsays, \"Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. \nFor what son is not disciplined by his father?\" The TNIV changes the \nlast part: \"For what children are not disciplined by their parents?\" \nThe underlying Greek word is pater in the singular, which means \n\"father,\" not \"parent,\" and certainly not \"parents.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe official TNIV website nevertheless posted an essay defending this \nchoice, arguing that it avoids misunderstanding: \"Was he [the author \nof Hebrews] suggesting that girls never need disciplining?\u0014\n\u0014\nOr that a mother never should discipline one of her children, male or \nfemale, under any circumstances? These would be the clear \nimplications of a literal \ntranslation\"(www.TNIV.info/resources/evaluation.php).\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical Correctness\u0014\n\u0014\nWe see in these words a highly exaggerated fear of someone being \nexcluded. And this theme of alleged exclusion has an affinity to \npolitical correctness. Suppose Bill is an advocate of political \ncorrectness. He does not like father in Hebrews 12:7, because it is a \nmale term when a similar point could have been made with parents. The \nwording does not fit egalitarian ideology. How does Bill get this \nwording changed? He raises the fear that someone will misunderstand. \nHe objects passionately:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe word father includes male bias. Modern readers will misunderstand \nit as excluding mothers' discipline, or they will hear it as \noffensive or insensitive to women. To avoid this dangerous \nmisunderstanding, the translators need to eliminate the maleness. But \ndon't worry, the main meaning is still preserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do translators respond to Bill's argument? Translators need not \nhave any politically correct bias themselves. All they need to do is \naccept Bill's unproven argument that some readers will misunderstand \nor be offended, and then they must make a change. They must change \nnot only Hebrews 12:7, but also any verse that has a male example or \na male representative in its expression of a general principle. In \nquite a few cases, a male meaning is there in the original. But if we \ninclude it in the translation, Bill claims it will be misunderstood. \nMaybe he even tells a story of his young daughter who misunderstood \nthis kind of statement (not mentioning the fact that children \nmisunderstand hundreds of other correctly translated statements in \nthe Bible).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Bill has found a powerful recipe for excluding from the English \nBible anything that sounds politically incorrect because it uses a \nmale example to teach a general principle, even if that meaning is \nthere in the original Greek. In fact, the TNIV uses a policy of this \nkind: \"Among the more programmatic changes in the TNIV isthe \nelimination of most instances of the generic use of masculine nouns \nand pronouns\" (TNIV, \"A Word to the Reader,\" p. vii). Such masculine \nnouns include son and father in Hebrews 12:7.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, in Luke 17:3 \"if your brother sins\" (NIV) becomes \"If any \nbrother or sister sins against you\" (TNIV). Matthew 18:15 likewise \nchanges from your brother to a brother or sister. Jesus used a male \nexample to teach a general principle, but the TNIV makes it a double, \ngender-balanced example.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, Bill can manipulate Bible translators precisely because he \nknows that translators have legitimate concerns for avoiding \nmisunderstandings. He creates a false fear that people will think \"if \nyour brother sins\" does not apply to a sister who sins. Of course \nreaders know that it applies to a sister who sins, just as they know \nthat \"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife\" (Ex. 20:17) also \napplies to not coveting your neighbor's husband. But we should not \nchange the Ten Commandments to say, \"You shall not covet your \nneighbor's wife or husband,\" because that would be adding to the Word \nof God. Nor should we change brother to brother or sister in Luke \n17:3.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneric HE\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV policy also includes eliminating generic masculine pronouns, \nthat is, generic he. For example, 1 Corinthians 14:28 in the NIV \nsays, \"If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in \nthe church and speak to himself and to God.\" The TNIV changes it to \nsay \"and speak to God when alone.\" Now the Greek original \nunambiguously indicates the addressees: \"to himself and to God.\" The \nTNIV switches this to an indication of the circumstances (\"when \nalone\"). But now the TNIV excludes even the possibility that the \nspeaker can speak in tongues quietly to himself while in church \n(while not addressing the church and not disturbing the meeting), or \nthe possibility that in a small, private group each person might \nspeak to himself out loud.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo translation made before 1980 has when alone or anything like it. \nThe TNIV changed to when alone not because of any more knowledge of \nGreek or of the circumstances in Corinth, but because it had decided \nin principle to eliminate masculine generic pronouns.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur friend Bill can use the same arguments here as before. He warns \ntranslators about misunderstanding or offense from the expression \nspeak to himself and he tries to compel them to change this \npolitically incorrect speech. If they accept his arguments, they must \nchange every instance of generic he throughout the Bibleand there \nare thousands of cases altogether. Are you, reader, willing to have \nthe meanings of all these verses changed around in dozens of subtle \nways in order to eliminate generic he?\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider Matthew 16:2425:\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up \nhis cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose \nit, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"Those who want to be my disciples must deny themselves and \ntake up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their \nlife will lose it, but those who lose their life for me will find it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV converts singulars to plurals. The result has a similar \nmeaningbut not exactly the same. The word he refers to a single \nhuman being, used as an example of a principle applicable to all. But \nthe plurals those and themselves suggest a corporate meaning, where \nthe group as a whole, all its members together, have a single cross. \nTogether they \"deny themselves\"perhaps their identity as a group. \nThey have a single group life that they may save or lose. The TNIV \nrefuses to let Jesus teach by using an individual as an example, and \nJesus' focus on the individual application is blurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother kind of change appears in Luke 9:26:\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be \nashamed of him when he comes in his glory\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: If any of you are ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man \nwill be ashamed of you when he comes in his glory\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the TNIV the verse is no longer so clearly universal. Instead of \nspeaking of anyone throughout all ages, it says any of you, any of \nthe immediate people to whom Jesus is speaking at the time. Perhaps \nwhat he says to them is still generalizable, but how do we know? In \nthe TNIV, maybe it only applies to people who have followed Jesus, \nnot to anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider also 1 John 4:20:\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a \nliar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"If we say we love God yet hate a fellow believer, we are \nliars.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe generalizing anyone leaves open the real possibility that the \nmain trouble for John comes from a dissident group who had already \nwithdrawn (1 John 2:19). By shifting to we, the TNIV suggests instead \na focus on hypocrisy among the immediate circle to whom John is \nwritingwe who are in the church. This is a significant change of \nmeaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of examples of such changes can be found in the TNIV (see \nwww.no-TNIV.com). The whole series of changes rests on the key, \nunjustified assumption that generic he must be eliminated.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have concentrated on the disputed areas because this is the issue. \nBut it should be noted that some areas of the TNIV translation are \nnot in dispute. The TNIV sometimes improves on the NIV. To separate \nbetween the disputed and undisputed cases, I recommend that readers \nconsult the fullest treatment on the question, The Gender-Neutral \nBible Controversy: Muting the Masculinity of God's Words (Broadman & \nHolman, 2000) by Vern S. Poythress and Wayne A. Grudem.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor now, note these significant facts:\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneric he, though not as common as before, still occurs in major \nsecular publications.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt occurs even in pro-feminist literature, in the form of an \noscillating use, with generic she for perhaps one page and then \ngeneric he for two paragraphs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople do understand such usages, on an obvious level. (People even \nunderstand generic she when it is used to affirm a general principle \nthat includes men; some prefer this kind of expression, some do not.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneric he is not offensive or insensitive, if in the feminist \nliterature it is combined with equal time for generic she. The \noffense occurs if there is unequal time for male and female cases. \nThe offense is thus not a grammatical question, or a narrowly \nlinguistic question, or a question of misunderstanding, but a \ncultural question. Any pattern of thoughtnot mere grammarthat does \nnot show equal prominence for male and female is not acceptable to \nmodern egalitarianism. But neither does egalitarianism accept the \nfact that the Bible in the original uses male sample cases more than \nfemale (remember the father and son in Hebrews 12:7)! So the real \nproblem is that modern people can and will claim to misunderstand and \nbe offended because the Bible in the original does not match their \nexpectations and prejudices.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then shall we update the Bible in order to make it conform to \nmodern expectations and demands? Updating it makes it easier but does \nso by simply giving in to a modern prejudice. Meanings and thought \npatterns in the Bible are compromised. The plenary inspiration of \nScripture disappears in practice, because details of meaning are \nalteredalways under the claim of eliminating offense and \nmisunderstanding. But faithfulness to original meaning requires \nletting the Bible's innately offensive elements stand. Whether these \nare minor or major, the principle remains the same.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we give in at this point, further down the road we will give up \ncalling God Father, because this too is perceived by some as \noffensive. In fact, it is far more offensive than a generic he! If we \ngive in here, we should get ready to pray to \"Our Parent in heaven,\" \nbecause the new Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich Greek Lexicon, with no \nnew evidence, has already added the new definition Parent for Greek \npater when referring to God (p. 787).\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Strauss argues the opposite and responds to Poythress.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information.\u0014\nOctober 7, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 11, Page 37\u0014\n\u0014\nA Response to Mark Strauss\u0014\nThe TNIV Undermines Plenary Inspiration\u0014\nby Vern Poythress | posted 09/27/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main points that Dr. Strauss tries to make are not new, but have \nalready received a response in Vern S. Poythress and Wayne A. Grudem, \nThe Gender-Neutral Bible Controversy: Muting the Masculinity of God's \nWords (GNBC; Broadman & Holman, 2000; now online at \nwww.cbmw.org/resources/books and www.keptthefaith.org).\u0014\nDr. Strauss says that the TNIV makes improvements to the NIV, such as \nusing person or people when that is what the Greek means. But this \nhas never been the question under debate (see my approval of such \nchanges in GNBC, 9199, 197198). The question is not whether the \nTNIV got some things right, but whether it is faithful in the area of \ngenderand there are many places where it is not, verses with changes \nin meaning due to the gender-neutral policy stated in the TNIV \npreface.\u0014\nFor example, the TNIV changes father to parents (Heb. 12:7), son to \nchildren (Gal. 4:7; Heb. 12:7b; Rev. 21:7), and brother to fellow \nbelievers (1 Cor. 5:11; 2 Thess. 3:15; 1 John 2:10). This neutering \nof meaning conforms to political correctness. In all these verses, \nthe Greek is singular, and the singular form consistently carries a \nmale meaning that is dropped by the TNIV (GNBC, 251276; \"Analyzing \nToday's NIV,\" www.keptthefaith.org). Dr. Strauss confuses the \ndiscussion because, under the term inclusive, he unfortunately lumps \ntogether these cases that wrongly change a male meaning with cases \nthat rightly translate a Greek meaning that is already explicitly \ninclusive (GNBC, 9495, 115117).\u0014\nTNIV's systematic elimination of generic he also causes meaning \nchanges (GNBC, 111232, 335347).\u0014\nConsider Revelation 22:18:\u0014\nNIV: \"If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the \nplagues\"\u0014\nTNIV: \"If anyone of you adds anything to them, God will add to you \nthe plagues\"\u0014\nThe TNIV's change implies that \"you\" all will receive plagues for the \nsin of \"anyone of you.\" The TNIV obscures the meaning in the very \nverse that forbids tampering with God's Word! The TNIV removes the \nmasculine singular he/his/him/himself over 400 times (see \nwww.no-TNIV.com). Moreover, in Greek a generic masculine singular \ntypically suggests a male example, and is not purely gender-neutral, \nbecause the text will sometimes shift seamlessly from a generic \nmasculine to a specific male example (GNBC, 142145, 336339). \nContrary to Dr. Strauss's assumption, the match between Greek and \ngeneric he is very good.\u0014\nThe TNIV says of Jesus, \"He had to be made like his brothers and \nsisters in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and \nfaithful high priest\" (Heb. 2:17). Jesus did become fully human, \nidentifying with both men and women. But high priests were always \nmale. By adding sisters right after brothers, and following it with \nthe telling phrase in every way, the TNIV makes it sound as if Jesus \nis bisexual (male and female).\u0014\nSuch changes, though subtle in individual cases, accumulate to many \nmeaning changes in the whole. In the process, even though the \ntranslators did not intend it, plenary inspiration is undermined.\u0014\nMark Strauss responds to Poythress.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "IS THE TNIV FAITHFUL IN ITS TREATMENT OF GENDER? YES",
    "words": "Is The TNIV Faithful in Its Treatment of Gender? Yes\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV does not eliminate gender distinctions but rather clarifies \nthem.\u0014\nBy Mark Strauss | posted 09/27/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the negative press concerning Today's New International \nVersion comes from a misunderstanding of Bible translation and a \nmisrepresentation of the TNIV. Here are seven facts you should know.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal of the TNIV is the same as that of the NIV (and other \nversions): to render the meaning of the original text accurately into \ncontemporary English.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSince no word or phrase in one language corresponds exactly to any \nword or phrase in another, a strict literal or word-for-word \ntranslation is impossible. Anyone learning a foreign language soon \nrecognizes this. Translated literally, the Spanish phrase Cmo se \nllama? comes out something like \"How do you call yourself?\" But in \ngood idiomatic English it means \"What is your name?\" The words must \nbe changed to capture the meaning in English. The daunting task for \nBible translators is to find English words, phrases, and clauses that \ncorrespond as closely as possible to the meaning of the original text.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThough this controversy has focused on gender, about 70 percent of \nthe TNIV revisions are not related to gender but result from advances \nin biblical scholarship and the goal of greater clarity and \nprecision. A word-for-word translation of Matthew 1:18 would read \n\"she [Mary] was found having in womb from holy spirit.\" This literal \nrendering is impossible English, so the original NIV translated \"she \nwas found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.\" The TNIV \nimproves this by translating \"she was found to be pregnant through \nthe Holy Spirit.\" Since no English speaker today would use the \narchaic \"with child,\" the TNIV more accurately reflects the meaning \nof the original.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn line with this goal of accuracy, the TNIV is intentionally gender \naccurate. When biblical authors refer to both men and women, the TNIV \nmakes this clear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the Greek word anthropos can mean \"person\" (its primary \nmeaning) or \"man\" (a secondary sense), depending on the context. \nWhile the NIV translated Romans 3:28, \"For we maintain that a man \n(anthropos) is justified by faith,\" the TNIV more accurately renders, \n\"For we maintain that a person is justified by faith.\" Virtually \neveryone agrees that anthropos here means \"person,\" so the TNIV \ntranslates it that way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV does not eliminate gender distinctions (as some critics \nclaim) but rather clarifies them. References to females remain \nfeminine. References to males remain masculine. But when the inspired \nauthors are referring to both men and women, an inclusive term like \nperson is used. This is just good translation policythe kind of \nmeaning-based translation practiced by Bible translators around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV utilizes contemporary English for today's readers. The \nEnglish language is constantly changing, so Bible versions must be \nupdated periodically. Words in the King James Version like artificer, \ndiscomfited, wotteth, and staves are no longer understandable, so \ntranslators substitute contemporary terms.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile masculine generic terms like man, he, and brothers are still \nused today, empirical studies have shown that they are in serious \ndecline and are increasingly perceived by readers as exclusive. If I \nannounced to my church that \"the brothers are meeting for breakfast \ntomorrow,\" I doubt most women would feel included. The statement is \nambiguous at best. If we want Bible translations to be as clear and \naccurate as possible, then inclusive language should be usedwhen the \nmeaning of the text is inclusive.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou may ask, But why should we condescend to language changes \nproduced by our heathen culture? While this may reflect a legitimate \nconcern, history has demonstrated the impossibility of turning back \nthe language clock. It would be a mistake for me to announce that I \nwas \"gay,\" even if I clarified that I meant happy. I may be \nprotesting against language changes caused by homosexuals, but such \nprotestations are irrelevant if my words are consistently \nmisunderstood. Communication is most effective when we use today's \nlanguage to express eternal truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gender-accurate language of the TNIV is nothing new. In the last \n20 years, almost every English Bible produced or revised has used \ngender-accurate language. These include the New Revised Standard \nVersion, the Good News Bible, The Message, the Contemporary English \nVersion, and the New Living Translation among many others.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEven versions that arose in opposition to inclusive languagelike the \nEnglish Standard Versionrecognize these language changes and so \nutilize much inclusive language. In hundreds of passages the ESV \nrevises the RSV with gender-inclusive language (see my article on the \nESV's gender language at http://biblepacesetter.org/ \nbibletranslation/files/list.htm).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider Matthew 5:1112:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRSV: \"Blessed are you when men revile you\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nESV: \"Blessed are you when others revile you\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ESV is certainly far more gender inclusive than the NIV, which \nleads to the next point.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars on both sides of this debate recognize the legitimacy of \nmanyeven mostof the changes introduced in the TNIV. Though you \ncould hardly tell this from the sensationalistic news coverage, \nopponents acknowledge that the TNIV often improves the accuracy of \nthe NIV (see my article on TNIV improvements at \nhttp://biblepacesetter.org/bibletranslation/files/list.htm). We have \nalready noted that anthropos usually means \"person,\" not \"man.\" The \nplural anthropoi usually means \"people,\" not \"men.\" For example, \nMatthew 12:36: NIV: \"But I tell you that men will have to give \naccount on the day of judgment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"But I tell you that people will have to give account on the \nday of judgment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Greek plural noun adelphoi often means \"siblings\" or \"brothers \nand sisters.\" When used figuratively in the New Testament, it means \n\"fellow believers\" or \"brothers and sisters\" in Christ. For example, \nPhilippians 3:1:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars agree that hundreds of generic terms translated \"man\" in the \nNIV are more accurately rendered in the TNIV. For example, John \n13:35: NIV: \"By this all men (Greek: pantes) will know that you are \nmy disciples\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"By this all people will know that you are my disciples\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars agree that Greek pateres can mean \"fathers,\" \"parents,\" or \n\"ancestors,\" depending on the context. When former generations are in \nview, pateres is best rendered either as \"ancestors\" (for both men \nand women) or \"forefathers\" (for male ancestors). For instance, \nHebrews 3:9:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"where your fathers tested and tried me\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"where your ancestors tested and tried me\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLong before the TNIV debate, the King James Version recognized that \nGreek huioi often meant \"children\" rather than \"sons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, in Matthew 5:9:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nKJV: \"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the \nchildren of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"for they will be called sons of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"for they will be called children of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese examples represent the tip of the iceberg. Scholars on both \nsides acknowledge that in hundreds of verses the TNIV improves the \naccuracy of the NIV.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what about the claims of \"inaccuracies\" and \"distortions\" of \nGod's Word?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMost claims of TNIV \"distortions\" are based on linguistic fallacies. \nBecause of space constraints, I will respond to only two key \nobjections made in a widely circulated petition produced by opponents \nof the TNIV.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, \"The TNIV often changes masculine, third person, singular \npronouns (he, his, and him) to plural gender-neutral pronouns.\" The \nexample is Revelation 3:20:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"If anyone (tis) hears my voice and opens the door, I will come \nin and eat with him (autos), and he (autos) with me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in \nand eat with them, and they with me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOpponents claim that them and they lose the sense of individual \napplication and so distort the meaning. But the antecedent of the \nGreek pronoun (autos) is the inclusive indefinite pronoun \"anyone\" \n(tis), and so autos does not mean \"him\" (a male person), it means \n\"him or her.\" Pronouns derive their meaning from the words they \nreplace! The NIV is imprecise because it uses a masculine pronoun \ninstead of a true generic. English does not have a \nnon-gender-specific singular personal pronoun.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslators who wish to retain the singular can compromise by: (1) \nusing he or she (most accurate, but awkward); (2) using the masculine \npronoun he (see NIV), even though it is gender inaccurate (formally) \nand sounds exclusive to many readers; (3) using a plural pronoun \n(they) with a singular sense, which grammarians call the \"singular \nthey.\" This form, found in the TNIV, has been used in English for \nhundreds of years and is now widely accepted among grammarians. Few \nEnglish speakers would say, \"Everyone likes pizza, doesn't he?\" Most \nwould say, \"Everyone likes pizza, don't they?\" This is the same form \nused by the TNIV in Revelation 3:20.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis point reveals a second error in the petition. It claims the TNIV \nhere uses a plural pronoun, but in fact they is functioning as a \nsingular pronoun (the singular anyone makes this clear). Opponents \nare confusing form with function.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis form-versus-meaning fallacy is at the heart of the TNIV debate, \nand it surfaces again and again when opponents claim that the TNIV \ndistorts the meaning by changing certain forms, such as singulars to \nplurals. An example they use is 1 John 5:12:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"He who has the Son has life\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"Those who have the Son have life\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics claim that the TNIV could be misconstrued as referring to \ngroups. But no normal reader approaches English in such a wooden \nmanner. If I said, \"Those who pass this exam will pass the course,\" \neveryone would know I was speaking about individuals. The TNIV \nclearly means \"those individuals,\" which accurately reflects the \ngeneric meaning of the Greek.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics may counter that some meaning is still lost. But this is the \nnature of all translation, since no two languages are identical. \nCritics seem unwilling to acknowledge that words like he and man also \nlose some meaning by introducing male-oriented terms into generic \ncontexts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother objection in the petition claims, \"The TNIV inserts English \nwords into the text whose meaning does not appear in the original \nlanguages.\" The example is Luke 17:3:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      NIV: \"If your brother sins\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"If any brother or sister sins\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe petition complains that \"the word sister is not found in the \noriginal language.\" But this is a misunderstanding of the nature of \ntranslation. None of these words occurs in the original language, \nbecause the original language is Greek! The right question to ask is \nWhat do the Greek words mean in context? In fact, the TNIV is more \naccurate. Opponents claim that the singular adelphos cannot mean \n\"brother or sister,\" but this is simply wrong. Greek lexicons confirm \nthat one sense of adelphos is a \"fellow believer\" (that is, \"a \nbrother or sister\" in Christ) and numerous New Testament contexts \nillustrate this (see, for example, 1 John 2:911).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TNIV is not a \"politically correct\" version. Contrary to \nmisleading media reports, the TNIV does not slant the Bible toward a \nfeminist agenda. All members of the TNIV translation committee are \nevangelical scholars and most are complementarians, that is, \nconservatives on the role of women in the church. Their goal was not \nto produce a politically correct version, but to render God's Word \naccurately into contemporary English.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTo confirm this, readers need only consult TNIV passages related to \nmale headship and the role of women. Consider 1 Timothy 2:1112:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNIV: \"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not \npermit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be \nsilent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTNIV: \"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do \nnot permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must \nbe quiet.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the TNIV were driven by a feminist agenda, it would surely have \naltered this and other disputed passages (see Eph. 5:2223; Col. \n3:1819; and 1 Cor. 11:216, 14:3338).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I point out these basic facts, the most common response is So \nwhat's all the fuss? If the TNIV follows standard translation policy, \nif gender distinctions are not blurred but clarified, if \ngender-inclusive language is commonplace in Bible translation, if \nevery passage in the TNIV is exegetically defensible, if the \ntranslators were all leading evangelical scholarsthen why so much \ncontroversy?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer is certainly related to the heated debate over gender \nroles in the churcha debate that stirs strong emotions and divides \nevangelicals. We must beware, lest our theological convictions on \nthis issue cloud our good judgment and shared values on the nature of \nBible interpretation and translation. As we carefully study this \nissue together, let us reaffirm our unity in Christ and our common \ngoal of accurately and clearly communicating God's Word to all people.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nVern S. Poythress argues the opposite and responds to Strauss.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014\nOctober 7, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 11, Page 37\u0014\n\u0014\nA Response to Vern Poythress\u0014\nThe TNIV Preserves the Original Meaning\u0014\nby Mark Strauss | posted 09/27/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Poythress assumes that the guiding principle behind the TNIV is \nto avoid offense. This is wrong. The guiding principle is to \ntranslate God's Word as accurately as possible. I am sure that Paul's \ncondemnation of homosexual behavior, his commands for wives to submit \nto their husbands, and his assertion that the husband is the head of \nthe wife are just as offensive in the TNIV as in the NIV. The TNIV \ndoes not update the meaning of the text, but communicates the \noriginal meaning in today's language.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Poythress is concerned about losing \"details of meaning.\" So am \nI. This is precisely why the TNIV is needed. English has changed, so \nthat when people read the NIV's man, many hear male instead of Paul's \nmeaning, person. This is a significant loss of meaning. Thirty years \nago the NIV translators meant for words like man and brother to be \nunderstood generically. Generic means referring to people in general. \nThe problem is these words no longer sound generic to many readers, \npotentially misrepresenting the author's intention.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow a new twist: Dr. Poythress claims that these are not true \ngenerics at all, but male representative words, where a male example \nteaches a general principle. But he offers no evidence for this \ntheory, nor any criteria for determining when a passage is a male \nrepresentative. Then he claims the TNIV distorts the meaning by using \na true generic!\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Poythress repeatedly calls for the retention of Greek forms \n(person, number, etc.). But the NIV has always been a meaning-based \ntranslation (the philosophy of most international Bible translation). \nThe TNIV continues this tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nI should add that I do not believe the TNIV always gets it right. \nLike every translation, the TNIV was produced by fallible people \nwrestling with difficult interpretive decisions. Yet in every passage \nopponents cite, the TNIV represents a legitimate interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, scholars have long recognized that the Greek dative \nheauto in 1 Corinthians 14:28 probably means \"by himself\" (= \"when \nalone\") rather than \"to himself,\" since it stands in contrast to \"in \nthe church\" (see A. Robertson and A. Plummer, A Critical and \nExegetical Commentary on the First Epistle of St. Paul to the \nCorinthians [ICC; T&T Clark, 1911] 321; G. Fee, The First Epistle to \nthe Corinthians [NIC; Eerdmans, 1987] 693).\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Poythress's claim that the Greek \"unambiguously\" means \"to \nhimself\" is wrong. The same can be said of Hebrews 2:69, a passage \noften cited by TNIV opponents. As conservative a commentator as John \nMacArthur Jr. recognizes that Psalm 8 is cited in Heb. 2:67 with \nreference to humanity, and then applied to Jesus in verse 9 (so TNIV) \n(John MacArthur Jr., Hebrews [Moody, 1983] 45).\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a well-intended but misguided media campaign against the TNIV, \nthe tide seems to be shifting to a more thoughtful approach, with \nleading evangelical New Testament scholarsD. A. Carson (Trinity \nInternational UNIVersity), Craig Blomberg (Denver Seminary), Darrell \nBock (Dallas Theological Seminary), and othersweighing in with \nsubstantial scholarly papers (see www.TNIV.info). Books by Dr. Carson \nand myself also provide readers with linguistic tools to investigate \nthis issue (Mark L. Strauss, Distorting Scripture? The Challenge of \nBible Translation and Gender Accuracy [InterVarsity Press, 1998]; D. \nA. Carson, The Inclusive Language Debate: A Plea for Realism [Baker, \n1998]).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn time this translation controversy will passlike those surrounding \nJohn Wycliffe, William Tyndale, and others. And through it all, \ntranslators will continue the challenging task of rendering God's \nWord into the language of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nVern S.

    "words": "The New Politics of Pot\u0014\nCan it go legit? How the people who brought you medical marijuana \nhave set their sights on lifting the ban for everyone\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Joel Stein | Las Vegas\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted Sunday, October 27, 2002; 10:31 a.m. EST, Time Magazine\u0014\nThe drug czar is ready for pro wrestling. He already has the name, \nand now he's got the prefight talk down cold. In every speech he \nmakes in Nevada, where Bush appointee John Walters has traveled to \nfight an initiative that would legalize marijuana, he calls out his \nthree sworn enemies as if he were Tupac Shakur. The czar has a \nproblem with billionaire philanthropists George Soros, Peter Lewis \nand John Sperling, who have bankrolled the pro-pot movement, and he \nwants everyone to know he's ready for battle. At an Elks lodge \nmeeting in Las Vegas, he ticks off their names and says, \"These \npeople use ignorance and their overwhelming amount of money to \ninfluence the electorate. You don't hide behind money and refuse to \ntalk and hire underlings and not stand up and speak for yourself,\" he \nsays. By the end of a similar speech at a drug-treatment center in \nReno, he says, \"Let's stop hiding. I'm here. Where are you?\" The czar \nis bringing it on.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the new czar was appointed in December, it was the \ngovernment's preference not to address the legalizers. But the \npro-pot movement has gained so much ground they can't be ignored as a \nfringe element. Americans, it turns out, aren't conflicted in their \nattitude toward marijuana. They want it illegal but not really \nenforced. A Time/CNN poll last week found that only 34% want pot to \nbe totally legalized (the percentage has almost doubled since 1986). \nBut a vast majority have become mellow about official loopholes: 80% \nthink it's O.K. to dispense pot for medical purposes, and 72% think \npeople caught with it for recreational use should get off with only a \nfine. That seeming paradox has left a huge opening for pro-pot people \nto exploit. Eight states allow medical marijuana, and a handful of \nstates have reduced the sentences for pot smokers to almost nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe midterm election Nov. 5 has lighted up the issue even more. While \ncontrol of the House hangs in the balance and the race for the Senate \nis a dead heat, the political trend for marijuana is clear: support \nis gaining. The most interesting battles on the November ballot are \nover pot initiatives: to allow the city of San Francisco to grow and \ndistribute medical marijuana, to replace jail with rehab in Ohio and \ndecriminalize marijuana use in Arizona. Many of these proposals are \nrelatively modest, but the pro-pot forces are also raising the \nstakes. In spite of the electorate's contentment with the paradox of \nloose enforcement, some particularly powerful people on both sides \nhave taken extreme viewpoints in an effort to end the political \nstalemate and force Americans to choose. Either pot is not so bad and \nshould be legal, or people should be arrested for smoking it. The \nbattlefield for the showdown is Nevada, where Question 9 would allow \nadults to possess up to 3 oz. of pot for personal use. In fact, the \nstate government would set up a legal market for buying and selling \npot. To almost everyone's surprise, the race is too close to call.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the pro-pot forces have pushed their agenda at the polls, \nopponents have tried to use legal muscle to fight back. After a \nSupreme Court decision last year reiterating that federal drug laws \ntrumped state ones, the Drug Enforcement Administration sent federal \nagents to California to bust medical-marijuana growers, a move that \ntended to outrage California voters who had approved this use. In \nfact, as the Administration pushes harder against the pro-pot forces, \npot supporters seem to gain ground.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the biggest pro-pot players, medical marijuana was actually \nkind of a ruse. Sure, there are sick people who really feel they need \nmarijuana to numb pain, relieve the eye pressure of glaucoma, calm \nmuscle spasms or get the munchies to help with AIDS wasting (see \nfollowing story). But they are not the people who put the debate into \nhigh gear. A few years ago, the Drug Policy Alliancean organization \nfounded by billionaire philanthropist Soros, who wants to legalize \nmarijuana and reform drug laws by replacing jail time with \nrehabdecided it would fund only those initiatives that could be won. \nSo the group ran a bunch of polls to find out how America feels about \nthe drug wars, and the reformers came up way short on everything but \nthree policies: people preferred treatment over incarceration in some \ncases, people hated property forfeiture, and an overwhelming majority \nfelt medical marijuana should be legal. So Soros & Co. set out to get \nmedical-marijuana legislation. The fight has done quite well, \nespecially when, to their surprise, the Federal Government took the \nbait and started arresting little old ladies and storming peaceful \npot-growing cooperatives. In fact, the pro-pot people have done well \nenough that some of them feel it is time to drop the ruse and fight \nfor full legalization. Plus, with Britain experimenting with a \"seize \nand warn\" policy instead of arresting pot smokers and Canada flirting \nwith doing the same, the blunt-friendly were ready to take off the \ncamouflage and fight. And where else to try this but in Nevada?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's why the czar is in Vegas, sitting in a room at the Venetian \nHotel guarded by U.S. marshals. The czar, a smart, likable, earnest \nman who believes he can help Americans by fighting the drug war, is \nderided by the opposition as \"Bill Bennett's Mini-Me.\" Indeed, he \nworked for Bennett under Reagan in the Department of Education and \nthen as Bennett's deputy drug czar in the first Bush Administration. \nWhen George W. appointed him, the President told the czar to watch \nthe movie Traffic as a way to understand the problem. The czar, who \ntold Time he has never smoked pot, believes marijuana to be not only \na gateway drug but also incredibly detrimental in its own \nrightcausing driving accidents, domestic violence, health risks and \ncrippling addiction. He thinks the legalization argument is absurd, \nespecially when proposed by libertarian Republicans who are so \ndoctrinaire he finds them to be outside his party. \"This is great \ntalk at 2 a.m. in a dorm room, that all laws should be consistent. \nBut the real world isn't consistent. It's ludicrous to say we have a \ngreat deal of problems from the use of alcohol so we should multiply \nthat with marijuana,\" he says. It doesn't take long for him to get \nback to the three billionaires: \"It's unprecedented, the amount of \nmoney put in by such a small amount of people over one issue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe marijuana legalizers, including the billionaires Walters \nvilifies, don't have much kinder things to say about him. In fact, \nfor old rich men, they can sound a lot like Tupac. One of them, \nSperling, 81, is founder of the highly profitable nationwide chain \nthe University of Phoenix. He has spent $13 million on drug-reform \ncampaigns and lots of other money on other pet projects, including \ncloning his cat. \"Mr. Walters is a pathetic drug-war soul who is \ndefending a whole catalog of horrors he's indifferent to,\" Sperling \nsays from his office in Phoenix, Ariz. \"The government's drug-reform \npolicy is driven by a Fundamentalist Christian sense of morality that \nsees any of these illegal substances used as evil.\" Sperling says he \nsmoked pot to combat pain associated with the cancer he fought in the \n1960s.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis, 68, former CEO of Progressive, an insurance company, doesn't \ndespise the czar quite as much, but he has been battling him even \nharder. The reasons for Lewis are more straightforward. He has been \nreferred to by colleagues as a \"functional pothead.\" He spends half \nthe year on a $16.5 million, 255-ft. yacht, where he smokes pot \nregularly; he even got arrested in New Zealand on drug charges a few \nyears ago, he told the Plain Dealer. He is one of the main backers of \nthe radical Nevada proposal, having given heaps of money to the \nMarijuana Policy Project, which is running Question 9 there. \"The \nabsurdity of its illegality has been clear to me for some time. I \nlearned about pot from my kids and realized it was a lot better than \nScotch, and I loved the Scotch. Then I went to my doctor, and he \nsaid, 'I'm thrilled. You're drinking too much. You're much better off \ndoing pot than drinking.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSoros (who has smoked pot but no longer does) declined to be \ninterviewed, and like the rest of the troika, he won't debate \nWalters. They are probably refusing for two reasons: 1) they would \nlikely lose, since none of them are politicians; and 2) if you were \ngoing around the world on a 255-ft. yacht, would you list \"Drug Czar\" \nas one of your ports of call?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo instead they fight federal policy with initiative after \ninitiative, while also defending local pro-pot laws. Their side got a \nmajor media boost in California in September, when federal agents \nbusted Santa Cruz's Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in an \nearly-morning raid. The feds dragged the farm's owners, who were \nlegally growing pot under California law, to a federal building in \nSan Jose for breaking federal law and held a paraplegic resident at \nthe farm for hours. \"I opened my eyes to see five federal agents \npointing assault rifles at my head. 'Get your hands over your head. \nGet up. Get up.' I took the respirator off my face, and I explained \nto them that I'm paralyzed,\" said Suzanne Pheil, 44, who is disabled \nby the effects of postpolio syndrome. Her story was broadcast \neverywhere, since the pro-pot people had basically been waiting for \nher to be harassed, punching every phone number on their media list \nminutes after the raid. Pot people, surprisingly, can move pretty \nfast when they want to.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bust couldn't have gone better for the pot folks. California \nattorney general Bill Lockyer fired off an angry letter to DEA chief \nAsa Hutchinson, who wrote back saying that federal law allows the \nfeds to seize pot. \"During the Clinton years they didn't do this,\" \nsays Lockyer. \"It disappointed me that they would be using precious \nresources to act like a bunch of bullies.\" San Jose police chief \nWilliam Lansdowne was so annoyed by the raid that he withdrew his \nofficers from the local DEA task force, ending 15 years of close \nwork. Even Governor Gray Davis, who has been quiet on the marijuana \nissue, expressed concern over the feds' bust. A week after the raid, \nSanta Cruz officials gathered at city hall to supervise public \ndistribution of marijuana to members of the Wo/Men's Alliance for \nMedical Marijuana in front of TV crews, a way of giving Washington \nthe finger.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo many Republicans, this looks like bad politics for Bush. \"It seems \nto me about as far from Compassionate Conservatism as you can get,\" \nsays former Nixon and Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger. \"There are an awful \nlot of people in their 50s and younger who smoked pot when they were \nyounger and don't look on it as something that destroyed their lives. \nI think there is a lot more open-mindedness toward pot than there \nused to be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Nevada, popular Republican Governor Kenny Guinn refuses to take a \nstand on Question 9, the pot-legalization amendment to the state \nconstitution, saying he'll go with whatever the people vote for. And \nhe won't really have to worry about it for a while, since the \nconstitutional amendment will go into effect only if Nevadans vote \nyes on Nov. 5 and again in 2004. So Guinn may be smart to stay out of \nthe debate, because the rhetoric from both sides has gone out of \ncontrol. The drug czar's latest commercial, which was actually \nfocus-grouped with teens and their parents, shows two teens getting \nstoned in their father's study, talking apathetically about a bunch \nof stuff. One pulls out a gun from his dad's drawer, the other asks \nlazily if it's loaded, and the gun-toting teen shrugs and shoots the \nother kid. \"The suggestion is not to say too many children are being \nshot in their dens who are marijuana users,\" Walters said. \"It's \nmeant to show that marijuana alters your ability to use judgment.\" In \nthe other camp, many of the workers lied to voters in the course of \ngathering signatures to get Question 9 on the ballot, saying it was a \nmedical-marijuana proposition, according to several pro-pot Nevadans. \nThe two camps even fight regularly about how many joints can be made \nfrom 3 oz. of pot, the proposed legal maximum. The pro-pot people \nclaim 80, while the anti-pot people carry around bags of 250 joints \nto illustrate their case. Yes, moms across the state are spending \nlarge parts of their nights rolling parsley and oregano.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Marijuana Policy Project in Nevada has a chance partly because it \nis far better organized than its scattered opposition. The project \nmade a smart move in hiring Billy Rogers, a Democratic political \nconsultant from Texas, to run the Nevada campaign. Rogers sends \npeople door to door daily to target supporters he can call on \nElection Day and bus to voting booths. This could make the difference \nin what the polls show is an almost evenly split electorate. Rogers' \noffice is situated in a Vegas strip mall, just above an Asian massage \nparlor, which is right next to a children's tutoring center, which is \nall you need to know to understand why the project is staging this \nfight in Nevada. The office looks more like a sorority fund drive \nthan a '60s dorm room. Posters drawn by children depict images like a \nteddy bear with a heart labeled vote yes on 9. Rogers, wearing a \ncollarless white shirt, is still at work at 1 a.m., editing a \ncommercial. \"In college we'd sit around and talk about thisthat when \nwe grew up we were going to change these laws. And now we're doing \nit,\" he says. Rogers, who says he hasn't smoked pot in 15 years, \ndoesn't have a personal connection to the fight, but it's pretty easy \nto get him into a James Carville mood. When he talks about Walters' \noft repeated claim (an assertion shared by the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse) that marijuana has much higher levels of \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) than it used to, that, in Walters' words, \n\"it's not your father's marijuana,\" Rogers goes ballistic. \"It's a \nplant. Whatit's not your father's broccoli? Its genetic structure \nhasn't changed in 30 years,\" he says, eating steak for a late-night \nmeal. \"These guys will say anything. If I had a billion-dollar \nbudget, I'd say anything to stay in business.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's one of the major conspiracy theories of the pro-legalization \nmovementa rant right out of the Eisenhower era, that the government \nis keeping pot illegal so it can maintain its giant drug-war \nbureaucracy. Its advocates also believeas put forth directly in the \npro-medical marijuana commercials of billionaire independent New York \ngubernatorial candidate Tom Golisanothat politicians are in the \npocket of the pharmaceutical companies, who fear marijuana is such \ngood medicine that their own products will suffer. The \npro-legalization forces also believe, more convincingly, that the \nright wing of the Republican Party connects drug use with sin and \nradicalism and the failure of the family. \"I've known John Walters \nfor about 10 years, and I don't think this is about drugs for him,\" \nsays Ethan Nadelmann, head of the Drug Policy Alliance. \"John is a \nreactionary ideologue. It's the broader battle about what we tell \nkids about life. It's a vehicle for promoting a tougher, meaner \napproach to life and government.\" Democratic Congressman Barney Frank \nof Massachusetts claims the war on drugs is really a war against the \nOther. \"Alcohol does more damage in many areas of society than drugs, \nparticularly marijuana, but we treat marijuana as much worse, and \nthat's because it's associated with the counterculture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Republicans, however, are ready to legalize medical marijuana. \nTexas Congressman Ron Paul, a doctor and onetime Libertarian Party \npresidential candidate, has been fighting for medical marijuana. \n\"From a humanitarian standpoint, people should never be denied this \nkind of help,\" says Paul. But fellow Republican Hutchinson stands \nbehind the decision to prosecute. \"Why would they want to authorize \nbehavior under state law that is still a violation of federal law?\" \nhe says. \"It endangers a population, to me. It gives the green light \non the one hand and a go-to-jail ticket on the other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong cops and other law enforcers, there are sharp divisions too. \nSome, like Joseph D. McNamara, a former San Jose police chief and now \na Hoover Institution fellow, call for an end to the criminalization \nof marijuana. \"Most of the police officers I hired during the 15 \nyears I was police chief had tried it,\" says McNamara. Like many pot \nlegalizers, he believes the system, which he says arrests more people \nfor marijuana than for any other drug, is racist. \"Ninety million \nAmericans have tried marijuana. When you look at who's going to jail, \nit is overwhelmingly disproportionateit's Latinos and blacks.\" Not \nsurprisingly, the topic is radioactive in the police profession. Andy \nAnderson, who was head of his state's largest cop organization, the \nNevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs, announced that his board \nmembers unanimously supported the pro-pot initiative so they could \nfocus on more serious crimes. A few days later, Anderson was forced \nto resign. The voice for Nevada cops then became Gary Booker, deputy \ndistrict attorney in charge of the vehicular-crimes unit, until he \ntold members of the press he believed the wild claims of political \nextremist Lyndon LaRouche that Soros is pro-legalization because he \nbankrolls drug cartels. When talking to Time at the Elks lodge where \nhe introduced the drug czar, Booker awkwardly tried to explain away \nhis statement: \"The word cartel was used, not drug. A cartel is a \ngroup of businessmen who control price, and that's what we've got \nhere. Three or four guys are controlling the thing.\" He too stepped \nout of the role of Nevada police spokesman.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pro-pot people feel that victoryeven if it comes not this year \nand not in Nevadais inevitable. Each year there are fewer members of \nthe pre-boomer generation, who tend not to distinguish between heroin \nand pot. In 1983, only 31% of Americans surveyed had tried pot; the \nnew Time/CNN poll puts the figure at 47%. And though pot use among \nteens is down from its '70s highs, parents sneaking joints when their \nkids are asleep is a fresh phenomenon. But the polls show that \nAmericans still cling to pot's forbidden status, which is why the \npro-pot people are working so hard. \"You would think you would get a \nchange, but you're not going to,\" says Charles Whitebread, a law \nprofessor at the University of Southern California who has written \nextensively on marijuana law. \"Even though it did nothing to them, \nthe fear that it will somehow pollute their children has made some of \nthe people who used marijuana extremely freely now say, 'Oh, gee, I \nwouldn't be in favor of the change in the legal status of \nmarijuana.'\" It may be that the major dividing line between the pro- \nand anti-legalizers is not party affiliation but parental status. And \neven among parents, moms see more against pot than dads.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, barring another wave of '60s-like radicalism or a lot more poorly \nthought-out co-op busts by the feds, Americans' complicated feelings \nabout pot aren't going to be reconciled overnight. And recent studies \nshowing that marijuana can have addictive properties, though in a \nsmall percentage of cases, is going to make some parents more nervous \nabout their kids turning into potheads. While alcohol and cigarettes \nmay be more dangerous, a lot of parents would rather smell \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein on their \nkid's breath than have a 29-year-old living at home, eating Cheetos \nand watching SpongeBob.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith reporting by Matt Baron/Chicago, Laura A.

    "words": "Is Pot Good For You?\u0014\nWell, no. But the latest research suggests the health risk from \noccasional use is mild, and it might ease certain ills\u0014\n\u0014\nBy John Cloud | San Francisco\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted Sunday, October 27, 2002; 10:31 a.m. EST\u0014\nI never smoked pot in junior high because I was convinced it would \nshrivel my incipient manhood. This was the 1980s, and those stark \nthis-is-your-brain-on-drugs ads already had me vaguely worried about \nmemory loss and psychosis. But when other boys said pot might affect \nour southern regions, I was truly terrified. I didn't smoke a joint \nfor the first time until I was 21.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 12th grade, about half of young Americans have tried marijuana, \nwhich put me in the geeky other half. I used to think this was a good \nthing, since I never developed a taste for pot and avoided becoming \ndependent. But as the medical-marijuana movement flowered and weed's \np.r. improved, I often wondered if I shouldn't have relished it as a \nkid, before I had a personal trainer to tsk-tsk my every vice. \nShrinking testicles? Mushy brains? I came to see these as \ngrotesqueries invented by antidrug propagandists.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt turns out that the study of marijuana's health effects is at once \nmore complex and less advanced than you might imagine. \n\"Interpretations [of marijuana research] may tell more about [one's] \nown biases than the data,\" writes Mitch Earleywine in Understanding \nMarijuana: A New Look at the Scientific Evidence, published in August \nby Oxford. For example: \"Prohibitionists might mention that THC \n[delta-9 tetra-hydrocannabinol, the smile-producing chemical in pot] \noften appears in the blood of people in auto accidents. Yet they \nmight omit the fact that most of these people also drank alcohol. \nAntiprohibitionists might cite a large study that showed no sign of \nmemory problems in chronic marijuana smokers. Yet they might not \nmention that the tests were so easy that even a demented person could \nperform them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe science of marijuanaespecially its potential medical usesis \nmalleable because it's so young and so contradictory. Although \npreliminary data are promising, scientists haven't definitively shown \nthat the drug can safely treat nausea or pain or anything, really. \nSome experts claim the U.S. government has sabotaged \nmedical-marijuana research, and there is evidence to support them. \nEven so, in the past few years scientists have made rapid advances in \ntheir basic understanding of how Cannabis sativa works. By 1993, \nresearchers had found the body's two known receptors for \ncannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals in the plant (thc is the \nmain one, but there are at least 65 others). Since then, there has \nbeen important new work in several fields that users, potential users \nand former users should know aboutand that voters should take into \naccount before deciding whether to legalize pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo much new research has appeared that in November the Journal of \nClinical Pharmacology and the National Institute on Drug Abuse will \npublish a 100-page supplement devoted entirely to marijuana. The \nJournal gave Time an advance look; it's a comprehensive review that \nwill annoy both sides in the drug war. You won't find clear evidence \nthat pot is good or evil, but the research sheds light on some of the \nmost important questions surrounding the drug:\u0014\n\u0014\nCan it kill you?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one has ever died of THC poisoning, mostly because a 160-lb. \nperson would have to smoke roughly 900 joints in a sitting to reach a \nlethal dose. (No doubt some have tried.) But that doesn't mean pot \ncan't contribute to serious health problems and even deathboth \nindirectly (driving while stoned, for instance) and directly (by \naffecting circulation, for example). A paper published last year in \nthe journal Angiology found 10 odd cases in France of heavy herbe \nsmokers who developed ischemia (an insufficient blood supply) in \ntheir limbs, leading in four cases to amputations. It's not clear \nthat marijuana caused the decreased blood flow, but the vascular \nproblems did worsen during periods of heavy use. Another 2001 paper, \nin Circulation, found a nearly fivefold increase in the risk for \nheart attack in the first hour after smoking marijuanathough \nstatistically that means smoking pot is about as dangerous for a fit \nperson as exercise.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it make you sick?\u0014\n\u0014\nMarijuana may directly affect the immune system, since one of the \nbody's two known receptors for cannabinoids is located in immune \ncells. But the nature of the effect is unclear. A recent study showed \nthat THC inhibits production of immune-stimulating substances. But \ncigarette smokers may do greater harm to their immunity than pot \nusers, who tend to smoke less. A study published earlier this year \nfound that tobacco smokers but not marijuana smokers had high levels \nof a type of enzyme believed to inflame the lungs. Dr. Donald Abrams, \nprofessor of clinical medicine at the University of California, San \nFrancisco, found that short-term cannabis use doesn't substantially \nraise viral loads of HIV patients. (People with HIV sometimes smoke \nmarijuana to stimulate appetite.) In fact, his study participants who \nsmoked pot enjoyed significantly higher increases in their \nlymphocytes (cells that help fight disease) than those who took a \nplacebo.\u0014\nCan it give you cancer?\u0014\n\u0014\nData on cancer also generate mixed conclusions. A 1999 study of 173 \npatients with head and neck cancers found that pot smoking elevated \nthe risk of such cancers. (Smokers of anything should also worry \nabout lung cancer.) But it's not clear that THC is carcinogenic. The \nlatest research suggests that THC may have a dual effect, promoting \ntumors by increasing free radicals and simultaneously protecting \nagainst tumors by playing a beneficial role in a process known as \nprogrammed cell death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it addictive?\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who believe you can't become physically or psychologically \ndependent on marijuana are wrong. At least three recent studies have \ndemonstrated that heavy pot smokers who quit can experience such \nwithdrawal symptoms as anxiety, difficulty sleeping and stomach pain. \nOn the other hand, the risk of becoming dependent on marijuana is \ncomparatively low. Just 9% of those who have used the drug develop \ndependence. By comparison, 15% of drinkers become dependent on \nalcohol, 23% of heroin users get hooked, and a third of tobacco \nsmokers become slaves to cigarettes.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it make you stupid?\u0014\n\u0014\nPotheads are dumber than nonusers, but only a little. Earlier this \nyear, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a \nstudy of 102 near-daily marijuana users who wanted to quit. The \nauthors found that the longer subjects had toked up, the worse their \nmemories and attention spans. But they were hardly like Gobi, the \nSaturday Night Live wastoid who is so ruined he can barely talk. \nParticipants who had used cannabis regularly for an average of 10 \nyears fared significantly worse on only two of 40 indices of \ncognitive functioning (they had particular trouble estimating how \nmuch time had passed during a test). Those stout folks who had been \nsmoking pot for an average of 24 years did significantly worse on 14 \nof the tests. But scientists can't say that marijuana causes such \nproblems. \"These long-term users may have been worse off in the first \nplace, before they ever smoked marijuana,\" says Dr. Harrison Pope, a \nHarvard psychiatrist who wrote an editorial accompanying the study \narguing that \"we must live with uncertainty\" on whether pot causes \nlong-term cognitive impairments.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about sex?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe latest studies suggest I needn't have fretted so much about pot's \ngonadal consequences. \"Marijuana might interfere with [kids'] ability \nto go through puberty,\" says Dr. Adrian Dobs, co-author of a paper on \nthe endocrine effects of the drug in the upcoming Journal of Clinical \nPharmacology. \"But the abnormalities seen are not really clinically \nsignificant.\" Despite tales of male potheads growing breasts, the \nlong-term effects on adult glands are uncertain.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo the sick really benefit?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo if marijuana can be harmful to healthy peoplebut usually \nisn'tcould it actually be good for the sick? This is where the \nscience gets scraggierand in the absence of data, politics takes \nover. What we know is that healers have accumulated copious anecdotes \non weed's powers over the past 4,700 years. Understanding Marijuana \nauthor Earleywine credits a (possibly mythical) Chinese emperor with \nintroducing the plant as a treatment for gout around 2700 B.C. But \nthe emperor also thought his pot potion would help memory, making him \nthe first of many fans to aggrandize the drug's medical potential. \nThe ancient Greek doc Galen even used the drug to treat flatulence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe A.M.A. issued a report last year summarizing the body of \nknowledge about medical marijuana. It's shockingly slim. Dr. Abrams \nin San Francisco has produced some of the clearest evidence to date \nof pot's therapeutic value. Even though his clinical trial was \ndesigned merely to investigate whether marijuana is safe for HIV \npatients, he also turned up data that anyone who ever had the \nmunchies already knew: pot makes you hungry. Test subjects who smoked \nmarijuana gained an average of 6.6 lbs. during the trial, compared \nwith 2.4 lbs. for the group taking the placebo. Some other findings \nfrom the A.M.A. report:\u0014\n\u0014\nNAUSEA Patients who are HIV-positive or undergoing chemotherapy can \nhave trouble keeping food down, so anything that helps them eat is \nsignificantthough not necessarily for the reasons marijuana boosters \nthink. Pot's ability to enhance appetite may have more to do with its \nhigh and less to do with any direct effects on nausea. Only 20% to \n25% of patients in two 1980s trials could completely control vomiting \nwith marijuana; other drugs work better for emesis. Still, the A.M.A. \nrecommended more studies on marijuana for those who don't respond to \nthe other drugs, and it notes that for those feeling sick, inhaling a \nsubstance may be more palatable than swallowing a pill.\u0014\n\u0014\nGLAUCOMA Marijuana does reduce pressure on the eyeball, about 25%, \nbut the drug isn't always practical as a glaucoma treatment. Many who \nhave the disease are elderly and can't tolerate pot's tendency to \nraise heart rates.\u0014\n\u0014\nSPASTICITY Marijuana can help people with spasticity (extreme muscle \ntension) and tremor due to multiple sclerosis and trauma. But the \ndrug hasn't been rigorously compared with the standard antispastic \ntreatments.\u0014\n\u0014\nPAIN In patients with postoperative pain, THC is more effective than \na placebo, and some reports suggest smoking pot may reduce the need \nfor highly addictive opioids. But the A.M.A. says better-designed \nstudies are needed to properly evaluate pot as a painkiller. Several \nare under way. In California, five teams of researchers are \nconducting studies of marijuana as an analgesic, particularly for \ncancer and nerve pain.\u0014\nThe A.M.A. concludes that the lack of \"high-quality clinical research \n... continues to hamper development of rational public policy\" on \nmedical marijuana. Which raises the question, Why, after five \nmillenniums, doesn't such research exist? Two possible answers: \nFirst, the government may have rejected cannabis studies to avoid any \nchallenge to its view that pot is dangerous and medically useless. \nSecond, pot may just be dangerous and medically useless.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe drug wasn't always so controversial in the scientific \nestablishment. The U.S. Pharmacopeia, a doctors' listing of remedies \nbegun in 1820, first included cannabis in 1870. The Pharmacopeia \ndidn't drop pot until its 1942 edition, the first published after \ncannabis was outlawed in 1937. Eventually most physicians began to \nview the drug as little more than a crude intoxicant. They tended to \nfavor new-fashioned drugs that were refined by pharmaceutical firms \ninto pure chemicals. Raw marijuana contains some 400 compounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't until the '70s that modern methods were applied to test the \nmedicinal effects of cannabis. As Earleywine recounts, a UCLA study \ndesigned to confirm police reports that pot dilates pupils found \ninstead a slight constriction. That's how doctors discovered the drug \ncould help glaucoma sufferers by reducing intraocular pressure. In \nthe years after that discovery, 26 states opened therapeutic research \nprograms.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Federal Government, which by then controlled the only legal \nsupply of marijuana, had just passed the Controlled Substances Act of \n1970. That law placed marijuana in Schedule I, the designation for \ndrugs without valid medical use. State health officials found it \ndifficult to persuade their federal counterparts to give them \ncannabis for research, as doing so would undermine the law, at least \nin spirit, by suggesting there were medical uses. (Only seven states \ngot pot. One was Tennessee, which is why Al Gore's sister was able to \ntry the drug before losing her battle with lung cancer in 1984.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved \ndronabinol, an oral form of synthetic THC, to treat \nchemotherapy-induced nausea. Many doctors believed dronabinol, \nmarketed as Marinol, could provide the benefits of the plant without \nthe impurities. By the mid-'80s, the availability of Marinol and the \nescalating drug war had killed the state research programs. But \nMarinol turned out to have shortcomings. Because it enters the blood \nthrough the stomach, it doesn't work as fast as smoked marijuana. \nBecause it is essentially pure THC, its users can get too high. \n\"Marinol does tend to knock people out,\" says Abrams, the San \nFrancisco doctor who has conducted trials with both Marinol and pot. \n\"Our patients [taking Marinol] spent a lot of time in bed, and that \nwasn't the case with those smoking marijuana.\" Such problems appeared \nin only \"a small portion of the patients in our clinical trials,\" \nsays Dr. Hjalmar Lagast, a vice president for Solvay Pharmaceuticals, \nwhich makes Marinol. He notes that the drug comes in three strengths, \nallowing doctors to pick the right dose. By the early '90s, at the \nheight of the U.S. AIDS epidemic, many patients so preferred \nmarijuana to Marinol that they would use the street drug regardless \nof legality or safety. Abrams and a few others began pushing the \ngovernment to permit new studies of marijuana to find out what these \npatients were doing to themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials again resisted, and some researchers became convinced the \ngovernment would never allow evidence of pot's possible benefits to \nemerge. In 1999, Paul Consroe, a professor of pharmacology at the \nUniversity of Arizona, failed to win FDA approval for a clinical \ntrial of marijuana for AIDS and cancer wasting. He believes the FDA \nturned him down because of political pressure. \"If you want to study \nits harmful effects, you can get all the money you want,\" says \nConsroe. \"But for this one, I would have spun my wheels forever.\" (An \nFDA spokeswoman declined to comment.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took Abrams five years, but he finally pushed his study through. A \nstubborn and irreverent oncologist who had watched hundreds of AIDS \npatients suffer brutal nausea, he won government approval in 1997 for \nthe first clinical trial of marijuana in more than a decade. \nMarijuana proposals at the time required the approval of three \nagenciesthe FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuseand the DEA and NIDA had resisted. A \nDEA official worried in a letter about the political fallout if \nAbrams found positive results. \"The government is saying there are no \nstudies proving the medical benefits,\" Abrams fumed in 1996. \"But \nthey're also not letting studies be conducted.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNot true, says Steven Gust, special assistant to the director of \nNIDA, who has worked at the agency 15 years. \"Ever since I've been \nhere, there's been no prejudice against studying the medical \napplications of marijuana. Frankly, good proposals weren't coming in. \nThe people you've talked to had a bad experience getting approval, \nand that's going to color their perception.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the case, Abrams and Gust agree that the government and \nmedical-marijuana researchers are now working together. Abrams has \ntwo approved studies under way, and the State of California has \nfounded a new, grander version of its old therapeutic research \nprogram. The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, which opened at \nthe University of California two years ago with a yearly budget of $3 \nmillion, currently supports 11 studies that have received federal \napproval.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, many scientistsespecially in the governmentstill squirm \nat the very idea of medical-marijuana research. Despite encouraging \nanecdotal reports, the National Institute of Health hasn't initiated \na study of cannabis therapeutics in two decades, leaving California's \nyoung center as the only U.S. research institution doing the basic \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarijuana remains the only drug that researchers must acquire \ndirectly from the feds. If the FDA and DEA approve, scientists can \nget even ecstasy from outside labs, but NIDA is the sole source for \ncannabis, requiring a third bureaucratic layer. \"In an era of \nprivatization, it's shocking that the government insists on a \nmonopoly so that it can choose not to provide marijuana to projects \nit doesn't like,\" says Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary \nAssociation for Psychedelic Studies, a nonprofit pharmaceutical firm. \n(For 18 months, Doblin's association and the University of \nMassachusetts Amherst have unsuccessfully sought a license to grow \nresearch-grade cannabis at the university.)\u0014\n\u0014\nNot every country is as pot-phobic as the U.S. Scientists in Britain, \nwhich has effectively decriminalized personal use of small amounts of \npot, have moved well beyond the preliminary work being done in the \nU.S. Britain's GW Pharmaceuticals plans to publish results of a large \nstudy of its new marijuana product, a whole-cannabis extract rendered \ninto a mouth spray. That way, patients avoid the lung damage of \nsmoking. The British government is likely to make the spray available \nfor prescription if published results are as good as the company \npromises.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this country, new drug products like GW's spray rarely appear \nwithout cordial cooperation among pharmaceutical companies, research \ninstitutions and government officials. Such partnership could take \nyears to develop. But the politics has leaped well ahead of the \nscience, meaning voters will decide long before physicians whether \nmedical marijuana is an oxymoron.\u0014",

They won our hearts and minds with \nnew theology and\u0014\n                     new terms like \"inerrant\". The greatest \nimplication of \"inerrant\" is that\u0014\n                     it proves the existence of God. If you have an \ninerrant/perfect Bible,\u0014\n                     (only God is perfect) then God produced the \nBible and therefore He\u0014\n                     exists.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Inerrancy continues to be an issue in the SBC as \nwell as the state\u0014\n                     conventions. In the SBC it is one of the \nrequirements for a person to\u0014\n                     be appointed to a board of trustees or to other \nplaces of service. In\u0014\n                     recent years several Baptist state conventions \nhave faced motions\u0014\n                     and resolutions concerning the question, \"Is the \nBible\u0014\n                     inerrant/perfect?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Inerrancy was a major consideration in the \ntake-over of the SBC.\u0014\n                     Even to this last SBC (96) the committee that \nbrings trustee\u0014\n                     nominations to the floor of the convention, \ncertified that each one\u0014\n                     subscribed to inerrancy. They continue to \"fire \nand hire\" on the basis\u0014\n                     of inerrancy. However, most Baptist state \nconventions have been\u0014\n                     slow to adopt or enforce \"inerrancy\" as an \nofficial position.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     A few years ago the inerrantists were saying \nthat the Bible which we\u0014\n                     hold in our hand was inerrant. However, Baptists \ntoday have become\u0014\n                     informed and know that the Greek New Testament \nhas many\u0014\n                     variables. Those supporting inerrancy have \nretreated to THE\u0014\n                     THEORY that only the original copies \n(autographs) were inerrant.\u0014\n                     Therefore the current question is, Were the \noriginal copies inerrant?\u0014\n                     Since none of the original manuscripts exist, \nhow can we determine\u0014\n                     whether or not the originals were inerrant? \nTherefore, the most\u0014\n                     relevant question is, WHAT DID THE EARLY CHURCH \nBELIEVE\u0014\n                     ABOUT THE BIBLE? \u0014\n\u0014\n                     TWO CONCERNS: \u0014\n\u0014\n                     FIRST CONCERN: If generations passed before the \nNew Testament\u0014\n                     was accepted, it is logical to assume that the \nearly church DID NOT\u0014\n                     look upon the original manuscripts as \ninerrant/perfect. What is the\u0014\n                     evidence?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The historical facts of the first few hundred \nyears reveal what the\u0014\n                     early church believed. THIS IS THE EVIDENCE: The \nfour gospels\u0014\n                     were used authoritatively (accepted) by about \n150 A.D. and about 10\u0014\n                     of Paul's Epistles by 175 A.D. By the year 200, \nabout 22 of the books\u0014\n                     that we now accept and some that we don't accept \nwere also being\u0014\n                     used. The last five books (2 Peter, 2 and 3 \nJohn, Jude, and\u0014\n                     Revelation) were not accepted until later. For \ninstance, Revelation\u0014\n                     was accepted by the Western church in about 400 \nA.D. The Eastern\u0014\n                     Church accepted it in 692 while the Church at \nAntioch (Syrian) did\u0014\n                     not accept it until the Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Since the selection process took several hundred \nyears it is obvious\u0014\n                     that the early church DID NOT look upon the \noriginals as inerrant or\u0014\n                     perfect.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     SECOND CONCERN:: Did the scribes, copyists and \ntheologians treat\u0014\n                     the original manuscripts as inerrant/perfect?. \nLuke showed that he\u0014\n                     didn't believe the writers wrote inerrantly in \nLuke 1:1-3: ...several\u0014\n                     biographies of Christ have already been written \nusing as their source\u0014\n                     material the reports circulating among us from \nthe early disciples and\u0014\n                     other eyewitnesses. However it occurred to me \nthat it would be well to\u0014\n                     recheck all these accounts...and after thorough \ninvestigation...to\u0014\n                     reassure you of the truth... .\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Luke did not hint that the writers or himself \ndepended on God for\u0014\n                     Divine knowledge to reveal to them the facts, \nbut they had reports for\u0014\n                     their source material and he used footwork to \ncheck their writings.\u0014\n                     The following is an example of Luke correcting \nhis own copy while\u0014\n                     using Mark as his source. Mark quotes Isaiah in \nMark 1:2,3 but verse\u0014\n                     2 is actually from Malachi. Both Luke 3:4 and \nMatthew 3:3 corrected\u0014\n                     this oversight by simply omitting Malachi's \nprophecy from their text. It\u0014\n                     is interesting to note that the editors of the \nKJV \"corrected\" Mark's\u0014\n                     oversight by changing \"Isaiah\" to \"prophets\" in \nMark 1:2.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Most of the textual variations are insignificant \nand there are no major\u0014\n                     doctrines in doubt. However it is still true \nthat nearly every sentence\u0014\n                     in the New Testament does have a variation in \none or more of the\u0014\n                     other 4,000 manuscripts. The editors, Barbara \nand Kurt Aland, of the\u0014\n                     Nestlets text of The Greek New Testament, \ninclude 1,438 of the more\u0014\n                     significant variants. In the Greek text they \nhave devised a system to\u0014\n                     select the best variant. Additionally they use \nsingle and double\u0014\n                     brackets to denote the degree of probability as \nto whether or not\u0014\n                     some of the more questionable variants were in \nthe original text.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     HOW DID THESE VARIANTS GET INTO THE MANUSCRIPTS?\u0014\n                     Westcott and Hortin in The New Testament in the \nOriginal Greek\u0014\n                     write that there was an: ...early mixture of \n[the] independent lines of\u0014\n                     transmission...\"(p. 565). \"Words and even \nclauses are changed,\u0014\n                     omitted, and inserted with surprising freedom... \n.\"(p. 550) \"More\u0014\n                     peculiar to the Western text is the readiness to \nadopt alterations or\u0014\n                     additions from sources extraneous to the books \nwhich ultimately\u0014\n                     became canonical. (p.550)\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The early churchmen had original and near \noriginal manuscripts and\u0014\n                     yet they altered the texts for any number of \nreasons. We have no\u0014\n                     record that the early church tried to preserve \nthe original wording nor\u0014\n                     did any of the Apostolic or church Fathers \nlament the fact that the\u0014\n                     originals were not preserved in their original \nstate. Since the early\u0014\n                     churchmen changed, altered and accepted \nadditions from outside\u0014\n                     sources, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE EARLY CHURCH DID \nNOT\u0014\n                     BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS TO BE\u0014\n                     INERRANT\\PERFECT.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     If we must pose a question about the Bible, let \nit be, \"Is the text\u0014\n                     trustworthy? Again let us accept the conclusion \nof Westcott and\u0014\n                     Hortin, \"If comparative trivialities, such as \nchanges of order, the\u0014\n                     insertion or omission of the article with proper \nnames, and the like,\u0014\n                     are set aside, the words in our opinion still \nsubject to doubt can\u0014\n                     hardly amount to more than a thousandth part of \nthe whole New\u0014\n                     Testament.\"(p.565) In the previous quotation \nWestcott and Hortin\u0014\n                     have reassured us that they have reconstructed a \nreliable text from\u0014\n                     the more than 4000 manuscripts and 20,000 \nquotations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     We desperately need to believe the historical \nevidence of the early\u0014\n                     church. Believing as they did, they spread the \nGospel to the whole\u0014\n                     world in a few hundred years. If we Baptists \nwill accept the historical\u0014\n                     facts as lived by the early church, we can get \non with the \"weightier\u0014\n                     matters\"--missions and evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Let us pray that the SBC cease the practice of \nfiring and hiring on\u0014\n                     the basis of inerrancy. Let us pray that we will \nbe so well informed on\u0014\n                     the subject that it will not come up. But if it \nshould, let us pray that we\u0014\n                     will be loving enough to accept one another and \nthat we will not make\u0014\n                     it a test of fellowship or a test of employment. \nWe need to reinstate\u0014\n                     the practice of \"agreeing to disagree.\".\u0014\n\u0014\n                     THE BIBLE IS PERFECT ENOUGH that when it is \npreached, the Holy\u0014\n                     Spirit bears witness to those who hear that they \nshould become\u0014\n                     disciples of Jesus.

    "words": "\"In All Things Be Thankful\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBack during the dark days of 1929, a group of ministers in the \nNortheast,\u0014\nall graduates of the Boston School of Theology, gathered to discuss \nhow they\u0014\nshould conduct their Thanksgiving Sunday services. Things were about \nas bad\u0014\nas they could get, with no sign of relief. The bread lines were \ndepressingly\u0014\nlong, the stock market had plummeted, and the term Great Depression \nseemed\u0014\nan apt description for the mood of the country. The ministers thought \nthey\u0014\nshould only lightly touch upon the subject Thanksgiving in deference \nto the\u0014\nhuman misery all about them. After all, there was to be thankful for. \nBut it\u0014\nwas Dr. William L. Stiger, pastor of a large congregation in the city \nthat\u0014\nrallied the group. This was not the time, he suggested, to give mere \npassing\u0014\nmention to Thanksgiving, just the opposite. This was the time for the \nnation\u0014\nto get matters in perspective and thank God for blessings always \npresent,\u0014\nbut perhaps suppressed due to intense hardship.\u0014\n\u0014\nI suggest to you the ministers struck upon something. The most intense\u0014\nmoments of thankfulness are not found in times of plenty, but when\u0014\ndifficulties abound. Think of the Pilgrims that first Thanksgiving. \nHalf\u0014\ntheir number dead, men without a country, but still there was \nthanksgiving\u0014\nto God. Their gratitude was not for something but in something. It \nwas that\u0014\nsame sense of gratitude that lead Abraham Lincoln to formally \nestablish the\u0014\nfirst Thanksgiving Day in the midst of national civil war, when the \nbutcher's\u0014\nlist of casualties seemed to have no end and the very nation \nstruggled for\u0014\nsurvival.\u0014",

Beverley | posted 12/28/2001\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden, the world's most notorious \nterrorist, has handed\u0014\n                      Muslims everywhere their worst public-relations \nnightmare: September 11\u0014\n                      as a picture, an embodiment, of Islam. Muslims \nnow have to define\u0014\n                      themselves in relation to the day of infamy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Abdulaziz Sachedina, a Muslim scholar at the \nUniversity of Virginia, says\u0014\n                      he does not remember ever praying so earnestly \nthat God would spare\u0014\n                      Muslims the blame for \"such madness that was \nunleashed upon New York\u0014\n                      and Washington.I felt the pain and, perhaps \nfor the first time in my entire\u0014\n                      life, I felt embarrassed at the thought that it \ncould very well be my fellow\u0014\n                      Muslims who had committed this horrendous act \nof terrorism. How could\u0014\n                      these terrorists invoke God's mercifulness and \ncompassion when they\u0014\n                      had, through their evil act, put to shame the \nentire history of this great\u0014\n                      religion and its culture of toleration?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Every judgment about Islam, all reaction to \nMuslim doctrine, and each\u0014\n                      Muslim-Christian encounter are now cast in \nlight of the events of that\u0014\n                      dreadful day.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Islam as a Path of Peace\u0014\n                      There are three distinct interpretations of the \nevents of September 11. The\u0014\n                      first view is that the terrorist acts do not \nrepresent Islam. President George\u0014\n                      W. Bush best expressed this notion when he said \nthat \"Islam is a religion\u0014\n                      of peace.\" One of the leading Muslims to echo \nthis is Yusuf Islam (the\u0014\n                      former rock musician Cat Stevens, who now helps \npromote Muslim\u0014\n                      education in England). \"Today, I am aghast at \nthe horror of recent events\u0014\n                      and feel it a duty to speak out,\" he said in a \nLondon newspaper. \"Not only\u0014\n                      did terrorists hijack planes and destroy life; \nthey also hijacked the\u0014\n                      beautiful religion of Islam.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During an interfaith ceremony at Yankee Stadium \non September 23, Imam\u0014\n                      Izak-El M.

They are no believers in God at all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Major Muslim organizations throughout North \nAmerica, including the\u0014\n                      Council on American-Islamic Relations, the \nIslamic Society of North\u0014\n                      America, and the Muslim Students Association, \ndenounced the work of\u0014\n                      the terrorists. The powerful American Muslim \nCouncil issued a press\u0014\n                      release on September 11, saying it \"strongly \ncondemns this morning's\u0014\n                      plane attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon and expresses\u0014\n                      deep sorrow for Americans that were injured and \nkilled. amc sends out its\u0014\n                      condolences to all the families of the victims \nof this cowardly terrorist\u0014\n                      attack.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With the exception of Iraq, Muslim nations \ndistanced themselves from the\u0014\n                      attack on America. \"Iran has vehemently \ncondemned the suicidal terrorist\u0014\n                      attacks in the United States,\" Iran Today \nreported in a front-page story on\u0014\n                      September 24, \"and has expressed its deep \nsorrow and sympathy with\u0014\n                      the American nation.\" The governments of \nBahrain, Egypt, Lebanon,\u0014\n                      Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, \nTurkey, United Arab\u0014\n                      Emirates, and Yemen expressed similar \nsentiments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Leading intellectuals, who have argued that \nterrorist acts represent only\u0014\n                      fringe Muslims, have also promoted the view \nthat Islam is a religion of\u0014\n                      peace. Edward Said, the controversial Columbia \nUniversity professor,\u0014\n                      argued in The Nation that September 11 is an \nact of cultic religion.\u0014\n                      Comparing Islamists to the Branch Davidians and \nthe Rev.

Thomas \nFriedman, author of From Beirut to\u0014\n                      Jerusalem, has taunted Osama bin Laden in his \nNew York Times\u0014\n                      columns, while also warning of the terrorist's \npopularity in Saudi Arabia,\u0014\n                      Pakistan, and other Muslim nations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      British journalist Julie Burchill wrote a \nscathing article in The Guardian\u0014\n                      against the \"sustained effort on the part of \nthe British media to present\u0014\n                      Islameven after the Rushdie affair and now \nduring the Taliban's reign of\u0014\n                      terroras something essentially 'joyous' and \n'vibrant,' sort of like\u0014\n                      Afro-Caribbean culture, only with fasting and \nfatwas.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Melanie Phillips, writing in The Times of \nLondon, raises the possibility of\u0014\n                      treason among British Muslims. \"As if the \nprogress of the Afghan war\u0014\n                      wasn't enough to worry about, a nightmare \nspecter is emerging at home.\u0014\n                      The attitude of many British Muslims should \ncause the greatest possible\u0014\n                      alarm that we have a fifth column in our \nmidst.Thousands of alienated\u0014\n                      young Muslims, most of them born and bred here \nbut who regard\u0014\n                      themselves as an army within, are waiting for \nan opportunity to help to\u0014\n                      destroy the society that sustains them.

Rick Bragg reported in\u0014\n                      The New York Times about Muslim boys running \nthrough their school\u0014\n                      compounds in Pakistan on September 11. They \nwere \"celebrating,\u0014\n                      stabbing the fingers on one hand into the palm \nof the other, to simulate a\u0014\n                      plane stabbing into a building.\" Palestinian \nauthorities went into overdrive\u0014\n                      to suppress images of youths celebrating the \ndeaths in America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      September 11 as Islam\u0014\n                      There is, finally, the view that September 11 \nrepresents authentic Islam, a\u0014\n                      notion adopted by Osama bin Laden and his many \nfollowers. His\u0014\n                      revolutionary zeal lacks no clarity. \"The \nruling to kill the Americans and\u0014\n                      their alliescivilians and militaryis an \nindividual duty for every Muslim\u0014\n                      who can do it in any country in which it is \npossible to do it,\" he said in\u0014\n                      February 1998.

Of these, \nthe most influential is\u0014\n                      Robert A. Morey, the popular evangelical \ncult-watcher, who in recent years\u0014\n                      has targeted Islam as a deadly religion. Author \nof The Islamic Invasion,\u0014\n                      Morey has often debated leading Muslim \napologists, in fiery exchanges\u0014\n                      that have led to mob attacks on him and \nrepeated calls for his death.\u0014\n                      Morey has accused Muhammad of being a racist, a \nmurderer, an irrational\u0014\n                      zealot, and a pedophile. After September 11, \nMorey announced a spiritual\u0014\n                      crusade against Islam, and invited Christians \nto sign this pledge:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           In response to the Muslim Holy War now \nbeing waged\u0014\n                           against us, We, the undersigned, following \nthe example of\u0014\n                           the Christian Church since the 7th \ncentury, do commit\u0014\n                           ourselves, our wealth, and our families to \njoin in a Holy\u0014\n                           Crusade to fight against Islam and its \nfalse god, false\u0014\n                           prophet, and false book. We, the \nundersigned, believe that\u0014\n                           Islam is the root of all Muslim terrorism, \nwhich is the fruit of\u0014\n                           Islam. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christian scholars have criticized Morey for \nhis invective, but he remains\u0014\n                      unmoved. He has argued that Muslims will start \nWorld War III. On his Web\u0014\n                      site, Morey invites Christians to fill in a \n\"certificate of valor\" that reads, \"I\u0014\n                      wish to join in the Crusade of Christ against \nIslam. To that end, and to\u0014\n                      demonstrate in the crusade against Islam, I \nhereby donate toward\u0014\n                      emergency wartime funds.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Rise of the Militants\u0014\n                      Sorting through these three interpretations \ndemands analysis of some\u0014\n                      deeper issues. First, we must come to grips \nwith the vast unrest in the\u0014\n                      Islamic world, both now and over the last two \ncenturies. There has been a\u0014\n                      growing radicalization in Islam since the early \n1800s, both in response to\u0014\n                      the spread of Western colonialism and the \ndemise of Muslim political\u0014\n                      supremacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden traces his radicalism to the \nWahhabism of his native\u0014\n                      Saudi Arabia, a movement that began with the \nreformer Muhammad ibn\u0014\n                      'Abd al-Wahhab (170387), an advocate of a \npuritanical reading of Islamic\u0014\n                      law and belief. The Wahhabis threatened the \ninterests of the Ottoman\u0014\n                      Turks and, in concert with the Saud dynasty, \neventually gained control of\u0014\n                      Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest cities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A fundamentalist thrust in Islam emerged in \nEgypt as well, with the\u0014\n                      formation of the Muslim Brotherhood (also known \nas Al-Ikhwan\u0014\n                      al-Muslimun) in 1927. Tormented first by the \npresence of British rule and\u0014\n                      then by a tepid Muslim government, brotherhood \nfounder Hassan al-Banna\u0014\n                      and Sayyid Qutb, his chief intellectual heir, \nsought by any means,\u0014\n                      including violence, to restore true Islamic \nrule to Egypt.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The brotherhood started branches in Jordan and \nSyria, and militant groups\u0014\n                      in India, Iran, and Iraq imitated its \nradicalism. Muhammad Nawab-Safavi\u0014\n                      started his Fedayeen-e-Islami movement in Iran \nin the 1930s and told his\u0014\n                      followers: \"Throw away your beads and get a \ngun: for beads keep you\u0014\n                      silent whilst guns silence the enemies of \nIslam.\" Abul A'la Maududi\u0014\n                      organized his militant Jamaat-e-Islami in the \nPunjab in 1941. After the\u0014\n                      creation of Pakistan in 1947, Maududi tried \nrepeatedly to convince the\u0014\n                      government to adopt his stricter version of \nIslamic rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Western awareness of militant Islam came with \nthe radical overthrow of\u0014\n                      the Shah of Iran in 1979 and the establishment \nof harsh Shari'ah law under\u0014\n                      the Ayatollah Khomeini. American exposure to \nIslamic fundamentalism\u0014\n                      came with the arrest of Americans in Tehran, \nthe bombing of the World\u0014\n                      Trade Center in 1993, the explosions at U.S. \nembassies in Africa, the\u0014\n                      attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, and then the \nhorrors of September 11.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Interpreting Jihad\u0014\n                      Every discussion of Islamic militancy turns \neventually to two fundamental\u0014\n                      concerns. First, how much is Islamism (that \npracticed by fundamentalist\u0014\n                      Muslims open to violence) rooted in the \nteaching and practice of the\u0014\n                      prophet Muhammad? Would he celebrate the work \nof Osama bin Laden?\u0014\n                      Second, are the violent jihads of our day \nsanctioned by the Qur'an and by\u0014\n                      the actions of early Muslim leaders?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The prophet himself engaged in many military \nbattles and could be\u0014\n                      merciless to his enemies, even those who simply \nattacked him verbally.\u0014\n                      His original sympathies with Jews and \nChristians as \"Peoples of the\u0014\n                      Book\" gave way to a harsher treatment when they \ndid not follow Islam. In\u0014\n                      one infamous episode, Muhammad cut the heads \noff hundreds of Jewish\u0014\n                      males of the Beni Quraiza tribe who did not \nside with him in battle. The\u0014\n                      prophet is quoted as saying, \"The sword is the \nkey of heaven and hell; a\u0014\n                      drop of blood shed in the cause of Allah, a \nnight spent in arms, is of more\u0014\n                      avail than two months of fasting or prayer: \nwhosoever falls in battle, his\u0014\n                      sins are forgiven, and at the day of judgment \nhis limbs shall be supplied by\u0014\n                      the wings of angels and cherubim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In reference to the Qur'an, many have drawn \nattention to the famous\u0014\n                      passage in Surah 2:256: \"Let there be no \ncompulsion in religion.\" This\u0014\n                      verse fits well with other Qur'an verses in \nwhich jihad means personal and\u0014\n                      communal spiritual struggle or striving. But \nthe Qur'an also uses jihad to\u0014\n                      mean \"holy war,\" and the language can be \nextreme. Surah 5:33 reads,\u0014\n                      \"The punishment of those who wage war against \nGod and His Messenger,\u0014\n                      and strive with might and main for mischief \nthrough the land is: execution,\u0014\n                      or crucifixion, or cutting off of hands and \nfeet from opposite sides, or exile\u0014\n                      from the land: that is their disgrace in this \nworld, and a heavy punishment\u0014\n                      is theirs in the Hereafter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both the example of the prophet and some \nemphases in the Qur'an\u0014\n                      provided warrant for Islam's earliest leaders \nto spread Islam by military\u0014\n                      conquest. Bloody expansionism was also \njustified through original Islamic\u0014\n                      law that divided the world into two realms: Dar \nal-Harb (the land of war)\u0014\n                      and Dar al-Islam (land under Islamic rule). \nBoth Paul Fregosi's Jihad in the\u0014\n                      West and Jewish scholar Bat Ye'or's Decline of \nEastern Christianity Under\u0014\n                      Islam document the reality of Muslim crusades \nlong before the notorious\u0014\n                      Christian crusades of the Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Out of the vortex of these realities emerge two \ndifferent perspectives\u0014\n                      among modern Muslims. Islamists consider their \nactions a true jihad or\u0014\n                      \"holy war\" against infidels and the enemies of \nIslam. They believe it is right\u0014\n                      to target America, \"the great Satan.\" Osama bin \nLaden believes that the\u0014\n                      Qur'an supports his campaign, that the prophet \nwould bless his cause,\u0014\n                      and that Allah is on his side. But the vast \nmajority of Muslims believe that\u0014\n                      nothing in Muhammad's life or in the Qur'an or \nIslamic law justifies\u0014\n                      terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bernard Lewis, the great historian of Islam, \nnoted in The Wall Street\u0014\n                      Journal that throughout history, Muslims have \ngiven jihad both spiritual and\u0014\n                      military meaning. Lewis also pays particular \nattention to the legal\u0014\n                      traditions in Islam about what constitutes just \nwar. After noting the many\u0014\n                      limitations placed on military jihad, he \nwrites, \"What the classical jurists of\u0014\n                      Islam never remotely considered is the kind of \nunprovoked, unannounced\u0014\n                      mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations \nthat we saw in New York.\u0014\n                      For this there is no precedent and no authority \nin Islam.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The Clash of Civilizations,\" Samuel \nHuntington's essay for Foreign Affairs\u0014\n                      (Summer 1993), has attracted considerable \nattention in recent months.\u0014\n                      Writing just after the Gulf War, Huntington \nanalyzed the competing\u0014\n                      ideologies of our time and drew particular \nattention to the clash between\u0014\n                      Islam and the West. His concern has obvious \nmerit, although critics have\u0014\n                      made a crucial point that Islam is no monolith. \nThere are clashes within\u0014\n                      Islamic civilization itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What may emerge as the most significant factor \nin the current shape of\u0014\n                      our world, then, is not the clash between Islam \nand the West. It is,\u0014\n                      instead, the clash between Muslims as they try \nto define their faith for the\u0014\n                      21st century. Islam clearly does not speak with \none voice. It shows nearly\u0014\n                      as much diversity as does Christianity (see \"A \nMany Splintered Thing\").\u0014\n                      The debate within Islam will be protracted, \nregardless of how long military\u0014\n                      campaigns continue against any Islamist \nmovement.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Troubles in Palestine\u0014\n                      The Palestinian question has also fueled the \ngrowth of Islamic militancy.\u0014\n                      Tensions in Palestine between Muslims and Jews \ndate back to the first\u0014\n                      wave of Jewish \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nin the late 1800s.

Islamic militant\u0014\n                      groups like Hamas and Hizbollah call for an \narmed jihad against Israel.\u0014\n                      Many Palestinian Muslims celebrate the attack \non America but also claim\u0014\n                      it was really the work of the CIA and Israel's \nMossad.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the mix of all this turmoil is the seemingly \nendless cycle of violence in\u0014\n                      Israel and Palestine. Here are just five \nexamples of terrorist acts against\u0014\n                      Israelis in the year before September 11:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      August 12A suicide bombing at a caf in Kiryat \nMotzkin wounded 21.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      August 9A bombing at a pizza place in \nJerusalem killed 15, including 6\u0014\n                      children, and injured 80.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      June 1A Palestinian suicide bomber associated \nwith Hamas detonated\u0014\n                      an explosive belt that injured 120 and killed \n20 at a nightclub in Tel Aviv.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      May 9Two 14-year-old Jewish boys were stoned \nto death at a cave near\u0014\n                      their small town of Tekoa, in the West Bank.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      February 14A Palestinian bus driver plowed \ninto a crowd near Tel-Aviv,\u0014\n                      killing 8.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the other hand, writers as diverse as Noam \nChomsky, Hans Kng,\u0014\n                      Michael Lerner, Edward Said, and David Grossman \n(author of The Yellow\u0014\n                      Wind) argue for recognizing injustices done \nagainst Palestinians by Israel.\u0014\n                      They also argue for stronger American \ncomplaints against Israeli\u0014\n                      settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. In the \nlast 15 years, the case for\u0014\n                      a Palestinian state has grown more popular \namong moderate Jews and\u0014\n                      many analysts sympathetic to Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"With or without Islamic fundamentalism, with \nor without Arab terrorism,\u0014\n                      there is no justification whatsoever for the \nlasting occupation and\u0014\n                      suppression of the Palestinian people by \nIsrael,\" Amos Oz wrote in a New\u0014\n                      York Times editorial. \"We have no right to deny \nPalestinians their natural\u0014\n                      right to self-determination.Two huge oceans \ncould not shelter America\u0014\n                      from terrorism; the occupation of the West Bank \nand Gaza by Israel has\u0014\n                      not made Israel secureon the contrary, it \nmakes our self-defense much\u0014\n                      harder and more complicated.

Is Islam\u0014\n                      fundamentally opposed to human rights by its \ninherently theocratic thrust?\u0014\n                      Why do Muslim countries have such deplorable \nrecords on human rights?\u0014\n                      Data made available by Freedom House, an \norganization that monitors\u0014\n                      political and civil rights in every country of \nthe world, supports this\u0014\n                      assertion. Of the 41 countries whose population \nis at least 70 percent\u0014\n                      Muslim, 26 are considered not free, and 13 are \npartly free.

Why is it that the government of Saudi \nArabia welcomed Allied\u0014\n                      Forces to free Kuwait but forbids entry of \nnon-Muslims to its country?\u0014\n                      Western governments allow Muslims to talk \nfreely about their faith. Why\u0014\n                      can't Christians do the same in many Muslim \ncountries? Muslims rightfully\u0014\n                      express concern about the denial of liberties \nto Palestinians. But are the\u0014\n                      rights of Jews protected in Indonesia? Are \nHindus free in Pakistan?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Human beings are being traded as slaves in \nSudan, a fact documented in\u0014\n                      Paul Marshall's Their Blood Cries Out. Has the \ngovernment in Khartoum\u0014\n                      been flooded with protests from every corner of \nthe Muslim world?\u0014\n                      Likewise, no one can deny the lack of women's \nrights under Islam,\u0014\n                      regardless of Muslim apologists' passion to the \ncontrary. The widespread\u0014\n                      practice of female genital mutilation in Muslim \ncountries alone signals the\u0014\n                      reality of women's oppression.

It would be \nwonderful to know that the Muslim\u0014\n                      leaders who joined President Bush in public to \nexpress solidarity against\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden were already on record as \ncondemning the persecution\u0014\n                      of these Christians in Afghanistan. If not, why \nnot?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1999 I had lunch with an American whose \nidentity I must conceal lest I\u0014\n                      place his life in renewed danger. Over our \nmeal, he told me of a simple but\u0014\n                      life-altering fact. A few years earlier, he \nrealized that he no longer believed\u0014\n                      in Islam, and he abandoned his faith. As a \nresult, he received death\u0014\n                      threatsnot in Sudan, or Libya, or Iraq, but in \nthe United States. Are\u0014\n                      American Muslim leaders disturbed that members \nof their communities\u0014\n                      threaten former Muslims with death? Do American \nMuslims long for\u0014\n                      adoption of Shari'ah law, which would mandate \nthat Muslims who abandon\u0014\n                      their faith be put to death?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rethinking Islam\u0014\n                      Though many Muslims have tried to blame America \nand Israel for all the\u0014\n                      ills of the Muslim world, a rising number of \nMuslim intellectuals are calling\u0014\n                      for a new and radical self-criticism within \nIslam. This point has been\u0014\n                      articulated best by Kanan Makiya, author of \nRepublic of Fear (on Saddam\u0014\n                      Hussein's Iraq) and Cruelty and Silence (a \npowerful protest against the\u0014\n                      timidity of Arab intellectuals to address the \ndark side of the militant\u0014\n                      Islamic Middle East).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Makiya writes in a London Observer article, \n\"Fighting Islam's Ku Klux\u0014\n                      Klan\":\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Arabs and Muslims need today to face up to \nthe fact that\u0014\n                           their resentment at America has long since \nbecome\u0014\n                           unmoored from any rational underpinnings \nit might once have\u0014\n                           had; like the anti-Semitism of the \ninterwar years, it is today\u0014\n                           steeped in deeply embedded conspiratorial \npatterns of\u0014\n                           thought rooted in profound ignorance of \nhow a society and a\u0014\n                           polity like the United States, much less \nIsrael, functions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His article ends with these words:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Muslims and Arabs have to be on the front \nlines of a new\u0014\n                           kind of war, one that is worth waging for \ntheir own salvation\u0014\n                           and in their own souls. And that, as good \nout-of-fashion\u0014\n                           Muslim scholars will tell you, is the true \nmeaning of jihad, a\u0014\n                           meaning that has been hijacked by \nterrorists and suicide\u0014\n                           bombers and all those who applaud or find \nexcuses for\u0014\n                           them. To exorcise what they have done in \nour name is the\u0014\n                           civilizational challenge of the \ntwenty-first century for every\u0014\n                           Arab and Muslim in the world today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The events of September 11 have led some \nnon-Muslims to reconsider\u0014\n                      their rhetoric against the United States and \nIsrael. Of most significance,\u0014\n                      here is the Australian activist, Helen \nDarville, author of The Hand that\u0014\n                      Signed the Paper. She writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           I have watched, since that day, the cozy \nleftist pieties of my\u0014\n                           youth disintegrate. Those pieties will be \nfamiliar to many of\u0014\n                           you. Chief among them is the old saw that \nto understand\u0014\n                           horrors, one must be willing to \ncontextualize them. And if\u0014\n                           that mitigates them, so be it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           The images of Palestinians cheering as \nplanes carved into\u0014\n                           skyscrapers made me sick at heart.

There are accounts beyond number \nof Eastern\u0014\n                           European peasants cheering German \nexecutioners on,\u0014\n                           trying to pry the carbines from their \nhands: let me shoot\u0014\n                           them, Herr Soldat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A lot of these peasants were raised in the \nchurch.

    "title": "I'M DREAMING OF  A VICTORIAN CHRISTMAS",
    "words": "I'm Dreaming of a Victorian Christmas\u0014\nAn ageless story reminds us of the values the Victorians can\u0014\nstill teach us.\u0014\nby Chris Armstrong\u0014\n\u0014\n   A particular Christmas, or to be more exact, two Christmases,\u0014\n   entered the modern imagination in 1868 through a much-beloved\u0014\n   storybook, coloring our vision of Christmas ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The first of these Christmases takes place under the shadow of\u0014\n   war--the Civil War. A few days before the holiday, the four\u0014\n   young daughters of an absent army chaplain mope together in\u0014\n   the home that now seems so empty. They ruefully consider their\u0014\n   holiday prospects: their \"straightened circumstances\" have\u0014\n   reduced the customary Christmas bounty to a mere dollar\u0014\n   apiece, doled out by their mother.\u0014\n\u0014\n   At first, each broods over her meager treasures, planning\u0014\n   self-indulgent purchases. But in the end, they spend the money\u0014\n   on gifts for their mother.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Each girl has evident talents but also evident weaknesses. The\u0014\n   oldest is a motherly sort, perhaps grown up too soon, who\u0014\n   works as a governess. Next is the tomboy, an aspiring author\u0014\n   (transparently, the book's author) and the family instigator,\u0014\n   always writing and staging melodramas into which she drafts\u0014\n   the others. Then the gentle third child, a peacemaker and a\u0014\n   blessing to everyone, but dangerously frail. And last, a\u0014\n   curly-haired, self-conscious beauty who wants to be an artist.\u0014\n\u0014\n   On Christmas morning, each finds a small New Testament with a\u0014\n   colored cover under her pillow, placed there by motherly\u0014\n   hands. And each becomes painfully aware of the petty,\u0014\n   besetting sins that separate her from God and others. Together\u0014\n   they rededicate themselves to following in the footsteps laid\u0014\n   out in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, a story they have acted\u0014\n   out together as girls--up, down, in, under, and through the\u0014\n   landscape of the family home.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Downstairs, they join their mother in pulling together as much\u0014\n   of a Christmas breakfast as they can manage and placing it in\u0014\n   a basket. This they bring to a poor immigrant family with a\u0014\n   sick baby. Their selfless act is rewarded when they return\u0014\n   home to the gift of a rich neighbor--a lavish Christmas\u0014\n   feast with sweets, and flowers to brighten their table.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The book's second Christmas takes place the following year.\u0014\n   The family has weathered the near-death of their sweet third\u0014\n   sister of scarlet fever and the news from the front of their\u0014\n   father's temporary, critical illness. As they gather for the\u0014\n   holiday, they receive a joyous surprise--their father\u0014\n   returns, well and happy. Together again, they trade gifts and\u0014\n   endearments, reveling in each other's company.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Christmases of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women still\u0014\n   shine forth a bright, good hopefulness in the midst of trying\u0014\n   times--a hopefulness made solid in the bond of family and\u0014\n   the desire to live well in God's sight. What allows Alcott's\u0014\n   story to escape the saccharine orbit of many sentimentalist\u0014\n   tales and speak to us in deep ways?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Yes, the author's sure narrative touch and vivid\u0014\n   characterization. But also this, I think: Alcott knows\u0014\n   intimately and presents lovingly truths that were the\u0014\n   Victorian era's special treasure.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The foremost of these is the truth we still recall every\u0014\n   Christmas season: every family, whatever its trials and\u0014\n   stresses, is a God-given blessing to be treasured and\u0014\n   celebrated. Each of us is meant to grow and flourish within a\u0014\n   family, becoming all God means us to be. Without family, the\u0014\n   way is--not impossible, but harder and colder.\u0014\n\u0014\n   It has become difficult even to write this today, so\u0014\n   thoroughly ridiculous has Victorian culture been made to seem\u0014\n   in the jaded, secularized world of modern America. The word\u0014\n   \"Victorian\" has taken on the quality of a curse-word, as\u0014\n   \"Puritan\" did in the original permissive generation, the wide-\u0014\n   open decade of the 1920s, through the acid pen of such\u0014\n   modernizing critics as journalist H. L. Mencken.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Certainly, the critics have their ammunition. The Victorians\u0014\n   on both sides of the Atlantic indulged a naive materialism,\u0014\n   blind to the complex web of systemic sin that supported their\u0014\n   comfortable lifestyles. In their crusading Protestantism, they\u0014\n   sometimes slipped into an unpleasant ethnic and cultural\u0014\n   insularity. And they had a maddening habit of oversimplifying\u0014\n   moral issues, as they stuck their noses in every social nook\u0014\n   and cranny in search of vice to purge and souls to uplift.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But Louisa May Alcott's warm tale points to all that was good\u0014\n   about that earnest century. It was the age the Young Men's\u0014\n   Christian Association (YMCA) first provided young men newly\u0014\n   arrived in the burgeoning industrial cities a haven from those\u0014\n   cities' too-available and destructive social vices. It was the\u0014\n   time when thousands of Christians worked tirelessly to bring\u0014\n   about the abolition of slavery, while others campaigned\u0014\n   successfully for thoroughgoing reform of prisons and local\u0014\n   government. And it was the era of the successful reversal--\u0014\n   by the massive, woman-led temperance movement--of a\u0014\n   destructive national trend of drunkenness.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Victorians did--there's no getting around it--change\u0014\n   their society for the better. The reason? The transforming\u0014\n   power of the little books under their pillows.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Theirs was, in fact, the last thoroughly Christian society in\u0014\n   Western history.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The wars, social problems, and (most damagingly) material\u0014\n   prosperity of the 20th and 21st centuries have so far birthed\u0014\n   no comparable public Christian culture. We seem more distant\u0014\n   than ever from the Victorians, whose celebration of stronger,\u0014\n   purer virtues still cheers and challenges us from the poignant\u0014\n   pages of Little Women.\u0014\n\u0014\n   This Christmas, let's reawaken to the Victorians' vision of\u0014\n   families and societies healed by a gospel not just read, but\u0014\n   lived.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Merry Victorian Christmas, everyone.\u0014",

    "words": "IF YOU \nGOTTA GO, START EARLY\u0014\n\u0014\nMy friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and \nelegant, especially in her language. She and her husband were \nplanning a week's vacation in Florida, so she wrote to a particular \ncampground and asked for a reservation.\u0014\n\u0014\n     She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped, but \ndidn't know how to ask about the toilet in her letter. After much \ndeliberation, she finally came up with the old fashioned term \n\"bathroom commode\", but when she wrote that down, she still thought \nshe was being too forward. Se she started all over again, rewrote the \nentire letter, and referred to the bathroom commode merely as the \nB.C. Does the campground have its own B.C.?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, the campground owner wasn't old fashioned at all, and when he \ngot the letter, he just couldn't figure out what the woman was \ntalking about. That B.C. business really stumped him. After worrying \nabout it for awhile, he showed the letter to several campers but they \ncouldn't imagine what the\u0014\nlady meant either. So the campground owner finally came to the \nconclusion that the lady must be asking about the location of the \nBaptist Church, sat down and wrote the following reply.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Madam,\u0014\n\u0014\nI regret very much the delay in answering your letter, but I now take \nthe pleasure of informing you that a B.C. is located nine miles north \nof the camp- ground, and is capable of seating 250 people at one \ntime! I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of \ngoing regularly, but no doubt you will\u0014\nbe pleased to know that a great number of people take their lunches \nalong and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay late. \nThe last time my wife and I went was six years ago, and it was so \ncrowded that we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may \ninterest you to know that right now there is a supper planned to \nraise money to buy more seats. They're going to hold it in the \nbasement of the B.C. I would like to say it pains me very much not to \nbe able to go more regularly, but it sure is no lack of desire on my \npart. As we grow older, it seems to be more of an effort particularly \nin cold weather.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you do decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go \nwith you the first time you go, sit with you and introduce you to all \nthe other folks; remember this is a friendly community.\u0014",

    "words": "Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi couldn't have known it, but \nhis 1836 voyage from Marseilles to Rio de Janeiro would ultimately \nredraw the map of Europe. Two years earlier, at age 27, the young \nsailor had participated in a plot to liberate Italy from foreign \nrule. Caught and condemned to death, he escaped to France, where he \nboarded the fateful ship for Brazil.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill focused on rebellion, Garibaldi joined fellow exiles in the \nItalian League, a group of Italian expatriates, and championed \nUruguay's fight for independence from Argentina. In the besieged \ncapital of Montevideo, the League merged with a contingent of newly \nfreed slaves and, although vastly outnumbered, defeated the combined \nforces of the dictator of Argentina and the former Uruguayan \npresident. It was a stunning victory.\u0014\n\u0014\nAltogether, Garibaldi spent 12 years in Latin America, honing his \nskills in guerrilla warfare. In addition to his campaigns in Uruguay, \nhe fought with other rebels in Brazil, supporting the doomed cause of \na breakaway province, Rio Grande do Sul. His daring and cunning were \nlegendary, as was his stamina. Taken prisoner, he once endured being \nhung by the wrists for two hours as punishment for attempting escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1848, when he learned Italy was ready for revolution, Garibaldi \nsailed home to join the Risorgimento (Italian for \"resurgence\") and \nfought intermittently for 12 years. It was a difficult time, as he \nsuffered various defeats and betrayals, both military and political. \nHe was forced to flee his beloved Italy again, and traveled the world \nbefore returning in 1858. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1860, he used the guerrilla techniques he had learned in South \nAmerica to lead his small band of Red Shirts to victory against the \nenormous forces of Naples, conquering Sicily in only six weeks. \u0014\nHB Club\u0014",

    "words": "Is God Exciting Enough?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        The author of Still Bored in a Culture of  \nEntertainment says that increased stimulation has caused a  \"deadness \nof soul.\" What can turn it around?\u0014\n                  \u0014\n      Todd Hertz interviews Richard Winter  01/15/2003, Christianity \nToday\u0014\n\u0014\n                        In the foreword to his 1986 book, Amusing \nOurselves to Death, Neil Postman suggested that the culture Aldous \nHuxley envisioned in Brave New World   had become reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"As [Huxley] saw it, people will come to love \ntheir oppression [and] to adore the technologies that undo their \ncapacities to think,\" Postman wrote.   \"[What he] feared was that \nthere would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who \nwanted to read one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Postman argued that entertainment \ntechnologies had changed public discourse. As in Brave New World, \nPostman feared that an overload of information reduced culture to \npassivity and that\u0014\ntruth was lost in irrelevance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        In the new book Still Bored in a Culture of \nEntertainment (InterVarsity Press), author Richard Winter says that \nthe same cultural occurrence has  \"seduced and brainwashed\" people \naway\u0014\nfrom God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Christianity Today assistant online editor \nTodd Hertz spoke with Winter, a professor of practical theology at \nCovenant Seminary, about how technology and exciting entertainment \nhave created\u0014\nwhat he calls a \"deadness of soul.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                        What were you seeing in culture that you \nwanted to  address?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Everywhere I looked, I saw people using \nelectronic entertainment. My children come home at night with not \njust one video, but two or three. They also spend hours on end \nplaying computer\u0014\ngames with their friends. I began to wonder what effect this was \nhaving on them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        I explored the literature on boredom and came \nacross  this idea that overstimulation can lead to boredom as much as \nunderstimulation. People tend to lose the ability to develop their \nimagination and creativity because they're so dependent on input \ninstead of producing something themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        In her book Boredom: The Literary History of \na State of Mind, Patricia Spack wrote that the word boredom came into \nthe English language about 250 years ago. From then on, there has \nbeen an\u0014\nincredible rise in references to it in literature.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        You will see that technology boomed in the \nsame age.  Access to greater technology increases at the same time \nthat the use of the word boredom does in poetry and literature. \nPeople also now have much more leisure time at their disposal and \nshorter working days than they did back in the\u0014\n1800s.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        How does your theory differ from what Neil \nPostman argues?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        It's very much the same. His book title is so \ngreat:  Amusing Ourselves to Death. I have very similar themes, but I \nplace it in the Christian context because the decline of Christianity \nis a very\u0014\nsignificant factor in all of this. There's a parallel between the \nrise of these incidences of boredom\u0014\nand the decline of Christianity, faith, and spirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Does the lack of faith cause boredom, or has \nmore boredom created a lack of faith?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        I think it's a little bit of both. There's a \nvicious circlea deadness of soul leads to boredom, and boredom of \ncourse leads to deadness of soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Someone who is not a Christian [will \nexperience this deadness of soul] because they're cut off completely \nfrom God and from any bigger sense of  purpose and reality. On the \nother hand, when\u0014\na Christian becomes jaded and feels that God is far  away, this \nperson gets bored with prayer and\u0014\nwith Bible study. He or she then feels a certain deadness of soul as \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        [The problem] comes down to a loss of a \nbigger picture of life that, for a Christian, would give significance \nto all the small details of life. As I wash the dishes, work in the \ngarden, or vacuum, I\u0014\nsee it in the context of both the commitment to my relationship with \nmy wife and my family, but also as a commitment to God that I'm \ncalled to do these things. And Christ should be Lord of  every detail \nof my life. The seemingly boring, mundane things have a much greater \nsignificance in the big picture if you live with faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        In this culture, is God exciting enough?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        We're so dependent on things being exciting. \nEven as I listen to people giving announcements in churchespecially \nfor the youtheverything has got to be really exciting to grab their \nattention. There's a danger in our worship services when we try to \nbecome entertaining.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        It's of course good to use illustrations, \nvariety, visual aids, and so on, but one can go over the top so that \nit just becomes another theatrical production to give people a good \nfeeling, which  they then may mistake for an experience of God. But  \nreally it's just generated by the sort of entertainment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        God occasionally does amazing, wonderful, \nand  miraculous things. But most of the time, it is the ordinary \nthings of life that he works through. I think our dependence on this \nsort of\u0014\nhyperstimulation and busyness makes it very hard for  us to be \ncontent with the small things, with\u0014\nthe quieter moments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        How does this hurt a Christian's personal \nrelationship with God?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Overstimulation has led to a culture that has \ndifficulties with delayed gratification. We want\u0014\nthings now. We want instant spirituality and an instant relationship \nwith God. Most of the giants\u0014\nof the faith talk about the slow, steady, day-by-day  walk of \nobedience in faith without much drama and with the need for \ndiscipline.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        The dependence on electronic entertainment \ndoesn't  help us to do the hard work of daily\u0014\npractice. If someone wants to play the piano, but they  want to do it \ninstantly and they don't have patience, they get too bored with daily \nexercises on the piano. Our spiritual life is a bit like that. I \nstruggle with this too, to sit still in the presence of God and to \nread the Scriptures, to meditate, to pray. It's hard. I want to be \nup, busy, and active.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        I was speaking to someone just yesterday who \nsaid that he cannot stand the ordinariness of life. He wants action. \nHe wants all of God, or nothing. He wants God to come down and give \nhim a big  hug and make him feel wonderful, or, he doesn't want \nanything to do with God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        This culture also hurts your relationships \nwith other people and with nature. The real world, the natural world, \nruns at a slower pace. Things are more gentle than the drama of the \nelectronic entertainment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        I went to see the new James Bond film the \nother day,  and it's a classic example of how\u0014\nexcitement begets more excitement. The color, the sound, the action, \nall is up several notches\u0014\nfrom previous ones to keep people's attention. How  long can you go \non like this?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        How can we battle this overstimulation, not \nonly in our own lives, but also to the people\u0014\nwe minister to?\u0014\n\u0014\n                        It's about building relationships rather than \nhaving exciting events. It's in the context of\u0014\nrelationships that we make the most significant movement and growth \nin life. Even though high\u0014\ndrama events sometimes produce results, they often don't last very \nlong.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        That's the other thing that technology has \ndone. It's  given us lots of wonderful things, but it's helped to \nundermine community because we don't need to sit on the porch and we \nhave all our\u0014\nentertainment inside on the screen. Entertainment also undermines \ncommunity in the family\u0014\nbecause each person sits in front of their own screen. Or you all sit \nin front of the screen together but you don't talk to each other. So \nin every  way, technology cuts us off from relationships and from \nreality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Television suggests that life is high drama, \nlove, and sex. Activities such as housework,\u0014\nfundraising, and teaching children to read are vastly under reported. \nMost pleasures are small\u0014\npleasuresa hot shower, a sunset, a bowl of good soup, or a good book.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Todd Hertz is assistant online editor for \nChristianity\u0014\n  Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Is Reincarnation Real? \nThe Case of Parmod Sharma \u0014\n\u0014\nThe remarkable case of a 5-year-old boy who recalled detailed events \nfrom an Indian man's life, as documented by Ian Stevenson. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Christopher Bache \u0014\n\u0014\nReprinted from Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life with \npermission of the author.\u0014\n\u0014\nParmod Sharma was born on October 11, 1944, in Bisauli, India. When \nParmod was about two and a half, he began telling his mother not to \ncook his meals for him any longer because he had a wife in Moradabad \nwho could cook. Moradabad was a town about a ninety miles northeast \nof Bisauli. Between the ages of three and four, he began to speak in \ndetail of his life there. He described several businesses he had \nowned and operated with other members of his family. He particularly \nspoke of a shop that manufactured and sold biscuits (cookies) and \nsoda water, calling it \"Mohan Brothers.\" He insisted that he was one \nof the \"Mohan Brothers\" and that he also had a business in \nSaharanpur, a town about a hundred miles north of Moradabad\u0014\n\u0014\nParmod tended not to play with the other children in Bisauli but \npreferred to play by himself, building models of shops complete with \nelectrical wiring. He especially liked to make mud biscuits which he \nserved his family with tea or soda water. During this time he \nprovided many details about his shop including its size and location \nin Moradabad, what was sold there, and his activities connected to \nit, such as his business trips to Delhi. He even complained to his \nparents about the less prosperous financial condition of their home \ncompared to what he was used to as a successful merchant. \u0014\n\u0014\nParmod had a strong distaste for curd, which is quite unusual for an \nIndian child, and on one occasion even advised his father against \neating it, saying that it was dangerous. Parmod said that in his \nother life he had become seriously ill after eating too much curd one \nday. He had an equally strong dislike for being submerged in water, \nwhich might relate to his report that he had previously \"died in a \nbathtub.\" Parmod said that he had been married and had five \nchildren--four sons and one daughter. He was anxious to see his \nfamily again and frequently begged his parents to take him to back \nMoradabad to visit them. His family always refused his request, \nthough his mother did get him to begin school by promising to take \nhim to Moradabad when he had learned to read. \u0014\n\u0014\nParmod's parents never investigated or tried to verify their son's \nclaims, perhaps because of the Indian folk custom that children who \nremembered a previous life were fated to die early. News of Parmod's \nstatements, however, eventually reached the ears of a family in \nMoradabad named Mehra which fit many of the details of his story. The \nbrothers of this family owned several businesses in Moradabad \nincluding a biscuit and soda water shop named \"Mohan Brothers.\" The \nshop had been started and managed by Parmanand Mehra until his \nuntimely death on May 9, 1943, eighteen months before Parmod was \nborn. Parmanand had gorged himself on curd, one of his favorite \nfoods, at a wedding feast, and had subsequently developed a chronic \ngastrointestinal illness followed later by appendicitis and \nperitonitis from which he died. Two or three days before his death, \nhe had insisted, against his family's advice, on eating more curd \nsaying that he might not have another chance to enjoy it. \u0014\n\u0014\nParmanand had blamed his illness and impending death on overeating \ncurd. As part of his therapy during his appendicitis, Parmanand had \ntried a series of naturopathic bath treatments. While he had not in \nfact died in a bathtub, he had been given a bath immediately prior to \nhis death. Parmanand left a widow and five children--four sons and \none daughter. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the summer of 1949, the Mehra family decided to make the trip to \nBisauli to meet Parmod, who was a little under five years old at the \ntime. When they arrived, however, Parmod was away with his family and \nno contact was made. Shortly thereafter, Parmod's father responded to \nan invitation from the Mehra family and took him to Moradabad to \nexplore his son's compelling remembrances first hand. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who met Parmod at the railway station was Parmanand's \ncousin, Sri Karam Chand Mehra, who had been quite close to Parmanand. \nParmod threw his arms around him weeping, calling him \"older brother\" \nand saying, \"I am Parmanand.\" (It is common for Indians to call a \ncousin \"brother\" if the relationship is a close one, as was the case \nfor Parmanand and Karam.) Parmod then proceeded to find his way to \nthe \"Mohan Brothers\" shop on his own, giving instructions to the \ndriver of the carriage which brought them from the station. Entering \nthe shop, he complained that \"his\" special seat had been changed. (It \nis customary in India for the owner of a business to have an enclosed \nseat--a gaddi--located near the front of the store where he can greet \ncustomers and direct business.) The location of Parmanand's gaddi had \nin fact been changed some time after his death. Once inside Parmod \nasked, \"Who is looking after the bakery and soda water factory?\" This \nhad been Parmanand's responsibility. The complicated machine which \nmanufactured the soda water had been secretly disabled in order to \ntest Parmod. When shown it, however, Parmod knew exactly how it \nworked. Without any assistance, he located the disconnected hose and \ngave instructions in its repair.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLater at Parmanand's home, Parmod recognized the room where Parmanand \nhad slept and commented on a room screen that he correctly observed \nhad not been there in Parmanand's day. He also identified a \nparticular cupboard that Parmanand had kept his things in as well as \na special low table which had also been his. \"This is the one I used \nto use for my meals,\" he said. When Parmanand's mother entered the \nroom, he immediately recognized her and addressed her as \"Mother\" \nbefore anyone else present was able to say anything. He also \ncorrectly identified Parmanand's wife, acting somewhat embarrassed in \nfront of her. She was, after all, a full grown woman and he was only \nfive, though apparently possessing at least some of the feelings of \nan adult husband. When they were alone he said to her, \"I have come \nbut you have not fixed bindi,\" referring to the red dot worn on the \nforehead by Hindu wives. He also reproached her for wearing a white \nsari, the appropriate dress for a Hindu widow, instead of the colored \nsari worn by wives. \u0014\n\u0014\nParmod correctly recognized Parmanand's daughter and the one son who \nwas at the house when he had arrived. When Parmanand's youngest son \nwho had been at school showed up later, Parmod correctly identified \nhim as well, using his familiar name, Gordhan. In their conversation \nParmod would not allow the older Gordhan to address him by his first \nname but insisted that he call him \"father.\" \"I have only become \nsmall,\" he said. During this visit Parmod also correctly identified \none of Parmanand's brothers and a nephew. \u0014\n\u0014\nParmod showed a striking knowledge for the details of Parmanand's \nworld. While touring the hotel the Mehra brothers owned in Moradabad, \nthe Victory Hotel, Parmod commented on the new sheds that had been \nbuilt on the property. The Mehra family confirmed that these had \nindeed been added after Parmanand's death. Entering the hotel Parmod \npointed to some cupboards and said, \"These are the almirahs I had \nconstructed in Churchill House.\" Churchill House was the name of a \nsecond hotel the Mehra brothers owned in Saharanpur, a town about a \nhundred miles north of Moradabad. Parmanand had, in fact, had these \ncupboards constructed for Churchill house during his life. Shortly \nafter Parmanand's death, however, the family had decided to move \nthese cupboards to the Victory Hotel. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn a visit to Saharanpur later that fall, Parmod spontaneously \nidentified a doctor known to Parmanand in that city. \"He is a doctor \nand an old friend of mine,\" he said. During that visit he also \nrecognized a man named Yasmin whom he insisted owned him (Parmanand) \nmoney. \"I have to get some money back from you,\" he said. At first \nYasmin was reluctant to acknowledge the loan, but after being \nreassured that the Mehra family was not going to press for repayment, \nhe admitted that Parmod was quite right about the debt. \u0014\n\u0014\nStevenson reports that he has collected over 3,000 such cases, but \nhas published only a small percentage of the cases investigated. He \nthrows out most of the cases because they do not meet the highest \ncriteria of credibility. For example, he dismisses any cases where \nthe family of the second personality has profited in any way from \ncontact with the family of the first personality, either financially \nor in social prestige or attention. (Stevenson himself never pays his \nsources.) He also throws out cases where the two families are linked \nby a person who might have inadvertently transmitted information from \none family to the other. Furthermore, some cases turn out to be \nexplainable in terms of cryptomnesia, or \"hidden memories.\" In these \ncases, someone acquires information through entirely natural means, \nsuch as overhearing a conversation or reading a novel, and then \nforgets the circumstances in which they learned it. Later something \ntriggers the information which subjectively appears to come \"out of \nnowhere.\" Perhaps from a former life, we think. Yet in hypnotic \nregression, the true source of the information is revealed. Case \ndismissed. Cases where testimony is inconsistent, where witnesses are \nof questionable character, or where there is even the slightest \nindication of possible fraud are also immediately dropped. \u0014\n\u0014\nStevenson has published only the strongest cases, those involving no \ngain, no evidence of ulterior motive, no previous connection between \nfamilies, generous recall of details which can be confirmed by \nassociates of the former personality, and ideally the opportunity to \nbring together the second personality with persons known by the first \npersonality. His cautious skepticism and critical methods have earned \nhim the attention of even quite conservative professional journals. \nIn 1977, the distinguished Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease \ndevoted almost an entire issue to his research. In an editorial \njustifying this attention, Dr. Eugene Brody wrote: \"Our decision to \npublish this material recognizes the scientific and personal \ncredibility of the authors, the legitimacy of their research methods, \nand the conformity of their reasoning to the usual canons of rational \nthought.\" Two years earlier, in a review of the first volume of Cases \nof the Reincarnation Type in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, Dr. Lester S. King concluded that Stevenson had \n\"painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases \nin India, cases in which the evidence for reincarnation is difficult \nto understand on any other grounds....[H]e has placed on record a \nlarge amount of data that cannot be ignored.\"\u0014",

One of the officials told me that they had agreed to \nmeet the writer, Michael Drosnin, author of a Nostradamus-style best \nseller, without understanding that he was promoting Biblical \nprophecy. Still, rather than shoo him away, they listened politely as \nhe consumed several man-hours of valuable intelligence-crunching \ntime.

(Many \nevangelicals love Israel because in their Biblical end-of-days \nscenario, the gathering of Jews in the Holy Land is necessary for the \nSecond Coming.

    "title": "IRAQUI CHRISTIANS' PATH OF PERSECUTION",
    "words": "Iraqi Christians' Path of Persecution\u0014\nNot heresy hunters, nor Islamic purges, nor even Mongol hordes could \nwipe Christianity from Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Collin Hansen | posted 03/06/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the winds of an Iraq war are gusting ominously, peace advocates \nfrom across the religious and ethnic spectrum are joining forces. \nPope John Paul II turned more than a few heads on Valentine's Day by \nhosting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz at the Vatican and \nasking God to bless Iraq. But these two men share more than just a \ndesire to avoid war: Aziz is a baptized Chaldean CatholicIraq's \nbranch of Roman Catholicism.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the ruthless and bloody history of Iraq's Ba'athist regime, \ncritics have questioned Aziz's Christian credentials. Still, the high \nprofile of a Catholic in Saddam Hussein's overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim \ngovernment has become a source of intrigue and curiosity. And it \nraises the larger question: How has Christianity fared in the history \nof Iraqthe geographic area that was once Mesopotamia? A few weeks \nago we examined the origins of Iraq's Christian minority from \nPentecost until Constantine's conversion in A.D. 312. Now we pick up \ntheir history from there.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite severe Persian Empire persecution, the ancient Mesopotamian \nChurch blossomed during the fourth century while allied with Antioch, \nwhich was a major early hub of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In \nA.D. 410, at the Council of Seleucia, the Persian church declared its \nseparation from Antioch.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after, these Persian Christians fell under the influence of \nNestorian teachings. Nestorius (d. 451), a patriarch of \nConstantinople, was condemned as a heretic by the Roman Church for \nleading his followers to question Jesus' dual nature as fully God and \nfully man. Many scholars of theology now believe poor Nestorius was \nmore misguided than mischievous. He did not intend to separate the \ndivine and human natures of Christ into distinct persons. But in his \nzeal to distinguish between those natures, he used unguarded language \nthat led to his banishment and the persecution of his followers, who \nbegan fleeing the Roman Empire in the fifth century to seek refuge in \nPersia and Mesopotamia.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next 600 years, the Nestorian Church developed into one of \nthe most successful missionary-sending churches in all Christendom. \nActive in international trade, Nestorians spread as far as northern \nChina. Their influence waned only when Islam gained regional \ndominance around A.D. 1000.\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam first appeared on the Mesopotamian scene in the seventh \ncentury. Ironically, it got its first and biggest boost from a \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time, the Persian Empire still exerted considerable influence. \nPersian ruler Chosroes II conquered Constantinople in 605 and by 615 \nand possessed every major city in the formerly Roman-controlled \nMiddle East. But thanks to their leader's unquenchable lust for \nwomen, the Persians' Empire began crumbling by the mid-seventh \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his harem of three thousand wives and twelve thousand female \nslaves, Chosroes II demanded to have a woman named Hadiqah, the \ndaughter of a Christian Arab named Na'aman. Na'aman stood up to \nChosroes II because he wouldn't allow his daughter to marry a \nZoroastrian. Chosroes II, enraged, trampled him with an elephant. \nInfuriated and emboldened after hearing the story, Arabs rose up and \nthoroughly defeated Chosroes II. The victory marked the beginning of \na period of Arab assertiveness that culminated in the later Islamic \nconquests.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1000, an entrenched and powerful Islam had greatly curtailed the \nChristian influence in Persia and Mesopotamia. Already suffering from \nIslam's territorial and religious gains, the Nestorian Church was \nfurther weakened by internal dissent and corrupt church leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what really pushed Mesopotamian Christians into irrelevance was \nthe thirteenth-century Mongol invasion of Genghis Khan. Khan had a \nChristian wife and was tolerant of Christianity. The Nestorians even \ntried to forge an alliance between European Christians and the \nMongols against Islam that would open all of Asia to Christianity. \nBut in the end the Mongols chose Muslim allies, and the Church in \nMesopotamia and Persia faded from sight. The Christians who had once \nmoved freely in Central Asia were now suppressed, indeed utterly \nexterminated east of the Kurdish mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman Catholic missionaries did somehow reach Mesopotamia and Persia \nin the thirteenth century. These missionaries labored among the \nNestorian Church remnant to restore doctrinal harmony. Finally, by \n1553, facing new problems in Europe with the Protestants, the Latin \nChurch gained new strength in the region by reconciling to itself \nsome Nestorians. Thus was the Chaldean Catholic Church formed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased in Baghdad, the Chaldeans are today the largest Christian group \nin Iraq, with about 240,000 adherents as of 1995. The old Nestorian \nChurch, now called the Assyrian Church of the East, claims about \n60,000. The nation's two largest evangelical Protestant churches \nclaim about 13,500 adherents. By David Barrett's estimate, many \nbelievers in the older churches have also been touched by the rapid \nspread of the Pentecostal/charismatic renewal.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of these numbers would doubtless be much higher were it not for \nthe bloody twentieth century. After World War I, Mesopotamian \nChristians initially benefited from the British Mandate by receiving \nspecial privileges. But when the League of Nations created an \nindependent Iraq in 1932, Assyrian cities were burned and Christians \nkilled for their ties with the former Western rulers. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 35 years since Hussein brought the Ba'ath Party into power, he \nhas denied the separate religious identity of Iraqi Christians in an \neffort to construct a secular Arab nationalist state. He has tried to \nstamp out their Syriac language by banning it from many of the \nschools. In an effort to boost his Islamic credibility, Hussein has \nforced Christians to learn the Koran. And he has often lumped them in \nthe same ethnic category as the Kurds, knowing the groups don't get \nalong because of disputed land holdings in oil-rich northern Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a history of world isolation, Iraqi Christians don't maintain \nmuch tolerance for traitors. So there's a reason the highest-ranking \nChristian in the anti-Hussein Iraqi National Congress calls Aziz the \nmost hated man among Iraq's beleaguered Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n* For further information on topics treated here, albeit from an \nolder and biased source, see the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on \nChaldean Christians, Nestorianism, and the History of Persia.\u0014\n* For statistics on Christianity in late twentieth-century Iraq, see \nDavid B.

    "words": "With their marriage, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella forged the \nboundaries of modern Spain. During a 10-year war to expel the Moslem \nMoors and unify Spain, they pioneered mobile field hospitals and \ndeveloped superior infantry tactics that helped Spain dominate Europe \nwell into the 17th century. Yet they remain most famous for backing \nChristopher Columbus. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1486, Columbus asked Isabella to fund a westward voyage of \ndiscovery, one he claimed would find a short and lucrative route to \nChina. Unfortunately, she and Ferdinand were at war with the Moors, \nso they rejected him. In 1492, however, the Moors were defeated, and \nIsabella and Ferdinand were in a better position to support \nexploration. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his difficult years of waiting, Columbus had befriended Luis \nde Santangel, Keeper of the Privy Purse for King Ferdinand. Santangel \nwas also co-treasurer of the Santa Hermandad, a vigilante group that \nhad captured many of the bandits terrorizing Spain during the Moorish \nwars and confiscated their considerable booty. Ferdinand and Isabella \nagain rejected Columbus's request as too expensive, but Santangel \noffered a suggestion. \u0014\n\u0014\nSantangel assured Her Majesty that Columbus's venture could be \nfinanced with little royal money. The bulk of the funds would come \nfrom Santa Hermandad's confiscated goods, with the state paying only \nthe seamen's wages. Santangel added that such a negligible amount \ncould easily come from taxes. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsabella agreed. Santangel put up some 1.5 million maravedis, and \nColumbus himself raised an additional 250,000 maravedis. Isabella \nprovided the rest by levying a special tax on Seville's butchers (The \npopular belief that she financed the voyage by selling her jewelry is \nmere legend.) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe final cost to the crown for what was dubbed the Enterprise of the \nIndies, or \"history's biggest bargain,\" was under 250,000 maravedis, \nless than what a wealthy Spanish marquis might make in a month. Or, \nas Santangel put it, \"no more than what the Crown spent entertaining \na visiting dignitary for a week.\" It was a small price to pay, indeed.\u0014",

    "words": "Years ago, when the Betty Crocker company first began selling their \ncake\u0014\nmixes, they offered a product which  only needed water. All you had \nto do\u0014\nwas add water to the mix which came in the box, and you would get a\u0014\nperfect, delicious cake every time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt bombed. No one bought it and the company couldn't understand why, \nso they\u0014\ncommissioned a study  which brought back a surprising answer. It \nseemed that\u0014\npeople weren't buying the cake mix because it was  too easy. They \ndidn't\u0014\nwant to be totally excluded from the work of preparing a cake; they \nwanted\u0014\nto feel that they were contributing something to it. So, Betty Crocker\u0014\nchanged the formula and required the customer to  add an egg in \naddition to\u0014\nwater. Immediately, the new cake mix was a huge success. \nUnfortunately, many\u0014\npeople make the same mistake when it comes to \"packaging\" or \npresenting the\u0014\nChristian religion. They try to  make the call of Jesus Christ as \neasy as\u0014\npossible because they're afraid people won't \"buy it\" if it seems \ntoo  hard.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it \nremains\u0014\nonly a single seed. But if it dies it  bears much fruit. Jesus then\u0014\nexplained what he meant. He said, \"The man who loves his life will \nlose it,\u0014\nwhile  the man who hates his life in this world will keep it.\" It's \ntrue in\u0014\nlife isn't it? If we are going to get anything out  of it we have to \ninvest\u0014\noursleves in it. Do you remember the second to last album by the \nBeatles? It\u0014\nwas called  \"Abbey Road\" and for my money it was their best. The last \nsong\u0014\nis a little musical reprise called \"The End.\"  It's the last lyrical\u0014\nstatement the Beatles make on the album. And it went, \"And in the end \nthe\u0014\nlove you take is  equal to the love you make.\"\u0014",

    "words": "INSPIRING OTHERS\u0014\n   Motivation is a skill that can be learned.\u0014\n   by Rick Ezell\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"I'm no orator,\" Theodore Roosevelt once said, \"and in writing\u0014\n   I'm afraid I'm not gifted at all.... If I have anything at\u0014\n   all resembling genius it is the gift for leadership.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   There was nothing attractive about Roosevelt. He stood no\u0014\n   taller than five feet, nine inches, and was built like a\u0014\n   barrel. His blue eyes squinted out nearsightedly through\u0014\n   pince-nez, and his brown moustache framed teeth so large and\u0014\n   white they sometimes frightened friends as well as enemies.\u0014\n   His voice was high-pitched, even squeaky.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Yet, the vivid force of his character and personality, his\u0014\n   unabashed, contagious joy in taking charge made the\u0014\n   difference. He was a leader of monumental proportions. A\u0014\n   political foe called him \"a steam-engine in trousers.\" A\u0014\n   British visitor thought him comparable only to Niagara Falls\u0014\n   among the natural wonders of the New World. His ability to\u0014\n   lead--and the rugged, restless, constitution that went along\u0014\n   with it--was not really a gift at all, but a hard-won\u0014\n   achievement. To an extraordinary degree, Teddy Roosevelt was\u0014\n   his own creation.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Elected as U.S. President at age 42, he was just 50 when he\u0014\n   left the White House, and only 61 when he died. As the\u0014\n   pallbearers carried his coffin through the snow-covered trees\u0014\n   to a hilltop grave at Oyster Bay, and the family followed\u0014\n   along behind it, a New York police captain said to his sister:\u0014\n   \"Do you remember the fun of him, Mrs. Robinson? It was not\u0014\n   only that he was a great man, but, oh, there was such fun in\u0014\n   being led by him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   I would like to be a leader like that: one whom my\u0014\n   constituents would have fun in following. As I have studied\u0014\n   leadership--the common denominator of organizations, churches,\u0014\n   and families living on the cutting edge--I have discovered\u0014\n   that being an effective leader is neither easy nor accidental.\u0014\n   Effective leaders are made not born. They are those rare\u0014\n   individuals who know where they are going, communicate that\u0014\n   purpose to others, and fuel the fires that bring others\u0014\n   alongside of them. They are truly a joy to follow.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The people who make an impact on the world are not necessarily\u0014\n   geniuses, or the best looking, or the most talented, but those\u0014\n   who can inspire others to action. Nehemiah had that remarkable\u0014\n   ability to influence and inspire and rally people to action.\u0014\n   \"But now I told them, 'You know full well the tragedy of our\u0014\n   city; it lies in ruins and its gates are burned. Let us\u0014\n   rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and rid ourselves of this\u0014\n   disgrace!'\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Then I told them about the desire God had put into my heart,\u0014\n   and of my conversation with the king, and the plan to which he\u0014\n   had agreed.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"They replied at once, 'Good! Let's rebuild the wall!' And so\u0014\n   the work began\" (Neh. 2:17-18 LB).\u0014\n\u0014\n   Remember these people in a difficult situation. The only\u0014\n   difference was one man with God's vision who motivated others\u0014\n   to put their hearts into the work. Nehemiah possessed the\u0014\n   quality that could bring out the best in others.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Have you ever wondered at the way certain people bring out the\u0014\n   best in others? We have all known them--coaches, teachers,\u0014\n   parents, bosses. They seem to possess a knack for inspiring\u0014\n   people. But how do they do it? How do they inspire and\u0014\n   motivate people?\u0014\n\u0014\n     The Green Bay Packers had been hapless for twelve years before\u0014\n   the arrival of Vince Lombardi. The legendary coach turned his\u0014\n   team into the dominant NFL team of the 1960s. Why such a\u0014\n   phenomenal turnaround? Frank Gifford says it was not\u0014\n   Lombardi's knowledge, since several coaches knew as much about\u0014\n   strategy and tactics. Rather, it was his ability to motivate\u0014\n   the players. \"He could get that extra ten percent out of an\u0014\n   individual,\" Gifford says. \"Multiply ten percent times forty\u0014\n   men on the team times fourteen games a season--and you're\u0014\n   going to win.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Rick Ezell is pastor of Naperville Baptist Church in\u0014\n   Naperville, Illinois.

It depicts the preparation and execution of the plan to \ncapture Eichmann, who escaped from Germany and years later was living \nin Buenos Aires, Argentina. \u0014\n\u0014\nCaptured in Argentina, Eichmann lies in bed, ankles shackled, while \nan Israeli agent, Maxi, guards Eichmann, waiting for an opportunity \nto smuggle him out of Argentina. \u0014\n\u0014\nEichmann sits up on the bed and inches himself closer to Maxi, who is \nsitting on a chair reading a book. Eichmann tells him his oath as an \nS.S. Officer was to Hitler personally. He was only released from that \noath once Hitler died. \"He was like my father. Strong personality. \nWhatever I did I always asked myself, 'If the Fuhrer hears of my \nactions, will he approve?'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaxi replies, \"And the answer was always yes. When the Fuhrer said, \n'Kill the Jews,' you killed the Jews.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEichmann clarifies, \"No, I did not kill any Jews. I was in charge of \ntransport. Nothing more. My sole responsibility was shipment, \ntransportation, and organizing the trains.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaxi has an incredulous look on his face, stands up, and says in a \nlow, emotional voice, \"But you knew where those trains were going. \nYou knew you were sending millions of people to camps.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, I know that but\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You knew that these camps had gas chambers and crematories. You knew \nthat every Jew you shipped would be gassed or shot or starved or \nworked to death. You knew that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEichmann responds, \"That was not my province. Once the shipments were \ncomplete, my responsibility ceased. My duties ended at the gates of \nthe camps. Besides, hundreds of thousands survived. That's a fact, \nMaxi. I had nothing to do with the concentration camps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaxi reiterates, \"You knew that.\" He turns around, opens the door, \nand calls for relief. \u0014\n\u0014\nEichmann has an annoyed look on his face and says, \"You misunderstand \nme, Maxi.\" He lies back on the bed as another agent enters and \nreplaces Maxi. \u0014\n\u0014\nElapsed time: Measured from the beginning of the opening credit, this \nscene begins at 01:02:30 and ends at 01:04:52.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: The Man Who Captured Eichmann (Turner Pictures, 1996), \nwritten by Peter Z.

Yes, and this is the \nUnited \u0014\nStates of America, a country founded on Christian principles. \u0014\nAnd we are in the Bible Belt.

    "title": "ISAAC BACKUS, EARLY AMERICAN HERO",
    "words": "Isaac \nBackus\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Isaac Backus was born in a Connecticut farmhouse in \n1724. His\u0014\n                 family was Congregationalists and it was that faith \nin which he\u0014\n                 was raised throughout his formative years. Few \npeople are\u0014\n                 allowed to live during such important times as Isaac \nBackus\u0014\n                 was. He was just reaching denominational stature as \nthe\u0014\n                 American Revolution began. Indeed, Backus thoughts \nand\u0014\n                 beliefs can be seen echoed in much of the \nConstitution and Bill\u0014\n                 of Rights.Backus was a spiritual child of the Great \nAwakening\u0014\n                 and his conversion is directly linked to the work of \nJonathan\u0014\n                 Edwards and George Whitefield. The writings of \nEdwards\u0014\n                 influenced more than one Baptist as can be seen in \nthe life of\u0014\n                 Backus and John Bunyan. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It is not too much of stretch also to think that \nEdwards example as a pastor had much\u0014\n                 influence on many American Baptists. Though a \nCongregationalist, Edwards came to\u0014\n                 reject the half-way covenant of his own grandfather \nSolomon Stoddard. Edwards firmly\u0014\n                 believed than only the truly converted should \npartake of communion. Such was a radical\u0014\n                 shift from the practices of New England church of \nthe time. If Edwards writing influenced\u0014\n                 then Whitefields preaching did even more. It was \nthrough a preacher influenced by\u0014\n                 Whitefield that Backus came to know the God of whom \nhe had heard most of his life.\u0014\n                 Sometime after hearing the aforementioned visiting \npreacher Backus wrote: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"As I was mowing alone in the field, August \n24th 1741, all my past life was\u0014\n                      opened plainly before me, and I saw clearly \nthat it had been filled up with\u0014\n                      sin. I went and sat down in the shade of a \ntree, where my prayers and tears,\u0014\n                      my hearing of the Word of God and striving for \na better heart, with all my\u0014\n                      other doings, were set before me in such a \nlight that I perceived I would\u0014\n                      never make myself better, should I live ever so \nlong. Divine justice\u0014\n                      appeared clear in my condemnation, and I saw \nthat God had a right to do\u0014\n                      with me as He would. My soul yielded all into \nHis hands, fell at His feet, and\u0014\n                      was silent and calm before Him  The Word of \nGod and the promises of\u0014\n                      His grace appeared firmer than a rock, and I \nwas astonished at my\u0014\n                      previous unbelief. My heavy burden was gone, \ntormenting fears were fled,\u0014\n                      and my joy was unspeakable.\"1 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Backus was foremost a pastor; but his importance to \nAmerican Baptist and the Church in\u0014\n                 general is immense. \"The role which Backus played \nduring the formative years of his\u0014\n                 denomination in America was so crucial that he has \nbeen termed the father of American\u0014\n                 Baptists.\"2 Backus restored to Baptists their \ntheological roots which had been mostly lost\u0014\n                 in the years prior to His ministry. He, became the \nchief spokesman for the evangelical\u0014\n                 Calvinism which replaced the Arminianism prevalent \namong the older Baptist churches.\u0014\n                 In spite of the Calvinism of the earliest New \nEngland Baptists, a shift to the Arminian\u0014\n                 outlook had been completed by the time of the \nAwakening. The  Separate Baptists \u0014\n                 largely followed the evangelical Calvinism of \nJonathan Edwards  Backus was their\u0014\n                 chief spokesman, articulating in the Baptist context \nthe themes of sovereign grace which\u0014\n                 had been so eloquently espoused by Edwards.\" 3\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Much of his latter life was given to writing against \nthe inroads of Arminianism which\u0014\n                 ultimately led to Universalism. Disregarding the \ntrend of his time, Backus staunchly\u0014\n                 upheld the traditional doctrines of Grace and warned \nof the dangers of straying from them.\u0014\n                 Like other Baptists (i.e. Bunyan and Fuller), Backus \nfelt he was going back to Calvinism in\u0014\n                 its purest form. He saw Gods sovereignty and mans \nindividual responsibility as both\u0014\n                 being necessary and Scriptural.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"For Backus, God was the governor of the \nuniverse to whom all earthly civil\u0014\n                      governments must appeal \" At the same time man \nis individually\u0014\n                      responsible to God. \"Religion is ever a matter \nbetween God and the\u0014\n                      individuals .\" In short, religion is a \nrelationship between the individual and\u0014\n                      God, mediated only by the Holy Spirit illumined \nby Scripture.\"4\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Like other Baptist, however, Backus did not fall in \nlock step with the Covenant Theology of\u0014\n                 most other Puritans. Many other books have been \nwritten on this subject so little time will\u0014\n                 be spent here. Backus strove valiantly to uphold the \nPuritan concept of a theocratic\u0014\n                 kingdom (God ruling all men through the Church), but \nScripture would not allow him to.\u0014\n                 The same Scriptures which led Backus to see his need \nfor personal salvation also led\u0014\n                 him to see the very personal nature of Gods call to \nman in all areas of life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Backus and Baptist are often misunderstood as making \nbaptism itself a test of\u0014\n                 Christianity. While Baptist do emphasize immersion, \nthat is not the core issue. To Backus,\u0014\n                 it was the Believer part of believers baptism that \nmost concerned him. Covenant theology\u0014\n                 in New England had to come to allow just about \nanyone to be a member of the church and\u0014\n                 to partake of communion. This weakness of the \nhalfway covenant to stress personal\u0014\n                 decision was what drove Backus from the \nCongregationalists to the Baptists. \"He argued\u0014\n                 that the earliest Christian congregations were those \njoined by believers baptized on\u0014\n                 profession of their faith  and that those \ncongregations were themselves independent of\u0014\n                 any superior earthly authority.\"5 \"The visible \nchurch He (God) had established upon earth\u0014\n                 was an assembly of true and real saints and ought \ntherefore to be inaccessible to the\u0014\n                 wicked and the unrighteous.\"6 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Theology always precedes application as can be seen \nin the natural conclusions Backus\u0014\n                 drew from Scripture. \"He rejected the Covenant \nTheology of the Puritans by arguing as the\u0014\n                 Baptists had long done that the Bible contained not \none covenant but two. The first of\u0014\n                 these was the old covenant of works made with the \nJews, and the second was the\u0014\n                 covenant of grace made with those who believe in \nChrist. The people and events of the\u0014\n                 Old Testament foreshadowed the work of Christ and \nthe apostles in the New Testament -\u0014\n                 the Gospel or Christian church is the anti-type of \nthe Jewish church or Israel and Jesus\u0014\n                 Christ is the anti-type of Abraham.\"7 Recognizing \nthis difference in the physical kingdom of\u0014\n                 Israel and the spiritual kingdom of the Church led \nBackus to formulate his views on the\u0014\n                 separation of Church and State. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Basic to the Baptist position was the belief that \nall direct connection between the State\u0014\n                 and institutionalized religion must be broken in \norder that America might become a truly\u0014\n                 Christian country.\"8 In other words, the Church \nshould not allow the State to govern in\u0014\n                 matters which belonged to the Church. Among these \ninfringements which Backus saw\u0014\n                 were taxation to support State churches, tax \nexemption only for churches with ministers\u0014\n                 recognized by civil authorities, and various other \nmatters. . In his last years, Backus fought\u0014\n                 against the desire by some Baptist churches to be \nincorporated by the state. This desire\u0014\n                 for civil recognition derived from the early \nAmerican policy of taxing citizens to provide\u0014\n                 salaries for ministers. Backus was totally opposed \nto this practice. Incorporation gave the\u0014\n                 State authority over the church and this was \nunacceptable.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Backus offered a Bill of Rights for consideration to \nfriends at the time of the writing of the\u0014\n                 American Constitution. His second right read as \nfollows:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"As God is the only worthy object of all \nreligious worship, and nothing can\u0014\n                      be true religion but a voluntary obedience unto \nHis revealed will  every\u0014\n                      person has an unalienable right to act in all \nreligious affairs according to\u0014\n                      the full persuasion of his own mind, where \nothers are not injured thereby\u0014\n                      \"\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Some in our present day have sought to use Roger \nWilliams and Isaac Backus as\u0014\n                 models for what they would have considered a \nperversion of the concept of separation of\u0014\n                 Church and State. Early Baptist never envisioned \ntheir words being used to strike down\u0014\n                 school prayer or to legitimatize non-Christian \nreligions. Their wall of separation was one\u0014\n                 between government and the Christian church alone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Backus principles of separation of church and \nstate  were not  the\u0014\n                      same as those set forth by Jefferson and \nMadison  Jefferson, who\u0014\n                      viewed all religious creeds and sects as \npotential tyrannies over the mind\u0014\n                      of man, explicitly denied that America was or \nshould be a Christian nation\u0014\n                       Backus and Baptists wanted to separate Church \nand State in order to\u0014\n                      create a truly Christian state in which men \nrendered to Caesar only what\u0014\n                      was truly Caesars and devote the bulk of their \nenergy to serving God\"9 \u0014\n\u0014\n                      NOTE: Footnotes to this article have been lost. \nWe hope to restore them\u0014\n                      soon.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Return to Portraits Page\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Baptist Page Articles are offered as a service \nto the readers of The Baptist Page.

He was \nsitting in the park just staring\u0014\n     at some pigeons.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The boy sat down next to him and opened his suitcase. He was \nabout to take a drink from his root\u0014\n     beer when he noticed that the old man looked hungry, so he \noffered him a donut. \u0014\n\u0014\n     He gratefully accepted it and smiled at him.\u0014\n\u0014\n     His smile was so incredible that the boy wanted to see it again, \nso he offered him a root beer.\u0014\n     Once again, he smiled at him.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The boy was delighted! They sat there all afternoon eating and \nsmiling, but they never said a\u0014\n     word.\u0014\n\u0014\n     As it grew dark, the boy realized how tired he was and he got up \nto leave, but before he had\u0014\n     gone more than a few steps, he turned around, ran back to the \nold man and gave him a hug.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The old man gave him his biggest smile ever.\u0014\n\u0014\n     When the boy opened the door to his own house a short time \nlater, his mother was surprised by\u0014\n     the look of joy on his face.

    "title": "IS MARRIAGE A DYING INSTITUTION?",
    "words": "Is marriage a 'dying' institution? \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nBy Bob Allen, Associated Baptist Press  \u0014\nMonday, June 20, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage is a dying institution, actress Cameron Diaz claimed \nrecently. And the movie star's assertion hit a nerve.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think we have to make our own rules, Diaz said in the June issue \nof Maxim magazine. I don't think we should live our lives in \nrelationships based off of old traditions that don't suit our world \nany longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe isn't alone. Fox News expert Keith Ablow roiled conservative \nviewers by not only applauding Diaz but adding that in his clinical \njudgment, marriage is -- as it has been for decades now -- a source \nof real suffering for the vast majority of married people. \u0014\n\u0014\nDiaz, 38, who famously has dated celebrities Justin Timberlake, Matt \nDillon and most recently New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez, \nrecently shared with Elle Magazine: I think a lot of people are \nmarried to people that they're not romantic with anymore. I just \ndidn't ever marry anybody that I then had to get divorced from. We \nbreak up. We move on.\u0014\n\u0014\nA conference in April by the conservative think tank Ethics and \nPublic Policy Center examined a retreat from marriage over the last \n50 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford Wilcox of the National Marriage Project at the University of \nVirginia said the United States has witnessed a dramatic retreat \nfrom marriage, marked by the declining role of marriage as the anchor \nfor the adult life course and the publicly recognized vehicle for \nlifelong love, sex and the bearing and rearing of children.\u0014\n\u0014\nFewer adults are getting married. The percentage of middle-aged \nadults who are married has declined from about 88 percent in 1960 to \nabout 66 percent today. Divorce has more than doubled since the 1960s \nbut recently has seen a slight decline, attributed in part to the \nfact that more and more couples are living together without getting \nmarried.\u0014\n\u0014\nStatistics just reported from last year's census show that for the \nfirst time, married couples are the minority in America, accounting \nfor 48 percent of all households. That's down from 52 percent 10 \nyears go. The number of opposite-sex couples who opt to live together \nwithout getting married is 7.5 million, up 13 percent from 2009.\u0014\n\u0014\nA \\May Gallup Poll found 60 percent of Americans now believe it is \nmorally acceptable for an unmarried man and woman to have sex, while \n36 percent believe it is morally wrong. More than half, 54 percent, \nsaid it is OK for a man and woman to have a baby outside of marriage, \ncompared to 36 percent who said it is morally wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly seven in 10, 69 percent, said divorce can be morally \nacceptable, compared to 23 percent who disagreed. Just 11 percent, \nhowever, said it is OK for a married person to have more than one \nspouse at a time and 91 percent said that it is immoral for a married \nman and woman to have an affair.\u0014\n\u0014\nCohabitation is competing with marriage not only as a place for sex \nbut more and more for child-bearing, Wilcox said. Fifty years ago, 5 \npercent of children were born out of wedlock. Today, 41 percent are \nborn outside of marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe retreat from marriage has hit poor and working families harder \nthan folks with a college degree, Wilcox said. In a December study \ndone with the \\Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for \nAmerican Values, Wilcox found that among the affluent, marriage is \nstable and perhaps getting even stronger. Among the poor, marriage \ncontinues to be fragile and weak. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the newest and perhaps most consequential marriage trend he \nsaid, is that marriage is foundering among Middle Americans, those \nwith a high-school diploma but not a college degree.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1980s, only 2 percent of babies born to highly educated \nmothers were born outside of marriage, compared to 13 percent of \nbabies born to moderately educated mothers and 33 percent of babies \nborn to mothers who were the least educated, the study reported. In \nthe late 2000s, only 6 percent of babies born to highly educated \nmothers were born outside of marriage, compared to 44 percent of \nbabies born to moderately educated mothers and 54 percent of babies \nborn to the least-educated mothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilcox said the children of highly educated parents now are more \nlikely than in the recent past to be living with their mother and \nfather, while children with moderately educated parents are far less \nlikely to be living with their mother and father.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat trend, he said, has implications for child-rearing. Studies show \nboys are about twice as likely to end up in prison by the time they \nturn age 32, if they don't have their father in the household. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe less a dad is around in the early years of a girl's childhood, \nthe more likely she is to become pregnant as a teenager. The risk \ndoubles if the dad leaves while she is in school. If he leaves before \nshe turns 6, it increases to seven times.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren also are more likely to suffer physical, sexual or emotional \nabuse if they don't grow up in an intact married family.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe retreat from marriage affects religion, because religion and \nmarriage seem to go together, Wilcox observed. Having children tends \nto lead parents either to return to church or become active for the \nfirst time, while houses of worship play a key role in the moral \neducation of kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know that congregations tend to offer social, religious and moral \nsupport to marriage, Wilcox said. People often are looking for that \nwhen they get married.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious congregations offer marriage-centered social networks that \ncan be valuable to couples who are looking for other folks to kind of \nhelp them through the joys and challenges of married life, he said.\u0014",

    "words": "Interpretation Sparks a Grave Theology Debate\u0014\n\u0014\nApologist's questioning of Matthew 27 creates theological war of \nwords. \u0014\nBobby Ross Jr. | posted 11/07/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA fiery debate has erupted over a leading Southern Baptist \napologist's questioning of Matthew 27. The question: whether \nMatthew's reference to many saints rising from their graves after \nJesus' resurrection might not be literal history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe theological war of words, spurred by high-profile open letters \nand retorts on the Internet, has raised questions about the meaning \nof biblical inerrancy. It has also led to the departure of Michael \nLicona as apologetics coordinator for the North American Mission \nBoard (NAMB).\u0014\nAt issue is a passage of Licona's 700-page The Resurrection of Jesus: \nA New Historiographical Approach, published in 2010 by InterVarsity \nPress.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Based on my reading of the Greco-Roman, Jewish, and biblical \nliterature, I proposed that the raised saints are best interpreted as \nMatthew's use of an apocalyptic symbol communicating that the Son of \nGod had just died,\" said Licona, research professor of New Testament \nat Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina.\u0014\nIn a series of open letters posted online, Norman Geisler, \ndistinguished professor of apologetics at Veritas Evangelical \nSeminary in Murrieta, California, objected to Licona's characterizing \nthe passage as a \"strange little text.\" Geisler accused Licona of \ndenying the full inerrancy of Scripture. He also called for Licona to \nrecant his interpretation, labeling it \"unorthodox, non-evangelical, \nand a dangerous precedent for the rest of evangelicalism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 2,800-word blog post, Albert Mohler, president of Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, praised \nLicona's book as \"virtually unprecedented in terms of evangelical \nscholarship\" and \"nothing less than a masterful defense of the \nhistoricity of the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Mohler devoted most of the post to criticizing what he called \nLicona's \"shocking and disastrous argument\" concerning the bodily \nresurrection of the saints.\u0014\nLicona replied to Geisler that additional research has led him to \nre-examine his position. \"At present I am just as inclined to \nunderstand the narrative  as a report of a factual (i.e., literal) \nevent as I am to view it as an apocalyptic symbol,\" Licona wrote.\u0014\nIn the wake of the controversy, a number of leading evangelical \nscholars came to Licona's defensesome publicly, others privately.\u0014\n\"I know a good number of evangelical seminary professors who have \nprivately expressed support for Mike Licona but cannot do so publicly \nfor fear of punitive measures,\" said Paul Copan, an apologist and \npresident of the Evangelical Philosophical Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn comments to Christianity Today, Craig Blomberg, a New Testament \nprofessor at Denver Seminary, complained of \"the tragedy of 'witch \nhunts' of this nature.\" He accused Licona's critics of \"going after \nfellow inerrantists with whom they disagree and making life miserable \nfor them for a long time in ways that are unnecessary, inappropriate, \nand counterproductive to the important issues of the Kingdom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Warren, director of the Center for New Testament Textual Studies \nat New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, said Licona has earned \nmore leeway than some in the evangelical academic community are \naffording him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What should be kept in mind,\" Warren said, \"is that a person who has \nbeen well-received, written prolifically in multiple contexts, and \ntaken firm stands in the apologetic arena in defense of orthodoxy \nsurely should not be tossed aside based on his interpretation of one \npassage in a massive volume.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel B. Wallace, New Testament professor at Dallas Theological \nSeminary, said he disagrees with Licona's interpretation but \nconsiders the issue hermeneutical, not a challenge to biblical \ninerrancy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If we view our own interpretation to be just as inerrant as the \nScriptures,\" he said, \"this could ironically elevate tradition and \nerode biblical authority.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlready, at least two Southern Baptist entitiesthe New Orleans \nseminary and the Southern Baptists of Texas Conventionhave rescinded \ninvitations for Licona to speak at apologetics conferences, Licona \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe NAMB, meanwhile, eliminated Licona's position. Licona said the \ndecision came after he offered to resign rather than cast a shadow \nover the board and its president, Kevin Ezell.\u0014\n\"I love NAMB and Kevin and wanted to protect them,\" Licona said. \n\"They then decided to make the call and eliminate my position. Now \nthat the issue has escalated far beyond what I had ever expected, it \nwas definitely a good decision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2011 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "It's Okay to Expect a Miracle\u0014\nScholar Craig Keener rediscovers the reality of divine intervention.\u0014\nInterview by Tim Stafford | posted 12/09/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nCraig Keener has the brain of a scholar and the hands of an activist. \nThe New Testament professor at Asbury Theological Seminary has \nauthored 15 books, 70 journal articles, and more than 100 articles \nfor religious and general interest publications. He and his wife, \nMdine Moussounga Keener, are deeply involved in ethnic \nreconciliation ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his New Testament commentaries, Keener has investigated biblical \nmiracles. But his newest volume\\Miracles: The Credibility of the New \nTestament Accounts (Baker Academic)focuses on contemporary miracle \naccounts, citing hundreds of recent occurrences.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeener is ordained in a historic African American church and served \nas an associate minister before moving to Asbury's campus in Wilmore, \nKentucky. Christianity Today senior writer Tim Stafford interviewed \nKeener this fall.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiracles are an unusual subject for a New Testament scholar. What led \nyou to it?\u0014\n\u0014\nI was going to write a footnote in my commentary on Acts, and was \ndealing with questions of historical reliability. Many scholars \ndismiss miracle stories as not historically plausible, arguing that \nthey arose as legendary accretions.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was familiar with [contemporary] reports of miracles taking place. \nThere must be thousands of such reports. It was inconceivable to me \nthat people would say eyewitnesses can't claim to have seen such \nthings.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do you want to accomplish with this book?\u0014\n\u0014\nPrimarily, to challenge scholars who dismiss miracles in the Gospels \nas legends and not historically plausible. Eyewitnesses say these \nkinds of things all the time. I also want to challenge the bias that \nsays these things can't be supernatural. I believe God does miracles, \nand I don't see why we scholars are not allowed to talk about it.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou're trying to break open the naturalistic tradition of writing \nhistory that scholars have followed for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nI understand the historical paradigms within which we work, and I'm \nable to work within those by bracketing out certain questions. But I \nwonder who made up the rule that we have to bracket out those \nquestions, and why we are obligated to follow such rules. The way the \ndiscipline of historiography has been defined, such questions get \npunted to philosophy or theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/Miracles\u0014",

    "words": "Mother With Cancer Sacrifices Her Life for Her Unborn Baby\u0014\n\u0014\nby Steven Ertelt | Washington, DC | LifeNews.com | 12/28/11\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery so often somewhere in the world, news reports surface of \nmothers who practice the kind of selfless sacrifice that should be \nencouragement for anyone  a willingness to sacrifice their own life \nfor their unborn child.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this latest case, Jenni Lake recently gave birth to a baby boy \njust one month before she turned 18. When lake found out she was \npregnant, she decided to forgo treatment for tumors on her brain and \nspine so she could carry the baby to term and give birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nDiana Phillips, Jennis mother, said that, when Lake was admitted to \nthe hospital as she told the nurse, Im done, I did what I was \nsupposed to. My baby is going to get here safe. The nurse would \nlater repeat the girls words to comfort her family when Lake passed \naway 12 days after the baby was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, photographs show a healthy baby with rosy cheeks who was born at \na healthy weight  a contrast to the frail Lake.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe migraines started last year, when Jenni was a 16-year-old \nsophomore at Pocatello High School. She was taken to the family \ndoctor, and an MRI scan found a small mass measuring about two \ncentimeters wide on the right side of her brain.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was sent to a hospital in Salt Lake City, some 150 miles south of \nPocatello, and another scan there showed the mass was bigger than \npreviously thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nJenni had a biopsy Oct. 15, 2010, and five days later was diagnosed \nwith stage three astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. With three \ntumors on her brain and three on her spine, Jenni was told her case \nwas rare because the cancer had spread from her brain to another part \nof her body with no symptoms.\u0014\n\u0014\nJenni started aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments, while \nalso posting videos on a YouTube site titled Jennis Journey, where \nshe hoped to share her story with updates every other day. She \nmanaged to upload only three videos, though, as her treatments left \nher tired and weak.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the start of treatment, she was told that she might never have \nchildren, her mother said, that the radiation and chemotherapy could \nessentially make her sterile.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when Jenni and her boyfriend Nathan learned she was pregnant, \nJenni had her mind made up.\u0014\n\u0014\nJenni, the third of her parents eight children, had always wanted to \nbe a mom. She had already determined to keep the baby when she went \nto see her oncologist, Dr. David Ririe, in Pocatello two days after \nshe found out she was pregnant.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe told us that if shes pregnant, she cant continue the \ntreatments, Phillips said. So she would either have to terminate \nthe pregnancy and continue the treatments, or stop the treatments, \nknowing that it could continue to grow again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no discussion about which path Jenni would choose. Her \nparents didnt think of it as a clear life or death decision, and \nJenni may not have, either. They believed that since the tumors had \nalready started to shrink earlier, she had a strong chance of \ncarrying the baby and then returning to treatment after he was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nJennis last words were about her son as he was placed beside her a \nfinal time, her father said. As she felt for the baby, she said: I \ncan kind of see him.\u0014\n\u0014\n------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nIdaho teen loses cancer fight after delivering son\u0014\n\u0014\nPOCATELLO, Idaho 12/27/11 (AP) -- Jenni Lake gave birth to a baby boy \nthe month before her 18th birthday, though she was not destined to \nbecome just another teenage mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat much, she knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile being admitted to the hospital, she pulled her nurse down to \nher at bed level and whispered into her ear. The nurse would later \nrepeat the girl's words to comfort her family, as their worst fears \nwere realized a day after Jenni's baby was born.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She told the nurse, `I'm done, I did what I was supposed to. My baby \nis going to get here safe,'\" said Diana Phillips, Jenni's mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn photographs, the baby's ruddy cheeks and healthy weight offer a \nstark contrast to the frail girl who gave birth to him. She holds the \nnewborn tightly, kissing the top of his head. Jenni, at 5 feet and 4 \ninches tall, weighed only 108 pounds at the full term of her \npregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nA day after the Nov. 9 birth, Phillips learned that her daughter's \ndecision to forgo treatment for tumors on her brain and spine so she \ncould carry the baby would have fatal repercussions. The cancer had \nmarked too much territory. Nothing could be done, Phillips said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was only 12 days past the birth - half spent in the hospital and \nthe other half at home - before Jenni was gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven so, her family and friends insist her legacy is not one centered \nin tragedy, but rather in sacrifice.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis month, her family gathered at their ranch style home in \nPocatello, where a Christmas tree in the living room was adorned with \nornaments picked out just for Jenni, including one in bright lime \ngreen, her favorite color. She had passed away in a bedroom down the \nhall.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecalling Jenni's infectious laugh and a rebellious streak, her \nmother held the baby close, nuzzling his head, and said, \"I want him \nto know everything about her, and what she did.\"\u0014\n---\u0014",

    "title": "IMMACULATE CONCEPTION BECAME CATHOLIC DOCTRINE",
    "words": "December 8, 1854 \u0014\nImmaculate Conception Became Catholic Doctrine\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Pius IX declared the Immaculate Conception of Mary an article of \nfaith on this day, December 8, 1854. According to his pronouncement \nin Ineffabilis Deus, Mary was given grace to be sinless at the \ninstant of her conception. Sin was shut out of her. The teaching was \ncontroversial among Christians at large. Neither Protestant nor \nOrthodox accept it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn general Christians insist that any major doctrine must be clearly \nbacked up by some Scripture. Catholics require the same. Yet, as \ntheCatholic Encyclopedia admits: \"No direct or categorical and \nstringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture.\" \nEdward O'Connor, compiling a massive defense of the belief went even \nfurther, acknowledging that the idea was not even a tradition of the \nearly church, coming to the fore about only 1100 AD.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to O'Connor, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was \n\"handicapped by the lack of any clear Scriptural evidence (or, \neven...any explicit patristic tradition) in its favor, but it even \nseemed to go counter to the clear teaching of St. Paul...and Christ's \nown declaration...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is more, many of the greatest fathers of the church and its \n\"doctors,\" explicitly rejected the idea. How could this belief be \naccepted when it is not taught in Scripture, had at best a weak early \ntradition, and was explicitly rejected by theologians of the highest \nrank?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the early church recognized that God chose Mary for a \nspecial place in His plan, countless sources both east and west show \nthat she was not considered sinless. However, in the eastern part of \nthe church, some theologians did write of Mary as pure and holy. Mary \nwas called the \"Mother of God\" and, in passing, some remarked that \nshe had a special flawless holiness. Gradually, in the western \nchurch, this belief became the assertion of an unfallen nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the twelfth century, the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary \nwas widely accepted in the Roman Church, although there was still \nstrong opposition to the belief. St. Thomas Aquinas especially \nobjected that, \"If the soul of the Blessed Virgin had never been \nstained with the contagion of original sin, this would have detracted \nfrom Christ's dignity as the savior of all men.\" Many others stood \nwith him. Thomas recognized that if Mary were without sin, she would \nnot need a Savior; the Bible would then be wrong in saying Jesus was \nthe Savior of all men and that \"all have sinned and fall short of the \nglory of God; there is none righteous, no not one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe thirteenth century philosopher Duns Scotus tried to sidestep \nAquinas' argument by saying that Mary's freedom from sin was a \nprivilege given to her on the basis of Christ's future merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth before and after the dogma was made binding on faithful \nCatholics by Pius to be \"firmly and constantly... believed by all the \nfaithful,\" theologians sought for new arguments to justify the \nteaching. Theology is a progressive science, they said. The church \ncomes to understand some mysteries only after pondering them a long \ntime in its heart. Mary was compared to a second Eve, sinless before \nher fall. How could Christ be born of flesh that was at some point in \ntime under Satan's dominion? they asked. They argued that just as the \nHoly Spirit set John the Baptist apart while he was still in the \nwomb, so Mary, to an even greater degree, was set apart. However, \nother theologians replied to all these arguments and raised other \nobjections--for instance, is it credible that Mary, a mere mortal, \nwithstood all temptation when even Christ, the living Son of God, \ncould overcome the gravest only by sweating blood?\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story. \u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur.

Her father-in-law was arrested on Monday evening, \naccording to Rahima Zarifi, the provincial director of womens \naffairs in Baghlan. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe police are still searching for her husband, Ghulam Sakhi, 30, a \nsoldier in the Afghan National Army who served in Helmand Province, \nthe Interior Ministry said. He had fled, officials said.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Hamid Karzai spoke out about the girls plight in a \nstatement on Sunday, saying that the case had to be pursued and that \nthe people responsible should be arrested. The swift official \nresponse may show a new willingness to help the plight of young women \nin this poor country, but it also highlights the suffering that \nofficials say is still common. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer mistreatment began after she was married six months ago, when she \nwas 14. The girl, from Badakhshan Province, and her husband did not \nknow each other well, Ms. Zarifi said. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen her new in-laws tried to force her into prostitution, she \nrefused, and they locked her in a downstairs bathroom in their home \nin Dahiney Ghuri in Pul-i-Kumri, the capital of Baghlan Province, \nInterior Ministry and provincial officials said. They would not let \nher call her family, and denied her food. They also beat her with a \nrod, officials said. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was released after her mother traveled to Baghlan and her uncle \nalerted the local police, who forced open the door to the room where \nshe was being kept. \u0014\n\u0014\nMunshi Abdul Majid, governor of Baghlan, said the search was \ncontinuing for the husband and for others responsible for the girls \nabuse.

It is \ncritical that policymakers and the public are educated about the \nfacts behind these fallacies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chambers Labor, Immigration & Employee Benefits Division has \nprepared this pamphlet to refute seven of the most common myths about \nimmigrants coming to our country.

    "words": "Israelis Facing a Seismic Rift Over Role of Women\u0014\nBy \\ETHAN BRONNER and ISABEL KERSHNER   January 14, 2012  New York \nTimes\u0014\n\u0014\nJERUSALEM  In the three months since the Israeli Health Ministry \nawarded a prize to a pediatrics professor for her book on hereditary \ndiseases common to Jews, her experience at the awards ceremony has \nbecome a rallying cry. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor, Channa Maayan, knew that the acting health minister, \nwho is ultra-Orthodox, and other religious people would be in \nattendance. So she wore a long-sleeve top and a long skirt. But that \nwas hardly enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did Dr. Maayan and her husband have to sit separately, as \nmen and women were segregated at the event, but she was instructed \nthat a male colleague would have to accept the award for her because \nwomen were not permitted on stage. \u0014\n\u0014\nThough shocked that this was happening at a government ceremony, Dr. \nMaayan bit her tongue. But others have not, and her story is entering \nthe pantheon of secular anger building as a battle rages in \\Israel \nfor control of the public space between the strictly religious and \neveryone else. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt a time when there is no progress on the \\Palestinian dispute, \nIsraelis are turning inward and discovering that an issue they had \nneglected  the place of the ultra-Orthodox Jews  has erupted into a \ncrisis. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it is centered on women. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust as secular nationalism and socialism posed challenges to the \nreligious establishment a century ago, today the issue is feminism, \nsaid Moshe Halbertal, a professor of Jewish philosophy at Hebrew \nUniversity. This is an immense ideological and moral challenge that \ntouches at the core of life, and just as it is affecting the Islamic \nworld, it is the main issue that the rabbis are losing sleep over. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe list of controversies grows weekly: Organizers of a conference \nlast week on women's health and Jewish law barred women from speaking \nfrom the podium, leading at least eight speakers to cancel; \nultra-Orthodox men spit \\on an 8-year-old girl whom they deemed \nimmodestly dressed; the chief rabbi of the air force resigned his \npost because the army declined to excuse ultra-Orthodox soldiers from \nattending events where female singers perform; protesters depicted \nthe Jerusalem police commander as Hitler on posters because he \ninstructed public bus lines with mixed-sex seating to drive through \nultra-Orthodox neighborhoods; vandals blacked out women's faces on \nJerusalem billboards. \u0014\n\u0014\nPublic discourse in Israel is suddenly dominated by a new, high-toned \nHebrew phrase, hadarat nashim, or the exclusion of women. The term \nis everywhere in recent weeks, rather like the way the phrase male \nchauvinism emerged decades ago in the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this seems anomalous to most people in a country where five \nyoung women just graduated from the air force's prestigious pilots \ncourse and a woman presides over the Supreme Court.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/Israelis Facing Seismic Rift \nOver Role of Women\u0014",

She competed in three more Olympic \ngames, winning a total of seven medals, and enjoyed a lucrative \nmodeling career on the side. At one point, she was the most \ndownloaded female athlete on the Internet. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet despite her astonishing career and sex-symbol status, Amanda felt \nunworthy of all her success. Unaware that she was suffering from \nclinical depression, she hid the pain beneath a megawatt smile.

In her late teens and \ntwenties, she became bulimic, abused drugs and alcohol, and started \ncutting herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer low self-esteem led to toxic relationships with high-profile men \nin the sports world.

In these pages, she speaks frankly about her struggles with \ndepression, the pressures to be thin, and the unhealthy relationships \nshe confused for love.

    "title": "IS CHRIST THE ONLY WAY TO GOD?",
    "words": "Faithful Christians have struggled with Peter's claim that salvation \ncomes only through Jesus. They've asked, \"What about those who've \nnever heard the gospel? What about those who are faithful \nparticipants in other religions?\" And in attempts to answer those \nquestions, various Christians have come up with no less than six \ndifferent positions, all of which are speculative:\u0014\n\u0014\n- Restrictivism: There is no hope of salvation apart from hearing the \ngospel and having faith in Christ before death.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Radical pluralism: Christ is one of many ways to God.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Universalism: Salvation is through Christ, but ultimately all will \nbe saved.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Universal evangelization before death: God ensures that everyone \nwho seeks God will in fact hear the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Eschatological evangelization: All who did not respond in this life \nwill receive an opportunity to respond after death.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Inclusivism: People who have never heard the gospel may obtain \nsalvation if they respond to the light they have.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of this list, Billy Graham, for example, would be an \ninclusivist. Speaking on Robert Schuller's \"Hour of Power\" program \nsome years ago, Graham said:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe body of Christ comes from all Christian groups around the world, \nor outside the Christian groups. I think everybody who loves Christ, \nor knows Christ, whether they are conscious of it or not, they are \nmembers of the body of Christ.... That's what God is doing today: He \nis calling people out of the world for his name, whether they come \nfrom the Muslim world or the Buddhist world or the Christian world or \nthe non-believing world, they are members of the body of Christ \nbecause they have been called by God. They may not even know the name \nof Jesus, but they know in their heart that they need something that \nthey don't have and they turn to the only light that they have, and I \nthink that they are saved and that they are going to be with us in \nheaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssuming Graham's right, then what Peter said about salvation being \nonly through Christ can be broadly understood. Graham and other \nChristians who take the inclusivist view allow for not only the \npossibility, but also the likelihood, that people outside of \nChristianity who respond to the light they have will enter eternal \nlife. (Jesus' remarks about the final judgment in Matthew 25 lend \nweight to the inclusivist position. He tells there of some people who \nhad no idea they were serving Jesus when they fed a hungry person or \nvisited a prisoner, but who are nonetheless welcomed into the kingdom \nof God.)\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither Graham nor other inclusivist Christians, however, say that \ntherefore it really doesn't matter whether one is a Christian or a \nfollower of some other religion. That's because salvation is much \nbroader than just what happens to a person after death. Salvation \nfirst affects the quality of life a person lives right here and now.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what can we affirm? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow, then, do we sort this out? Here are some things we can say with \nconfidence. You may want to add more thoughts of your own before \noffering these to the congregation: \u0014\n\u0014\n- Do I believe Christ came for all? Yes.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Do I believe Christianity is a valid path to God? Absolutely.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Do I believe there is some good in the other world religions? Yes.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Do I believe no one apart from direct knowledge of Christ may be \nsaved? I think the inclusivist view is right. People are judged \naccording to the light they have received and are convinced about. \nBeyond that, I leave this question to God.\u0014\n\u0014\n- Do I believe accepting Christ actually changes our lives and \nenriches life on this earth? Yes.\u0014",

The next day, the Hindus raided the \nChristian houses and tore up the texts they found, then locked 12 \nChristian families out of their homes for three days. The Indian \npolice are often complicit in anti-Christian persecution, sometimes \nharassing Christians themselves, and according toSajanGeorge of the \nGlobal Council of Indian Christians, the country's Christian minority \nis living in \"a climate of terror.\"\u0014\nReligion Today, 4/24/12\u0014",

    "words": "Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?\u0014\nThe Atlantic magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial mediafrom Facebook to Twitterhave made us more densely \nnetworked than ever. Yet for all this connectivity, new research \nsuggests that we have never been lonelier (or more narcissistic)and \nthat this loneliness is doing to our souls and our society.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy  Stephen Marche\u0014\n\u0014\nYvette Vickers, a former Playboy playmate and B-movie star, best \nknown for her role in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, would have been 83 \nlast August, but nobody knows exactly how old she was when she died. \nAccording to the Los Angeles coroner's report, she lay dead for the \nbetter part of a year before a neighbor and fellow actress, a woman \nnamed Susan Savage, noticed cobwebs and yellowing letters in her \nmailbox, reached through a broken window to unlock the door, and \npushed her way through the piles of junk mail and mounds of clothing \nthat barricaded the house. Upstairs, she found Vickers's body, \nmummified, near a heater that was still running. Her computer was on \ntoo, its glow permeating the empty space. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Los Angeles Times posted a story headlined Mummified Body of \nFormer Playboy Playmate Yvette Vickers Found in Her Benedict Canyon \nHome, which quickly went viral. Within two weeks, by Technorati's \ncount, Vickers's lonesome death was already the subject of 16,057 \nFacebook posts and 881 tweets. She had long been a horror-movie icon, \na symbol of Hollywood's capacity to exploit our most basic fears in \nthe silliest ways; now she was an icon of a new and different kind of \nhorror: our growing fear of loneliness. Certainly she received much \nmore attention in death than she did in the final years of her life. \nWith no children, no religious group, and no immediate social circle \nof any kind, she had begun, as an elderly woman, to look elsewhere \nfor companionship. Savage later told Los Angeles magazine that she \nhad searched Vickers's phone bills for clues about the life that led \nto such an end. In the months before her grotesque death, Vickers had \nmade calls not to friends or family but to distant fans who had found \nher through fan conventions and Internet sites. \u0014\n\u0014\nVickers's web of connections had grown broader but shallower, as has \nhappened for many of us. We are living in an isolation that would \nhave been unimaginable to our ancestors, and yet we have never been \nmore accessible. Over the past three decades, technology has \ndelivered to us a world in which we need not be out of contact for a \nfraction of a moment. In 2010, at a cost of $300 million, 800 miles \nof fiber-optic cable was laid between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \nand the New York Stock Exchange to shave three milliseconds off \ntrading times. Yet within this world of instant and absolute \u0014\n\u0014\ncommunication, unbounded by limits of time or space, we suffer from \nunprecedented alienation. We have never been more detached from one \nanother, or lonelier. In a world consumed by ever more novel modes of \nsocializing, we have less and less actual society. We live in an \naccelerating contradiction: the more connected we become, the \nlonelier we are. We were promised a global village; instead we \ninhabit the drab cul-de-sacs and endless freeways of a vast suburb of \ninformation. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the forefront of all this unexpectedly lonely interactivity is \nFacebook, with 845 million users and $3.7 billion in revenue last \nyear. The company hopes to raise $5 billion in an initial public \noffering later this spring, which will make it by far the largest \nInternet IPO in history. Some recent estimates put the company's \npotential value at $100 billion, which would make it larger than the \nglobal coffee industryone addiction preparing to surpass the other. \nFacebook's scale and reach are hard to comprehend: last summer, \nFacebook became, by some counts, the first Web site to receive 1 \ntrillion page views in a month. In the last three months of 2011, \nusers generated an average of 2.7 billion likes and comments every \nday. On whatever scale you care to judge Facebookas a company, as a \nculture, as a countryit is vast beyond imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nFores rest of article, see: World/My Documents/Is Facebook Making us \nLonely\u0014",

    "words": "IRS crackdown on foreign assets leading many to renounce U.S. \ncitizenship\u0014\n\u0014\nA growing number of U.S. citizens who live abroad and have bank \naccounts there are making a radical decision to avoid paying taxes: \nTheyre giving up their U.S. citizenship. \u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, 1,780 Americans relinquished their citizenship to avoid \ndisclosing foreign account information to the Internal Revenue \nService. This is a sharp increase over 2010, when 1,485 renounced \ncitizenship. In 2009, the number was 731 and in 2008 226.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe increasing numbers of Americans renouncing citizenship is the \nresult of an IRS crackdown: Within the past three years, the agency \nhas stepped up efforts to track down and prosecute U.S. citizens who \nevade taxes by hiding money and other financial assets in foreign \nbank accounts. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlan Weisberg, a prominent tax attorney with the Miami firm of \nWeisberg and Kainen, said he has noticed an increase in interest by \nsome clients in exploring the possibility of renouncing citizenship.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have seen more interest, but its not a floodgate yet, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of citizenship renunciations began rising in 2009, when \none of the worlds biggest banks, UBS AG of Switzerland, agreed to \ngive the United States the names of thousands of American clients \nwith secret bank accounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe landmark agreement came in the wake of charges in Fort Lauderdale \nfederal court against Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS AG employee \nwho later assisted the IRS in identifying thousands of tax evaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the IRS intensified its pressure, 200 to 400 Americans \nrelinquished citizenship annually.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number is expected to increase even more next year when foreign \nbanks will be required to supply information about U.S. clients bank \naccounts. Some banks abroad are already prohibiting Americans from \nopening accounts.\u0014\nEdward Robbins, a tax attorney in Beverly Hills, Calif., said that \nthe IRS crackdown is obviously linked to the wave of citizenship \nrenunciations.\u0014",

    "words": "Israel and Palestine: Is Peaceful Coexistence Possible?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Leroy Seat\u0014\nPosted: Monday, May 14, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nMay is a time of celebration in the modern nation of Israel. On May \n15, Israel will celebrate its 64th birthday, as the establishment of \nthe State of Israel took place on that day in 1948. \u0014\n\u0014\nPreviously, in October 1946, President Harry S. Truman issued a \nstatement indicating America's support for the creation of a \"viable \nJewish state.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn November of the following year, the United Nations voted for the \nJewish people to be given a \"homeland\" in the territory their \nancestors had inhabited nearly 2,000 years, or more, before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States was one of 33 countries that voted for the new \nJewish state.\u0014\n\u0014\nLess than a year after it was established as a nation in '48, Israel \nwas accepted by majority vote as a member of the United Nations on \nMay 11, 1949. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn passing, it is worth noting that the modern nation of Israel was \nestablished by the UN, an organization now much (and hypocritically?) \nmaligned by many people in this country who tend to be staunch \nsupporters of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was, and continues to be, a problem with the new state of \nIsrael, however. \u0014\nPalestine, the land that was partitioned and given to the Jewish \npeople as a homeland, was already occupied. It was inhabited largely \nby Arabs who were mostly Muslims (although about 10 percent of them \nwere Christians).\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the ethnic Jews from other countries began moving in and \noccupying the land, Palestinian Arabs have been squeezed into smaller \nand smaller portions of the territory. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot surprisingly, there was immediate negative Arab reaction to the \ncreation of Israel in May 1948.\u0014\nIn support of the Palestinian Arabs, the surrounding Arab states \nattacked the independent State of Israel on the very first day of its \nexistence. Thus began the first Arab-Israeli War.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though there have been numerous cease-fires, negotiations and \npeace talks, tensions and sporadic hostilities between Israel and \nPalestine have continued to the present. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not difficult to be sympathetic with Israel's desire for a \nhomeland. The holocaust in Europe resulted in the extermination of \naround 6 million Jews. That was an unmitigated human tragedy.\u0014\nAnd through the centuries Jewish people have been grossly mistreated \nby many Christians who considered all Jews to be \"Christ killers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is also hard not to be sympathetic with the Palestinian Arabs.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though about one-third of the population of the country was \nJewish at the time of the 1947 partition, still, for many of the \nArabs who made up the majority, land on which their ancestors had \nlived for centuries, in some cases, was taken from them and given to \npeople with a different language, different customs and a different \nreligion. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that since 1948 there have been many terrorist attacks on \nthe Israelis and other acts of violence committed by Palestinian \nArabs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if there is not provision for a peaceful and just settlement of \ndisputes, injustice and oppression usually spawns violent reaction.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo as Israel celebrates its 64th national birthday tomorrow, the \nburning question remains: Will Israel and Palestine ever be able to \ncoexist peacefully?\u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat was a missionary to Japan from 1966-2004 and is both \nprofessor emeritus of Seinan Gakuin University and pastor emeritus of \nFukuoka International Church.\u0014",

    "title": "I NEVER REALLY BELIEVED WHAT I HAD BEEN TAUGHT",
    "words": "In his autobiography, actor Alec Guinness tells a story that might \nkeep every pastor and church school teacher awake at night. He was a \nteenager and it was the morning of his confirmation. The classes were \nfinished. The students' heads had been filled full of Bible stories \nand theological doctrines. Guinness says Holy Trinity Church in \nEastbourne was crammed with confirmation candidates, their parents, \nfriends, schoolteachers, and sponsors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the appropriate moment, he notes, \"The girls, mostly in grey \nuniforms, filed up to kneel at the Bishop's left hand and the boys, \nin blue serge, to his right. I remember white episcopal hands and \nshaggy black eyebrows. A pale, greenish light filtered through the \nwindow-panes, giving a subaqueous hue to the perspiring \ncongregation.\" Then he adds, \"At the age of sixteen, one early summer \nday, I arose from under the hands of the Bishop of Lewes a confirmed \natheist . . . With a flash I realized I had never really believed \nwhat I had been taught.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't know about you, but I am troubled by that story. I believe in \nChristian education. God's people are called to teach the Christian \nfaith to children, teenagers, and adults. Sunday church school and \nconfirmation classes are important educational activities. The church \nneeds to do these things. And yet, here is the story of a bright, \nintelligent person who emerged from those experiences, and he did not \nbelieve a word of what he learned. As a professional church leader, \nas a Christian educator, that story bothers me.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a personal level, however, that story haunts me for another \nreason, namely, that it sounds surprisingly familiar. On a bright \nSunday morning, it is easy to affirm what we believe. As the familiar \nverse we've heard today puts it, \"God so loved the world that he gave \nhis only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but \nhave eternal life.\" With sunbeams shining through stained glass, I \ncan believe it. But late at night, after the lights are dimmed, \nsometimes I have my doubts, my questions, my lapses of belief.\u0014",

As \nhe sat in worship, he noted the Lincoln pew, which is set aside in \nthat church for presidents to sit in when they visit there for \nworship, and it's the pew in which Lincoln sat during the Civil War \nyears when he came to church. Suddenly there was a hush in the \ncongregation, and down the aisle walked Mr. Nixon with an usher who \nseated him in the Lincoln pew. Leon Jaworski, sitting several pews \nbehind that pew, recollected in his mind all that he knew from having \nlistened to the Nixon tapes. He knew that the president could be \nindicted for criminal activity beyond any shadow of doubt. There he \nsat in worship. He wondered in his own mind what would happen if the \npresident suddenly stood up and said to the pastor of the church, who \nwas Dr. George M. Docherty at the time, \"Dr. Docherty, I would like a \nmoment of special privilege,\" and then would turn to the congregation \nand say:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I want to say today that, as president of the United States, I have \nsinned before God and I have lied to you. I have asked his \nforgiveness and I now ask yours. I have come to this church today to \nmake full disclosure of who and what I am and what I have become. I \npromise you from this day forward I'm going to do better.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLeon Jaworski said if he had done that as he had turned it in his \nmind, we would have probably gathered the president up and put him on \nour shoulders and carried him back to the White House. It is a \nthought worth thinking about for all of us to acknowledge our sins.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Dr. W. Frank Harrington, \"Does the \u0014\nOval Office Reflect Who We Are?\" Peachtree Presbyterian Pulpit, 1998.\u0014",

The Christian minority in Indonesia faced 64 \ncases of violations of religious freedom last year, up from 47 in \n2010, said Theophilus Bela, president of the Jakarta Christian \nCommunication Forum. Bela said he was worried about the growing \nincidence of violence and church closures, as his group recorded just \n10 anti-Christian incidents in 2009. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt least 22 churches have been forced to close this year, including \n18 in the Singkil regency of Aceh Province that were \\sealed last \nmonth. Bela said that after his organization's intervention the \nclosed churches in Aceh began worshiping again on May 13, but \nunconfirmed reports indicate other churches in the area have since \nbeen forced to close.

    "words": "August 9, 2012  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nIslamists in North Mali Amputate Mans Hand\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ADAM NOSSITER\u0014\n\u0014\nDAKAR, Senegal  Islamists who control northern Mali have publicly \namputated the hand of a man they accused of robbery, continuing an \nincreasingly harsh application of what the vast regions new masters \nconsider sacred law. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe amputation took place Wednesday morning in the small town of \nAnsongo, just downriver from the provincial capital, Gao, which is \nunder the rule of an Islamist group, splintered off from Al Qaeda, \ncalled the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, or Mujao. \nIt was confirmed by a Mujao spokesman in Gao in a telephone \ninterview, and by the Malian government in a statement later from \nBamako, the capital. \u0014\n\u0014\nA witness in Ansongo said that the accused mans hand was placed on \na sort of table, in front of dozens of spectators, in the towns \nmain square. Then, a gentleman with a sort of cutlass  the witness \ndescribed him as an Arab  swung hard, and sliced off the mans \nhand, the witness said. He cut it. There was a lot of blood. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe held up the mans hand for the people, like a sort of trophy, \nthe witness, a local teacher, said Thursday in a telephone interview \nfrom Ansongo. He said, God is great. It was barbaric. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe requested anonymity because he said it was dangerous to speak even \nover the telephone about what was going on in the town. \u0014\n\u0014\nA spokesman for Mujao in Gao, Aliou Mahamar Tour, said Thursday by \ntelephone: They cut off the hand of a robber at Ansongo. Yes, yes, \nthey did this. He was a thief. He stole. God has told us to cut off \nthe hands of thieves. Its in the Koran. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust 11 days ago, in the desert town of Aguelhok, Islamist allies of \nMujao publicly stoned to death a young couple accused of having \nchildren outside wedlock. The stoning and now the amputation appear \nto signal an acceleration of the Islamists determination to apply \nShariah law to the territory they conquered from the Malian \ngovernment in March and April. Already, the Islamists have driven \nnearly 400,000 people to flee northern Mali and have spurred calls \nfor a regional intervention force. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe extremists who are occupying northern Mali have cut off the hand \nof an inhabitant of Ansongo, adding a new ignoble act to the long \nlist of atrocities they have inflicted on the people, the Malian \ngovernment said in a statement from Bamako. The actions of the \nterrorists and drug traffickers, cloaked in a false veil of religion, \nreinforce the inevitability of military action.\u0014",

As soon as he receives it, he throws it in the waiter's face. \nThe waiter is ready to fight, but the man says, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I \nhave a horrible compulsion. I can't help it.

    "words": "Is It Stealing From God to Split Your Tithe Between the Church and \nOther Charities? \u0014\n\u0014\nThree views on what it means to give faithfully.\u0014\nGary Moore, Amie Streater, and Douglas LeBlanc 10/16/2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nCare for the Poor\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Moore is founder of the Financial Seminary and author of six \nstewardship books, including Look Up America!\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, but a nuanced \"no.\" Stewardship theologians have to be as \nbalanced as the economists about whom President Truman famously \ncomplained, saying he wanted a one-handed economist because his \neconomists' advice began \"On the one hand  on the other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the one hand, Jesus did immortalize the widow who gave her last \nmites in the temple. But on the other hand, that was more about her \namazing faith than her choice of beneficiary. Someone explained once \nto a gathering of stewardship officers that Jesus did not say to sell \nwhat we have and give it to the temple, or even for the gospel, but \nto the poor. Neither did Malachi say to bring the full tithes for the \noperation of the temple. The storehouse was for the needy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose ideas, though, are not often pointed out. The church is a \nmostly human institution, particularly when it comes to money, and \nhuman institutions, whether governmental, corporate, or \necclesiastical, can be quite self-centered. My friends John and \nSylvia Ronsvalle (\\emptytomb.org) have long studied how churches use \ndonations. The Ronsvalles have a passion for givingparticularly for \ngetting America's affluent churches to open their hands to those \naround our world in the greatest need. Their most recent report is \nnot encouraging for the Christlike faces of the poor, thirsty, and \nnaked.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report shows that congregational giving has not kept up with our \nrising incomes, and benevolent giving to the poor, including \ndenominational support, has suffered even more. I've been the board \npresident of two affluent mainline churches and discovered in both \nthat we spent more of our general budget on lawn care than true \nbenevolences. The Ronsvalles' studies likely affirm that anecdotal \nevidence. The eight evangelical denominations they studied gave more \nto the needy than did the mainline denominations, but even that was \ndue to a growing number of members.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, we should remember that many denominations have affiliated \nsocial service ministries. For example, my Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch in America is affiliated with Lutheran Social Services of \nAmerica. That could be the largest social ministry in the country if \nits various state agencies are combined, according to Forbes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany evangelicals give to charities like Habitat for Humanity. I \nexpect that is closer to Jesus' idea of giving to the house of the \nLord than the testimonies we often hear on pledge card Sundays.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's important to consider the role of the church in social welfare \nin our country. As Robert Schwarzwalder, senior vice president at the \nFamily Research Council, pointed out, the Jewish worship system \nprovided civil and administrative services for its communities, \nincluding systematically providing for the poor. The modern Christian \nchurch simply does not fill that statelike function on any regular \nbasis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it's largely a matter of rights and responsibilities. Should the \nchurch reassume more biblical responsibilities, it would be entitled \nto more of the biblical tithe. Until then, church leaders might \nreflect that giving to the poor can't be stealing from God when \nJesus, owner of all, pointedly said that what we do for the poor, we \ndo for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot Theft, But \u0014\n\u0014\nAmie Streater is associate pastor for financial stewardship at New \nLife Church in Colorado Springs and author of Your Money God's Way\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see: Word\\My Docucments\\Is It Stealing   (Poor \nexegesis but worth reviewing)\u0014",

    "title": "INTRODUCTION TO MARK",
    "words": "Mark, the earliest continuous narrative of Jesus' life known to have \nsurvived, depicts neither a \u0014\nmiraculous birth nor a glorious resurrection appearance, but rather \nleadership that derives from \u0014\nservice, power in suffering, and glory in death. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the healing of the blind man of Bethsaida (Mk 8.22-26) \nserves as a paradigm for \u0014\nthe Gospel. After his first ministrations, Jesus asks the man, \"Can \nyou see anything?\" The man \u0014\nresponds, \"I can see people, but they look like trees, walking.\" Only \nafter Jesus lays his hands \u0014\non the man a second time is clarity of vision achieved. In a similar \nmanner, Mark's Gospel neatly \u0014\ndivides .into two sections. The first eight chapters present a Jesus \nwho speaks in parables,  who \u0014\nuses the enigmatic self-designation \"Son of Man,\" who frequently \norders those aware of his \u0014\nidentity as Son of God or of his powers to heal to remain silent, and \nwho is misunderstood by \u0014\nhis Galilean community, his family, and even his disciples. Something \nmomentous is happening, \u0014\nbut the meaning of his person and mission is shrouded in secrecy and \nparable. \u0014\n\u0014\nClarity comes midway through the narrative. \"Immediately\" (one of the \nGospel's favorite \u0014\nwords) after the Bethsaida healing, Jesus asks his disciples about \nhis identity. Following Peter's \u0014\ninsight that Jesus is not John the Baptist, or Elijah, or one of the \nprophets but is in fact the \u0014\nmessiah (8.28-30), Jesus finally speaks \"quite openly\" (8.32): \"Then \nhe began to teach them \u0014\nthat the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by \nthe elders, the chief priests, \u0014\nand the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again\" \n(8.31). The remainder of the \u0014\nGospel, the \"passion narrative,\" details both the resistance to and \nthe fulfillment of this \u0014\nprediction. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeter rebukes Jesus; he and his fellow disciples cannot accept that \nthe Lord's anointed would \u0014\nsuffer and die. This failure of appropriate theology corresponds to \ntheir later failures in action: \u0014\nOne disciple betrays Jesus (14.17-21); three others are unable to \nsupport him in Gethsemane \u0014\n(14.28-50); all desert him at the arrest (14.50); and Peter denies \nhim (ch. 14). The women \u0014\nfollowers from Galilee (15.40-41) similarly fail in their intention \nto anoint his body (16.1), and \u0014\nthey flee from the tomb not to proclaim the resurrection but in \nsilence and in fear (16.8). But \u0014\nsome do recognize the meaning of Jesus' identity. The woman at the \nhouse of Simon the leper \u0014\nanoints his body for burial (14.8), and the centurion at the cross, \nupon seeing Jesus breathe his \u0014\nlast, proclaims, \"Truly this man was God's Son\" (15.39). \u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike the other canonicals Gospels, Mark records no resurrection \nappearances. The young \u0014\nman at the tomb reminds the women that Jesus had promised to return \nto his followers (16.7, \u0014\nsee 14.28), but the reconciliation recorded in Mt 16.20 is missing in \nthe earliest manuscripts of \u0014\nMark's Gospel. The early church added to Mark's original conclusion \nat 16.8 several resurrection \u0014\nappearances, but the Gospel may better be appreciated with its abrupt \nending. Like the two-stage healing in Bethsaida, Peter's incomplete \nrecognition of Jesus' identity, and even the cry of dereliction, \"My \nGod, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" which Jesus utters from the \ncross, there is a second part to the story, unrecounted but well \nknown to Mark's community. The blind man eventually sees; Peter will, \nas the other Gospels, Acts, and Paul's letters tell us, become an \napostles' of the early church; Psalm 22, with which Jesus' cry \nbegins, ends with a celebration of redemption. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe evangelist's decision to record the words and deeds of Jesus in \nnarrative form, as opposed \u0014\nto saying collections or miracle lists, and the emphasis on Jesus' \nvictory through suffering both \u0014\nsuggest the needs of the congregation to which the Gospel was \naddressed. For a community \u0014\nundergoing persecution, or struggling with delay of the return of the \n\"Son of Man,\" or facing \u0014\nalternative interpretations of Jesus' life and mission, the narrative \nprovides guidance: Followers \u0014\nof Jesus will suffer, as he did; the Son will come like a thief in \nthe night, so believers should \u0014\nremain steadfast and be prepared; Jesus is not some demi-god or \nmiracle worker to be confused \u0014\nwith or even compared to such figures as, respectively, Asclepius or \nApollonius of Tyana. He is \u0014\nthe one whose death ransoms many (10.45). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe identity of the author is not provided in the earliest \nmanuscripts, although the church \u0014\nfather Eusebius records a tradition that this Gospel was written by \n(John) Mark, Peter's com- \u0014\npanion (Acts 12, 15; 1 Pet 5.13). The narrative reveals the \nevangelist to be a Greek-speaking \u0014\nChristian, using the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the \nHebrew Scriptures and \u0014\nwriting for an audience to some extent unfamiliar with Jewish \npractices and with the Aramaic \u0014\nlanguage (5.41; 7.3-4, 34; 15.26). Both Rome and Alexandria are \nproposed in early sources as \u0014\nsites of composition; current research has also proposed Galilee or \nSouthern Syria. Whether the \u0014\nGospel indicates awareness of the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple \nin 70 CE is unclear. \u0014\nMark 13.2 predicts the fall of the Temple, but the statement could \nwell have been Jesus' own \u0014\nprediction.\u0014",

    "title": "INTRODUCTION TO MATTHEW",
    "words": "This Gospel, the favorite of the early church, offers a carefully \ncrafted account of Jesus' birth, \u0014\nmission, and passion. Beginning With a genealogy that anchors Jesus \nin Jewish history, the text \u0014\ndevelops the story of a messiah who faithfully upholds the Torah, \nfulfills prophecy, and \u0014\nestablishes the model of leadership through service. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel is neatly organized for teaching purposes. Following the \ninfancy accounts, bap- \u0014\ntism, and temptation, which securely connect Jesus to the scriptures \nof Israel, the evangelist \u0014\npresents five extended speeches interspersed with controversy \naccounts and healings. The best \u0014\nknown, the Sermon on the Mount (chs. 5-7) combines blessings and \nteachings to convey the \u0014\nradical nature of Jesus' message. The second discourse (ch. 10) \noffers missionary instructions as \u0014\nwell as warnings of the persecutions that will accompany proclamation \nof the good news. The \u0014\nparables collected in ch. 13 describe the kingdom of heaven as a time \nand a place of great joy, \u0014\nif only those with ears to hear can grasp the message. Rules for \necclesial organization comprise \u0014\nch. 18, and chs. 24-25 prophesy the apocalyptic consummation of \nhistory and the final \u0014\njudgment. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch literary artistry provides one of several hints that the \nevangelist was a scribe (see 13.52), \u0014\ncapable of combining traditional material into a coherent narrative. \nScribal training may also \u0014\naccount for the Gospel's extensive use of fulfillment citations: \nAlong with numerous allusions, \u0014\nMatthew directly quotes scripture forty times and offers several \nstatements, called \"fulfillment \u0014\ncitations\" or \"formula citations,\" which proclaim Jesus' \n\"fulfillment\" of a passage from scripture \u0014\n(2.17-18, 23; 4.14b-16; 8.17; 12.18-21; 13.35; 21.4-5; 27.9-10). \nFinally, perhaps scribal \u0014\ntraining underlies Matthew's depiction of Jesus as a new Moses: Both, \nas infants, escape a death \u0014\nordered by political leaders; both sojourn in Egypt; both give \ninstructions from a mountain; and \u0014\nboth face people not always receptive to their message. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew the emphasis on Jewish history, the use of the expression \n\"kingdom of heaven\" \u0014\nrather than \"kingdom of God\" (which marks Jewish avoidance of the \nsacred name), the preser- \u0014\nvation of the Laws of Torah, and the lack of explanation for Jewish \npractices such as ritual. \u0014\nwashing prior to eating all suggest a setting among Jews who \nproclaimed Jesus the messiah. \u0014\nPossibilities for the place of writing range from Syria to Galilee to \nthe Transjordan. Stressing \u0014\nTorah observance, the evangelist is unclear about the extent to which \nthe commandments (Heb., \u0014\n\"mitzvot\") should be followed by gentile believers in the church. In \npart, this lack of clarity \u0014\nresults from the Gospel's view of salvation-history: Before the \ncross, Jesus comes only to the \"lost \u0014\nsheep of the house of Israel\" 00.6; 15.24); in the Great Commission \nof 28.16-20, the mission \u0014\nis extended to \"all nations\" (28.19). \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the evangelist urges that Pharisaic teachings be followed \n(23.2), the Gospel also \u0014\nreflects, frequently through harsh polemic, the church's separation \nfrom the synagogue. \u0014\nWhether Matthew should be considered \"anti-Jewish\" remains an area of \ndebate. Scholars who \u0014\nview the evangelist as Jewish and still within the synagogue system \nfrequently classify the polem- \u0014\nical language as typical disputation between members of the same \ngroup. Others even propose\u0014\nthat Matthew's polemic has the same setting and effect as the \nexcoriations ofIsrael delivered by \u0014\nthe prophets.  Those who see the Gospel as reflecting a majority \ngentile audience and as having \u0014\nseparated from the synagogue are more likely to see the text as \nanti-Jewish. Regardless of its \u0014\nhistorical circumstances, the Gospel of Matthew, with its infamous \nline attributed to the Jeru- \u0014\nsalem crowd, \"His blood be on us and on our children\" (27.25), has \ntragically served as a-warrant \u0014\nfor violence against Jews. Given Matthew's insistence on higher \nrighteousness-\"righteousness\" \u0014\nis a key Matthean term-and love of neighbor, likely the evangelist \nwould be horrified by such \u0014\nactions taken in the Gospel's name.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with establishing its tense relationship to Jews who did not \naccept the gospel message, \u0014\nMatthew also reveals the Christian community's process of developing \nan internal identity. Of \u0014\nthe four canonical Gospels, Matthew's is the only one to use the term \n\"church\" (Gk.\"ekklesia\") \u0014\nand the only one to proclaim Peter the \"rock\" who holds the keys to \nthe kingdom. This concern \u0014\nfor institutional organization, coupled with the evangelist's use of \nsources, interest in the gentile \u0014\nmission, awareness of the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 \nCE (see Mt 22.7), and \u0014\nself-definition in relation to the synagogue, suggests a \ncompositional date sometime toward the \u0014\nend of the first century. Economically, the church may have been \ncomparatively well off. Only \u0014\nin Matthew is Joseph of Arimathea explicitly designated \"rich\" \n(27.57). Whereas Luke has Jesus \u0014\nannounce, \"Blessed are you who are poor\" and \"Blessed are you who are \nhungry now\" (Lk 6.20- \u0014\n21), the Sermon on the Mount proclaims, \"Blessed are the poor in \nspirit\" and \"Blessed are those \u0014\nwho hunger and thirst for righteousness\" (Mt 5.3, 6).\u0014",

    "title": "IS EVOLUTION A \"MUST WIN\" ISSUE?",
    "words": "by Url Scaramanga, Christianity Today 12/3/12\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the aftermath of the presidential election, many conservative \nRepublicans are doing some soul searching. Are they out of step with \nmost Americans? Have they been pulled too far to the right by their \nbase? And are the culture war issues that have kept evangelicals in \nlock-step with the GOP for the last 30 years now doing more harm then \ngood?\u0014\n\u0014\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, who is already testing the waters for a \nrun for the White House in 2016, recently did an interview with GQ \nwhere he was asked about the age of the earth. Rubio ducked and \ndodged and finally said, Im not a scientist, man. Mr. Rubios \nnon-answer puts him at odds with last years slate of Republican \ncandidates. Eager to win conservative Christian voters, many of them \nspoke openly about their distrust of evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nRick Perry made headlines when he called evolution a theory with \nsome gaps in it. Ron Paul was an outspoken creationist, as was Rick \nSantorum who garnered the early support of evangelical leaders. Mitt \nRomney, who ultimately became the Republican candidate, took a middle \nof the road stance saying he believed God created the universe, but \nhe also said, \"evolution is most likely the process he used to create \nthe human body.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Romney still won the evangelical vote by a wide margin \nindicates evolution/creationism does not determine the way most \nevangelicals vote. Still, Senator Rubios refusal to engage the \nquestion may be a sign that at least the science front of the culture \nwar may be winding down. Additional evidence came last week when Pat \nRobertson--who is no stranger to controversial statements--rejected \nthe idea of a young earth as well. \u0014\n\u0014\nKen Ham, the young earth creationist behind the Creation Museum near \nCincinnati, Ohio, slammed Robertson for his comments saying, \"Not \nonly do we have to work hard to not let our kids be led astray by the \nanti-God teaching of the secularists, we have to work hard to not let \nthem be led astray by compromising church leaders like Pat Robertson.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy are both Christian politicians and media figures abandoning \nevolution as an issue in the culture war? It may be too soon to say \nfor certain, but perhaps losing ground both politically and \nculturally is causing some Christians to be more discerning about \nwhich battles are really worth fighting. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Joshua Swamidass is a professor in the Laboratory and Genomic \nMedicine Division at Washington University in St. Louis. In a recent \ncolumn for The Wall Street Journal, Swamidass proposes that both \nRepublicans and evangelicals need to provide a more sensible position \non both evolution and science in general. He writes, Christians who \ntry to push their view of creation through political coercion are \nmisrepresenting their faith. The good news is how God saves us. Not \nhow he created us. And it is through persuasion rather than force \nthat he brings us to knowledge of Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do you think? Is evolution a battle that the church must fight, \nor is it a distraction from more essential truths?\u0014",

    "title": "ISAIAH 9 AND NEW TESTAMENT INTERPRETATION",
    "words": "Isaiah 9:2-7 in the Septuagint, New Testament, and\u0014\nPatristic Interpretation\u0014\n\u0014\nProphetic texts that seem obviously messianic\u0014\nand christological to contemporary readers have\u0014\nnot always been seen in the same way. The Septuagint\u0014\ntranslation shows surprising differences from the Hebrew\u0014\nhere. Among other things, references to war in vv. 4-5 are\u0014\nreplaced by references to economic injustice (for the rod\u0014\nof the tax collectors the Lord has broken as on the day\u0014\nagainst Midian, for each robe acquired by deceit and each\u0014\ngarment with profit they will repay . . .). Even more surprisingly,\u0014\nv. 6 reads and he is named angelos\u0014\n(messenger/angel) of great counsel, for I will bring peace\u0014\nto the princes, peace and health for him. Both of these\u0014\nadjustments have been thought to reflect the translators\u0014\nsensibilities, highlighting both the incomparability and the\u0014\npeaceful purposes of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the use by New Testament writers of the LXX\u0014\nwhen citing Scripture, and given the LXX reference to the\u0014\ncelebrated child as an angel, it becomes less surprising\u0014\nthat the only New Testament quotation of this hymn is\u0014\nthat of the first part of the passage in Matt 4:15-16. (See\u0014\n[Matthew 4:15-16].) In fact, the status of Jesus in relation\u0014\nto God was much debated, and as the book of\u0014\nHebrews attests (Heb 1:3-14), the notion of his being an\u0014\nangel held some currency in early Christianity, though it\u0014\nwas hotly contested. No first-century Christian text, scriptural\u0014\nor otherwise, that may have appealed to this LXX\u0014\ntext to describe the nature of Christ has survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 2d century, Justin appealed to this verse to\u0014\nassert Jesus role as a teacher: by calling him [Christ]\u0014\nthe Angel of great counsel, did not Isaiah predict that\u0014\nChrist would be a teacher of those truths that he\u0014\nexpounded when he came upon this earth? In his 4thcentury\u0014\ncommentary, Jerome theorized that the\u0014\nSeptuagint translator was terrified by the majesty of\u0014\nthese names, did not dare to say of a child that he must\u0014\nbe called God, and so substituted what seemed a more\u0014\npalatable translation. With Jesus in mind, Jerome translated\u0014\nthe first four words from the Hebrew as four\u0014\nseparate titles: wonderful, counselor, God, mighty. For\u0014\nmany centuries the two traditions, one derived from the\u0014\nGreek and the other from the Hebrew by way of Jeromes\u0014\nVulgate, coexisted side by side before the rendering with\u0014\nwhich we are more familiar took precedence.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohan Lust, Messianism in the Septuagint: Isaiah 8:23b9:6 (9:1-7), \nin\u0014\nInterpretation of the Bible (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, \n1998)\u0014\n14763.\u0014\nBrian McNeil, Quotation at John 12:34, NovT 19 (1977): 2233.\u0014",

    "words": "Farmer Joe was in a serious accident and decided to take the trucking \ncompany responsible for the accident to court. In court, the trucking \ncompany's lawyer was questioning farmer Joe. Didn't you say, at the \nscene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?, questioned the lawyer. \u0014\n\u0014\nFarmer Joe responded, Well I'll tell you what happened. I had just \nloaded my favourite mule Bessie into the . . . \u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't ask for any details, the lawyer interrupted, just answer \nthe question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm \nfine'! \u0014\n\u0014\nFarmer Joe said, Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I \nwas driving down the road . . . \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawyer interrupted again and said, Judge, I am trying to \nestablish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told \nthe Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several \nweeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he \nis a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer \nand said to the lawyer, I'd like to hear what he has to say about \nhis favorite mule Bessie. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoe thanked the Judge and proceeded, Well as I was saying, I had \njust loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was \ndriving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer \nran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was \nthrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was \nhurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear ole \nBessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by \nher groans. Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on \nthe scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over \nto her. After he looked at her he took out his gun and shot her \nbetween the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road with his \ngun in his hand and looked at me. He said, Your mule was in such bad \nshape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling? \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was then that I said, I'm fine. -- Stephen Sheane\u0014",

    "title": "IN TWO SEPARATE BUT RELATED GENRES",
    "words": "\u0014\nMicah 5:2-5a\u0014\n\u0014\nThis well-known text may be said to exist in two separate but related \ngenres, one in terms of its Jewish Older Testament context and the \nother in the Christian Newer Testament setting. It is first of all an \nIsraelite-Jewish text, one of many within what may be called the \n\"Messianic Problem\" grouping. These texts are concerned with the \nproblem of \"Whom will God raise up from among the descendants of \nDavid to become our new king who shall under God lead us to political \nindependence and freedom? Which of the descendents of the great king \nDavid shall give us the security that our ancestors enjoyed?\" Just as \nDavid had been born in Bethlehem, so also it was expected by many \nthat a son of David destined to become a political messiah would \nsomeday be born in that little village. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a most interesting way, the Jewish Messianic Problem of who would \nbe this great new king became the basis for what would later be seen \nas many Christian Messianic Prophecies pointing specifically to \nJesus. It is important that intelligent, educated Christians in our \ntime become aware of this basis for the so-called Christian Messianic \nProphecies of this type. The Matthean and the Lukan traditions \n\"solved\" the Jewish Messianic Problem to the satisfaction of the \nearly Church by placing the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem and turning \nthe Micah 5:1-5a Jewish Messianic Problem text into a Christian \nMessianic Prophecy that has remained basically unquestioned in \npopular Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristian Christmas carols such as \"O Little Town Of Bethlehem\" have \nbrought Micah 5:2-5a fully into our Christian Christmas setting. \nNevertheless, the little town (now city) of Bethlehem remains a holy \nplace for both Jews and Christians for separate but related reasons. \nWith greater understanding of the varied use of Micah 5:2-5a by both \nJews and Christians, the text and the town can and should become \nfocal points for fellowship and shared community between Jews and \nChristians, and for Muslims as well.\u0014",

    "words": "January 12, 2013  New York Times\u0014\nIndias New Focus on Rape Shows Only the Surface of Womens Perils\u0014\n\u0014\nBy GARDINER HARRIS\u0014\n\u0014\nNEW DELHI  Harassed for years by her husband and his relatives, an \nIndian woman was finally kidnapped, raped, strangled and tossed into \na ditch. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than a year, the womans father has tried without success to \nget the police to arrest those accused of killing her, including her \nhusband, who were charged but remain at large. The father, Subedar \nAkhileshar Kumar Singh, an army officer, says he believes his \ndaughter was killed because her in-laws were not satisfied with her \ndowry, according to an article on Thursday in The Indian Express. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch crimes are routine in this country, where researchers estimate \nthat anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 women a year are killed over \ndowry disputes. Many are burned alive in a particularly grisly form \nof retribution. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile a horrific gang rape in New Delhi has transfixed India and \ndrawn attention to a violent epidemic, rape is just one facet of a \nbroad range of violence and discrimination that leads to the deaths \nof almost two million women a year, researchers say. Among the causes \nare not only sexual violence but also domestic violence, family \ndisputes and female infanticide, as well as infant neglect and poor \ncare of the elderly that affect girls and women far more than boys \nand men. \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen have made enormous strides in India in recent decades. Their \nschooling now matches that of men, and they have moved forcefully \ninto many industries, although their participation in the work force \nis still far less than that of men. And women have become leaders in \nIndian politics. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut women in New Delhi and throughout India say that their gender \nmakes them vulnerable to attack from a vast and growing sea of \nunattached and unemployed young men who view womens success as the \nreason for their failure. \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are breaking through and advancing toward greater attainment  \nbut in a society that continues to be patriarchal, that is increasing \ntensions, said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health \nFoundation of India. And one of the manifestations of that tension \nis increased violence against women. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a column in The Hindustan Times, Sagarika Ghose, an author and \ncommentator, wrote, A profound fear and a deep, almost pathological, \nhatred of the woman who aspires to be anything more than mother and \nwife is justified on the grounds of tradition. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat tradition has for centuries been especially deadly for women who \nfail to live up to its ideals or reject them altogether. Using \ntechniques pioneered by Amartya Sen, an economist who won the Nobel \nPrize in 1998, researchers estimate that there are as many as 100 \nmillion missing women, as Mr. Sen called them, in India. These are \nwomen who would be alive if they died at the same rates relative to \nmen as woman die relative to men in more developed countries, and \ntheir ranks grow by nearly two million each year, studies by an \nAmerican and Canadian research team concluded. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of these lives are ended before they begin: Indian women are far \nmore likely to abort female fetuses than male ones. Still, such birth \nselection accounts for, at most, 12 percent of the figure, the \nresearchers found. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe official explanation for many of the deaths of missing women is \nthat they died from accidents or injuries, but there is little reason \nto believe that Indians are especially clumsy or accident-prone, the \nresearchers said. Instead, they believe that in many cases the \nofficial explanations mask deadly crimes. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur guess is that a lot of these deaths are due to the dowry \nphenomenon, but it just doesnt get reported that way, said Siwan \nAnderson, an associate professor of economics at the University of \nBritish Columbia and an author of the studies. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs many as 100,000 women are burned to death each year and another \n125,000 die from violent injuries that are rarely reported as \nkillings, according to government figures and other data analyzed by \nthe research team. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond violence, Indian girls may suffer from subtle neglect that can \nhave profound consequences. Research has found, for instance, that \nIndian mothers tend to breast-feed boys longer than they do girls, \nMs. Anderson said. And once their sons start eating solid food, they \nmay get more of it than their daughters. Families may also invest \nmore in the protection of boys health, buying them mosquito netting \nto ward off malaria and dengue. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese differences in nutrition and care may account for the \nsubstantially greater share of girls under the age of 4 who die of \ninfectious and respiratory diseases in India than elsewhere, the \nresearchers found. \u0014\n\u0014\nDeaths in childbirth, long considered a plague here, account for the \nfatalities of about 130,000 Indian women a year. An even greater \nnumber results from an increased relative risk of heart attacks, \nwhich may demonstrate that the poorer quality of care provided to \nwomen continues throughout their lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs girls age, the strict controls that many families have over their \ndaughters cannot protect them from rape and sexual assault, since \nmost of those crimes are committed by people known to the women, \nstudies say. But even so, such controls have some benefits, public \nhealth experts say. Indian women have, on average, no more than two \nsexual partners in their entire lives, and most are virgins when they \nmarry, surveys show. This absence of promiscuity is probably an \nimportant reason that AIDS never became an epidemic in India. \u0014\n\u0014\nTradition in this case is not a bad thing, said K. Sujatha Rao, a \nformer health secretary of India and a crucial figure in the fight \nagainst AIDS. You take marriage here as a much more sacrosanct \nthing. \u0014\n\u0014\nTrying to determine how to protect women in India while preserving \nthe countrys traditions has led to a very public debate in recent \nweeks. \u0014\n\u0014\nAsaram Bapu, a popular Hindu guru, said that the New Delhi rape \nvictim could have saved herself if she had simply held the hand of \none of the men and said, I consider you as my brother.  Some \nconservative politicians and commentators blamed skirts, revealing \nclothing, a lack of overcoats on girls, junk food, astrology and the \ndecisions by some wives to work outside the home. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor many Indian women, having more police officers on the streets is \nno answer, since many view them as every bit as dangerous to their \nsafety as criminals. On Thursday, the police in South Delhi put up \nposters advising young women to go straight home after their classes \nin school or college. \u0014\n\u0014\nTradition in India also results in considerable acceptance of \nviolence. A 2005 government survey found that 54 percent of women in \nIndia said that husbands were justified in beating their wives, with \nthe most common justification being if they failed to show proper \nrespect for their in-laws. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Indian husbands beat their wives far less than men in many \nother developing countries, according to comparable surveys done in \nmultiple countries. Domestic violence levels are far higher in \nColombia, Egypt, Peru and Zambia than in India, the surveys found. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut discrimination against women is so endemic and wide-ranging in \nIndia that deaths from domestic violence account for only a fraction \nof the overall risk of unnecessary death. Other aspects come into \nplay, like female infanticide, mistreatment of young girls in terms \nof access to resources, maternal deaths, unequal access to health \ncare and so forth, said Ms. Anderson, the economics professor. \nIndian women face more dangers.\u0014",

He was fascinated by their \nbrightness, and so he ran inside the house and excitedly asked his \ndad, Daddy, what makes the fireflies glow? \u0014\n\u0014\nHis dad, not sure how to answer, said to his son, I really dont \nknow, son. Why dont you ask your teacher at school? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy was not discouraged by his fathers non-answer but simply ran \noutside to admire the fascinating creatures some more. He tried to \ncatch one. Several times he swatted at them with his hands but \nmissed; but then his hands clapped together on both sides of ones \nflight and it squished between his palms. Making a face as he felt \nthe mashed insects body between his hands, he slowly opened them to \nsee the wasted creature. To his surprise the dead firefly was still \nglowing in the palms of his hands. \u0014\n\u0014\nExcitedly, he ran back into the house, yelling, Daddy, Daddy, I \nfound out what it is that makes the fireflies glow! \u0014\n\u0014\nHis dad, pleased that his son had figured out the answer to his own \nquestion, asked, And what is it, son?\u0014\n\u0014\nIts the stuff inside! he replied proudly, showing him the palm of \nhis hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Harris explained, The same thing is true of followers of Jesus \nChrist. What is it that gives us that glow? The answer is simple. \nIts the stuff inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Nelson.\u0014",

    "words": "There are all sorts of helpful lights in the world. We can be \nilluminated by them without letting them extinguish the light of the \nSpirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nFireflies. They are a fond memory many of us have from warm summer \nevenings in childhood. Their cheery glow drew our attention, and some \nof us even captured a few of these tiny creatures in a jar. Whether \nwe called them fireflies, lightning bugs or glowworms, we saw their \ntiny lights as one of the marks of summertime.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo now let me ask you, when did you last see a bunch of fireflies? \nYou probably havent thought about that before, but now that you do, \nchances are your answer is something like Its been a long time or \nI cant remember when. \u0014\n\u0014\nThats not because youve become less observant. While theres no way \nto tag and count insect populations, experts think that fireflies are \ndwindling, perhaps by as much as 70 percent in recent years, and lots \nof anecdotal evidence supports that claim  so much so that more than \n100 entomologists and biologists gathered in Thailand last summer for \nan international symposium on the Diversity and Conservation of \nFireflies.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne bit of anecdotal evidence comes from Preecha Jiabyu, a man in \nThailand who used to take tourists by rowboat on the Mae Klong River \nexpressly to see the riverbanks aglow with fireflies. Now, however, \nthe only lights he sees from the river are the fluorescent ones from \nhotels and restaurants. These days, he has to row more than two miles \nfrom the city to see any lightning bugs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the same thing appears to be happening on other continents as \nwell. Researchers in places as diverse as Switzerland and the United \nStates have made similar observations. A woman who spent 10 years \nstudying fireflies on her farm in Knoxville, Tennessee, finally gave \nup on one species of the glowing insects because she stopped seeing \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres probably no single factor to blame, but likely causes include \nurban sprawl and industrial pollution that obliterate the insects \nhabitat. Another probable cause  and this one surprised us  is the \nspread of artificial light. The glowing fireflies we do see are the \nmales of the species, who use their flashing lights to attract the \nfemales. (The females spend most of their time on the ground and \ndont flash.) Researchers suspect that so much artificial light \naround is interfering with the mating ritual, and thus they are not \nreproducing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause insect populations are all but impossible to count and so \nlittle money is available to fund studies, experts are turning to \nvolunteers to report changes in firefly populations. There are now \nsites on the Internet where you can report your observations.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers acknowledge that the concern over fireflies may not seem \nas urgent as that over some other dwindling species, such as polar \nbears and tigers, but they see the fate of these tiny light-bearers \nas a harbinger of unhealthy changes in the whole ecosystem.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemembering their cheery lights from warm summer evenings in our \nchildhood, we hope they will still be around for subsequent \ngenerations to enjoy.\u0014",

Rather, the \nproblem \"runs right through the pages of Scripture itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent Patheos blog post, Seibert writes that the Bible \"has \nbeen used to justify warfare, oppress women, condemn gays and \nlesbians, support slavery, and legitimate colonization, to name just \na few of its troubling legacies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's an old discussion, and Seibert notes that \"Most Christians would \nattribute this misuse of the Bible to faulty interpretations and \nmisguided interpreters.\" But that's not the only problem, he says. \n\"At times the Bible endorses values we should reject, praises acts we \nmust condemn, and portrays God in ways we cannot accept.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result, he argues, Christians have a moral obligation to \ncritique Scripture and condemn what is immoral,\" he states.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeibert's claims about the nature of Scripture are rare among \nprofessors at evangelical colleges, albeit not entirely new; the call \nfor Christians to pursue an 'ethical' reading of Scripture has long \nbeen a fixture in some mainline circles. But the sentiment seems to \nbe new in the Bible department of Messiah, one of the few Anabaptist \ncolleges in the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. \nStill, according to the school's statement of faith, \"God gives us \nthe Bible as the inspired, trustworthy and authoritative Scripture to \nreveal God's ways and purposes, to nourish our minds and souls, and \nto instruct us in how we ought to think and to live.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeibert has made similar claims before, most notably in his book \nDisturbing Divine Behaviorwhich also received criticism.

    "title": "ISSUES PASTORS MUST DISCUSS WITH SEARCH COMMITTEES",
    "words": "Issues Pastors Must Discuss with Search Committees\u0014\nby  Calvin Wittman on Thursday, March 01, 2007 \u0014\n\u0014\nAn essential skill every pastor should have is the ability to \nsuccessfully interact with a pastor search committee. Here are some \nimportant issues you need to discuss in these situations.\u0014\n\u0014\nCulture\u0014\n\u0014\nThe power of culture should never be underestimated. Every church, to \nsome degree, reflects the culture in which it is located. Oftentimes \nthe personalities which comprise the search committee will reflect \nthe culture of the church. Ask as many questions as necessary to \ndetermine the culture of the church that is interviewing you.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing where a church has been will help you understand where it is \nand why it is there, which will help you formulate a strategy to get \nit where it needs to go. Don't be afraid to investigate a church's \npast. It will reveal more than you may expect about its future.\u0014\n\u0014\nEducational\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the church looking for in a pastor? Do they want someone who \nwill maintain the status quo or someone who will lead them to the \nnext level? Churches will often look for a new pastor who possesses \nthe qualities they thought their last pastor lacked. If you go there \nexpecting one thing and they expecting another, you're in for \ntrouble. Know their expectations as well as your own.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrevious pastors\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing how the last few pastors fared will give you an idea of how \nyou will fare. Does the church have a history of loving or of \nmistreating its pastors? They will probably treat you like they have \ntreated the last few pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheology\u0014\n\u0014\nDo they believe the same things you believe? You can no longer take \nthis for granted. Look at their church covenant and their doctrinal \nstatement. Ask what curricula they use for Sunday school, Bible \nstudies, and other educational programs. If possible, listen to some \nof the most recent sermons on their church website - both from former \npastors and visiting preachers. Make sure you are theologically \nequally yoked.\u0014\n\u0014\nStaff\u0014\n\u0014\nWho hires and fires the staff? Who is responsible for them? If the \npastor is responsible for them but does not have authority to dismiss \nthem, this could lead to problems. Make sure you read the bylaws and \nunderstand the church's organizational structure. \u0014\n\u0014\nCompensation\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing wrong with discussing money, but this needs to be \ndone at the appropriate time. Normally the committee should be the \nfirst to broach the subject. When they ask you what you need, don't \nsell yourself short. Don't be greedy but do be honest.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolity\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is their form of church governance? Is it something you can live \nwith? Don't go in thinking you will change it. Far too many pastors \nlack integrity in this area. Be up-front about your preferences in \npolity.\u0014\n\u0014\nPriorities\u0014\n\u0014\nAre the church's priorities aligned with yours? Are they aligned with \nGod's? Make sure you and the church have a passion for the same \nthings. Mismatched priorities in any relationship always lead to \nconflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nVision\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does the committee view the church's future? What do they think \nit will look like in five or 10 years? Knowing this will help you \nunderstand where they are willing to be led and where they do not \nwant to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, to make sure there is mutual understanding, get things in \nwriting. Before you go in view of a call, write down everything you \nthought was agreed upon and put it in a \"memo of understanding.\" Send \nit back to the search committee and ask them to change anything they \nunderstood to be different and then to sign the final copy and return \nit to you. Since lay leadership will change during your tenure, it is \nalways good to have a written understanding of what was agreed to \nwhen you were called.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember, the time to ask questions is before you go.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Calvin Wittman is pastor of Applewood Baptist Church, Wheat \nRidge, Colorado. He serves as a trustee at Criswell College, and \nregularly contributes to Open Windows, a monthly LifeWay devotional \npublication.\u0014",

    "words": "For Some Women, the Misery of Mumbais Dance Bars Looks Like a Big \nStep Up\u0014\n\u0014\nBeautiful Thing by Sonia Faleiro\u0014\nBy DWIGHT GARNER        Published: February 29, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nBEAUTIFUL THING\u0014\n\u0014\nInside the Secret World of Bombays Dance Bars\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Sonia Faleiro\u0014\n\u0014\nNineteen when Ms. Faleiro met her, Leela was the highest paid bar \ndancer in a seedy Mumbai club called Night Lovers. She wore an \nimported-padded bra and had butterscotch streaks in her long hair; \nshe sneered at most of the men who paid to watch her. When theyd \ntoss small denomination rupee notes, shed mock them: Is this all \nyou think Im worth? Why shouldnt I commit suicide? Why shouldnt I \nstick my head into an oven? \u0014\n\u0014\nLeelas way with a dirty phrase seems to infect Ms. Faleiro, a gifted \nyoung Indian-born writer who is previously the author of a novel \ncalled The Girl (2006). Her language, like dots of colored light \npinging from a smudgy mirrored ball, casts an intoxicating if \nunsettling glow. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout one aggressive man at Night Lovers, the author observes: \nLeelas customer stank of vodka-chicken-onion-chili-lemon and \nclearly he was no hi-fi-super-badiya-tiptop type. He had no \nupbringing. Plenty of Ms. Faleiros best sentences are unpublishable \ntoo. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeautiful Thing is a book about Mumbais notorious sex industry, \nand the news it brings about young womens lives will break your \nheart several times over. Most are from small villages. Most were \nraped repeatedly when young, often by relatives. Many were sold to \nother men. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeela ran away to Mumbai when she was 13, after her father tried to \nfilm her nude and in suggestive poses, hoping she could be a porn \nactress. When she protested, he had her arrested, and she was raped \nby policemen. She fled from the general horror inflicted on Indias \npoor young women, in search of a better life. \u0014\n\u0014\nDancing at Night Lovers was, socially and financially, a step up for \nher. Bar dancers ranked above other sex workers, Ms. Faleiro \nexplains, because selling sex wasnt a bar dancers primary \noccupation and because when she did sell sex she did so quietly and \nmost often under her own covers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Leela wants, Leela rarely gets. She dreams of a Bollywood \ncareer, and of a good marriage. Shes forced instead to live by her \ntaut body and her even-more-taut wits. She squeezed the men in her \nlife like they were lemons, Ms. Faleiro writes, and once she was \nthrough, she discarded them like rinds. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeela is aware of the limited but genuine power she wields. They \nthink I dance for them, she declares of her customers. But really, \nthey dance for me. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Faleiros book has a resonance that belies its compact size. She \nfocuses on only a few characters: Leela, some of her dancer friends \nand Shetty, the wily owner of Night Lovers. If Beautiful Thing were \nto be made into a film, Shetty would be played by whomever is the \ncurrent Bollywood equivalent of Paul Giamatti. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith a few strokes Ms. Faleiro conjures a world, and it is mostly a \nworld of hurt and confusion. She spent five years researching and \nwriting this book, and its lessons are presented frankly. Poverty \neventually made criminals of everyone, she writes of the women and \nthe shady men in their milieu. Noting Mumbais unforgiving nature, \nshe says, Navet was fair prey and beauty unguarded deserved what \nit got. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn another writers hands Leelas story might have become an op-ed \ntract. But Ms. Faleiros book is not a dirge. For one thing Leela is \nsimply too quirky and alive on the page. She might be wealthy from \nthe tips she makes, but the author catches her in unguarded moments. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe loved not paying for her pleasures, Ms. Faleiro writes. After \nthe dance bar closed for the night, Leela would waltz from table to \ntable helping herself to half-smoked cigarettes. She would press her \ncherry-red lips to abandoned beer bottles. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres a feminist spark in Ms. Faleiros portrayal of these women. \nOne who was raped repeatedly before the age of 10 says to her, I \ndecided that if this was going to keep happening to me, then at least \nI should profit from it, I should eat from it. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeela urges the author not to pity her. When you look at my life, \ndont look at it beside yours, she implores. Look at it beside the \nlife of my mother and her mother and my sisters-in-law who have to \ntake permission to walk down the road. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis story cant end well, and of course it does not. The dance club \ncloses; Leela vanishes into prostitution while the author searches \nfor her. Ultimately Leela loses a tooth in a beating, and she and a \nfriend leave to work in Dubai at the urging of a gangster. You hate \nto think where she is at this moment. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis book, by its end, seems to have taken something out of Ms. \nFaleiro. You get the sense shed like to close with even a hint of \noptimism, but thats hard to muster. Instead she quotes the gangster, \nSharma, who explains that Leela will probably someday preside over a \nsmall brothel herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nSharma issues a line that will ring in your ears. She will sell her \ndaughter, even if she is her only child, her only family, because her \nmother sold her, and who is her daughter to deserve better? \u0014\n\u0014\nLeela, were she to read Beautiful Thing, would probably spark up a \ncigarette and tell us where to stuff our horror and pity. Shed agree \nwith the dancers who declared, within the authors earshot, Tears \nare the indulgences of those who havent suffered enough.\u0014",

Make certain you are \nclear that you know fully all the details of the churchs doctrine, \neven if you are in the same denomination. And be clear and truthful \nwith the theological beliefs you will bring to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAm I the right type of leader for this congregation? Almost all \nchurch members will say they desire to reach others. But not all are \nwilling to accept the necessary changes that must take place to do \nso. The ideal leader stays out front sufficiently so others will \nfollow; but he is not so far out front that his followers mistake him \nfor the enemy and shoot him in the rear.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill I have a passion for the community? The pastor must not only \nlove the church; he must also love the community where the church is \nlocated. Are you certain you can love the community sacrificially and \nwholeheartedly?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the true expectations of me? Most churches have a generic \njob description for the pastor. It would fit almost any church. \nInstead of depending on a job description, ask members what their \nfavorite pastor did to make him their favorite. You will then get a \ngood idea of what they really want you to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the expectations of church members? Is the church a high \nexpectation church or a low expectation church? Will I really be able \nto equip the saints to do the work of ministry, or will I be expected \nto do the bulk of the ministry myself?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the issues of conflict the church has experienced in recent \nyears? How are those issues affecting the church today? Are there \nsome unresolved and lingering issues? What are the expectations of me \nin dealing with unresolved conflicts?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the members greatest memories in this church? As members \nbegin to describe the perceived best days of the church, you will \nbegin to get a good idea of whats really important to them. You will \nthen have a more realistic view of your beginning point in the church.\u0014",

Thinking that everything could be OK again \nafter the four messages I received from you via the telephone and \nwhat you said I will never forget or will I ever forgive. I ask you \nnot to do what you did when you were 50 or however old you are. I \nnever have forgotten that you wanted to come and live with me and \nthen the way you went back to California when you were 15 and when I \ncalled you you made fun of me with some of your friends in the \nbackground. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou have hurt me for the last time.

In the Fourth Gospel she also sees and \nclings to the resurrected Jesus. Our understanding of the nuances of \nGreek grammar help us to see that it was not the intention of the \nwriter of the John 20:11-18 account to say that Mary Magdalene did \nnot touch the Risen Christ. The negative with the Greek present tense \nimperative mood in the word of the Risen Christ to her in John 20:17 \nindicates that the action described should not continue indefinitely, \nnot that it should not begin. Therefore, the words of the Risen \nChrist to Mary Magdalene should be translated into English as Do not \ncontinue any longer to hold me, not as Do not touch me! The latter \nwould have been indicated by using the negative with the Greek aorist \ntense subjunctive mood. When she could no longer cling to the Risen \nChrist, she went to his disciples to make her glorious Easter \nconfession of faith, I have seen the Lord!\u0014",

    "words": "A seminary professor was vacationing with his wife in Gatlinburg, \nTennessee .\u0014\n\u0014\nOne morning, they were eating breakfast at a\u0014\nlittle restaurant, hoping to enjoy a quiet, family meal.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile they were waiting for their food, they\u0014\nnoticed a distinguished looking, white-haired\u0014\nman moving from table to table, visiting with the guests.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor leaned over and whispered to his\u0014\nwife, I hope he doesn't come over here. But\u0014\nsure enough, the man did come over to their table.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere are you folks from? he asked in a friendly voice.\u0014\nOklahoma, they answered. Great to have you here in Tennessee,\u0014\nthe stranger said... What do you do for a living? I teach at a \nseminary, he replied. \u0014\n\u0014\nOh, so you teach preachers how to preach,\u0014\ndo you? Well, I've got a really great story for you. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd with that, the gentleman pulled up a chair\u0014\nand sat down at the table with the couple. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor groaned and thought to himself,\u0014\nGreat.. Just what we need.... Another preacher story!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man started, See that mountain over there? \u0014\n(Pointing out the restaurant window). Not far from the base of that \nmountain, \u0014\nthere was a boy born to an unwed mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had a hard time growing up, because every place he went, he was \nalways asked the same question,\u0014\n'Hey boy, who's your daddy?'\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether he was at school, in the grocery store or drug store, people \nwould ask the same question, \u0014\n'Who's your daddy?'\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would hide at recess and lunch time from other students. \u0014\nHe would avoid going into stores because that question hurt him so \nbad.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was about 12 years old, a new preacher came to his church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would always go in late and slip out early to avoid hearing the \nquestion,\u0014\n'Who's your daddy?'\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one day, the new preacher said the benediction so fast that he \ngot caught\u0014\nand had to walk out with the crowd. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust about the time he got to the back door, the new preacher, not \nknowing anything about him, \u0014\nput his hand on his shoulder and asked him, 'Son, who's Your daddy?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe whole church got deathly quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could feel every eye in the church was looking at him. \u0014\nNow everyone would finally know the answer to the question,\u0014\n'Who's your daddy?'\u0014\n\u0014\nThis new preacher, though, sensed the situation around him and using \ndiscernment that only the Holy Spirit could give,\u0014\nsaid the following to that scared little boy..\u0014\n\u0014\n'Wait a minute! I know who you are! I see the family resemblance now. \nYou are a child of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith that he patted the boy on his shoulder and said,\u0014\n'Boy, you've got a great inheritance.. Go and claim it.'\u0014\n\u0014\nWith that, the boy smiled for the first time in a long time and \nwalked out the door a changed person.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was never the same again. Whenever anybody asked him,\u0014\n'Who's your Daddy?' he'd just tell them, 'I'm a Child of God'''\u0014\n\u0014\nThe distinguished gentleman got up from the table and said, Isn't \nthat a great story?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor responded that it really was a great story!\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the man turned to leave, he said,\u0014\nYou know, if that new preacher hadn't told me that I was one of \nGod's children, \u0014\n I probably never would have amounted to anything!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he walked away..\u0014\n\u0014\nThe seminary professor and his wife were stunned. \u0014\nHe called the waitress over and asked her, \"Do you know who that man \nwas -- the one who just left that was sitting at our table?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe waitress grinned and said, Of course.

I \ncertainly didn't mind the wayfarers using the telephone.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, while I don't place a lot of stock in the value of my own \nlife, with my wife and four innocents in the house, I was hesitant to \nlet strangers inside on my family's account.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue of compassion fatigue came with the regular request for \nfuel.\u0014\n\u0014\nI normally didn't go out at night with complete strangers to put fuel \nin their vehicles.\u0014\n\u0014\nRather, I would just hand them the fuel and container I kept for the \nlawnmower in the garage, asking them to simply return the empty \ncontainer to my front porch when they were through with it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey would all promise to do so, but I regularly had to purchase new \nfuel containers. At one point, there had been a string of unreturned \ncontainers when the doorbell rang in the middle of a Saturday night \njust before Easter.\u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to the unfortunate's request, I got the fuel and \ncontainer, again asking that he return the container to the porch \nonce he got his automobile started.\u0014\n\u0014\nGushing in appreciation, he assured me that he would return the \ncontainer later that night and that it would be filled with gasoline. \nI internally rolled my eyes and whispered a silent goodbye to my \nhalf-filled container and its contents.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I arose the next morning, I stepped out to get the newspaper and \nto drink in the early signs of spring. I had no expectation of seeing \nmy container, and yet, there it was. I was surprised and a little \nashamed at my cynicism.\u0014\n\u0014\nI reached for the presumably empty container, and was doubly shocked \nthat it was filled. Ouch! The filled container meant my prejudice had \nbeen challenged twice by someone I had never seen and would probably \nnever see again.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill unconvinced that my good fortune could be that good, I had the \nnaked and suspicious audacity to remove the container's cap and sniff \nits contents to make sure it wasn't water.

Someday when my children are old enough to understand the logic \nand motivation of a mother, I'll tell them: I loved you enough to bug \nyou about where you were going and what time you would get home. I \nloved you enough to let you discover your friend was a creep. I loved \nyou enough to stand over you for two hours while you cleaned your \nbedroom, a job that would have taken me 15 minutes. I loved you \nenough to ignore what every other mother did or said. I loved you \nenough to let you stumble, fall, hurt and fail. I loved you enough to \naccept you for what you are, not what I wanted you to be. Most of \nall, I loved you enough to say no when you hated me for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome mothers don't know when their job is finished. They figure the \nlonger the kids hang around, the better parents they are. \u0014\n\u0014\nI see children as kites. You spend a lifetime trying to get them off \nthe ground. You run with them until you're both breathless...they \ncrash...you add a longer tail.

With each twist of the ball of twine, the kite \nbecomes more distant.

    "words": "About a year ago, Gloria and I were having a discussion on \nChristianity and grace. Here is something she wrote that I thought \nyou would find interesting. It pertains to the subject of self \njudgement from the actions of others and the desire to please a \nparent. I am glad this is not an issue for me. (John Skaggs)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe the experiences of this past year have brought some clarity to \nprior life experiences, one area anyway... \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe the vastness and totality of my God is so much more than \none person can even begin to comprehend. Maybe that is why we each \nhave different lessons to learn in this life here on earth. Maybe the \ntotality of our collective knowledge acquired will be understood at a \nlater date, but maybe not. I have to be okay with that, this is faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of two, my parents divorced. At the age of four, my Father \ndisappeared. Not really, but that was my perception and after all, is \nnot my perception, my reality? How could this happen? How could a \nfather deny his own child, turn his back on me, not love me? There \nwas only one answer, I was not good enough to be loved. Maybe if Ihad \nbeen a better little girl, he would have loved me, he wouldn't have \nleft. Maybe if I strive to become a better little girl, he will love \nme. But what I have come to know is, maybe not.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Mother remarried and though I know the Father who adopted me, \nloved me, I was never good enough for him either. No matter what I \ndid, I could have tried harder, I could have been better, I should \nnot have made mistakes. So it didn't feel like what I thought love \nwas supposed to feel like. It still felt conditional! Maybe, if I had \ntried harder, if I had been better, if I hadn't made mistakes, I \ncould have felt what love from a father is supposed to feel like. \nBut, maybe not!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my mind, the one I have been given, the way for me to know \nsomething is to understand it. For me to gain an understanding of \nsomething, I relate it to something I already know. And so it was, \nwhen trying to understand the love of my Heavenly Father. Maybe I \ncould be good enough for His love, but maybe not!\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough many painful and many joyful experiences, I have finally \nlearned that love has nothing to do with works. Yes, it is true that \nwe may come to love someone because of something they have done or \nsomeone comes to love us because of something we have done, but that \nis merely an introduction to love. Love, in it's complex and \nbeautiful wholeness, like God, is so much more than our mere mortal \nminds can conceive of. And while I cannot possibly perceive the depth \nof God's love for me, I do know it! I cannot earn His love. He will \nneither love me more or less according to my works. Maybe there will \nbe rewards and blessings for works, but maybe not! Maybe there will \nbe penalties and suffering because of my actions, but maybe not! \nNever the less, this is not how nor why God loves me. This is grace!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGloria Dale (Guthrie, Oklahoma)\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Gloria Dale (5/14/13) to John M. Skaggs\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Seriously, your Dad has been such an influence in my life. Though \nour contact with each other has not been all that great in the realm \nof quantity, I often refer back to his comments, ideas and thoughts \nhe has shared directly or indirectly when I am questioning, looking \nfor guidance and/or answers.

I asked him why it was so horrible for a woman to sit at \nthe front of the bus. I was really angry.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nRosenblit's Rosa Parks-like confrontation helped reveal the fault \nline between mainstream Israel and the insular ultra-Orthodox, or \nHaredi, minority in a way not seen in years.\u0014\n\u0014\nCulture clashes over Sabbath observance rules have been commonplace \nfor decades. But reports of the creeping exclusion of women from \npublic places has touched a raw nerve in the Jewish state by raising \nthe prospect of an Israel dominated by a religious extremism similar \nto hard-line ideologies prevalent in neighboring Muslim states. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt also has added to fears that Israel's much-touted democracy and \nits underpinnings of individual rights and equality are under threat.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"This is an important moment for Israel. The good news is that both \nthe public and the political system are responding with the \nappropriate outrage,\" says Yossi Klein Halevi, a fellow at the Shalom \nHartman Institute in Jerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"One of the responsibilities that have been forced on the state of \nIsrael because of its regional location, and its location in the Holy \nLand, is to be a force against religious fundamentalism. That's true \nin Israel's frontline role against jihadism, and it's true as well \nfor maintaining an open society in one of the most religiously \nintense countries in the world.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe culture clash is being heightened by some stark demographic \ntrends: \u0014\nThanks to high birthrates, the percentage of ultra-Orthodox in the \nadult Israeli population has doubled to 8 percent over the past 20 \nyears. In another 50 years, they will make up nearly a third of the \npopulation, according to government statistics. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with the newfound political and economic clout, ultra-Orthodox \nJews are gradually moving from the margins of society into mainstream \njobs, neighborhoods, and organizations like the army.\u0014",

    "title": "IS CHRISTMAS PAGAN?",
    "words": "Is Christmas Pagan? \u0014\n\u0014\nLong before Constantine, Christians found ways to redeem local \ncultures and salvage \u0014\nthose elements that naturally pointed to Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nWas the event we now call Christmas originally a \"pagan holiday\"? In \nsome ways. \u0014\nDoes that mean the church should discard it, along with its lights, \ntinsel, and increasing \u0014\ncommercialism? Only if we are prepared to abandon many other holidays \nand common \u0014\nChristian practices that the early church co-opted for its own \npurpose of glorifying \u0014\nChrist. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas has its origins in the fourth century. December 25, which \nChristians now \u0014\nherald as Jesus' birthday, was actually the date on which the Romans \ncelebrated the \u0014\nbirth of the sungod.  \u0014\n \u0014\nAfter the Roman emperor Constantine converted to Christianity at the \nMilvian \u0014\nBridge in 312, he sought to combine the worship of the sun god with \nthe worship of Christ. \u0014\nChristian leaders acceted Constantine's conversion in a positive \nlight and saw the \"Christ-mass\"\u0014\ncelebration as a vital part of the process of converting the pagan \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong before Constantine, Christians found ways to redeem local \ncultures and salvage \u0014\nelements in those cultures that naturally pointed to Christ, whether \nHebrew, Syrian, \u0014\nGreek, or Roman. They denounced inhumane pagan practices, but at the \nsame time took_\u0014\nover pagan temples and converted them to churches. They replaced the \nold gods in popular devotion with heroic martyrs of the persecutions. \nAnd they replaced the holy days of paganism with\t. \u0014\nwith festivals of the Christian year.\u0014\n \t\u0014\nLarger questions loom behind the observance of Christmas: Why a \nchurch calendar at a1l? \u0014\nWhy a Sunday? Why an Easter? Is there New Testament, authority for \nreligious holidays?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christmas, Easter, and Sunday all indicate, the Christian calendar \nis based upon the major events of the New Testament. Early Christians \nshared a conviction that believers need regular reminders\u0014\nof the  great events of redemptive history. Didn't Jesus himself \nendorse the practice when he \u0014\ninstituted the Lord's Supper? \"This do in remembrance of me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides, our celebration of Christmas or any other Christian \"holy \nday\" goes much deeper \u0014\nthan the date on which we observe it. The first Christmas celebration \ndid not commorate a \u0014\ndate at all but a supremely important event--the appearance of \nIsrael's promised Messiah and \u0014\nLord of the Nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Christians did not know the specific night the angels sang or \nthe baby cried any more than we do. A few believers tried to \ncalculate the date, but most of these indulged in all sorts of \nspeculations and differed with each other. As a result, down to the \nfirst half of the fourth century the churches attached no greater \nsignificance to December 25 than to many other dates.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis much we know: Before there was December 25, there was January 6. \nAs early as the second century Christians celebrated Jesus' \nappearance at the Jordan and his baptism by John on January 6. Some \ntime later they expanded this festival to include Christ's appearance \nat birth. Christians called it Epiphany, or manifestation. So the \nmeaning of the first Christmas was not pagan; it was a celebration of \nthe Word manifest in flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important to note that the link between Christ and \nConstantine's sun god was light. \u0014\n For generations, Christians had been singing about Christ's \nappearance as the true Light, as the light of Creation and \nredemption. Christians in these early centuries were \u0014\nfascinated by the image of light breaking into our darknes. We have \nseen a sign from\u0014\nheaven, the shining star,\" the choir sings in one early liturgy. \nAnother hymn announces:\u0014\n\u0014\n            The whole creation proclaims, \u0014\n            The Magi proclaim,  \u0014\n            The star proclaims:  \u0014\n            Behold! the king's son is here!\u0014\n\u0014\nThis impulse to sing the praises of Christ's birth did not come from \npaganism. It was a \u0014\nresult of Christians reflecting on the fact that God became man in \nJesus Christ and \u0014\ncondescended to our lowly estate. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany in the fourth-century church viewed Constantine's conversion as \nthe fulfillment of \u0014\nMalachi's prophecy: In the day of the Lord, the \"Sun of Righteousness \nwill arise with \u0014\nhealing in his wings\" for those who fear the Lord's name (4:2).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a Christmas sermon, Bishop Ambrose in Milan spoke for many \nChristians of that day \u0014\nwhen he said, \"Well do Christian people call this holy day, on which \nour Lord was born, \u0014\nthe day of the new sun; and they assert it so insistently that even \nJews and pagans agree \u0014\nwith them in using that name for it. We are happy to accept and \nmaintain this view, \u0014\nbecause with the day spring of the Savior, not only is the salvation \nof man kind renewed, \u0014\nbut also the splendor of the sun .... For if the sun withdrew its \nlight when Christ suffered, it \u0014\nmust shine at his birth with greater splendor than ever before. \" \u0014\nBy Bruce L Shelley, senior professor of church history \u0014\nat Denver Seminary.\u0014",

    "words": "Is Fatherhood Fading Out?\u0014\nA Christian response to the boom in absent dads.\u0014\nAlexandra Kuykendall \u0014\n6/14/2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a girl, Father's Day underscored  the other 364 days of the year, \nbringing a blaring reminder there was no father around to celebrate. \nThe absence of that single, critical male relationship didn't just \nmake me feel lonely and left out, it impacted my understanding of the \nworld and my place in it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter reflecting on how my father's absence has impacted me as a girl \nand now woman, wife and mother in my memoir, The Artist's Daughter, \nothers have shared with me similar stories of abandonment and \nstruggle. Our collective stories confirm what statistics scream: that \nthe bond from father to child is essential. Whether our dads were \ngood, bad, or not there at all, this relationship shapes our \nunderstanding of our very identities.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, we live in a country where too many of us have broken \nrelationships with Dad. In America, 1 in 3 kids live apart from their \nbiological fathers. A recent Washington Post article addressed the \ndad dilemma with the eye-catching title: The new F-Word  Father. In \nit, Kathleen Parker addresses a question being asked as we discuss \nthe latest stats on America's female breadwinners: In the evolving \n21st-century economy, \"what are men good for?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nParker concludes:\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen have become more self-sufficient (a good thing) and, given that \nthey still do the lion's share of housework and child rearing, why, \nreally, should they invite a man to the clutter? Because, simply, \nchildren need a father . Deep in the marrow of every human child \nburbles a question far more profound than those currently occupying \ncoffee klatches: Who is my daddy? And sadly these days, where is he?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile single mothers may have enough grit, love, and know-how to \nraise us, the absence of Dad will still have its effect. Study after \nstudy shows that a children with absent fathers are more likely to \nlive in poverty, drop out of high school, have a failing marriage, \neven be incarcerated than those whose fathers are involved in their \nlives. The data confirms how much a father matters to a child's \nphysical and emotional wellbeing and development. Fatherhood, it \nturns out, is a social justice issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that's unfortunately where the church often ends the \nconversation. We lament the shift in the family structure, express \noutrage at the latest statistics. We bring absent fathers into the \nculture wars, wrapping them up with changing definitions of marriage \nand family. As we preach and debate, Father's Days go by and millions \nof children remain without the single, most influential male \nrelationship that will continue to shape their identity throughout \ntheir lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/ Is Fatherhood Fading Out\u0014",

    "words": "Is Your Church Filled with Christian Atheists? \u0014\nJoe LaGuardia\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted: Wednesday, October 9, 2013   Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an article in The Atlantic Monthly, author and editor-at-large \nJonathon Rauch recalled a time he attended a dinner party and was \nasked about his religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nRauch, a self-proclaimed atheist, considered what to say and realized \nthat atheists were no different than theists in that both sets of \npeople try to convince others of their beliefs, seek converts and \nbuild ideological communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauch concluded that he wasn't an atheist.He answered that he was a \n\"practical atheist,\" someone indifferent to his own beliefs or those \nof others.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauch went on to explain that the most convincing practical atheists \nwere not atheists at all, but were Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians he knew personally said they believed in God and \nattended a church, but then acted, lived and made decisions as if God \ndidn't exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article is a direct challenge to Christianity and the church.It \nbegs the question: How many of us say we believe God but then live \nour lives as if God doesn't exist, as if God does not participate in \nour lives every day?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis challenge is not new. The church has been filled with practical \natheists for a long time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his first letter to Timothy, the apostle Paul reveals that \nTimothy's own congregation contains many who believed in myths, \nsuperstitions and \"lies\" (1 Timothy 1:3-4).\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul didn't direct his attack toward non-believers; his accusation \naimed directly at Christians who claimed to believe in Christ but \nacted as if no transformation in Christ  no salvation  had occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul used himself as an example of what it meant to be a practical \natheist.He says in 1 Timothy 1:12-14 that when he was saved in \nChrist, it was God's mercy that saved him from \"unbelief\" as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you recall, Paul was very religious before his conversion to \nChristianity. He believed in God and he believed in Torah.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, even then, in the midst of his religiosity, Paul lived a life of \n\"unbelief.\" No wonder then that, in a few Scripture passages later, \nPaul charged Timothy to \"fight the good fight with faith and a clear \nconscience\" (1 Timothy 1:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking to his congregation on a similar subject, Craig Groeschel, \nwho calls himself a recovering Christian atheist, once asked whether \nany of his churchgoers were practical atheists.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a sermon series that became the subject of his latest book, \"The \nChristian Atheist,\" he posed several thoughts to consider:\u0014\n\u0014\n If you believe in God, but didn't fear God, you might be practical \natheists.\u0014\n\u0014\n If you say you believe God, but pursued happiness at any cost, you \nmight be practical atheists.\u0014\n\u0014\n If you say you believe God, but put your trust in money, you might \nbe practical atheists.\u0014\n\u0014\nGroeschel argued that many Christians find it hard to respond to \nthese challenges because they never mature in their salvation in \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians believe in the Gospel in order to benefit from it \nwhile others believe in the Gospel enough to contribute to it.Very \nfew, he argued, believe in the Gospel enough to give their lives to \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Paul, people who never matured in their belief in God \neventually shipwrecked their faith. This idea of shipwreck is a \npoignant one.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the ancient world, pirates pretended to be stranded to lure \npassing ships to come help them.The ships, unbeknownst to the captain \nin charge, would seek to save the lost but then run aground in \nshallow or rock-laden water.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat starts off as a rescue mission turns tragic because a captain \nloses sight of the destination. With good intentions, he brings his \nship to places that are unfamiliar, treacherous  places born out of \n\"lies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPractical atheism is one of those threats that lurk beneath the \nsurface of all our lives. Paul was right: keeping the faith is like a \nfight, and we must be diligent to stay the course, keep our eyes on \nthe prize and remember that God participates in our lives every \nmoment, every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe LaGuardia is senior pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in Conyers, \nGa.

Drinking alcohol is not illegal \nfor Christians, but as Shiah Islam is the state religion, it is \nprohibited for Muslims; the conviction and sentencing thus reflects \nthe state view that a Muslim cannot change his/her religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother convert from Islam was thought to have been whipped, but \nthere were conflicting reports as to whether it was Mehdi Dadkah  \nalso known as Danial  or Mehdi Reza Omidi, also known as Youhan.\u0014\n\u0014\nA CSW representative said that Taalipasand and the other Christian in \nquestion were flogged with extreme violence.

    "title": "IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BE POOR",
    "words": "It Is Expensive to Be Poor\u0014\n\u0014\nMinimum-wage jobs are physically demanding, have unpredictable \nschedules, and pay so meagerly that workers can't save up enough to \nmove on. \u0014\n\u0014\nBarbara Ehrenreich  Jan 13 2014, The Atlantic\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson made a move that was \nunprecedented at the time and remains unmatched by succeeding \nadministrations. He announced a War on Poverty, saying that its \nchief weapons would be better schools, and better health, and \nbetter homes, and better training, and better job opportunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo starting in 1964 and for almost a decade, the federal government \npoured at least some of its resources in the direction they should \nhave been going all along: toward those who were most in need. \nLongstanding programs like Head Start, Legal Services, and the Job \nCorps were created. Medicaid was established. Poverty among seniors \nwas significantly reduced by improvements in Social Security.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnson seemed to have established the principle that it is the \nresponsibility of government to intervene on behalf of the \ndisadvantaged and deprived. But there was never enough money for the \nfight against poverty, and Johnson found himself increasingly \ndistracted by another and deadlier warthe one in Vietnam. Although \nunderfunded, the War on Poverty still managed to provoke an intense \nbacklash from conservative intellectuals and politicians.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn their view, government programs could do nothing to help the poor \nbecause poverty arises from the twisted psychology of the poor \nthemselves. By the Reagan era, it had become a cornerstone of \nconservative ideology that poverty is caused not by low wages or a \nlack of jobs and education, but by the bad attitudes and faulty \nlifestyles of the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nPicking up on this theory, pundits and politicians have bemoaned the \ncharacter failings and bad habits of the poor for at least the past \n50 years. In their view, the poor are shiftless, irresponsible, and \nprone to addiction. They have too many children and fail to get \nmarried. So if they suffer from grievous material deprivation, if \nthey run out of money between paychecks, if they do not always have \nfood on their tablesthen they have no one to blame but themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1990s, with a bipartisan attack on welfare, this kind of \nprejudice against the poor took a drastically misogynistic turn. Poor \nsingle mothers were identified as a key link in what was called the \ncycle of poverty. By staying at home and collecting welfare, they \nset a toxic example for their children, whoimportant policymakers \ncame to believewould be better off being cared for by paid child \ncare workers or even, as Newt Gingrich proposed, in orphanages.\u0014\n\u0014\nWelfare reform was the answer, and it was intended not only to end \nfinancial support for imperiled families, but also to cure the \nself-induced culture of poverty that was supposedly at the root of \ntheir misery. The original welfare reform billa bill, it should be \nrecalled, which was signed by President Bill Clintonincluded an \nallocation of $100 million for chastity training for low-income \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Recession should have put the victim-blaming theory of \npoverty to rest. In the space of only a few months, millions of \npeople entered the ranks of the officially poornot only laid-off \nblue-collar workers, but also downsized tech workers, managers, \nlawyers, and other once-comfortable professionals. No one could \naccuse these nouveau poor Americans of having made bad choices or \nbad lifestyle decisions. They were educated, hardworking, and \nambitious, and now they were also poorapplying for food stamps, \nshowing up in shelters, lining up for entry-level jobs in retail. \nThis would have been the moment for the pundits to finally admit the \ntruth: Poverty is not a character failing or a lack of motivation. \nPoverty is a shortage of money.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor most women in poverty, in both good times and bad, the shortage \nof money arises largely from inadequate wages. When I worked on my \nbook, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, I took jobs \nas a waitress, nursing-home aide, hotel housekeeper, Wal-Mart \nassociate, and a maid with a house-cleaning service. I did not choose \nthese jobs because they were low-paying. I chose them because these \nare the entry-level jobs most readily available to women.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I discovered is that in many ways, these jobs are a trap: They \npay so little that you cannot accumulate even a couple of hundred \ndollars to help you make the transition to a better-paying job. They \noften give you no control over your work schedule, making it \nimpossible to arrange for child care or take a second job. And in \nmany of these jobs, even young women soon begin to experience the \nphysical deteriorationespecially knee and back problemsthat can \nbring a painful end to their work life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was also dismayed to find that in some ways, it is actually more \nexpensive to be poor than not poor. If you cant afford the first \nmonths rent and security deposit you need in order to rent an \napartment, you may get stuck in an overpriced residential motel. If \nyou dont have a kitchen or even a refrigerator and microwave, you \nwill find yourself falling back on convenience store food, whichin \naddition to its nutritional deficitsis also alarmingly overpriced. \nIf you need a loan, as most poor people eventually do, you will end \nup paying an interest rate many times more than what a more affluent \nborrower would be charged. To be poorespecially with children to \nsupport and care foris a perpetual high-wire act.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost private-sector employers offer no sick days, and many will fire \na person who misses a day of work, even to stay home with a sick \nchild. A nonfunctioning car can also mean lost pay and sudden \nexpenses. A broken headlight invites a ticket, plus a fine greater \nthan the cost of a new headlight, and possible court costs. If a \ncreditor decides to get nasty, a court summons may be issued, often \nleading to an arrest warrant. No amount of training in financial \nliteracy can prepare someone for such exigenciesor make up for an \nincome that is impossibly low to start with. Instead of treating \nlow-wage mothers as the struggling heroines they are, our political \nculture still tends to view them as miscreants and contributors to \nthe cycle of poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf anything, the criminalization of poverty has accelerated since the \nrecession, with growing numbers of states drug testing applicants for \ntemporary assistance, imposing steep fines for school truancy, and \nimprisoning people for debt. Such measures constitute a cruel \ninversion of the Johnson-era principle that it is the responsibility \nof government to extend a helping hand to the poor. Sadly, this has \nbecome the means by which the wealthiest country in the world manages \nto remain complacent in the face of alarmingly high levels of \npoverty: by continuing to blame poverty not on the economy or \ninadequate social supports, but on the poor themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts time to revive the notion of a collective national \nresponsibility to the poorest among us, who are disproportionately \nwomen and especially women of color. Until that happens, we need to \nwake up to the fact that the underpaid women who clean our homes and \noffices, prepare and serve our meals, and care for our \nelderlyearning wages that do not provide enough to live onare the \ntrue philanthropists of our society.\u0014",

    "title": "INFANTICIDE IS ON THE RISE IN PAKISTAN",
    "words": "Infanticide is on the rise in Pakistan\u0014\nby Mariya Karimjee  January 14, 2014  Aljazeera America\u0014\n\u0014\nAid groups say little is being done to stop the killing of newborns \namong Pakistan's poorest \u0014\n\u0014\nKARACHI, Pakistan  Just days after she gave birth, Zaitoun says, her \nhusband killed the child, their first, because she was a girl.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe infant's fate wasn't a surprise to Zaitoun, 26, who moved to \nKarachi, Pakistan's largest city, from the rural northwest three \nyears ago. Zaitoun (who asked that her last name not be used) has a \nround face and thick brown hair that she coils into a bun. Her \nmarriage was arranged, she says, and her husband found her a job \nworking as a nanny for a family in one of Karachi's wealthy \nneighborhoods, where he works as a doorkeeper. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Zaitoun realized she was pregnant, she didn't speak of it to her \nhusband, knowing money was tight and that having a baby would likely \nmean she would lose her job. Her in-laws, whom Zaitoun did tell of \nher pregnancy, advised her to pray that it wouldn't be a girl. Two \ndays after her daughter was born, Zaitoun says, she woke up to find \nthe baby gone. That afternoon, when her husband returned home for \nlunch, she asked him what had happened. \"I took care of it,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later, she says she saw an ambulance crew pick up a tiny \ncorpse from a trash dump outside her apartment building. In the six \nmonths she had been living in Haryana Colony, a squatters' settlement \nwhere some of Karachi's poorest families live, Zaitoun saw three \nother dead babies removed the same way, she says. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Pakistan becomes more urbanized, Karachi's population has grown \nexponentially. Most of the migrants who move from villages to the \ncity in search of better economic opportunities end up living in \ndensely packed, illegal housing settlements like Haryana Colony. The \nresidents here straddle the poverty line, have limited access to \neducation and are often uninformed about birth-control options. \nIncreasingly, they are turning to infanticide  killing a child \nwithin a year of birth  aid groups say.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn South Asia, killing children is nothing new, and girls are \nparticularly vulnerable. Parents do it to help feed their sons, who \nare more highly valued in Pakistani society. But the number of \nchildren killed has risen steadily over the last five years, welfare \norganizations in Karachi say. The Edhi Foundation, Pakistan's largest \nwelfare agency, says the number of dead babies its ambulances pick up \nhas increased by almost 20 percent each year since 2010.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The price of bread is rising, more immigrants are moving into \nKarachi, and job security is nonexistent in the country,\" says an \nEdhi official, Anwar Kazmi. While the number of corpses the \nfoundation has found nationwide is startling, he adds, it does not \nbegin to convey the full scope of the problem; it does not include \nbabies killed in rural areas, for instance, or those secretly buried \nby whoever killed them.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther organizations, such as the Chhipa Welfare Association and the \nAman Foundation, report similar increases, a trend they say may \nintensify as the cost of living in Karachi continues to rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Kazmi says money is only one reason for the country's high \ninfanticide rate. \"Many more are killed because they are born out of \nwedlock,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Pakistan's socially conservative society, illegitimate children \nare referred to as \"harami,\" an Arabic word that means \"forbidden \nunder Islam\"  an admission, Kazmi says, that the parents have sinned.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the baby is a boy, an aunt or grandparent may pretend the child \nis theirs, and the boy could survive,\" he explains. \"But in Pakistan, \ngirls are considered bad fortune, and for this reason, many of the \nchildren killed are girls.\"\u0014\nThree streets down from Zaitoun's apartment, Maryam sits with her \n17-year-old daughter, Asma, in the one-room apartment they share with \nfour others. (Maryam declined to give her last name, and Asma asked \nthat her name be changed.) A year ago, Asma gave birth to a child out \nof wedlock. A few minutes after the birth, Maryam suffocated the baby \nwith a pillow, the two acknowledge. They then waited 10 minutes to be \nsure the baby was really dead. That night, Maryam doused the corpse \nin kerosene and left it on a trash heap that was already ablaze, \nwhile Asma waited at home. Asma, quietly fiddling with her long, \nthick braid as her mother tells the story, says she never even \nlearned the gender of her newborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaryam considered making Asma get an abortion, she says, but decided \nagainst it. Abortions are legal only in limited circumstances in \nPakistan and are typically carried out by untrained practitioners in \nmakeshift clinics. Maryam says she has heard horror stories from \nwomen who have undergone the procedure and was worried that something \ncould go wrong and that her daughter could die or lose the ability to \nbear children. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a global \nnonprofit that studies reproductive health, \\about 200,000 women are \nhospitalized in Pakistan each year for complications due to illegal \nabortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsma and Maryam did not previously tell anyone about the birth, and \nMaryam says she feels no regret, reasoning that she saved not only \nher daughter but also her grandchild from a life of misery and pain. \nIn December, Asma got married in an arranged marriage that was \nplanned three years ago. Her husband was not the child's father. She \ndoesn't intend to tell him about her pregnancy, and she hopes he \nnever learns the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a while, when she was pregnant, Asma says, she would sometimes go \nto one of the safe havens the Edhi Foundation has set up to encourage \nmothers to drop off unwanted infants rather than kill them. The \norganization created 400 such sites, but the program has had limited \nsuccess. Just 18 babies were dropped off at sites in Karachi in 2013, \nwhile Edhi says it buried more than 1,300 babies last year.\u0014",

    "title": "IS GOOGLE MAKING US STUPID?",
    "words": "In 2008, Nicolas Carr wrote an article called, Is Google Making Us \nStupid? The question examines whether our reliance on search engines \nas a shortcut is making us flabby in knowing how to dig for research. \nIn a preview of his forthcoming book, The Glass Cage, he asks a \nsimilar question of the dark side of our advances in technological \ngadgetry. If a GPS makes map-reading obsolete, if robotic surgical \nprocess automates routine procedures, if pilots can push a button and \nchillax, then, in Carrs words, It makes getting what we want \neasier, but distances us from the work of knowing. My new car \nvolunteered to help me parallel park. Will I forget how to do it \nmyself?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps this is more than an old-timers nostalgia. Psychologists \nsince the 1970s have been documenting the generation effect. Rooted \nin studies of vocabulary, the generation effect reveals that people \nbetter remember words when they generate them rather than simply read \nthem. When you actively engage in learning something, your neural \ncircuits ensure that the hard work you are doing turns into something \nyou are able to retain and tap into later. You develop skills in \npattern recognition and information organization. On the other hand, \nif you simply Google it, you get it quickly, but lose it just as \nquickly. And, needless to say, the trend is simply to put matters on \nautopilot and Google it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe implications of this cultural trend for ministry are profound. We \nwho are interested in the spiritual formation of disciples had better \nact wisely regarding the temptation to settle for knowledge when what \nis called for is imprinting. As Mike Breen says, The path from \ninformation to innovation only passes through imitation. Dont \nsimply give a newlywed couple a book on marriage. Invite them into \nyour home and have them watch you and your spouse demonstrate what it \nlooks like.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe costs of convenience are complacency and disengagement. The \nancients had a category for it within the seven deadly sins. They \ncalled it sloth, or acedia, which translates as, I dont care. \nDont Google that.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Chandleer, ABP News 1/29/14\u0014",

The Roman guards knew \u0014\nThat when the nails were being hammered into the \u0014\nWrist, that tendon would tear and \u0014\nBreak, forcing Jesus to use His back \u0014\nMuscles to support himself, so that He could breathe.  \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth of His feet \u0014\nWere nailed together. Thus He was forced to \u0014\nSupport Himself on the single nail that \u0014\nImpaled His feet to the cross. Jesus could \u0014\nNot support himself with His legs for long because of the pain, \u0014\nso He was forced to alternate between arching His \u0014\nBack and using his legs just to continue to \u0014\nBreath. Imagine the struggle, the pain, the \u0014\nSuffering, the courage. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus endured this \u0014\nReality for over 3 hours. \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, \u0014\nOver 3 hours! Can you imagine this kind of \u0014\nSuffering? A few minutes before He died, \u0014\nJesus stopped bleeding. He was simply pouring water \u0014\nFrom his wounds. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom common images we see wounds to His hands and feet and even the \nspear wound to His side... \u0014\nBut do we remember the many wounds \u0014\nMade to his body. A hammer \u0014\nDriving large nails through the wrists, the feet overlapped \u0014\nAnd a nail hammered through the arches, then a \u0014\nRoman guard piercing His side with a spear. And... \u0014\nBefore the nails and the spear, Jesus was whipped and \u0014\nBeaten. The whipping was so severe that it tore the \u0014\nFlesh from His body. The beating so horrific that His \u0014\nFace was torn and his beard ripped from His face. The \u0014\nCrown of thorns (two to three inch thorns) cut deeply into His scalp. \nMost men \u0014\nWould not have survived this torture. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had no more blood \u0014\nTo bleed out, only water poured from His \u0014\nWounds. The \u0014\nHuman adult body contains about 3.5 liters \u0014\n(just less than a gallon) of blood. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus poured all 3.5 liters of his blood; \u0014\nHe had three nails hammered into His \u0014\nMembers; a crown of thorns on His head and, beyond \u0014\nThat, a Roman soldier who stabbed a spear into His \u0014\nChest.. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll these without \u0014\nMentioning the humiliation He passed after carrying His own \u0014\nCross for almost 2 kilometers, while the crowd spat in his \u0014\nFace and threw stones (the cross beam was almost 30 kg of weight, to \nwhich His hands were nailed). \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus had to endure this experience, \u0014\nSo that you may have free access to God.\u0014\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why it's so very hard for many people to believe in a loving \nGod or the truth of the Gospel story.\u0014",

Favoured costumes of Israel's Haredim, or \nultra-Orthodox Jews, have been the garb of Cossack horsemen, who once \nlaunched pogroms against them in eastern Europe. The enemy of choice \nthis year might have been the Israeli army, but nervous rabbis \npre-emptively banned anyone from dressing up in khaki uniforms.\u0014\n\u0014\nA decision in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, to criminalise \nultra-Orthodox Jews refusing to abide by Israel's military draft has \nbrought relations between the country's 800,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews \nand the 5m others to their worst level since Israel was established \nin 1948. Anti-Zionist graffiti litters the Haredim's bastions in \nJerusalem. Haredi protesters have replaced the silent middle Hebrew \nletter in Israel's name with another one, rendering it as \nYesh-raal-\"There's Poison\". And earlier this month hundreds of \nthousands poured onto Jerusalem's main highway for a mass communal \nprayer-cum-protest, closing it to traffic for hours. \"Let us study \nthe Torah,\" they cried, mockingly asking how any Jewish state could \nprevent students from studying it. One ultra-Orthodox sect vowed that \nit would flee Israel if the authorities attempted to enforce the law. \n\"We owe our survival to the Torah, not to squadrons of fighter-jets,\" \nsaid a protester.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Yair Lapid, a standard-bearer of Israel's secular Jews, the \nHaredi conscription law is a crowning achievement. As finance \nminister and leader of Israel's second-largest party, he pushed \nthrough the bill by 67 votes to one on March 12th, with most of the \nopposition boycotting the session. His supporters, concentrated in \nthe coastal metropolis around Tel Aviv, portrayed the ultra-Orthodox \nas welfare scroungers living off secular taxpayers who pay income tax \nand risk their lives in patriotic combat. \"Share the netel,\" meaning \nthe burden, is their battle-cry.\u0014\n\u0014\nFearful that Mr Lapid might take his 18 fellow parliamentarians out \nof the ruling coalition, thus toppling it, Binyamin Netanyahu, \nIsrael's prime minister, rallied to his call. So too did Jewish Home, \nwhich as a party of religious Zionism values military service as well \nas Torah study.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the generals want the ultra-Orthodox in their ranks no more than \nthe ultra-Orthodox want to join up. Army recruitment centres are \nalready struggling with a surfeit of brawn at a time when Israel's \nfighting machine is becoming increasingly automated, with drones \nrather than infantrymen to the fore. So some argue that if the \ngovernment was really serious about integrating the ultra-Orthodox \nand rescuing them from poverty they would have done better to push \nthem out of the proliferating Torah colleges and into jobs instead of \nuniforms.\u0014",

They are better for it. In many \ncases, so are we. Thomas Edison, as a boy, received a blow on his ear \nwhich impaired his hearing. What a tragedy! Later he felt his \ndeafness was a blessing, because it was a tool by which he was saved \nfrom distractions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This allowed him to concentrate on his work, and out of that \nconcentration emerged some of the greatest inventions of all times. \nVictor Hugo, a literary genius of France, was exiled from his country \nby Napoleon. What a tragedy! Out of that period of exile arose some \nof his most creative works. When he later returned home in triumph, \nhe asked, \"Why was I not exiled earlier?\"\u0014\n\"Helen Keller, born blind and deaf, faced obstacle after obstacle in \nher life. However, on more than one occasion she confided, \"I thank \nGod for my obstacles, for through them I have found myself, my work \nand my God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"George Frederick Handel was at a low point in his life. His money \nwas gone, and his creditors hounded him, threatening him with \nimprisonment. His right side became paralyzed, and his health \ndeteriorated. For a brief time, he was tempted to give up. In the \nmidst of the darkness, he picked himself up and began to do the only \nthing he knew to dowrite music. Out of that despair he wrote the \noratorio known as The Messiah, which many consider the greatest piece \nof church music in history.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The fiber tying Edison, Hugo, Keller and Handel together is that \nthese people refused to be defeated by their problems.

    "title": "IN THE BEGINNING -- AT LEAST IT'S ONE ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN",
    "words": "In a recent Breakpoint commentary, John Stonestreet writes: \"You've \nlikely heard of the Big Bang Theory. You may not have known that \nuntil last week that we had no direct evidence of it. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Maybe now we do. As reported in Discovery News, 'Scientists founda \nkey polarization, or orientation, of the microwaves caused by \ngravitational wavesminiature ripples in the fabric of space.' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The presence of such ripples, they explain, is exactly what we'd \nexpect if the universe had begun with a Big Bang. The key word is \nbegun. You know, as in, 'In the beginning.' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"As recently as the mid-20th century, the scientific consensus on the \nuniverse's beginning was that it had no beginning. The reigning \ntheory, called Steady State, or the idea that the cosmos always \nexisted and always would, went kablooey in the 1940s and '50s when \nexposed to new evidence, such as cosmic microwave background \nradiation. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This suggested an explosive beginning, in which the universe as we \nknow it expanded suddenly from an infinitely tiny point of matter and \nenergy called a singularity. The nickname Big Bang quickly stuck, and \nmost astronomers and physicists have been referring to it as a matter \nof fact ever since. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"So what existed before the Big Bang? Well, scientists tell us that's \na nonsensical question, because the Big Bang didn't just give birth \nto the material universe, but to time and space themselves. Not only \nwas there no what, why and how logically prior to this event; there \nwas neither when nor where. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What if there was a Who? That's the question Leslie A. Wickman \nraises at CNN.com in a piece titled, 'Does the Big Bang Breakthrough \nOffer Proof of God?' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"'(T)his new evidence,' she writes, 'strongly suggests there was a \nbeginning to our universe. If the universe did indeed have a \nbeginning, by the simple logic of cause and effect, there had to be \nan agentseparate and apart from the effectthat caused it. That \nsounds a lot like Genesis 1:1 to me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The late NASA astrophysicist Robert Jastrow put it still more \neloquently. Taking evidence for the Big Bang as a given, he remarked \nin a 1982 interview with Christianity Today that, 'Astronomershave \nproven, by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act \nof creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every \nplanet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth.' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"They have found that all this happened as a product of forces they \ncannot hope to discover. That there are what I or anyone would call \nsupernatural forces at work is now, I think, a scientifically proven \nfact.'\"\u0014",

Three hundred miles away, at Fort Ticonderoga in \nNew York, lay the answer to the Patriots' problem: cannons. If the \nPatriots could somehow get the heavy artillery to Bostonan idea that \nmade several officers shake their headsthey could drive the British \nout. With Washington's blessing, Knox hurried to Ticonderoga; chose \n59 big guns; loaded them onto sleds pulled by horses, oxen, and men; \nand headed south. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Day after day, they skidded along snow-covered trails. They lurched \nthrough mud and mountainous drifts, heaved up rough hills and down \nsteep valleys. Crossing the frozen Hudson River, the ice cracked and \na huge gun broke through. Somehow the men pulled it out. In late \nFebruary the \"noble train of artillery\" reached Boston. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"During the first few days of March, Washington's army made a big \nracket to distract the enemy while they moved the guns into place. \nEarly one morning, a sleepy British sentry blinked in disbelief \nthrough the dawn mists toward Dorchester Heights, where Knox's \ncannons, as if appearing out of nowhere, aimed straight at him. The \nBritish, realizing they could no longer hold the city, soon boarded \ntheir fleet and sailed away. Henry Knox's long haul had saved Boston. \nIt was the first major victory of the Revolutionary War.\" (from Bill \nBennett's American Patriot Daily Almanac newsletter)\u0014",

    "title": "IS CHRISTIANITY OPPRESSIVE TO WOMEN?",
    "words": "Is Christianity Oppressive to Women? \u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes our Christian heritage must be overcome, not celebrated. \u0014\nLinda Hartz Rump | posted 8/08/2008 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the beginning of Christianity, women have been included in the \nNew Community. In some times and places, they have found the church \nmore affirming and liberating than their surrounding cultures. But in \nothers, the church has fallen far from its Biblewhich sees both \nsexes as of equal worth. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring its early years, Christianity taught a spiritual unity that at \nleast potentially mitigated the harshness of Roman law, in which \nwomen were considered non-citizens with no legal rights. Inequality \nwas everywhere in this system; for example, while men's adultery was \nassumed, women's was punishable by death. Over against this culture, \nthe ideal of the early church is captured in the words of Paul, \"Be \nsubject to one another in the fear of Christ\" (Eph 5:21). And women \ndid, as we will see, gain some status \"in Christ,\" filling key roles \nwithin the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis continued to be true in the Middle Ages, when society at large \nassumed women would marry and bear many childrenindeed, among the \nelite, parents often arranged or forced marriage on their daughters. \nMonastic life offered many women an attractive alternative. This was \na life of devotion, scholarship, travel, and spiritual fellowship and \nequal dialogue with male monastics and church leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, the potential equality embedded in Jesus' message often \nfailed to pan out in the teachings and practice of the church. In Men \nand Women in the Church: Building Consensus on Christian Leadership \n(InterVarsity Press, 2003), Dr. Sarah Sumner examines the church's \ndecidedly spotty record on treatment of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nSumner cites several expressions of a deep prejudice against women in \nthe writings of the Church Fathers. The first is from a 3rd-century \ntreatise titled \"On the Dress of Women,\" written and presented to an \naudience of women by Tertullianthe influential teacher and coiner of \nthe term \"Trinity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHere Tertullian likens all women to Eve, calling them \"the devil's \ngateway,\" \"the unsealer of that forbidden tree,\" and \"she who \npersuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack.\" It \nwas because of Eve, Tertullian argued, and therefore because of all \nwomankind, that \"God's image, man\" was condemned to death, and that \nthe Son of God himself had to come and die. In light of this, he \nadded, how dare any woman \"think about adorning yourself over and \nabove your tunics of skins?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSumner also cites Ambrose, the bishop of Milan from 374 to 397 A.D. \nIn his treatise \"On Paradise,\" Ambrose wrote that \"though the man was \ncreated outside Paradise, an inferior place, he is found to be \nsuperior, while woman, though created in a better place, inside \nParadise, is found inferior.\" For Ambrose, it was a fact of nature \nthat men are superior to women.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine, probably the most famous theologian in all of church \nhistory, believed that God did not create the woman for any reason \nother than procreation. Explicitly he said, \"I cannot think of any \nreason for woman's being made as man's helper, if we dismiss the \nreason of procreation.\" He felt that companionship was no part of \nGod's plan for the relationship between the sexes. For the purpose of \nconversation, he argued, \"how much more agreeable it is for two male \nfriends to dwell together than for a man and a woman!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDeclares Sumner, \"If the church fathers were prejudiced against \nwomen, and we know it, then we should be careful not to absorb their \nbias.\" In other words, \"Traditional Christian thinking is not the \nsame thing as biblical thinking about women.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see:\u0014\nChristian History Home > News > 2004 > Is Christianity Oppressive to \nWomen?\u0014",

    "words": "Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus' heart was full. He wished his friend Marcianus could be \nwith him so that they could talk about Christ, but that was \nimpossible. So he picked up his pen. They might be separated by \ndistance but a letter could capture his feelings. He dipped the quill \nin ink and began to write:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Knowing, my beloved Marcianus, your desire to walk in godliness, \nwhich alone leads man to life eternal, I rejoice with you and make my \nprayer that you may preserve your faith entire and so be pleasing to \nGod who made you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus wrote many things, not only to Marcianus, but to others. \nThese writings are of the utmost importance, for they show the state \nof Christianity in the second century after Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse teaching (heresy) had gained destructive power. In another \nlengthy writing, Irenaeus listed these and gave Christian answers to \ntheir false claims. One of his arguments was that only the universal \nchurch had the truth which it had passed from bishop to bishop. \nIrenaeus was in a strong position when making this claim. He had \npersonally known Polycarp, the martyred bishop from Asia Minor who in \nturn had known St. John and other apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne heresy of the day that Irenaeus took the trouble to answer was \nGnosticism. Gnosticism claimed that one needed a special, hidden \nknowledge if one's soul was to be saved. Irenaeus must have had this \nin mind when he wrote Marcianus:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This then is the order of the rule of our faith, and the foundation \nof the building, and the stability of our conversation: God, the \nFather, not made, not material, invisible; one God, the creator of \nall things: this is the first point of our faith. The second point \nis: The Word of God, Son of God, Christ Jesus our Lord...And the \nthird point is: The Holy Spirit, through whom the prophets \nprophesied, and the fathers learned the things of God, and the \nrighteous were led forth into the way of righteousness; and who in \nthe end of the times was poured out in a new way upon mankind in all \nthe earth, renewing man unto God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And for this reason the baptism of our regeneration proceeds through \nthese three points: God the Father bestowing on us regeneration \nthrough His Son by the Holy Spirit. For as many as carry (in them) \nthe Spirit of God are led to the Word, that is to the Son; and the \nSon brings them to the Father; and the Father causes them to possess \nincorruption.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus became a leader in the church in Lyons, France. In 177, the \nLyons' leadership sent him to Rome with a message. While he was away, \nheathen authorities arrested his bishop and many other Christians and \nkilled them as martyrs in the arena in a savage spectacle. These \nincluded Blandina, one of history's best known martyr women.\u0014\n\u0014\nIreneaus' writings powerfully declared that the true church had the \ntruth because it had Scripture on its side as well as sound reason, \nthe guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the memories of those who had \nknown the apostles. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis feast is on this day, June 28. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "IMMIGRANTS ARE GIVING US THE BUSINESS",
    "words": "Saturday, July 19, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Barton Hinkle         Richmond Times-Dispatch \u0014\n\u0014\nImmigration hawks make many weak arguments, so it is hard to pick the \nweakest. But one contender you see a lot goes like this: If you \nthink the U.S. should welcome those people, then I assume youll be \nputting some of them up in your own home, wontcha? Hunh? Howaboutit, \nbuddy?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first blush this could seem like a pretty devastating takedown, \nalong the lines of the old joke by Will Rogers  who once said he was \nso old he could remember when a liberal was someone who was generous \nwith his own money.\\\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago Arthur Brooks gave that joke empirical heft in his \nbook Who Really Cares? He went in search of data about charitable \ngiving and found, to his surprise, that conservatives as a group tend \nto be far more personally generous than liberals. Among other things, \nhe noted that if liberals donated blood at the same rate \nconservatives do, the nations blood supply would jump by 45 percent. \nThis confounding of stereotypes (liberals are compassionate, \nconservatives are not) seems mystifying, at least until you note \neconomist Bryan Caplans observation that while voluntary charity is \ncostly to the giver, voting for charity is virtually free.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats what makes the immigration hawks argument seem so powerful: \nIt makes the pro-immigration side look like hypocrites.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that impression rests on a misunderstanding. Because, in fact, a \ngreat many Americans are willing to offering housing to immigrants. \nAnd to hire them, and to sell them groceries, and peddle clothing to \nthem, and so on. In fact, it is precisely the willingness of many \nAmericans to hire immigrants that drives another anti-immigration \nargument: If we let too many immigrants into the country, they will \ntake our jobs. (More on that fallacy shortly.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSo here comes Juan, traipsing across the border in search of a better \nlife. Lucas runs a construction company and would be happy to pay \nJuan to swing a hammer. Mike owns an apartment complex and would \ngladly rent Juan a room. Amanda would like to sell Juan some \ngroceries. Steve wants Juan to have a few drinks at his nightclub. \nAnd so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile theres Sebastian, a professor of literary theory, who \nsupports broader immigration policy but doesnt want to turn his \npersonal residence into a rooming house for new undocumented \narrivals. Imagine how ridiculous it would be to say to Lucas and Mike \nand Amanda and Steve: Look, we know you all want to do business with \nJuan  but we cant let you, because Sebastian isnt interested. \nWhere is the sense in that?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo hear some border hawks talk, immigrants want to come to America \nonly so they can sponge off welfare programs supported by hardworking \nAmericans. The truth is much closer to the opposite. Among \nworking-age men, immigrants are more likely to be working than native \nU.S. citizens. In fact, illegal immigrants are the most likely to \nwork: In one recent year, 93 percent of undocumented alien males \nparticipated in the labor force. The figure for legal immigrants was \n86 percent. Among native-born American men, it was 81 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmigrants also show a greater entrepreneurial spirit than \nnative-born Americans. In a 2012 report, the Partnership for a New \nAmerican Economy notes this: Over the last 15 years, while \nnative-born Americans have become less likely to start a business, \nimmigrants have steadily picked up the slack. Immigrants are now more \nthan twice as likely as the native-born to start a business and were \nresponsible for more than one in every four (28 percent) U.S. \nbusinesses founded in 2011, significantly outpacing their share of \nthe population (12.9 percent).\u0014\n\u0014\nImmigrant-owned businesses in the U.S. generate more than $775 \nbillion in sales and pay more than $126 billion in payroll each year. \nMuch of that prosperity derives from exports  immigrant-owned \nbusinesses are more than 60 percent more likely to export than \nnon-immigrant businesses, says the report  which makes perfect \nsense (who better than a Guatemalan native to sell U.S. goods in \nGuatemala?).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe entrepreneurship figures are significant because most new jobs \nare created by new businesses. As the Partnership paper reports, one \nin every 10 workers at privately owned U.S. companies now works at an \nimmigrant-owned company.  Altogether, immigrant-owned businesses \nhave collectively created 4 million jobs that exist today in the \nUnited States.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere it not for business starts by immigrants, the U.S. jobs picture \nwould look much more grim than it does. Immigrants arent taking jobs \nfrom millions of Americans  theyre giving jobs to millions of \nAmericans. And doing business with millions more.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not the Sebastian of our example above. Doesnt Sebastians \nwillingness to let Juan enter the country, combined with his \nunwillingness to let Juan stay at his house, still make him a \nhypocrite? No. If Sebastian is willing to let Juan enter the country \nso he can do business with Lucas and Mike and Amanda and Steve, he \nisnt being a moral phony. He is simply minding his own business.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe the border hawks should try it some time.\u0014",

    "title": "ISAAC WATTS' BIRTHDAY SERMON",
    "words": "In the annals of hymn writing, Isaac Watts shines as a leading \nluminary. In most Reformation countries, hymns were employed in \nworship but seldom in the English church before Watts was born. \nAnglicans sang the Psalms. Psalm singing, which had at first been a \nwelcome innovation, become a dreary, unmelodious chanting. Each line \nwas first read out by a clerk and then sung. Through Isaac Watts' \ninfluence, that changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts was born in Southampton, England on this day July 17, 1674. He \nfell under conviction in 1688 and learned to trust Christ in a \npersonal way a year later. No doubt his father's influence was felt \nhere, for his father was twice imprisoned for refusing to bend to the \nChurch of England beliefs. Later Isaac refused to take an \nall-expenses-paid education rather than conform himself to the Church \nof England. After attaining his education under more difficult \ncircumstances, Watts became a preacher. He gave his first sermon on \nthis day, his birthday, July 17, 1698, at Mark Lane in London. His \nqualities were such that the church soon named him its assistant \npastor. Shortly afterward he became seriously ill and suffered such \npoor health the remainder of his life that he was often unable to \ncarry out his church duties.\u0014\n\u0014\nA kindly friend, Sir Thomas Abney took him under his roof and there \nhe lived thirty years. The church also showed much wisdom and charity \nin continuing to support him despite his fevers and neuralgia. A lady \nwho fell in love with him from reading his hymns is said to have \nrejected him close up upon finding him small and far from handsome.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his lack of beauty, Watts wrote inspiring poems which were \nattractive to worshippers. Scarcely a hymnbook today in the English \nspeaking nations is without one or more of his hymns. Psalm singing \nhad fallen into a sad state and church leaders were seriously \nquestioning what to do. Watts boldly called for a new kind of psalm, \nrewritten in light of the New Testament gospel. \"We preach the gospel \nand pray in Christ's name, and then check [stifle] the aroused \ndevotions of Christians by giving out a song of the old dispensation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nActing on his own word, he published a collection of Christianized \npsalms in 1719. Even before this, in 1707, he published his Hymns and \nSpiritual Songs. They include \"Joy to the World.\" These, not his \nsermons, are his true gift to the church and inspired Charles \nWesley's even more successful endeavors.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts faced fierce opposition. Many church leaders were opposed to \nhis efforts and some called his hymns \"Watt's Whims.\" The common \npeople, however, delighted in them. Eventually the Church of England \nrevised its stand and began adding hymns to their worship. His most \nfamous songs point to Christ:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I survey the wondrous cross\u0014\non which the Prince of glory died, \u0014\nmy richest gain I count but loss, \u0014\nand pour contempt on all my pride.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nBenson, Louis F.

    "words": "There are various versions of the rapture, but they have in common \nthe belief that Christians will be removed from the world by God \nduring the \"end times.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMost who believe there will be rapture expect it to be followed by a \nseven-year Great Tribulation, which will lead to the Second Coming of \nJesus, a thousand-year reign of Christ on earth (the \"millennium\"), \nand then eternity. Some predict the rapture during the middle of the \nGreat Tribulation, others at the end, but most are \n\"pre-tribulational.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIs this doctrine biblical? \u0014\n\u0014\nI became a Christian in a church where the pre-tribulational rapture \nwas a theological given, as assumed as the virgin birth and the \nbodily resurrection of Jesus. My first study Bible was a Scofield \nBible, which taught the rapture as fact. My first biblical commentary \nwas by Hal Lindsay, who did more in the 1970s and 1980s to popularize \nthe rapture than anyone else. \u0014\n\u0014\nImagine my surprise when I took a seminar in college on the Book of \nRevelation, and discovered that conservative biblical scholars have \nheld at least seven different approaches to the end times. In \naddition to the rapture position (usually called \"premillennial \ndispensational\"), popular options today range from \"preterist\" (the \nBook of Revelation was fulfilled in the first century, with no \npredictive elements) to \"historic premillenialists\" (Jesus will \nreturn before the millennium, but there will be no rapture), to \n\"amillennial\" (Revelation is intentionally symbolic, with no literal \nrapture or millennium), to \"postmillennial\" (Jesus will return after \nthe millennium). \u0014\n\u0014\nThen I attended Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I \nhad only one professor who espoused the rapture doctrine. All the \nothers accepted either the amillennial or historic premillennial \npositions. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's what matters: Jesus is coming back. No one knows when. We have \nonly today to be ready. Whether he raptures the church before (or \nduring, or after) a Great Tribulation, or returns to begin the \nmillennium, or simply returns to end history and begin eternity, is \nnot the practical question. You and I have no say in the matter. We \nare on the preparation committee, not the planning committee. Our job \nis to be ready when he comes, however he comes. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of Revelation, John could pray: \"Come, Lord Jesus!\" \n(Revelation 22:20).

They are dead, \u0014\nand their three children orphaned, because of a \u0014\nrumor that they burned a Koran while dispos- \u0014\ning of trash. The kiln owner locked them in his \u0014\noffice, while clerics used the local mosque's loud- \u0014\nspeakers to denounce the couple and whip up a \u0014\n. mob. Some 1,200 men from surrounding neigh- \u0014\nborhoods showed up, \"equipped with hockey \u0014\nsticks, rods, crowbars, and a blind, terrifying \u0014\nrage.\" They beat the couple to death and burned \u0014\ntheir bodies in the very kiln where the two had \u0014\ntoiled all their lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs is so often true in blasphemy cases, the alleged \u0014\nKoran desecration was just a pretext to hide the \u0014\nreal motive for murder, said Hassan Javid. Then hundreds of Paki- \u0014\nstanis \"heed calls for mob violence, even though \u0014\nthese very same people might condemn acts of \u0014\ncruelty and evil in other contexts.\" This blood- \u0014\nshed is fueled by Pakistan's blasphemy laws, said \u0014\nMurtaza Haider in Dawn. People found guilty \u0014\nof insulting Islam can be sentenced to death, and \u0014\nrampaging mobs like the one that killed the \u0014\nMasihs think they're simply speeding up the \u0014\njudicial process. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe law is just part of the problem, said Ayaz \u0014\nAmir in The News International. Lynch mobs \u0014\nare outside the law, after all. Pakistan is simply \u0014\nunable \"to fulfill its primary responsibility of \u0014\nprotecting the life, honor, and property of its \u0014\ncitizens.\" We've seen many instances of violent \u0014\nmobs torching Christian neighborhoods while \u0014\nthe police do nothing, or even participate. Just a \u0014\nday after the couple was killed, a policeman in \u0014\nanother town axed to death a prisoner accused \u0014\nof blasphemy. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2011, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who crusaded \u0014\nagainst the blasphemy law and defended Christians, was \u0014\nassassinated by his bodyguard. A large part of society, including\u0014\n lawyers and professionals, hailed his killer as an Islamic hero,\u0014\n \"showering him with rose petals\" at his trial. Lynch mobs don't arise\u0014\n unless many people feel they can get away with murder-and \u0014\nin Pakistan, apparently, they can.\u0014",

    "title": "I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING",
    "words": "While sailing at Smith Mountain Lake some years ago, a stout wind had \nfilled my sail. My little boat came to life and I leaned out over the \ngunwale to counteract the heeling of the mast against the force of \nthe wind. I felt exhilarated as the sailboat and I, as one, ripped \nalong over the water.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats when a jetski shot past. A wave from its wake heaved up under \nthe exposed hull of my little vessel and shoved my boat over. I found \nmyself kicking in the water, grappling with the sail, tangled in the \nrigging, and thankful I wore a life jacket. It took me a while to \ndisentangle myself but after some struggle, I managed to right the \nhull, climb back in, erect the mast, re-rig the sail, and eventually \nmake it back to the dock.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one had seen me. I sat on the dock, wet and shivering listening to \nthe far-off whine of another jet ski, or jet skis, and felt a \nsmoldering anger. Theyd ruined my reach across the channel. Theyd \nruined my morning. It had been peaceful and quiet as I partnered with \nwind and water in the ancient mariners art. Then an unforeseen \ncontingency impinged. I hadnt seen THAT coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then, it happened again  in October, 2013.\u0014\n\u0014\nId retired from pastoral ministry in March of 2013 and had set a new \ncourse, so to speak. Like that amateur sailor in the little sailboat, \nI had focused on a distant horizon and unfurled my sail. With a few \nfriends, Id helped found the Epiphany Institute of Spirituality. Id \nreengaged my singer-songwriter self. Id finished a long-delayed \nwriting project and was waiting on the books publishing. I was \nbeginning to cruise, picking up steam, gathering way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen on a Saturday morning as I read the Washington Post online, my \nwife asked me to close my computer to hear something she had to tell \nme. She took a deep breath and with obvious fear and trembling told \nme that she had come to the realization that she was a lesbian. It \nwas the toughest thing shed ever had to do, she said, because she \nknew it would change our lives inexorably. It did.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn so many ways, she had made a courageous decision. \u0014\n\u0014\nI felt as if Id ship wrecked, though, as I realized that a 33-year \nmarriage was ending. It was as if an unforeseen wave had heaved me \nover into the water. I immediately went into a sort of survival mode, \nstruggling to right the hull and get back under way. I wondered where \nI might find harbor that could shelter me long enough to make \nrepairs, read new charts and determine what course I should take. \nAfter all, this particular voyage had been profoundly interrupted. I \nhadnt seen THAT coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats why I havent been blogging.\u0014\n\u0014\nI found a safe harbor, though. As I reached out to the people whose \nrelationships have survived the years, an opportunity emerged from an \nold friendship. Id worked with Malcolm Marler at the University of \nLouisville in the Department of Psychiatry back in the early 80s \nwhen he and I were doing our clinical training. Malcolm now directs \nthe Pastoral Care Department at the University of Alabama, Birmingham \nHospital and needed a program manager for an initiative called The \nSupport Team Network. He encouraged me to interview. I did, they \nhired me, and here I am. I didnt see THAT coming, either.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, I live in a beautiful neighborhood, have a new cadre of \ncompetent and very interesting colleagues, a challenging and \nrewarding job, joined a cool-n-funky, one-of-a-kind church, Baptist \nChurch of the Covenant, and the means to travel to Virginia on a \nregular basis in order to keep contact with my 95 year-old mother, my \nbeloved daughter, Melissa, and nurture on-going friendships which I \ndo not want to let languish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, over the past 14 months, Ive experienced not just \npain, but a great deal of grace. Indeed, these months have ushered in \nsome profound lessons in spirituality I would not have learned \notherwise, lessons which I will humbly share in my resumed blogging. \nFor one thing, Ive learned that the beach on which your wreck tosses \nyou just might be the shore of an undiscovered country thatll \nbring you more blessing than a safe arrival at your previously \nintended destination.\u0014",

She didn't say anything, \nbut she made me feel so at peace, and I woke up this morning feeling \nthat my world, which has been so hectic here lately, is okay and that \nI need to be at peace about my life.

    "words": "Infamous Indulgence Led to Reformation\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWarlike Pope Julius II died in 1513, and his successor, Giovanni \nde' Medici, took the name Pope Leo X. If Julius loved to fight, Leo \npreferred amusement. His self-indulgence destroyed the unity of the \nwestern church when he bartered sin for money in the most infamous \nindulgence of \tchurch history.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFrom birth Leo had been earmarked for the church. At the age of \nseven he was made a monk. By thirteen he was a cardinal. In between, \nthe boy had been abbot. He became pope before turning forty.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHis tastes were costly. He was only too happy to spend lavishly on \nhimself and voluptuous entertainment. Humanists with few morals \nswarmed at a papal court where wit mattered more than witness. Plays \nand shows, ballets and games abounded. No chance for a hunt was \nturned down. The papal treasury funded preeminent artists such as \nRaphael. Julius left a full treasury. Leo drained it in eight short \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's basilica was being rebuilt, but there was no money. Leo \ndecided to solve the problem in time-honored fashion. On this day \nMarch 15, 1517 he declared that anyone who contributed to the \ncathedral would be granted an indulgence. Although in theory an \nindulgence was only a remission of penalties meted out in this world \nby the church, in practice it was hawked as if it covered the actual \nguilt of sins and could release souls from Purgatory. The gist of the \nindulgence was as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...[I] absolve you ...from all thy sins, transgressions, and \nexcesses, how enormous soever they be...and remit to you all \npunishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account and I \nrestore you...to the innocence and purity which you possessed at \nbaptism; so that when you die the gates of punishment shall be \nshut... and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain \nin full force when you are at the point of death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent to preach the indulgence in Germany was a Dominican named \nTetzel. Tetzel got above himself in his promises, implying that the \nindulgence even covered the future sins which the buyer was now \nharboring in his heart. Frederick the Wise refused to allow the \nindulgence to be preached in his territory of Saxony, mostly because \nhe was reluctant to allow Saxon coin to leave his \nfinancially-depleted realm. Tetzel came as near the border of Saxony \nas he could. Folk from Wittenberg crossed over and bought the prized \npapers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterwards a few doubted the efficacy of the writs. They solicited \nthe opinion to a middle aged monk named Martin Luther. Luther refused \nto confirm their value. Instead, in an accepted tradition, he posted \ntheses for debate on the door of Wittenberg castle church where a \nlarge crowd was expected. The sequel is well known. From those \nninety-five theses the Reformation was born when Leo refused to see a \nproblem with the disgraceful sales.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H. Here I Stand.

    "title": "IN FAITH AND IN BATTLE, HE WOULD NOT BE MOVED",
    "words": "Stonewall Jackson  18241863)\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth in faith and in battle, he would not be moved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jonathan Jackson was as thorough a Christian as he was a \nsoldier. One writer decribed him: He lives by the New Testament and \nfights by the Old.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrphaned at age 6, Jackson grew up poor and uneducated in foster \nhomes. He entered West Point near the bottom of his class, but he \ngraduated seventeenth. The second lieutenant then served in the \nMexican-American War.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the war, while Jackson was in the occupation force, his \nsuperior challenged him to study Christianity. He did, all the while \nstruggling with intestinal problems. He wrote his sister that his \ndigestive problems were decreed by Heavens sovereign, as a \npunishment for my offenses against his Holy Laws and have probably \nbeen the instrument of turning me from the path of eternal death, to \nthat of everlasting life. He was baptized at age 25.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years later, his young wife and unborn child died, which \ndevastated him but ultimately strengthened his faith. He remarried, \nand his second wife, Mary Anna Morrison, lived until 1915. \u0014\n\u0014\nThough baptized an Episcopalian, Jackson became a Presbyterian, and \nhe was a noted tither to his home church. The Jackson family held \nprayers at seven A.M., and even servants were required to attend. \nJackson never waited for anyone, not even his wife, to begin prayers. \nFollowing breakfast, Jackson would leave for his teaching duties at \nVirginia Military Institute (where his students called him Tom Fool \nJackson). Jackson would return home for Bible study, which he did \nusing a commentary. \u0014\n\u0014\nJackson believed that slavery was ordained of God. Strict but kind \nwith his own slaves, he asked his wife to teach two slave boys to \nread. He even organized a Sabbath school for AfricanAmericans in \nLexington and taught a class for five or six years. My Heavenly \nFather has condescended to use me as an instrument in getting up a \nlarge Sabbath school for the negroes here, he wrote. He has greatly \nblessed it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn April 1861, Jackson prayed with his wife and his cadets, and then \nleft for Richmond to assume his command. At the Battle of Manassas in \nJuly 1861, he took a green infantry brigade and turned the tide of \nthe battle. During the fighting, Brigadier General Barnard E. Bee \ninstructed his men: There stands Jackson like a stone wall. Rally \nbehind the Virginians!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name stuck, and Stonewall Jackson soon became Lees right arm \nin battle. He daringly moved large numbers of men quickly (some say \ntoo recklessly). In one sixty-day period, his troops marched over six \nhundred miles and fought five major battles and numerous skirmishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis military prowess earned him the fear of northerners, who regarded \nhim as a species of demon, a fallen angel, and a coldblooded \nrascal. But Jackson never forgot where his abilities came from. \nAfter Lee commended his performance at Chancellorsville, Stonewall \nreplied: General Lee is very kind, but he should give the praise to \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the battlefield, Stonewall Jackson maintained his devotional life. \nAccording to historian John W. Schildt, His men saw him stumbling \nand falling over trees and rocks. They almost thought he had too much \nto drink. That was not the problem. He was praying with his eyes \nclosed while he walked.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing every victory, Jackson ordered his chaplains to hold \nthanksgiving services. He was known to ride through the camps \ndistributing tracts to his soldiers, and he often took part in his \ntroops religious meetings. Wrote Henry Kyd Douglas in I Rode with \nStonewall: And when he had reached the place of prayer, lo, the camp \nwas there. Bowed heads, bent knees, hats off, silence! Stonewall \nJackson was kneeling to the Lord of Hosts, in prayer for his people! \nSundays were generally a day of rest. Deacon Jackson, as his men \nsometimes called him, hated doing battle on Sunday. \u0014\n\u0014\nJackson was rigid and stern, and he fought intensely with his \nsubordinates. Some thought he was insane. But despite the way some \nwriters have portrayed him, Jackson was not a fanatic. Its simply \nthat, in one historians words, his primary interests were \nBiblical theology and Christian discipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of this, he could declare: My religious belief teaches me to \nfeel as safe in battle as in bed. God has fixed the time of my \ndeath. After being accidently shot by his own forces, he died on \nSunday, May 10, 1863. I always wanted to die on a Sunday, he said.\u0014",

    "words": "\"Is That All There Is?\"\u0014\n(originally by Dan Daniels)\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.\u0014\nI'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up\u0014\nIn his arms and raced through the burning building out to the \npavement.\u0014\nI stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go \nup in flames.\u0014\nAnd when it was all over I said to myself,\u0014\n\"Is that all there is to a fire?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIf that's all there is my friends\u0014\nThen let's keep dancing\u0014\nLet's break out the booze and have a ball\u0014\nIf that's all there is\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd when I was 12 years old, my daddy took me to a circus.\u0014\n\"The Greatest Show On Earth.\"\u0014\nThere were clowns and elephants and dancing bears.\u0014\nAnd a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.\u0014\nAnd as I sat there watching, I had the feeling that something was \nmissing.\u0014\nI don't know what, but when it was over,\u0014\nI said to myself,\u0014\n\"Is that all there is to a circus?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIf that's all there is my friends\u0014\nThen let's keep dancing\u0014\nLet's break out the booze and have a ball\u0014\nIf that's all there is\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then I fell in love, with the most wonderful boy in the world.\u0014\nWe would take long walks by the river\u0014\nOr just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes.\u0014\nWe were so very much in love.\u0014\nThen one day, he went away and I thought I'd die.\u0014\nBut I didn't.\u0014\nAnd when I didn't I said to myself,\u0014\n\"Is that all there is to love?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIf that's all there is my friends, \u0014\nthen let's keep dancing-\u0014\nLet's break out the booze and have a ball\u0014\nIf that's all there is\u0014\n\u0014\nI know what you must be saying to yourselves.\u0014\n\"If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it \nall?\"\u0014\nOh, no, not me.\u0014\nI'm in no hurry for that final disappointment.\u0014\n'Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,\u0014\nThat when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath\u0014\nI'll be saying to myself-\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIs that all there is?\u0014\nIf that's all there is my friends\u0014\nThen let's keep dancing\u0014\nLet's break out the booze and have a ball\u0014\nIf that's all there is\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lyrics of this song are written from the point of view of a \nperson who is disillusioned with events in life that are supposedly \nunique experiences. The singer tells of witnessing her family's house \non fire when she was a little girl, seeing the circus, and falling in \nlove for the first time. After each recital she expresses her \ndisappointment in the experience. She suggests that we \"break out the \nbooze and have a ball  if that's all there is\", instead of worrying \nabout life. She explains that she'll never kill herself either \nbecause she knows that death will be a disappointment as well. The \nverses of the song are spoken, rather than sung. Only the refrain of \nthe song is sung.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe song was inspired by the 1896 story Disillusionment \n(Enttuschung) by Thomas Mann. Jerry Leiber's wife Gaby Rodgers (ne \nGabrielle Rosenberg) was born in Germany, lived in the Netherlands. \nShe escaped ahead of the Nazis, and settled in Hollywood where she \nhad a brief film career in films noir. Gaby introduced Leiber to the \nworks of Thomas Mann. The narrator in Mann's story tells the same \nstories of when he was a child. A dramatic adaptation of Mann's story \nwas recorded by Erik Bauserfeld and Bernard Mayes; it was broadcast \non San Francisco radio station KPFA in 1964.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne difference between the story and the song is that the narrator in \nMann's story finally feels free when he sees the sea for the first \ntime and laments for a sea without a horizon. Most of the words used \nin the song's chorus are taken verbatim from the narrator's words in \nMann's story.\u0014",

    "words": "I Am Who I Am \nToday Because Of These People\u0014\n\u0014\nOct 10, 2016 \u0014\nAt Virginia Beach, Virginia \u0014\n\u0014\nYou shape me, guide me, love me, and endlessly support me\u0014\n\u0014\nI recently received the tremendous honor of \"Millennial on the Move\" \nfor Hampton Roads from CoVa BIZ Magazine. As I heard my name called \nand walked to receive the award, I couldn't help but see visions of \neveryone who has helped me. I wanted to scoop them all up, hug them \nendlessly and say \"thank you\" until I had not a single breath left, \nbut not all of them were present, and some of them have passed away. \nSo, I wanted to write this thank you letter to everyone who helped me \n- who stood beside me, who held my hand, who listened to me cry - to \nget me to this very spot in life. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Grandma & Granddaddy, \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the day I took my first breath, you have shown me limitless \nlove, but you also taught me valuable lessons. You taught me to do \nwhat I say I'll do. You taught me how to stand tall and how to walk \nthrough life with a solid foundation of strong values. You instilled \nwithin me a caring for my community, and taught me - by example - how \nto guide, develop, listen to, and help others. You taught me to be \nopen and available to the needs in my community, and you taught me \nhow to not fear public speaking, important meetings, and making \ndifficult decisions. You taught me strength but also softness. You \ntaught me eloquence and the importance of opportunities for people. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Mama, \u0014\n\u0014\nYou are my best friend, my true north, my business guru and so much \nmore. You taught me to always be prepared, to think ahead, to pace \nmyself and to focus on what is important. I remember being a little \ngirl and having to walk out on stage for a dance performance that was \nintimidating me. You'd pull me close and say, \"You can do it. I know \nyou can.\" But even beyond that, you'd provide me with a clear plan. \nYou'd say, \"Just go in there and...\" all of your valuable wisdom \npumped me up and then guided me. Still today, when I'm about to walk \nin and do something that intimidates me, I hear your voice: \"You can \ndo it. I know you can. Just go in there and...\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYou have watched me succeed and fail. You have seen the best \nqualities of my personality and the absolute worst, but you always \npick up your phone or answer your e-mail. Your consistent love and \nguidance has shaped me. Period. It has created every shape of me, and \nfor that I am endlessly thankful. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Dad,\u0014\n\u0014\nWatching you work hard all of your life showed me how to work hard. \nWatching you help others on their own personal projects, or helping \npeople get their cars stuck from piles of snow, taught me to never \njust walk by or away from someone in need. Your tenacity, your humor, \nyour capacity to care are tools that I keep in my own toolbox as I \napproach the world each day.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Aunts, Uncles, Cousins (all of you people!),\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the first time I asked you to purchase a tin of popcorn, or \ndoughnuts, or candles, or whatever fundraiser I was trying to push, \nyou have been there to support me. You listen to my dreams, you sit \nand talk through plans with me, you hug me, and you support me \ndigitally while we're all living lives in different cities. Your \npresence is a deeply imbedded part of who I am and the work that I \ndo. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Boyfriend, \u0014\n\u0014\nYou listen to my good days and my bad days. You hear my stresses and \ncarry them without hesitation. Your strengths are different from my \nown, and you're always willing to lend your strengths to me when I \nneed them. You help facilitate my dreams, and then stand right beside \nme to watch them come true. You are so special to me. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear First Dance Teacher, \u0014\n\u0014\nI was just a small child when I came to you. I knew nothing of dance \nor anatomy or choreography. I just wanted to run around, wild and \nfree. Still today, I am running around wild and free because you \ntaught me how to do that gracefully. Your passion, your \ninquisitiveness for the world around you was contagious and reached \nevery cell within me. Your passion for teaching - and teaching well - \nleft an impression on me, but mostly, you taught me to move happily. \nI remember this each day; I promise to keep moving happily; to \nmaintain my own inspiration to be able to inspire others. Thank you \nfor passing your passion along to me. I was able to develop my own \nbecause I saw how powerful life can be with it. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Girlfriends, \u0014\n\u0014\nYou listen to my chaos over cups of coffee and glasses of wine! You \nlaugh at my stories; you let me cry; you keep me focused; you tell me \nwhen an idea won't work; you stand behind me full force when I move \nforward on an idea (even if you don't know it'll work). You all are \nso inspiring to me individually, and your lives inspire me to keep \ngoing with my goals. Thank you for always being a text message, call \nor click away. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Students, \u0014\n\u0014\nI learn from you every day. Even if you're a 4-year-old ballerina \njust starting your journey, or a 19-year-old college student, or a \n99-year-old student wanting to learn ballet: I learn from you. You \nhave taught me how to be a better communicator, stronger person, and \nmore open heart. Learning is such a precious thing, and I'm so \nhonored to be on that journey with you all every day. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Facebook & Instagram Friends, \u0014\n\u0014\nI may or may not be close to you, but your encouragement makes me \nsmile. I feel your presence and support, and it's special to me. I \nalso thank you for serving as a source of inspiration and motivation \nfor me. Your posts make me think new thoughts, and I enjoy your role \nin my life. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Past Jobs & Schools, \u0014\n\u0014\nThank you for the requirements you set on me. You taught me how to be \na professional. You taught me to respect deadlines, to think outside \nof the box, to be innovative in my problem solving. You taught me how \nto take pride in my work, prepare adequately, and leave no detail \nbehind. You pushed me to be better and then pushed me a little \nfurther than I felt ready for; I am thankful for that. You helped me \nset goals and then guided me to accomplish them. \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Mentors, \u0014\n\u0014\nI observe you and learn by your example. Thank you for your guidance, \nyour \"tips for success,\" your e-mails with bullet points of \nsuggestions. All of this helps me, collects my thoughts, and \nclarifies my visions. \u0014\n\u0014\nI could continue this list on and on, and why? Because I am a \ncollection of all of these people. I am the product of their time, \nenergy and effort. These people are the puzzle pieces that make up my \nlife, my work, my passions and my goals. They are with me every step \nof the way - even if they aren't physically with me. They have left \nmarks on my life that I will never forget (and I hope I'll never \nforget). \u0014\n\u0014\nI love each and every one of you and the role you've played in my \nlife. I cannot thank you enough.\u0014",

    "words": "I am with her and her and her\u0014\n\u0014\nStarlette McNeill | October 26, 2016  Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, this is not a political endorsement. I am not implying that I \nwill vote for Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United \nStates or that you should. This is kind of a new revised version of \nher campaign slogan, Im with her.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than a commercial or a roundtable discussion, this commentary is \nan intentional documentation, a winess to what has been said after \nrecent admissions of sexual assault and nonconsensual advances by \nDonald Trump, the Republican Partys nominee for president of the \nUnited States and now after 11 women have stepped forward to claim \nthat they were violated in some way by him. I do not find it ironic \nthat they would raise their voices, that they would challenge the \nsocially constructed power of male privilege at the same time Clinton \nbecomes the first female presidential nominee of a major political \nparty.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will not repeat the disgusting language that was used by a then 59- \nyear-old Trump and which initially was described as locker room \ntalk. But I will say that sexual assault is not locker room talk \nunless the violation of women is a sport. What is the name of that \nteam? Who is the coach, who is selling tickets to this display of \nsexual oppression and who are the sponsors?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd before we get too far ahead of our progressive selves, I can \nremember hearing young men talk about their sexual exploits with \nwomen as scoring. But how many points do you get for rape? I have \nheard men talk about their sexual relationship with a woman like \nrounding the bases: first base, second base, third base. Who is \ncheering you on when you hit a home run?\u0014\n\u0014\nOr if that shoe doesnt fit, persons to include his wife, Melania, \ndescribe Trumps words as boys talk. Though nearing the age of \nretirement for most Americans, Trump is talked about as if a child. \nAnd it is more than talk; its said he is just doing what boys do. It \nis what boys need to do: to conquer, to pillage, to exploit. It is \nwhat we must allow and expect from boys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoys will be boys, right? Boys will be attackers and rapists, \nright? It is a pass and an admission that we will defend the \ninnocence of men but not protect the innocence of women. This boys \nwill be boys mentality excuses criminality, downplays violence \nagainst women and abandons accountability. It is kind a hall pass to \nroam the world and to grab any woman caught in the act of walking, \njogging, dancing, serving, working.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd isnt October supposed to be Domestic Violence Awareness month? \nIt seems that we will need to do more than put it on our calendars. \nAccording to RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network), every \ntwo minutes someone is sexually assaulted in the United States and on \naverage, there are 288,820 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and \nsexual assault every year.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Melanias interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, she questioned \nthe legitimacy of the womens claims of sexual misconduct by her \nhusband. Sadly, this is often the response of women. We are our \nbrothers keeper but not our sisters.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is no wonder then that women dont tell, why they dont report \nthat they have been raped. Because no matter what is said, we are not \nwith her. She wanted it. She asked for it. She dressed for it. She \ndid not say, No loud enough or often enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nWay more often than not, we are with him. Dont get him into \ntrouble. Be a good girl. We aid and abet him, repeating after her \nassaulter, Dont tell anybody. Maybe this is why RAINN reports that \nonly six out of every 1,000 rapists will end up in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are sacrificed on a regular basis on the altars of patriarchy, \nmale bravado and chauvinism. Her body doesnt matter. Instead, it is \nhis reputation, his future, his career and his family that we are \nworried about.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen also dont tell because of the intimate nature of the crime. \nAnd because we dont talk about it, she will have great difficulty \nfinding the words to explain what has happened to her. It is a \nviolation for which she will bear the scars for the rest of her life. \nIt is a touch that cannot be washed off, a wound that never \ncompletely heals. No fundraisers, no T-shirts, no ribbons or \nmarathons apply here; there is no cure for this. There is no getting \nover or around it for she will have difficulty feeling safe in her \nown body  because he will always be there.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, while we are looking for ways to justify the violation and theft \nof what is sacred, pure and belonging first to her, while we continue \nto manipulate Scriptures in order to silence her, when she comes \nforward, I will stand behind her. I will cheer her on. I will affirm \nher voice and be a witness to her testimony.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am with her and her and her because I am her.\u0014",

    "title": "INTERPRETIVE SCHEMES OF REVELATION",
    "words": "Interpretative Schemes of Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nFour traditional ways of understanding Revelation 422 have emerged \nin the history of the church. In our day, additional mixed views have \nbeen developed by combining elements from these four traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\na. Futurist\u0014\n\u0014\nThis view is that, with the exception of chapters 1 to 3, all the \nvisions in Revelation relate to a period immediately preceding and \nfollowing the second advent of Christ at the end of the age. \nTherefore, the seals, trumpets, and bowls refer to events still in \nthe future; the beasts of chapters 13 and 17 are identified with the \nfuture Antichrist, who will appear at the last moment in world \nhistory and will be defeated by Christ in his second coming to judge \nthe world and to establish his earthly millennial kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nVariations of this view were held by the earliest expositors, such as \nJustin Martyr (d.165), Irenaeus (d. c. 195), Hippolytus (d.236), and \nVictorinus (d. c. 303). After nearly a ten-century eclipse, during \nwhich time the allegorical method prevailed, the futurist view was \nrevived in the late sixteenth century by Franciscus Ribeira, a \nSpanish Jesuit. He held that the beast was the Antichrist of the end \ntime and that Babylon was not Rome under papal rule but a degenerate \nRome of a future age. Unlike many modern futurists, Ribeira founded \nhis views on a thorough appreciation of the historical backgrounds of \nRevelation and its language. Thus he understood the first five seals \nto depict various elements of early Christianity. The white horse was \nthe apostolic age; the red, the early persecutors; the black, \nheresies; the pale, the violent persecutions by Trajan. But when \nRibeira came to the sixth seal, he took this to indicate the signs \nthat would precede the return of Christ; he also understood the seven \ntrumpets and seven bowls to follow the three and a half years. This \nfuturist approach to the book has enjoyed a revival of no small \nproportion since the nineteenth century and is widely held among \nevangelicals today. The chief problem with it is that it seems to \nmake all but the first three chapters of Revelation irrelevant to the \ncontemporary church. This objection is pressed more strongly when \nadherents to the futurist view affirm, as many do today, that the \nchurch will be removed from the earth before the events described in \n6:1ff. occur.\u0014\nb. Historicist\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the word implies, this view centers on history and its continuity \nas seen in Revelation. It started with Joachim of Floris (d. 1202), a \nmonastic who claimed to have received on Easter night a special \nvision that revealed to him God's plan for the ages. He assigned a \nday-year value to the 1,260 days of the Apocalypse. In his scheme, \nthe book was a prophecy of the events of Western history from the \ntimes of the apostles (in some varieties, from the Creation) until \nJoachim's own time. A short time after his death, the Franciscans \nconsidered themselves the true Christians of his vision. They \ninterpreted Babylon not only as pagan Rome but also as papal Rome. In \nthe various schemes that developed as this method was applied to \nhistory, one element became common: the Antichrist and Babylon were \nconnected with Rome and the papacy. Later, Luther, Calvin, and other \nReformers came to adopt this view. That this approach does not enjoy \nmuch favor today is largely because of the lack of consensus as to \nthe historical identification it entails. The distinguished exegete \nHenry Alford (181071) held a guarded version of this view.\u0014\n\u0014\nc. Preterist\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to this view, Revelation is to be seen as related to what \nhappened in the time of the author; as to the time of its writing, it \nis a contemporary and imminent historical document. So the main \ncontents of Chapters 422 are viewed as describing events wholly \nlimited to John's own time. This approach identifies the book with \nthe Jewish apocalyptic method of producing tracts for the times to \nencourage faithfulness during intense persecution. The beasts of \nchapter 13 are identified respectively as imperial Rome and the \nimperial priesthood. This is the view held by a majority of \ncontemporary scholars, not a few of whom are identified with the \nliberal interpretation of Christianity. As a system, it did not \nappear till 1614, when a Spanish Jesuit named Alcasar developed its \nmain lines. Today some commentators argue that the events were \nimminent but not yet realized when John wrote; hence, they suggest an \nimminent historical view (so Caird). While they do not ignore the \nimportance of the historical setting, those who accept Revelation as \na book of genuine prophecy concerning events extending beyond the \nfirst six centuries are little attracted by this view.\u0014\n\u0014\nd. Idealist\u0014\n\u0014\nThis method of interpreting Revelation sees it as being basically \npoetical, symbolic, and spiritual in nature. Indeed, it is sometimes \ncalled the spiritualist viewnot, of course, in reference to the cult \nof spiritualism, but because it spiritualizes everything in the \nbook. Thus Revelation does not predict any specific historical events \nat all; on the contrary, it sets forth timeless truths concerning the \nbattle between good and evil that continues throughout the church \nage. As a system of interpretation, it is more recent than the three \nother schools and somewhat more difficult to distinguish from the \nearlier allegorizing approaches of the Alexandrians (Clement and \nOrigen). In general, the idealist view is marked by its refusal to \nidentify any of the images with specific future events, whether in \nthe history of the church or with regard to the end of all things. \nUndoubtedly, the book does reflect the great timeless realities of \nthe battle between God and Satan and of divine judgment; undoubtedly, \nit sees history as being ultimately in the hand of the Creator. But \ncertainly it also depicts the consummation of this battle and the \ntriumph of Christ in history through his coming in glory.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich view is the right one? Since there have been evangelicals who \nhave held to each of the four views, the issue is not that of \northodoxy but of interpretation. In recent years many expositors have \ncombined the stronger elements of the different views. The history of \nthe interpretation of Revelation should teach us to be open to fresh \napproaches to it, even when this attitude goes contrary to the \nprevailing interpretations. Nothing short of the careful exegesis of \nthe text uninhibited by prior dogmatic conclusions is required for \nthe fullest understanding of the Apocalypse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis commentary will pay close attention to the historical situation \nof first-century Christianity in its Judeo-Greco-Roman world setting. \nI do not, however, take the position that this emphasis necessarily \nleads to the conclusion that John's language and visions describe the \npolitical entities of imperial Rome or the imperial priesthood. Thus \nwe feel that the preterist and to a lesser extent the \npreterist-futurist's views are misled. On the other hand, we believe \nthat John is describing the final judgment and the physical, bodily \nreturn of Christ to the world. This means that in every age \nRevelation continues to encourage the church in persecution as well \nas to warn the church of the beast's satanically energized, \nmultifaceted deception. Its language describes the deeper realities \nof the conflict of Christ's sovereignty with satanic power rather \nthan the mere temporary historical-political entities, whether past \n(such as Rome) or future.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation may then be viewed, on the one hand, as an extended \ncommentary on Paul's statement in Ephesians 6:12: For our struggle \nis not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the \nauthorities, against the powers of the dark world and against the \nspiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. On the other hand, \nit also reveals the final judgment upon evil and the consummation of \nGod's kingdom in time and eternity.\u0014",

    "title": "INHERITING THE OBAMA ECONOMY -- FROM \"THE WEEK\"",
    "words": "\u0014\nPresident Obama is handing his successor a remarkable gift: \"an \neconomy that's \u0014\nthe envy of the world,\" said Ben White in Politico. com. The \nunemployment rate fell \u0014\nto 4.6 percent in November, \"the lowest level since August 2007.\" The \nstock market \u0014\nand u.s. home prices are at record highs, consumer spending and wages \nare both ris- \u0014\ning steadily, and the economy grew a better-than-expected 3.2 percent \nin the third quar- \u0014\nter. The situation couldn't be more different from the one Obama \ninherited when he \u0014\nmoved into the White House in the depths of the financial crisis-or \nfrom Donald \u0014\nTrump's campaign rhetoric about a U.S. economy suffering from high \nunemployment and stagnant growth. In fact, Trump will take office \nagainst the rosy backdrop of an \"Obama boom.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Presumably, our fact-agnostic president-elect will one day try to \ntake credit for all this,\" said Jordan Weissmann in Slate.com. Trump \nrepeatedly dismissed positive economic statistics in the \u0014\nrun-up to the election, but I get the feeling he's going to learn to \nlove them once he's in office. \"Assuming the U.S. is still sailing \nsmoothly a few months from now, there's no reason to assume \u0014\nwe won't be hearing about the glories of the Trump economy.\" Let's \nnot sugarcoat Obama's economic record, said Ray Keating in \nRealClearMatkets.com. Annual economic growth has averaged \u0014\na mere 2.1 percent since the recession ended in 2009, \"compared with \nthe historic average of 43 percent.\" As for the recent jobs report, \nthe unemployment rate dipped mostly because people \u0014\nstopped lookingfor work, not because they found new jobs. In reality, \nObama is \"handing over a badly underperforming economy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Of course, presidents are ultimately judged little by tJre economy \nthey inherit, and more about where it goes under their watch,\" said \nJosh Zumbrun in The Wall Street Journal. It's true that Trump will \ninherit one of the lowest unemployment rates for any U.S. president \ntaking office; going back to \u0014\n1960, only Richard NIXon and George W. Bush enjoyed lower rates \nbefore assuming the presidency. But that figure doesn't ten the \nentire story. For instance, Trump win have to address the growing \u0014\nnumber of working-age men who have dropped out of the workforce \nentirely. In the 1960s, just 2.7 per- \u0014\ncent of men ages 25 to 54 were outside the labor force; today, it's \n11.5 percent. And wages, while rising, grew just 2.1 percent over the \npast 12 months, \"the lowest figure on record for any Novem- \u0014\nber in which a new president was elected.\" \"The economy isn't \nperfect; it never is,\" said Neil Irwin in The New Yor; Times. But \nwith the unemployment rate finally back to where it was just before \nthe financial crisis hit, let's be glad that the economy has more or \nless healed \"from its trauma of the past \u0014\nnine years,\" That doesn't mean Trump won't muck everything up, said \nChris Matthews in Fortune.com.Right now, a recession doesn't seem \nlikely, but who knows what will happen if Trump \u0014\nimplements some of his more unorthodox economic proposals, .like \nscrapping free-trade deals or levying punishing tariffs on businesses \nthat move jobs out of the U.S. Trump might want to ttead \u0014\nlightly. All the data suggest he is \"one of the luckier \npresident-elects in recent memory. \u0014",

    "words": "If Something in the Bible Is Weird, It's Probably Important \u0014\n06 Jun 2017   Dr. Michael S. Heiser\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the things I enjoy telling people in conversations about Bible \nstudy is that if it's weird, it's important. Numbers 5:1131 \ncertainly qualifies in both respects. The strangeness of the passage \nis easily detectable, but only careful Bible study makes its \nimportance apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nNumbers 5:1131 describes a water ritual to determine the guilt or \ninnocence of a woman suspected of adultery. A husband is to bring the \nwife under suspicion to the priest, along with a required grain \noffering that will bring iniquity to remembrance. The priest in \nturn prepares a jar of water mixed with dust from the tabernacle \n(5:1617). To this mixture is added the curses against her written \nin a book (5:23). Either the curses were written and erased, so \nthat the erasures are swept into the water mixture, or the ink is \nwashed off into the water mixture. The woman is compelled to drink \nthe concoction after saying Amen, Amen in response to the priest's \ninvocation of blessing or cursing upon her, depending on her \ninnocence or guilt. If she is guilty, the ingested mixture will cause \npain and sterility; if there is no such reaction, she is deemed \ninnocent (5:2731).\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the instructions in Numbers 5 were given by God (5:11), the \nwater ordeal is a means of divination, whereby it is expected that \nGod will use the ritual to answer a question human beings cannot. \nThat the Israelites could use such divination comes as no surprise, \nas the high priest had the Urim and Thummim at his disposal, and \nvarious biblical characters utilize the casting of lots for \ndiscerning the mind of God on a matter (Josh 18:68; Prov 16:33; Acts \n1:26).\u0014\n\u0014\nWait: Isn't divination evil?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis passage provides a useful starting point for discussing why \nbiblical characters were permitted to practice divination at all, \nwhen elsewhere such methods are condemned (e.g., Deut 18:914). But \nlet's instead focus on one practical implication of this passage.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents of the Bible know that adultery was punishable by death in \nancient Israel (Lev 20:1011). Surprisingly, death is not the penalty \nfor the guilty woman in Numbers 5:1131. The normal word for adultery \nthe word used in connection with the death penaltydoes not occur in \nthis passage, further distancing it from being a capital crime. Why \nthese discrepancies?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer lies in the fact that the guilty woman was not discovered \nin the act of adultery (5:13). Since this is the case, the community \nand, particularly, the angry husband, is effectively prohibited by \nthe law of the water ordeal from taking matters into their own hands. \nThis would serve as a protection for women suspected of adultery, or \nwho might be the target of someone's animosity or jealousy. The point \nis that secret adultery can and will be punished only by God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002Dr. Michael S.

When the bishop confessed his faith in Christ, the emperor \nsent him in chains to Rome to die. The public spectacles were about \nto close when Ignatius arrived. He was hustled to the arena at once \nand thrown to two fierce lions who immediately devoured him. \nAccording to traditions, he died on this day, October 17, 107.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt no time did he try to escape his miserable death. On the contrary, \nwhile bound for Rome under armed guard, he wrote a letter to the \nchurch in the imperial capitol insisting that no one interfere with \nhis \"true sacrifice.\" There has to be an explanation for such an \nunlikely attitude. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere it is, in Ignatius's own words, given in a letter that he wrote \nto Smyrna while on his death march, \"...nearness to the sword is \nnearness to God; to be among the wild beasts is to be in the arms of \nGod; only let it be in the name of Jesus Christ. I endure all things \nthat I may suffer together with him, since he who became perfect man \nstrengthens me.\" What an attitude!\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was merely the outworking of the faith he had preached for many \nyears. \"We have not only to be called Christians, but to be \nChristians,\" he had written. To die for Christ, even if it meant \nbecoming a sport to bloodthirsty spectators, was to inherit eternal \nglory. Ignatius is notable because he was a disciple of John the \napostle. According to John Chrysostom, Peter himself appointed \nIgnatius to the see of Antioch where he was bishop for forty years. \nIgnatius was the earliest bishop whose writings speak of the church \nas \"catholic,\" meaning \"universal.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from and earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES--BOOK REVIEIW",
    "words": "In the summer of 1859 the Great Valley that included parts of \nPennsylvania and Virginia was filled with great prosperity. Two \ncounties in the great valley, Franklin in PA and Augusta in VA, had \nbright futures, crops were growing well, people could make a living \nwith a little hard work and times were good. Both counties in the \nGreat Valley were similar in landscape and agriculture. Augusta, \nunlike the Deep South, grew corn, wheat and grains as the major \ncrops, but like all southern areas held slaves. Franklin County was \nsimilar in most aspects except it was more populated and of course \nheld no slaves. It seemed like the sky was the limit for the \npotential of the young nation as a whole, however, therE lingered \nstrong feelings over sectional debates dealing with slavery and the \ninterpretation of the constitution between the North and the South. \nThe citizens that lived in these counties along the Mason-Dixon Line \nthought that conflict had to be resolved in order to maintain a \nstrong Union. People along the border had a strong feeling that life \nwould be better with compromise and Union than the brutal \nconsequences of life without.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the presence of Mine Enemies: The Civil War in the Heart of \nAmerica, 1859-1863 by Edward L. Ayers is a social history of life in \nthese two counties in the border states. The centers for population \nand transportation in each county were Chambersburg in PA and \nStaunton in VA, much of the story takes place in these towns. Ayers \nuses accounts in the local papers as well as letters and diaries of \nthe citizens of the Franklin and Augusta to tell the story of what \nlife would be like there. The story starts out with the 4th of July \ncelebrations in each county and ends just prior to the Battle of \nGettysburg. The book is broken down into four sections following the \ntwenty-third psalm along the lines that both sides held strong \nreligious beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nPartisan politics played an important role in the lives of \nindividuals in the counties of the sectional border. In the late \nsummer of 1859 the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglas came to \nChambersburg to speak. After the speaking engagement he actually met \nwith another famous abolitionist John Brown at a quarry outside of \ntown. John Brown tried to talk Douglas into joining his group to raid \nHarpers Ferry. Douglas declined and advised Brown to do otherwise. \nAfter John Browns raid the fallout drew heavy criticism from both \nAugusta and Franklin. The Democratic papers in Franklin along with \nthe papers in the south blamed the abolitionist Republicans for \ncreating people such as John Brown. This political turmoil continued \nto get worse until it all broke loose with the election of Lincoln. \nAlexander McClure a resident of Chambersburg was elected to the \nSenate at the same time and he was a major factor in helping Lincoln \ncarry Pennsylvania. Interesting enough Alexander McClure is the same \nguy who began publishing the Juniata Sentinel in my hometown, I get \nthat paper each week! McClure would become a senator and an important \npart of the Lincoln administration.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after the election of Lincoln the people of Augusta sent a few \nrepresentatives to the state convention, former whigs such as George \nBaylor and John Baldwin gave great speeches trying to save the Union. \nThe convention voted not to secede and you could sense a sigh of \nrelief in the people of Augusta. This relief was short lived however \nwith the attack on Fort Sumter and subsequent calling up of troops by \nLincoln. The change in the people of Virginia was drastic and swift \nthe state virtually seceded overnight. The people of Augusta felt \nlied to and betrayed by Lincoln and their support for the Confederacy \nwas very strong. The people of Augusta developed a \"war fever\" as \nthey began recruiting troops for an invasion by Lincoln's army. Large \nnumbers of men joined the Confederate army eager to fight and the \nwomen began sewing uniforms for the soldiers. John Imboden joined the \narmy and started a large Guerilla unit under the direction of \nStonewall Jackson. Will Baylor and Jed Hotchkiss also from Augusta \nsigned up as well. Will Baylor went on to become a captain in the \ninfamous \"Stonewall Brigade\", he was killed at the 2nd Bull Run and \nJed became a map maker for General Jackson and General Lee helping \nthem secure many victories early in the war.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this same time the people of Franklin could not believe their \nneighbors to the south seceded and the war fever broke out there as \nwell. Soldiers began massing with 5 regiments in Camp Slifer to the \nsouth of Chambersburg. It cannot be underestimated how eager both \nsides were to fight and how they underestimated the strength of the \nother side. People in Franklin joked about how short the war would \nbe, they that one or two battles would be all that was necessary to \nput down the rebellion and restore order to the Country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe start of the war brought the Battle of Bull Run, the resulting \nConfederate victory gave the citizens of Augusta great encouragement \nand the people of Franklin great despair. The democratic papers of \nFranklin County criticized Lincoln's army and said they were fighting \nfor the wrong reasons; the Republicans in turn blamed the Democrats \nfor Treason. The lull in the major action in late 1861 gave both \nsides time to think about what this war might become, but both sides \nbelieved that God was on their side.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith most of their men in the army and many Union troops massing in \nthe Northern Shenandoah Valley and North of Richmond the people of \nAugusta began feeling insecure. Things were looking very bleak in the \nwinter of 1861, while the men from Augusta were only 30 miles from \nhome they were camped out in the Alleghany Mountains. The letters \nthat the men wrote home told of the poor conditions and how they \nwished to be home. In these letters men described sickness and \nanticipation of a fight, the soldiers resented those men still at \nhome and thought them cowards for not joining the army. At the same \ntime these soldiers families were struggling to make ends meet at \nhome. In the spring of 1862 the men in the mountains wrote that they \nwere moving toward Richmond and families began to worry. To their \nsurprise however Jackson marched the troops onto trains and shipped \nthem all to Staunton. The people were very excited but noted that the \ntroops looked very ragged and beat. Although they rested a short time \nin Staunton General Jackson's troops began marching at a swift pace \nup the Shenandoah Valley. Jackson put together a large string to \nvictories in the valley ending at Winchester. During the same stretch \nof time Lee booted McCllelan away from Richmond in the 7 days Battle. \nMeanwhile back in Staunton the hospitals and graveyards were filling \nup with dead Confederate soldiers, some of them family members of the \npeople in Augusta.\u0014\n\u0014\nLee and Jackson's forces joined at 2nd Bull Run and gave the South \nanother victory. The forces then moved on to the bloodiest battle in \nthe war, Antietam, a Union victory and with it came the Emancipation \nProclamation by Lincoln. The people of Franklin County were thrilled \nto have a victory but wondered how close the Confederates had come to \nan invasion of Pennsylvania. Partisan politics once again took center \nstage, while the democratic papers of Franklin showed excitement at \nthe Union victory at Antietam; they displayed disgust at the \nproclamation by Lincoln. The upcoming local and state elections in \nthe North would prove that the Democrats were well liked in \nPennsylvania with many positions taken by them. It was a different \nsituation in the South, they no longer had a party system, it was \neveryone together against the North. The people of Augusta saw the \nEmancipation Proclamation as a Tyrannical move by Lincoln that \naffirmed their fears of a \"race\" war. Before the elections of 1862, \nJ.E.B. Stuart made a raid into Chambersburg with his 1200 cavalry. \nThis first Confederate raid into Chambersburg accomplished little \nexcept to show how slow McClellan's army was and gain lots of \nnewspaper coverage. The people of Chambersburg could do nothing as no \nmilitary men were stationed in the town at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother important victory for the Confederates came in the winter of \n1862 at Fredricksburg. This demoralized the Union soldiers but more \nimportantly it demoralized the people at home. The copperheads became \nmore involved in politics in Franklin County, and with democratic \nvictory in the elections it looked as if the North might divide \nitself. The South would have a great chance for a stop to the war and \npeace if the Republican party lost control. However, one Augusta \nresident, Joseph Waddell, wrote in his diary that \"while there is \ngrowing discontent in the North, it will only take a major victory, \nespecially the capture of Vicksburg to unite the North again.\" And \nwhile the South was happy with the victories and growing Northern \ndiscontent the truth was that the economy of the North was much \nbetter off than those of the South. The people living in Chambersburg \nhad a bountiful harvest in the fall of 1862; those farms of Northern \nVirginia had been decimated by both armies living off the land. With \nall of this going on the spring the Army of Northern Virginia was \ngoing hungry and living in poor conditions. One soldier wrote that \n\"in the morning we had beef steak, for lunch roast beef, and for \ndinner what was left from breakfast.\" With these dire conditions it \nis easy to see why Lee would want to live off the land and push on \ninto Pennsylvania where the harvests were bountiful. This book ends \nwith the Confederates raiding Chambersburg for a second time. While \nthe people noted the chivalry of the soldiers, they were appalled at \ntheir treatment of the black population. While in Chambersburg the \norders came through that major fighting was happening at Gettysburg \nand all forces should move there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book by Ayers is a look into what life may have been like living \nin Civil War times. The emotional rollercoaster must have been \ndifficult for many people to handle when times were so good years \nprior to the conflict. This book is very well researched with \nmaterial from both counties however, there is much more material here \nfor the southern side. The southern material uses newspapers but also \nhas a lot of letters and diaries of the citizens of Augusta. The \nnorthern material consists of mainly partisan newspapers, but shows \nthe political turmoil of the North rather well. These papers were \neven more partisan than Fox News or CNN, and they did not even try to \nhide that fact. Both instances give a great feeling of what the \ncitizens were dealing with on both sides. I would read this book \nagain and will read the next book in the series when it comes out. \nThe next book should pick up at Gettysburg and continue until \nreconstruction. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a Civil \nWar class specifically those students in the Franklin or Augusta \nCounty area.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething kept bothering me as I was reading the letters, diaries and \neditorials of apparently good, decent people of both sides of the \nconflict, and ultimately what I realized was that whatever one's \nopinion was, at that time, depended almost entirely on where one \nlived. There were no Union people in Augusta Co. VA after Fort Sumter \nand Lincoln's call for volunteers, and almost no one in favor of \nletting the South go in Franklin Co. PA.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's a riveting scene where the Confederates get into Pennsylvania \nand go sweeping through the wheat fields looking for hiding black \npeople, rounding them up and sending them back into slavery though \nknowing many of them were free blacks -- what appalled me was that to \nthe ordinary apparently decent people of the South like teachers and \nhousewives, this was OK. It was like the banality of the average \nperson doing evil in the Third Reich, obliviously. The scary thing is \nthat no matter how decent or intelligent a person might seem to be, \nif he lived in the South in 1860, he was going to favor a system of \ninhuman cruelty, and not be able to see it. I don't see how a person \ncan read a book like this and not regard his or her own political \nopinions without sobering humility. Am I unknowingly overlooking evil?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other amazing thing about this book is that it shows how wrong \nalmost everyone was about what the other side was intending. The \nSouth was amazed when the North considered firing on Fort Sumter an \nact of war. When Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers, the people in \nVirginia couldn't believe it. And when the North thought the \nrebellion would be suppressed with 90-day volunteers and that most \npeople in the South were really opposed to secession, they were \nequally as wrong. And it seems that the more violently opinions were \nexpressed, the more wrong they were. Another sobering lesson when we \nregard today's partisanship.\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the recent flood of Civil War books that I have read, In the \nPresence of Mine Enemies is the most original and compelling. Thats \nbecause, instead of the familiar territory of battles and famous \nmilitary and political characters, Ayers mines a selection of primary \nsources to depict how the war was viewed and experienced by the \ncommon people of a valley that straddled the borders of North and \nSouth. If you ever wanted to experience what it must have felt like \nto live through the war, without the benefit of foresight (or \nhindsight) as to it outcome, this is the book for you. True, the \ngeographic focus of the book is comparatively small, but the depth of \npenetration is profound.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe danger in writing this sort of book is of course that common \npeople can have rather common thought and speech. Hence a narrative \nregurgitating clichs and shallow political sentiment. But Ayers has \nenough critical tension with this project to restrain the impulse to \npatronize and preach lessons to the personalities of his narrative \n(or the contemporary reader). His empathy for the political dilemma \nof his personalities is genuine. These are people forced to make very \nhard ethical choices. It does put you in mind of the choices that had \nto be made by the average German during the rise of the Third Reich, \nor for that matter, during the recent era of our own war on terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat strikes me is that these people were provided a political \nrhetoric by their leaders that was (mostly) violently extremist and \nuncompromising. (Perhaps again an echo of our own era.) In the South \nparticularly people were driven to war fever with a romance of \nSouthern culture that clouded hard strategic judgment. Was a \npermanent Confederacy ever in the cards for the states that seceded? \nThe clear record of the political and economic progress of the United \nStates to that point was that slavery could not become a foundation \nfor the economy of a nation rapidly expanding and industrializing.\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nOur standard Civil War histories tell a reassuring story of the \ntriumph, in an inevitable conflict, of the dynamic, free-labor North \nover the traditional, slave-based South, vindicating the freedom \nprinciples built into the nation's foundations.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at the time, on the borderlands of Pennsylvania and Virginia, no \none expected war, and no one knew how it would turn out. The one \ncertainty was that any war between the states would be fought in \ntheir fields and streets.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdward L. Ayers gives us a different Civil War, built on an intimate \nscale. He charts the descent into war in the Great Valley spanning \nPennsylvania and Virginia. Connected by strong ties of every kind, \nincluding the tendrils of slavery, the people of this borderland \nsought alternatives to secession and war. When none remained, they \ntook up war with startling intensity. As this book relays with a \nvivid immediacy, it came to their doorsteps in hunger, disease, and \nmeasureless death. Ayers's Civil War emerges from the lives of \neveryday people as well as those who helped shape history?John Brown \nand Frederick Douglass, Lincoln, Jackson, and Lee. His story ends \nwith the valley ravaged, Lincoln's support fragmenting, and \nConfederate forces massing for a battle at Gettysburg.\u0014",

    "title": "ISAIAH 9:2-7",
    "words": "Isaiah 9: 2-7\u0014\n\u0014\nThe original setting of this passage is the geopolitics of the \nancient world in the eighth cen- \u0014\ntury BeE. To understand Isaiah 9:2-7, we need to pull back the camera \nand view this passage in \u0014\nits larger literary context. In Isaiah 7, we meet King Ahaz of Judah, \nwho was between a rock \u0014\nand a hard place. The \"rock,\" in this case, was Assyria, a major \nMesopotamian military power \u0014\nintent on dominating the region. The \"hard place\" was an \nanti-Assyrian coalition forged \u0014\nbetween King Rezin of Syria (Aram) and King Pekah of Israel \n(Ephraim), leaders of two small \u0014\nand weaker nations who considered that their only defense against the \nAssyrian powerhouse \u0014\nwas to combine forces in a military alliance. Rezin and Pekah wanted \nAhaz to join in, but \u0014\nwhen Ahaz hesitated, the two kings decided that a regime change was \nin order and attacked \u0014\nJudah, intending to depose Ahaz and to replace him with a compliant \npartner. \u0014\n\u0014\nAhaz now had two problems: the elephant of Assyria, who could roll \nover any moment \u0014\nand crush Judah, and the Syria-Israel coalition, which already had \nboots on the ground headed \u0014\ntoward Jerusalem. What should Ahaz do? Snuggle up to Assyria, or roll \nthe dice and join hands \u0014\nwith Syria and Israel, thus rattling Assyria's cage? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this anxious moment of political calculation, God sent the prophet \nIsaiah to inter- \u0014\ncept Ahaz as he walked out on one of the local Jerusalem roads \n(7:3ff.). God put a message in \u0014\nIsaiah's mouth for the king, essentially, \"Do not be afraid, Ahaz. \nSure, the soldiers of Rezin and \u0014\nPekah are on their way to Jerusalem, but this is no threat. These two \nlittle 'smoldering stumps' \u0014\naren't in charge of Judah; I am. I have made promises to Jerusalem \nand to God's people, and \u0014\nI will keep them. Stand firm in your faith.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThen Isaiah added, \"If you doubt God's promise, ask God for a sign. \nMake it as big as you \u0014\nneed. As high as heaven or as deep as the underworld. Just ask.\" As \nif Ahaz did not already have \u0014\nenough problems, he now had one more: God. What if Ahaz asked for \nsome really big sign, and \u0014\nGod gave it? Then what? Ahaz would have to decide whether to trust \nGod in the rough-and- \u0014\ntumble world of politics or to trust his own wits  and finesse. \nTrusting God was perhaps all right \u0014\nfor priests and prophets and little people, but kings had to stand on \nfirmer realities; so Ahaz \u0014\ntried to wriggle free by answering Isaiah with fake piety: \"Oh no, I \nwould never put God to \u0014\nthe test.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah responded sharply, \"You tiresome idiot! OK, you won't ask for \na sign, but God will \u0014\ngive you one anyway!\" What was this sign that was higher than heaven \nand deeper than the \u0014\ndeepest pit? A baby. \"Look,\" said the prophet, \"a young woman is with \nchild, shall bear a son, \u0014\nand shall name him Immanuel.\" In a world bristling with power and \narmies on the march with \u0014\nswords at the ready, the sign of God's promise of peace is that most \nfragile and vulnerable of \u0014\nhuman realities, a pregnant woman and her soon-to-be-born child. \u0014\n\u0014\nRolling forward to our passage, this promised child has now been \nborn, and, as promised, \u0014\nthe child is indeed Immanuel, \"God with Us.\" Historically, Isaiah \n9:2-7, describing a newborn \u0014\nwho would become the \"prince of peace,\" may have begun as a royal \ncoronation hymn or, more \u0014\nlikely, as a poetic birth announcement for a new prince; but here in \nIsaiah these words have \u0014\nalready begun their migration into something broader, a joyous \nproclamation of God's endur- \u0014\ning intention to save God's people in distress. The passage opens \nwith a contrast between \u0014\ndarkness and light (9:2). At one level, this darkness is the gloom of \na nation in turmoil. King \u0014\nAhaz turned his back on the God of life and the hope that only God \ncan give (God was \"hiding \u0014\nhis face\" in 8:17). Panicked about security, food, and the economy, \nthe people see only misery \u0014\nall around them (8:20-22). For wisdom, they desperately reach out to \nfalse prophets-to nec- \u0014\nromancers or, perhaps for us, to pollsters, blathering pundits, and \ntalk-show hosts (8: 19)-but \u0014\nthe darkness descends all around them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt another level, though, this darkness is larger than one moment in \nhistory. Darkness \u0014\nrepresents the power of death and the disease, destruction, and decay \nthreatening God's good \u0014\ncreation. This power has shown up in the reign of Ahaz, but it keeps \nshowing up-whenever \u0014\nmilitary aggression is chosen over peace, whenever illness destroys \nhope, whenever fear over- \u0014\ncomes faith, whenever death loudly boasts of another victim. The good \nnews proclaimed by \u0014\nIsaiah is that God will not abandon God's people to the darkness; God \nis at work to overcome \u0014\ndeath and to bring wisdom, peace, justice, and righteousness, in ways \nas hidden and seemingly \u0014\nas weak as a newborn child. In the darkness, a light has shined. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo images describe the newfound joy of the people (8:3). First, the \npeople rejoice as they do \u0014\nat harvest time. Barren fields now burst forth with new life. Second, \nthe people celebrate like \u0014\nvictorious soldiers dividing plunder-a harsh, militaristic image, \nperhaps, but remember, the \u0014\nplundered enemy is death. Every child of God that death has claimed, \nevery hope that death \u0014\nhas dashed, is redeemed by the power of God. Isaiah 9:4-5 is \nrhythmic, even dance-like \u0014\n(indeed, some commentators argue this is the liturgy for a performed \nvictory ritual). One by \u0014\none, the symbols of oppression-the rods, the boots of the enemy, the \nbloody uniforms-are \u0014\nbrought forward and tossed on a fire, burning up the tools of evil. \nFinally, the promised \u0014\nchild is pictured as a grown-up and majestic king. The language is \nDavidic, but it transcends \u0014\nany earthly king, even David. The child will be strong and \nauthoritative, bringing wisdom, \u0014\npower, and endless peace. He will rule with justice and righteousness \nbecause \"the LORD of \u0014\nhosts\" is zealous to uphold him (9:7).\u0014",

    "title": "IS AMERICA A CHRISTIAN NATION?",
    "words": "Is America Christian? Our History Says No\u0014\nBy Richard Wilson\u0014\n|\u0014\nNovember 15, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a Christian America is deeply entrenched in a broad \nsegment of citizens of the United States.\u0014\nWhere the does the notion arise and can it be supported?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a matter of history, the idea of a Christian America is the \nproduct of the merging of three very different periods spanning 150 \nyears leading up to the Revolutionary War.\u0014\n\u0014\nProponents of a Christian America fail to separate the contexts of \nthe Puritan settlement of New England in the mid-17th century, the \nrevivalism associated with the Great Awakening in the mid-18th \ncentury and the philosophical movement among the likes of Thomas \nJefferson and Benjamin Franklin in the late 18th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the earliest colonists to arrive in North America were Puritans \nwho fled persecution from the Church of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the beginning of their adventure in the new world, these \nPuritans cultivated the conviction that New England was nothing less \nthan Gods New Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn part, they supported their convictions with a creative reading of \nIsaiahs many references to the coastlands (see Isaiah 41 and 42, \nfor example, especially Isaiah 42:4, and the coastlands wait for his \n[the servant of the Lords] teaching).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most famous of the Puritan settlers in New England were Increase \nMather and his son, Cotton.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe elder Mather made his mark in colonial America as the first \npresident of Harvard and his progressive attitude of working with \ndiverse segments of the Massachusetts colony.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe younger Mather is best remembered for his expansive history of \nAmerica, Magnalia Christi Americana.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Mathers work was in part an attempt to revive the Puritan \nexperiment and influence in New England, which had waned by the end \nof the 17th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 18th century, a new wave of religious consciousness swept the \ncolonies. The Great Awakening spread westward and southward out of \nNew England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Northeast, Jonathan Edwards  a Puritan  developed a \nfollowing, pressing hard for an active pietism among those who \nresponded to the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the middle states and into the South, George Whitfield  an \nArminian  made great gains as a revivalist.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven John Wesley conducted a preaching mission in Georgia, promoting \nthe Arminian theology of the emerging Methodist church. The Christian \nchurch increased in its influence and, in the process, fanned the \nfires of freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nArguably the enthusiasm of the Great Awakening and its insistence \nupon personal accountability fueled a growing impetus toward freedom \nin the colonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of the 18th century, a thoroughly philosophical movement \nemerged in the colonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nBritish political philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke tried to \nsort out implications of the Protestant Reformation and the recent \nrevolution in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding on their musings, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin  \namong others  articulated a vision of government rooted in natural \nlaw.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere Jefferson and Franklin and others religious? Without a doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were deeply committed to confessions that by nature human \nbeings had broad rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeffersons words in the Declaration of Independence  We hold these \ntruths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they \nare endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that \namong these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness  are \nconsistent with the passions and persuasions of Deists at the end of \nthe 18th century and the beginnings of the 19th.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeists believed that the Creator had forged a universe founded upon \nlaw that governed all things, including the natural and political \narenas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere Jefferson and Franklin Christians? Absolutely not.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson was attracted to the moral teachings of Jesus, but he \nrejected all of the claims of the New Testament concerning the \ndivinity of Christ and his power to work miracles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jefferson Bible makes clear that Jefferson could not be counted \namong Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin likewise rejected the orthodox Christian teaching. Franklin \nthought that Jesus of Nazareth was a good philosopher, but he also \nbelieved the Jesus story had been perverted by superstition and \nlegend.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin flatly rejected claims that Jesus was the Son of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a Christian America depends on a particular reading of \nhistory. Those who collapse the influences of Puritan colonists, \nGreat Awakening revivalists and Enlightenment philosophers into a \nsingle reality find evidence of a Christian America.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, those who see those features of American history \nas contiguous rather than continuous have good reasons not to claim \nthat America is rooted in Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA careful reading of history will demonstrate that the idea of a \nChristian America cannot be supported.\u0014\n\u0014\nA generation ago, Reinhold Niebuhr cautioned against investing \nChristian values in any social or political institution. Niebuhr \nsaid that the best one can hope for is the presence of Christians \namid the political establishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly then, he wrote, is there hope that the gospel might transform \nthe system.\u0014",

I didnt know why. \u0014\nI watched all of my friends get married, get bridal showered, get \ntipsy on bachelorettes, and eventually get married and, still, it all \nfelt so designated for other people. My role? Be the friend, the \nbridesmaid, the wedding guest.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter my breakup and moving off the boat, I felt even more strongly \nthat marriage wasnt happening for me, and I settled into that idea. \nI nuzzled up to being the strong, single, childless woman and I was \ngood right there! \u0014\n\u0014\nAs I sat curled up - completely content - by myself, I noticed other \nthings, silently at first, coming to sit by me: a healed heart, a \nnew-found self-confidence, a decade-long friend who kept showing up \nand showering me with, what was it exactly, care?

And that could include the \noff-limits idea of marriage or not, I didnt need that to know: Im \nalive and capable of giving and receiving love, still, today, always! \u0014\n\u0014\nAll I texted Stephen back was, Yes, Im alive but barely. But I \nrolled back over into my nap with a smile on my face. \u0014\n\u0014\nSomething was happening.

    "words": "Sacrifice \u0014\n\u0014\nOne day in the late 1870s four men rode up to the door of a farmhouse \nin the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. When they knocked on the \ndoor a poor widow answered. They explained that they were traveling \nthrough that country and were extremely hungry. They wondered if the \nlady would prepare them a hot meal. Although hesitant at first the \nwoman agreed, after all they did look hungry and were very polite. \u0014\n\u0014\nInside, the four men realized just how poor the woman was, her \ncupboards were bare and her belongings were quite meager. As time \nwent on the woman shared that at 4:00 that afternoon she was going to \nbe evicted. She owed $800 on her mortgage and was unable to pay. The \nman who held the mortgage on her farm was coming to collect or put \noff the place at 4:00. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore leaving the men gave the woman $800 and told her to get a \nreceipt when she paid off her mortgage. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the man left her farm with the $800 mortgage payment, he was \nrobbed on his way back to town. It seems that the robber was the man \nwho had given the widow the money in the first place, the famous bank \nrobber - Jesse James. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesse James' gift was no gift at all. It cost him nothing. Christian \ngiving that costs us nothing is not giving at all, either. -Rick \nDanielson\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSenior Adults\u0014\n\u0014\nJack Nicklaus' victory in the Master's Golf Tournament several years \nago is one of the most stunning memories I have of sport. It also \nreminds me of a lesson we need to learn. \u0014\n\u0014\nDon't be too quick to write yourself off. You still have the \npotential for victory. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the eyes of the world, Jack Nicklaus didn't really have a chance \nthat day. He was too old. It had been two years since he had won a \ntournament of any kind and over six years since he had won a major. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith only 10 holes to play, he was far in back of the leaders. The \nplayers who were ahead of him had too much ability to succumb to any \nkind of challenge he might offer. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut as you watched him play you caught sight of a man who refused to \nlisten to those who would write him off. He played some of the most \nbrilliant golf the world had seen. Years later the scene of him \nmaking the birdie putt on the 17th hole that gave him the lead is \nstill being replayed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a tendency at times to write ourselves off or to listen to \nthose who tell us that we're too old to do much. -Eddie Simmons\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSelf-examination\u0014\n\u0014\nH. Jackson Brown, Jr., of Nashville, Tennessee tells how he came to \nwrite the best seller, Life's Little Instruction Book. It began when \nhe realized he'd driven a wedge between himself and his 15-year-old \nson, Adam. After self-examination, he concluded he'd been too \ncritical, too demanding, too hot-tempered. But how to change? One day \nin downtown Nashville a sign jumped out at him: \"Closed for \nremodeling: Opening soon under new management.\" He immediately \ndetermined to \"remodel\" his own life. But how? A minister friend \nhelped by asking, \"What would Christ do?\" Applying this principle, he \nbegan to make changes in his life, restoring a healthy relationship \nwith his son. The principles he learned are in his popular book. \nExamining one's true self in a mirror can be a grueling experience. \nIt can also be one of the most rewarding. \u0014\n-Robert Hastings\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(All I Really Need to Know I Learned From) Noah's Ark \u0014\n1. Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark. \u0014\n2. Stay fit. When you're 600 years old, God might ask you to do \nsomething really big. \u0014\n3. Don't listen to critics-do what has to be done. \u0014\n4. Build on high ground.\u0014\n5. Speed isn't always an advantage. The cheetahs were on board, but \nso were snails. \u0014\n6. Remember: we're all in the same boat.\u0014\n7. When it gets really deep, don't sit there and complain-shovel!!!\u0014\n8. Stay below deck during the storm.\u0014\n9. Remember that the ark was built by amateurs and the Titanic was \nbuilt by professionals.\u0014\n10. If you have to start over, have a friend by your side.\u0014\n11. Remember that the woodpeckers inside are a bigger threat than the \nstorm outside.\u0014\n12. Don't miss the boat.\u0014\n13. No matter how bleak it looks, there's always a rainbow on the \nother side.\u0014\n14. Stop what youre doing, and do what God says!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people that value its privileges above its principles soon loses \nboth. - Dwight D. Eisenhower\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse freedom leaves a man free to do what he likes; true freedom, to \ndo what he ought.  Charles Kingsley\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGods Faithfulness\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the terrible bombing of London during World War II, many of \nthe citizens fled, seeking refuge elsewhere. The queen was asked if \nher little princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, would also leave \nEngland. She responded: \"The children will not leave unless I do. I \nshall not leave unless their father does, and the king will not leave \nthe country in any circumstances whatever.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nHabits \u0014\n\u0014\nLon Chaney, Sr. played the title role in the classic movie, The \nHunchback of Notre Dame (1923). He said that he had to strap himself \nin a harness and tie himself hunched over in order to look like a \ngenuine hunchback. As the days of the filming stretched into weeks, \nChaney found that the longer he stayed in the stooped position, the \nlonger he took to stand up straight. His body was getting used to \nbeing bent over. Beware of getting used to being out of church and \nout of the Lord's service. The longer you stay away, the harder it is \nto get back.

    "words": "Harmony -- Spiritual gifts\u0014\n\u0014\nA guitar has six strings. The guitarist uses combinations of these \nsix strings to play chords and notes. The chords and notes are \ncombined to form songs of different styles--country, rock, bluegrass, \nclassical, gospel, flamingo, blues, jazz, and others. One string out \nof tune can ruin the entire process. The skill of the guitarist is \nirrelevant if the guitar is out of tune.\u0014\n \u0014\nSo it is in a body of believers: Each has different gifts according \nto the working of the Holy Spirit. When these gifts work together, \nthey create marvelous harmony in God's work on earth. But if a \nbeliever or group of believers gets out of tune, the entire work is \nthreatened. Believers cannot allow differences and problems to spoil \nthe harmony of the body of Christ.  Rick Heson\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWise Sayings of ''Uncle Gideon'' to Preachers \u0014\n\u0014\nJ. B. Gambrell (1841-1921) was a unique man who had a unique way of \nsaying things, especially to preachers. He was affectionally known as \n\"Uncle Gideon. \" He taught preachers at Southwestern Baptist \nTheological Seminary for many years. His sayings, couched in a folksy \nstyle, were com-piled in a booklet by O. E. Bryant and published many \nyears ago by the Executive Board of the Tennessee Baptist Convention. \nPermission was given to use excerpts from it here. Thanks to J. \nLowell Ponder, retired preacher in Fayetteville, Arkansas, for \ndigging back in some old files and sharing this refreshing bit of \nmemorabilia with Proclaim readers. Times have changed since \"Uncle \nGideon\" spoke these words over fifty years ago, but these timeless \ntruths speak to every generation of preachers. -Jack Gulledge, EDITOR\u0014\n\u0014\nThe preacher is the man with the greatest task on earth, and the most \nurgent. \u0014\nNo preacher ever gets down in the mouth until he first gets down in \nhis heart. \u0014\nA preacher is undone if he doubts his message, either the truth of it \nor the power of it. \u0014\nNo man under the sun has as little time to gad about as the preacher. \u0014\nThere is no spot on earth where people live that a preacher may not \nfind all he can do. \u0014\nNo coward has any right to be a preacher. \u0014\nPeople will not follow a coward except in retreat. \u0014\nA long-tailed coat may cover a fool but it can never hide him. \u0014\nSome preachers take the edge off of the sword of truth by apologizing \nbefore they strike. \u0014\nI never could admire the dog with a noble voice that gave its nights \nto barking at crickets.\u0014\nIf you ever have a carbuncle, you will know where it is.\u0014\nOften a little tugboat makes more noise than a great steel liner. \u0014\nMud will rub off much easier when it is dry. \u0014\nThere is no harm in being ignorant  we are all born that way. The \nshame is remaining ignorant. \u0014\nWe should learn the fine art of plowing around stumps. \u0014\nThey will soon rot out if left alone. \u0014\nThe way to keep dogs from fighting is to get them after something \nlarge. \u0014\nI dont care if a preacher is green, so long as he doesnt shrink \nwith the green on him. \u0014\nNO pulpit ought to sound like a frog pond. People will not hear a \ncroaker long. They have sense. \u0014\nAny simpleton can prescribe spanking. It requires sympathy and \npatience, with motherly wisdom, to find the trouble behind the cry.\u0014\nAs a rule, green apples are not good for babies.\u0014\nThe masses are quick to know the spirit of a preacher.\u0014\nNo man is going to earn his salt as a preacher if he can't see higher \nthan circumstances and conditions.\u0014\nSpiritual cowardice is not only weakness, but it is wickedness.\u0014\nIt is not more harness we need, but / more horse.\u0014\nMore people, a hundred to one, will join in a bear hunt than will \nturn out to kill a mouse.\u0014\nA dog loses interest in the chase when he is not allowed to bark.\u0014\nSome Baptists are like eggs; they stay where you put them if the \nground is level, but if the ground slants, they go that way.\u0014\nNo preacher is profoundly intellectual in religion whose heart is not \nstirred with the sin of the world, the woes of humanity, and the \ninfinite love of Christ for lost souls.\u0014\nIn many a pulpit today is a cultured preacher fooling away his time \non labored, scholarly sermonettes which fall on the people as dead \nleaves of the forest under mid-winter frost.\u0014\nThe D.D. for a preacher is like the curl in a pig's tail, a little \nmore style but no more pig.\u0014\nPeople will not swallow what is dry. Paul was profoundly doctrinal, \nbut there was a pathos and a passion and love that glorified the \ndoctrine.\u0014\nThere are pastors who could lead, but because they are lazy or \nindifferent or absorbed in business, they scratch along in a low key \nand bring things to dullness and finally to do- nothing-ness.\u0014\nThe lazy preacher who dawdles around and gives time to all sorts of \nsilly functions is a disgrace to the ministry, a nice disgrace, to be \nsure, but a disgrace still, from the standpoint of Scripture and \nreason.\u0014\nOne good deacon is worth many poor preachers.\u0014\nIf some preachers will quit feeding the sheep on bitter weeds, they \nwill hear less bleating and it will be more pleasant to live around \nthe sheepfold.\u0014\nWhoever adopts the New Testament style will not have to change. He \nwill not need to change.\u0014\nThe preacher whose thoughts and efforts revolve around himself and \nhis church will circle in and come to a dead standstill at the center.\u0014\nThe life of a purposeless preacher is like a stream which, at first, \nmay run strong in the channel made by itself, but gradually slows up, \nbroadens out and loses itself in a waste of barren sands.\u0014\nSome men, if they lived in Ireland, where there are no snakes, would \nhave snakes shipped to them just for the sake of killing them.\u0014\nA dog barking at the moon is not a critic or astronomer either. He is \na howler. People who keep up a howl against things too high for them \nare no critics.\u0014\nThe thunderous once-a-year sermon on giving is about like starving a \ncow to a shadow, then giving her ten bushels of meal and a wagon load \nof hay at once, expecting to get a barrel of milk the next morning.\u0014\nA boy might throw a bomb that would wreck a building it would require \none hundred men a year to build.\u0014\nI take no comfort in the smooth, easy way of many churches and \npreachers in these latter times.\u0014\nThe imitative faculty is very strong in the human makeup, and it has \nits valuable points and its very weak points. It must be watched or \nit will make monkeys of us all. Many a man with poor equipment has \nled gloriously because of the consciousness of the power of Jesus in \nhis heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo coward has any right to be a preacher. If a preacher is afraid of \nanyone in his church, afraid to speak his mind or to do right, that \nman ought to pray himself out of that timid atmosphere or he ought to \nresign and go where he is not afraid.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt takes churning to get butter.\u0014\nHe who made the world is going to master it through the simple \npreaching of the gospel.\u0014",

    "words": "Anger\u0014\n\u0014\nAnger plagues us all. Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"When angry, count to 10\u0014\nbefore you speak; if very angry, 100.'' Buying time in a situation \nthat angers you allows you to remember the times when you blew up and \naccomplished nothing; to remember how out-of-control, embarrassed, \nand exhausted you felt; to remember others' reactions to your \nanger-their fear, pain, and disgust. 1 Proverbs14:29 states a great \ntruth: \"A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered \nman displays folly\" (NIV).\u0014\n--Keith Durso\u0014\n\u0014\nArrogance \u0014\n\u0014\nOn February 20, 1755, Edward Braddock arrived in Virginia as \ncommander in chief of British forces in America. War with France was \non. His task against the French was simple, or so he thought: He told \nBenjamin Franklin that after taking Fort Duquesne, in two or three \ndays he would proceed to capture the French fort at Niagara, and if \nwinter did not come too soon, he would take Frontenac as well. It all \nsounded so easy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin cautioned Braddock about the danger of ambushes from the \nIndians along the nearly four-mile-long line. Braddock replied, \n\"These savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw American \nmilitia, but upon the King's regular and disciplined troops, sir, it \nis impossible they should make any impression.\" Even George \nWashington, Braddock's aide-de-camp, found reasoning with the general \nuseless.  Braddock refused to take defensive measures and fight the \nCanadian French and their Indian allies as they should be fought. At \nabout 10 o'clock on the morning of July 8, 1775, the British forces \nwere attacked near present-day Pittsburgh. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe battle was a rout. The British took 977 casualties out of l,469 \ntroops. Braddock was mortally wounded and died a few days later. The \nheaviest losses were to the Virginia Militia under George \nWashington's command. Only 30 men out of three American companies \nsurvived.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBible\u0014\n\u0014\nA minister friend  once met Jesse James and questioned him about his \nwayward life. He reminded Jesse that he used to read his Bible, \nwhereupon the outlaw thrust his hand into his inside coat pocket and \nproduced a New Testament. The minister looked through the book in \nastonishment. He later said that never in his life had he seen a \nTestament so marked up showing constant use.\u0014\n-Lee Roy David\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBlame \u0014\n\u0014\nDennis the Menace, in his prayers one night, was talking to God about \nthe latest problem he had been in. He said, \"God, it wasn't really my \nfault, but I guess you hear that all the time.\"  Brian L Harbour\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCommunication\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslating one language into another is sometimes a risky task. Not \nonly the words but the meaning must be translated accurately. \nPresident Carter set up a Commission on Foreign Languages and \nInternational Studies to determine how translating from our language \nto another is affecting our country's standing abroad. \u0014\nEvidently, an investigation is needed. For example, some car \ninteriors marked \"Body by Fisher\" came across in some foreign markets \nas \"Corpses by Fisher.\" When Pepsi was introduced into Taiwan, its \nslogan \"Come Alive\" was translated in Chinese, \"Pepsi brings your \nancestors back from the grave.\"\u0014\nPersons today need to understand who God is and what he means to our \nlives. God in Christ translated the meaning of himself for us, \"The \nWord became flesh, and dwelt among us\" (John J:14). -H. Joseph Blair\u0014\n\u0014\nDiscouragement\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid those alluring attractions for which San Francisco is famous, \none stands supreme-the Golden Gate Bridge, truly one of the most \nmonumental engineering feats of all time. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis bridge is known for its tremendous towers, its sweeping cables, \nand its graceful span of 4200 feet. Constructed at a cost of 35 \nmillion dollars, it would now cost upwards of a half billion dollars \nto replace today. More than 100 thousand cars a day bring in 7 \nmillion dollars in tolls annually. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than twenty years the vision of a bridge across the swirling \nwaters of the Golden Gate lived in the mind and heart of Joseph B. \nStrauss, poet, dreamer, philosopher, engineer, and achiever \nextraordinary. He slept with it, ate with it, and worked with it. \nBridging a mile-wide cleft in the Pacific coastline was regarded \nimpossible, a problem utterly insoluble. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat mile-wide cleft, through which the Pacific Ocean pours into the \nbay at San Francisco in turbulent ebb and flow of deep water, was to \nengineer Strauss an irresistible challenge. On January 5, 1933 \nconstruction began while weeping Jeremiahs wailed, \"It can't be \ndone!\" Never allowing himself to become discouraged by problems, \nsetbacks, and difficulties, the bridge that couldn't be built was \nformally complete and opened to traffic on May 27, 1937. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sensational appeal of Golden Gate Bridge lies in two suspension \ncables, supporting a 4200-foot span of six-lane highway, each \nsuspending the weight of 123 million pounds. Those two cables pass \nover the tops of the towers, terminating in massive blocks of \nconcrete on shore. Thirty- six-and-one-half inches in diameter and \n7650 feet long, each cable contains 27,572 parallel bars the size of \na lead pencil. Because of the strength of those intertwined wires, \neach cable has an ultimate tensile strength of 200 million pounds. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust as the union of 27,572 wires comprise the strength of the \nmajestic Golden Gate Bridge, so you and I must be united in \ncommitment to a splendid performance. \u0014\n\u0014\nFanatics\u0014\nA secretary said to an irate boss who had just raked her over the \ncoals, \"Of course I can spell correctly, but I'm not a fanatic about \nit.\" We need more fanatics for Christians-those who will not change \ntheir mind and will not change the subject. -Brian L. Harbour\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIntegrity\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1804, a Kentucky Baptist congregation was split asunder because \nthey could not agree about the right thing to do in a hypothetical \nsituation. Someone proposed for discussion the moral question of \nwhether a man, when captured by the Indians, was justified in lying \nto protect his family concealed nearby. Some declared that under such \ncircumstances the man had a duty to lie while others maintained that \nhe should tell the truth even if it meant the sacrifice of his \nfamily. The argument was so vehement that the church split into two \ncongregations known as the Lying Baptists and the Truthful Baptists. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe application of Christian principles to life situations is not \nalways a simple consideration. Each individual must diligently search \nGod's Word for guidance and depend heavily on the Holy Spirit for \nstrength to maintain his integrity before God and man.  Lee Roy Davis\u0014\n\u0014\nMissons\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a missionary has nothing to do with geography. A missionary is \nnot someone who lives outside the boundaries of his own country for \nChrist, but someone who lives outside the boundaries of his own self \nfor Christ. - Bob Dixon\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery heart with Christ is a missionary and every heart without \nChrist is a mission field. - Dick Hillis\u0014",

Josh Billings \u0014\n\u0014\nThe surest way to go broke is to sit and wait for a break. \u0014\n\u0014\nMan must work. That is certain as the sun. But he may work grudgingly \nor he may work gratefully; he may work as a man, or he may work as a \nmachine.

It is the open \nsesame to every portal, the great equalizer, the philosopher's stove \nwhich transmutes all base metal of humanity into gold.

Charles Darrow proved that in the early thirties \nafter his invention of the Monopoly game which the commercial game \ncompanies refused to manufacture. Parker Brothers scoffed at his \ncreation. Their experts listed fifty-two major reasons why the game \nwould not sell. A few years passed. \u0014\nIn desperation Darrow finally produced his own homemade copies and \nconvinced Wanamaker's Department Store in Philadelphia to accept them \non a no-risk consignment. That was the Christmas of 1934. Monopoly \nbecame an instant sensation and caused an immediate memory loss among \nthe Parker experts. They forgot about those fifty-two errors and \nrushed into production! \u0014\n\u0014\nDarrow became a millionaire many times over.

Five \nminutes later the patient walked out minus his tooth. \u0014\nOf course, the patient first protested that the offending tooth might \nbe filled; but it was too late.

As \na result, Johnny dropped out of the class. He never returned. In less \nthan twenty years he was number one on the list of most wanted \ncriminals.

Maria's immediate response was to turn all that she had \nreceived over to the little band of Christians that they might build \ntheir church.

It is a \"freedom from.\" According to the \nnegative definition of freedom, a man or woman is free to the extent \nthat he or she can choose between alternatives, uncompelled to act in \naccordance with the will of another. Positive freedom is the inherent \nright to certain privileges and benefits. It is \"freedom for,\" \n\"freedom to,\" and \"freedom of.\" So we speak of freedom of speech, \nfreedom of association, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship. \nPhilosophical freedom is a wonderful thing, but there is a greater \nfreedom: the freedom from sin and self which only Christ can give. \n\"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free\" (John \n8:32).

When informed by prison officials that \nhe could solve his problems by dieting, Nichols responded that he \nwould not diet unless provided with the \"diet\" of his choice: fried \nfish or fried chicken daily. Though in prison, Nichols insists on his \n\"rights.\" Real freedom involves more than self-centered \"rights\" - \nthe freedom Christ gives frees from the greatest bondage of \nall-slavery to self!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you know how a Persian rug is woven? While it is being woven, the \nrug is stretched on a large vertical rack. The master weaver stands \non one side and his helpers, who do the actual weaving, stand on the \nother. All day they stay in those positions with the master weaver, \nthe artist, giving the directions for weaving and his helpers pulling \nthe wool and yarn. When a mistake is made, the master weaver doesn't \nnecessarily undo the error, but depending on his skill, he will \ncreate a new pattern around it. \u0014\n\u0014\nOften, the new pattern is more beautiful than the original. At the \nend of the day, the helpers go around to the master weaver's side \nwhere they see for the first time the pattern they wove rather than \nthe strands and ends of yarn which they saw all day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe grief process is like weaving the rug. When we are in the midst \nof the process, we are like the helpers doing the weaving who see \nonly the bits and strands of yam. On the other side is the Master \nWeaver, God, and He knows the beauty which will emerge. Joe E. Trull\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHope\u0014\n\u0014\nIn December 1980 I attended a conference led by Karl Menninger. To my \nsurprise, he spent his entire address talking about a simple Dutch \nwoman named Corrie Ten Boom. He felt that her ability to excise from \nher life the hostility caused by the irreparable damage done to her \nand her family by the Holocaust was the best hope for sanity in the \nworld. How could she forgive? How could she know that beyond the \nsurgery without anesthetic that true forgiveness always is inner \npeace and harmony with former enemies? She had to be convinced of the \noutcome of such forgiveness to attempt it. The answer: Jesus Christ \nhad forgiven her sins at the cost to Him of the cross. Having \nunderstood this and received His forgiveness, she could forgive her \nenemies and hold up such forgiveness as the hope of the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow ironic. A Galilean peasant whom two politicians passed back and \nforth like a pawn has become the human community's best hope, and in \nthese days maybe its last.  Fred McGehee\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJudgment\u0014\n\u0014\nKlaus Barbie was a German Gestapo officer who served in France during \nWorld War II. From 1942 to 1944, he was head of the Gestapo in Lyon, \nFrance, where he became known as the \"Butcher of Lyon.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOn two previous occasions in 1947 and again in 1954, Barbie was \ntried, convicted, and sentenced to death in absentia for his war \ncrimes against the French. Those crimes include the execution of four \nthousand people and the deportation of seven thousand French Jews to \nconcentration camps. They also include the torture and death of Jean \nMoulin, France's most revered Resistance leader, who is believed to \nhave died under Barbie's personal torture in 1943. Perhaps the most \npoignant and damning case against him is the deportation of forty-one \nJewish orphans, aged three to thirteen, from one French village to \nthe Auschwitz death camp. All in all, he is accused of numerous \natrocities against the French, having personally ordered the arrest, \ntorture, death, and deportation of thousands of Jews and Resistance \nfighters. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the victims of Barbie's tortures and imprisonments are still \nalive. They recall vividly his personal involvement in their torture \nand questioning by the Gestapo. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the war ended, Barbie fled Europe using Red Cross documents. In \n1951 he arrived in Bolivia, where he settled with his family. French \nofficials, who still actively search for Nazi war criminals, \ndiscovered his whereabouts several years ago and brought him back to \nFrance to face the charges against him. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is interesting to note that Barbie was not expelled from Bolivia \nbecause he is a war criminal. Bolivia does not have an extradition \ntreaty with France. Barbie was deported from Bolivia because he had \nused a false name, Klaus Altmann, to obtain Bolivian citizenship. \u0014\n\"Be sure your sin will find you out\" (Num. 32:23). -Isaac McDonald\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMaterialism\u0014\n\u0014\nA contemporary fable tells of two flies walking alongside a lovely \npiece of flypaper. \"What do you think of this invention called \n'Toughfoot'?\" said the younger to the older. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I am opposed to it,\" was the instant reply. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"How is that?\" asked the younger fly. \"I thought you were \nbroadminded. Is it poisonous?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No,\" replied the other. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it bitter?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No,\" came the reply again, \"it is rather sweet.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then what is your objection?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJust then a neighbor of theirs flew and set down right in the center \nof the paper. \"My objection,\" said the older fly, \"is just this: you \nwill never find our friend yonder in prayer meeting again. He thinks \nhe owns the flypaper, but the flypaper owns him!  Joe E. Trull\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPotential \u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, the World Press Review carried a quotation from the \nNational \u0014\nConcord of Lagos, Nigeria. That paper reported that twenty-six lakes \nhave been found beneath the Sahara desert. The American space shuttle \n\"Columbia\" determined by echoes it received that there are miles and \nmiles of underground rivers beneath that arid land. It is sad to \nthink of the people who are starving because those hidden resources \nhave not yet been tapped. \u0014\nWhat spiritual resources lie untapped in every congregation?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPriorities\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul Harvey reported that one of the first actions taken in the new \nyear by the Beruit, Lebanon, city administrators was the passing of a \nlaw against jaywalking. A dozen different war-ring factions with \nweapons in their hands, grenades on their belts, and explosives in \ntheir cars; scores of people killed and injured each week-and a law \nis passed against jaywalking, which city officials admittedly cannot \nenforce. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is reminiscent of some people whom Jesus once accused of \n\"straining at gnats and swallowing camels.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAwareness of such happenings in our world might serve as a reminder \nthat we too often occupy ourselves with such trivia. If indeed it \ndoes, the11 the jaywalking law will have served us well. -Timothy \nAlexander\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nProvision\u0014\n\u0014\nA sports columnist on the staff of a major metropolitan newspaper \nonce labeled some professional athletes as belonging to the \"Yes, \nBut\" club. \"You know the drill,\" he lamented. \"Larry Holmes once KOd \nMuhammad Ali. Yes, but Ali was long over the hill! Roger Maris broke \nBabe Ruth's home run record. Yes, but his season was eight games \nlonger!\"' \u0014\n\u0014\nMany well-meaning people work diligently in order to achieve a \nmeasure of success and prosperity during their brief lifetimes. It \ncan be said about a number of them, \"Yes, but they have neglected to \nmake provision for the eternal dimension of their existence!\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary \nsafety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" - Benjamin Franklin\u0014\n\u0014\nThe noblest gift of a free people is to offer that freedom to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nMission-minded churches\u0014\n\u0014\nNo church that isnt interested and actively at work in sending the \ngospel story to other people has a right to exist:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is a terrible thing to have seen the vision, and to be so wrapped \nup in its contemplation as not to hear the knock of needy hands upon \nour doors.\"-Phillips Brooks\u0014\n\u0014\nTV and Bible Reading\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to estimates of researchers, the average person, by the age \nof 65, will have spent nine years of his time watching TV and only \nfour months studying the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are four ways to know the Bible. First, know its beauty spots \n the great texts of the Old Testament and the incomparable passages \nof the New. Second, know its individual books  the content and \ncontext of each. Third, know its characters  the men and women who \nthrong its pages and illustrate its truth. Fourth, know its \nstructural ideals  from creation to redemption \u0014\n\u0014\nConvictions\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1555, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley were burned at the stake as \nheretics in Oxford, England. These men were influenced by the \nthinking of Protestant reformers. They broke from the Church of \nEngland and tried to establish what we call a Protestant church. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were sentenced to be burned at the stake. Onlookers took down \ntheir last words. This is what Bishop Latimer said: \"Be of good \ncomfort, Master Ridley, and play the man. We shall this day light \nsuch a candle by God's grace in England as I trust shall never be put \nout.\" He was right. The light that shone through their lives still is \nshining today. These two men put belief into practice.  Don Aycock\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLove\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen 1 was about 12 years of age one my friends moved to a new \nneighborhood. It was not too far to walk, but it was not familiar \nterritory. On a Saturday morning some of us decided that we should \nwalk to our friend's new home. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs we walked we came upon an unusual site. A house had been started, \nfoundation and subfloor installed, then abandoned. The stairwell had \nno stairs. Small trees had grown up, some even in the dirt floor of \nthe basement. We walked away with unanswered questions. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe next time my parents drove past the unfinished house, I said, \n\"Look Mom! What happened?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe said, \"Well son, a young couple bought that lot so they could \nbuild their dream house. They worked hard in all their spare time for \na while. Then something happened to their love for one another. When \ntheir love was gone there wasn't any reason to work.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNow I know that true love has its ups and downs. But it is always \ndurable. Paul wrote: \"Love never fails\" (1 Cor. 13:8).  David L. \nBrown\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDeath -- Last words\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious News Service published an article that included the last \nstatements of some noted persons. \u0014\n\u0014\nEdgar Allan Poe, master of horror, ingenuity, and action blurted out, \n\"Lord, help my poor soul.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Darwin, the British scientist of evolution theory fame, \nconfidently faced death with these words, \"I am not afraid to die.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCarl Jung, the noted Swiss psychologist, gasped these last words to \nhis son: \"Quick, help me out of bed. ...

During that time many of the Irish people immigrated to the \nUnited States. A young Irish boy stowed away on an American-bound \nship. The ship struck an iceberg and began to sink. The captain gave \nthe \"abandon ship\" order, and passengers and crew got into the \nlifeboats. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the tradition of the sea, the captain was the last to leave the \nfloundering vessel. He took his place in the last seat in the last \nlifeboat. About that time the stowaway boy came out of hiding. The \ncaptain ordered his boat back to the sinking ship. He went back on \nboard and put the boy in the seat he had vacated. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the lifeboat pulled away from the sinking ship a second time, \nleaving the captain to go down with his ship, the captain yelled to \nthe boy, \"Son, never forget what has been done for you today.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Irish lad survived that ordeal at sea and eventually reached \nAmerica. He grew to manhood in this land of opportunity and became \nsuccessful in spite of many obstacles. In his later years when he was \nasked why he had never given up in the face of difficulties, he told \nthe story of that night at sea and what the captain had said to him, \n\"Son, never forget what has been done for you today.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the memorial supper the Lord Jesus commanded his people to never \nforget what he had done for them.

A grandparent buys you gifts your \nmother says you don't need.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSexuality\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch historian Roland Bainton has given us helpful background \nmaterial on how human sexuality has been viewed historically.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe biblical view was celebrative. Sexuality was to be received with \ngratitude as part of God's good creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe early church overreacted to the abuse of sex in the pagan world. \nThey came to exalt celibacy as the ideal and to view marriage as an \ninferior state. It was considered merely a \"remedy for sin.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the middle ages marriage was enriched by the idea of romantic \nlove. That view is still with us. While it has made a contribution, \nwe must remember that the essence of romance is the unattainability \nof the object of one's affection. A classic example of this is the \nromantic love between Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot in the story \nCamelot. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Puritan view of human sexuality was hush-hush. As that attitude \ncarried over into the Victorian age, there was a lot of hypocrisy \nabout sexual matters. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe modern sexual revolution has brought a healthy openness about \nsexuality but greater permissiveness and a preoccupation with sex. We \nneed to recover the biblical perspective which views sex as God's \ngift to be received with gratitude and to find expression within \nmarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus and women\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever one's view of the ERA, it is useful to note that Jesus was \nthe original liberator of women, men, and children. Indeed, he did \nmore to liberate women from an inferior status and injustice than any \nother person in history. This is unique among the world's religious \nleaders. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus elevated the status of women. He treated them as persons and \ntook their questions seriously. No act of Jesus and no parable he \ntold was at a woman's expense. He never made fun of women or \nbelittled them. Jesus' attitude toward women was revolutionary in his \nday, even among the Jews. The seventh commandment was originally a \nproperty law. To commit adultery was to devalue another man's \nproperty-his daughter or wife.\u0014",

Consider Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Mary and \nMartha of Bethany, Joanna, Philip's daughters who were in-spired \npreachers, Lydia and Phoebe. It is noteworthy that women were the \nfirst at Jesus' cradle, the last at his cross, and the first to \ndiscover his resurrection. How do we apply this truth to woman's role \ntoday?\u0014\n\u0014\nAttitude \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's human nature to worship at the biggest altars. But what about \nthe little things? Are they not also important? \u0014\nOne vote gave Oliver Cromwell control of England in 1656. One vote \nchanged France from a monarchy to a republic in 1875. One vote denied \nAaron Burr the presidency. One vote elected Thomas Jefferson to that \noffice. Blinded by bigness, we earthlings often miss the importance \nof little things. But Jesus didnt. He spoke of the Father knowing \nwhen one sparrow falls. And it was the one sheep the Good Shepherd \nsought until He found it. Jesus knew the importance of little things. \nAnd it is a lesson we need to learn, for lifes sweetest symphonies \nare often played in the minor keys.  J.B.Fowler\u0014\n\u0014\nChrists Return\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen will the world end? Even the comic strip cat Garfield has an \nopinion. Garfield hates Mondays. In one sequence he sulks under a \nblanket with the thought, \"I'm sure the world will end on a Monday . \n. . at least I hope it does. It would be a shame to end the world \nright before a weekend.\" \u0014\nJesus said: \"But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the \nangels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Take heed, watch; \nfor you do not know when the time will come\" (Mark 13:32-33, RSV). \n-Bill D. Whittaker\u0014\n\u0014\nLove\u0014\n\u0014\nHerschel Hobbs, a former president of the Southern Baptist \nConvention, said that his father died when he was nine years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was 1917 and because of the war it was impossible to hire someone \nto help them on their farm. Hobbs' mother would plow the first \nfurrow, laying out the rows for young Herschel to follow. She would \nthen tum the plow over to her son. It was hard work and the family \nfaced hard times. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, early one morning, the Hobbses looked down the road and saw \na sight that deeply moved them. Wagons were moving toward their farm. \nThe neighbors, for miles around, were coming to the rescue. And by \nthe time night fell on their forty-acre farm, the ground was plowed \nand the crop was planted. \u0014\n\u0014\nLove did it. Christian love always finds a way to express itself.

We need each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nA rather crude and cruel experiment was carried out by Emperor \nFrederick, who ruled the Roman Empire in the thirteenth century. He \nwanted to know what man's original language was: Hebrew, Greek, or \nLatin? \u0014\n\u0014\nHe decided to isolate a few infants from the sound of the human \nvoice. He reasoned that they would eventually speak the natural \ntongue of man. Wet nurses who were sworn to absolute silence were \nobtained, and though it was difficult for them, they abided by the \nrule. The infants never heard a word-not a sound from a human voice. \nWithin several months they were all dead.  Joe E.

One of the signs read: \n\"Open 24 Hours.\" The other added, \"No Loitering After Hours.\" \nFirst-time customers usually stare for a moment before smiling at the \nincongruity of the signs. \u0014\n\u0014\nHonest Christians must admit that our churches often proclaim an \nequally mixed message. We usually claim that all are welcome in our \nfellowship. Yet, there are other, more subtle signs which indicate \nthat some are more welcome than others. \u0014\n\u0014\nDo we truly welcome all people, all of the time? If not, the \nuncertain sound of our mixed message may draw the curious, but not \nfor long. Christians, of all people, are called to sound a clear note \nof love and acceptance for all in the midst of a suspicious society. \n-Tony W.

She \nwas awarded the Pulitzer prize for her sensitive work. \u0014\nOnce when she was with the 5th Company of Marines, she heard another \nnews correspondent talking to an exhausted Marine who was leaning \nagainst a tree, eating his supper out of a tin can. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"If I were God,\" she heard the reporter ask, \"and could grant you \nanything you wished, what would you most want?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nExpressionless, but carefully pondering the question, the Marine \nlifted his tired eyes and slowly replied, \"Just give me tomorrow.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen psychologist William Marston asked three thousand young people, \n\"What are you living for?\" 94 percent of them responded: \"I am only \nenduring today. I am living for tomorrow.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut not even Almighty God can give us tomorrow today. He only gives \nus one day at a time. -J.B.

Only four legionaries were left alive inside, but they did \nnot want the enemy to know how few they were. So the four remaining \nmen propped up the dead bodies of their comrades and ran from man to \nman firing their guns. To the enemy it appeared many were firing \nguns, when, in reality, the fort was almost defeated. \u0014\nMany churches today present a picture of life by hosting many \nactivities and events, often designed to give the appearance of life. \nThe church at Laodicea said they were rich, wealthy, and had need for \nnothing. Yet Jesus said He would spew them out of His mouth because \nthey were miserable and poor and blind and naked (Rev. 3: 16-18). \nBeing busy does not please Goel; our obedience does. Let us return to \nreaching the lost for Christ, teaching them the things of Christ, and \nministering to those in need.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDedication \u0014\n\u0014\nThis simple but wonderful epitaph is inscribed on a weathered \ntombstone in England: \"In the worst of times, he did the best of \nthings.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe times we live in are difficult; immorality is rampant; many \nChris-tians are lax; but your duty is to remain faithful. No matter \nhow bad the times, do the best of things.  Mark Sutton\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDishonesty \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the couple arrived in Las Vegas, the husband became fascinated \nby the casinos and started betting on all the attractions. After four \ndays, they had just two dollars left. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let me go to the casino alone,\" the man said. \"I've got a feeling \nthat I'll be lucky today.\" Once downstairs, he went to the roulette \ntable and put his last two dollars on number 14, red. His number won. \nHe continued betting and winning. Within an hour he had acquired \n$50,000. Feeling that his luck was about to change, he picked up his \nchips and walked toward the cashier. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust before he reached the cashier, he felt one final urge to bet. He \nwent back to the roulette table and put everything on number 10, \nblack. The wheel spun around and stopped on number 12, red. The \nfellow dragged back to his room. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well,\" his wife asked anxiously, \"how did you make out?\" He said, \"I \nlost two dollars.\"' You do not have to tell an outright untruth to be \ndishonest. Being dishonest can be telling a half truth or not all the \ntruth. -Gene Jennings\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGods Standard\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Roy Angel, in his book God's Gold Mines, relates an event from \nthe life of President John Quincy Adams. President Adams called both \nhouses of Congress together and walked to the rostrum carrying two \nbushel measures. The measures were considerably different in \ncapacity. One measure contained 68 cubic inches less than the other. \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Adams picked up two one-pound weights, the kind used to set \non balance scales. One weight was an ounce lighter than the other. \n\"Gentlemen,\" said the president, \"we need a standard measure and a \nstandard weight for the United States of America.\" Out of that \nexperience was born the Bureau of Weights and Measures. Thanks to \nPresident Adams, an ounce is the same throughout the country. A \ngallon of milk in Wisconsin is the same as a gallon in Georgia or \nFlorida. We need and have a universal spiritual and moral standard. \nIt's God's Word. We don't have the right to set our own behavior \nstandards that contradicts His revelation  Don Howell\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nInheritance \u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry, statesman and hero of the American Revolution, is \nknown or his statement demanding liberty or death. More revealing of \nhis character and faith is this statement: \"My most cherished \npossession I wish I could leave you is my faith in Jesus Christ, for \nwith Him and nothing else you can be happy, but without Him and with \nall else you will never be happy.\" -Rick Henson\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSawdust Trail \u0014\n\u0014\nThe former major league baseball player Billy Sunday was an \nevangelist whose name is forever linked with \"the sawdust trail.\" \nBilly Sunday held many of his services in tabernacles where the dirt \nfloors were covered with sawdust which could be swept up and replaced \nto keep the building clean and sweet-smelling. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot too many people know the origin of the term \"sawdust trail.\" At \nthe turn of the century in the logging area of the Northwest \nlumberjacks would enter a dense forest to explore the best place for \nfuture log cutting. Since it was virgin territory no trails existed \nto enter or return from the forest. Instead of using a compass, the \nlumberjacks hauled bags of saw-dust on their shoulders. As they went \ninto the woods, they left a trail of sawdust so they could find their \nway back to the point of entry. In that country \"the sawdust trail\" \nsymbolized a route from dark, unfriendly places back to light and \nfriends and family.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWants or Needs \u0014\n\u0014\nA college student was perpetually late in getting her papers. When \nprofessor asked why, she said she was working two jobs. Knowing she \nhad a full scholarship, he asked why she was working so hard. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm buying a mink coat,\" she replied. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"A mink coat!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you need a mink coat?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe replied, \"I want a mink coat; therefore, I need a mink coat.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAllowing wants to become needs runs the risk of making necessities \nout of luxuries. This is especially troublesome in a world where over \nhalf of the population can't even get the bare essentials for \nsurvival. -James Evans\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHymn Stories\u0014\n\u0014\nMany good books are on the market and in libraries, telling how hymns \ncame to be written. One of my favorites is \"Have Faith in God\" and \nhow it came to be written. It is doubly meaningful to me, for I heard \nthe story from the composer himself, the late B. B. McKinney. I was \nattending Falls Creek Baptist Assembly in Oklahoma, about the summer \nof 1947. McKinney had just led us in singing this hymn, when, \nimpromptu, he told its origin. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I wrote it in 1934,\" he began, \"right in the middle of the Great \nDepression. I was leading the singing in a revival at the First \nBaptist Church in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Saturday morning, during the \nmiddle of the revival, I got to thinking of all the fine members of \nthe Travis Avenue Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, who were \nwalking the streets, looking for work. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was on the staff at Travis Avenue, and among other things, we \nserved free meals in the church kitchen. Thinking of their struggles, \nI sat down and wrote these words and music\": \u0014\n\u0014\nFaith in God\u0014\n\u0014\nHave faith in God when your pathway is lonely, He sees and knows all \nthe way you have trod; Never alone are the least of his children; \u0014\nHave faith in God, Have faith in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you will turn to hymn 376 in the Baptist Hymnal (1975), you will \nnote that Or. McKinney named the tune, \"Muskogee,\" in honor of the \ncity where it was composed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFriends' Stories \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we take time to listen, our preacher friends can share a wealth of \nillustrations. James M. Baldwin, an Illinois minister, and I were \ndriving home from an associational meeting. He told me about the time \nwhen the late Ralph S. Cushman, a Methodist bishop, spoke in Salem, \nIllinois, where Baldwin was serving. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne morning, the two ate breakfast together, and Cushman told him the \nstory behind his poem, \"The Secret.\" Here is Cushman's story, \nreconstructed in my words from memory: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Before I was elected a bishop,\" Cushman began, \"I was pastor of the \nFirst Methodist Episcopal Church in Buffalo, New York, a prestigious \npulpit. I got constant invitations to speak all over the country at \nbusiness conventions, church meetings, and the like. \u0014\n\"Often I'd return to Buffalo on the weekend, tired and unprepared to \npreach to my own people. One Sun-day morning, following my message, a \ndear layman, whom I had known since boyhood, stopped me. He had \nsomething to tell me, but it would anger me. Sure enough it did, when \nhe told me the warmth had gone out of my preaching. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I told my wife, she made me even angrier by saying she felt the \nsame way but had hesitated to say so. By now I was so upset that I \nskipped dinner, going upstairs instead to my study at home. I \nremained secluded all afternoon, refusing supper, then stayed up all \nnight, reading the entire New Testament. By morning I had found the \nsecret-I'd been so busy preaching to others, that I had neglected my \nown devotional life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I always liked oatmeal for breakfast, and the aroma floated up to my \nroom. When Mrs. Cushman asked if I were going to eat breakfast, I \nsaid I'd be right down. But on an impulse, I first sat at my desk and \nquickly jotted off these lines\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wall  something there is that doesn't love a wall,\" wrote Robert \nFrost; and all the world agrees. Whereas some walls are \nuseful-keeping in what is precious and fencing out what is \nfeared-most walls are discouraging: \"I ran up against a blank wall; I \nreached an impasse; I ended up on a dead-end street.\" Every day, we \nencounter some wall that brings us to a sudden grinding halt, that \nstops us dead in our tracks. Whenever we slam against a wall, our \nhearts bleed, even if our eyes stay dry. Our egos are bruised, even \nif our flesh goes unscratched. \u0014\n\u0014\nWalls differ in thickness, height, and length. But any wall deserving \nits name has one characteristic: It is indissoluble-you can't go \nthrough it. The ugliest walls are built of the stones of \ndisappointment: We aim for first place but come in third. We bite a \ncolorful apple, but it's sour. We lose faith in a friend, a cause. We \nlearn we have cancer. We look into a mirror, and the image we see is \nnot to our liking. We fail in business, lose a job. Our fondest \ndreams melt in air too thin to breathe. At times, we feel as if God \nHimself is blocking our goals, as the biblical writer said, He hath \nenclosed my ways with hewn stone\" (Lam. 3:9). \u0014\n\u0014\nHow many walls do we encounter in a lifetime? For a partial answer \ncount the pages of a calendar, for no day dawns except a wall casts \nits shadow. No sun ever rises or sets on a perfect horizon. \"When We \nCome to the End of a Perfect Day\" is a lovely song but, at best, it's \nonly a wish. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it's no idle wish to believe that beyond every wall is a \nfair meadow, shimmering with goldenrod, purple aster, and red sumac. \nNeither is it a fantasy to believe that although we can't push our \nway through the walls that dampen our dreams, other vistas still \nunfold before us. \u0014\n\u0014\nSomewhere, someway, somehow, we can master the wall. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDoubling Relationships\u0014\n\u0014\nWayne Oates told of listening, with a group of students, to a \nneurologist give a lecture on the brain syndromes and human behavior. \nThe neurologist took the group to his laboratory and showed them \nbrain specimen that had been taken from people who had died. \u0014\nThen in the midst of his lecture, he said: \"The brain is nourished by \nstimulation from meaningful relation-ships to other people. And in \nthe absence of this, the brain starves. We need to find the secret \nof adequate and proper stimulation of the brain by a meaningful and \nenriching community.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This was like a bolt out of the blue to us,\" related Oates, \"to hear \nthis from a neurologist in a pathology lab. -Joe E. Trull\u0014\nSelf-Centeredness\u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago in Mississippi, a doctor taught a Red Cross course in \nlife-saving techniques and emergency medical assistance to a large \nnumber of ladies in the community. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne evening a very serious accident occurred right in front of the \nhome of one of these ladies. At the next meeting, the lady told the \ndoctor that in the midst of that emergency she was so grateful for \nthe Red Cross course. She said to him: \"It was horrible-there was \nblood on the street, bruised bodies and broken bones. I was so glad \nto have had your course!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe doctor said, \"Were you able to use what I taught you?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes,\" the woman replied. \"I put my head between my legs and breathed \ndeeply, and do you know that I never even felt like I was going to \nfaint!\"  Joe. E. Trull\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTalents \u0014\n\u0014\nIn seventeenth-century Italy, in the town of Cremona, lived a young \nboy named Antonio. Antonio was often sad because he lived in a town \nthat was famous for its music, but he could neither sing nor play. \nAntonio's voice was high and squeaky, so he was not welcome in the \nCremona boys' choir. When he took violin lessons, the neighbors \npersuaded his parents to make him stop. Yet, Antonio still wanted to \nmake music. \u0014\n\u0014\nAntonio's friends kidded him because it seemed that his only talent \nwas whittling, but he did not give up. One day the boy learned that a \nworld-famous violin maker named Amati lived in Cremona. The next \nmorning Antonio went to visit Amati and begged to serve as his \napprentice. For many years he studied and worked. Antonio's knack for \nwhittling grew into the skill of carving; his hobby became his craft. \nPatiently he fashioned many violins, striving to make each one better \nand more beautiful than the one before. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Antonio died, he left over 1500 violins, each one bearing a \nlabel which said \"Antonio Stradivarius.\" Today they are the most \nsought-after violins in all of the world. The clarity of tone and \ncareful craftsmanship remain untouched by the centuries. Today \nAntonio's violins sell for more than $100,000. \u0014\n\u0014\nAntonio Stradivarius could neither sing nor play, but he did what he \ncould, and now, over three hundred years later, his violins are still \nmaking beautiful music. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristians are sometimes concerned because they cannot sing or play \nor preach or even teach. However, the important thing is not where \nour talent lies, but whether we are using the talents we have. A song \nin the heart will surely find expression through some phase of the \ndedicated Christian's life. -Tony W. Cartledge\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLouisa Fletcher wrote a poem, \"The Land of Beginning Again.\" It \nbegins: \u0014\n\u0014\nI wish that there were some wonderful place \u0014\nCalled the Land of Beginning Again, \u0014\nWhere all our mistakes and all our heartaches \u0014\nAnd all of our poor selfish grief Could be dropped like a shabby old \ncoat at the door, \u0014\nAnd never be put on again.'\u0014\nCounterfeit Christians \u0014\nA special group of men perform an important task for the United \nStates Treasury Department. Their job is to track down counterfeit \nbills and those who distribute them. Naturally, these men must be \nable to identify readily fake currency. \u0014\nHow are they trained to do this? You would think they'd study all \ntypes of counterfeit money being printed. No, that's not what they \ndo. They spend hours with \"real'' money. \u0014\nThey come to know how the bills look and even how they feel. These \nagents don't have to know all the different types of \"funny money.\" \nBecause they are intimately familiar with the real thing, everything \nelse stands out as false. \u0014\nWe Christians do not need to be informed of every type of sin that \nexists. We should concentrate on getting to know our Heavenly Father \nbetter and living closer to Him.  Mark Sutton\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEndurance \u0014\n\u0014\nAs we watch the talented wizardry of basketball star Michael Jordan, \nwe may assume his success came easy. However, Bob Greene, author, \nTime, reveals that at age 15 was cut from his junior high basketball \nteam; but he didn't let his an early failure keep him from working \nand developing his skills.' \u0014\nChurches and church leaders need to learn to endure. The race we run \nis not a short sprint; it is a marathon. We need to keep on until the \nbattle is won. -Steve McKown\u0014",

    "words": "Immaculate Conception Became Catholic Doctrine\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nImmaculate Conception, Virgin Mary\u0014\nDeclaration of Immaculate Conception\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Pius IX declared the Immaculate Conception of Mary an article of \nfaith on this day, December 8, 1854. According to his pronouncement \nin Ineffabilis Deus, Mary was given the grace to be sinless at the \ninstant of her conception. Sin was shut out of her. The teaching was \ncontroversial among Christians at large. Neither Protestant nor \nOrthodox accepts it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn general, Christians insist that any major doctrine must be clearly \nbacked up by some Scripture. Catholics require the same. Yet, as the \nCatholic Encyclopedia admits: \"No direct or categorical and stringent \nproof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture.\" Edward \nO'Connor, compiling a massive defense of the belief went even \nfurther, acknowledging that the idea was not even a tradition of the \nearly church, coming to the fore about only 1100 AD.\u0014\n\u0014\nScriptural Evidence of Immaculate Conception\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to O'Connor, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was \n\"handicapped by the lack of any clear Scriptural evidence (or, \neven...any explicit patristic tradition) in its favor, but it even \nseemed to go counter to the clear teaching of St. Paul...and Christ's \nown declaration...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is more, many of the greatest fathers of the church and its \n\"doctors,\" explicitly rejected the idea. How could this belief be \naccepted when it is not taught in Scripture, had at best a weak early \ntradition, and was explicitly rejected by theologians of the highest \nrank?\u0014\n\u0014\nWas the \"Mother of God\" Sinless?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the early church recognized that God chose Mary for a \nspecial place in His plan, countless sources both east and west show \nthat she was not considered sinless. However, in the eastern part of \nthe church, some theologians did write of Mary as pure and holy. Mary \nwas called the \"Mother of God\" and, in passing, some remarked that \nshe had special flawless holiness. Gradually, in the western church, \nthis belief became the assertion of an unfallen nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the twelfth century, the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary \nwas widely accepted in the Roman Church, although there was still \nstrong opposition to the belief. St. Thomas Aquinas especially \nobjected that \"If the soul of the Blessed Virgin had never been \nstained with the contagion of original sin, this would have detracted \nfrom Christ's dignity as the savior of all men.\" Many others stood \nwith him. Thomas recognized that if Mary were without sin, she would \nnot need a Savior; the Bible would then be wrong in saying Jesus was \nthe Savior of all men and that \"all have sinned and fall short of the \nglory of God; there is none righteous, no not one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe thirteenth-century philosopher Duns Scotus tried to sidestep \nAquinas' argument by saying that Mary's freedom from sin was a \nprivilege given to her on the basis of Christ's future merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth before and after the dogma was made binding on faithful \nCatholics by Pius to be \"firmly and constantly... believed by all the \nfaithful,\" theologians sought for new arguments to justify the \nteaching. Theology is a progressive science, they said. The church \ncomes to understand some mysteries only after pondering them a long \ntime in its heart. Mary was compared to a second Eve, sinless before \nher fall. How could Christ be born of flesh that was at some point in \ntime under Satan's dominion? they asked. They argued that just as the \nHoly Spirit set John the Baptist apart while he was still in the \nwomb, so Mary, to an even greater degree was set apart. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, other theologians replied to all these arguments and raised \nother objections--for instance is it credible that Mary, a mere \nmortal, withstood all temptation when even Christ, the living Son of \nGod, could overcome the gravest only by sweating blood?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur.

When Roman Emperor Julian asked Basil to \njoin his court, he refused because Julian had turned his back on \nChristianity. Emperor Julian was so angry, he fined Basil l,000 \npounds of gold--equivalent to nearly $6 million dollars. Basil \nlaughed off the fine as ridiculous, and reminded Julian that the two \nhad studied scriptures together as schoolboys.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough today less than 1 percent of the people in Turkey are \nChristian, in the early days of the church, Turkey, then called Asia \nMinor, was a center for Christianity. Basil was born into an \nupper-class Christian family in Cappadocia. His mother and \ngrandmother took special care to bring him up as a Christian. Basil's \nfamily produced other famous Christians. His brother is known as St. \nGregory of Nyssa, a remarkable theologian and writer; his sister was \nSt. Macrina, who founded a Christian community on the family property \nand who convinced Basil to leave the law for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Basil gave himself to the service of the church, he became a \nhermit and founded one of the earliest communities of monks in the \nMideast. Leaving his reclusive life, he joined Gregory of Nazianzus \nin preaching. When famine overtook Cappadocia in 368, Basil sold \ninherited property to help the suffering and to feed the hungry. In \n370, he became Bishop of Caesarea. Here he founded hospitals, \nhostels, and schools, largely financed from his own funds. Children \nwere cared for, slaves protected, and the homeless given shelter.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before he became the bishop of Ceasarea, Basil was an activist \non important issues of the day. He staunchly defended the deity of \nthe Holy Spirit and the doctrine of the Trinity (that God is three \npersons in one being).\u0014\n\u0014\nOn January 1, we remember St Basil for his sound Christian theology, \ncompassion for the poor, sick, and homeless, and as a man who was \nwilling to stand up for his faith--even against the mighty Roman \nemperor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "Backus Bucked Formalism, Formed Baptist Church\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if you asked your pastor how you could be rescued from God's \nwrath and he said he didn't know? That is what happened to Isaac \nBackus. The Great Awakening was in full swing in America. Evangelists \nwakened Americans to realize they needed to repent of sin, and Isaac \nwas afraid.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen his pastor could not show him how to get right with God, Backus \nwent about his business. For weeks he prayed desperately that God \nwould show him how to save his soul. He felt powerless and very \nfrightened. Peace came one morning as he mowed a field. \"I was \nenabled by divine light to see the perfect righteousness of Christ \nand the freeness and riches of his grace,\" he later wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus was determined that no one else should suffer as he had by not \nknowing how to find salvation. He studied Scripture so that he could \nexplain to others that Jesus took our sin to the cross with him and \nthat forgiveness is ours if we confess our sins to God, believing he \nis able to restore us.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople noticed the young man's zeal. Backus was about 22 when he \nbegan to preach and 24 when a little \"separate\" church in \nMiddelborough, Massachusetts asked him to be their pastor. Separates \nwere those who were converted in the Great Awakening and left the \nestablished church thinking its ministers were cold fish who knew \ntheology but didn't know Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAware of his great responsibility, young Backus pleaded earnestly \nwith the Lord that \"he wouldn't suffer me to settle down in any snare \nor evil way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus would have stayed with the Separates, but when he changed his \nviews on baptism, his congregation grew cold toward him. And so, on \nthis day, January 16, 1756, he formed the first Baptist church in \nMiddleborough. It is as a Baptist that Backus is famous. When he was \nborn, there were only 1,500 Baptists in New England. When he died, \nthere were 21,000-- many of them converted through his efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus is most famous for his long battle against taxation to \nsupported state churches. It is wrong to force a person against their \nconscience, he said. \"In Christ's kingdom, each one has equal right \nto judge for himself.\" His recorded the testimony of hundreds who \nsuffered harassment because they refused to pay the religious tax. \nThese included several members of Backus's own family, who went to \njail or lost their property. Once he himself was seized by a \npoliceman, but someone paid the tax for him. Through letters, \ntestimony and civil disobedience, Backus forced Massachusetts to face \nits religious problem. He made others aware of the situation, too, \nriding 1,200 miles a year on horseback to inform them about it. He \nprinted pamphlets. But separation of church and state was not \nachieved until after he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus also had a hand in founding America's first Baptist school of \nhigher learning, Rhode Island College (Brown University).\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "words": "Inauguration Musical Performances Are Tricky. But Lady Gaga, Jennifer \nLopez and Garth Brooks Did Exactly What We Needed Them to Do\u0014\n\u0014\nBY STEPHANIE ZACHAREK \u0014\n\u0014\n JANUARY 20, 2021    TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Lady Gaga, the first performer at the inauguration of President \nJoe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, stepped toward the podium \nto sing, everything about herthat tropical-red pouf of a skirt, the \ncolossal golden dove perched on her shoulder, that milkmaid from MoMA \nhairdowas a celebratory announcement: Welcome to the modern age! \nThough the road ahead is rocky, we no longer need to live in dread. \nGaga, living completely in the moment, had arrived to point the way \ntoward the future.\u0014\n\u0014\nInauguration musical performances, in their need to balance solemnity \nwith jubilation, are always tricky propositions. But the Biden-Harris \nperformancesfrom Gaga, J. Lo and Garth Brooks, performers from \ndisparate backgrounds and different disciplinesstruck a note unlike \nany weve previously heard. Lets call it a sigh of relief building \nto a cheer of exaltation. Even the cloud-strewn blue of the \nWashington sky seemed keyed to the moment, and to this particular \nevent, taking place in a spot where just two weeks ago a bunch of \nclumsy, if dangerous, insurrectionists took a run at democracy and \nfailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nRead more: Photographs From the Inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala \nHarris\u0014\n\u0014\nJennifer Lopez was the centerpiece performer, but lets talk about \nher first: emerging in all-white Chanel, she projected the confidence \nof a woman who has worked her way to the top of her game. White, as \neveryone likes to note, is one of the colors of the suffragettes, but \nits also the color of working people (in machine-washable cotton) \nand the color of luxury (in dry-clean-only silk and wool). In this \nremarkable high-low J. Lo outfitreplete with a snowy jabot, possibly \na nod to the garb of our founding fathersLopez sang a remarkable \nsong, This Land Is Your Land. It was written in 1940 by Woody \nGuthrie, allegedly in a shabby hotel room just outside of Times \nSquarenot on the 6, but close enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Lopez to sing this songa protest anthem but also an irrefutable \ndeclaration of belongingwith so much conviction and boldness is to \nbring Guthries intent and his dream full circle. This is an America \nhe couldnt have imagined, so terrible in some ways, yet so radiant \nin others. Here is where Woody in his work shirt meets a dazzling \nLatina artist from the Bronx who represents, not just in terms of any \nmonetary success but in her sheer awesomeness, everything that an \nindividual is free to strive toward in America. Lopezs version of \nthe song wasnt a reclamationyou cant reclaim something that \nalready belongs to you. And as she segued into the song we sometimes \nthink of as our second national anthem, America the Beautiful, she \nreaffirmed that sense of ownership and pride. In a breakout moment \nshe shouted out, in Spanish, words that translate into One nation \nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. But you \ndidnt need to speak the language to know what she meant.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a tough act to follow, and the guy who drew the short straw \nwas Garth Brooks. Sure enough, walking out stiffly in his pressed \njeans and cowboy hat, how could he be, after the heroic glamour of J. \nLo and Gaga, anything but a disappointment?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then he began to sing, a version of Amazing Grace that he spun \nout with deep tenderness, as if he were holding a nest full of baby \nbirds in his hands. Democracy, as the late John Lewis told us, is not \na state but an actit is something to be nurtured. Country music, Ray \nCharles and Charley Pride notwithstanding, is generally unfriendly to \npeople of color, perhaps not by design but definitely out of habit. \nYet itlike the blues, like jazz, like rock n rollis part of who \nwe are and where weve been. And to hear Brooks sing this songits \nwords written by a white clergyman, though it took on even greater \npower when it was adopted as a Black spiritualwith such care and \nmodesty opened the door to a new world of possibility and hope. That \nhe invited everyoneeven those of us at home, which was most of usto \nsing the final verse was yet another kind of reaching out. As \nRepublican Senator Roy Blunt pointed out after the performance, it \nwas hard not to recall another version of this song: the time Barack \nObama, spontaneously and, with a capella bravery, launched into it \nduring the funeral service for Reverend Clementa Pinckney, killed in \nthe Charleston shooting of 2015. And now it became clear that when \nBrooks stepped up to the podium in his neat but ordinary clothes, his \nintention was seemingly to deflect attention from himself and draw it \nforward to the song itself. This was an act of humility.\u0014\n\u0014\nGarth Brooks performs  Amazing Grace  at President Joe Biden's \ninauguration.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this, of course, came late in the ceremony, after Lady Gaga \nhad made her own offering to the proceedings, a cover version of the \nworlds most unsingable song, The Star-Spangled Banner. Damn this \nsong! With its anti-democratic intervals, its not made for ordinary \npeople to sing. But Gaga is no ordinary person. Those who are invited \nto sing at inaugurationsamong the greatest of them were Marian \nAnderson and Aretha Franklinare vested with a special \nresponsibility. What would Gaga, in her gorgeous yet out-there Maison \nSchiaparelli outfitan ensemble that, like J. Los, reminded us that \nelegance with imagination is the best, maybe the only, kinddo with \nour weird but also oddly stirring national song?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result was audacious and passionate and a little wild, as if the \nidea of patriotism (the true kind) had been beamed from Earth to Mars \nand back again, as a kind of test. Then she reached the line about \nOld Glory continuing to wave valiantly, having survived bloody battle \nand hardshipa line that should be corny, but that still stops my \nheart if its sung the right way. Just as she sang, But our flag was \nstill there, she turned and, astonishingly, with a sweep of the arm \nstraight out of Puccini or Verdi or Bizet, directed our attention to \nthe actual flag. Her intent wasnt just a subtext. It was a shout of \njubilation and defiance. After all of this, our flag is still there! \nAnd how dare anyone even try to mess with it. Just two weeks ago, at \nthis very site, a group of irritable, willfully misinformed \nself-styled militants sought to replace that flag with one emblazoned \nnot with stars and stripes but with one mans name. Angry at the \nsense that the world was moving beyond them, they had no idea that it \nhad long ago moved past them. And now Lady Gaga sings not for them, \nbut for us, for everybody who chooses, with fortitude and optimism, \nto move forward into the modern age, in our cowboy hats, our hard-won \nChanel, and our shocking-raspberry ballgowns. Come as you arebut \ndefinitely come.\u0014",

    "words": "June 11, 1963: Tuscaloosa, Alabama on the University of Alabama \ncampus. Vivian Malone, a young black woman, enrolled as a student at \nthe university, but not without opposition. Federal troops were there \nto ensure her entrance into the school, but her way was blocked \npersonally by Governor George Wallace. I saw that happen on the \nevening news; some of you did too. We didnt have the Internet, \nFacebook or any of that other stuff in those days. But the world saw \nthat happen. Holding out for racism and segregation, the governor \nfailed in his attempt to keep her out. Vivian became the first \nAfrican-American student ever to graduate from the University of \nAlabama.\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Wallace came to regret his actions of June 11, 1963 and \nyears later was taken in his wheelchair into the Dexter Avenue \nBaptist Church in Montgomery, and there asked the black people to \nforgive him for his hardness. The governor also regretted how he \ntreated Vivian that day and sought out her forgiveness. He wanted to \nmake amends before he died, and he wanted to meet her. Vivian did \nmeet him and told him that she had already forgiven him years \nearlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nInterviewed in 2003, she was asked about this:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You said you'd forgiven him many years earlier?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh yes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And why did you do that?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHer reply: \"This may sound weird. (But) I'm a Christian, and I grew \nup in the church. And I was taught thatjust as I was taught that no \nother person was better than Ithat we were all equal in the eyes of \nGod. I was also taught that you forgive people, no matter what. And \nthat was why I had to do it. I didn't feel as if I had a choice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           And what were those words I asked you to remember? \nForgiveness is not an emotion, it is a decision of the will. As we \npractice the work of forgiveness we discover more and more that \nforgiveness and healing are one.  (Agnes Sanford)\u0014",

    "title": "INFAMOUS INDULGENCE LED TO REFORMATION",
    "words": "Infamous Indulgence Led to Reformation\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Leo X's Infamous Indulgence\u0014\n\u0014\nWarlike Pope Julius II died in 1513, and his successor, Giovanni de' \nMedici, took the name Pope Leo X. If Julius loved to fight, Leo \npreferred amusement. His self-indulgence destroyed the unity of the \nwestern church when he bartered sin for money in the most infamous \nindulgence of church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom birth, Leo had been earmarked for the church. At the age of \nseven, he was made a monk. By thirteen he was a cardinal. In between, \nthe boy had been abbot. He became pope before turning forty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis tastes were costly. He was only too happy to spend lavishly on \nhimself and voluptuous entertainment. Humanists with few morals \nswarmed at a papal court where wit mattered more than a witness. \nPlays and shows, ballets and games abounded. No chance for a hunt was \nturned down. The papal treasury funded preeminent artists such as \nRaphael. Julius left a full treasury. Leo drained it in eight short \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelling \"Salvation\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's Basilica was being rebuilt, but there was no money. Leo \ndecided to solve the problem in time-honored fashion. On this day \nMarch 15, 1517, he declared that anyone who contributed to the \ncathedral would be granted an indulgence. Although in theory, an \nindulgence was only a remission of penalties meted out in this world \nby the church, in practice, it was hawked as if it covered the actual \nguilt of sins and could release souls from Purgatory. The gist of the \nindulgence was as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...[I] absolve you ...from all thy sins, transgressions, and \nexcesses, how enormous soever they be...and remit to you all \npunishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account and I \nrestore you...to the innocence and purity which you possessed at \nbaptism; so that when you die the gates of punishment shall be \nshut... and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain \nin full force when you are at the point of death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent to preach the indulgence in Germany was a Dominican named \nTetzel. Tetzel got above himself in his promises, implying that the \nindulgence even covered the future sins which the buyer was now \nharboring in his heart. Frederick the Wise refused to allow the \nindulgence to be preached in his territory of Saxony, mostly because \nhe was reluctant to allow Saxon coin to leave his \nfinancially-depleted realm. Tetzel came as near the border of Saxony \nas he could. Folk from Wittenberg crossed over and bought the prized \npapers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSparking the Reformation\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward a few doubted the efficacy of the writs. They solicited the \nopinion of a middle-aged monk named Martin Luther. Luther refused to \nconfirm their value. Instead, in an accepted tradition, he posted \ntheses for debate on the door of Wittenberg castle church where a \nlarge crowd was expected. The sequel is well known. From those \nNinety-Five theses, the Reformation was born when Leo refused to see \na problem with the disgraceful sales.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "Commitment \u0014\n\u0014\nOne night when Jack Parr was the emcee of the \"Tonight Show,\" he was \ndiscussing the remarkable work of Albert Schweitzer, missionary \ndoctor in Africa. Before he was thirty he had earned doctorates in \nphilosophy, theology, medicine, and music. \u0014\n\u0014\nJack was expressing his appreciation of a man who was a famed concert \npianist giving his life in a remote corner of Africa, when he might \nhave had the accolades of the world. After a long pause Parr uttered \nthese significant words: \"You know, I'd like to be an Albert \nSchweitzer ... if I could commute.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFailure \u0014\nIn 1974, pitcher Tommy John of the Los Angeles Dodgers was sailing \nalong with an outstanding record, his best season ever. Then, in \nmidseason, something snapped in his pitching arm during a game. A \ntendon in his left arm gave way. He could no longer even grip a \nbaseball, much less throw one with accuracy. Even the team doctors \nwere not encouraging; they urged John to investigate another line of \nwork. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet, Tommy John was determined. Surgeons transplanted a healthy \ntendon from his right arm to his left. Even so, they still doubted \nthat he would ever play baseball again. Indeed, the surgery itself \nwas of the pioneering nature. It took agonizing months for John to \nregain the use of his left hand. He sat out the entire 1975 baseball \nseason, and few people ever expected to see him in uniform again. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Tommy John is a man of faith in God and in himself. He worked \nhard, first at home and then in the Arizona Instructional League. He \ncame back to spring training in 1976 and won back his starting \npitching job with the Dodgers. He pitched well enough to earn \n\"Comeback Player of the Year\" honors in 1976.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse Religion-Cults\u0014\nIrene McKinney, a forty-nine-year-old California divorcee, had a new \nconcept in religion. In a four-page tract she reportedly had written, \nshe described how the sun would explode, causing the extensive \nnetworks of oil, gas, and electric lines to cover the earth with a \nconsuming fire. Following the fire, we would have heaven on earth. \u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. McKinney had a plan for getting the news of this \"new concept\" \nbefore the people. While on a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles \nto New York she passed a note to the pilot advising him that she had \nenough nitroglycerin to blow up the plane. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer request was simple. Actor Charlton Heston was to read her tract \nover network television. The ordeal ended at John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport with the arrest of Mrs. McKinney. \u0014\n\u0014\nThank goodness the plan did not work. Our world doesn't need more \nincoherent religious mumbo jumbo. What we do need, however, are \ncommitted and disciplined followers of Christ who will take his truth \nto people on a one-to-one basis. That is the plan! -Travis Hart\u0014\n\u0014\nHypocrisy\u0014\nWe have all been warned not to \"judge a book by its cover.\" Just ask \nRosalyn Carter. Mrs. Carter was photographed with the Rev. Jim Jones \nof the ill-fated Peoples' Temple group during a campaign visit to San \nFrancisco in September 1976. Jones died with more than nine hundred \nof his followers in the Jonestown, Guyana, mass suicide. On May 6, \n1978, Mrs. Carter was photographed at a Constitution Day celebration \nin Chicago with a Democratic precinct chairman named John Gacy, Jr.  \nGacy, thirty-six, a self-employed contractor, was later convicted of \nsodomy and indicted by police for twenty-nine sex murders. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow deceptive are the ways of people. First impressions, though often \nlasting, are not always a true picture of one's character. Jesus \ntaught us that it is not the things from without but the things of \nthe heart that defile man. -Travis Hart\u0014\n\u0014\nMothers\u0014\nThe influence of godly mothers was apparent in the life of the late \nR. G. Lee, acclaimed in life and death as \"the prince of preachers.\" \nOne biography of Lee quotes a letter he received from his mother when \nhe was studying at Furman University to be a preacher: \"'We are \npraying for you every day. I want to live on in my preacher boy after \nI am dead. So take care of your body. Study hard. Preach your best. I \nam counting on you. I gave you to God before I saw your face. Don't \nrob God of what I gave Him.'\"' \u0014\nThe greatness of the preacher began in the greatness of his mother. \nHow reminiscent of 2 Timothy 1:5, \"When I call to remembrance the \nun-feigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy \ngrandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in \nthee also.\" Dr. Lee's life was a reminder of the eternal truth that \nthe hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world. \n-Roger Freeman\u0014\n\u0014\nSecurity \u0014\nIn 1978 television brought us two dramatic scenes. \u0014\nWe watched the great Wallenda plunge to his death from a high wire. \nHe was master of his craft; yet, when he got in trouble, he made one \nfatal error. He grasped his free-flying balance bar instead of the \nanchored cable beneath him. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks later we watched two men scale the sheer rock face of a \nmountain in Utah. An icy terror filled our hearts as we watched one \nman lose his footing at the eleven-hundred-foot level and fall into \nspace, but he did not die. After a drop of thirty feet, his \nwell-secured rope held; and he was saved. \u0014\n\u0014\nRESURRECTION OF CHRIST\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stone of Jesus' tomb was a pebble compared to the Rock of Ages \ninside! \u0014\nThe stone was rolled away from the door, not to permit Christ to come \nout, but to enable the disciples to go in. -Peter Marshall\u0014\n\u0014\nThe resurrection of Christ is the heart of Christianity, which makes \nit pulsate with the life of God. It is the keystone to the arch of \ntruth, which holds all the faith of the gospel together. It is the \nfoundation of the church. It is the mainspring of Christian activity. \nIt is the lever of power which shall move the world. It is the link \nwhich unites all believers. -F. E. Marsh\u0014\n\u0014\nTestimony\u0014\nI began my ministry in a Kentucky coal-mining camp. A train track and \nthe road ran parallel by the church building. The miners' houses were \nspotted along the road and the rail-road tracks and up an occasional \nhollow. On Sunday nights I often stood by the train tracks and \nwatched some of the old women walking to church. From far down the \ntracks I could spot a tiny light. I watched as the light grew larger \nbut never really bright. Finally, I could make out one after another, \ndressed in bonnet and apron, flashlight in one hand and Bible in the \nother. Their flashlights were all the direction they needed, and \nthose little lights were a testimony to all of us who saw them. -W. \nWayne Price\u0014\n\u0014\nYellowstone National Park captures the imagination of thousands of \npeople who visit it each year. Its magnificent mountain peaks and \ngreen foliage rest peacefully within the mountain country of Wyoming. \nOf all the attractions that lure people to this spot of national \nbeauty, Old Faithful, one of the geysers, is perhaps the best known. \nOld Faithful is not famous because of its size. In fact, numerous \nother geysers in the park erupt to altitudes higher than that \nattained by Old Faithful. The thing that makes Old Faithful such a \nnotable attraction is its persistence. For decades Old Faithful has \nerupted on schedule, gushing streams of water in the air above its \ncavity in the earth. Because it is persistent and, therefore, \npredictable, a visitors' center and viewing area have been built \naround it. Old Faithful illustrates the characteristics of \nfaithfulness and persistence in a responsible person.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnger\u0014\nWoody Hayes, former head football coach at Ohio State University, was \nknown for his antics of anger on the sidelines at football games.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoach Hayes slugged cameramen, reporters, fans, and even the players \nof opposing teams. The straw that broke the camel's back came in \nDecember 1978. Ohio State was playing Clemson University in the Gator \nBowl. Ohio State was behind, but driving for a score, when Clemson's \nmiddle guard, Charlie Bauman, intercepted an Ohio State pass to seal \nthe victory for the Tigers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBauman was driven out of bounds on the sideline near the Ohio State \nteam and coaching staff. Coach Hayes, in a fit of anger, hit the \nClemson player. The next week the Ohio State Board of Regents \nrelieved the controversial Hayes of his job.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne year later, a team consisting of players that Hayes had recruited \nand previously coached, won the Big Ten championship and played the \nUniversity of Southern California in the Rose Bowl for the national \nchampionship. But this time it was Earl Bruce, not Woody Hayes, on \nthe side-lines coaching the Buckeyes of Ohio State.\u0014\n\u0014\nWoody Hayes's uncontrolled anger proved to be his downfall. Anger out \nof control can be costly. The Bible puts it this way: \"It is better \nto be slow-tempered than famous\" (see Prov. 16:32).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnger cost Woody Hayes more than the Big Ten championship. It cost \nhim more than the Rose Bowl and the national championship. It cost \nhim the one thing he loved most - his job! -Travis Hart\u0014\n\u0014\nBlessings\u0014\nIvory soap is a common product with two uncommon qualities. It is the \nsoap which floats and the oldest of the top sellers, but it wasn't \nalways that way. \u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago Ivory was just one brand among many. Then a factory foreman \nblundered by leaving a batch of new soap unwatched in the cooking vat \nduring the noon hour. His lunch was delayed and the soap overcooked. \u0014\n\u0014\nRather than report the mistake and be fired, the foreman decided to \nmake the best of it. He shipped out this new batch anyway. Although \nmuch lighter now, it still cleaned well. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe results surprised everyone. Rather than complaints the company \nwas deluged with orders for this floating soap. The foreman was not \nfired but promoted when he helped company chemists revise and modify \nthe old formula. Thus, Ivory became the soap that floats. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe cross is the greatest example of all. God took the sin and shame \nwhich crucified Christ and turned it into a symbol of his love and \ndemonstration of his power over death.  C. W. Bess\u0014",

    "words": "Christ-Master \u0014\n\u0014\nDiogenes was the Greek philosopher who carried his lamp searching for \nan honest man. He never really found one. \u0014\nOnce Diogenes sailed on a ship which was captured by pirates who made \nslaves of the surviving passengers. A slave trader correctly guessed \nthat Diogenes was no field hand. Did he have a useful trade? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe new slave replied that he was no tradesman or skilled laborer. \nHis only trade was that of governing men. Thus, Diogenes concluded, \n\"I would like to be sold to a man who needs a master.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he was. A man bought Diogenes to become tutor for his sons and \nadviser-ruler of his household. Diogenes again became the master. \u0014\n\u0014\nDiogenes was an astute observer of human nature. Finding a man in \nneed of a master is far easier than the search for an honest man. -C. \nW. Bess\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily\u0014\nThe family is the most violent group in society with the exception \nof the police and the military. According to University of Rhode \nIsland sociology professor Richard Gelles. FBI reports indicate \ndomestic violence is the most common and unreported crime in the \nUnited State. Murray Strauss, director of the University of New \nHampshire family violence research program said, Without help, the \nfamily is a social institution that is destroying itself from within.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key to stable and secure family life is love, mutual respect, and \ncooperation. Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ \nHusbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave \nhimself up for her (Eph. 5:21,25 RSV). -Bill D. Whittaker\u0014\n\u0014\nFoundation\u0014\nLamar McLean built his house in Hialeah, Florida. According to the \nAssociated Press the house is up a tree. The nineteen-year-old school \ndropout spent $10,000 on the five story structure plus another $3,000 \nfor a stereo system. He included carpeting, air-conditioning, and \nplumbing. All that in a giant tree located in his parents front \nyard. Thats some house. But its future is about as bleak as a house \nbuilt on sand. Neighbors are complaining about property values and \nzoning codes. Even if the city inspectors let this one by, the large \nold tree wont last forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe who are older and wiser can shake our heads and wag our tongues. \nThe young man built his dream castle with a poor foundation.  C.W. \nBess\u0014\n\u0014\nFreedom\u0014\nTran Hue Hue was one of fifty who fled Vietnam on a small boat in an \nattempt to escape Communism. As preparations for the trip were made, \nher mother warned, To start on this journey is to accept death. \nFive months later her mothers words became a sorrowful reality. Tran \nwas the sole survivor rescued from a coral reef. I had left our \ncountry ready to die along the way. We were seeking freedom. I had \nlost too much, but I could see beautiful days in the future. My life, \nmy future, will begin now.\u0014\nMany are willing to accept death rather than lose freedom. Patrick \nHenry said Give me liberty or give me death. Christian freedom is \nalso rooted in death, for it took the death of Christ to liberate us \nfrom sin and death. Jesus said, If the son makes you free, you will \nbe free indeed (John 8:36, RSV). -Bill D. Whittaker\u0014\n\u0014\nGOOD IDEAS\u0014\nSome good ideas just don't translate well. Consider this case with \nPepsi Cola. \u0014\nThe soft drink company placed an ad in the Taiwanese edition of \nReader's Digest. The artwork was fine, but the \"Come alive with \nPepsi\" theme needed translation into the Chinese characters. Just \nbefore publication an alert Chinese editor caught the mistake. The \nChinese version read, \"Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the \ndead.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe same advertisement did not fare well in the German translation \nwhich actually ran for several weeks. The Germans were mystified when \ntheir ad proclaimed, Come alive out of the grave. -C. W. Bess\u0014\n\u0014\nWorry \u0014\nIn the stock market crash of 1929, J. C. Penney's dry goods business \nwas financially secure, but he had made some unwise personal \ncommitments that troubled him deeply. A combination of circumstances \nhad so completely broken him physically and mentally that he had to \nbe hospitalized.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was so overwhelmed with the fear of death that one night in his \nhospital room Penney wrote farewell letters to his wife and son, for \nhe did not expect to live through the night. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning he awakened and heard singing in the hospital \nchapel, which was near his room. He slipped into the chapel as the \ncongregation began to sing, \"Be not dismay' d whate'er betide, / God \nwill take care of you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe prayed: \"Lord of myself, I can do nothing. Will you take care of \nme?\" He felt a weight lifted. Suddenly he was a different man. He \nsaid he kept in mind that hymn. He began to lean on God. He began to \nread God's Word and claim its promises. In the years that followed, \nhe became a prince again. Many honors were be-stowed on him. He said \nthat the last part of his life was the best. He dates the beginning \nof that part from the morning in the hospital when he firmly and \ntrustfully took on God as his senior partner. -Lee Roy Davis\u0014\n\u0014\nDEATH\u0014\nIn Margaret Cravens' best-selling novel I Heard the Owl Call My Name, \na young minister has been sent to a remote, northwestern Indian \nvillage by his bishop who knows he has only three years to live. The \nyoung man does not know about his illness, but he learns about death \nfrom the Indians. His first assignment is the burial of an infant; \nmany other funerals follow. The overriding symbol of death\" and \nresurrection is the \"swimmer\" (salmon) which fights its way up the \nriver to lay its eggs and die. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Indians know about the natural rhythms of life and death and \nteach the young priest their great faith. Finally, the young man dies \namong the people he loves and who have loved him. When the burial has \nbeen accomplished, old Marta, who has become his surrogate mother, \nlies awake in the dark and says softly: \"Walk straight on, my son. Do \nnot look back. Do not turn your head. You are going to the land of \nour Lord.\" Death had come as a natural part of life, and the end \nbecame a beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nChange\u0014\nChange is real to all of us. It is a stress factor we all deal with. \nMarshall McLuhan pointed out in The Medium Is the Massage that \nelectronic media have contributed to our rapidly changing world: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The medium, or process, of our time-electric technology-is reshaping \nand restructuring patterns of so-cial interdependence and every \naspect of our personal life. It is forcing us to reconsider and \nreevaluate practically every thought, every action, and every \ninstitution formerly taken for granted. Everything is changing-you, \nyour family, your neighborhood, your education, your job, your \ngovernment, your relation to 'the others.' And they're changing \ndramatically.\" \u0014\n \u0014\nIn Brother to a Dragonfly, Will D. Campbell vividly portrays the \nbeginning of the impact electronic media would have on his family: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Grandma Bettye . . . had one of the first radios in the community \nand invited Joe to come and listen with her as often as he could. One \nof his favorite stories had to do with Grandma Bettye and that Philco \nradio. They were listening to a sermon on Sunday morning. Twelve \no'clock was approaching and she hadn't made the cornbread for dinner. \nShe told him she was going to turn the radio off while she went to \nthe kitchen and made her bread and he was not to turn it on until she \ngot back because while the bread was cooking she wanted to hear the \nrest of the sermon. Joe was too kind to explain to her that a radio \nwas not like a phonograph. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"And he didn't know, and none of us knew, that the radio was ushering \nin an era when nothing could be put to sleep as it once had been, an \nage of motion as well as sound-motion and sound which could not be \ncontrolled. \u0014\n\u0014\nCould not be stopped. Turn it off and it goes right on. And you can \nnever pick up where you left off.\" -David W. Hayes\u0014",

    "words": "Freedom\u0014\nAn ad in the October23, 1978, issue of Newsweek quotes Joseph Joubert \nas \u0014\nsaying, \"It is better to debate a question without settling it than \nto settle a question without debating it.\" One mark of a mature \nperson is the ability to listen to another's opinion without putting \nthat person down. God's people may not agree on every issue, but they \ncan agree to be agreeable, respecting the competency of each soul \nbefore God. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter to Louis Untermeyer, the late Robert Frost wrote: \"All \nmen are born free and equal-free at least in their right to be \ndifferent. Some people want to homogenize society everywhere. I'm \nagainst the homogenizers in art, in politics, in every walk of life. \nI want the cream to rise.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nGotthold Lessing,- an eighteenth century German playwright, said: \"If \nGod were to hold out enclosed in his right hand all truth and in his \nleft hand just the active search for truth and should say to me, \n'Choose,\" I would humbly take his left hand and say: 'Father, give me \nthis one. Absolute truth belongs to Thee alone.' \" -Robert J. Hastings\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief\u0014\nIn Pearl Bucks novel The Mother, a son leads his mother to a \ncemetery. She is mourning the loss of her young-est son. She tells \nher elder son, \"Go away and leave me for awhile and let me weep.\" The \nelder son hesitates, but most passionately the mother insists, \"Leave \nme, for if I do not weep then I must die.\"' \u0014\nGrief must be expressed; it must be experienced if a broken heart is \nto be mended. Give people permission to grieve, for grief is a \nGod-given remedy to help heal broken hearts. -Terry T. Lester\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea, the principal \ncharacter is a fisherman who exhausts himself to the point of \nweariness and pain for his great dream. He struggles not only with \nthe natural elements, such as the vastness of the sea and the \nsuperior strength of the fish, but also with his own attitudes. The \nold man was fishing alone when he hooked a huge fish and seemed to be \npitted against invincible odds. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis sense of destiny stirred in his mind at the crucial hour: \n\"Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman,\" he thought, \"but that \nwas the thing that I was born for.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJames Russell Lowell said, \"No man is born into the world whose work \nis not born with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRESPECT FOR CHILDREN\u0014\nExpectancy must surely have been a part of the life of the German \npriest who was asked why he always removed his hat when he gave \ncatechism to the children of lowly coal miners. The priest answered \nthat he never knew who might be among those children; one might \nchange the world. His most famous student was Martin Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nLOVE\u0014\nHarry Stack Sullivan gives this classic definition of love. \"When the \nsatisfaction or security of another person becomes as significant to \none as one's own, then a state of love exists.\"'\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little boy showed that he had discovered the cost of love when he \ngave a gift to his girlfriend with the attached note: \"With all my \nlove and most of my allowance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago, at one of our state fairs, a crowd gathered about a \nprize hog. That hog was about all that a hog ought to be. His hair \nwas parted in the middle and nicely combed. His hoofs were manicured \nin such a fashion as to have roused the envy of a movie star. \nEverybody who saw that hog realized that the man who raised him knew \nhis business. Now, the boy who was set to look after this hog seemed \nto have been chosen as a foil to further emphasize his perfection. He \nwas a little wizen-faced, hollow-chested, hatchet-heeled fellow who \nseemed bent upon burning up all the cigarettes in the world, and that \nas quickly as possible. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the most startling fact about the whole situation was this: The \nfather of the boy and the owner of the hog was the same man. In the \nhog business this father was a huge success. In the boy business he \nwas an utter failure. And in spite of his vast abilities, this also \nwas one of the tragedies of the life of David. -Clovis Chappell, \nChappell', Special Day Sermons (Grand Rapids: Baker. 1964), pp. 63-64.\u0014\n\u0014\nSUFFERING FOR CHRIS, PERSECUTION\u0014\nLeslie Weatherhead tells of meeting a young Indian army chaplain \nduring World War I. The chaplain said that when he decided to become \na Christian, his whole village blazed up in anger. To make him \nrecant, they tied him to a pillar in the courtyard of his parents' \nhouse, stripped the tur-ban from his head, which is a mark of \nindignity in the East, lashed his back with whips until the blood \nran, and left him standing hour after hour un-der the burning sun. \nThey even had the contents of a sewage bin poured over his head. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the men had done their worst, he was subjected to another kind \nof torture. His aged mother came out and pleaded with him. \"My son,\" \nshe cried, \"I bore you; I brought you up; I love you. You can't bring \nsuch pain and shame to me at the end of my life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man tenderly told her that he had found one who loved him \neven more than she did and that he felt he must remain loyal to \nChrist. For years, even after he became a distinguished minister of \nthe church in India, he remained an outcast from his own people. When \nhe tried to visit his relatives, they would not receive him. Like the \nman born blind, who accepted the gift of sight from the hand of \nJesus, he stood alone. That was his witness. -Leonard Griffith, \nGospel Characters (Grand Rapids: Eerd-mans, 1976), pp. 105-06.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove\u0014\nSomeone has said, \"Life is one crazy thing after another, and love is \ntwo crazy things after each other.\" \u0014\n-Brian L. Harbour\u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage\u0014\nA successful marriage is not one in which two people, beautifully \nmatched, find each other and get along happily ever after because of \nthis initial matching. It is, instead, a system by means of which \npersons who are sinful and contentious are so caught by a dream \nbigger than them-selves that they work throughout the years, in spite \nof repeated disappointment, to make the dream come true. -Brian L. \nHarbour\u0014\n\u0014\nSecurity \u0014\nOne of the earliest memories of Teil-hard de Chardin, the well-known \ntheologian, was of his hair being cut by his mother in front of the \nfireplace. The boy watched in horror as a lock of his hair fell into \nthe fire, blackened, and burned. To him, a part of himself was \nturning into nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first time he understood that he was not indestructible. His \nyoung mind needed something imperishable to cling to since he knew he \nwas perishable. He fixed his attention first upon iron. He soon \nrealized that iron would rust and perish. He then turned to rocks \nsuch as amethyst, citrine, and chalcedony as imperishable substances. \nTo his mind, these rocks offered the stability to which he could \ncling. The child matured, however; and he knew there was no \nimperishable substance which offered him the stability which he \ndesired. \u0014\nHis beginning pilgrimage to find the \"rock\" that makes life stable \ncorresponds to the experience of others. Many are searching for that \n\"rock\" to hold them in the storms of life, to be imperishable, even \nwhen everything else is perishing. \u0014\nThere is such a \"rock.\" He is the Creator, the eternal God. King \nDavid, among others, affirmed this comforting truth: \"The Lord is my \nrock, and my fortress, and my deliverer\" (2 Sam. 22:2, RSV). -H. \nJoseph Blair\u0014\n\u0014\nTime Management\u0014\n\"On this minute hangs eternity. Those words, inscribed on a sundial \nin Harvard Yard, constantly remind students of Harvard that their \nmost priceless possession is the immediate moment, life's omnipotent \n\"now\"! Carlyle put it this way: \"One life, a little gleam of time \nbetween two eternities, no second chance for us forevermore.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nVictory \u0014\nIn the floor of the capitol building in Austin, Texas, are the names \nof the battles fought for Texas independence. Above each name is a \npicture of crossed torches, the symbol of victory. The fact is, \nhowever, that in many of those battles the Texas forces were \ndefeated. Our guide said, \"The torches proclaim a victory even though \nthe battle was lost because ultimately there was victory.\" -Meredith \nHair\u0014\n\u0014\nWITNESSING\u0014\nIf we are really serious about witnessing, then we must take time to \nrelate to people. . . \u0014\n\u0014\n\"While in seminary, my wife and I were members of a church in \nsuburban New Orleans. During a Sunday School lesson, the teacher \nasked, 'What would you like to hear when a visitation team enters \nyour home?' Many of us offered theological answers or the usual \nclichs. But one quiet, unassuming man responded, 'When a visitation \nteam enters my home, the first thing I want to hear is my name.' His \nreply indicated a yearning to be treated as a unique individual who \nneeds acceptance through relationships with people. -M. Dean \nRegister, \"Witnessing-a Relationship Approach,\" Outreach, January \n1979, p . 46.\u0014\n\u0014\nRACE\u0014\nIn spite of overwhelming odds, the contribution of the black man in \nbuilding a better society has been tremendous. Note these records: \u0014\nBenjamin Banneker helped to plan the nation's capitol, Washington, \nD.C. He also constructed the first clock in America when he was just \ntwenty-two years old. From 1792-9S he published one of the earliest \nseries of almanacs brought out in the Unit-ed States.\u0014\nDaniel Hale Williams, founder of the Provident Hospital in Chicago, \nmade history in Chicago when he per-formed the first successful \noperation on the human heart. \u0014\nGarrett A. Morgan invented the Morgan inhalator, a gas mask for \nrescue operations. He also invented an automatic traffic light which \nGeneral Electric bought for $40,000. \u0014\nCharles Richard Drew, who has been called the Father of Blood Plasma, \ninvented the blood bank and became the first director of the American \nRed Cross Blood Bank.\u0014\n'If you hate me because I am ignorant, I'll educate myself. If you \nhate me because I am dirty, I'll clean myself. If you hate me because \nI am pagan, I will become a Christian. But if you hate me because I \nam black, I can only refer you to God who made me black.\" -Milan David\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When people universally realize that all are united by the common \nbond of \"mortality and by the basic needs ... the need to worship and \nto love, to be housed and fed, to work and play-perhaps we will have \nlearned to understand-which is to love spiritually, and there will be \npeace and brotherhood on earth. Without brotherhood, peace is not \npossible.\" -Faith Baldwin\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best way to prove to yourself that you're not superior to a man \nof different color or creed is to get acquainted with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nMax Jukes lived in New York. He didn't believe in Christianity or \nChristian training. He refused to take his children to church even \nwhen they asked to go. He has had 1026 descendants: 300 were sent to \nprison for an average term of thirteen years; 190 were public \nprostitutes; 680 were admitted alcoholics. His family thus has cost \nthe state millions. They've made no contribution to society. \u0014\nJonathan Edwards lived in the same state at the same time. He loved \nthe Lord and took his children to church each Sunday. He served the \nLord to the best of his ability. He has 929 descendants. Of these 430 \nwere ministers; 86 became university professors; 13 became university \npresidents; 75 authored good books; S were elected to the United \nStates Congress and 2 to the Senate; 1 was vice-president of this \nnation. His family never cost the state one dollar but has \ncontributed immeasurably to the life you and I lead today.\u0014\n\u0014\nMARRIAGE\u0014\nMarriage resembles a pair of shears, so joined that they cannot be \nseparated; often moving in opposite directions, yet always punishing \nanyone who comes between them. - Sidney Smith\u0014\n\u0014\nConversion\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently Donna Summer, a star of disco rock, began her own TV \nspecial. She declared that she was a born-again Christian. \"I want to \nthank God,\" she exclaimed as she rushed up to accept her three \nAmerican Music A wards. \"If God be for you, no one dare be against \nyou.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSummer said: \"I realized one day that I had everything I wanted and I \nwasn't happy. Something was missing. No matter how much I got in \nmaterial goodies nothing was going to fill the gap. I became ill; I \nhad pain everywhere. For one year I was in the hospital once a month. \nI thought I had a brain tumor or cancer. I had everything. I just did \nnot have God. But now,\" she says, \"everything has changed.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWe may have money, fame, and popularity as did Donna Summer; but, as \nshe came to realize, without Christ things mean nothing. \u0014\nJesus said, \"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole \nworld, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange \nfor his soul?\" (Matt. 16:26). -Lee Roy Davis\u0014",

    "words": "Faith\u0014\nCorrie ten Boom spent the first fifty years of her life living \npeacefully with her father and sister in Haarlem, Holland, over their \nwatch shop. During World War II, this Christian family began \nproviding hiding places for persecuted Jews. As a result, Corrie and \nher sister spent several months in a concentration camp. Subjected to \nall kinds of austerities - inadequate diet, clothing, shelter, \nexercise -she survived many of the other prisoners, including her \nsister, who one by one succumbed in the harsh environment. Corrie, \nthough physically weak, was. full of hope, faith, and optimism. Since \nher release, her tireless travels have enabled her to share with \npeople all over the globe the reality of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we have a spiritual reason for living, we can endure all kinds \nof physical abuse, all kinds of torment. Faith can surmount \nunbelievable odds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you know God, then you have within you the divine resources to \nwithstand what the world can hurl at you and yet emerge victorious. \n-Lee Roy Davis\u0014\n\u0014\nMeaning\u0014\nRiding a commuter train one morning, a passenger turned to his \nseat-mate and said, \"I've got a clock that tells me when to get up - \nbut some days I need one to tell me why.\" The search for meaning and \nsignificance in life is never ending. The why of life is much harder \nto answer than such questions as when, where, what, and who. Job \nstruggled with that question centuries ago, and we still belabor it. \nThat's why so many millions rejoice in faith in Christ, for \nconfidence in his leadership takes the riddle out of living. As the \nnoted psychologist Victor E. Frankl so well expressed it, 'Once we \nknow the why for living, we can bear almost any how.\"\u0014\n-Robert J. Hastings\u0014\n\u0014\nCOOPERATION\u0014\nGeorge Hall used a perfect example in his sermon on cooperation. He \nsaid, \"Snowflakes don't amount to much individually; but when they \ndecide to cooperate, they can shut down a free-way.\" \u0014\nIndividual churches may not be able to do much for missions by \nthem-selves; but when they decide to cooperate through the \nCooperative Program, continents can be captured for Christ. -Lee Roy \nDavis\u0014\n\u0014\nSacrifice\u0014\nDream Voyage for Two Ends with Heroic Death\" read the 1978 newspaper \nheadline. A thirty-eight year-old northern California man and his \neighteen year-old nephew had been lost at sea during a terrific storm \nthat overturned their forty-foot sailing vessel. After many days on a \nrubber raft with little food or water and the sun beating down \nmercilessly, their situation was at a crisis. To top it off, their \nraft was slowly losing air, sinking. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fifteenth day of their voyage dawned with the older man making a \ndramatic decision. He would swim away from the raft, leaving his \nnephew with the few provisions remaining in order to give him a few \nmore days of life. He would give up his own life in the hope that \nthese extra days would help his nephew to be rescued. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter scratching a message to his wife on an empty tin can, he said \nhis farewell to his protesting companion and swam away. Two days \nlater, the young man in the small raft was spotted by a Portuguese \nfishing boat out of its normal range. He was picked up and taken to \nsafety and his family. -Brad Dixon\u0014\n\u0014\nHumility \u0014\nThe truck driver was furious. His huge semi was stopped at a low \nrail-road overpass on an out-of-the-way highway. The trailer was \nabout two inches too high to go under the structure, and the nearest \nalternate route was over a hundred miles out of his way. He was \nrunning behind schedule with a load of perishable produce. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Stupid!\" he was fuming. \"Stupid to build a truck that high! What \nbunch of turkeys would build a bridge that low? Why didn't that \nidiotic yo-yo of a dispatcher tell me about this low overpass?\" A car \nedged around him, and the driver honked his horn. \"Aw, yes, honk, you \njerk!\" The driver let out several profane expletives and waved his \nfist as the car rolled on out of sight. He was getting angrier by the \nmoment. He slammed his truck door and kicked one of the tires. \n\"Sometimes,\" he said, 'Im just tempted to chuck the whole thing!\" \u0014\nA young boy walked by with his little dog. He had on a straw hat, and \nhe carried a fishing pole and a little can of worms. He said, \"Why \nare you so mad, Mister?\" The driver barked out several curse words \nand kicked the tire again. The little boy said, \"Mister, if you'd let \na little air out of those tires, your truck would go under.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe driver thought for a minute and then quickly followed the lad's \nsuggestion. He eased his big rig under the bridge and then filled his \ntires with air at the next truck stop. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow much this is like many crises of our lives. If we would just \nrelax a moment-just stop and think, let a little of the air out of \nour pride and lower ourselves a little we could go on with life's \nburdens. We could \"let go\" and \"let God.\" -James Aldridge\u0014\n\u0014\nInfluence\u0014\nA young college senior's father informed him that as a graduation \ngift he would be made a junior partner in the family business. \nOverjoyed, the young man requested to design his own office. The \nrequest was granted, and the project was begun. It was to be a \nbeautiful office, with the desk in the center. There were to be no \ndistracting cords running from the walls. All telephone wires were \nrun under the floor and up through the desk. Finally the plans were \ncomplete and construction begun. \u0014\n\u0014\nFilled with dreams, the young graduate settled in his new office. \nHowever, he soon realized that he had neglected to include a desk \nlight. Procuring one and finding no place to plug it in, he attached \nit to the current in the telephone system buzzer. He flipped the \nswitch, but there was no light. After going over the process again, \nto no avail, he called for the construction foreman and explained the \nproblem. Immediately the fore-man began to smile, explaining that the \npower supply for the buzzer was not sufficient for a light. \u0014\nYou see, it takes more power to make a light than to make a noise! \nThis was the point that Jesus was making when he said, \"Let your \nlight so shine before men that they may see your good works and give \nglory to your Father who is in heaven\" (Matt. 5:16, RSV). -Charles H. \nChandler\u0014\n\u0014\nSimplicity, GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATION\u0014\nA local businessman has been involved recently in filing an \napplication with the FCC for the purchase of the local radio station. \nHe says that one of the most time-consuming matters is trying to read \nand understand all the government forms. The wording of the forms is \ndifficult for the average person to decipher. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe came across the following paragraph recently which he says must \nhave been worded by the same folks who write the FCC forms: \u0014\n\"We respectfully petition, request and entreat that due and adequate \nprovision be made, this day hereinafter subscribed, for the \nsatisfying of this petitioner's nutritional requirements and for the \norganization of such methods as may be deemed necessary and proper to \nassure the reception by and for said petitioner of such quantities of \nbaked cereal products as shall, in the judgement of the aforesaid \npetitioners, constitute a sufficient supply thereof.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTranslated, this means, \"Give us this day our daily bread\" (Matt. \n6:11). \u0014\n\u0014\nPraise God that the Bible is simple enough for a child to understand \nand profound enough that the scholars of the ages have yet to plumb \nits depths. -James Aldridge\u0014\n\u0014\nWealth\u0014\nIt is true! Many Christians live below their inalienable rights as \npartakers of \"the unsearchable riches of Christ\" (Eph. 3:8). Too \noften Christianity is tolerated rather than enjoyed. The abundance \nwhich is ours is neglected and unpossessed. Some fit the description \nof the keen observer who said, in one of the classic books on our \nlife in Christ: \"You Christians seem to have a religion that makes \nyou miserable. You are like a man with a headache. He does not want \nto get rid of his head, but it hurts him to keep it.\"' We can't \nexpect unbelievers to believe our gospel when we live below our \nheritage. \u0014\nIn 1975, Lloyd Fjelstead was dis-covered by some concerned people in \na $30 per month room on Seattle's skid row. He was living on day-old \nbread and owned only two changes of clothes. The irony lies in that \nFjelstead had accumulated $175,000 worth of savings bonds which he \nkept in a sea bag locked to his bed. He certainly lived below his \nworth! -Roger P. Freeman\u0014\n\u0014\nForgiveness \u0014\nLeon Jaworski, son of a preacher and noted judge in the Watergate \ntrials, believed that Nixon would have been forgiven by the American \npeople if he had admitted his misdeeds. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the man had shown some remorse and some feeling about the whole \nthing, some regret about it all at the very beginning and more \nparticularly if he had said, 'Now listen, try to remember me by the \ngood things I did and not the bad things I did. I was terrible and I \ndid commit wrongs,' -the guy won't say it!\" Jaworski said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did Nixon refuse to admit wrong and ask for forgiveness, but \nhe also attempted to cover up his wrong by tampering with the \nevidence. Jaworski believes that the gap on the Watergate tape was \nMitchell telling Nixon exactly what happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nHuman nature has always stubbornly refused to repent and to ask \nforgiveness, even before God. \u0014\n-Jack Gulledge\u0014\n\u0014\nGod, The Provider \u0014\nIf King David were living today, how might he write that most \nbeautiful of all psalms, Psalm 23? We can never know, but we might \nsee at least some-thing of the underlying meaning in a contemporary \nparaphrase: \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause God is my Provider, I have everything I need. He compels me \nto rest when my strength has r ached its end. He brings peace to my \ntroubled mind when I need it most. When my resources are exhausted, \nhe renews the springs of life within me. When I am tempted to stray, \nhis hand gently brings me back to the right path. In life's crises \nfear does not haunt me, for I feel his presence always with me. That \npresence is both a weapon with which to fight life's battles and a \ncrutch on which to lean when my burdens seem too great. He treats me \ndaily as a welcome guest, giving me far more than I really need. I \ncan never get away from his goodness and unfailing love. My whole \nlife is spent basking in the sun-shine of that love. And when death's \ndark door closes on the light of my life, it but opens anew to admit \nme into his presence for all eternity. -Harold L. McDonald\u0014\n\u0014\nYouth\u0014\nOver a century ago a young boy was busy at work in the cellar of his \nhome experimenting with chemicals obtained from the local drugstore. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis boy had seldom attended school, indeed his only education was \ngained largely through self-st dy. He read countless books about \nhistory and science. He worked at odd jobs to earn money to buy more \nchemicals for his experiments. His curiosity never ceased and led him \nto experiment continuously. His name? Thomas Alva Edison. \u0014\nThe potential of a child or young person should never be \nunderestimated. The capacity to dream and to explore may lead to a \nsolution of today's problems. -Gage McMahon\u0014\n\u0014\nMUSIC\u0014\nMissionaries report that music helps them communicate the gospel. It \nappeals to all kinds of people, strengthens the believers, helps in \nworship, enhances Christian fellowship, teach-es doctrine, improves \nthe image of Christianity, and is adaptable almost anywhere. -Ernest \nD. Standerfer Resources for Special Occasions\u0014\n\u0014\nExcuses\u0014\nTwo men met at a railway station in Austria one day. One of the men, \nan alcoholic, begged of the other man enough money to buy a bottle of \nwine. The other man said with surprise, \"Why should an \nintelligent-looking man like you sink to the level of living from one \ndrink to another?\" \u0014\nThe beggar explained his difficult life. His mother had died when he \nwas young. His father had beaten the children unmercifully. Then when \nthe war came, the family was permanently separated. \"You see,\" the \nbeggar said, \"I never had a chance.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe other man responded, \"This is strange. My background is similar \nto yours. I, too, lost my mother when I was young. My father was also \nbrutal and cruel. I also lost track of my family because of the war. \nBut I felt that I had no choice but to try and over-come my \ncircumstances rather than be overcome by them!\" \u0014\nAs the two men continued to talk they made a startling discovery-they \nwere brothers! \u0014\n\u0014\nThe way we react to our circum-stances determines our success or \nfailure. Everyone has burdens, fears, and disappointments. These are \nnot excuses for failure; they are opportunities to grow and exercise \nfaith in God. -James L. Evans\u0014\n\u0014\nChange \u0014\nAn early Baptist pastor, Benjamin Keach, is credited with introducing \nhymn singing to English Baptist churches. Keach began with the \nchildren, for they enjoyed singing. But their parents did not, for \nthey were convinced that singing was \"foreign to evangelical \nworship.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA \"grueling controversy\" arose when Pastor Keach sought to intro-duce \ncongregational singing to his church in Horsley Down. With biblical \nevidence, he first got them to agree in 1673 to a hymn after the \nLord's Supper. However, he allowed those who objected to leave before \nthe hymn. Six years later the church agreed to sing a hymn on \"public \nthanksgiving days.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother fourteen years passed before the church could agree that \nsing-ng was appropriate in worship. A full twenty years passed before \none church could agree that singing was good, appropriate, and \nworshipful. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis incident was costly, however, for twenty-two members of Keach's \nchurch withdrew to join a non-singing church. However, singing had \ncaught on, and this non-singing church soon called a pastor who made \nhymn singing a condition of his coming. So goes the slow way of \nchange. -J. Kelly Brown\u0014\n\u0014\nInfluence \u0014\nAlfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, made a fortune by inventing powerful \nexplosives and licensing the formula to governments to make weapons. \nOne day Nobel's brother died, and one newspaper by accident printed \nan obituary notice for Alfred instead. It identified him as the \ninventor of dynamite and the man who made a for-tune by enabling \nhumankind to achieve new levels of mass destruction. \u0014\n\u0014\nNobel had the unique opportunity to read his own obituary in his \nlife-time and to see what he would be re-membered for. He was shocked \nto think that this was what his life would add up to to be remembered \n.as a merchant of death and destruction. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe took his large fortune and used it to establish the awards for \naccomplishment in various fields which would benefit humanity; and it \nis for that effort, not his dynamite, that Nobel is remembered today. \u0014\nWhat will we be remembered for? What contribution to the Lord's work \nare we making? What will our obituary say? -James L. Evans\u0014\n\u0014\nUnity\u0014\nFor 58 agonizing hours, the eyes of the whole nation were focused \nupon Midland, Texas, and a: 22-foot-deep hole in the ground. This was \nno ordinary hole, however, for wedged tightly in the pipe of the \nabandoned well was little Jessica McClure. It appeared that \neverything came to a halt except for the machinery boring a companion \nhole in an effort to cut across. and rescue young Jessica. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis effort brought together a most unusual potpourri of people. \nRacial barriers were ignored. Social standing was forgotten. \nPhilosophical position was unimportant. The subject of religion was \napproached only in the experience of united prayer. We watched rough \ndrill rig operators working alongside physicians. Nurses stood \nwaiting beside fast-food employees. Police officers and other law \nenforcement people stood ready to assist the young, frightened \nparents. The cost of the rescue effort was un-important. Total unity \nfor one common purpose became the focus. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor all of our diversity, can we not manage to come together around \nan-other empty opening in the ground? \u0014\nCan we not stand, united around the empty tomb of a resurrected Lord? \nIf all the effort expended in emphasizing our differences could be \nspent in demonstrating our concern for the lost in our world, what a \ndifference it would make. We are called on to \"rescue the perishing.\" \nGod grant us the wisdom to join hearts and hands around the empty \ntomb of a risen Christ to accomplish our Lord's Bold Mission.\u0014\n-Don Howell\u0014",

    "title": "I KNEW THE TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN AND STAYED SILENT",
    "words": "I knew the truth about women in the Bible, and I stayed silent\u0014\nBETH ALLISON BARR  |  APRIL 7, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\niFirst Christian Deaconesses: Ionia, Lydia, Priscilla, Tryphena, \nPhoebe, and Tabitha. Painting by Kostas Xenopoulos.\u0014\nIt was Pauls women in Romans 16 who finally changed my mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nI still remember the Sunday it clicked. I was upset after the sermon. \nSo upset that I was doing the dishes. The running water soothed my \nmind as I scrubbed lunch plates. My husband knew something was wrong \n(the dishes were a dead giveaway). He walked into the kitchen. He \ndidnt say anything. Finally, I spoke.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont believe in male headship.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe leaned against the counter. I couldnt look at him. More time \npassed, and then he asked, You dont believe that men are called to \nbe the spiritual leaders of the home?\u0014\n\u0014\nI shook my head. No.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe stood there for another minute, and then he just said OK and \nwalked away.\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew he didnt agree with me then  he had been raised in a \ncomplementarian church and attended a complementarian seminary. Yet \nhe was willing to listen and consider a different theological \nperspective. I am forever grateful for the trust he showed me that \nday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasnt actually the sermon that pushed me over the edge, although \nI do remember it had been about male leadership. What pushed me over \nthe edge was a recent lecture I had given in my womens history \nclass. We were talking about women in the early church, as we moved \nchronologically from the ancient world to the medieval world. On a \nwhim, I asked one of the students to open their Bible and read Romans \n16 out loud (at a Christian university I can always count on at least \none student to have a Bible in hand). I asked the class to listen and \nto write down every female name they heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a powerful teaching moment  for the students and for me. I \nknew women filled those verses, but I had never listened to their \nnames being read aloud, one after the other:\u0014\n\u0014\nPhoebe, the deacon who carried the letter from Paul and read it aloud \nto her house church.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrisca (Priscilla), whose name is mentioned before her husbands name \n(something rather notable in the Roman world) as a coworker with Paul.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary, a hard worker for the gospel in Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\nJunia, prominent among the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nTryphaena and Tryphosa, Pauls fellow workers in the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe beloved Persis, who also worked hard for the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nRufuss mother, Julia, and Nereuss sister.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen women recognized by Paul.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven women are recognized by their ministry: Phoebe, Priscilla, \nMary, Junia, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis. One woman, Phoebe, is \nidentified as a deacon. Kevin Madigan and Carolyn Osiek write that \nPhoebe is the only deacon of a first-century church whose name we \nknow. Another woman, Junia, is identified not simply as an apostle \nbut as one who was prominent among the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you know, I asked my students, that more women than men are \nidentified by their ministry in Romans 16?\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you know, I asked my students, that more women than men are \nidentified by their ministry in Romans 16? We sat there, looking at \nthe names of those women.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? a student suddenly interjected, so involved in the lecture she \ndidnt even raise her hand. Why have I not noticed this before?\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably because the English Bible translation you use obscures \nwomens activity, I told her, launching into another explanation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI listened to myself lecturing that day. I listened to myself laying \nout evidence for how English Bible translations obscure womens \nleadership in the early church. I listened to myself as I talked the \nclass through different translations of Romans 16.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake, for example, The Ryrie Study Bible, published by Moody Press in \n1986. My grandfather owned this Bible, and I have his copy on my \nshelf. Instead of recognizing Phoebe as a deacon, it translates her \nrole as servant. Listen to the study note: The word here \ntranslated servant is often translated deacon, which leads some \nto believe that Phoebe was a deaconess. However, the word is more \nlikely used here in an unofficial sense of helper.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the phrase a deacon of the church in Cenchreae had followed a \nmasculine name, I seriously doubt that the meaning of deacon ever \nwould have been questioned.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you catch that? I asked my students. No evidence is given for \nwhy Phoebes role should be translated as servant rather than as \ndeacon. No evidence is given to explain why the word is more likely \nused in an unofficial sense of helper. We can guess the reason for \nthe translation choice: it is because Phoebe was a woman, and so it \nis assumed that she could not have been a deacon. If the phrase a \ndeacon of the church in Cenchreae had followed a masculine name, I \nseriously doubt that the meaning of deacon ever would have been \nquestioned.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I taught, I thought about my own church. About how women rarely \nappeared on stage other than to sing or play an instrument. I thought \nabout how women ran our childrens ministry and men ran our adult \nministry. I thought about the time I had been asked to teach an adult \nSunday school class, and the pastor had come to look through my \nmaterial. Since I was just teaching on church history, he let me do \nit. If I had been discussing the biblical text, though, it would have \nbeen a different story.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere I was, walking my students through compelling historical \nevidence that the problem with women in leadership wasnt Paul; the \nproblem was with how we misunderstood and obscured Paul. Here I was, \nshowing my students how women really did lead and teach in the early \nchurch, even as deacons and apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nJunia, I showed them, was accepted as an apostle until nearly modern \ntimes, when her name began to be translated as a mans name: Junias. \nNew Testament scholar Eldon Jay Epp compiled two tables surveying \nGreek New Testaments from Erasmus through the 20th century. Together, \nthe charts show that the Greek name Junia was almost universally \ntranslated in its female form until the 20th century, when the name \nsuddenly began to be translated as the masculine Junias.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? Gaventa explains: Epp makes it painfully, maddeningly clear \nthat a major factor in 20th-century treatments of Romans 16:7 was the \nassumption that a woman could not have been an apostle. Junia became \nJunias because modern Christians assumed that only a man could be an \napostle.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a historian, I knew why the women in Pauls letters did not match \nthe so-called limitations that contemporary church leaders place on \nwomen. I knew it was because we have read Paul wrong. Paul isnt \ninconsistent in his approach to women; we have made him inconsistent \nthrough how we have interpreted him. As Romans 16 makes clear, the \nreality is that biblical women contradict modern ideas of biblical \nwomanhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew all this. Yet I still allowed the leaders of my church to go \nuncontested in their claim that women could not teach boys older than \n13 at our church. I still remained silent.\u0014\n\u0014\nI continued my lecture. The historical reality is the same for \nPhoebe, I told my students. Paul calls her a deacon. No one disputes \nthe text  they can only dispute the meaning of the text. Phoebe was \nrecognized as both a woman and a deacon by early church fathers. \nOrigen, for example, wrote in the early third century that Phoebes \ntitle demonstrates by apostolic authority that women are also \nappointed in the ministry of the church, in which office Phoebe was \nplaced at the church that is in Cenchreae. Paul with great praise and \ncommendation even enumerates her splendid deeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we can certainly question what Origen meant by the ministry of \nthe church, it is clear that Origen accepted Phoebes appointed \nrole. A century later, John Chrysostom, the golden-tongued \npreacher, wrote of how great an honor it was for Phoebe to be \nmentioned before all the others, called sister, and distinguished \nas a deacon.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth men and women, concludes Chrysostom, should imitate Phoebe \nas a holy one. In his homily on 1 Timothy 3:11, Chrysostom makes it \nclear that he understands women to serve as deacons just as men do. \nAs he writes, Likewise women must be modest, not slanderers, sober, \nfaithful in everything. Some say that (Paul) is talking about women \nin general. But that cannot be. Why would he want to insert in the \nmiddle of what he is saying something about women? But rather he is \nspeaking of those women who hold the rank of deacon. Deacons should \nbe husbands of one wife. This is also appropriate for women deacons, \nfor it is necessary, good, and right, most especially in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf this frank understanding of female leadership by a fourth-century \npresbyter and deacon surprises you, church historians Madigan and \nOsiek remind us that it shouldnt: In Johns churches in Antioch and \nConstantinople, they write, female deacons or deaconesses were well \nknown. Describing Phoebe as a deacon wasnt surprising to Chrysostom \nbecause some of his good fourth-century friends were female deacons. \nIndeed, Madigan and Osiek have uncovered 107 references (inscriptions \nand literary) to women deacons in the early church.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, I told my students, not everyone in the early church \nsupported women in leadership. The office of presbyter testifies \nloudly to how patriarchal prejudices of the ancient world already had \ncrept into Christianity. Remember how Aristotle considered the female \nbody to be monstrous and deformed?\u0014\n\u0014\nEcclesiastical leaders imported these ideas into their council \ndecisions, declaring as early as the fifth century that female bodies \nwere unfit for leadership. As Madigan and Osiek write, Cultic purity \nbecomes associated with males, impurity with females. This was the \nbiggest argument against women presbyters.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the sixth century, while the church was moving across the European \nlandscape and replacing the old secular seats of Roman power with the \nsacred offices of bishop and priest, women also were on the move, \nback into their prior place under the authority of men.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Barr, why dont they teach us this in church?\u0014\n\u0014\nI looked at the student, my heart twisting. Most people simply dont \nknow, I said. Seminary textbooks are often written by pastors  not \nby historians (and especially not by women historians). Most people \nwho attend complementarian churches dont realize that the ESV \ntranslation of Junia as well known to the apostles instead of \nprominent among the apostles was a deliberate move to keep women \nout of leadership (Romans 16:7). People believe that women were \nbanned from leadership in the early church just as they are banned \nfrom leadership in the modern church. The church teaches what it \nbelieves to be true.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were the things I said out loud.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I didnt say  and what made the tears roll down my cheeks as I \nstood in front of my sink that day  was that I knew the truth. I \nknew the truth, and still I stayed silent at my church.\u0014\n\u0014\nI stayed silent because I was afraid of my husband losing his job. I \nwas afraid of losing our friends. I was afraid of losing our ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nComplementarianism rewards women who play by the rules. By staying \nsilent, I helped ensure that my husband could remain a leader. By \nstaying silent, I could exercise some influence. By staying silent, I \nkept the friendship and trust of the women around me. By staying \nsilent, I maintained a comfortable life.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcept I knew the truth about Pauls women. I knew the reality that \nwomen who are praised in the Bible  like Phoebe, Priscilla and Junia \n challenge the confines of modern biblical womanhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a historian, I knew that women were kept out of leadership roles \nin my own congregation because Roman patriarchy had seeped back into \nthe early church. Instead of ditching pagan Rome and embracing Jesus, \nwe had done the opposite  ditching the freedom of Christ and \nembracing the oppression of the ancient world.\u0014\n\u0014\nI turned the water off in the sink and stacked the dishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was time for me to stop being silent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBeth Allison Barr serves as professor of history and associate dean \nof graduate studies at Baylor University.

    "title": "IT WAS ALL GOOD AT THE BEGINNING",
    "words": "It was a brand new group, unsure of even what it was and certainly of \nwhat it was going to be. New groups have a spirit all their own. In \n1970, I decided that there ought to be a youth football league in the \nSkipwith area of Richmond because there was nothing there for the \nchildren. They had to go to the Laurel area or the Kanawha area or \neven further for their children to play. I set out to raise $10,000, \nto engage a large number of people to help us do the things that \nfootball operations have to do, to select coaches, cheerleader \ncoaches, and all the things that such operations demand. \u0014\n\u0014\n         There was nothing but unanimity, dedication to the task, and \na sense of togetherness that was inspiring. People were eager to \nserve. No one ever said to me, Ive done my share of the work, let \nsomebody else do it. No one ever said, I cant work with him/her; \nIll work somewhere else but not there. It was just inspiring to see \npeople work together so well, and it resulted in 169 kids being \ninvolved with teams in four different age groups the first year. Why \nwas all this so wonderful? Because we were new and desperately \ncommitted to making this project go. But much more importantly, we \nhadnt had the experience of working out the life process in that \nsituation up until then.  \u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, the situation was different, and two years later, we \nwere at it full blast.

    "words": "Holocaust survivors launch new campaign to show how 'it started with \nwords'\u0014\n\"Sadly enough, 75 years after the Holocaust, this is a time to remind \npeople what words can do, one survivor said.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 8, 2021 By Rachel Elbaum\u0014\n\u0014\nLONDON  Abe Foxman was a year old when the Nazis ordered his parents \nto report to the Jewish ghetto in Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1941.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis nanny, a Catholic, told them to leave the child with her, \nexpecting that they would be back several weeks later.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoxmans stay with her ended up lasting years, until his parents \nreturned. He moved to America in 1950 at the age of 10  but his \nearly life experience has never left him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a survivor, an example of what good words can lead to, Foxman, \n80, said. My nanny risked her life for four years protecting me and \nhiding me, giving me a false identity.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoxman, a former director of the Anti-Defamation League, is one of \nseveral high-profile survivors to join a new campaign, \n#ItStartedWithWords, reflecting on the origins of the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe campaign is spearheaded by the New York City-based nonprofit \nClaims Conference, which works to secure compensation for survivors \nfrom the German government. It is supported by the United Nations and \nHolocaust museums around the world, and is being launched on the \nJewish communitys Holocaust Remembrance Day on Thursday.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the new drive for awareness comes as polls show an increase in \nanti-Semitism around the world, as well as a lack of awareness among \nadults under 40 about the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Claims Conference polled 1,000 adults in what it said was the \nfirst 50-state survey of Holocaust knowledge among millennials and \nGeneration Z. It showed that nearly half the respondents could not \nname a single one of the concentration camps or ghettos established \nduring World War II. More than half were unable to identify the \nAuschwitz-Birkenau death camp, and 11 percent believed that Jews \ncaused the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------\u0014\nHate and silence led to murder: Auschwitz survivor's warning to the \nworld\u0014\nJAN. 24, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apartment manager came out and screamed at me, Jewish children \nare not allowed to play with our children, Charlotte Knobloch, 88, \nsaid. I didnt even know what Jews were.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe push for the campaign came from survivors, the youngest of whom \nare now in their late 70s and worried that the lessons of the \nHolocaust are now being forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a politicization, there is a lack of truth, lies abate, \nthere is no consensus on civility, no one listens to each other. All \ntaboos have been broken on respect and tolerance, Foxman said. \nSadly enough, 75 years after the Holocaust, this is a time to remind \npeople what words can do.\u0014",

    "words": "5 Insights for Interpreting the Deaths of Ananias and Sapphira  \u0014\n ________________________________________\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5 is difficult. It strikes \nmany readers as harsh, a return to Old Testament retribution. Why \nthis swift act of judgment? Why no opportunity of for repentance and \nrestoration?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo amount of commentary will ever take the edge off this passageand \nthat may be the point.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelow I offer five insights for unlocking why Luke, under the \nSpirits inspiration, may have included this story in Acts. My goal \nisnt to send you away with every question answered (though these \ninsights helped me with mine), but to leave you with a new question \ndrawn from the text itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Ananias and Sapphira are a foil\u0014\n\u0014\nIn all the shock and awe of the couples fate, its easy to forget \nthe first word in the story: But. (The chapter division certainly \ndoesnt help, either.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnanias and Sapphiras deceit and greed stand in contrast to the \nsincerity and generosity of the community of faith (4:3237). Read \n5:111 and then go back and read the paragraph before, and a sense of \nsadness may come upon you. There is euphoria and utopia in the scene \ndescribed. One heart and soul, everything in common, not a needy \nperson among them.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut a man named Ananias . . . A dark cloud invades the scene. Greed \nand deceit enter the community like a virus. Amid the glorious \nexpansion of the church, Ananias and Sapphira sneak in as a threat.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote, too, that Sapphira falls down dead at Peters feet (5:10), \nwhereas Joseph brought all his money and laid it at the apostles \nfeet (4:37). The generous disciple held Gods authority in high \nesteem and showed it by laying his possessions at his appointed \nmessengers feet. Ananias and Sapphira did not, and God made his \nauthority known by laying them down.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. There are strong parallels to Joshua 7\u0014\n\u0014\nCommentators are quick to point out parallels, whether intended by \nLuke or not, to the story of Achan in Joshua 7. F.F. Bruce writes in \nthe Joshua commentary in the NICNT series:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Ananias is to the book of Acts what the story of Achan \nis to the book of Joshua. In both narratives, an act of deceit \ninterrupts the victorious progress of the people of God. It may be \nthat the author of Acts himself wished to point this comparison: when \nhe says that Ananias kept back part of the price (v. 2), he uses \nthe same Greek word as is used in the Greek version of Josh. 7:1 \nwhere it is said that the Israelites (represented by Achan) broke \nfaith by retaining for private use property that had been devoted to \nGod. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the very least, this parallel reminds us it is not out of \ncharacter for God to bring swift judgment and guard his holiness.\u0014\nBut the parallels go beyond verb choice:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tBoth events happen amid new beginnings: Israel just coming into \nthe promised land and the New Testament Church taking root in \nJerusalem. Could it be God is zealously guarding his tender shoot?\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tBoth events concern greed and possession. God had commanded the \nIsraelites not take any devoted things into the camp (Jos. 6:8), and \nthe budding church had made it a practice to sell all that they had.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tGod swiftly and corporately punishes both parties. A notable \ndifference is that Achans whole family is punished with him, whereas \nAnanias and Sapphira are punished individually.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it seems reasonable to suspect that one reason for Gods swift \njudgment here is to guard the holiness of his people and their \ngrowing community. While the narrative does not state that outright, \nthe parallels are striking, the response of the people is suggestive \n(v. 5, 11), and other passages in the New Testament command guarding \nthe churchs purity (1 Cor 3:1617; 5:15; 2 Cor 6:1418).\u0014\n \u0014\n3. Satan was trying to thwart the Spirit\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, this passage is not about Ananias and Sapphira lying to \nthe assembly and keeping back a portion for themselves. Its about \nthem lying to God (5:3, 9).\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter himself indicates that the two could have just as well kept \nback a portion for themselves; it was theirs to do with as they \npleased (v. 4). Instead, they presented it as all they had (in \ncontext, the phrase laid it at the apostles feet in verse 2 makes \nthis clear).\u0014\n\u0014\nYou see in Peters somewhat prophetic statement in verse 3, Ananias, \nwhy has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? that \nprincipalities are at war. Satan is trying to get a foothold because \nhe sees how powerfully the Spirit is moving. Whereas the community \nwas filled with the Holy Spirit (4:30), Ananias was filled with \nSatan; he has become Satans plaything.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs John Stott put it, If the devils first tactic was to destroy the \nChurch by force from without, his second was to destroy it by \nfalsehood from within.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so this is not simply a story of greed in the early Church. Its \nabout an attack on the church from withinan enemy scared and trying \nto stop the great momentum of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. The story is not normative\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing in this story, Acts, or the New Testament as a whole \nthat indicates this is a pattern for how God acts. In fact, if it \nwere, the pattern would break in Acts 8 with Simon the sorcerer. \nThough Ananias and Simons acts and motivations are slightly \ndifferent, Peters rebuke has a similar solemnity to itand death is \neven warned. However, Simon responds with a repentant heart and is \nseemingly spared.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is better to take this as a unique moment of sudden divine \njudgment. The peoples great fear indicates this was not something \nthey were accustomed to, either.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. The assemblys response matters most\u0014\n\u0014\nAs is often the case with difficult texts, there is a temptation to \nread more than is there.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut a rule of responsible Bible reading is to pay the most attention \nto what the author draws the most attention to.\u0014\n\u0014\nLukes repeated Great fear came upon all who heard it / the whole \nchurch (v. 5, 11) is the focal point. In fact, this is not the only \ntime awe is inspired in Acts (2:43; 9:31; 19:17), which reinforces \nthis reading. The phrase and the word continued to spread functions \nthis way in Acts, too (6:7; 12:24; 19:20; 13:49). Throughout Luke and \nActs, Luke often ends stories with such summative statements (see \nLuke 1:12, 65; 2:9; 5:26; 7:16; 8:25, 35, 37; 9:34, 45; 21:26).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what are we to do with our questions about this passage? I \nappreciate what Bruce says:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is no part of a commentators work to pass moral judgment on \nPeter; it would be necessary, in any case, to know much more than is \nstated in the narrative. Sapphira, for aught that is known to the \ncontrary, may have suggested the deceit to her husband. [I disagree \nwith Bruceverse 1 suggests Ananias took the initiative.] It is not \nPeters character or even Ananias and Sapphiras deserts in which \nLuke is primarily interested. What he is concerned to emphasize is \nthe reality of the Holy Spirits indwelling presence in the Church, \ntogether with the solemn practical implications of that fact.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur takeaways from the text should probably be no more and no less \nthan that of the people who witnessed the event: fear and awe. God is \na holy God who vanquishes evil and zealously defends his holiness. \nHis judgments are his, and he only makes some of them known.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did God strike down Ananias and Sapphira rather than give them a \nchance to repent? How is it that Satan filled Ananias heart to lie \n(v. 3) but that Ananias also contrived the sin himself (v. 4)? Why \ndidnt Peter show the same grace toward Ananias and Sapphira that he \nwas shown for his deceit and denial of the Lord (Matt 26:69-75)?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not know. The text does not speak to these questions, though \nother passages may help us find answers.\u0014",

    "words": "Im pro-life, but I cant support this\u0014\n\u0014\nLINDSAY BERGSTROM  |  JUNE 18, 2021  Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me start by saying this: I am pro-life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro-life for the unborn. I am pro-life for the migrant children \nflooding our borders seeking refuge from the atrocities in their own \ncountries. I am pro-life for their parents who risked everything to \nsend them or bring them here.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro-life for the millions of undocumented workers in our country \nwho help make our country run, but who are afraid to avail themselves \nof needed help because of the fear of deportation. And Im pro-life \nfor their children, brought here but not able to get onto a path to \ncitizenship.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro-life for the prisoners on death row who will not have a \nchance for redemption, or worse yet to be rescued from a false \nverdict that placed them there in the first place. I am pro-life for \nthe prisoners suffering and dying in un-airconditioned cells all over \nour country.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro-life for the victims of war, and that includes those ordered \nto fight them who come home often broken and forgotten. I am pro-life \nfor those who suffer in poverty. I am pro-life for those being abused \nand discriminated against. I am pro-life for the planet we are slowly \nusing up for our own selfish ends without regard for the stewardship \nentrusted to us by our Creator or the future of our children and \ngrandchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro Black lives and blue lives and brown lives and pink lives \nand purple lives and green lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pro-life. All of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I find it hypocritical when people who claim to be pro-life have \nno regard for any of these things but the unborn. To me that isnt \npro-life. Thats just anti-abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nI read with a pit in my stomach the resolution passed by the Southern \nBaptist Convention this week calling for the immediate abolition of \nabortion without exception or compromise. Not because Im \npro-abortion, but because I am pro-life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a harsh statement. We affirm that the murder of preborn \nchildren is a crime against humanity that must be punished equally \nunder the law. But what they are really saying is that the life of \nthe mother doesnt matter to them at all, no matter the circumstances \nupon which she became pregnant or if it kills her giving birth. Only \nthe unborn matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nI find it hypocritical when people who claim to be pro-life have no \nregard for any of these things but the unborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlus, I find it interesting that those who decry abortion and want to \nmake it illegal and punish those who do it also seem to pretend that \nwomen get pregnant all by themselves. What about the men who got them \npregnant? Where is the call for their accountability? Shouldnt they \nalso bear the brunt of condemnation and punishment too?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis issue is not as black and white as many would like to think. It \nis more nuanced and complicated, and our laws and our dealing with \nthose who have made that difficult choice should reflect that. I have \nknown women who had to make that choice, and I know the agony with \nwhich they made it. Contrary to popular belief, it is rarely done \nlightly.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo if we truly want to end abortion, then we must work on the root \ncauses. We must help those who cant afford contraception to get it. \nThat means supporting those organizations that provide such a service.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must educate our children about sex and help them understand the \nbeautiful gift and the awesome responsibility it is, explaining the \nrisks of unprotected sex and the consequences that can result.\u0014",

But when the land \nwhere the school once sat was returned to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian \nTribe of Michigan in 2010 by the state, the tribes researchers \nuncovered a more extensive history of the federal government's \nviolence: records confirming the deaths of 227 children while at \nMount Pleasant. The search for their remains is still underway.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effort to figure out what happened to those children illustrates \nthe challenge the Department of the Interior faces in its recently \nannounced investigation of the more than 350 Native American boarding \nschools that operated in the United States for more than a century.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial School in Michigan.Collins & \nWightman / Library of Congress\u0014\nThe hard part is investigating the land and understanding what that \nboarding school did, said Shannon O'Loughlin, chief executive of the \nAssociation on American Indian Affairs, a nonprofit cultural group, \nand a citizen of the Choctaw Nation. Thousands of children lived, \nworked and died in these schools, far away from their own homes, \nOLoughlin said. And time has passed.\u0014\n\u0014\nCanada offers a grim preview of what the Interior Departments \ninvestigation might find: In the last month, the mass graves of more \nthan 1,500 children have been found on the grounds of seven former \nresidential schools in Canada. The staggering number of stolen \nchildren found at just those few institutions hints at the magnitude \nof what is to come as more grounds are investigated and more tribes \nlocate their lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaginaw Chippewa tribe uncovers death records of 227 Indigenous \nchildren\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the U.S., the investigation announced last month by Interior \nSecretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first \nIndigenous person to lead a Cabinet agency, aims to determine the \nscope and impact of the countrys Indian Boarding School Policy. The \ninvestigation seeks to gather information on the decades of \ninstitutionalized, federally funded cultural assimilation that has \nled to a host of negative outcomes for survivors and their families, \nfrom mental health issues to the loss of entire communal generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nTribes are bracing for a reckoning that many see as long overdue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth needs to be heard from the perspective of those who were \nharmed, said Christine McCleave, the CEO of the National Native \nAmerican Boarding School Healing Coalition and a citizen of the \nTurtle Mountain Ojibwe Nation. There needs to be some element of \njustice or transformation when assessing the impacts and the harms \nand the damage that was done and how to restore things that were \ntaken or broken.\u0014\n \u0014\nPeople gather and shoes are left in Edmonton, Alberta, on May 31 in \nrecognition of the discovery of more than 200 children's remains at \nthe site of a former residential school in Kamloops, British \nColumbia. Jason Franson / AP file\u0014\n\u0014\nThe endeavor acknowledges a truth Indigenous peoples across North \nAmerica have known for generations: that the governments of Canada \nand the U.S. didnt just take the culture of the Indigenous children \nthat both countries attempted to assimilate through boarding schools. \nIn countless cases, they also took these childrens lives, each one \nrepresenting a stolen generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndian boarding school survivors experiences  oral histories \ncollected by nonprofits in recent decades  have documented rampant \ninstances of sexual and physical abuse, psychological trauma and \ndeaths of children in facilities run by churches and the federal \ngovernment. In some instances, children died from sickness, according \nto government documents, but survivors allege that there were other \ndeaths due to abuse and neglect that schools did not report.\u0014\n\u0014\nStories of children being beaten for speaking their language, having \ntheir heads shaved and being forced to use the Bible as a way to \nunderstand how their culture was barbaric have been passed down \nthrough generations of Indigenous families. In many cases, the abuse \ncaused survivors to sever their ties with their Native culture and \nhistory altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe schools were part of a broader push to erase Indigenous cultures, \na step in the colonization of North America. The United Nations \ndefinition of genocide includes \"forcibly transferring\" the children \nof one group to another group.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut any national reckoning on the atrocities wont happen easily. \nResearchers and tribal leaders say that not only did the government \ntry for decades to cover its tracks, but shortcomings in federal law \nraise serious concerns about how tribal nations will repatriate the \nremains of their lost children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarely more than a third of the government records for Indian \nboarding schools that operated in the U.S. have been located, \naccording to the National Native American Boarding School Healing \nCoalition, a nonprofit organization that advocates for a truth and \nreconciliation process for the survivors of Indian boarding schools. \nMany documents were intentionally destroyed, while others exist in \nuniversity archives and other historical collections, making finding \nthem labor-intensive, especially for tribes that lack the research \nstaff.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Interiors investigation will seek to identify the children who \ndid not return home from boarding schools and their tribal \naffiliations, giving tribal nations an opportunity to not only \nunderstand the impact on their communities, but to also begin the \nprocess of repatriation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if the Interiors investigation manages to find records for most \nof the missing children, federal law makes finding their remains and \nbringing them home another problem entirely.\u0014\n\u0014\n'We are treating this like a crime scene': 751 graves found near \nCanada Indigenous school\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, a federal \nlaw, was passed in 1990 to stop the theft of cultural artifacts and \nhuman remains from graves and burial and community sites. But the law \nwas designed to regulate theft by universities, museums and \ncollectors, not to address the governments role in genocide, or the \nlegal pathway to healing.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only does the law have no provisions for the protection of \nunmarked graves, like the ones being uncovered in Canada and the U.S. \n it also has no mechanism to require private landowners (like the \nRoman Catholic Church, which still owns many of the former boarding \nschool sites) to cooperate with tribes or federal authorities in the \nrepatriation of remains.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has to be legislation that applies equally, regardless of who \nowns the property that those children are buried on, said \nO'Loughlin, of the Association on American Indian Affairs. I dont \ncare if the church owns it, or Walmart or the feds. It should all be \ntreated the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the absence of a federal law governing Native American remains on \nstate or privately owned land, state laws will govern the path \nforward. One of the major concerns, OLoughlin said, is that many \nstates do not have laws regulating the discovery of unmarked graves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. governments campaign to destroy the cultural identity of \nIndigenous children and indoctrinate them with Christian beliefs \nstarted in 1879 with the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in \nPennsylvania and lasted into the 1990s. Over these decades, the \nIndian Boarding School Policy established 367 schools across the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Docucments/Indian Board School Hurdles\u0014",

    "title": "IS THE TRINITY IN THE BIBLE OR JUST IN THE CREEDS?",
    "words": "Scott Swain: Is the Trinity in the Bible or Only the Creeds? \u0014\n 29 Sep 2021 \u0014\n \u0014\n In this excerpt adapted from The Trinity and the Bible, a new Lexham \nPress book on Trinitarian theology that Matthew Levering calls \nrichly rewarding, Scott R. Swain explores the relationship between \nthe Trinity in the Bible and the creeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is the product of the triune God through which he \n(mysteriously) adumbrates and attests his self-presentation to his \npeople. This, in part, is what it means to affirm that the Bible is \nin the Trinity. Turning toward our focal question about how the \nTrinity is in the Bible requires that we attend more closely to the \nmode of Gods self-presentation in holy Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Trinity does not present himself to us in holy Scripture in the \nspecific words of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. Some, of \ncourse, claim this as evidence that the Trinity does not present \nhimself to us in any form in the Bible and that the Churchs \nTrinitarian dogma is the product of later, extrabiblical influences \non its thinking, life, and liturgy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilhelm Bousset argued that it was only when the Church had forgotten \nits Jewish monotheistic roots that it could, under the influences of \nits Hellenistic context, affirm the deity of Jesus Christ. The \nChurchs Trinitarian dogma, according to this view, is a work of the \nGreek Spirit on the soil of the Gospel, to use Adolf von Harnacks \nfamous description. Martin Hengel and others have undermined \nBoussets sharp distinction between an early Palestinian form of \nChristianity and a later Hellenized form. Richard Bauckham and Larry \nHurtado, representatives of what Hengel dubbed the new history of \nreligions school, have further discredited Boussets theory, \ndemonstrating that the early Church identified Jesus with and \nworshiped Jesus as the one true God of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suggestion that Greek philosophical influences drove the church \nto a Trinitarian confession is, at any rate, highly implausible. As \nMark Edwards observes, The paradoxical notion of three persons, each \nidentical with the one God but none identical with the other two, is \none that no philosopher would have permitted to ensnare him if he \nwere entirely free to choose his own premises. Something else must \nhave pressed the church to confess a triune God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church confesses the Trinity on the basis of holy Scripture. If \nwe admit, though, that the Trinity does not present himself to us in \nthe Bible in creedal form, where does that leave us? And what is the \nrelationship between the biblical form of Gods triune \nself-presentation and the creedal form of the churchs Trinitarian \nconfession?\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent studies suggest different ways of thinking about the presence \nof the Trinity in the Bible. According to Ben Witherington and Laura \nIce, the New Testament provides raw data that the Church later \nsynthesizes in the form of a developed doctrine of the Trinity. \u0014\nMatthew Levering appeals to Witherington and Ices metaphor to \ndescribe the Trinitarian theology of Thomas Aquinas. According to \nLevering, Aquinas draws upon the developed doctrine as elaborated \nby the Fathers and by his medieval predecessors and as enunciated by \nthe Churchs creedal formulations and sapientially illumines the \nraw data of the New Testaments revelation of the Trinity . . . with \ncontemplative clarity that, by purifying our knowing, crystallizes \n(as it were) the steps of the mystical dance revealed in Christ who, \nthrough the Spirit, invites our participation in the inexhaustible \nlife of the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Trinity is in the New Testament, according to Fee, not as fully \ndeveloped doctrine but as experienced reality.\u0014\nEmploying a slightly different idiom, Gordon Fee describes Paul as a \nlatent Trinitarian, whose experience of God through Christ and the \nSpirit affords him new and expanded ways of talking about God as \nSaviorwhile at the same time rigorously maintaining his monotheism. \nThe Trinity is in the New Testament, according to Fee, not as fully \ndeveloped doctrine but as experienced reality. While Fee agrees \nthat Pauls experience of the Trinity informs later creedal \nstatements of the doctrine, he warns us not to spend our labors on \nthe ontological questions in such a way as to lose the essential \nnarrative about God and salvation that raised those questions in the \nfirst place. \u0014\n\u0014\n Is the Trinity in the Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Witherington and Ice, Levering, and Fee, then, the \nTrinity is in the Bible in an undeveloped form. On this construal, \nthe task of Trinitarian theology in relation to the Bible is to \ndevelop what is undeveloped without destroying the natural narrative \nhabitat that generated the undeveloped form of the doctrine in the \nfirst place.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a short essay devoted to Pauls teaching about God in Romans and \nGalatians, Richard Hays suggests an alternative construal of the \npresence of the Trinity in the Bible. While Hays acknowledges that \nPaul did not know the doctrinal formulae worked out in the \nfourth-century Churchs theological reflection about the one God in \nthree persons, he argues that Pauls prayers, praises, and \nnarratives about . . . God point to the same complex reality with \nwhich the ecumenical councils later grappled. The relationship \nbetween the mode of the Trinitys presence in the Bible and the mode \nof the Trinitys presence in the creeds is not, according to Hays, a \nrelationship between raw data and developed doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrawing on the work of Frances Young and David Ford, Hays argues that \nthe relationship between the Trinity in the Bible and the Trinity in \nthe creeds is similar to the relationship between the fluent speaker \nof a language and the theoretical grammar of that language. As Hays \nexplains, A person does not need to know theoretical grammar \nconstructs in order to speak grammatically. In fact, it is the \nreverse: Grammar is developed to explain the linguistic practices \nof those who speak a complex language with unreflective fluency. In \nthe same way, the later doctrine of the Trinity is an attempt to \ndescribe and analyze the way in which Jesus Christ and the Spirit had \nbecome intrinsic to Pauls way of referring to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHayss metaphor correlates well with Oswald Bayers conception of \ntheology as a grammar of the language of Holy Scripture. \nTrinitarian theology, according to this conception, is commentary on \nand reflective analysis of the primary and normatively fluent \nTrinitarian language of holy Scripture. . . . What we have in the \nBible is not merely an experience of the Trinity or the as yet \nundeveloped raw data of Trinitarian reflection. What we have in the \nBible is well-formed Trinitarian discourse: primary, normative, \nfluent. More specifically, we have the triune Gods self-naming in \nthe form of the Spirit-inspired prophetic and apostolic testimony to \nthat self-naming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Trinitarian theology of the Churchs creeds, proclamation, and \nliturgy, therefore, is not a refinement of or an improvement on Gods \nself-naming in Scripture. It is rather the Churchs attempt, in \nprayerful thought and speech, to follow the divine Word as it leads \nus out of the misery of idolatry into the happiness that lies before \nus in the vision of the triune God.\u0014",

    "title": "INTERPRETING THE TOWER OF BABEL STORY",
    "words": "Interpreting the Tower of Babel story   (A far right exposition)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous Tower of Babel story and how it was built s about much \nmore than an ill-fated construction project and language confusion. \nIts at the heart of the Old Testament worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nBabylon was where people sought to make a name (shem) for \nthemselves by building a tower that reached to the heavens, the \nrealm of the gods. The city is cast as the source of sinister \nactivity and knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis 11:19 reads:\u0014\n\u0014\nNow the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as \npeople migrated from the east they found a plain in the land of \nShinar and settled there. And they said to each other, Come, let us \nmake bricks and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone \nand they had tar for mortar. And they said, Come, let us build \nourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the heavens. And \nlet us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face \nof the whole earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that humankind \nwas building. And Yahweh said, Behold, they are one people with one \nlanguage, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. So now \nnothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them. Come, let \nus go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not \nunderstand each others language. So Yahweh scattered them from \nthere over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the \ncity. Therefore its name was called Babel, for there Yahweh confused \nthe language of the whole earth, and there Yahweh scattered them over \nthe face of the whole earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid God act alone?\u0014\n\u0014\nYoull notice right away that theres the same sort of plural \nexhortation going on in verse 7 as you find in Genesis 1:26:\u0014\nThen God said, Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, \nso that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the \nsky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the \ncreatures that move along the ground. (italics added)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe verse has Yahweh proclaiming, Let us go down and confuse their \nlanguage. As was the case in Genesis 1:26, the plural announcement \nis followed by the actions of only one being, Yahweh: So Yahweh \nscattered them (11:8).\u0014\nThe extrapolation of the Tower of Babel story\u0014\n\u0014\nIts at this point that most Bible readers presume theres nothing \nmore to think about. Thats because other Old Testament passages that \nspeak of this event tend to be omitted from the discussion. The most \nimportant of these is Deuteronomy 32:89 (ESV):\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,\u0014\nwhen he divided mankind,\u0014\nhe fixed the borders of the peoples\u0014\naccording to the number of the sons of God.\u0014\nBut the LORDs portion is his people,\u0014\nJacob his allotted heritage.\u0014\n \u0014\nGod dispossess the nations\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy 32:89 describes how Yahwehs dispersal of the nations at \nBabel resulted in his disinheriting those nations as his people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the Old Testament equivalent of Romans 1:1825, a familiar \npassage wherein God gave [humankind] over to their persistent \nrebellion. The statement in Deuteronomy 32:9 that the LORDs portion \nis his people, Jacob his allotted heritage tips us off that a \ncontrast in affection and ownership is intended.\u0014\n\u0014\nYahweh in effect decided that the people of the worlds nations were \nno longer going to be in relationship with him. He would begin anew. \nHe would enter into covenant relationship with a new people that did \nnot yet exist: Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe implications of this decision and this passage are crucial to \nunderstanding much of whats in the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost English Bibles do not read according to the number of the sons \nof God in Deuteronomy 32:8. Rather, they read according to the \nnumber of the sons of Israel. The difference derives from \ndisagreements between manuscripts of the Old Testament. Sons of God \nis the correct reading, as is now known from the Dead Sea Scrolls.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, you dont need to know all the technical reasons for why the \nsons of God reading in Deuteronomy 32:89 is what the verse \noriginally said. You just need to think a bit about the wrong \nreading, the sons of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy 32:89 harks back to events in the Tower of Babel story  \nan event that occurred before the call of Abraham, the father of the \nnation of Israel. This means that the nations of the earth were \ndivided at Babel before Israel even existed as a people.\u0014\nIt would make no sense for God to divide up the nations of the earth \naccording to the number of the sons of Israel if there was no \nIsrael.\u0014\n \u0014\nWhat happened to the other nations?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does it mean that they were apportioned as an inheritance \naccording to the number of the sons of God?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs odd as it sounds, the rest of the nations were placed under the \nauthority of members of Yahwehs divine council. Whereas in \nDeuteronomy 32:89 God apportioned or handed out the nations to the \nsons of God, here we are told God allotted the gods to those \nnations. God decreed, in the wake of Babel, that the other nations he \nhad forsaken would have other gods besides himself to worship. The \nother nations were assigned these lesser gods as a judgment from the \nMost High, Yahweh.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat this interpretation is sound is made clear by an explicit \nparallel passage, Deuteronomy 4:1920. There Moses says to the \nIsraelites:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd do this so that you do not lift your eyes toward heaven and \nobserve the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of the \nheaven, and be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things \nthat Yahweh your God has allotted to all of the peoples under all of \nthe heaven. But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out from the \nfurnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to him, as \nit is this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy 4:1920 is the other side of Gods punitive coin. It is \nas though God was saying, If you dont want to obey me, Im not \ninterested in being your godIll match you up with some other god.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 82, where we started our divine council discussion, echoes this \ndecision. That psalm has Yahweh judging other elohim, sons of the \nMost High, for their corruption in administering the nations. The \npsalm ends with the psalmist pleading, Rise up, O God, judge the \nearth, because you shall inherit all the nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nLinking Babel to Genesis 6\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem that Gods response at the Tower of Babel incident was \noverly severe. But consider the context. The point is not that Yahweh \nwas a glorified building inspector. Gods were perceived to live on \nmountains. The Tower of Babel story is regarded by all scholars as \none of Mesopotamias famous man-made sacred mountainsa ziggurat.\u0014\n\u0014\nZiggurats were divine abodes, places where Mesopotamians believed \nheaven and earth intersected. The nature of this structure makes \nevident the purpose in building itto bring the divine down to earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biblical writer wastes no time in linking this act to the earlier \ndivine transgression of Genesis 6:14:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen human beings began to increase in number on the earth and \ndaughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters \nof humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. \nThen the Lord said, My Spirit will not contend with[ humans forever, \nfor they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nephilim were on the earth in those daysand also afterwardwhen \nthe sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by \nthem. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat passage sought to portray the giant quasi-divine Babylonian \nculture heroes (the apkallus) who survived the flood as men of \nrenown or, more literally, men of the name [shem]. Those who built \nthe Tower of Babel wanted to do so to make a name [shem] for \nthemselves. The building of the Tower of Babel meant perpetuating \nBabylonian religious knowledge and substituting the rule of Babels \ngods for rule by Yahweh.\u0014\n \u0014\nYahwehs intention to start over\u0014\n\u0014\nYahweh would have none of it. After the flood God had commanded \nhumanity once again to be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth \n(Gen 9:1). These words reiterated the original Edenic intention.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut instead of obeying and having Yahweh be their god, the people \ngathered to build the tower. The theological messaging of the story \nis clear. Humanity had shunned Yahweh and his plan to restore Eden \nthrough them, so he would shun them and start again.\u0014\nWhile the decision was harsh, the other nations are not completely \nforsaken. Yahweh disinherited the nations, and in the very next \nchapter of Genesis, he calls Abram out ofyou guessed itMesopotamia. \nAgain, this is not accidental. Yahweh would take a man from the heart \nof the rebellion and make a new nation, Israel. But in his covenant \nwith Abram, God said that all the nations of the earth would be \nblessed through Abram, through his descendants (Gen. 12:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe covenant language reveals that it was Gods intention, right on \nthe heels of his decision to punish the nations, that the Israelites \nwould serve as a conduit for their return to the true God. This is \none of the reasons Israel is later called a kingdom of priests \n(Exod. 19:6). Israel would be in covenant with the God of gods and \nthe Lord of lords (Deut. 10:17). Those disinherited would be in \nspiritual bondage to the corrupt sons of God. But Israel would be a \nconduit, a mediator. Yahweh would leave a spiritual bread-crumb trail \nback to himself. That path would wind through Israel and, ultimately, \nIsraels messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the fateful decision at Babel onward, the story of the Old \nTestament is about Israel versus the disinherited nations, and Yahweh \nversus the corrupt, rebel gods of those nations. The division of the \nnations and their allotment under other elohim is behind the scenes \nin all sorts of places in biblical history.\u0014\n \u0014\nPentecost: Babel revisited?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day of Pentecost is an event remembered by millions of Christians \neach year. Although Acts 2 is one of the more familiar passages in \nthe New Testament outside the Gospels, what the passage describes as \nhappening that day definitely sounds strange.\u0014\nAnd when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in \nthe same place. And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came \nfrom heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. And \ndivided tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of \nthem. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to \nspeak in other languages as the Spirit gave them ability to speak out.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every \nnation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the crowd gathered \nand was in confusion, because each one was hearing them speaking in \nhis own language. And they were astounded and astonished, saying, \nBehold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how do we \nhear, each one of us, in our own native language? Parthians and Medes \nand Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, \nPontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya \ntoward Cyrene, and the Romans who were in town, both Jews and \nproselytes, Cretans and Arabswe hear them speaking in our own \nlanguages the great deeds of God! And all were amazed and greatly \nperplexed, saying to one another, What can this mean? (Acts \n2:112).\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlocking the wind and fire imagery\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wind and fire that accompanied the Spirit in the second chapter \nof Acts are similar to images in the Old Testament associated with \nGods presencethe disciples are being commissioned by God in his \ncouncil like the prophets of old.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe whirlwind is familiar from divine encounters of Elijah (2 Kings \n2:1, 11) and Job (Job 38:1; 40:6). This motif is often accompanied by \nstorm imagery, which can also include fire (Isa. 30:30). Having \nwind as an element in describing Gods presence makes sense given \nthat the Hebrew word translated wind can also be rendered \nspirit/Spirit (ruach).\u0014\n\u0014\nEzekiels commissioning is particularly instructive since not only \ndoes Yahweh come to him with a wind, but with the wind there is fire \nflashing (Ezek. 1:4). Burning fire is a familiar element of \ndivine-council throne-room scenes (e.g., Isa. 6:4, 6; Dan. 7:9). It \nis especially prominent in the appearances at Sinai (Exod. 3:2; \n19:18; 20:18; Isa. 4:5).\u0014\n\u0014\nFire in the Old Testament was an identifier of the presence of God, a \nvisible manifestation of Yahwehs glory and essence. It was also a \nway of describing divine beings in Gods service (Judg 13:20; Psa \n104:4).\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were being chosen to preach the good news of Jesus work. The \nfire connects them to the throne room. The tongues are emblematic of \ntheir speaking ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow Pentecost connects to the Tower of Babel story\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first glance there doesnt seem to be much in the Pentecost \ndescription relating back to the incident at Babel which had such \ncosmic-geographical and theological importance in the Old Testament. \nThat first glance would be mistaken.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two key terms in the passage that connect it back to Babel \nin an unmistakable way. The flaming tongues are described as \ndivided (Greek: diamerizo), and the crowd, composed of Jews from \nall the nations, is said to have been confused (Greek: suncheo).\u0014\nThe second term, suncheo (v. 6), is the same word used in the \nSeptuagint version of the Babel story in Genesis 11:7: Come, let us \ngo down and confuse [Septuagint: suncheo] their language there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe multiplicity of nations represented at Pentecost is another link \nto Babel. Each nation had a national language. More importantly, all \nthose nations referred to in Acts 2:911 had been disinherited by \nYahweh when they were divided.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe other word of importance (diamerizo; v. 3) is also used in the \nSeptuagint, but not in Genesis 11. It is found exactly where one \nwould expect it if one were thinking in cosmic-geographical \ntermsDeuteronomy 32:8 (Septuagint: When the Most High divided \n[diamerizo] the nations, when he scattered humankind, he fixed the \nboundaries of the nations). This is a strong indication that Luke is \ndrawing on the Septuagint, and specifically the Tower of Babel story \nin Genesis 11 and Deuteronomy 32:89, to describe the events on \nPentecost. What happened there has some relationship to what happened \nat Babelbut what is it?\u0014\n\u0014\nBringing the nations home\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Pentecost the tongues are divided (diamerizo) or, perhaps more \ncoherently, distributed among the disciples as they are \ncommissioned to preach the good news to the throngs at Pentecost.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Jews gathered in Jerusalem for the celebration heard and embraced \nthe news of Jesus and his resurrection, Jews who embraced Jesus as \nmessiah would carry that message back to their home countriesthe \nnations. Babels disinheritance was going to be rectified by the \nmessage of Jesus, the second Yahweh incarnate, and his Spirit. The \nnations would again be his.\u0014",

    "title": "INDIGENOUS CULTURES EXISTED PRIOR TO 1492-PART 3",
    "words": "Indigenous cultures and systems existed throughout North America \nprior to 1492.\u0014\nMitch Randall\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book, 1491, Charles C. Mann chronicles the nuances and \ncomplexities of Indigenous cultures and systems, which involved \ncomplex social and economic structures for governance, industry and \ntrade.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the problems, past and present, regarding Americas history \nwith Native peoples stem from our inability to recognize these \ncultures before Columbus arrival.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndigenous peoples created a vast and complex system of \ntransportation across the entire continent, for example, but European \nsettlers were unable to see these systems due to their cultural \nblindness.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust because settlers could not see the Indigenous systems does not \nmean they did not exist. One could say the same about systemic racism \ntoday  just because white eyes cannot see it does not mean its not \npresent.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch blindness resulted in the Doctrine of Discovery, which offered \nspiritual, political and legal justification for Christian monarchs \nto colonize non-Christian lands.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlessed by the Catholic Church, this ideology declared the supremacy \nof European Christian cultures over all others. It justified European \ncolonization without setting ethical or moral guidelines, which led \nto the genocide of Indigenous people around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Indigenous population of the Americas was around 60 million \ninhabitants before 1492. The numbers began to decline drastically \nafter Columbus arrival, with scholars estimating that 90% died by \nthe early 1600s.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most of the history connected to the Doctrine of Discovery and \ncolonialism relates to the genocide of Ingenious peoples, there are a \nfew exceptions to celebrate.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnglican cleric Roger Williams interactions with the Indigenous \npeoples of what is now Massachusetts is one positive example.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams landed at the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1631, quickly \nrealizing that the religious persecution he fled in England existed \nwithin the colonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to the Puritans state religion, Williams wrote in a \npamphlet, Enforced uniformity confounds civil and religious liberty \nand denies the principles of Christianity and civility. No man shall \nbe required to worship or maintain a worship against his will.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams believed so strongly in the freedom of conscience and \nreligious liberty for all that he extended such rights to the \nIndigenous peoples.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother example is the framing of the U.S. Constitution, especially \nthe first 16 words in the Bill of Rights  Congress shall make no \nlaw respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese words should be championed by every American and person of \nfaith, but we must realize the limitations initially placed on the \nU.S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights: it only applied to white \nland-owning males.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the noble ideals set forth in these founding documents, \nfollowing the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the great land theft that \nbegan in 1492 continued with renewed fervor as white settlers moved \nwest.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorian Roxanne Dunbar-Otis gave these settlers another name in her \nbook An Indigenous Peoples History of the United States: squatters.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunbar-Otis argued that history, seen through white eyes, has acted \nas though the lands across the country were free for the taking. In \nreality, European settlers forced Indigenous peoples away from their \nlands in a variety of ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the turn of the 19th century, Native peoples had lost their \nancestral lands, economies and resources, and then came the Indian \nRemoval Act of 1830.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuscogee Creeks  my people  lost over 3,500 to whooping cough, \ntyphus, dysentery, cholera and starvation, while the Cherokees lost \nmore than 5,000, on the Trail of Tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did all of this happen inside a country dedicated to freedom and \nlaw?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it came to Indigenous peoples and African slaves, another \npunitive philosophy was built upon the Doctrine of the Discovery: \nManifest Destiny. This idea declares that the United States is \ndestined by God to expand its dominion from sea to shining sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1890, an incident took place on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation \nin South Dakota that marked white dominance and revealed the limited \napplication of the Bill of Rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. government grew concerned about the Lakota Sioux who engaged \nin the Ghost Dance  an emerging religious belief and practice that \nattempted to conjure Indigenous ancestors who would help stop white \nexpansion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn early December 1890, authorities killed Lakota Chief Sitting Bull \nduring an attempt to arrest him because they wrongly assumed he was a \nGhost Dancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour days after Christmas that same year, soldiers surrounded a group \nof Ghost Dancers in Pine Ridge. This resulted in a fight and, \nultimately, a massacre of 150 Lakota Sioux (mostly women and \nchildren).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is one of the worst examples of religious persecution and \nslaughter in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nI share these stories to remind us of the dangers of conquest and \nconformity. The reason for reading and understanding events of the \npast is so that we do not repeat such mistakes today.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must be brutally honest: The nation that we know and love today \nwas built upon the genocide of Indigenous peoples and the enslavement \nof Africans. Yet, there are reasons for hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Christianity was wrongly forced upon Indigenous peoples, many \ndiscovered a kindred spirit in Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nI shed tears for my great-grandmother and other ancestral people, but \nI also recall the days of listening to Christian hymns sung in the \ntraditional languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think of churches like Hackey Creek United Methodist in Tulsa, \nOklahoma, where you can see Indigenous peoples gather for worship and \nfor lunch consisting of hominy and fry-bread.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can travel to Northern Oklahoma to visit the First Indian Baptist \nChurch of Watonga to visit with Elder Quinton Romannose as he tells \nyou how the church is ministering to the local school system.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can go to Muskogee where my friend Will Brown preaches about \nanother brown-skinned man living 2,000 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe history of the United States is filled with dark moments, but we \nmust not forget the beacons of hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious liberty and human rights for all people must continue to be \nchampioned and defended  for when one persons freedoms and rights \nare threatened, all our freedoms and rights are threatened.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me end with two quotes from the famous Wal-lam-wat-kain Chief \nJoseph, who fought western expansion for many years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe chief said, Let me be a free man, free to travel, free to stop, \nfree to work, free to trade where I choose, free to choose my own \nteachers, free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to talk, \nthink and act for myself  and I will obey every law and submit to \npenalty.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even more importantly, he offered this assessment after so many \nyears of war, All (humans) are created by the Great Spirit Chief, \nthey are all (siblings)  I believe much trouble would be saved if we \nopened our hearts more.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay it be so for all our sakes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the final article in a three-part series.\u0014",

    "words": "IGNATIUS was bishop of Antioch (in Syria) for forty years, probably \nfrom AD 67 - 106, and became a martyr. Most likely he studied under \nthe Apostle John. \u0014\n\u0014\nIgnatius was an energetic man who raised the church of Antioch to \nprominence and dominated the surrounding region. In fact, he was the \nprototype of bishops as later understood by Romedistinct from \npriests and deacons, and possessing authority over a region. Ignatius \ndemanded submission to the office of the bishop. He also is the first \nwriter known to have spoken of the church as catholic, meaning \nwhole or universal. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the reign of Trajan, Ignatius influence brought him into \ntrouble with Roman authorities. Christianity was an illegal religion. \nTrajan arrested him and sent him to Rome. It was a long and difficult \ntrip, sometimes by land, sometimes by sea. Ignatius was chained \nbetween soldiers, who treated him more cruelly the kinder he was to \nthem. At stops along the way, messengers from churches met him with \nwords of affection and sorrow. Ignatius hastily wrote letters for \nthem to take back to their congregations. These letters shed light on \nhis thinking and on church conditions at the start of the second \ncentury. So famous were they that people forged additions to support \ntheir own positions. Seven of the ones we now have are considered \ngenuine. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the letters was written to Rome, the city where Ignatius was \nto die. Ignatius convoy moved so slowly that a messenger going ahead \nhad time to get there before him. He pleaded with Romes Christians \nnot to try to save him. Nearness to the sword is nearness to God; to \nbe among the wild beasts is to be in the arms of God; only let it be \nin the name of Jesus Christ. I endure all things that I may suffer \ntogether with him, since he who became perfect man strengthens me. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe public spectacles were about to close for the day when Ignatius \nat last reached Rome. He was hustled to the arena and thrown to two \nfierce lions, who immediately devoured him. According to tradition, \nhe died on this day, 17 October 107.(We have no data on this.)\u0014",

    "title": "IS THERE SUCH A THING AS BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD?",
    "words": "Is There Such a Thing as Baptism for the Dead?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of being baptized for the dead is not biblical and Paul \nis not endorsing the idea by mentioning it in this passage of \nScripture. Paul does not approve of the practice of baptism for the \ndead; rather, he is connecting it back to the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nVivian Bricker     2021   12 Oct\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1 Corinthians 15:29, Paul declares, Now if there is no \nresurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If \nthe dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? \nFrom this passage of Scripture, one could surmise that Paul was \naffirming the existence of baptism for the dead. The concept of \nbaptism for the dead does not align with Pauls theology; therefore, \nwhy does Paul even mention it? Is there actually baptism for the dead?\u0014\n\u0014\nIs There Baptism for the Dead?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a difficult concept to understand as it is not biblical and \nmany biblical commentators are unsure of the exact meaning of baptism \nfor the dead. The overall consensus of baptism for the dead is that \nit is believed that a living person can be baptized in place of a \nloved one who has passed away in order for the deceased individual to \nobtain salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the living person making a statement of the profession of faith \nfor the deceased individual, it is supposed to entail that the \ndeceased individual has now been baptized and ultimately saved. \nThe origin of this concept seems to have been started with pagan \npractices in Ancient Greece. Sadly, this concept is still being \ntaught among cults today, such as the Church of the Latter-day \nSaints, formerly known as Mormonism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no avoiding the fact that Paul mentions the concept of \nbaptism for the dead in his famous discussion of the resurrection of \nChrist (1 Corinthians 15:1-58). Paul is not affirming this erroneous \nbelief, but rather, Paul is pointing out this belief in conjunction \nwith his overall main topic  the resurrection of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Corinthian church had been practicing baptism for the dead even \nthough this is not a true biblical practice. Salvation is only \nobtained by placing faith in Christ when a person is still alive \n(Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28). Once a person has passed away, there \nare no second chances.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are all given one life to live, and we each have to choose \npersonally whether or not we will accept Jesus as our Savior. Placing \nfaith in Jesus is a personal decision that each person has to make \nfor themselves. Just like you cannot place faith in Jesus for me, I \ncannot place faith in Jesus for you.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians struggle with knowing that many of their loved ones \nhave not placed faith in Jesus, but we cannot place faith for them. \nEvery person has to freely place faith in Jesus on their own. We can \npray for our loved ones to know Christ, but we cannot force them to \naccept Him nor can we place faith for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, after a person dies, we cannot undergo baptism for the \ndead in order to provide salvation for a dead loved one. If an \nunbeliever dies, they will not go to be with God in Heaven. Due to \nour sins, each person who does not trust in Jesus for salvation will \ngo to hell when they die.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce a person passes away, there is nothing we can do to warrant that \nindividual to obtain salvation. The best thing we can do to help our \nloved ones who are not believers is to pray for them and to continue \nto tell them the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nhe concept of being baptized for the dead is not biblical and Paul is \nnot endorsing the idea by mentioning it in this passage of Scripture. \nPaul does not approve of the practice of baptism for the dead; \nrather, he is connecting it back to the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, Paul is saying, Why would anyone be baptized for the \ndead if Christ was not resurrected? Paul was utilizing this false \nbelief that the Corinthians were practicing pointing to the bigger \nissue at hand, which was his discourse on the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre There Present-Day Practices?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs previously mentioned, the Church of the Latter-day Saints still \npractices baptism for the dead. They base this practice on the \nmisinterpretation of Pauls words in 1 Corinthians 15:29. This is not \nsurprising due to the fact that the Church of the Latter-day Saints \nendorses many practices that have no biblical proof nor biblical \ngrounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church of the Latter-day Saints is a cult and believers need to \nabstain from practices utilized in this cult, such as the idea of \nbaptism for the dead. Baptism for the dead is not true as the Bible \nnever tells us that individuals can be baptized for the dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs much as many believers wish they could save their lost loved ones \nwho have passed away, we simply cannot. Each individual has to make \ntheir own decision while they are alive if they are going to trust in \nJesus for salvation or not.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is depressing to know that many of our loved ones have passed away \nwithout trusting in Jesus, but we cannot do anything to help them \nobtain salvation now. God is full of mercy and love; however, He is \nalso holy, righteous, and true. For the Lord is righteous, he loves \njustice; the upright will see his face (Psalm 11:7).\u0014\n\u0014\nGod has given each of us the chance to obtain salvation by placing \nfaith in Jesus Christ. For God so loved the world that he gave his \none and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but \nhave eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to \ncondemn the world, but to save the world through him (John 3:16-17).\u0014\n\u0014\nHe desires all people to be saved, including your loved ones (1 \nTimothy 2:4). Since God has freely shown us what we must do to \ninherit salvation, we should all turn to God and accept His free gift \nof salvation by placing faith in Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Does This Matter?\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce we die, we will not get a second chance. Nobody will be able to \nparticipate in baptism for the dead for us after we die because \nbaptism for the dead will not save a person.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism for the dead is taught within several false belief systems, \nwhich means this practice should not be practiced among believers. \nThere is no salvation apart from an individual person personally \nplacing faith in Jesus by believing that He died for their sins, was \nburied, and rose again.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I \npreached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your \nstand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I \npreached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I \nreceived I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died \nfor our sins according to the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that \nhe was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 \nCorinthians 15:1-4).\u0014",

    "words": "IGNATIUS DISCOVERED THE DANGER OF OPPOSING AN EMPEROR\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a patriarch in Constantinople, seat of the Roman Empire, could \nbe costly. John Chrysostom, for example, was exiled for upsetting an \nempress, and killed by forced marches. Patriarch Ignatius of \nConstantinople did not suffer quite so severely, but he barely \nescaped death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn near the end of the eighth century, he was the son of Emperor \nMichael I and Procopia, who named him Nicetas. When Leo the Armenian \ndeposed Michael I, he feared that Nicetas might attempt to claim the \nthrone so had him castrated and sent to a monastery. Nicetas took the \nname Ignatius and voluntarily embraced the religious life, eventually \nfounding three monasteries and becoming an abbot.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo was murdered by a conspiracy led by Michael II. No assassination \nor revolt followed Michaels reign and his son, Theophilos, succeeded \nhim. The reign then passed peaceably to Theophiloss son Michael III, \nwho ascended the throne in 842. As he was underage, his mother, \nTheodora, was named regent and co-ruler. Upon the death of Patriarch \nMethodius five years later, Theodora exerted her influence to have \nIgnatius raised to the Easts most prestigious and powerful church \npostPatriarch of Constantinople. \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael III fell under the influence of his maternal uncle, Caesar \nBardas, who encouraged him in debauchery. (Caesar was his name, not \nhis rank.) Michael wanted his mother to resign the regency and asked \nIgnatius to assist him in forcing her into a convent. Ignatius \nrefused, earning the emperors enmity. Theodora abdicated of her own \naccord. Nonetheless the enmity between emperor and patriarch simmered \nand even increased. Bardas was living in incest with his own \ndaughter-in-law, Eudocia, causing Ignatius to refuse him Communion. \u0014\n\u0014\nBardas blamed a minor revolt on Ignatius, further poisoning the \nemperor against him. On this day, 23 November 857, Michael deposed \nand banished Ignatius. He made Photius, a scholarly layman, the \nPatriarch in Ignatiuss place. Pope Nicholas got involved, claiming \nprecedence over the Patriarch of Constantinople and trying to extend \nhis authority over the Eastern Church. He took Ignatiuss side, \nalthough his own legates to the East agreed that Ignatius had been \nproperly deposed. Two church councils in the east pushed back against \nRome, declaring Ignatiuss deposition legitimate. Meanwhile Bardas \ncontinued to allege crimes against Ignatius and finally obtained an \norder for his execution. Ignatius escaped death by fleeing and \nhiding. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 867 the tide turned for Ignatius. Basil I, the Macedonian, \nassassinated Michael III. One of his first acts as emperor was to \ndepose Photius and replace him with Ignatius. Ignatius lived another \ndecade, peaceably occupying the office of Patriarch until his death \nin 877. He recommended Photius as his successor, and Photius returned \nas ecumenical patriarch.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "INTERPRETING SONG OF SONGS",
    "words": "Interpreting Song of Songs\u0014\n\u0014\nSong of Songs presents one of the toughest interpretive challenges in \nall of Scripture. Do we read it as a straightforward celebration of \nromance and human sexuality as God designed it? As a poetic allegory \nfor Christ and the church? As a little of both, or something in \nbetween?\u0014\n\u0014\nWriter and podcaster Aimee Byrd uses Song of Songs to anchor her \nargument in The Sexual Reformation: Restoring the Dignity and \nPersonhood of Man and Woman. Reviewing the book for CT, Dallas \nTheological Seminary professor Sandra Glahn agrees that the Bible can \npoint us to a better understanding of sexuality, but she questions \nByrds approach to biblical interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany will agree with Byrds assessment that the church needs to \nreform its understanding of Gods design for men and women, writes \nGlahn, But the path she takes from problem to solution is another \nstory. Sadly, Byrds typological method of interpreting Song of Songs \nleads her to some conclusions that run contrary to basic rules of \nword usage\u0014\n.\u0014\nDescribing the bride in the Song, Byrd points out that she has \ndoves eyes (1:15), an image the woman applies to her husband later \nin the book (5:12). Noting that the bride finds peace in her \nlovers eyes (8:10), she argues, The dove is clearly a symbol of the \nHoly Spirit. Clearly?\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, reflecting on the prominence of lilies in the book (2:12, 16; \n4:5; 5:13), Byrd says they remind us of Gods people, the church. \nAbout the brides references to myrrh (5:1, 5, 13) she writes, Myrrh \nis the perfume of the temple. Its as if she is saying that we, the \ncollective church, are on [the lovers] lips!\u0014\n\u0014\nYet none of these interpretations is anywhere near as \nstraightforward as Byrd suggests. On what basis of authority does she \nmake them? Readers never get a clear answer. The question of \nauthorial intent, Byrd argues, is not given to us. Its a Song.  \nSo why would we spend our energies probing into that when the \ntypo-symbolic reading is the plainer reading? Which only raises the \nquestion: Plainer to whom?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point, Byrd notes a parallel between the king in the Song \nbeing bound by the beloveds hair (7:5) and Jesus being bound when he \nis arrested, as recorded by John (18:24). Now, in this example, the \nauthor of the fourth Gospel does use literary layering as he borrows \nwords and images from the Song. But seeing the bound Savior in the \noriginal reference to the brides hair? It reminds me of the \noft-quoted scene in one of the Alice in Wonderland books, in which \nHumpty Dumpty tells Alice that when he uses a word, it means just \nwhat I choose it to meanneither more nor less. In response, Alice \nwonders aloud whether you can make words mean so many different \nthings.\u0014",

    "words": "IN THE RISING WATER, MARGARET WILSON CLAIMED CHRIST\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Charles I, Charles II, and James II, staunch Scottish \nPresbyterians suffered greatly. Many firmly believed no earthly king \ncould be head of the churchas the Stuart kings claimed they were. \nThat role was reserved for Jesus Christ alone. Many Scots \n(Covenanters) signed a covenant in 1638 denying that the Stuarts had \nauthority over the Scottish church. Some strict Calvinists went so \nfar as to say that it was wrong even to say God save the king! \nbecause if the king was not among those whom God had predestined for \nsalvation, that would be defying Gods will. Years of persecution and \nof warfare caused rebels to retaliate against anyone who betrayed a \nCovenanter to the government.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless persecution raged unabated in 1685. Today, 11 May 1685, \nwas made remarkable by more than one great crime, wrote historian \nThomas Babington Macaulay. Musketeers in Clydsdale executed three \nlaborers who refused to pray for the king unless he was among the \nelect. In Eskdale the Lord of Westerhall tore down the home of a \nwoman who had harbored a refugee, and his soldiers shot her teenage \nson. He died bravely, holding a Bible. I can look you in the face, \nhe said; I have done nothing of which I need be ashamed. But how \nwill you look in that day when you shall be judged by what is written \nin this book? \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the most famous of the judicial murders of this day took place at \nWigton, Scotland.  Sixty-three-year-old Margaret Lachlane and young \nMargaret Wilson, perhaps eighteen or twenty years old, were tied to \nstakes in Wigtowns mudflats to drown as the tide came in.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth could have saved themselves by repeating an oath against the \nrebel Covenanters, swearing allegiance to the king as head of the \nchurch, and promising to attend Episcopal services. The headship of \nChrist was the issue in a nutshell, so they could not comply with \nthat demand. And as they considered oaths to be against Christs \ncommand, they refused the first condition. Finally, since Episcopal \nchurches (i.e., Church of England) accepted the headship of the king, \nthey could not comply with the last condition, either. \u0014\n\u0014\nLachlane had been seized while holding a Sunday service at home \ninstead of attending the governments approved church. She was staked \nfarthest out so that her death would serve as a warning to the \nyounger woman. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilson with her siblings had defied her parents and attended \nCovenanter services held in wilderness places. As a consequence, her \nparents had been ruined by fines, but the father was still able to \nraise 100 to free a younger daughter, Agnes, arrested with Margaret. \nHe also persuaded the privy council at Edinburgh to grant a reprieve \nto the other two women (or so was later claimed) but if this was so, \nthe authorities at Wigton ignored the order.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Lachlane was losing her struggle against the water, a bystander \nasked Wilson what she saw. What do I see? she countered, Christ, \nin one of His members, wrestling there. Think you that we are the \nsufferers? No, it is Christ in us; for He sends none a warfare upon \ntheir own charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the flood rose around her she sang a psalm and quoted \nScripture. When she had passed out under the rising water, she was \nreleased, restored to consciousness, and given another chance to \nconform. At the urging of friends, she brought herself to say, May \nGod save him [the king], if He will, for it is his salvation I \ndesire. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe has said it, indeed sir, she has said it! cried the friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, who led the persecution against \nWilson, demanded she take the oath. She refused, saying, I will not; \nI am one of Christs children; let me go. Major Windram then ordered \nhis soldiers to fasten her again to the stake. And so she died. After \nthe tide retreated, the bodies of the two victims were recovered and \ninterred in a nearby cemetery.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

As I stretched at the \nstarting line, playing up to the crowd, my husband strode up, grabbed \nmy arm, and tried to pull me toward a side street. Distressed at his \nforcefulness, I yanked away, ready to demand he explain himself, when \nhis face seemed to melt.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Michael died.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis gray complexion and the way he reached for me slammed the reality \nhome. Like in a movie scene, my body crumbled to the ground, and as \nif in a lucid dream, I hovered above: my body was slumped in the \nmiddle of the city's Third Street, smack in the center of the \nhoop-bottomed dress like a bullseye. The sound that escaped my lips \nstill echoes down that empty streetand in my skull.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days and weeks to follow, people expressed their condolences. \nThey placed gentle hands on my forearm and nodded wordlessly or, more \noften, uttered the phrase \"I'm so sorry for your loss.\" Emails filled \nmy inbox, and messages popped up on social media feeds with broken \nhearts and sad face emojis.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese sympathetic offerings were welcome, if painful, reminders that \nI was a mother who'd lost her child. But their kindness marked a \nclear delineation from the last time I'd grieved the loss of this \nsame child: after I'd relinquished my parental rights 23 years \nearlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack then, no one extended a compassionate hand. No one said they \nwere sorry for my loss.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hospital, after the birth of my son, there were no \ncongratulatory balloons or sympathy cards. Family and friends simply \nleft me alone, and even the nurses seemed disinclined to linger. \nThose moments, though, alone with my newborn son, remain some of the \nmost bittersweet of my life. Days spent recovering from a cesarean \nsection provided time for me to hold and kiss and sing to my baby boy \nwhile explaining to himand trying to convince myselfwhy another \nfamily would be better than I.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter I was discharged, at my mother's house, where I'd spent the \nlast few months of pregnancy, there was no mention of a missing baby. \nEveryday activities returned to normal. I don't blame my family for \nnot acknowledging my child's absence; how could they when I couldn't \nadmit it?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one had given me the tools to process the grief of his absence, \nthe overwhelming ache in my chest, or the empty feeling in my arms. \nInstead, I took the blue baby blanket I'd stolen from the hospital, \nbunched it under my swollen face, and cried in my room with the door \nclosed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I didn't cry for long. Since, technically, the adoption was my \n\"choice,\" I didn't feel I could grieve.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was twenty years old, poor, uneducated, and single, not the \nqualities of a \"good mother,\" which I'd been carefully counseled to \nacknowledge. So, like many other birth mothers, I dissociated from \nthe trauma of relinquishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the beginning of my \"decision-making counseling,\" the crisis \npregnancy worker/adoption advocate, part of a religious organization, \nhad used very specific terminology. First, she used the term \"birth \nmother\" even before the delivery of my son rather than \"expectant \nmother,\" which is both demeaningrelegating me to a baby \nincubatorand coercive in that it creates the expectation that I \nwould be giving up my baby. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen, she used words like \"brave\" and \"selfless\" to describe \nadoption, conveniently or purposefullynot mentioning the trauma \nassociated with relinquishment, and she insisted that I wouldn't be \n\"giving away my baby,\" I would \"place\" him.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking back, I see this as gaslighting and understand better the \nways it serves to devalue or disenfranchise the grief of \nrelinquishment. And the ambiguous nature of the lossthe fact that my \nson was alive but not present contributed to the tendency to brush \nit under the rug. And in my case, my silence and shame were \nheightened by disparaging comments from acquaintances such as \"I \ncould never do such a thing\" or \"How much did you sell your baby for?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, when my son died at twenty-three, everything was \ndifferent. We'd only been reunited for five years and had met \nface-to-face just once, but people automatically offered condolences, \nno questions asked. There was a funeral, a ritual, to mark the \npassage of his life and to honor the grief of his loved ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief that we shared as a group.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt my son's funeral, I was granted the honor of sitting alongside his \nadoptive family, for which I will always be grateful. Since his \npassing, they have shared memories, stories, and anecdotes about our \nson. I cherish our time together. But as I healed, I discovered that \nI couldn't process my grief in the same way as his family because the \nmemories weren't mine. As an example, the first Christmas after my \nson's death, I struggled to find ways to acknowledge the loss and \nprocess my sorrow. Grief experts I spoke with recommended setting his \nplace at the table and cooking his favorite food, but my son had \nnever sat at my table, and I didn't even know what he liked to eat.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis brought me to the big question I'd been struggling to \narticulate: How could I honor and grieve for someone I didn't even \nknow?\u0014\n\u0014\nI began to admit I'd placed him for adoption as an infant and note \nthat we were navigating the rollercoaster of reunion. After he died, \nI discovered there was less stigma to having a dead child versus a \nrelinquished one, so I said, \"Yes, but he's passed away,\" which you \nwould think is safe, but I soon discovered it's not.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou see, that question, if engaged, inevitably turns to something \nalong the lines of \"what was he like?\" And my truthful answer is, \"I \ndon't know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the intensity of the pain fades over time, grief experts recommend \nparents say their child's name. And many parents, at least those \nwho've done their grief work, want to because doing so triggers happy \nmemories. But I don't have those, and I desperately wish I did.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I hear people tell first parents, \"You should be happy your \nchild is with a good family\" or \"You should just move on, you can \nhave other children,\" I can't help but see the pain this inflicts \ndespite any good intentions.\u0014\n\u0014\nI want people to realize that the grief of child relinquishment \ndeserves recognition. And that familial and societal acknowledgment \ncould be pivotal to kick-starting the healing process; I know it was \nfor me.\u0014\n\u0014\nI, therefore, challenge people: if you know someone who has \nrelinquished a child, maybe next time say, \"I'm sorry for your loss,\" \nbecause even if that parent willingly surrendered their parental \nrights, they have still lost a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is grief, and it is mostly unrecognized, but it doesn't need to be.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCandace Cahill is a writer, silversmith and musician.

    "words": "I dont Understand   Tony Cartledge\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the October 7, 2023 attack of Hamas militants in southern \nIsrael and Israels subsequent response of pounding Gaza with tons of \nbombs, I have often overheard relatives and others make the \nstatement: I dont understand how anyone can be pro-Palestinian. \u0014\nThe statement was never made directly to me, perhaps for fear that I \nwould disturb their comfort level by explaining it to them. I have \nvisited Israel and the West Bank more than a dozen times, leading \ntours or participating in archaeological digs. I have Israeli friends \nas well as Palestinian friends. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany Americans have a skewed view of the current situation, primarily \ndue to their misunderstandings of the relationship between biblical \nIsrael and the modern State of Israel. The following are a series of \ntalking points that might be helpful in our understanding of the \nconflict between the current Israeli government and the Palestinian \nresidents of Gaza and the West Bank. \u0014\nJews and Palestinians have common roots. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, it is important to understand terms properly. Biblical Israel, \nas described by authors of the Hebrew Bible, refers primarily to \ndescendants of Abraham who were believed to be inheritors of a \npromise that God would grant Abraham a multitude of descendants and a \nland on which they could live (Genesis 12:1-3). \u0014\n\u0014\nHebrew tradition found in the Table of the Nations of Genesis 10 \nnames all the various peoples, including different Canaanite groups, \nas common descendants of Noah (Gen. 10:15-18). \u0014\n\u0014\nNot all Israelites were Abrahamic descendants: over the years, many \nother people married into Israelite families or chose to make common \ncause and become Hebrews through circumcising their males. Before the \nexile, Hebrews could also marry into different people groups without \nlosing their Hebrew identity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was never a time when the people of biblical Israel did not \nshare the land with other peoples. Hyperbolic language in Joshua \nclaims they conquered the whole land and killed all its residents \n(Josh. 10:40- 43, ll:16-20, 21:43-45), while more realistic language \nlists the many people groups they were unable to drive out (13:13; \n15:63; 16:10; 17:11-13, 16-18; Judges 1:21, 27- 36). Writing just \nbefore or during the exile, the authors often noted that other \npeoples lived among the Israelites to this day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe constant temptation to worship the gods of other people, which \nwas a key message the prophets continually admonished against, \nattests to the continual presence of other peoples in the land. The \nCanaanites (a term used by the Hebrews but not by the people \nthemselves) were an amalgam of many different groups: Amorites, \nHittites, Hivites, Girgashites, Jebusites, and so forth. Many of \ntheir descendants have lived in the land ever since. \u0014\n\u0014\nMultiple scientific studies have shown that even today, for most \nJews, their closest genetic relatives are, notably, Palestinians. \u0014\nBiblical Israel and the modern state of Israel are not the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough much of its biblical history, based on texts in Exodus and \nDeuteronomy, the people of Israel believed they lived in a covenantal \nrelationship in which God promised prosperity as a response to their \nobedience and punishment when they were unfaithful. The receipt of \nthese promises was clearly conditional. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe authors of Israels theological history from Joshua through Kings \nand its most prominent prophets believed that the peoples \nunfaithfulness to the covenant God Yahweh led to a loss of the land. \nThe Assyrians wiped out the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE. \nMany of its people were deported, and others were brought in to \nreplace them. The southern kingdom of Judah fell to the Babylonians \nin 597 BCE. Waves of exiles were moved to Babylon in the years after, \nwith only the poorest being left to farm the land. \u0014\nAfter the land was lost, prophets often proclaimed the hope of a \nreturn to Jerusalem, with people from all over the world looking to a \nrestored and newly righteous Israel for leadership. For the most \npart, these hopes anticipated a new world age for all people, not \njust the possession of a specific piece of geography by Israel alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nExcept for Hasmonean rule from 140 to 37 BCE, the area known as \nCanaan or Palestine has been ruled by others: first Assyrians, \nBabylonians and Persians; then Greeks, Romans and Byzantine \nChristians. From the mid-seventh century until World War I, a series \nof Islamic dynasties, including the Mamluks and Ottomans, ruled the \nland, with brief interruptions by European Crusaders. The Al Aqsa \nMosque and Dome of the Rock have stood on the temple mount for more \nthan 1200 years  more than twice as long as any Jewish temple. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Turks, the League of \nNations assigned control of Palestine and its primarily Arab \npopulation to Britain under what was known as the British Mandate. \nJewish immigration to the land, which had begun in the late 19th \ncentury, increased by largely peaceful means through the purchase of \nland. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1948, with Western nations fueled by guilt over the Holocaust, the \nBritish government persuaded the United Nations to partition the \nland, setting aside a large portion for the Palestinians and \ndesignating the remainder to create a Jewish homeland, even though \nthe land was already populated by people who had lived there for \nhundreds or thousands of years. With conflict inevitable, many Arabs \nwho could afford to relocate, including many Arab Christians, left \nthe country. \u0014\n\u0014\nZionist leaders in Israel declared independence in 1948, leading to a \ncivil war between Jews and Arabs. The partitioning of the land, along \nwith the War of Independence, drove more than 700,000 Palestinians \nfrom their homes. Today, more than 1.5 million Palestinians continue \nto live in 58 official UN-supported refugee camps in the West Bank, \nGaza, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The majority of residents in Gaza \nare refugees.\u0014\n\u0014\n The original partition established a substantial portion of Gaza and \nthe West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as a homeland for \nPalestinians, while apportioning the remainder of the land to Jews. \nBut the agreement was never fully honored. Following the War of \nIndependence in 1948, Israelis seized considerably more of the land \napportioned to Palestine. In the Six-Day War of 1967 and later \naccords, the State of Israel gained control of significantly more \nland in the occupied territories, creating more refugees. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the years since, in violation of international law, Israeli \nsettlers, many emigrating from America, have continued to establish \nnew settlements, towns and even major cities inside the West Bank. \nWhen settlements are established, the Israeli government takes over \nmore Palestinian land to provide roads, infrastructure and security \nfor the settlements, forcing even more Palestinians from their land \nand creating a territory that looks like Swiss cheese. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, only 11% of the West Bank, known as Area A, is under complete \nPalestinian control. It consists of non contiguous enclaves, all of \nwhich are still subject to regular incursions by the Israeli army. \nPalestinians, even within the West Bank, are tightly restricted in \ntheir movement by Israeli walls, fences and checkpoints.\u0014\n\u0014\n Israelite refers to descendants of Abraham through the Twelve \nTribes descended from Jacob, along with others who married into the \npeople or made common cause with them. They were also known as \nHebrews during the biblical period. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the very late postexilic period and into the first century CE, \nrabbinic Judaism emerged, gradually morphing into modern Judaism. \nModern Jews retain an intimate connection with the heritage, promises \nand some traditions portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, though current \npractices are far removed from them. From the time of the post-exilic \nperiod on, maintaining a clear ethnic identity as Jews became a \nprimary focus, and it has helped the Jews survive through centuries \nof pogroms and persecution. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsraeli refers to citizens of the modern State of Israel. Among the \nnearly ten million Israelis, just over seven million are Jews and \nmore than two million are Arabs. Most Arabs in Israel follow the \nIslamic faith, while some are Druze and a few are Christian. Other \nminorities make up 5.5% of the population. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong Jewish Israelis, nearly half self-identify as secular and a \nthird as traditional. The areas around Jerusalem and the \nsettlements are dominated by various strands of Orthodox and Ultra \nOrthodox Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Israelis, especially in the large population center of Tel \nAviv-Jaffo, do not support the current right-wing government. West \nBank access restrictions map by United Nations. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe countrys dysfunctional political system makes it difficult for \nmore moderate voices to gain control from hardliners of the far right \nand their Orthodox supporters, who receive funding from the \ngovernment for the men to study Torah without being required to work \nor serve in the military. \u0014\nExcept for a few ex-pats and foreign church officials who control \nvarious Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, virtually all \nChristians remaining in Israel and the West Bank are Arabs. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome deeply rooted beliefs are misguided. \u0014\n\u0014\nA belief known as American exceptionalism, closely related to \nChristian nationalism (and to white supremacy), holds that God has a \nspecial covenant with America. Adherents of American exceptionalism \nbelieve that just as Israel left slavery in Egypt to reach the \npromised land, early settlers also left persecution in England to \npossess a new land of promise with Gods blessing to displace the \nindigenous peoples who were already there. \u0014\n\u0014\nModern devotees of this idea believe that Americas prosperity is \ntied to its unwavering support for Israel. The belief is often \nconnected to a literal interpretation of Genesis 12:3, where God \nreportedly promised Abraham, I will bless those who bless you, and \nthose who curse you I will curse. \u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving that the promise of Gen. 12:3 remains in effect  and that \nthe modern State of Israel is equivalent to the people and land \npromised to Abraham  prominent televangelists like Jerry Falwell, \nPat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggert, John Hagee, along with a host of \nconservative pastors, have long promoted the belief that America must \nalways support the modern nation-state of Israel in order to receive \nGods blessings. \u0014\n\u0014\nComing at the issue from a slightly different angle, many other \nChristians hold to an apocalyptic, dispensationalist view of history. \nThey are not troubled by war in the Middle East (or other \nearth-destroying phenomena such as climate change) because they \nbelieve the end times are coming soon. Multiple YouTube videos by \nself-proclaimed experts on prophecy connect Israels war in Gaza to \ntheir interpretation of biblical end times prophecies. They support \nIsrael, but only as an end to bringing on Armageddon  a different \ntype of anti-Semitism. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can we do? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Hebrew Bible attests that ancient Israel violated the \ncovenant and thus lost the land, that does not mean the covenant was \nwholly annulled or that God no longer has a special relationship with \nthe descendants of Israel. We can argue that the promise of land as \nan eternal possession no longer holds without adopting a wholly \nsupersessionist view that God has written off the Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe should recognize that the Jews have suffered greatly through the \nyears and understand why having a homeland is important to them. We \nalso can support the people of Israel without supporting the actions \nof the current government, including the massive bombing of Gaza and \nthe continued inhumane treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank. \nIsrael currently holds about 4,500 Palestinians in prison, many \nwithout recourse to legal defense or a trial  and many of them women \nand children. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe can recognize that Palestinian, Hamas and terrorist are not \nequivalent terms. Most Palestinians want to live in peace without \nfurther loss of land and rights. All Palestinians have abundant \nreasons to be highly resentful over both past and present oppression. \nIf we were in their shoes, we would be angry, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe must acknowledge that the October 7, 2023 massacre of 1,200 \nIsraeli citizens, visitors and workers  along with the abduction of \nmore than 200 hostages  by Hamas militants was horrific and \ninexcusable. Random missile fire into Israel is also unacceptable. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe must also question whether those actions justify the \nindiscriminate weeks of bombing that leveled much of Gaza, and which \nthe UN believes killed more than 20,000 residents, including as many \nas 14,000 women and children between October and December 2023  and \nthe subjection of many thousands of residents of Gaza to starvation, \nthirst and disease through withholding aid and fuel. Some estimate \nthat famine and disease may kill more than the bombs. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne can be pro-Israel without endorsing the current governments \naggressive military actions. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne can be pro-Palestinian without endorsing acts of violence on the \npart of a few militants. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of us can focus more on being pro-humanity, earnestly praying for \nand promoting approaches that foster peace and justice for all. \u0014\nMore personally, we can seek to follow Jesus in loving our neighbors, \nengaging in conversation and acts of friendship with Jewish and \nMuslim people who live or work near us. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut will we?\u0014",

    "title": "INTERPRETATIONS OF GOOD FRIDAY",
    "words": "There were three early interpretations of Good Friday: the Hebrew, \nthe Greek, and the Roman.\u0014\n\u0014\nHebrew: The earliest Christians were Jews, of course, so they saw \nGood Friday as a sacrifice. Jews went to the temple on the high holy \ndays and made a sacrifice to God, preferably an unblemished lamb. So \nJesus, who was crucified on the Temple mount during the holy days, \nbecame the lamb of God, and we are saved by the blood of the \nlamb. A life, a sacrifice had to be given to satisfy the Almighty, \nand even though He was the one doing it, in Christ, there was no \nsalvationgetting right with Godwithout a sacrifice.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreek: The Greek influence was both philosophical and artistic. \nPhilosophy gave us Gnosticism, the idea that Good Friday is \nunderstood only by the intuition of the elite, who know things that \nnobody else does. [gnosis in Greek is knowledge] The Greek [and \nRoman] plays gave us the Trinity. In those plays, actors played many \nroles by coming on stage wearing different masks. The masks were \ncalled personae. In the Trinity, God is an actor who wears three \ndifferent masks, three personae. Thats how God manages to sacrifice \nto Himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Romans were legalists. They were as fixated on Law as the \nHebrews, but theirs was secular. Nonetheless, this gave us the \nsubstitutionary atonement theory. The legal case: People, in Adam, \nsinned against God, by trying to take the place of God, and the \nrighteousness of God requires that someone must be punished, just as \nsomeone had to be punished if you committed a crime against the Roman \nEmpire. God, in the person of Christ, takes the necessary punishment, \nsubstituting himself for us.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese days, its hard to believe in salvation through esoteric \nknowledge shared by only a few, or that God has to be placated \nthrough blood sacrifice, or that every misdemeanor requires capital \npunishment. Where does that leave us?\u0014\n\u0014\nJOHN ROBERT MCFARLAND\u0014",

    "title": "IVAN THE TERRRIBLE MURDERED PHILIP OF MOSCOW",
    "words": "Ivan the Terrible Murdered Philip of Moscow\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |   APR 03, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nCsar Ivan IV of Russia was so noted for his cruelty he became known \nas \"Ivan the Terrible.\" Among the many monstrous actions of this \nsixteenth-century monarch was the murder of Philip of Moscow.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Philip of Moscow?\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip was born into a good Russian family in 1510 and named Fyodor \nKolychev. The Kolychevs were active in government service, and Fyodor \nspent his youth at the court of the czar. One day while at church, \nFyodor was convicted by Christ's warning that a man cannot serve two \nmasters. Fearing that the court was keeping him from Christ, Fyodor \nfled the Russian capital and went north to the Solovetsky Monastery, \njust within the Arctic Circle on an island in the White Sea. It was a \nprimitive place compared to the glitter of the capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoing God's Work\u0014\n\u0014\nThe monks accepted Fyodor and gave him the name Philip. He won a \nreputation for piety, intelligence, and a sense of duty in following \nmonastic rules. In 1547, the same year that Ivan the Terrible was \ncrowned czar, Philip became abbot of the monastery. Demonstrating \nexceptional administrative abilities, he transformed the monastery \ninto one of the great industrial complexes of the empire. Under \nPhilip's administration, the monks cleared fields for cultivation; \nestablished a dairy farm, a mill, and a workshop for leather and fur \nclothes; built storage bins for the monastery's grain; developed a \nsystem of dams, reservoirs and canals to drain the swampland and \nbring water to the monastery; built a hospital for pilgrims; and new \ndormitories. In addition to all this, they erected a new cathedral. \nThey consecrated all of their agricultural and industrial labor to \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Promoted to Metropolitan\u0014\nPhilip of Moscow confronts Ivan the Terrible\u0014\n\u0014\nThe czar was so impressed with these accomplishments that he \nappointed Philip to be metropolitan--head of the Russian church. \nPhilip, however, was not a yes-man. On religious grounds, he opposed \nmany of Ivan's policies and his mass executions. Ivan tried to \nintimidate him, but Philip asked himself, \"Where is my faith if I am \nsilent?\" He continued to speak against the czar. Once he warned the \nczar, \"Your earthly rank has no control over death, which sinks its \ninvincible teeth into everything. And remember that each person must \nanswer for his own life.\" Ivan would try to reform but then lapse \nback into brutality.\u0014\n\u0014\nCzar's Intimidation\u0014\nAt last, he beheaded Philip's cousin and sent the head to Philip sewn \nup in a leather bag. The next day, the czar sent one of his brutal \nunderlings to arrest Philip in the middle of service.

    "words": "Ivan the Terrible Murdered Faithful Philip of Moscow\u0014\n\u0014\nIVAN THE TERRIBLE, Czar of Russia, was a brutal man. He killed many \nnoblemen and slaughtered hundreds of people in cities that resisted \nhim, torturing many of them first. After he had grown bold enough, he \neven murdered Philip of Moscow, Russias highest churchman. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a youth, Philip was invited to court by Czar Vassily III because \nhe was the son of one of Russias noblest families. Stories differ as \nto why he left. One story says while attending church, he heard \nChrists warning that no man can serve two masters. Recognizing that \nthe glitter of the court was stifling his soul, he fled to Solovetsky \nMonastery. Another story says he was involved in a political plot and \nfled for his life. Either way, he became a monk in the abbey, which \nstood on an island in the White Sea, so far north that it lay within \nthe Arctic Circle. \u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip developed such a reputation for piety and intelligence that he \nwas made abbot of the monastery in 1547. Coincidentally, this was the \nsame year that Ivan the Terrible was crowned czar. Their lives would \nsoon intersect in more significant ways. \u0014\n\u0014\nDemonstrating exceptional administrative abilities and a willingness \nto work side by side with the other monks at canal building and other \nhard projects, Philip transformed the monastery into a booming \nindustrial center. He and his men operated a brick kiln, erected a \ncathedral, constructed water mills and storehouses, drained swamps, \ndammed waters, and linked nearby lakes with canals. They also \nestablished a workshop for leather and fur clothes, built a hospital \nfor pilgrims, and opened new dormitories. Most importantly, the area \nexperienced a spiritual revival. \u0014\n\u0014\nHearing of Philips accomplishments, Ivan asked him to become \nmetropolitan of Moscowhead of the Russian church. Philip agreed on \nthe condition that Ivan abolish his notorious and cruel secret \npolicethe Oprichnina. Ivan agreed initially, but instead later \nintensified the terror. Philip spoke out. When Ivan tried to \nintimidate him, the Metropolitan asked himself, Where is my faith if \nI am silent? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe showdown came in 1568 when Ivan was preparing to terrorize \nNovgorod. He demanded Philips blessing as the primate was saying \nmass. Philip refused. Fear the judgment of God, to whom we are here \nmaking a pure sacrifice. Rebuking the Czar for his injustice and \nlack of compassion, he reminded him of the Judge on high. How shall \nyou present yourself before that tribunal? Dare you appear there \ncovered with the blood of innocents, deaf to their cries of pain? \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon afterward Ivan rigged an incident to make it seem that Philip \nhad brought a false accusation against one of the czars cronies. \nCowed by the czar, churchmen deposed Philip. Ivan imprisoned him in a \nlocal monastery but soon moved him far from Moscow to keep the common \nfolk from gathering around his place of imprisonment. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 23 December 1569, one of Ivans henchmen, Skuratov, rode \nto the monastery where Philip was held. Most accounts say Skuratov \nstrangled him there, but one says that he took Philip to Alexandrov \nwhere he was burned to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

HOWARD LEWINE\u0014\n          Harvard Health Publishing\u0014\n\u0014\nAt best, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is inconvenient, forcing \npeople to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At \nworst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and \ncontrolling people's ability to work and travel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                      \nPossible factors\u0014\n\u0014\nIBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, because it aff \nects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent \nstructural problem. The cause of IBS remains frustratingly unclear, \nbut symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of \nfactors. Among them:\u0014\n\u0014\nChanges in the gut microbiome: This array of microbes in the gut is \ninfl uenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. About 10% \nof people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, \nbacterial or parasitic  even COVID-19  show a higher rate of IBS.\u0014\n\u0014\nSkewed intestinal muscle contractions: Normally rhythmic, these \ncontractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower \nthan normal in IBS patients.\u0014\n\u0014\nFaulty nerve signals: Normal digestion relies on clear communication \nbetween the brain, gut and nervous system. These signals are \ndisrupted in IBS.\u0014\n\u0014\nPelvic fl oor problems: This is especially true for women whose \npelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic \nconstipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly life stress: This can include traumatic events during \nchildhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenetics: People with a family history of IBS are more likely to \nhave it, as well.\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                       \nManaging symptoms\u0014\n\u0014\nIBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms \ndominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C) or a combination.\u0014\n\u0014\nIBS management starts with diet and lifestyle changes. For many \npeople, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of \nfl uids, exercising regularly and getting sufficient sleep can help \ncontrol mild symptoms.\u0014\n\u0014\nSymptoms also might worsen depending on the foods you eat.\u0014\nWheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage and carbonated \ndrinks are known culprits.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Howard LeWine is an internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in \nBoston and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

    "words": "Miss America 2003, Erica Harold, wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Frost wrote in his poem The Road Less Traveled, \"Two roads \ndiverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that \nhas made all the difference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose lines capture the essence of why I chose to adopt \"Teenage \nSexual Abstinence: Respect Yourself, Protect Yourself\" as my platform.\u0014\n\u0014\nEver since I can remember, I've had a commitment to abstinence. I was \nfortunate to have been raised by two loving parents who encouraged me \nto set high standards, to value myself, and to save myself for \nmarriage. But I grew up knowing that I was lucky and that not every \nyoung person had the love and support I did. I saw many of my peers \nuse sex to try to find that love and acceptance. But instead of being \nable to fill that void, many of them became teen parents, contracted \ndiseases, and had their hearts broken. \u0014\n\u0014\nI used to feel badly for them and wish they had realized that being \nabstinent could have spared them from those consequences. However, I \ncame to recognize that it was not enough to feel bad; I knew I had to \ntake action. As Gandhi once said, \"You must become the change you \nwish to see in the world.\" So when the time came to select a platform \nfor the Miss Illinois pageant, my conscience compelled me to choose \nabstinence. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow I must admit I was initially very nervous about making abstinence \npresentations. Many people warned me that the students might become \nhostile and throw their pens and books at me. I also had nightmares \nof being booed out of classrooms. But I am pleased to report to you \nthat none of those things happened, and I emerged from every \nclassroom in one piece.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was invited to speak to young women at a correctional facility. \nWhen I told friends and family members that this invitation had been \nextended, many told me to decline. They said the young people in this \nfacility were too far gone to be receptive to the abstinence message. \nHowever, I have always believed it is arrogant to think you can \ndetermine which young people will and will not respond to this \nmessage. Furthermore, it's dangerous to decide that some people are \ndeserving of this message of empowerment, while others should be \ndeprived. Therefore, I accepted the invitation. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did the young people at the correctional facility listen to \nthis message, but many of them thanked me for coming. They said they \nknew they had made some poor choices in the past and appreciated \nhearing how they could make better choices in the future. One young \nwoman even spoke of her desire to speak about abstinence to other \nyoung people.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking about the benefits of abstinence has truly been one of the \nmost extraordinary experiences of my life. When I began, I was a \nnervous 18-year-old, simply attempting not to embarrass myself. But \nas I did each presentation, I gained confidence, not only in myself, \nbut also in the idea that people my age truly can make a difference. \nTherefore, when I speak to young people, I encourage them to stand \nfirmly in defense of their principles. As Gandhi once said, \"To \nbelieve in something and not live it is to be dishonest.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough being an advocate for abstinence may seem to have been the \nroad less traveled, I'd like to tell you that, as Robert Frost said, \nit has, indeed, made all the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\n From Statement to Congress by Erika N.

    "words": "Is The \nPassion Biblical or Extra-Biblical?\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham\u0014\n02-25-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nChristians will likely ignore the most biblically sound theme in Mel \nGibsons movie The Passion of the Christ, and they will likely \nembrace the most biblically faulty problems of the movie. Both offer \ninsightful congregational leaders a teachable moment.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst is Jesus complete rejection of violence, which Gibson \naccurately captures. Jesus speaks against the use of force at his \narrest. In a flashback to the Sermon on the Mount, he urges his \nfollowers to love their enemies. During his brutal treatment on the \nway to the cross, Jesus refuses to retaliate against his adversaries. \nWith both word and deed, Jesus practices non-violence. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians, especially conservative evangelicals, tend to \noverlook Jesus utter rejection of the use of violence. Instead, they \nwater down what Jesus taught about peacemaking and evade the way he \nshowed us how to live. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf viewers leave the movie theaters talking about Jesus rejection of \nforce, then perhaps some good--albeit unintended--will come to our \nculture of violence from The Passion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore likely than not, however, most Christians will embrace the \nbiblically faulty portions of the movie. They will think that the \nmovies depiction of Jesus arrest and crucifixion corresponds to the \nbiblical witness. \u0014\n\u0014\nContrary to the hype in Christian circles, Gibsons movie is not \nbased on the Bible. Southern Baptist seminary president Al Mohler is \nwrong when he writes, Without doubt, Gibson has based his movie on \nthe New Testament accounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSegments of the movie do reflect fragments of the biblical accounts. \nMost of the movie, however, is based on extra-biblical material. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne example is the ghoulish figure that lurks throughout the movie, \nbut is not found in any of the four Gospel accounts. The hairless \npale figure first appears in the Garden of Gethsemane. From beneath \nthe figures robe, a serpent slithers towards Jesus, who is praying \nface-down on the ground. When Jesus stands, he crushes the head of \nthe serpent with his foot.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe demonic-like figure watches the Roman soldiers sadistically beat \nJesus and walks among the crowd as Jesus carries the cross. At one \npoint, the evil figure and Mary, the mother of Jesus, engage in a \nface-off, a kind of contest of spiritual wills.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother extra-biblical theme is the role of Mary. Contrary to the \nbiblical witness, Mary appears at Jesus trial. She mops up his \nmassive blood loss at his beating by the Romans. She follows him to \nCalvary. Twice, when Jesus can no longer carry the cross, Jesus sees \nMary and draws a supernatural strength from her to continue. In the \nfirst scene, a Roman soldier recognizes her uniqueness and wonders \nwho she is.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet another extra-biblical clip shows a woman with a white cloth who \ngently presses it upon Jesus bloody face when he has staggered to \nhis knees. As he struggles on, she is left with a shroud, an imprint \nof his face.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother is the graphic beating of Jesus, which is mentioned only \nbriefly in the Gospel accounts. Matthew and Mark record only these \nwords, having scourged Jesus, Pilate delivered him to be crucified. \nLuke has no Roman beating. John says only that Pilate took Jesus and \nhad him flogged. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Gibsons version of events, however, two Roman soldiers \nsimultaneously beat Jesus with two different types of whips, tearing \nchunks of flesh from his body. The lengthy brutality is so gratuitous \nthat one wonders if Gibson worships an angry God who provides \nsalvation through the baptism of blood, as if Jesus blood has a \nmagical power.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditional material not in the Bible also courses through the movie, \nincluding the demonic children who torment Judas into hanging \nhimself. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile his movie lacks the much-debated, overtly harsh anti-Semitism, \nit does bump the line repeatedly. Blaming the Jews is so embedded in \ncontemporary folk Christianity that the movie may reinforce this \nfalse belief. It may trigger anti-Semitism among those with a \npredisposition toward anti-Semitism. Nevertheless, responsible clergy \nwill condemn anti-Semitism and confess the historical truth that the \nroots of violence against Jews are deep within the Christian church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMake no mistake about the movies chilling and graphic content. Be \nassured that the sub-titles over lines spoken in Latin and Aramaic \nare more tolerable than one would expect. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut aside from its entertainment value, the movie ensures the advance \nof biblical illiteracy for years to come and the encroachment of \nflaky evangelism on those who need an authentic understanding of real \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics. \nHe viewed The Passion of the Christ at a pre-release screening for \njournalists Monday, Feb. 23.\u0014",

    "title": "ISRAEL ON THE APPOMATTOX - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Review by William C. Davis\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a century and a half historians have been retelling the \ncompelling story of Appomattox, of the April day in 1865 when two \ngreat warriors met to make peace. They have painted Robert E. Lee in \nhis finest uniform, Ulysses S. Grant in his grubby field blouse, the \nuncomfortable and slightly embarrassed meeting between the two to \nsurrender Lees army and begin the end of the Civil War. Always a \npart of the story is the coincidence of their meeting in the home of \na man who moved to Appomattox to get away from war after the first \nreal battle broke out across his fields along Bull Run four years \nbefore. As a result, Appomattox is one of the few names on the land \nthat has taken on a separate and higher meaning all its own in our \nlanguage.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet amid all this compelling repetition, a far more ironic and \nfascinating meaning of the word has been overshadowed by what \nhappened on April 9, 1865, for Appomattox itself embodied what \nbrought the sections to war in the first place, and foreshadowed the \nproblems and complications that soon revealed that it was not to end \nso quickly and neatly as two men of good will making peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1796 Richard Randolph, wealthy Virginia planter, decided that he \ncould no longer abide slavery, even though it had made him rich. In \nhis will he begged his slaves for their forgiveness. He freed more \nthan 90 of them and then set aside 400 acres of his own Appomattox \nRiver plantation to be a home for them, a place for them to create a \nfree black community in the heart of slave-holding Virginia. They \ncalled themselves Israelites and named their new community Israel \nHill. Thereafter, the success or failure of their community would \ndepend almost entirely upon their own efforts, yet more than that was \nat stake, for their history would be a validationor refutationof \nthe idea that black men and women could govern themselves and \nfunction responsibly as members of a free society.\u0014\n\u0014\nElys Israel on the Appomattox is the story of their struggle, in a \nhostile environment in which civil law and local custom both strove \nto contain and discourage freedom for blacks. They could not vote, \nhold office, testify in court or serve on a jury, or even own a gun \nwithout permission. Their movements outside their little community \nwere severely proscribed, and the means of supporting themselves were \nlimited by law and convention to rude labor, then turned against them \nas white opponents pointed out that the Israelites did only mindless \nwork like moving boats on the Appomattox River because it came \nnearest to idleness of any endeavor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrilliantly researched, poignantly narrated, and objectively \nassessed, Elys story of Israel Hill and the struggle of its people, \ntheir success and their failure, and their ultimate fate in the wake \nof that other Appomattox, is riveting reading, revealing as it does \nthat, like John Winthrops Massachusetts Bay Colony, Israel Hill was \nitself a different sort of city on a hill, and that many watched \nits changing fortunes, hopeful that it would validate their varying \naspirations and prejudices.

That plushy white bread goes straight to \nyour gut and then hangs out as belly fat, reports The Associated \nPress.

Specifically, they \nexamined five different diets where one type of food was prominent: \nhealthy food, white bread, alcohol, sweets, or meat and potatoes.

At the end of the study, \nthose who indulged in white bread had three times the gain in the gut \nas did their peers who ate whole grains. This is serious stuff. \nPeople who have bigger waists have a higher risk of heart disease \nthan those who weigh the same but don't carry the extra weight around \nthe belly. Why?

    "words": "Imperfect Instrument\u0014\nWorld Vision's founder led a tragic and inspiring life.\u0014\nby Tim Stafford \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Pierce was an extreme version of post-WWII evangelicalism: \nentrepreneurial, energetic, independent, and out to evangelize the \nworld. In 1947, the young Youth for Christ evangelist started toward \nChina with only enough money to buy a ticket to Honolulu. That was \nhow things were done in Youth for Christ: God's work overcame all \nobstacles, and God's workers should \"burn out, not rust out.\" Pierce \neventually made it to China, where thousands came to Christ during \nfour months of evangelistic rallies. Hunger was everywhere; communism \nhammered at the door. A compassionate Pierce was hooked. \"My father \nwent to China a young man in search of adventure,\" his daughter \nMarilee Pierce Dunker would write. \"He came home a man with a \nmission.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPierce later wrote haunting words in the flyleaf of his Bible: \"Let \nmy heart be broken with the things that break the heart of God.\" \nDragging a movie camera across AsiaChina was soon closedPierce \nshowed the resulting pictures to church audiences in North America. \nHe asked for money to help children. He showed their faces and begged \nChristians to \"adopt\" one. In 1950 he incorporated this personal \ncrusade as World Vision.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1959, journalist Richard Gehman wrote that \"[Pierce] cannot \nconceal his true emotions. He seems to me to be one of the few \nnaturally, uncontrollably honest men I have ever met.\" When asked by \nFranklin Graham how to \"shake people out of their complacency,\" \nPierce said he had \"become a part of the suffering. I literally felt \nthe child's blindness, the mother's grief.  It was all too real to \nme when I stood before an audience.  It's not something that can be \nfaked.\" Pastor Richard Halvorsen wrote that Pierce \"prayed more \nearnestly and importunely than anyone else I have ever known. It was \nas though prayer burned within him.  Bob Pierce functioned from a \nbroken heart.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same intensity led to his downfall. He had an ungoverned temper \nand frequently clashed with the World Vision board, particularly over \nhis insistence on making financial commitments on the fly. He \ntraveled as much as 10 months of the year, and his family suffered. \n\"I've made an agreement with God,\" he said, \"that I'll take care of \nhis helpless little lambs overseas if he'll take care of mine at \nhome.\" In 1963 he had a nervous breakdown. For nine months he almost \ndisappeared, preferring to travel the world rather than return home. \nIn 1967 he resigned from World Vision, bitter at those whom he felt \ninterfered with his organization. On a 1968 good-bye tour of Asia, \nhis daughter Sharon reached him by phone. She asked if he could come \nhome, but he refused, saying that he wanted to extend his trip to \nVietnam. His wife, Lorraine, started home immediately, but by the \ntime she arrived, Sharon had tried to commit suicide. Later that \nyear, she tried again and succeeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy then Pierce was hospitalized in Switzerland. He would stay there \nfor a year, treated with insulin and other drugs. The following year, \nhe took over a small hunger organization that became Samaritan's \nPurse. In 1970 he legally separated from his wife. His daughter \nMarilee wrote that his memory was \"badly crippled\" and his mind \n\"frequently unclear.\" Just once, in September 1978, the family was \nable to gather for an evening of reconciliation. Four days later, \nPierce died.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Pierce's work continuesbigger than he could have imaginedin \nWorld Vision and Samaritan's Purse. His passion and compassion still \nset the standard for others who serve the poor. God works with \nimperfect instruments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today.

    "title": "IT IS FINISHED",
    "words": "'It Is Finished' But It Is Not Over\u0014\nGod's work of redemption continues in the redeemed. An excerpt from \nCross-Shattered Christ.\u0014\nby Stanley Hauerwas | posted 03/24/2005\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"It is finished.\"\u0014\n    John 19:30\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is finished\" is not a death gurgle. \"It is finished\" is not \"I am \ndone for.\" \"It is finished\" will not be, as we know from the \ntradition of the ordering of these words from the cross, the last \nwords of Jesus. \"It is finished\" is a cry of victory. \"It is \nfinished\" is the triumphant cry that what I came to do has been done. \nAll is accomplished, completed, fulfilled work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe work that is finished, moreover, is the cross. He will be and is \nresurrected, but the resurrected One remains the One crucified. Rowan \nWilliams reminds us of Pascal's stark remark that \"Jesus will be in \nagony until the end of the world.\" This is a remark that makes \nunavoidable the recognition that we live in the time between the \ntimesthe kingdom is begun in Christ but will not be consummated or \nperfected until the end of the world. Williams observes that Pascal's \ncomment on Jesus' ongoing agony is not an observation about the \ndeplorable state of unbelievers; it is instead an exhortation to us, \nthose who believe in Christ. It is an exhortation not to become \nnostalgic for a supposedly less compromised past or take refuge in \nsome imagined purified future, but to dwell in the tension-filled \ntime between times, to remain awake to our inability \"to stay in the \nalmost unbearable present moment where Jesus is.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel of John makes explicit what all the Gospels assumethat \nis, the cross is not a defeat but the victory of our God. Earlier in \nthe Gospel of John a voice from heaven responded to Jesus' request \nthat the Father's name might be glorified through his obedience, \nsaying, \"I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.\" Jesus \ntells us this voice came for our sake so that we might know that \"Now \nis the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be \ndriven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all \npeople to myself\" (John 12:28-32). That \"lifting up\" is the cross, \nthe exaltation of the Son by the Father, making possible our \nsalvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is, moreover, as Pilate insisted, the King of the Jews. That \nkingship is not delayed by crucifixion; rather, crucifixion is the \nway this king rules. Crucifixion is kingdom come. This is the great \nlong-awaited apocalyptic moment. Here the powers of this world are \nforever subverted. Time is now redeemed through the raising up of \nJesus on this cross. A new age has begun. The kingdom is here aborn, \na new regime is inaugurated, creating a new way of life for those who \nworship and follow Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCreation rightly describes the work done here. In his book Believing \nThree Ways in the One God, Nicholas Lash calls attention to a remark \nin a fifth-century calendar on March 25, a day identified as the \nmartyrology of Jerome, which says, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ was \ncrucified, and conceived, and the world was made.\" Lash observes on \nthis day, the day of crucifixion, God brings all things alive, \ncreating ex nihilo making a home in our sin-scarred world. \"Out of \nthe virgin's womb, Christ is conceived. Out of that world-threatening \ndeath on Calvary, life is new-born from an empty tomb. Christ's \nterror is God's Word's human vulnerability. But, it is just this \nvulnerability, this surrender, absolute relationship, which draws out \nof darkness finished life, forgiveness of sins.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the sixth day of creation \"God saw everything that he had made, \nand indeed, it was very good\" (Genesis 1:31). So on the seventh day \n\"God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh \nday from all the work that he had done\" (Genesis 2:2). Accordingly \nthe seventh day was hallowed. But God's work, the work of the \nTrinity, is consummated in Jesus' great declaration from the cross, \n\"It is finished.\" His life, his death, his resurrection, as Irenaeus \ninsisted, recapitulates creation, recapitulates God's covenant with \nIsrael, uniting creation and redemption in Incarnation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the beginning of the Gospel of John we are told:\u0014\n\u0014\n    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the \nWord was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into \nbeing through him, and without him not one thing came into being. \nWhat has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light \nof all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did \nnot overcome it. (John 1:15)\u0014\n\u0014\nCreation has an end, creation is to be consummated, and the name of \nthat end and consummation is Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nSin does not and cannot determine the character of Jesus' task. To be \nsure, he has come that we might be redeemed, but our redemption is \nbut one movement in this drama of the beginning and end of time. In \nhis book After the Spirit, Gene Rogers suggests that we let \n\"redemption\" name a plot defined by a starting point. We begin in \nslavery from which we are redeemed. The plot of consummation, \nhowever, is not determined by a starting point but by an endpoint: \n\"it ends in joy, in that to whom one is united.\" Consummation is joy \nmade possible by God's love, by God's friendship with us. In Jesus, \nredemption and consummation become movements in the one story of \nGod's unrelenting love for his creation. That wethat is, we \nGentilesare included in the redemption of Israel is but a sign of \nthe abundance of God's love and the completion of the new creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is why \"it is finished\" is such good news. For Irenaeus, Jesus \nis the one who recapitulates all that God has done on our behalf \nuntil the final consummation. But this means that in Christ that \nrecapitulation continues in the world. We, the body of Christ, \nthrough the Spirit, turn out to be \"the finished.\" This, I believe, \nis what Athanasius meant by his dictum that God became human so that \nhumans might become divine. Which means, as Richard Neuhaus puts it \nin his reflections on the seven words in his Death on a Friday \nAfternoon: \"'It is finished.' But it is not over.\" God remains at \nwork making us, his creatures, divine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is over is our vain attempts to be our own creators. What has \nhappened is our overwhelming, says David Ford. We are overwhelmed by \nGod's love through which we are able to see the beauty of God's care \nfor all that is. Now it is possible for us to live at peace, to be \nGod's agent of reconciliation, in a violent world. We are able so to \nlive not because we have answers to all the world's troubles, but \nbecause God has given us a way to live without answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo so live does not mean we will be free of suffering, but it means \nthat we can now live knowing it is through suffering that God's \nkingdom is manifest. Paul writes to the Colossians,\u0014\n\u0014\n    I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my \nflesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the \nsake of the body, that is, the church. I became its servant according \nto God's commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of \nGod fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages \nand generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God \nchose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of \nthe glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. \n(Colossians 1:24-27)\u0014\n\u0014\nGod has finished what only God could finish. Christ's sacrifice is a \ngift that exceeds every debt. Our sins have been consumed, making \npossible lives that glow with the beauty of God's Spirit. What \nwonderful news: \"'It is finished.' But it is not over.\" It is not \nover because God made us, the church, the \"not over.\" We are made \nwitnesses so the worlda world with no time for a crucified Godmay \nknow we have all the time of God's kingdom to live in peace with one \nanother.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsed by permission of Brazos, a division of Baker Publishing Group, \ncopyright 2005.

This command is part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount; it is \nJesus' most popular saying because our culture values tolerance so \nhighly.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is usually ripped out of context and misinterpreted.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew 7:1-5 includes Jesus' warning about trying to take a speck \nout of a neighbor's eye while ignoring the log in your own eye. In \nverse five, Jesus makes clear the audience he is addressing: \"You \nhypocrite!\" When Jesus says \"Do not judge,\" he is warning people \nagainst heaping criticism and condemnation on others without being \nwilling to examine one's own behavior. Clearly the context is one in \nwhich some religious leaders were harshly condemning other people \nwhile attempting to justify their own sinfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, many people are unaware of balancing texts about judging \nin the rest of the New Testament. These include Jesus' command \"Do \nnot judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment\" (John 7:24, \nNRSV), and Paul's rhetorical question \"Is it not those who are inside \n[the church] that you are to judge?\" (1 Cor. 5:12). Clearly not all \njudging is forbidden. If that were the case, the church could have no \nboundaries; the body of Christ would not be a body but a gaseous \nvapor!\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul urged the Corinthian church to exclude the man who was living \nwith his father's wife; he ordered them not to associate with people \nwho claim to be Christians but live blatantly sinful lives without \nrepentance (1 Cor. 5). Did Paul simply forget Jesus' command not to \njudge? Was he unaware of it? That's doubtful. Rather, we should \nsuppose that Jesus meant only to condemn hypocritical judging. When \nthe church must discipline a member, it should always do so in full \nrecognition of everyone's lack of perfection and need of the Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome churches and Christian organizations avoid church discipline \nbecause it is a form of judging, and judging is wrongly equated with \nintolerance. Judging is then (ironically) judged incompatible with \nthe spirit of Jesus' teaching. Church discipline is surely the more \nbiblical approach, even as it is fraught with danger.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament condemns every spirit that says Jesus Christ has \nnot come in the flesh (1 John 4). Today the problem is more likely to \narise around denials of Christ's deity. And yet Christ's deity is a \nnonnegotiable of Christian faith that is crucial to the gospel. \nChristians should not tolerate denials of such central truths within \nthe church, and must discipline with love those who knowingly reject \nthe truth of the Incarnation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, the New Testament condemns immorality, including \nhomosexual behavior (Rom. 1:26-27). Churches that condone such \nbehavior among believers are abdicating their responsibility to \nshepherd God's flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch discipline inexorably involves making judgments and even \njudging people's behaviors, but it can be done in a nonjudgmental and \nhumble manner. One church I know stripped a man of membership, \nwithout shaming or humiliating him, because he refused to cease an \nadulterous relationship or repent of it. He was encouraged to \ncontinue attending worship services, and his involvement in the \nchurch eventually contributed to his repentance and restoration to \nfull fellowship. The church acknowledged that everyone sins, but \nrecognized the importance of a repentant spirit. Without such humble \ndiscipline, there is no real discipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, even though the context of Matthew 7 may not require it, one \nis justified in thinking that Jesus does not want us to take God's \nplace in determining individual persons' ultimate spiritual fate. \nThis would be another example of inappropriate judging. Which \nspecific individuals of our acquaintance will end up in heaven and \nwhich will end up in hell is not for us to determine. That judgment \nbelongs to God alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut who should be a member of a church, and how members should behave \nas such, must sometimes be decided by the church, based on beliefs \nand behaviors.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger E.

Truett \nTheological Seminary of Baylor University, and author of The \nWestminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology.\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today.

    "title": "IT'S ALL ABOUT JESUS -- A CONVERT TO OTHODOXY",
    "words": "It's All About Jesus\u0014\nA convert to Orthodoxy reconsiders evangelicalism.\u0014\nby Sam Torode | posted 08/12/2005 09:00 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty years ago, Thomas Howard, the brother of devotional writer \nElisabeth Elliot, wrote a book titled Evangelical Is Not Enough. His \nbasic argument was that rituals don't necessarily lead to dead \nreligiosity. Instead, sacramental rites and liturgical rhythms can \nbring us closer to Christ. Howard was an Anglican at the time, and \nlater became Roman Catholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been on a similar journey. I grew up Baptist, lost my \nfundamentalist faith, became interested in the ancient traditions of \nthe church, attended a Lutheran parish for a time, and eventually \nwound up Eastern Orthodox.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Howard, I now stand on the opposite side of the liturgical fence \nfrom most evangelicals. But I've come to a different conclusion than \n\"evangelical is not enough.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical Principles\u0014\nWhat is evangelicalism, anyhow? Evangelical seems to be an adjective \nmore than a noun. Evangelicals tend not to identify much with their \nparticular churches, preferring to be known as \"mere Christians.\" \nThere are both evangelical Baptists and evangelical Episcopalians, \nthough the Baptist and Episcopal churches are about as far apart as \ncountry music is from classical.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all their diversity, evangelicals hold several principles in \ncommon. This list isn't exhaustive, but here are some key emphases of \nevangelicals:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) Salvation is by faith alone, not works.\u0014\n\u0014\n(2) The Bible is the standard for Christian doctrine and practice.\u0014\n\u0014\n(3) Everyone needs a personal relationship with Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\n(4) \"The church\" means all Christians everywhere, and there is no \n\"true\" or \"perfect\" church this side of heaven.\u0014\nWhen I became disillusioned with the Baptist faith, I eagerly drank \nup the writings of Catholic and Orthodox apologists (often former \nProtestants themselves) who challenged these four principles. I took \nup their arguments and shot off combative e-mails to my evangelical \nfriends. Among other things, I argued that:\u0014\n\u0014\n Salvation by faith alone is not biblical. The only time the words \njustified, faith, and alone appear together in the Bible, it's to say \nthat \"a man is justified by works, not by faith alone\" (James 2:24).\u0014\n\u0014\n Sola scriptura (the idea that the Bible alone is our guidenot \nchurch tradition) isn't found in the Bible, either. Since Scripture \ndoesn't interpret itself, we need an authoritative interpretive \ncommunity to make sense of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n The evangelical focus on a \"personal relationship\" with Christ \ntends to obscure our corporate identity as members of the church. The \nNew Testament writers don't say anything about \"asking Jesus into our \nhearts.\" Instead, they tell us to repent and be baptized into the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jesus and the apostles founded a church, not a loose affiliation of \nfreelance believers. The apostles laid hands on bishops to oversee \nthis church, so as to keep the doctrine pure and prevent schism. This \nchurch must still be around today, because Jesus promised that the \ngates of hell would not prevail against it. I still believe this \ncritique has merit. (So do many evangelicals, who realize that their \ncore principles need some qualification.) But when I consider the \nfour evangelical principles today, I see more to applaud than to \ndisagree with. Why the change?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's Not About Works\u0014\nWhen I became Orthodox, I was tired of what I saw as evangelicalism's \n\"cheap grace.\" I was ready for some discipline and hard work along \nthe path of salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf it's self-discipline you seek, Orthodoxy is definitely the \ntradition for you. The Orthodox Church has devised many ways to deny \nyourself and take up your crossfor example, by abstaining from meat \nand dairy products every Wednesday and Friday, as well as during long \npenitential seasons like Lent, Advent, and the Apostles' Fast. \nMarried couples are encouraged to take it a step further, by \nabstaining from intercourse on these same fast days. (That's not \nsomething Orthodox apologists like to broadcast. When I first heard \nit, I announced to a friend that I could never become Orthodox; \nlater, I learned that few Orthodox follow this custom strictly.)\u0014\n\u0014\nFaced with all this fasting, it's easy to get obsessive. We joined a \nparish of mostly ex-Protestants who, like us, were eager to be good \nOrthodox. We looked down on those \"ethnic Orthodox\" who still eat \ntheir gyros and feta cheese during Lent. During church fellowship \ntimes, our conversations often centered on fasting (i.e., \"What do I \ndo if my parents offer me cheesecake on Friday?\"). Fast-friendly \nrecipes were eagerly exchanged, for everything from \"Lenten pizza\" \n(no cheese) to \"Lenten chocolate cake\" (tastes just like the real \nthing!).\u0014\nOne Sunday, a friend in the church confided to my wife, \"Sometimes, I \nforget it's all about Jesus.\" That's when it hit uswe'd forgotten \nthat it's all about Jesus, too. Most of the time, instead of \noverflowing with God's love, I was just ticked off about not being \nable to eat a burger. Meanwhile, my wife was feeling guilty about \neating dairy products, despite being a nursing mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the process of healing from this legalism, we ended up finding a \nnew church homea Greek one. Now, we're grateful for the relaxed \nattitude of our \"cradle Orthodox\" brothers and sisters. One of the \nfirst things our new priest said to us was, \"Jesus looks at the \nheartnot the belly.\" That doesn't mean we should reject the \nspiritual disciplines of fasting and other \"works,\" he added, but we \nneed to view them as gifts from God. If you try to grasp a spiritual \ngift before it's given to you, you'll crash and burn.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible, the Standard\u0014\nMy wife and I like to joke that we became Orthodox because we wanted \nto belong to a church where we were the \"liberals.\" But for us, the \ncore doctrines of the faith, such as the Virgin Birth or divinity of \nChrist, are not up for discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the core doctrines, there is no definitive teaching on many \nissues of Christian life. When it comes to a disputed issue, you can \nfind an Orthodox saint, monk, theologian, or priest to back up almost \nany argument. How do you know what's right?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the front of the Orthodox Study Bible (yes, there is such a \nthing), there is a section of quotes about Scripture from saints \nthroughout the centuries. Here's one from St. Nikon of Optina (20th \ncentury): \"Read the Holy Gospel, be penetrated by its spirit, make it \nthe rule of your life, your handbook; in every action and question of \nlife, act according to the study of the Gospel. This is the only \nlight of our life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen evaluating any notion about the Christian life, we always have \nto refer to the sourcethe Bible. In the case of fasting, we Orthodox \ncould avoid a lot of problems by listening to Jesus' words\"What goes \ninto a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of \nhis mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean'\" (Matt. 15:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Orthodox Church, no individual saint, bishop, or theologian is \nconsidered infallible. Even the greatest have taught things that were \nlater rejected. To give just one example, St. Gregory of Nyssa was a \ngreat defender of the doctrine of the Trinity, but his ideas about \nuniversal salvation conflicted with Scripture, so they failed to \nenter the mainstream.\u0014\n\u0014\nTradition is not a separate, or superior, source of light from \nScripture. It is a commentary on the Light, helping us adjust our \neyes to its brilliance.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist, Our One Mediator\u0014\nMany Protestant converts to Orthodoxy and Catholicism are looking for \na \"final authority\" on all matters of faith and life. To them, \ndiscerning the truth for yourself sounds like relativism. They are \nanxious to hand over their consciences to an infallible judge.\u0014\nThis is truer of converts to Rome, who often criticize the Orthodox \nfor lack of a single teaching authority. But some Orthodox cling to a \ncult-like obedience to their priest or spiritual father. I know of \none Orthodox monk who told a follower, \"If I tell you to dig a hole \ntoday, and then I tell you to fill it in tomorrow, you must obey me \nwithout questioning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the right circumstances, obedience to authority can be an \nimportant discipline. In his letters, Paul certainly encourages us to \nobey our elders in the Lord. But Spirit-led obedience is joyful, not \noppressive. God gifted us with free will for a reason. He doesn't \nforce obedience. Jesus woos us with the beauty of truth and \nrighteousness, and he desires our free response to his love.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can't hand my free will over to a pope, priest, or spiritual \nfather, even though these can be helpful guides. For example, I \ngreatly admire Pope John Paul II's teachings on marriage and \nsexuality, but I admire them for the beauty and truth I find there, \nnot because I take them to be divine or infallible. I am responsible \nfor my decisions, and I alone will answer for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Part of 'the Church'\u0014\nEvangelicals, Catholics, and Orthodox disagree about the exact \nidentity of \"the church.\" But when the smoke clears, we all agree \nthat everyone under the lordship of Christ, regardless of \ndenominational affiliation, is somehow part of the church. That's the \nimportant thing. Beyond that, I'd rather avoid judgments about who's \nin and who's out of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not arguing for relativism, but humility. Objective truth exists, \nbut our human ability to discern it is limited. In fact, Truth is not \na set of ideasit's a person. Jesus said, \"I am the way and the truth \nand the life.\" We only know Truth as much as we know Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm a grateful member of the Orthodox Church, and I'm happy to talk \nabout the glories of this path as well as the struggles. I believe \nthat the \"trappings\" of Orthodoxyicons, liturgies, rote prayers, and \nother things evangelicals often are suspicious ofcan bring us closer \nto Christ. But when these things become ends in themselvesidols \ninstead of iconswe need to step back and remember what, or who, it's \nall about.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of \"evangelizing\" my evangelical friends, I now hope to learn \nfrom them. Discussing differences is worthwhile, but it's more \nimportant to encourage each other as we grow in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took me a while, but I think I've finally learned what really \nmatters. Liturgical is not enough, sacramental is not enough, \nCatholic is not enough, and Orthodox is not enough. Only Jesus is \nenough.\u0014\n\u0014\nSam Torode is the coauthor (with wife, Bethany) of Aflame: Ancient \nWisdom on Marriage (Eerdmans, 2005).\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today.

    "title": "IVAN THE TERRIBLE, BY A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "By Isabel De Madariaga. The author accomplishes a lot in this \nsignificant biography of the 16th-century Russian czar, \ncontextualizing his life without minimizing his brutality. From a \ncompendious knowledge of both primary and secondary sources, de \nMadariaga shows how Ivan increased his power in an attempt to assert \nhis authority in a vast land still ruled by local princes. He also \nexpanded Russian control to new areas, particularly western Siberia. \nShe doesn't neglect his abuses of power. But the needs of ruling an \nenormous, divided country don't explain that brutalityboth in \nextracting money from the peasantry to pay for his lengthy wars and \nin the capricious violence he inflicted on those he suspected of \ntreason. Here de Madariaga admits the role of psychopathology. Nor \ndoes the author (Russia in the Age of Catherine the Great), a \nprofessor emeritus of Russian studies at the University of London, \nneglect other aspects of Ivan's reign. She deftly describes the \nactive role that religion, magic and astrology played in Ivan's life \nand court. In fact, Ivan's belief that violence was necessary to \npurify himself and his people drove many of his actions, she argues. \nThe book is written for scholars and students, but general readers \nwilling to plow through the dry prose will be amply rewarded with \nwhat is likely to become the definitive work on Ivan for some time. \nIllus., maps not seen by PW. (July)\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe authoritative historians of Ivan IV have been Russian scholars, \nand de Madariaga explains that her biography assesses the \npersuasiveness of their differing interpretations of his personality \nand the significance of his reign. Though possessing this academic \npurpose, de Madariaga embeds it in a narrative of Ivan's life \n(1530-84) that will be of interest to general readers. Enthroned when \na boy, Ivan inherited a complicated set of titles and a government \ndominated by landowning magnates, the boyars. His decimation of the \nboyars, often performed personally and with imaginative sadism, \nendowed Ivan with his fearsome reputation; some historians, notably \nin the Soviet period, considered Ivan's bloodbaths as a ghastly but \nmodernizing passage to a centralized Russian state. More \nrealistically, de Madariaga describes the victims of Ivan's \ncapricious wrath in the context of his superstitions and paranoia \nabout treason. Regarding Ivan as more rational--though hardly \nhumanitarian in foreign affairs, de Madariaga evenly relates his \ndiplomacy and near-continual warfare. Considering him as basically a \nhistorical horror, de Madariaga's expertly presented Ivan the \nTerrible measures up to the moniker. Gilbert Taylor\u0014\nCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved\u0014\n\u0014\nIvan IV, the Terrible (15331584), is one of the key figures in \nRussian history, yet he has remained among the most neglected. \nNotorious for pioneering a policy of unrestrained terrorand for \nkilling his own sonhe has been credited with establishing autocracy \nin Russia. This is the first attempt to write a biography of Ivan \nfrom birth to death, to study his policies, his marriages, his \natrocities, and his disordered personality, and to link them as a \ncoherent whole.\u0014\nIsabel de Madariaga situates Ivan within the background of Russian \npolitical developments in the sixteenth century. And, with revealing \ncomparisons with English, Spanish, and other European courts, she \nsets him within the international context of his time. The biography \nincludes a new account of the role of astrology and magic at Ivans \ncourt and provides fresh insights into his foreign policy. Facing up \nto problems of authenticity (much of Ivans archive was destroyed by \nfire in 1626) and controversies which have paralyzed western \nscholarship, de Madariaga seeks to present Russia as viewed from the \nKremlin rather than from abroad and to comprehend the full tragedy of \nIvans reign.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsabel de Madariaga is emeritus professor of Russian Studies in the \nUniversity of London.

    "words": "Journalist Patricia Raybon, a faculty member at the University of \nColorado at Boulder, has written articles on family and faith in The \nNew York Times Magazine and Newsweek. But the writing challenge \nreached a new level when one of her daughters embraced Islam, another \nbecame pregnant out of wedlock, and her husband faced \nlife-threatening health issues. So did the spiritual challenge, which \nRaybon examines in\"I Told the Mountain to Move\" (Tyndale, 2005). Stan \nGuthrie, a CT senior associate editor, spoke with her.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did your daughter become a Muslim?\u0014\n\u0014\nI have two grown daughters. My youngest daughter, Alana, has always \nbeen the nonconformist. During high school and in college, she began \nto question her faith and ended up in the Nation of Islam. \u0014\n\u0014\nLater in college, Alana encountered friends who happened to be from \nthe Middle East. They criticized the Nation of Islam as not valid, \nand she left it. The next thing I knew, she was declaring Islam to be \nher faith. It was an intense crossroads for me. But as I prayed, I \nfelt God was saying to me, \"Trust me and love her.\" That was a key \nstarting point. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of Christian home did you have?\u0014\n\u0014\nI grew up in a strict home. For us, that meant going to church every \nSunday. For my girls, that meant youth activities, choir, that whole \nprofile. Clearly, I wasn't introducing my children to Jesus. Once you \nknow him, you don't walk away from him. What I introduced them to was \ninstitutional church, to organized activities under the roof of a \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever I did, I thought I was doing the right thing. It did not \nturn out that way.\u0014\nThere are no guarantees for anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even more riveting to me was that my prayers didn't move these \nmountains. I thought, I'm a good Christian, but my household life \ndoesn't look like it. Wouldn't it be interesting if the problem lay \nin my prayer life? So I decided to step back from the mountains and \nstart on this journey to learn how to pray. Some of the mountains \nmoved, in fact. But more importantly, I moved closer to God. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn that closeness, I found that the mountains didn't loom as large. I \nfound that I could have love, peace, joy, grace, patience, kindness, \ngoodness, and self-control if I stayed there and not at the foot of \nmy mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat other lessons have you learned?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've learned that prayer is not about talking as much as listening. \nIt is about enjoying God's presence. So I read the works of Brother \nLawrence, Richard Foster, Oswald Chambers, and Andrew Murray. I won't \ncriticize the African American church, but in the black church, I had \nnever been introduced to any of these classic prayer people. And I'd \nnever heard any African Americans talk about prayer in the same way. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was fascinated that these authors talked about stepping into the \npresence of God and resting there, just being there, not necessarily \nsaying anything, but enjoying refreshment in the presence of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow have things gone with Alana?\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you argue all the time or have a theological debate every time you \nsit down with your teenager or your young adult? Or do you commit to \nbeing a family? We decided to do the latter. God was asking me, \nfirst, to build a family and trust that my daughter's faith walk was \nhis business and that he would work it out. We are in the process of \nliving that out every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you made peace with the situation, or does it still tug at you?\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, it tugs every day. But I trust that God will resolve it, even as \nhe's changing me.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho's your audience?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians who have struggled with prayerboth laity and clergy. I \nheard from a rural pastor who said he had grown weary of shepherding \nhis small flock. My story reminded him that we can have a remarkable \nand personal relationship with our heavenly Father and with each \nother in spite of problems. That's why I say that my circumstances \nare not as important as the struggle to learn how to address any \namount of circumstances through prayer. That's a struggle a lot of \npeople of faith understand. I wonder if we don't talk more about \nprayer success than about the journey. It's the journey that matters \nmore.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today. \u0014\nDecember 2005, Vol. 49, No. 12, Page 74\u0014",

    "words": "June 11, 1963: Tuscaloosa, Alabama, The University of Alabama campus. \nVivian Malone, a young black woman, enrolled as a student at the \nuniversity, but not without opposition. Federal troops were there to \nensure her entrance into the school, but her way was blocked by \nGovernor George Wallace. Holding out for racism and segregation, the \ngovernor failed in his attempt. Vivian became the first \nAfrican-American student ever to graduate from the University of \nAlabama.\u0014\n\u0014\nVivian wasn't the only African-American that day seeking to enroll at \nthe university. James Hood was at her side, but he was scared and \nneeded encouragement. Vivian helped him along and slipped him a \nsimple little note, a prayer: \"Whatever may be our adversary this \nday, our Father, help us to face it with courage, for it can be \nconquered when thou art with us. In faith we pray in the name of \nJesus. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Wallace came to regret his actions of June 11, and years \nlater was taken in his wheelchair into the Dexter Avenue Baptist \nChurch in Montgomery, and there asked the black people to forgive him \nfor his hardness. The governor also regretted how he treated Vivian \nthat day and sought out her forgiveness. He wanted to make amends \nbefore he died, and he wanted to meet her. Vivian did meet him and \ntold him that she had already forgiven him years earlier. Interviewed \nin 2003, she was asked about this:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You said you'd forgiven him many years earlier?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh yes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And why did you do that?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHer reply: \"This may sound weird. I'm a Christian, and I grew up in \nthe church. And I was taught thatjust as I was taught that no other \nperson was better than Ithat we were all equal in the eyes of God. I \nwas also taught that you forgive people, no matter what. And that was \nwhy I had to do it. I didn't feel as if I had a choice.\"\u0014",

The judge in his case says the \n41 year old clearly violated Islamic law by converting to \nChristianity. \"If he doesn't regret his conversion, the punishment \nwill be enforced on him,\" the judge said. \"And the punishment is \ndeath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chicago Tribune has changed its headline from \"Afghan man faces \ndeath for being a Christian\" to \"Afghan man faces death for \nabandoning Islam.\" But both the judge and prosecutor (Rahman doesn't \nhave a defense attorney) have said his crime isn't just conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is illegal to be a Christian and it should be punished,\" the \njudge was quoted as saying in the Toronto Globe and Mail. Prosecutor \nAbdul Wasi told The Times of London, \"We are Muslims and becoming a \nChristian is against our laws. He must get the death penalty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA human rights expert in Kabul lays out the problem in The Times: \n\"The constitution says Islam is the religion of Afghanistan, yet it \nalso mentions the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article \n18 specifically forbids this kind of recourse. It really highlights \nthe problem the judiciary system faces.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judiciary seems not to have a problem. It's just disregarding \nwhat it considers Western law. It's all a matter of perspective, the \njudge explained to The Times: \"In your country two women can marry. I \nthink that is very strange. In this country we have the perfect \nconstitution. It is Islamic law.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chicago Tribune notes that \"Islamic rules are violated in \nAfghanistan every daywhether by alcohol being sold openly on the \nstreets, or by prostitutes who cater to both foreigners and Afghans, \nor by the booming opium trade.\" But religion is still a hot button, \nthe paper says: \"One Afghan liberal scholar, Ali Mohaqeq Nasab, spent \nalmost three months in jail last fall after publishing a magazine \nchallenging many traditional views on Islamic law, including the \nbelief that Muslims who convert to other religions deserve to die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Colson is mad. \"Is this the fruit of democracy?\" he asks on \ntoday's Breakpoint radio commentary. He continues:\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this why we have shed American blood and invested American \ntreasure to set a people free? What have we accomplished for \noverthrowing the Taliban?  I have supported the Bush \nadministration's foreign policy because I came to believe that the \nbest way to stop Islamo-fascism was by promoting democracy. But if we \ncan't guarantee fundamental religious freedoms in the countries where \nwe establish democratic reforms, then the whole credibility of our \nforeign policy is thrown into serious question.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers, including Al Mohler and Family Research Council's Tony \nPerkins are raising similar questions. It may be that nothing would \nturn evangelicals against military action abroad quicker than \nRahman's execution would.\u0014",

Let fire and cross, flocks of \nbeasts, broken bones, dismemberment  come upon me, so long as I \nattain to Jesus Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIgnatius was going to die. He knew it. He wanted it. The only \npossible problem, as he saw it, was meddling Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nTimeline\u0014\n4\tB.C. Birth of Jesus\u0014\n14\tDeath of Augustus\u0014\n30\tCrucifixion of Jesus; Pentecost\u0014\n35\tIgnatius born\u0014\n107\tIgnatius dies\u0014\n120\tPapias is bishop of Hierapolis\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I fear your kindness, which may harm me,\" he wrote to Roman \nChristians hoping to free him. \"You may be able to achieve what you \nplan. But if you pay no heed to my request, it will be very difficult \nfor me to attain unto God.\" And that was truly Ignatius's goal: to \nimitate \"our God Jesus Christ\" in death. If Christians really wanted \nto do something, they should pray that he would remain faithful. \"If \nyou remain silent about me, I shall become a word of God. But if you \nallow yourselves to be swayed by the love in which you hold my flesh, \nI shall again be no more than a human voice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Ignatius truly wanted to die was about as much as we know about \nhis martyrdom. It's not even known for certain that he was killed, \nthough that's likely.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the second (or third) bishop of Antioch, one of the most important \nchurches of the day, he was certainly one of the most prominent \nChristians of the time immediately succeeding the apostles. But \nAntioch was also home to some religious debates, and while Ignatius \ndenounced division as \"the beginning of evil,\" the bishop engaged in \ndebate with tenacity.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the Magnesian church (near Ephesus) he wrote scathingly of the \nEbionites, who demanded the keeping of Jewish regulations. \"It is \noutrageous to utter the name of Jesus Christ and live in Judaism.\" \nSimilar attacks were launched against the Docetists, who believed \nChrist only appeared to be human. Anyone believing such nonsense that \nChrist only seemed to suffer could not truly be called a martyr, he \nasserted.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was probably arrested on the charge of \"atheism\"denial of the \nRoman godsand was taken from Antioch to Rome by an escort of ten \nsoldiers. At nearly every stop, he met leaders of local churches, and \nduring the trip he penned, with the help of a secretary, seven \nletters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough most famous for being one of the church's earliest martyrs, \nhis letters also served to record the rapid development of church \nhierarchy. \"Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed \nthe Father,\" he wrote to Polycarp's church at Smyrna (now Izmir, \nTurkey). \"Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even \nas wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the catholic church. It is \nnot lawful apart from the bishop either to baptize or to hold a \nlove-feast [church meal],\" he continued in his letter to Smyrna. The \ninstruction is also remarkable because it is the first recorded use \nof the phrase \"catholic [meaning, universal] church.\" (He was also \nthe first outside the New Testament to speak of Jesus' virgin birth.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe details of Ignatius's death are lost to history, but not his \ndesire to have his life count for something: \"Now I begin to be a \ndisciple  Let fire and cross, flocks of beasts, broken bones, \ndismemberment  come upon me, so long as I attain to Jesus Christ.\"\u0014",

    "words": "\"In Response to . . . Billy Graham on the Mystery of Salvation\"\u0014\nBy Bruce T. Gourley\u0014\n\u0014\n          They both grew up in the South, and for much of their lives \nboth have been Southern Baptists.  Both have studied the Bible \nextensively, yet both preach a Gospel which is foreign to todays \nSouthern Baptist leaders.  One is well known within Baptist academic \ncircles, the other is one of the most recognizable world figures of \nthe late 20th and early 21st centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Our faith does not require that we believe that God \npermits no knowledge of God except through Jesus, one says.  We \nshould not ever try to limit how God can speak.  God acts creatively \nand redemptively in the world. We should let God draw the boundaries \nof creation, judgment and redemption . God will never abandon . God \nwill never close the door . Gods love will prevail.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Those are decisions only the Lord will make, echoes the \nother, addressing the issue of whether heaven is closed to Jews, \nMuslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other non-Christians.  It would be \nfoolish for me to speculate about all that. I believe the love of God \nis absolute. He said he gave his son for the whole world, and I think \nhe loves everybody regardless of what label they have.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Yet despite their shared view that salvation exists beyond \nChristendom, one of the two is dismissed as a heretic by \nfundamentalist Baptists, while the other is embraced as a hero.  \nAfter decades of opposing Kirby Godsey, fundamentalist leaders of the \nGeorgia Baptist Convention purified themselves from any association \nwith Godseys liberal beliefs by defunding Mercer University in the \nfall of 2005.  The same year, after decades of claiming evangelist \nBilly Graham as one of their own, fundamentalist leaders of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention led their constituency to vote to \ncommission a huge statue in Grahams honor.  There is no \nbetter-known name in the entire world, when it comes to being a \nperson of faith, than Billy Graham, SBC president Bobby Welch \nproclaimed of the evangelist for which Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary named a school.\u0014\n\u0014\n          It is seemingly bizarre that two well known Baptists who \npublicly acknowledge salvation beyond Christendom are treated so \ndifferently by fundamentalists.  The story of how Godsey (the author \nof the first quotation in this article, published in his 1996 volume, \nWhen We Talk About God  Lets Be Honest) became a heretic and Graham \n(the author of the second quotation, in the August 14, 2006 edition \nof Newsweek) became a hero is a reflection of how a once dynamic and \ngrowing denomination has been transformed into a declining, \nculturally-bound, politically-captive and increasingly irrelevant \nbody.  In light of decades of failed evangelistic and baptismal \nefforts, the Southern Baptist Convention needs the name, if not the \ntheology, of the worlds greatest evangelist.  When the statue of \nGraham was unveiled in June 2006 at the annual SBC meeting, Southern \nBaptist leaders applauded his evangelistic fervor, impassioned \npreaching style, and innovative use of media, but were noticeably \nsilent regarding Grahams theology.  In the Newsweek interview Graham \nexpressed regret for not pursuing graduate education.  Yet if the \nworlds greatest evangelist had pursued an academic career instead of \nholding revivals in stadiums worldwide, he would not have been \nhonored by a convention which despises open scholarly inquiry and \nscoffs at honest reflection upon the mysteries of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Billy Graham recognizes, now more than ever, the inclusive \nnature of Gods love and the freedom that is the very heart of the \nGospel he has faithfully preached to hundreds of millions of persons \nover six decades.  Moderate Baptists would do well to learn from his \nevangelistic fervor; fundamentalist Baptists would do well to learn \nfrom his inclusive theology.\u0014",

The motivation for these phony admissions, says criminologist \nJim Fisher, author of Fall Guys: False Confessions and the Politics \nof Murder, can be \"mental illness or extreme guilt over another \ncrime, or they're just yearning for the attention a big case brings, \nthe chance to be in the history books.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat quest for notoriety has fueled legions of false confessions to \nhigh-profile crimes. After Charles Lindbergh's infant was kidnapped \nand murdered in 1932, more than 200 people stepped up to say they \nwere the culprit. Over the years, 500 or so have confessed to \nHollywood's 1947 \"Black Dahlia\" slaying.\u0014\nOthers may lie for more practical reasons. In 1965, when handyman \nAlbert DeSalvo told police he was the Boston Strangler, he confessed \nto having brutally murdered 13 women. Some experts now suspect that \nDeSalvo, who at the time was in custody on lesser charges, hoped the \nlavish claims would bolster his rep in prison and save him from \nexecution via an insanity plea.\u0014\n\u0014\nConvicted arsonist Ottis Elwood Toole twice confessed to abducting \nAdam Walsh, 6, whose 1981 disappearance inspired his father John's \nadvocacy for missing children. But Toole also twice recanted. Some \nbelieve he wanted to cash in on book and film deals.\u0014",

It was one thing to believe \nBlondin could do what they had all seen him do, and another to put \nyour life in his hands letting him push you across the falls on the \nhigh wire. \u0014\n(Encyclopedia Britannica)\u0014\nIf you trust God, then get into the wheelbarrow....\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Blondin (28 February 1824  19 February 1897), French \ntight-rope walker and acrobat, was born at St Omer, France. His real \nname was Jean Franois Gravelet. When five years old he was sent to \nthe Ecole de Gymnase at Lyon and, after six months training as an \nacrobat, made his first public appearance as \"The Little Wonder\". His \nsuperior skill and grace as well as the originality of the settings \nof his acts, made him a popular favorite.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe especially owed his celebrity and fortune to his idea of crossing \nNiagara Falls on a tight-rope, 1100 ft. long, 160 ft. above the \nwater. This he accomplished, first in 1859, a number of times, always \nwith different theatric variations: blindfold, in a sack, trundling a \nwheelbarrow, on stilts, carrying a man on his back, sitting down \nmidway while he made and ate an omelette.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1861 Blondin first appeared in London, at the Crystal Palace, \nturning somersaults on stilts on a rope stretched across the central \ntransept, 70 ft. from the ground. In 1862 he again gave a series of \nperformances at the Crystal Palace, and elsewhere in England, and on \nthe continent.\u0014\nIn 1873, he crossed Edgbaston Reservoir in Birmingham. A statue built \nin 1992 on the nearby Ladywood Middleway ring road marks his feat.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a period of retirement he reappeared in 1880, his final \nperformance being given at Belfast, Ireland in 1896. He died at \nEaling, London and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\u0014",

Mike Nifong\u0014\n\u0014\nRALEIGH, N.C. 1/25/07  (AP) -- The state bar lodged new and more \nserious ethics charges Wednesday against the district attorney in the \nDuke lacrosse case, accusing him of withholding evidence from the \ndefense and lying to both to the court and bar investigators.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Nifong - who withdrew from the case earlier this month - could \nbe disbarred if convicted by a disciplinary board.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bar previously charged Nifong with making misleading and \nprejudicial comments about the athletes under suspicion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new charges are tied to Nifong's decision to use a private lab \nfor DNA testing as his office investigated allegations three men \nraped a 28-year-old stripper at a team party last March.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose tests uncovered genetic material from several men on the \nwoman's underwear and body, but none from any lacrosse player. The \nbar complaint alleges that those results were not released to the \ndefense and that Nifong repeatedly said in court he had turned over \nall evidence that could benefit the defense.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If these allegations are true and if they don't justify disbarment, \nthen I'm not sure what does,\" said Joseph Kennedy, a law professor at \nthe University of North Carolina. \"It's hard for me to imagine a more \nserious set of allegations against a prosecutor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new charges \"have significantly increased the chances for a \nserious sanction, possibly including suspension or disbarment,\" said \nThomas Metzloff, a Duke law professor and member of the bar's ethics \ncommittee, which is not involved in prosecuting the case against \nNifong.\u0014\n\u0014\nNifong's trial on the ethics charges is set for May, though bar \nofficials said Wednesday they expect it to be delayed until June.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe declined to comment Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'd say any time any charges are filed with the state bar, they're \nall serious, and we want to make sure we handle them all properly,\" \nsaid his attorney David Freedman.\u0014\n\u0014\nCiting the conflict of interest created by the ethics charges, Nifong \nasked the North Carolina attorney general's office earlier this month \nto take over the lacrosse case.\u0014\n\u0014\nNifong dropped rape charges against the three athletes in December \nafter the accuser changed a key detail in her account, but the \nplayers are still charged with sexual offense and kidnapping.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorth Carolina's attorney has said he will conduct a thorough review \nof the remaining charges against Dave Evans, Collin Finnerty and \nReade Seligmann.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2007 The Associated Press.

    "title": "IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PROPHET - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Reviewer: JOSEPHINE F.\u0014\nSPIN ON ISLAM AND ITS FOUNDER\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad did not overcome poverty, he married a very rich woman. His \nideas came from Christians. He started a religion by killing anyone \nwho would not accept his religion and killing 800 Jews who lived in \nhis hometown. A prophet? He never prophesied anything. He married a \nchild of 6 years and had intercourse with her at age 9. Recently a \nSaudi woman was raped by five men and they gave her rapers 27 strokes \nand she got 90. The Qur'an told them to. To believe in one god is \ngood, but it seems that Islam does not follow God's law of LOVE. I \nsuggest \"Why I am Not a Muslim,\" written by a previous Muslim who \nactually read the Qur'an and found that it calls for killing \nChristians and Jews. He immediately became a Christian. Two other \ngood books are \"The Truth About Muhammad\" and \"A Brief History of \nSaudi Arabia,\" The author says, the Quran is misinterpreted, but do \nthe Muslims misinterpret it? Don't be impressed by the author's kudos \nfrom others. Listen to truth in your hearts.\u0014\n------------\u0014\nPublisher's Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\nLondon-based Ramadan, the Oxford research fellow who authored Western \nMuslims and the Future of Islam, is probably best known for being \ndenied entry into the United States, based on alleged violations of \nthe Patriot Act. This excellent, engaging book ought to turn public \nattention back toward Ramadan as a writer and a skilled interpreter \nof Islamic history. In deliberately brief chapters, Ramadan brings \nMuhammad to life. He highlights Muhammad's resolute faith in spite of \nsetbacks like orphanhood and poverty, and upholds the prophet as a \nspiritual herobravely compassionate and unusually tolerant of \nothers, including non-Muslims. Ramadan notes his extraordinary \nkindness, even to those he battled. For example, a slave who had been \ngiven to Muhammad turned down emancipation, saying he preferred \nservice to Muhammad over freedom with anyone else. (Muhammad \nimmediately freed the slave and adopted him as his own son.) Similar \ntales of mercy lace through Muhammad's life: in the midst of a battle \nmarch, Muhammad advised his troops to be careful not to hurt a litter \nof puppies on the roadside; on another occasion, Muhammad released \nprisoners of war because they had taught community children how to \nread and write. Ramadan ably demonstrates why Muhammad is a spiritual \nparagon to the followers of Islam. (Feb.)\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information\u0014\n------\u0014\nNamed by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important innovators of \nthe century, Tariq Ramadan is a leading Muslim scholar, with a large \nfollowing especially among young European and American Muslims. Now, \nin his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous \nbiography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual \nand ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human \nhistory. Here is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a \nlife that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan \nprovides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but \ndetermined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched \na great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan \npresents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that \nhighlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores \nthe significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most \ncontroversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of \nwomen, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with \nother religions. Selecting those facts and stories from which we can \ndraw a profound and vivid spiritual picture, the author asks how can \nthe Prophet's life remain--or become again--an example, a model, and \nan inspiration? And how can Muslims move from formalism--a fixation \non ritual--toward a committed spiritual and social presence? In this \nthoughtful and engaging biography, Ramadan offers Muslims a new \nunderstanding of Muhammad's life and he introduces non-Muslims not \njust to the story of the Prophet, but to the spiritual and ethical \nriches of Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author\u0014\nTariq Ramadan is a Research Fellow at St. Antony's College, Oxford \nUniversity and the Lokahi Foundation (London). He is the author of \nWestern Muslims and the Future of Islam; Islam, the West, and the \nChallenges of Modernity; and To Be a European Muslim.\u0014",

The \nyounger one used a gun. They died 38 days apart.\u0014\n\u0014\nBethel, population 6,000, is a hub for scores of villages smaller and \nmore remote.\u0014\nCharles Mason for The New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMemorial programs on a bench built for two brothers who killed \nthemselves this year.\u0014\nEnlarge This Image\u0014\nCharles Mason for The New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Waska home. The family was preparing to hold a memorial feast for \none son when a second, younger son killed himself with a gun.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey had lived in this muddy town of 6,000 people, a hub at the \ncenter of scores of much smaller and more remote native villages in \nthe Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska. Their parents taught \nthem to hunt for geese and seals and to fish for pike and herring and \nsalmon. They taught them to speak their native Yupik and to cut wood \nfor steam baths each night, even as one son played electric guitar \nand the family surfed the Internet.\u0014\n\u0014\nSit, said Evon Waska, the father, directing two visitors to a \nfreshly finished wooden bench in his living room. Mr. Waska had \nplaced it like a pew before a makeshift memorial of cards and \nphotographs of the dead. Sit with us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was heartbroken, he said, I put my sorrow into making that \nbench.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn grieving for the older son, William George Kinzy, 34, who died on \nMarch 8, and his half-brother, Evon David Waska Jr., 20, who shot \nhimself on April 15, Mr. Waska and his wife, Dora, are suffering a \ncruel concentration of the kind of loss that so many others in \ncommunities like theirs confront.\u0014\n\u0014\nRural Alaska has some of the highest rates in the world for \nsuicide, said Ron Perkins, who came to Alaska three decades ago to \nwork for the federal governments health program for Native Alaskans \nand now is executive director of the Alaska Injury Prevention Center, \na nonprofit organization. I remember talking once to an elder in a \nvillage outside Kotzebue. He said, I was 20 years old before I first \nheard of a suicide, and then it was a white man in Kotzebue. Now, if \na native kid is 10 and hasnt heard of a suicide, its rare.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suicide rate among Native Alaskans was three times that of \nnonnative Alaska residents and five times the national rate from 2003 \nto 2006, according to a study Mr. Perkins helped conduct.\u0014\n\u0014\nContrasts are also striking in the ages of those committing suicide. \nNationwide, people 80 and over and those in their 40s are most likely \nto kill themselves. Among Alaska natives, the 20-to-29 age group had \nthe most suicides, 39 percent of the total, while that age group \nranked seventh nationwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nNatives ages 10 to 19 make up just 20 percent of the state population \nin that age group, but accounted for 61 percent of its suicides.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suicide rates for natives declined somewhat in 2005 and 2006, but \nMr. Perkins said it was too soon to know whether that reflected a \npattern. Roughly 80 percent of all Alaska suicide victims are male.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuicide among natives is commonly linked with depression and mental \nillness, which often goes untreated in rural areas, as well as with \nalcoholism and cultural and economic stress. Many native families are \nreluctant to discuss suicide, adding to the challenge, Mr. Perkins \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nNative death rates over all are about 50 percent higher than for \nnonnatives, according to data compiled by the Institute of Social and \nEconomic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Natives are \nincreasingly moving to urban areas from rural villages and native \nfamilies are increasingly led by a single parent. Women are more \nlikely than men to move to cities to find work.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheyve lost their culture, they dont have a way to support their \nfamily, and then what we see is a lot of alcohol and drug use, \nparticularly alcohol, said Diane Casto, the section manager for \nprevention and early intervention for the states division of \nbehavioral health. Theres such a feeling of hopelessness, \nparticularly for young men.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian missionaries, followed by government bureaucracy and modern \ntechnology, have long since transformed villages on the tundra into \nplaces where seal meat is hung out to dry in the shadow of steeples, \npublic schools and satellite dishes. Many natives still hunt and fish \nfor staples even as the outside culture promotes materialism. Experts \nsay young people often have frayed connections to the old ways but \npoor preparation for living in a modern world.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you move out, how do you move on? said Yvonne Kinegak, an \nintake supervisor for the Bethel branch of the states Office of \nChildrens Services. We see healthier people when theyre more \nconnected to their culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie Bradbury, who teaches Sunday school at United Pentecostal \nChurch in Bethel, where her husband is the pastor, said that deaths \namong natives, many of whom in the delta are Russian Orthodox, are \nrepeatedly memorialized through feasts at various anniversaries. Evon \nDavid Waska Jr. killed himself as his family was preparing for a \nfeast on the 40th day after his half-brother died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey think, well, if they dont think much of me now, maybe they \nwill when Im dead, Ms. Bradbury said, echoing a common view.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Perkins, who conducted the suicide study, acknowledged that \nperception but said he knew of no way to confirm it. Misperceptions \nabout native suicides are common, he said, including the belief that \nmore people kill themselves during the dark Alaskan winters.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe found that suicides occurred all during the year, he said, \nnoting that December, one of the darkest months, had one of the \nlowest suicide rates.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlcohol or drugs were a factor in nearly three-fourths of the \nsuicides among natives, the same as for nonnatives. And while about \ntwo-thirds of all suicides were from gunshot wounds, natives were \ntwice as likely to hang themselves as were nonnatives, even though \ngun ownership is high among natives.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Perkins said that efforts were being made to help people maintain \ntheir connection to native culture and language, but that some groups \nless likely to speak their native language, like the Aleuts, had \nrelatively low suicide rates.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheyre past that cultural transition, he said.\u0014",

A new documentary, ISLAM: WHAT THE WEST NEEDS TO KNOW [July \n17, 2007 - Disinformation Company] challenges that very sentiment and \nfinally asks the question,\u0014\n\u0014\n                         IS ISLAM ITSELF A VIOLENT RELIGION?\u0014\n\u0014\nDirectors Gregory M.

She started licking her and\u0014\n         loving her. Within a couple of days, Honey started naturally\u0014\n         lactating, said Kathy Martin, Jimmys wife. The kitten took\u0014\n         right to her, and she started nursing her.\u0014\n          \u0014\n         Jimmy Martin noticed the kitten, whom the family\u0014\n         dubbed Precious, about six weeks ago, when she ran in\u0014\n         front of his concrete truck. After following her and realiz- \u0014\n         ing there was no mother cat in sight, he took her home.\u0014\n          \u0014\n         The kitten refused to drink from a bottle, and Jimmys\u0014\n         mother, Ruth Martin, feared Precious would die.\u0014\n          \u0014\n         The family initially tried to keep Precious and Honey\u0014\n         apart, fearing the dog would play too rough with the gray-\u0014\n         striped kitten. But Honey was elated at Precious presence,\u0014\n         wagging her tail and prancing all over the house trying to\u0014\n         sneak a peek at her. Eventually, the family let Honey ap-\u0014\n         proach Precious, and the dog immediately took to her.\u0014\n          \u0014\n         The Martins, who told a veterinarian about Honey and\u0014\n         Precious, said they learned that interspecies nursing does\u0014\n         happen on rare occasion. Precious now sometimes\u0014\n         plays with dog bones, and Honey lets Precious gnaw on\u0014\n         her like a puppy would. She thinks shes a dog,\u0014\n         Kathy Martin said.

Do any evangelical theologians \nbelieve this?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: The traditional teaching of the churchthat the lost will suffer \nunending conscious torment in hellhas repeatedly been challenged by \n\"universalists\" since the third century. They believe that in the \nend, all will be saved. After the Reformation, a third viewpoint, \n\"annihilationism\" emerged as a minority positionfor example, in the \n1660 confession of the General Baptists, and among the Seventh-day \nAdventists and several other evangelical groups in the nineteenth \ncentury. Since 1960, several prominent British evangelicals, as well \nas Canadian theologian Clark Pinnock, have embraced this view. John \nStott has likewise expressed sympathy for annihilationism while \nchoosing to remain \"agnostic\" on the question.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne key difference between universalists and annihilationists is that \nannihilationists agree with traditionalists that many will indeed be \nlost eternally. By this, however, they mean that the unsaved will \ncease to exist for all eternity. They argue that because eternal \ntorment serves no remedial purpose, the traditional concept of hell \npaints a portrait of God as a vindictive despot incompatible with the \nloving Father revealed in Jesus. Further, they claim that the \npresence of people in hell throughout eternity contradicts the \nChristian truth that Christ has conquered every evil foe and God will \nreconcile all things in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome annihilationists who are better described as holding to \n\"conditional immortality\" claim the idea of eternal conscious \npunishment depends on the Greek concept of the immortality of the \nsoul, which they say is wrongly read back into the New Testament.\u0014",

    "title": "IN KENTUCKY'S TEETH, A TOLL OF POVERTY AND NEGLECT",
    "words": "December 24, 2007 N.Y.Times\u0014\n                         In Kentuckys Teeth, Toll of Poverty and \nNeglect\u0014\n                                        By IAN URBINA\u0014\n\u0014\nBARBOURVILLE, Ky.  In the 18 years he has been visiting nursing \nhomes, seeing patients in his private practice and, more recently, \ndriving his mobile dental clinic through Appalachian hills and \nhollows, Dr. Edwin E. Smith has seen the extremes of neglect.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has seen the shame of a 14-year-old girl who would not lift her \nhead because she had lost most of her teeth from malnutrition, and \nthe do-it-yourself pride of an elderly mountain man who, unable to \nafford a dentist, pulled his own infected teeth with a pair of pliers \nand a swig of peroxide.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has seen the brutal result of angry husbands hitting their wives \nand the end game of pill-poppers who crack healthy teeth, one by one, \nto get dentists to prescribe pain medications.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut mostly he has seen everyday people who are too busy putting food \non the table to worry about oral hygiene. Many of them savor their \nsweets, drink well water without fluoride and long ago started \nruining their teeth by chewing tobacco and smoking.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Smith has a rare window on a state with the highest proportion of \nadults under 65 without teeth, where about half the population does \nnot have dental insurance. He struggles to counter the effects of the \ndrastic shortage of dentists in rural areas and oral hygiene habits \nthat have been slow to change.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe level of need is hard to believe until you see it up close, \nsaid Dr. Smith, who runs a free dental clinic at a high school in one \nof Kentuckys poorest counties. He also provides free care to about \nhalf of the patients who visit his private practice in Barbourville.\u0014\n\u0014\nKentucky is among the worst states nationally in the proportion of \nlow-income residents served by free or subsidized dental clinics, and \nless than a fourth of the states dentists regularly take Medicaid, \naccording to 2005 federal data.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil August 2006, when the system was revamped, the states Medicaid \nreimbursement rate was also one of the lowest in the country. Experts \nsay this contributed to the shortage of dentists in poorer and more \nrural areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe state dental director, Dr. Julie Watts McKee, said that last \nyear, Medicaid reimbursement for childrens dental services was \nraised by about 30 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even with this increase, which was paid for by cutting \northodontic benefits, reimbursement fees remain about 50 percent \nbelow market rate, said Dr. Ken Rich, the states dental director for \nMedicaid. And for adults, Dr. Rich said, they are about 65 percent \nbelow market rate.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot much has changed over the years here, really, said Glen D. \nAnderson, who for two decades has made dentures in Corbin, Ky. He \nsells a pair of dentures for $400 that many dentists sell for more \nthan $1,200. Like his brother, father and grandfather, he makes them \nwithout a license.\u0014\n\u0014\nBootleggers exist here for a reason, Mr. Anderson said. People \nneed teeth, but they cant afford to go to dentists for dentures.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Kentucky may have some of the worse oral health problems in the \nnation, it is by no means alone. Residents in neighboring states \nacross the region suffer similar dental problems for many of the same \nreasons  inadequate access to dental care or the inability to pay \nfor a dentist, widespread use of chewing tobacco and a pervasive \nassumption that losing teeth is simply part of growing old. West \nVirginia, for example, which has the highest proportion of people \nover 65 without teeth, also has one of the lowest percentages of \nadults who visit the dentist at least once a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Smith is trying to catch these problems before they progress. \nEach week, he drives his mobile clinic, Kids First Dental Care, up \nthe windy Appalachian roads to visit schools and to provide free \ncheck-ups to children in the poorest counties of Kentucky.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Smith paid about $150,000 of his own money to build the mobile \nclinic inside an 18-wheel truck. The clinic has a staff of seven and \noperates with private and Medicaid financing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPain caused by dental problems is a leading cause of missed school \ndays in Kentucky, according to state health officials, and almost \nhalf of the states children ages 2 to 4 have untreated cavities. \nAbout 1 in 10 state residents are missing all their teeth, according \nto 2004 federal data.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his private practice, Dr. Smith said that at least once a month he \nsees a patient who has used Krazy Glue to reattach a broken tooth to \nthe root or to an adjacent tooth. Just as often, he sees patients who \nhave tried to avoid the cost of a dentist by swishing with rubbing \nalcohol to deal with a tooth infection or by rubbing crushed aspirin \npills on gums to numb pain. Both tactics worsen the situation by \nburning the gums and creating ulcers, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Medicaid, Dr. Smith said, the only choice a person with a \nsevere infection has is to have the tooth pulled, even if shes 25 \nyears old and the tooth is right in the middle of her face. He added \nthat the program does not pay for root canals or dentures, though it \ndoes help pay for a liquid diet for those without teeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedicare, the federal governments health insurance program for \nseniors, does not pay for dental services.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Smith said some people assumed that if their parents and \ngrandparents lost their teeth before they were 40, they would too. \nThey figure no teeth, no costly toothaches, so they pre-emptively \npull them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTry finding work when youre in your 30s or 40s and youre missing \nfront teeth, said Jane Stephenson, founder of the New Opportunity \nSchool in Berea, Ky., which provides job training to low-income \nAppalachian women.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Stephenson said the program started helping women buy dentures 10 \nyears ago. She said about half of the women who go through the \nprogram, most in their 40s, were missing teeth or had ones that were \ninfected. As a result, she said, they are shunned by employers, \nashamed to go back to school and to be around younger peers and often \nmiss work because of pain or complications of the infections.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis teeth crooked and blackened, Justin Baker is the face of another \nreason for Kentuckys oral hygiene problems: methamphetamine use.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey just rotted, Mr. Baker, 16, said about the damage done in less \nthan a year of drug use.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2006, Kentucky law enforcement seized 342 meth labs and made more \nthan 32,000 arrests related to methamphetamine. The previous year, \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy designated Kentuckys \nlargest city, Louisville, among 23 nationwide that were hot spots of \nmethamphetamine use.\u0014\n\u0014\nKentucky also has the highest rate of cigarette smoking in the \ncountry and one of the highest proportions of chewing tobacco use. \nSmoking and chewing tobacco, which account for more than half of all \ncases of periodontal disease in the United States, often lead to oral \ncancer and can encourage the growth of the bacteria that erode teeth \nand eat away at the gums.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mr. Baker sat up to rinse and spit at a free dental clinic at his \nschool, Knox Central High School in Barbourville, Dr. Smith shook his \nhead.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though he is turning his life around, the damage is done, Dr. \nSmith said about the likelihood that Mr. Baker would soon lose all \nhis teeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe consequences of oral hygiene problems are far reaching, Dr. Smith \nsaid. When teeth fall out, he explained, the mouth loses some of its \nstructural support and turns in on itself; that can lead to distorted \nspeech and, in the absence of dentures, force a person to eat only \nsoft foods, which can lead to poor nutrition.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in the southeast Kentucky city of Corbin, Mr. Anderson, the \nmaker of dentures, said, People shouldnt be ashamed to smile.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing up, Mr. Anderson said he and his brother moved around  from \nMassachusetts to Florida to Oklahoma and, finally, to Corbin  \nwhenever local dentists complained to the police about their fathers \ndenture-making practice. In 1990, he said, their father moved to \nWashington State to practice legally after repeated arrests in \nKentucky.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American Dental Association objects to denturism, as the trade is \ncalled, because it says practitioners have not received proper \ntraining through dental school. They are not competent to diagnose \ncancers or other diseases in the mouth, the association says, or to \nspot broken roots of teeth, which can lead to injury if not corrected \nbefore the installation of dentures.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenturists are allowed to practice independently in Idaho, Maine, \nMontana, Oregon and Washington. In Arizona and Colorado, they can \npractice with at least limited supervision of a licensed dentist, \naccording to the National Denturist Association.\u0014\n\u0014\nPointing to the wall where his license to practice the trade in Maine \nis mounted, Mr. Anderson said he trained in a program at George Brown \nCollege in Toronto. He has continued to practice in Kentucky even \nthough it is illegal because no one complains about the quality of \nhis work, he said, and he has a licensed dentist on staff and in his \noffice several days a week.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is that we see people dentists dont because those people \nare too poor, said Glen Andersons brother, Eric Anderson, 36. And \ntherere a lot of these people around here.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeated in Glen Andersons office, David Caldwell, 53, smiled widely \nas he stared into a mirror at his first pair of dentures. Mr. \nCaldwell attributed his dental problems to his smoking habit. He said \nhe quit smoking but still chews tobacco.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou get in the habit of keeping your mouth shut if youre in \npublic, Mr. Caldwell said about the embarrassment of having no teeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, with his full set of false teeth, he said he could stop talking \nwith his hand in front of his mouth. He could stop tilting his head \ndownward, so people would only see his lower, less damaged teeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm a new man, I suppose, he said with a shy laugh.\u0014",

He spoke to her about \nhis vision of the future.

He anticipated that there \nwould be suffering for him and his family, and he did not want to put \nher through such suffering.

    "words": "NFL running back Shaun Alexander writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the University of Alabama, I was meeting women from a lot of \ndifferent backgrounds. My mother had taught me never to exploit \nwomenthat sex was meant only for marriageand to treat women with \nrespect. I knew the boundary lines it wasn't right to cross I knew \nif I didn't keep my focus, I could fall. And it could occur anytime.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne time it almost did. It happened the first year of college when \nI'd gone home for a visit. To protect her privacy, I'll call her \nSherron. One night we were alone in my room while my mom was gone. We \nwere kissing, and I thought seriously about having sex with her. But \nsomething in me kept whispering, This isn't right.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust then the phone ran. It was my mother, and she asked, \"Is \neverything good, Shaun?\" \u0014\n\"Uhyeah, Mom,\" I said. \"It's good.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What's going on?\" she asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh, nothing,\" I answered. \"Sherron is here and we're going to go out \nand eat and probably go to a movie. Something like that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Okay, that's fine,\" Mom said. \"I'm going to stay in Covington with \nyour grandma, so I'll call you tomorrow.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAs I hung up, thoughts raced through my mind. What am I doing here? \nSomething isn't right about this. This is so easy and nobody else \nwill know. But I'll know, and God will know. It was more than \nwrestling with my thoughts. I was in a full-out fight. I had to \ndecide who my body would serve.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust then, Sherron leaned close to me and whispered, \"I've brought \ncondoms.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMy thoughts were racing. Mainly I was thinking, Am I one of those \nrotten guys who says he loves Jesus but folds when it's easy or when \nhe won't get caught? \"No, we can't do this,\" I finally said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why not?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're not supposed to.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What does that mean?\" Sherron asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nI jumped up and pulled her to her feet. \"It means we're going out.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI hurried her out to the car, and we drove to the mall. That was the \nclosest I ever got to having sex before marriage. Mom's phone call \nhad kept me from making a big mistake. Many times I've been grateful \nto my mother for calling exactly when she did.\u0014\n\u0014\nShaun Alexander, in his book Touchdown Alexander (Harvest House, \n2007);\u0014",

    "title": "INDULGENCES--WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE NOT",
    "words": "The word indulgence (Latin indulgentia, from indulgeo, to be kind or \ntender) originally meant kindness or favor; in post-classic Latin it \ncame to mean the remission of a tax or debt. In Roman law and in the \nVulgate of the Old Testament (Isaiah 61:1) it was used to express \nrelease from captivity or punishment. In theological language also \nthe word is sometimes employed in its primary sense to signify the \nkindness and mercy of God. But in the special sense in which it is \nhere considered, an indulgence is a remission of the temporal \npunishment due to sin, the guilt of which has been forgiven.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat an indulgence is not\u0014\n\u0014\nTo facilitate explanation, it may be well to state what an indulgence \nis not. It is not a permission to commit sin, nor a pardon of future \nsin; neither could be granted by any power. It is not the forgiveness \nof the guilt of sin; it supposes that the sin has already been \nforgiven. It is not an exemption from any law or duty, and much less \nfrom the obligation consequent on certain kinds of sin, e.g., \nrestitution; on the contrary, it means a more complete payment of the \ndebt which the sinner owes to God. It does not confer immunity from \ntemptation or remove the possibility of subsequent lapses into sin. \nLeast of all is an indulgence the purchase of a pardon which secures \nthe buyer's salvation or releases the soul of another from Purgatory. \nThe absurdity of such notions must be obvious to any one who forms a \ncorrect idea of what the Catholic Church really teaches on this \nsubject.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat an indulgence is\u0014\n\u0014\nAn indulgence is the extra-sacramental remission of the temporal \npunishment due, in God's justice, to sin that has been forgiven, \nwhich remission is granted by the Church in the exercise of the power \nof the keys, through the application of the superabundant merits of \nChrist and of the saints, and for some just and reasonable motive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn essential element in indulgences is the application to one person \nof the satisfaction performed by others. This transfer is based on \nthree things: the Communion of Saints, the principle of vicarious \nsatisfaction, and the Treasury of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee Catholic Encyclopedia \n(http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm) for full discussion of \nabove issues.\u0014",

He was also sentenced to 100 \nlashes for adultery, but was not given the death penalty because he \nwas married.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudiciary officials were not immediately available for comment. It \nwas not known when the slaying took place or when the two were \nconvicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the ruling is final, Iran's judiciary chief or the country's \nsupreme leader are authorized to stop death sentences from being \ncarried out.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Iran's Islamic laws, adultery is the only capital offense \npunishable by stoning. A man is usually buried up to his waist, while \na woman is buried up to her neck.

Albert Ellis notes eleven of \nthe\u0014\n         irrational beliefs or ideas most common in our society: \u0014\n\u0014\n            1. It is a dire necessity for an adult human being to be \nloved\u0014\n               or approved by virtually every significant other in \nhis or\u0014\n               her community.\u0014\n            2. One should be thoroughly competent, adequate, and \nachiev-\u0014\n               ing in all possible respects if one is to consider \noneself\u0014\n               worthwhile.\u0014\n            3. Certain people are bad, wicked, or villainous and \nshould\u0014\n               be severely blamed and punished for their villainy.\u0014\n            4. It is awfulcatastrophicwhen things are not the way\u0014\n               one would very much like them to be.\u0014\n            5. Human unhappiness is externally caused, and people have\u0014\n               little or no ability to control their sorrows and \ndisturbances.\u0014\n            6. If something is or may be dangerous or fearsome, one\u0014\n               should be terribly concerned about it and should keep\u0014\n               dwelling on the possibility of its occurring.\u0014\n            7. It is easier to avoid than to face certain \ndifficulties and\u0014\n               responsibilities in life.\u0014\n            8. One should be dependent on others; one needs someone\u0014\n               stronger than onself on whom to rely.\u0014\n            9. Ones past history is an all-important determiner of \nones\u0014\n               present behavior, and because something once strongly \naf-\u0014\n               fected ones life it should indefinitely have a \nsimilar effect.\u0014\n            10. One should beep me quite upset over other peoples \nprob-\u0014\n               lems and disturbances.        \u0014\n            11. There is invariably a right, precise, and perfect \nsolution\u0014\n               to human problems, and it is catastrophic if this \nperfect\u0014\n               solution is not found.\u0014",

Rigorous \nscientific analysis has since shown that there was no evidence that \nthe fire in a one-story, wood frame house in Corsicana was the result \nof arson, as the authorities had alleged. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, it was an accident. No crime had occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nCameron Todd Willingham, who refused to accept a guilty plea that \nwould have spared his life, and who insisted until his last painful \nbreath that he was innocent, had in fact been telling the truth all \nalong.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jury took barely an hour to return a guilty verdict, and \nWillingham was sentenced to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe remained on death row for 12 years, but it was only in the weeks \nleading up to his execution that convincing scientific evidence of \nhis innocence began to emerge. A renowned scientist and arson \ninvestigator, Gerald Hurst, educated at Cambridge and widely \nrecognized as a brilliant chemist, reviewed the evidence in the \nWillingham case and began systematically knocking down every \nindication of arson. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe authorities were unmoved. Willingham was executed by lethal \ninjection on Feb. 17, 2004.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow comes a report on the case from another noted scientist, Craig \nBeyler, who was hired by a special commission, established by the \nstate of Texas to investigate errors and misconduct in the handling \nof forensic evidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report is devastating, the kind of disclosure that should send a \ntremor through ones conscience. There was absolutely no scientific \nbasis for determining that the fire was arson, said Beyler. No basis \nat all. He added that the state fire marshal who investigated the \ncase and testified against Willingham seems to be wholly without any \nrealistic understanding of fires. He said the marshals approach \nseemed to lack rational reasoning and he likened it to the \npractices of mystics or psychics.\u0014",

Mr. Whitmore \nsent in a clipping for which he had no author, only a title: \"Is the \nChurch Costing Too Much?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Last Sunday, another golfer sank the last putt on the 18th green and \nreceived a check for $50,000 for four rounds of golf, plus an \nautomobile for himself and one for his wife. This week, the papers \nreported that a certain popular singer will receive $100,000 per week \nfor her current singing engagement. Americans spend, annually, more \non dog food than on church contributions. It is not unusual for an \nindividual to pay more for his country club membership than he gives \nto the church. Is the church costing too much?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let me share an experience with you. On June 2, 1940, a little girl \nwas born to us. She cost us money from the moment she was born. As \nshe grew from babyhood to girlhood, she cost even more _ her dresses \nand shoes were more expensive, and we had to have the doctor through \nall those childhood diseases.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She was even more expensive during her school and teen years. She \nneeded long dresses to go to parties. When she went to college, we \ndiscovered, along with other parents, that all college expenses are \nnot listed in the catalog. Then after graduation, she fell in love \nand married. She was married in a church wedding and that, too, cost \na lot of money.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then, five months after her marriage, she suddenly sickened and \nwithin a week, she was dead. She hasn't cost us a penny since the day \nwe walked away from her grave.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As long as the church is alive, she will cost money. And the more \nalive a church is, the more money she will cost. Only a dead church, \nlike a dead child, is no longer expensive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Think it over.

    "title": "INDICATIONS OF STAGNATION",
    "words": "Nothing defeats the human spirit like stagnation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are my candidates for the top diagnostic indicators of a \nministry moving into \"slow deterioration\" mode. You may know of some \ngroup (or individual) that needs to do a little self-assessment:\u0014\n\u0014\n        Denial. The capacity of emperors to think they are making \nfashion statements is staggering. Gary Hamel has a wonderful line: \nsuccess tends to be self correcting. The very process of being \neffective also tends to bring complacency, and when effectiveness \ngoes down, we tend not to see it. (As Gary puts it: every successful \norganization is successful until it's not. Companies pay him lots of \nmoney for these kind of observations.) If evangelistic fervor cools, \nor prayer decreases, or community lessens, or volunteerism fades, \nthose of us at the center are sometimes the last to know.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Loss of motivation. People do not lose motivation simply \nthrough age, or challenge, or even repetition. They lose motivation \nwhen they lose a sense that they are able to grow. People rarely plan \nvacations to spend two weeks sitting on the beach at the Dead Sea.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Fewer people signing up to lead. My nephew is going through \ntraining to join the California Highway Patrol. Because he is based \nnearby, he sometimes spends weekends with us. The ordeal that CHiPs \nofficers-to-be put up with is remarkable. Many of them do not make it \nthrough training. Those that do pay an enormous price of commitment. \nThe very price he's paying is part of what makes him value the badge. \nI can't help but contrast this with leading in the church. \nSeminariesand churcheswill all-too-often take in any warm body \nthat's available. It is not higher salaries and longer sabbaticals \nthat will draw people into serving the churchit's a sense of urgent \ncalling that demands a sacrifice and promises the opportunity to make \na difference.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Phoning it in. Funny how this one gets sensed by everyone \naround a person before it gets sensed by the phon-ee himself. Sermons \nget perfunctory; teams lose morale, planning gets second-rate effort, \naccountability for results diminishes; and there is a general \ncollusion to not name the dynamic.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Cynicism. When other ministries are being effective, instead \nof producing joy, it creates a sense of envy or a feeling of being \nthreatened. Rather than seeking to learn from it, stagnant people \nwill find some pretext for judging or dismissing it.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Spending more time looking in the rearview mirror than out \nthe windshield. More stories get told about how things once were than \nabout what may yet be. Who wants to be watching the road when all \nthat's left is a dead end?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news is that stagnation is never inevitable.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Ortberg is editor at large of Leadership and pastor of Menlo \nPark Presbyterian Church in Menlo Park, California.\u0014",

    "title": "IS SUICIDE THE UNPARDONABLE SIN?",
    "words": "Is suicide the \nunpardonable sin?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps you have heard people say that suicide is unpardonable or \nunforgivable by God. This idea is often based on the belief that the \nperson who commits suicide is unable to ask for and receive \nforgiveness after the act and, therefore, receives eternal \npunishment. Indeed, you can't ask for forgiveness after you are dead. \nBecause suicide is self-murder, it is sinful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe act of suicide does not, however, condemn anyone to eternal \npunishment and separation from God. Salvation and eternal life are \ngifts that God freely gives to all who acknowledge their sinfulness \nto God and trust personally in the death of Christ on the cross as \nthe just payment for their sinfulness (John 3:16; Eph. 2:89; Rom. \n8:3133; 2 Cor. 5:21).\u0014\n\u0014\nSalvation for any person rests in the finished work of Jesus Christ \non the cross, not in abstaining from sinful acts. Our committing \nsuicide in and of itself does not condemn us to eternal punishment \nany more than does any other sin for which we have not asked \nforgiveness at the time of death (see 1 Cor. 3:915; 2 Cor. 5:10). \nFor the Christian, there is no individual act or sin that can erase \nsalvation, change eternal destiny, or separate the believer from \nGodincluding suicide (Rom. 8:1, 3739). We are by our very nature \nsinful, and any of the many sins we commit throughout our lives would \ncondemn us to separation from God (Rom. 3:23; 6:23) if there was no \ncross upon which the debt of a believer's past, present, and future \nsin has been eternally paid. The biblical passages from which the \nidea of an unpardonable sin is derived, such as Hebrews 6, typically \nneither have in view an individual sin (action) nor something that is \nunpardonable. They challenge people who are at risk of faltering in \ntheir walk with God to stay in close relationship with God, who is \never faithful to forgive and sustain them. A possible exception is \nMark 3:2830. But even there Jesus emphasizes that all sins, except \nrejecting the redemptive work of the Holy Spirit in one's life, can \nbe forgiven.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalvation and suicide are two separate issues. We all have committed \nmany sins throughout our lives. We all need salvation, totally apart \nfrom the issue of suicide. Each person must choose to accept or \nreject the death of Jesus Christ for his of her own life.\u0014\nThe destiny of anyone you have known who has already committed \nsuicide was not settled by the act of suicide; it was settled by his \nor her relationship with Christ. That relationship may have been \npublic or private. Even that person, for any number of reasons, may \nhave been uncertain about it. God, however, is not uncertain as to \nthe identity of His children, so we must rest in His mercy, love, and \neternal promises. Suicide is normally a very private act, and what \nmay have transpired spiritually in those final moments of despair is \nknown only to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasic Questions on Suicide and Euthanasia: Are They Ever Right?\u0014\nCopyright 1998 by The Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity\u0014",

    "words": "Mark Moring recounts a Sports Illustrated story perhaps some of you \nhave read about an unusual member of the Northwest High football team \nin McDermott, Ohio. Jake Porter was born with fragile-X syndrome, a \nchromosomal condition that left him unable to read or write his name \nand dealing with a variety of other issues we associate with mental \nretardation. But Jake Porter loved football. He attended every \npractice. He bounced up and down with joy at the sight of other \nplayers. And, in his senior year, Dave Frantz, the Northwest coach, \ndecided to honor this heart. Before a game against Waverly High in \nthe fall of 2002, coach Frantz called Derek Dewitt, the head coach at \nWaverly. The two agreed to allow Jake to run one play at the end of \nthe game. Jake would get the ball, take a knee, the game would end.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith five seconds left in the chosen game, Waverly was leading \nNorthwest 42-0. Coach Frantz called a timeout. Jake was called out to \nthe huddle, and the two coaches met at midfield. Rick Reilly of \nSports Illustrated picks up the story here: \"Fans could see there was \na disagreement. Dewitt was shaking his head and waving his arms. \nAfter a ref stepped in, play resumed and Jake got the ball. He \nstarted to genuflect, as he'd practiced all week. Teammates stopped \nhim and told him to run, but Jake started going in the wrong \ndirection. The backfield judge rerouted him toward the line of \nscrimmage.\" As a determined Jake Porter rushed toward an apparent \nmauling at the huge Waverly line, \"suddenly, the Waverly defense \nparted like peasants for the king.\" Suddenly, Jake was not one boy \nalone. He was surrounded by 21 teammates, all urging him to go for \nthe goal. In the stands, mothers cried and fathers roared. Players on \nboth sidelines held their helmets to the sky and whooped.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently when the coaches met before the big play, Frantz had \nreminded Dewitt of the plan, that Jake would simply take a knee. But \n[coach] Dewitt wasn't satisfied. He said, \"No, I want [your boy] to \nscore.\" Frantz objected, but Dewitt insisted. Dewitt called his \ndefense over and said, \"They're going to give the ball to number 45. \n[I want you to] open up a hole and let him score!\" And so Jake had \nthe run of his life. With arms churning and face grinning, Jake \nPorter scored \"the touchdown heard round the world,\" and claimed his \nvarsity letter.\u0014",

    "title": "ISAAC WATTS BIRTHDAY SERMON",
    "words": "July 17, 1698 \u0014\nIsaac Watts' Birthday Sermon\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the annals of hymn writing, Isaac Watts shines as a leading \nluminary. In most Reformation countries, hymns were employed in \nworship but seldom in the English church before Watts was born. \nAnglicans sang the Psalms. Psalm singing, which had at first been a \nwelcome innovation, become a dreary, unmelodious chanting. Each line \nwas first read out by a clerk and then sung. Through Isaac Watts' \ninfluence, that changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts was born in Southampton, England on this day July 17, 1674. He \nfell under conviction in 1688 and learned to trust Christ in a \npersonal way a year later. No doubt his father's influence was felt \nhere, for his father was twice imprisoned for refusing to bend to the \nChurch of England beliefs. Later Isaac refused to take an \nall-expenses-paid education rather than conform himself to the Church \nof England. After attaining his education under more difficult \ncircumstances, Watts became a preacher. He gave his first sermon on \nthis day, his birthday, July 17, 1698, at Mark Lane in London. His \nqualities were such that the church soon named him its assistant \npastor. Shortly afterward he became seriously ill and suffered such \npoor health the remainder of his life that he was often unable to \ncarry out his church duties.\u0014\n\u0014\nA kindly friend, Sir Thomas Abney took him under his roof and there \nhe lived thirty years. The church also showed much wisdom and charity \nin continuing to support him despite his fevers and neuralgia. A lady \nwho fell in love with him from reading his hymns is said to have \nrejected him close up upon finding him small and far from handsome.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his lack of beauty, Watts wrote inspiring poems which were \nattractive to worshippers. Scarcely a hymnbook today in the English \nspeaking nations is without one or more of his hymns. Psalm singing \nhad fallen into a sad state and church leaders were seriously \nquestioning what to do. Watts boldly called for a new kind of psalm, \nrewritten in light of the New Testament gospel. \"We preach the gospel \nand pray in Christ's name, and then check [stifle] the aroused \ndevotions of Christians by giving out a song of the old dispensation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nActing on his own word, he published a collection of Christianized \npsalms in 1719. Even before this, in 1707, he published his Hymns and \nSpiritual Songs. They include \"Joy to the World.\" These, not his \nsermons, are his true gift to the church and inspired Charles \nWesley's even more successful endeavors.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts faced fierce opposition. Many church leaders were opposed to \nhis efforts and some called his hymns \"Watt's Whims.\" The common \npeople, however, delighted in them. Eventually the Church of England \nrevised its stand and began adding hymns to their worship. His most \nfamous songs point to Christ:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I survey the wondrous cross\u0014\non which the Prince of glory died, \u0014\nmy richest gain I count but loss, \u0014\nand pour contempt on all my pride.\"\u0014",

The old slave did no \nwork at all, while Paulus tended to him, gave him the best food, and \nmade him rest. \u0014\n\u0014\nProculus was curious, so he confronted Paulus, \"Who is this slave? \nYou know I value you. I don't mind your protecting this old man. But \ntell me who he is. Is he your father who has fallen into slavery?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaulus answered, \"It is someone to whom I owe more than to my father.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Your teacher, then?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No. Somebody to whom I owe even more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who then?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is my enemy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Your enemy!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes. He is the man who killed my father and sold us, the children, \nas slaves.\" Proculus stood speechless.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As for me,\" said Paulus, \"I am a disciple of Christ, who has taught \nus to love our enemies and to reward evil with good.\"\u0014",

    "title": "IN JESUS' NAME",
    "words": "In Jesus' Name\u0014\nMust Christians pray in public forums using Jesus' name?\u0014\nCompiled by Ruth Moon | posted 9/27/2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe North Carolina General Assembly is reviewing its policies on \nguest chaplains after Winston-Salem pastor Ron Baity was told he \ncould not pray in Jesus' name. Meanwhile, the group Atheists of \nFlorida is suing the City of Lakeland over its opening invocations \n\"in Jesus' name.\" Several governmental bodies around the country are \nfacing similar fights.\u0014\n\"The Christian faith demands that we pray in the name of Jesus. A \nprayer has to have an address, just like a letter has to have an \naddress. Jesus said in John 14:13 that 'whatsoever you shall ask in \nmy name, that will I do.'  The apostle Paul writing to Timothy in 1 \nTimothy 2 said that there is one mediator between God and man: the \nman Christ Jesus.\u0014\nOne of the great tragedies of the hour is that people have the idea \nthat they can just throw a prayer up and God's obligated to answer \nthe prayer. God has a prescribed manner of approach. That manner of \napproach is through his son, Jesus Christ.\"\u0014\nRon Baity, pastor, Berean Baptist Church\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is unequivocal demand that Christians not be ashamed of the \nSon of Man. So we can't disguise that aspect of who we are; and \nreally, if the government wants to integrate religion into its \nprocesses  there's no such thing as generic prayer. It's not \nsuperstition, it's not magic  it's talking to God. I don't think we \ncan be asked to set aside our Christian distinctives, because then \nit's not really prayer. We're just sort of window-dressing, moral and \ntheological window-dressing for the function of the state, and I \nthink that does harm to the mission of the church. On the flip side, \nChristians should do whatever they need to do to demonstrate the \nlordship, supremacy, and uniqueness of Christ. And if that's \nunacceptable in whatever public function it is, then Christians \nshould respectfully bow out.\"\u0014\nTyler Wigg-Stevenson, author, \\Brand Jesus\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In public praying, I think Christians attempt to be as hospitable as \nthey can, knowing there are people from other faiths there. On the \nother hand, we pray in Jesus' name, whether we mention Jesus or not. \nSo whether Jesus' name is mentioned, we do have to pray in Jesus' \nname. That would mean when I pray a public prayer, I want to sound \nlike a Christian, and I'm not offended if somebody comes up and says \n'Gee, that was a Christian prayer.' I think, 'Well, you know I'm a \nChristian.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Willimon, bishop, North Alabama conference of the United \nMethodist Church\u0014\n\"We pray to God, and the God we pray to is the Father, Son, and Holy \nSpirit, and we know God as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit because \nJesus is the Son of God. So prayer must be directed to the \nappropriate subject. That means we pray not to some vague God but to \nthe Father of Jesus Christ. So prayer is appropriately \nChristocentric, since it's to God.\"\u0014\nStanley Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics, Duke Divinity \nSchool\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christians always pray in Jesus' name, because that's the only way \nwe pray. That is to say, from a biblical perspective, to pray in \nJesus' name is to pray in his authority seeking his agenda and \npurpose. That doesn't have anything to do with whether we say the \nwords 'in Jesus' name' at the end of our prayer or not. In fact, when \nJesus taught his disciples to pray, in what we call the Lord's \nprayer, he didn't teach us to pray saying 'in Jesus' name' or 'in my \nname' at the end of the prayer. That's a fine tradition for us, \nbecause it reminds us that we are in fact praying in Jesus name, but \nwhether or not we say those words has nothing to do with whether \nwe're actually praying in Jesus' name or not.\"\u0014\nMark D. Roberts, senior director, Laity Lodge\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the controversies over legislative prayer, Christians should be \nespecially mindful to pray in a way that does not tend to associate \nthe government with a particular religious perspective. Current \ncontroversies over legislative prayer come out of using a government \nforum to push a particular type of prayer. That pushes the boundaries \nof constitutional law and threatens to send the message that the \ngovernment is a proper forum for pursuing particular matters of \nfaith.\"\u0014\nHollyn Hollman, general counsel, Baptist Joint Committee for \nReligious Liberty\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Praying in the name of Jesus doesn't necessarily make the prayer \nwork or get the e-mail faster to God; it does very little other than \ndeclare who I am and with what relationship I bring this prayer.  I \ndon't think it's a simple thing. And I don't think it has to do with \ncourage. On the other hand, I think it has to do with what we are to \nbe: uniquely, profoundly sensitive to the people around us. Not that \nwe are not Christian then; we know what we are. But sometimes you \ntear relationships apart.\"\u0014\nWalter Wangerin, Jr. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When Christians happen to be in settings where they're not gathered \ntogether specifically as Christians  for instance, on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives  then I think they should not pray in \nJesus' name. In that kind of setting, while I'm sure that it's quite \npossible to offer sincere prayer in Jesus' name, I think the \ntemptation to offer that kind of prayer for insincere reasons is far \ntoo great to make it legitimate. The fact is that in certain parts of \nthe country, in certain very large parts of the country, to very \nlarge numbers of Americans, a politician praying explicitly in Jesus' \nname is like, 'Oh, hey, I'm going to vote for that guy because he \nprays in Jesus' name.'  It can end up devolving into almost a logo.\"\u0014\nJonathan Malesic, author, \\Secret Faith in the Public Square: An \nArgument for Christian Identity\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2010 Christianity Today\u0014",

I endure all things \nthat I may suffer together with him, since he who became perfect man \nstrengthens me.\" What an attitude!\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was merely the outworking of the faith he had preached for many \nyears. \"We have not only to be called Christians, but to be \nChristians,\" he had written.

    "words": "November 9, 1865 \u0014\nIndia's Praying Hyde\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Give me Souls, O God, or I die!\" That became the plea of John Hyde, \nborn on this day, November 9, 1865 in Carrollton, Illinois. John's \nfamily were praying people. Consequently, as a young man, he learned \nto pray expecting results.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's brother Edmund went as a student missionary to Montana, where \nhe contracted a fever and died. John wondered if he should take \nEdmund's place. During his senior year at McCormick Theological \nSeminary, he came to the room of his friend Mr. Konkle near midnight, \nsaying he wanted all Konkle's arguments in favor of going to the \nforeign mission field. \"I told him that he knew as much about the \nforeign field as I did; that I didn't believe it was argument that he \nneeded, and that I thought the way for him to settle it was to lay it \nbefore our Father and stay until He decided for him: We sat in \nsilence a while longer, and, saying he believed I was right, he rose \nand bade me good night.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning Konkle felt a hand on his arm. Looking around, he \nsaw John's face radiant with a new vision. \"It's settled, Konkle,\" \nsaid he.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn left for India. Aboard ship, he opened a letter from a friend \nwho wrote that he would pray until John was filled with the Holy \nSpirit. Angrily John crumpled the letter and hurled it aside. He had \nyielded his heart to the Lord, gotten his degree, studied Indian \nlanguages and was obediently on his way to a life work. How dare his \nfriend suggest he lacked the Spirit? But when he cooled down, he \nrealized that his friend was right. He pleaded for the power of the \nHoly Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result was that John became a notable intercessor, one who pleads \nfor the souls and needs of others. He was nicknamed \"Praying Hyde.\" \nHe often paid for his concern with sleepless nights.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevival began when he came late to a meeting one evening. \"I have \nbeen having a great controversy with God. I feel that he has wanted \nme to come here and testify to you concerning some things that he has \ndone for me, and I have been arguing with him that I should not do \nthis. Only this evening...have I got peace concerning the matter and \nhave I agreed to obey him, and now I have come to tell you just some \nthings that he has done for me.\" John told them how God had freed him \nfrom certain sins. Soon his listeners were weeping and confessing \ntheir own.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1908, anguished by the sight of sin and souls doomed to hell, he \nasked the Lord to bring a soul a day into the kingdom of God. Soon he \nupped that to two souls, and then four. God answered his prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in March of 1911, Hyde had to say good-bye to India. His heart \nhad shifted in his chest and required medical attention. In the \nUnited States it was found he had a malignant brain tumor. Surgery \nwas necessary. On February 17, 1912 he died. His last words were \n\"Shout the victory of Jesus Christ!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGordon, Ernest. A Book of Protestant Saints.

    "words": "Jim Cymbala, Pastor of Brooklyn Tabernacle, tells the following \nstory: It was Easter Sunday and I was so tired at the end of the day \nthat I just went to the edge of the platform, pulled down my tie and \nsat down and draped my feet over the edge. It was a wonderful service \nwith many people coming forward. The counselors were talking with \nthese people. As I was sitting there I looked up the middle aisle, \nand there in about the third row was a man who looked about 50, \ndisheveled, filthy. He looked up at me rather sheepishly, as if \nsaying, \"Could I talk to you?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWe have homeless people coming in all the time, asking for money or \nwhatever. So as I sat there, I said to myself, though I am ashamed of \nit, \"What a way to end a Sunday. I've had such a good time, preaching \nand ministering, and here's a fellow probably wanting some money for \nmore wine.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe walked up. When he got within about five feet of me, I smelled a \nhorrible smell like I'd never smelled in my life. It was so awful \nthat when he got close, I would inhale by looking away, and then I'd \ntalk to him, and then look away to inhale, because I couldn't inhale \nfacing him. I asked him, \"What's your name?\" \"David.\" \"How long have \nyou been on the street?\" \"Six years.\" \"How old are you?\" \"32.\" He \nlooked 50 -- hair matted; front teeth missing; wino; eyes slightly \nglazed. \"Where did you sleep last night, David?\" \"Abandoned truck.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI keep in my back pocket a money clip that also holds some credit \ncards. I fumbled to pick one out thinking; I'll give him some money. \nI won't even get a volunteer. They are all busy talking with others. \nUsually we don't give money to people. We take them to get something \nto eat. I took the money out. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid pushed his finger in front of me. He said, \"I don't want your \nmoney. I want this Jesus, the One you were talking about, because I'm \nnot going to make it. I'm going to die on the street.\" I completely \nforgot about David, and I started to weep for myself. I was going to \ngive a couple of dollars to someone God had sent to me. \u0014\n\u0014\nSee how easy it is? I could make the excuse I was tired. There is no \nexcuse. I was not seeing him the way God sees him. I was not feeling \nwhat God feels. But oh, did that change! David just stood there. He \ndidn't know what was happening. I pleaded with God, \"God, forgive me! \nForgive me! Please forgive me. I am so sorry to represent You this \nway. I'm so sorry. Here I am with my message and my points, and You \nsend somebody and I am not ready for it. Oh, God!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSomething came over me. Suddenly I started to weep deeper, and David \nbegan to weep. He fell against my chest as I was sitting there. He \nfell against my white shirt and tie, and I put my arms around him, \nand there we wept on each other. The smell of his person became a \nbeautiful aroma. Here is what I thought the Lord made real to me: If \nyou don't love this smell, I can't use you, because this is why I \ncalled you where you are. This is what you are about. You are about \nthis smell. \u0014\n\u0014\nChrist changed David's life. He started memorizing portions of \nScripture that were incredible. We got him a place to live. We hired \nhim in the church to do maintenance, and we got his teeth fixed. He \nwas a handsome man when he came out of the hospital. They detoxed him \nin six days. He spent that Thanksgiving at my house. He also spent \nChristmas at my house. When we were exchanging presents, he pulled \nout a little thing and he said, \"This is for you.\" It was a little \nwhite hanky. It was the only thing he could afford. \u0014\n\u0014\nA year later David got up and talked about his conversion to Christ. \nThe minute he took the mic and began to speak, I said, \"The man is a \npreacher.\" This past Easter we ordained David. He is an associate \nminister of a church over in New Jersey...and I was so close to \nsaying, \"Here, take this; I'm a busy preacher.\" We can get so full of \nourselves.\u0014",

SHEAR  12/20/10   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON  In an interview that set off a new round of debate on \nMonday about racial attitudes and politics, Gov. Haley Barbour of \nMississippi, a potential Republican presidential candidate, recalled \nthe 1960s civil rights struggle in his hometown, Yazoo City, saying, \nI just dont remember it as being that bad. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a profile published Monday in The Weekly Standard, Mr. Barbour \nalso talked about the White Citizens Councils of the late 1960s, \nwhich opposed racial integration. Mr. Barbour, a teenager and young \nadult during the 1960s, said that in his town, they were a positive \nforce, praising them as an organization of town leaders who refused \nto tolerate the racist attitudes of the Ku Klux Klan. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started \na chapter of the Klan would be run out of town, Mr. Barbour said. \nIf you had a job, youd lose it. If you had a store, theyd see \nnobody shopped there. We didnt have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo \nCity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe comments came as Mr. Barbour, 62, is actively considering a bid \nfor the White House, and the governors political opponents and some \ncivil rights groups quickly seized on the remarks. \u0014\n\u0014\nMedia Matters, a liberal organization, sent e-mail messages to \nreporters Monday urging coverage of the comments. Derrick Johnson, \npresident of the Mississippi N.A.A.C.P., told The Huffington Post, \nIts beyond disturbing  its offensive that he would take that \napproach to the history of this state to many African-Americans who \nhad to suffer as a result of the policies and practices of the \nCitizens Council.\u0014",

If Julius loved to fight, Leo \npreferred amusement. His self-indulgence destroyed the unity of the \nwestern church when he bartered sin for money in the most infamous \nindulgence of church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom birth Leo had been earmarked for the church. At the age of seven \nhe was made a monk. By thirteen he was a cardinal. In between, the \nboy had been abbot. He became pope before turning forty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis tastes were costly. He was only too happy to spend lavishly on \nhimself and voluptuous entertainment. Humanists with few morals \nswarmed at a papal court where wit mattered more than witness. Plays \nand shows, ballets and games abounded. No chance for a hunt was \nturned down. The papal treasury funded preeminent artists such as \nRaphael. Julius left a full treasury. Leo drained it in eight short \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's basilica was being rebuilt, but there was no money. Leo \ndecided to solve the problem in time-honored fashion. On this day \nMarch 15, 1517 he declared that anyone who contributed to the \ncathedral would be granted an indulgence. Although in theory an \nindulgence was only a remission of penalties meted out in this world \nby the church, in practice it was hawked as if it covered the actual \nguilt of sins and could release souls from Purgatory. The gist of the \nindulgence was as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...[I] absolve you ...from all thy sins, transgressions, and \nexcesses, how enormous soever they be...and remit to you all \npunishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account and I \nrestore you...to the innocence and purity which you possessed at \nbaptism; so that when you die the gates of punishment shall be \nshut... and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain \nin full force when you are at the point of death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent to preach the indulgence in Germany was a Dominican named \nTetzel. Tetzel got above himself in his promises, implying that the \nindulgence even covered the future sins which the buyer was now \nharboring in his heart. Frederick the Wise refused to allow the \nindulgence to be preached in his territory of Saxony, mostly because \nhe was reluctant to allow Saxon coin to leave his \nfinancially-depleted realm. Tetzel came as near the border of Saxony \nas he could. Folk from Wittenberg crossed over and bought the prized \npapers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterwards a few doubted the efficacy of the writs. They solicited \nthe opinion to a middle aged monk named Martin Luther. Luther refused \nto confirm their value. Instead, in an accepted tradition, he posted \ntheses for debate on the door of Wittenberg castle church where a \nlarge crowd was expected. The sequel is well known. From those \nninety-five theses the Reformation was born when Leo refused to see a \nproblem with the disgraceful sales.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H. Here I Stand.

    "words": "The death of 14-year-old Hena Akhter spotlights concerns the \ninternational response to sexual assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nElissa Cooper    4/3/11\u0014\n\u0014\nLast July, Bangladesh's High Court declared fatwas, a ruling or legal \nopinion given by an Islamic religious leader, illegal. Investigations \nand news reports of fatwas invoking violence against women led human \nrights organizations to submit petitions to the court, which then \ntook action.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the practice is still used in Bangladesh, particularly in rural \nvillages, and not always documented. The first reported case of fatwa \nsince the ruling occurred last November when 40-year-old Sufia Begum \nwas brutally caned for an alleged affair. Although doctors suggested \nshe be taken to another hospital that could better tend to her, her \nfamily claimed they could not afford to move her. Begum died in \nDecember from her injuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nViolence against women, such as sexual assault, is a global problem; \nApril marks Sexual Assault Awareness Month in the U.S. Bangladesh is \njust one country where the problem is spelled out on the \ninternational scene. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn January 31, 14-year-old Hena Akhter died after a fatwa ordered her \nto receive 101 lashes. Her crime was that she allegedly had an affair \nwith a married man; her family says the man, a 40-year-old cousin, \nraped her. The cousin was sentenced to 201 lashes, which he did not \nundertake.\u0014\n\u0014\nBangladeshi authorities condemned Akhter's fatwa, which occurred over \n50 miles away from the capital, Dhaka. This is against the rules of \nIslam, said Haji Abdul Wahab Bepari, chairman of the Naria \nsub-district. We don't have these strict Shari'ah laws in our \ncountry. The villagers should have stopped this.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities were further outraged when it appeared that the fatwa was \ndeliberately hidden. Police officers have been investigated for their \nreport; now, four doctors are facing charges of hiding the cause of \nAkhter's death. Their autopsy report ruled that it was a suicide and \nthere were no injuries. A second autopsy was ordered by the court, \nwhich found severe injuries on the body and claimed the girl had bled \nto death. Justice Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik of the High Court said, \nWe are appalled to see the magnitude of illegality. Other justices \nsimilarly decried the doctors' actions and their audacity to \nfabricate the suicide story.\u0014\n\u0014\nBangladesh professes to be a moderate Muslim-majority country (of its \npopulation of 160 million people, almost 90 percent falls in this \ncategory). But it faces the difficult task of changing cultural \nmentality, as well as enforcing punishment against those who carry \nout fatwas. Chowdhury called for the ministry of religious affairs to \ncease funding for the mosques and madrassas (Muslim schools) that \norder fatwas.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that enough? Akhter's case brings up another problem: the response \nto sexual assault. Nicholas Kristof blogged, Let's hope that the \npublic reaction and punishments are so strong that the word goes out \nto all of Bangladesh's villages that such misogynist fatwas are not \nonly immoral but also illegal. And that the crime lies not in being \nraped, but in raping.\u0014",

He began learning Latin at age four \nand went on to learn Greek, Hebrew, and French as well. From an early \nage Isaac had a propensity to rhyming, and often even his \nconversation was in rhyme.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was seven, Isaac wrote an acrostic poem on his name that \nreflected the image he had of himself. It began: \"I am a vile \npolluted lump of earth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThough he had a beautiful soul, apparently Isaac Watts was not an \nattractive man. He was frail and often sickly. His head seemed too \nlarge for his five-foot tall body; his small, piercing eyes and \nhooked nose did not enhance his appearance any.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing his formal education, Watts spent five years as a tutor. \nDuring those years he began to devote himself more diligently than \nbefore to the study of the Scriptures. One of his first hymns of the \nmore than 600 he wrote was: \"When I Survey The Wondrous Cross.\" It is \na hymn that was first published in 1707 and garnered the following \npraise from Charles Wesley: \"I would give up all his other hymns to \nhave written this one.\"\u0014",

    "words": "May 10, 602 \u0014\n\u0014\nIrish Abbot Comgall\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that everyone has heard of St. Patrick, the missionary who \nmore than anyone else was responsible for converting Ireland to \nChristianity. But there is another founder of great importance to the \nIslands whose feast is observed on this day, May 10. St. Comgall \nfounded Irish monasticism. As a consequence, he was indirectly \nresponsible for the conversion of much of Europe to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nComgall's most famous monastery was Bangor, founded about 552. This \nis where Columba studied--the Columba (or Columbanus) who became a \nrenowned missionary. Unlike Patrick, who was born in Britain, Comgall \nwas Irish-born. After serving in the military, he studied under St. \nFinnian and St. Ciaran, then joined with some friends in living a \nstrict monastic life on an island in Ulster. They were so harsh on \nthemselves that seven of them died of cold.\u0014\n\u0014\nComgall wanted to leave Ireland, but his bishop talked him into \nstaying. And so Comgall became an apostle of monasticism in his \nhomeland. By his death, about 3,000 monks were under his authority. \nHe wrote their rule, of which this is thought to be a scrap of it: \n\"This is the most important part of the rule; Love Christ; hate \nwealth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBangor was a severe place. Comgall himself ate only once a day. And \nyet he urged his monks to maintain close friendships, saying, \"A man \nwithout a soul-friend is a body without a head.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMiracles are claimed for Comgall. For example, it is said he once \nhealed a blind man by smearing saliva on his eyes. Another time, he \ncaused blindness to fall on some thieves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who sat at his feet was St. Gall, who later conducted \nmission work in Switzerland. Indeed, it was Irish monks who carried \nthe gospel to Britain and the Continent during the sixth and seventh \ncenturies. They also preserved much of the lore of the west, so that \nthey saved precious knowledge during the barbarian invasions. We have \nComgall to thank for this.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter terrible suffering, the Irish monk died May 11, probably in \n602, at the Bangor monastery he had founded, first receiving the \nbread and wine of Christ's body and blood one last time.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCahill, Thomas.

    "words": "May 30, 1416 \u0014\n\u0014\nInto the Fire Went Jerome of Prague\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many respects, the life of Jerome of Prague paralleled that of his \nteacher and friend Jan Hus. Hus welcomed the writings of Wycliffe to \nBohemia. There he preached reformation a century before Luther. \nJerome was also convinced of the Wycliffian truths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Hus's suggestion Jerome sailed to England and studied at Oxford, \nWycliffe's old seat of learning. For the next several years, Jerome \nmoved about a good deal, spreading reform doctrines in Paris, \nJerusalem, Heidelberg, Vienna, Russia, Lithuania, Hungary and \nCologne. In his native Bohemia he sided with nationalistic students. \nHe denounced a bull proclaiming an indulgence for a crusade against \nNaples.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Hus was arrested by the Council of Constance, Jerome secretly \nfollowed, hoping to defend his friend. He discovered he could do \nnothing but was in great danger himself, and so he went to \nneighboring Idelberg and asked for safe conduct. Unwilling to do \nnothing, he had placards posted throughout Constance saying he was \nwilling to appear before the bishops, that his character had been \nmaligned, and that he would retract any error which could be proven \nagainst him. All he asked was a pledge of security.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen no pledge was forthcoming, Jerome headed home. On the way he was \nseized and sent in irons to the Council. A long chain was attached to \nthe irons, and by this he was dragged into the cloister to be \ninsulted, and then locked in a tower. His legs were fastened in \nstocks. For many days he was kept in this miserable condition. After \nHus was burned, Jerome was threatened with torments if he would not \nrecant. In a moment of weakness, he yielded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his recantation, he was not released. On the contrary, a \nsecond recantation was demanded. He said he would recant only in \npublic. By then he had been a prisoner almost a year. At the public \n\"recantation,\" he took back his earlier recantation and demanded a \nhearing to plead his cause. The Council refused this plea. \nIndignantly he protested, \"To my enemies you have allowed the fullest \nscope of accusation: to me you deny the least opportunity of defense. \n. . .\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJerome insisted he protested only against the bad behavior of the \nclergy. Unlike Hus he did not reject the doctrine of \ntransubstantiation. Nonetheless, he was condemned to die in the \nflames as Hus had. For two days the council kept him in suspense, \nhoping to frighten him into a recantation. The Cardinal of Florence \npersonally reasoned with him. Jerome remained steadfast. When a cap \nwas made for him painted with red devils, he said, \"Our Lord Jesus \nChrist, when he suffered death for me, a most miserable sinner, did \nwear a crown of thorns upon his head; and I for his sake will wear \nthis adorning of derision and blasphemy. He sang hymns on his way to \nexecution. Because of his vigor and health he was a long time dying \nin the flames. On  May 30, 1416, he and his paper crown were burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFoxe, John. The New Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Rewritten and updated by \nHarold J. Chadwick.

    "title": "IF YOU HAVEN'T FAILED YET, BE PATIENT, YOU WILL",
    "words": "Whens The Last Time You Embraced Failure? \u0014\nBill Wilson\u0014\n June 17, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nFailure. \u0014\nJust saying the word in the same sentence as our name makes us \nnervous.\u0014\nFar too often, failure and ministry go together. Frequently, failure \nis the last word for ministers and churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany ministers inner lives are marked by a sense of failure. Some \neventually walk away from the ministry feeling like a failure.\u0014\n\u0014\nScores of laity walk away from a local congregation with a cloud of \nfailure and disappointment hanging over them. Life in a congregation \nbecomes a series of disappointments an\u0014\nd frustrations.\u0014\nWhat is it about life in the local church that seems so prone to \nfailure?\u0014\nFor some, failure is the result of unrealistic expectations. We think \nwe are better than we are, or we think that our church is better than \nit is.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes, our failures are the results of our poor choices. We sell \nour soul for a bowl of temporal pleasure and reap the consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers have too small a God and constantly underachieve as a result \nof not aiming high enough.\u0014\nFailure comes to us in a myriad of ways. Sadly, the church of the \n21st century often shoots its wounded and treats failure as the \nunpardonable sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nHealthy churches and healthy clergy must cultivate a theology of \nfailure. Many years ago, I heard Stephen Shoemaker use that phrase to \ndescribe a biblical truth that many of us overlook.\u0014\nBiblical and church history is clear: God is in the business of \nredeeming failure and using it to accomplish the work of the kingdom. \nFrom character studies of nearly everyone in the Bible who does \nsomething noteworthy to innumerable saints across the ages who \ndisappointed God and themselves, our gospel story makes clear that \nGod specializes in taking people and groups that are broken and \nmaking them whole again.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn that spirit, we must consciously choose to transform failure, or \nelse there will be no place for any of us. Could it be that we are \nall wounded healers who can find in our failures and wounds the \ngenesis of our most valuable gifts?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, our failures have consequences. Clergy who betray the \ntrust of their calling, their ordination and their congregation may \nno longer be fit to serve in that role. Others who fail may need to \nfind a new way to use their gifts for the kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, before we cast aside all those who are less than perfect, we \nwould be wise to heed the biblical story and teachings about failure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe drama of the last weekend of Jesus' life is bracketed by two \nstories of profound failure.\u0014\nThe first is Judas. Preferring an earthly revolution, he attempts to \nforce Jesus' hand and conspires to maneuver him into the role of \nrevolutionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis failure to comprehend the deeper nature of the revolution that \nJesus brings produces profound sorrow and eventually leads to his \nself-destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second notable failure of Passion Week is Peter. Confronted with \nhis friendship with Jesus, he denies knowing the Galilean, and \nrenounces the one to whom he had only hours earlier promised loyalty.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a monumental failure could have easily led Peter to the same \nfate as Judas. Instead, his failure becomes the catalyst for his \ngreatest achievements for the risen Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne disciple allows his failure to define him; the other disciple \nallows his failure to transform him.\u0014\nWhich will it be for you?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is not whether you or your congregation will experience \nfailure. All of us are deeply flawed and imperfect vessels. As a \npastor, I regularly reminded my congregations that if I had not \ndisappointed them yet, they should be patient, for I would do so soon.\u0014\n\u0014\nFailure is inevitable. The question will be what you allow your \nfailure to mean for you. Will it be the last word, or will it be the \nbeginning of a new and deeper season in your life or the life of your \ncongregation?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if we committed to building a church culture that anticipated \nand allowed for failure? What if we emulated Jesus and forgave those \nwho disappointed us and extended grace to those who failed to meet \nour expectations? What if we treated others with the same generosity \nwe would hope for should our roles be reversed?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen such a thing happens, the Bible shows that amazing stories of \nredemption and new life are possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHealthy churches and ministers are well acquainted with failure, and \nlearn to lean into it and emerge more like the person or the \ncongregation God intends them to be.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

Instead, what we say about God has much \nmore to say about us than about God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most common name that God gives Godself in the Torah is \"YHVH,\" a \nname that is sometimes thought to be so holy that no one was allowed \nto pronounce it. But that's not exactly right -- it's not that \"YHVH\" \nwas not allowed to be pronounced, it's that it is literally \nunpronounceable, since it consists of four Hebrew vowels (yod, hay, \nvav and hay). By the way, that's also why some people incorrectly \ncall this name \"Yahweh,\" since (as Rabbi Lawrence Kushner once said), \nif you tried to pronounce a name that was all vowels, you'd risk \nserious respiratory injury.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even more importantly, the name YHVH is actually a conflation of \nall the tenses of the Hebrew verb \"to be.\" God's name could be seen \nas \"was-is-will be,\" so God isn't something you can't capture or name \n-- God is only something you can experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Geoffrey A.

    "words": "In the Games of the Rich, the Poor Lose \u0014\n\u0014\nVinoth Ramachandra\u0014\nMonday, June 27, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is once again in the news, with \nits dire warnings about Greece's debt and the U.S. deficit slowing \ndown global economic growth. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis tedious obsession with \"growth\" and fiscal management, while all \nother considerations  such as the nature of that growth, who bears \nthe cost of that growth (e.g., deaths by pollution, climate change or \nrising food prices), and how the benefits of that growth are \ndistributed  recede from public view, only confirms Joseph \nStiglitz's quip that the IMF is staffed by third-rate economists from \nfirst-rate universities.\u0014\ndrops from 4 percent to 2 percent or China's from 9 percent to 5 \npercent, how does that portend global economic disaster?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd why is the fate of banks and creditors of greater concern than \nthe fate of the majority poor of the world?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is refreshing to turn from these insanities to Susan George's \nlatest book, \"Whose Crisis, Whose Future? Towards a Greener, Fairer, \nRicher World\" (Cambridge: Polity, 2010).\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge has been a tireless campaigner on behalf of the world's poor, \nand she puts many of us to shame by her life-long perseverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her latest book, she repeats something she said in her first book, \n\"How the Other Half Dies,\" way back in 1976, in a chapter called \n\"What Can I Do?\". Let me quote from that:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Study the rich and powerful, not the poor and powerless ... Any good \nwork done on peasants' organizations, small farmer resistance to \noppression or workers in agribusiness can invariably be used against \nthem. One of France's best anthropologists found his work on \nIndochina being avidly read by the Green Berets  Meanwhile, not \nnearly enough work is being done on those who hold the power and pull \nthe strings. As their tactics become more subtle and their public \npronouncements more guarded, the need for better spade-work becomes \ncrucial  Let the poor study themselves. They already know what is \nwrong with their lives and if you truly want to help them, the best \nyou can do is to give them a clearer idea of how their oppressors are \nworking now and can be expected to work in the future.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe continues: \"We still lack sufficient knowledge of those who make \nthe decisions that affect countless lives and are in a position to \nmanipulate the rules to suit themselves  that is, transnational \ncorporations and banks, international financial institutions, global \nand regional trade bodies, right-wing think tanks and cultural \ninstitutions, major state bureaucracies, the media, and so on.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, over the decade 1998-2008, the financial services \nindustry in the U.S., which includes banking, securities, insurance \nand accounting firms, spent $5,000 million  yes, $5 billion  on \nlobbying politicians to do away with inconvenient bits of legislation \n(such as the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which Franklin Roosevelt \ninstigated to separate commercial banks from investment houses like \nMerrill Lynch).\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 2007, the financial industry employed 2,996 people to do nothing \nbut lobby politicians.\u0014\n\u0014\nA report titled \"Sold Out: How Wall Street and Washington Betrayed \nAmerica\" describes in detail 12 deregulatory measures that financial \nindustry lobbyists were able to push through Congress with the \nenthusiastic cooperation of the legislators.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the regulating agencies were being paid handsomely by the banks \nwhose products they were asked to assess. It's hard not to call this \ncorruption. In any other country, it would.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the U.S., since it's all legal, we don't equate the U.S. with, \nsay, Mugabe's Zimbabwe.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did the financial services wrecking crew get in exchange for \ntheir $5 billion in lobbying and political contributions?\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were allowed to create and trade financial derivative products, \nsubject to no regulation whatsoever. Trillions of dollars were \nsubsequently bet on these exotic products.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commodities markets were also stripped of regulation through the \nCommodities Markets Modernization Act, allowing unbridled speculation \nand contributing heavily to food riots in more than 30 countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever the lobbyists or legislators set out to eliminate a useful \nlaw, they called it \"modernization\" or \"reform.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have been intimidated for far too long by the pseudo-scientific \npronouncements of economists and the lies of politicians. Banking is \nnot so complex that we cannot understand how we are being conned.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere are the Christians in economics and finance who dare to think \n\"outside the box\" and write the kind of books that Susan George \nwrites, explaining to \"ordinary\" folk how not to be hoodwinked by the \ngames the rich play?\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is George's apt summing up of the reigning economic orthodoxy \nthat is playing havoc with God's earth and human lives:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Every cultivated field must produce a maximum without fallow or \nrest; every worker must be infinitely flexible; every factory must \nproduce at lowest cost or perish; every bank must out-risk its \nrivals. Hundreds of millions are excluded because they are 'not \nproductive enough' or 'cost too much.' Hundreds of millions more \nproduce and consume so little that they serve little or no purpose in \na capitalist marketplace. They are dispensable or worse; their \nperceived uselessness is nothing but another drag on the system. As \nfar as the rich are concerned, so long as they accept to do so \nquietly, they can rot. If they protest, they will be dealt with. The \nrich can do without them. Our societies are stretched financially, \neconomically, socially, ecologically to the breaking point and we \nhave no shock absorbers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nVinoth Ramachandra is secretary for dialogue and social engagement \nfor the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students.

    "title": "IS THE CHURCH DYING OR JUST SOME DENOMINATIONS?",
    "words": "A few years ago I interviewed Dallas Willard about the state of the \nchurch. The wide-ranging conversation touched on the lack of \ndiscipleship, the insecurity of ministry leaders, the churchs \ninfatuation with business values, and the inadequacy of our \nseminaries. Finally I asked Dr. Willard, Are you ever discouraged by \nall of this?\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not discouraged, he quickly replied, because I believe that \nChrist is in charge of his church, with all of its warts, and moles, \nand hairs. He knows what he is doing and he is marching on.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis answer caught me by surprise. Im embarrassed to admit that \nbecause it reveals my lack of faith. Of course Dr. Willard is \nabsolutely right. Christ is in charge of his church and he knows what \nhe is doing. I think we get ourselves into trouble when we fail to \ndistinguish his Church from the numerous 501c3 organizations we call \nchurches. \u0014\n\u0014\nRecent numbers I saw indicate that about 50 churches are closing ever \nweek, church attendance is not keeping pace with population growth, \nand the average age of church members is going up. These facts, like \nthe ones reported by the SBC last week, are what make us think the \nchurch is dying. And the truth is some churches are dying and others \nreached room temperature years ago. But that doesnt mean the Church \nis dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy time in Cape Town, South Africa, last October made that abundantly \nclear. I was attending the Third Lausanne Congress on World \nEvangelization with about 4,000 other delegates from over 200 \ncountries. The evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, show the \nglobal church is more than surviving...its thriving! Some of the \ngrowth may be attributed to strategic planning on the part of Western \nchurches and missions agencies in the early 20th century. But what we \nheard again and again were the unexpected and even miraculous ways in \nwhich the church has been planted, germinated, fed, and nurtured. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is my point? Im not saying we should put our heads in the sand \nand ignore the grim realities that face many churches and \ndenominations in the West. We have been called to do our work in the \ngarden of the Lord (1 Corinthians 3:5-15), and we will be judged for \nthe faithfulness of our labor. But we must remember that the \noutcomes, the growth and fruit, belong to Christ and not us. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd holding firmly to this truth, we should not succumb to the doom \nand despair that seem to be worn with pride by many young church \nleaders these days. The truth is that some, even many, local and \nregional expressions of the church may well decline and die. But \nChrist is ever at work cultivating life out of death. Ultimately his \nChurch will be just fine. So, while many both inside and outside the \nfamily of God take some perverse pleasure in declaring The church is \ndead, we can with full faith and confidence shout in response, Long \nlive the Church!\u0014\n\u0014\nSkye Jethani (@skye_jethani) is senior editor of Leadership Journal, \nOut of Ur, and Catalyst Leadership.\u0014",

    "title": "INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION FOR TODAY'S WORLD",
    "words": "A lot of people are arguing about the meaning and the use of the \nConstitution of the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the new Congress began, a group of Republicans decided to read \nan edited version (one that didn't include the part about slaves \nbeing three-fifths of a person).\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are those we might call \"strict constructionists\" or \n\"originalists\" who demand that we read it and apply it exactly as it \nwas understood in 1788.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since 1788. Although \nwe celebrate the birth of the nation on July 4, 1776, we didn't \nreally become a nation until 1788 when the Constitution replaced the \nArticles of Confederation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore that, we were a loose \"confederation\" not much different from \nthe European Union. The Constitution changed all of that.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the \"strict constructionists\" have been arguing of late that \nthe purpose of the \\Constitution was to limit the federal government. \nAs Richard Stengel writes in an excellent and timely article in Time, \nthis isn't exactly true:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nor are we in danger of flipping the Constitution on its head, as \nsome of the Tea Party faithful contend. Their view of the founding \ndocuments was pretty well summarized by Texas Congressman Ron Paul \nback in 2008: 'The Constitution was written explicitly for one \npurpose  to restrain the federal government.' Well, not exactly. In \nfact, the framers did the precise opposite. They strengthened the \ncenter and weakened the states. The states had extraordinary power \nunder the Articles of Confederation. Most of them had their own \nnavies and their own currencies. The truth is the Constitution \nmassively strengthened the central government of the U.S. for the \nsimple reason that it established one where none had existed before.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, if the founders had wanted a really limited, decentralized \ngovernment, they could have stayed with the Articles of \nConfederation, but that didn't work, so they created a federal \ngovernment.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it does limit some powers, and it makes sure that authority is \nshared between legislative, judicial and executive branches, but as \nStengel notes, the Constitution actually strengthens the center and \nweakens the authority of the states.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have argued before, and I will argue again, that the \"strict \nconstructionist\" line is a lot like the \"literalist\" reading of \nScripture. It allows for no interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the text of the Constitution (like Scripture) is to speak to us \ntoday, it has to be interpreted in light of the world in which we \nlive now.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Stengel notes, the founders knew nothing about health insurance or \npredator drones, so how can a strict reading apply to such things?\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, if this wonderful document, which is neither inerrant nor \ninfallible, is to have any value for our day, then we must allow it \nto be read, interpreted and applied with a degree of flexibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr, to paraphrase Jesus: The Constitution was made for human beings, \nnot human beings made for the Constitution. It is a human document \nand needs to be read as such.\u0014\n\u0014\nI really doubt that if James Madison were alive today, he would want \nus to read and apply it in the same way as in the late18th century. \nWith that in mind, let us have a vigorous conversation about the \npurpose of this document.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Cornwall is pastor of Central Woodward Christian Church \n(Disciples of Christ) in Troy, Mich.\u0014",

    "title": "ISAAC WATTS' BIRTHDAY SERMON",
    "words": "July 17, 1698 \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac Watts' Birthday Sermon\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the annals of hymn writing, Isaac Watts shines as a leading \nluminary. In most Reformation countries, hymns were employed in \nworship but seldom in the English church before Watts was born. \nAnglicans sang the Psalms. Psalm singing, which had at first been a \nwelcome innovation, become a dreary, unmelodious chanting. Each line \nwas first read out by a clerk and then sung. Through Isaac Watts' \ninfluence, that changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts was born in Southampton, England on this day July 17, 1674. He \nfell under conviction in 1688 and learned to trust Christ in a \npersonal way a year later. No doubt his father's influence was felt \nhere, for his father was twice imprisoned for refusing to bend to the \nChurch of England beliefs. Later Isaac refused to take an \nall-expenses-paid education rather than conform himself to the Church \nof England. After attaining his education under more difficult \ncircumstances, Watts became a preacher. He gave his first sermon on \nthis day, his birthday, July 17, 1698, at Mark Lane in London. His \nqualities were such that the church soon named him its assistant \npastor. Shortly afterward he became seriously ill and suffered such \npoor health the remainder of his life that he was often unable to \ncarry out his church duties.\u0014\n\u0014\nA kindly friend, Sir Thomas Abney took him under his roof and there \nhe lived thirty years. The church also showed much wisdom and charity \nin continuing to support him despite his fevers and neuralgia. A lady \nwho fell in love with him from reading his hymns is said to have \nrejected him close up upon finding him small and far from handsome.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his lack of beauty, Watts wrote inspiring poems which were \nattractive to worshippers. Scarcely a hymnbook today in the English \nspeaking nations is without one or more of his hymns. Psalm singing \nhad fallen into a sad state and church leaders were seriously \nquestioning what to do. Watts boldly called for a new kind of psalm, \nrewritten in light of the New Testament gospel. \"We preach the gospel \nand pray in Christ's name, and then check [stifle] the aroused \ndevotions of Christians by giving out a song of the old dispensation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nActing on his own word, he published a collection of Christianized \npsalms in 1719. Even before this, in 1707, he published his Hymns and \nSpiritual Songs. They include \"Joy to the World.\" These, not his \nsermons, are his true gift to the church and inspired Charles \nWesley's even more successful endeavors.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatts faced fierce opposition. Many church leaders were opposed to \nhis efforts and some called his hymns \"Watt's Whims.\" The common \npeople, however, delighted in them. Eventually the Church of England \nrevised its stand and began adding hymns to their worship. His most \nfamous songs point to Christ:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I survey the wondrous cross\u0014\non which the Prince of glory died, \u0014\nmy richest gain I count but loss, \u0014\nand pour contempt on all my pride.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nBenson, Louis F.

    "title": "IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES",
    "words": "Genesis 45:1-15\u0014\n\u0014\nThe passage before us is a beautiful and powerful story of \nreconciliation. Yet, precisely because it is so powerful, it raises \nsignificant issues about why one chooses reconciliation over \ngrudge-bearing in the first place. We all know of (and most probably \nhave been a party to) situations in which individuals refuse to \nextend forgiveness to their offender. Perhaps the hurt is too new or \ntoo deep. Perhaps holding on to anger seems more satisfying or more \nsecure than the thought of allowing the anger to dissipate. Perhaps \none's unforgivingness is one's way of ultimately getting even. \nWhatever the dynamic, harboring ill will continues to be a \nwell-franchised cottage industry. All of which brings us back to the \ntext with the question, \"Why was Joseph so willing to forgive?\" What \nfactors motivated this reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers?\u0014\n\u0014\nLet's not forget that Joseph had no need to forgive his brothers in \nthe sense that they held some obligation over him. His was a position \nof strength and power; he had the upper hand. Usually we imagine that \nit is the weaker party that comes first to the table of forgiveness, \nbecause they lack something that only the stronger party can provide. \nLet's also remember that Joseph was the one wronged. Again, we \nusually expect the wrongdoer to take the initiative in reconciliation \nand not the victim. So what is going on in this text?\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to suggest that today's lesson offers an anatomy of \nreconciliation and forgiveness. First, reconciliation occurs only \nwhen the pain of estrangement outweighs the pleasure of revenge. \nJoseph could no longer control himself (v. 1); he wept so loudly that \nthe Egyptians heard it (v. 2). What we see here is Joseph's inability \nto contain the pain he felt over the separation from his brothers -- \na cry of the soul that echoed through the chambers of time. Revenge \nis a powerful emotion and one that is not easily relinquished. But \nthere comes that moment in the midst of estrangement when revenge \nloosens its grip on the heart and the pain of separation rushes in to \nfill the void. That moment may be brief and it may come only rarely, \nbut when it does the opportunity for reconciliation is made possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, reconciliation occurs only when the pull of love is stronger \nthan the push of indifference. Joseph asked, \"Is my father still \nalive?\" (v. 3). The antithesis of love is not hate, but indifference. \nReconciliation cannot take place when one does not care -- either for \nright relationships or for the alienated party. Nothing is so \ncancerous to the emotions as unconcern. Indifference hardens the \narteries of compassion and will eventually lead to heart failure. \nLove is ultimately stronger than indifference, but love will not \nenter the system without being invited. First Corinthians reminds us \nthat love is not self-intrusive or pushy. Therefore, if love is to \nlead to reconciliation -- if its attraction is to overcome the \nrepelling force of indifference -- then one must make room in the \nheart for love to do its work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, reconciliation occurs only when the misdeed becomes a part of \na larger canvas. The narrow and self-centered actions of the brothers \ntake on a different coloration when set within the framework of God's \nbroader and family-centered intentions. To be sure, it is \nextraordinarily difficult to look beyond the boundaries of individual \ninjury in order to recognize the horizons of God's transformative \npurposes, but unless one is willing to reframe one's perspective, \nreconciliation cannot occur.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, reconciliation occurs only when silence gives way to \nconversation. \"And after that his brothers talked with him\" (v. 15). \nOne can understand how in the initial shock waves of estrangement, \nany meaningful conversation can be nigh unto impossible. Yet, it is a \nlaw of physics that shock waves lose their potency the further away \nfrom the epicenter they move. It is equally a law of reconciliation \nthat the further one moves from the initial hurt the less potent the \nwaves of retribution. Unless -- unless one works at re-emitting the \nwaves of hurt by a constant revisiting of the wound, which in turn \ncreates a pain-induced silence. On the other hand, if one allows the \nwaves of estrangement to work its natural dissipation, then space is \ncreated for the reverberative sounds of conversation. And it is when \nthe estranged begin to talk with one another that the deafening \nsilence gives way to the music of reconciliation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue that this text raises, however, is how difficult it is to \nreconcile with those who are closest to you. This is true for a \nnumber of reasons -- among them is that those who are closest to us \noftentimes cause the deepest hurt, and that when dealing with family \nand friends pride has a way of raising its head in a way that it does \nnot with those who are less close to us. Joseph seems not to have \nnear the difficulty of forgiving those who were responsible for his \nimprisonment as he did in forgiving his brothers. But the hard truth \nis that unless we can forgive those closest to us then reconciliation \nwill remain an ideal and not a reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nSCHUYLER RHODES, Emphasis Magazine\u0014",

    "title": "IS TRUMP OUR CYRUS? A CASE FOR YES OR NO",
    "words": "Is Trump Our Cyrus? The Old Testament Case for Yes and No \u0014\nChristians eagerness to understand Gods will in real time can cause \nthem to overlook fundamental biblical and divine principles.\u0014\nDANIEL BLOCK| OCTOBER 29, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin Netanyahu wasnt the first to compare Donald Trump to the \nancient Persian leader, Cyrus. But hes probably been the most \nprominent. Following the 45th presidents announcement earlier this \nyear that the US embassy in Israel would move from Tel Aviv to \nJerusalem, the Israeli Prime Minister remarked, I want to tell you \nthat the Jewish people have a long memory, so we remember the \nproclamation of the great king, Cyrus the Great, Persian king 2,500 \nyears ago. He proclaimed that the Jewish exiles in Babylon could come \nback and rebuild our Temple in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nNetanyahus suggestion that Trump may be compared to Cyrus because of \nhis specific policies affecting the Jewish community gives his \nanalogy a unique twist. But American evangelicals have compared Trump \nto the Persian ruler since the Republican primaries. (This claim even \nmade an appearance in the recently released film, TheTrump Prophecy.) \nThey argue that just as Cyrus, scarcely a devotee of YHWH the God of \nIsrael, served as Gods agent by authorizing Jewish exiles in Babylon \nto return to the Promised Land and to rebuild the temple to YHWH, so \nthe narcissistic and morally flawed Trump can advance the causes of \nthe evangelical communityand by extension, the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Cyrus?\u0014\n\u0014\nCyrus the Great was the sixth-century B.C. emperor who made Persia \ngreatindeed the greatest empire in history to that pointby taking \nover and expanding the empire of the Babylonians. Cyrus plays a \ncritical role in the Bibles story of YHWHs relationship with his \npeople Israel. All of YHWHs covenant promises seem to have been \ndashed in 586 B.C., when Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian armies \nconquered Jerusalem, burned the temple of YHWH to the ground, and \ndecimated what had remained of the Judean population after the \ndeportation of the upper crust to Babylon in 598 B.C. (2 Kings \n24:1016). According to Ezra 1:14, in fulfillment of Jeremiahs \nprophecy (Jer. 29:114), shortly after Cyrus assumed the rule of \nBabylon, the Persian king issued a decree authorizing the Judean \nexiles to return home and to rebuild the Temple of YHWHwith the aid \nof resources he provided.\u0014\nA vital extra-biblical source of our knowledge of Cyrus, especially \nfor the perspective it provides for Cyruss decree in Ezra 1, is a \nclay cylinder the size of a large wine bottle discovered in the ruins \nof ancient Babylon. The Cyrus Cylinder Inscription was produced after \nthe Persian conquest of the city in 539 B.C. Written as government \npropaganda, the text lauds King Cyrus for his achievements, including \nhis policy of permitting people whom his predecessors had brought to \nBabylon as captives to return to their homes to rebuild the temples \nfor their respective gods. The following excerpt describes the \nBabylonians reaction to Cyrus when he arrived in their city:\u0014\nHe (Marduk, the chief Babylonian god) ordered him to march to his \ncity Babylon. He set him on the road to Babylon and like a companion \nand a friend, he went at his side. . . . He made him enter his city \nBabylon without fighting or battle; he saved Babylon from hardship. \nHe delivered Nabonidus, the king who did not revere him, into his \nhands. All the people of Babylon, all the land of Sumer and Akkad, \nprinces and governors, bowed to him and kissed his feet. They \nrejoiced at his kingship and their faces shone. Ruler by whose aid \nthe dead were revived and who had all been redeemed from hardship and \ndifficulty, they greeted him with gladness and praised his name \n(translation by M. Cogan, in The Context of Scripture 2: Monumental \nInscriptions [2000], p. 315).\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first glance, these sentences seem to conjure an image quite \nforeign to our 21st-century political scene. And, to be sure, the \nidea of the rise of a pagan monarch in the First Testament \nparalleling the rise of a democratically elected president may seem \nsurprising. However, there are several striking links between the \nBabylonians reception to the rise of Cyrus and the American \npresidential campaign and election in 2016.\u0014\nFirst, in both situations, an outsider rose to the supreme political \nposition in the state. Cyrus was a Persian and a foreigner to \nBabylonian politics. A career businessman and entertainer, Trumps \nrise involved eliminating a series of establishment Republican \ncandidates before defeating the establishment Democratic candidate.\u0014\nSecond, although we do not know how Jewish exiles in Babylon felt \nabout Cyrus when he first arrived, the grassroots citizenry greeted \nboth Trump and King Cyrus enthusiastically. The cylinder identifies \nCyruss supporters as all the people and the black-headed \npeoplean epithet for the native population at large and a contrast \nto the ruling class. Similarly, Trumps base has been described as \npopulist, a contrast to the cultural urban establishment.\u0014\nFinally, popular support for the newcomer arose from perceived abuse \npeople suffered at the hands of the previous leaders and their \ndisregard for traditional values. Cyruss inscription speaks of the \nBabylonian King Nabonidus neglecting the worship of the citys divine \npatron, Marduk, and his imposition of forced labor upon the citys \ninhabitants, ruining them all. Other texts portray Nabonidus as \ndevoted primarily to Sin, the moon god. As for the Jewish population \nin Babylon, encouraged by Cyruss magnanimity and stirred by the \nSpirit of YHWH, they enthusiastically prepared for the long journey \nhome. Remarkably, through the foreign king Cyruss decree, YHWH was \nfulfilling his ancient promise.\u0014\nPresident Trumps campaign targeted evangelicals, many of whom had \nfelt marginalized during his predecessors eight years in office. In \nhis two terms, Barack Obama alienated many conservative Christians \nwhen he stopped enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, came out in \nsupport of gay marriage (and shockingly lit up the White House with \nrainbow colors after the Supreme Courts affirmation of marriage \nequality), and, through the Department of Health and Human Services \nmandate, compelled people opposed to certain forms of birth control \nbecause of their faith commitments to provide it to their employees.\u0014\nLike orthodox Yahwists under Jeroboam I, the first ruler of \nsecessionist Northern Israel (cf. 2 Chron. 11:1317), American \nevangelicals felt squeezed out by the previous syncretistic \nadministration. By 2016, more than 40 percent of evangelicals said \nthat in recent years it had become more difficult to be an \nevangelical Christianup seven percentage points since 2014.\u0014\nConsequently, many Christians were willing to overlook Trumps \nracially insensitive remarks and sexist comments and egotistical \nbehavior, because he agreed that their convictions had been violated \nand offered hope that some of these violations could be overturned. \nDuring the Republican primary, Trump told hundreds of evangelical \nleaders, The government has gotten so involved in your religion. \nEspecially your religion, that it makes it very difficult. Trumps \nrhetoric recalls Cyruss promise to restore the proper worship of \nMarduk and to liberate the citizenry from the exploitation and abuse \nthey had previously suffered.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut although these parallels are impressive, concluding that Trump \nimitates Cyrus ignores key differences in their stories. For \nstarters, Trump is not a conquering emperor. He has not inherited \nwhat was once the land of Israel as part of his empire, the Jewish \npopulation of the world are not his subjects by virtue of his \nconquest of another nation, and he has not authorized the \nreconstruction of the temple in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore importantly, regardless of the way leaders are chosen, \nChristians believe that the hidden hand of God is operative behind \neach transition in leadership (1 Sam. 2:68; Ezek. 17:24; Dan. 2:21, \n4:17; John 19:11; Rom. 13:17). However, the purpose behind the \ndivine operation is often unknown until long after the event. The \nHebrew Scriptures recognize the unique role of Cyrus in the \npreservation of Gods people and ultimately his place in the divine \nplan of redemption (Ezra 1:111.) But we have no contemporary \nprophets like Isaiah (cf. Isa. 41:24, 44:2445:7) or historians like \nthe author of Ezra 1:14, who could have, under divine inspiration, \npredicted the emergence of President Trump as the key agent in the \ndivine plan or, after his emergence, declared with prophetic \ncertainty that he was Gods man for the hour. Nevertheless, within \nweeks of the presidential election, some American pastors were using \nbiblical texts about Cyrus to declare confidently that President \nTrumps election was Gods answer for a nation off course. (Whats \nmore: Such pontifications are easier when our candidate wins, but \none wonders what such leaders might have said had Hillary Clinton \nwon.)\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/Is Trump Our Cyrus\u0014",

    "words": "Illegal to Deny the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nSuppose the U.S. Congress passed a law making it illegal to deny the \nBible as the Word of God? Today, the Supreme Court would quickly rule \nthat such a law is unconstitutional because it violates religious \nfreedom guaranteed by the First Amendment of the American \nConstitution. But did you know that on this day, November 4, l646, \nthe little Massachusetts Bay Colony passed just such a law?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the Puritans, who founded the colony, and for John Cotton, one of \ntheir most prominent preacher-leaders, it made sense for them to have \na theocratic (God-directed) government in which the laws ruling \nsociety were also the laws of God as found in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the Puritans did not strictly combine church and state. They \nrecognized that church and state had different purposes--one was for \nthe salvation of souls; the other was for the preservation of society \nthrough justice. Both, however, had their source in God, and both \nshould look to the Bible as the source for standards, direction, and \nguidance. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Puritans used the Geneva Bible translation. Its preface \nsummarized what the Bible meant by calling it the \"light to our path, \nthe key to the kingdom of heaven, our comfort in affliction, our \nshield and sword against Satan, the source of all wisdom, the food \nfor our souls, and the glass in which we see God's face.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the Puritans, it was unthinkable that the teachings of the Bible \nwere meant to deal only with a narrow religious sphere. They believed \nthe Scriptures provided the rule and guidance for all of \nlife--government, economics, education, church, family, and morals. \nAnd so, on this day, November 4, 1646 the Massachusetts Puritans \npassed a law prohibiting their people from denying that the Bible is \nthe Word of God. The penalty for persistence in this error was death. \nThe same act also set a fine of five shillings for failing to attend \nchurch on Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nMead, Sidney E. \"John Cotton\" in Encyclopedia of American Biography. \nEdited by John A.

    "title": "ISAIAH 9:2-7 -- ITS ORIGINAL MEANING",
    "words": "The original setting of this passage is the geo- \u0014\npolitics of the ancient world in the eighth cen- \u0014\ntury BCE. To understand Isaiah 9:2-7, we need \u0014\nto pull back the camera and view this passage in \u0014\nits larger literary context. In Isaiah 7, we meet \u0014\nKing Ahaz of Judah, who was between a rock \u0014\nand a hard place. The \"rock,\" in this case, was \u0014\nAssyria, a major Mesopotamian military power \u0014\nintent on dominating the region. The \"hard \u0014\nplace\" was an anti-Assyrian coalition forged \u0014\nbetween King Rezin of Syria (Aram) and King \u0014\nPekah of Israel (Ephraim), leaders of two small \u0014\nand weaker nations who considered that their \u0014\nonly defense against the Assyrian powerhouse \u0014\nwas to combine forces in a military alliance. \u0014\nRezin and Pekah wanted Ahaz to join in, but \u0014\nwhen Ahaz hesitated, the two kings decided \u0014\nthat a regime change was in order and attacked \u0014\nJudah, intending to depose Ahaz and to replace \u0014\nhim with a compliant partner.\u0014\n \u0014\nAhaz now had two problems: the elephant \u0014\nof Assyria, who could roll over any moment \u0014\nand crush Judah, and the Syria-Israel coalition, \u0014\nwhich already had boots on the ground headed \u0014\ntoward Jerusalem. What should Ahaz do? Snug- \u0014\ngle up to Assyria, or roll the dice and join hands \u0014\nwith Syria and Israel, thus rattling Assyria's cage? \u0014\nIn this anxious moment of political calcu- \u0014\nlation, God sent the prophet Isaiah to inter- \u0014\ncept Ahaz as he walked out on one of the local \u0014\nJerusalem roads (7:3ff.). God put a message in \u0014\nIsaiah's mouth for the king, essentially, \"Do not \u0014\nbe afraid, Ahaz. Sure, the soldiers of Rezin and \u0014\nPekah are on their way to Jerusalem, but this is \u0014\nno threat. These two little 'smoldering stumps' \u0014\naren't in charge of Judah; I am. I have made \u0014\npromises to Jerusalem and to God's people, and \u0014\nI will keep them. Stand firm in your faith.\" \u0014\nThen Isaiah added, \"If you doubt God's \u0014\npromise, ask God for a sign. Make it as big as you \u0014\nneed. As high as heaven or as deep as the under- \u0014\nworld. Just ask.\" As if Ahaz did not already have \u0014\nenough problems, he now had one more: God. \u0014\nWhat if Ahaz asked for some really big sign, and \u0014\nGod gave it? Then what? Ahaz would have to \u0014\ndecide whether to trust God in the rough-and- \u0014\ntumble world of politics or to trust his own wits \u0014\nand finesse. Trusting God was perhaps all right \u0014\nfor priests and prophets and little people, but \u0014\nkings had to stand on firmer realities; so Ahaz \u0014\ntried to wriggle free by answering Isaiah with \u0014\nfake piety: \"Oh no, I would never put God to \u0014\nthe test.\" \u0014\nIsaiah responded sharply, \"You tiresome \u0014\nidiot! OK, you won't ask for a sign, but God will \u0014\ngive you one anyway!\" What was this sign that \u0014\nwas higher than heaven and deeper than the \u0014\ndeepest pit? A baby. \"Look,\" said the prophet, \u0014\n\"a young woman is with child, shall bear a son, \u0014\nand shall name him Immanuel.\" In a world bris- \u0014\ntling with power and armies on the march with \u0014\nswords at the ready, the sign of God's promise \u0014\nof peace is that most fragile and vulnerable of \u0014\nhuman realities, a pregnant woman and her \u0014\nsoon-to-be-born child. \u0014\n\u0014\nRolling forward to our passage, this prom- \u0014\nised child has now been born, and, as promised, \u0014\nthe child is indeed Immanuel, \"God with Us.\" \u0014\nHistorically, Isaiah 9:2-7, describing a newborn \u0014\nwho would become the \"prince of peace,\" may \u0014\nhave begun as a royal coronation hymn or, more \u0014\nlikely, as a poetic birth announcement for a \u0014\nnew prince; but here in Isaiah these words have \u0014\nalready begun their migration into something \u0014\nbroader, a joyous proclamation of God's endur- \u0014\ning intention to save God's people in distress. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe passage opens with a contrast between \u0014\ndarkness and light (9:2). At one level, this dark- \u0014\nness is the gloom of a nation in turmoil. King \u0014\nAhaz turned his back on the God of life and the \u0014\nhope that only God can give (God was \"hiding \u0014\nhis face\" in 8: 17). Panicked about security, food, \u0014\nand the economy, the people see only misery \u0014\nall around them (8:20-22). For wisdom, they \u0014\ndesperately reach out to false prophets-to nec- \u0014\nromancers or, perhaps for us, to pollsters, blath- \u0014\nering pundits, and talk-show hosts (8: 19)-but \u0014\nthe darkness descends all around them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt another level, though, this darkness is \u0014\nlarger than one moment in history. Darkness \u0014\nrepresents the power of death and the disease, \u0014\ndestruction, and decay threatening God's good \u0014\ncreation. This power has shown up in the reign \u0014\nof Ahaz, but it keeps showing up-whenever \u0014\nmilitary aggression is chosen over peace, when- \u0014\never illness destroys hope, whenever fear over- \u0014\ncomes faith, whenever death loudly boasts of \u0014\nanother victim. The good news proclaimed by \u0014\nIsaiah is that God will not abandon God's peo- \u0014\nple to the darkness; God is at work to overcome \u0014\ndeath and to bring wisdom, peace, justice, and \u0014\nrighteousness, in ways as hidden and seemingly \u0014\nas weak as a newborn child. In the darkness, a \u0014\nlight has shined. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo images describe the newfound joy of the \u0014\npeople (8:3). First, the people rejoice as they do \u0014\nat harvest time. Barren fields now burst forth \u0014\nwith new life. Second, the people celebrate like \u0014\nvictorious soldiers dividing plunder-a harsh, \u0014\nmilitaristic image, perhaps, but remember, the \u0014\nplundered enemy is death. Every child of God \u0014\nthat death has claimed, every hope that death \u0014\nhas dashed, is redeemed by the power of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah 9:4-5 is rhythmic, even dance-like \u0014\n(indeed, some commentators argue this is the \u0014\nliturgy for a performed victory ritual). One by \u0014\none, the symbols of oppression-the rods, the \u0014\nboots of the enemy, the bloody uniforms-are \u0014\nbrought forward and tossed on a fire, burn- \u0014\ning up the tools of evil. Finally, the promised \u0014\nchild is pictured as a grown-up and majestic \u0014\nking. The language is Davidic, but it transcends \u0014\nany earthly king, even David. The child will \u0014\nbe strong and authoritative, bringing wisdom, \u0014\npower, and endless peace. He will rule with \u0014\njustice and righteousness because \"the LORD of \u0014\nhosts\" is zealous to uphold him (9:7). \u0014\n\u0014\n-- Thomas Long\u0014",

Investigations \nand news reports of fatwas invoking violence against women led human \nrights organizations to submit petitions to the court, which then \ntook action.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the practice is still used in Bangladesh, particularly in rural \nvillages, and not always documented. The first reported case of fatwa \nsince the ruling occurred last November when 40-year-old Sufia Begum \nwas brutally caned for an alleged affair. Although doctors suggested \nshe be taken to another hospital that could better tend to her, her \nfamily claimed they could not afford to move her. Begum died in \nDecember from her injuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nViolence against women, such as sexual assault, is a global problem; \nApril marks Sexual Assault Awareness Month in the U.S. Bangladesh is \njust one country where the problem is spelled out on the \ninternational scene. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn January 31, 14-year-old Hena Akhter died after a fatwa ordered her \nto receive 101 lashes. Her crime was that she allegedly had an affair \nwith a married man; her family says the man, a 40-year-old cousin, \nraped her. The cousin was sentenced to 201 lashes, which he did not \nundertake\u0014\n.\u0014\nBangladeshi authorities condemned Akhters fatwa, which occurred over \n50 miles away from the capital, Dhaka. This is against the rules of \nIslam, said Haji Abdul Wahab Bepari, chairman of the Naria \nsub-district. We dont have these strict Shariah laws in our \ncountry. The villagers should have stopped this.\u0014\nAuthorities were further outraged when it appeared that the fatwa was \ndeliberately hidden. Police officers have been investigated for their \nreport; now, four doctors are facing charges of hiding the cause of \nAkhters death. Their autopsy report ruled that it was a suicide and \nthere were no injuries. A second autopsy was ordered by the court, \nwhich found severe injuries on the body and claimed the girl had bled \nto death. Justice Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik of the High Court said, \nWe are appalled to see the magnitude of illegality. Other justices \nsimilarly decried the doctors actions and their audacity to \nfabricate the suicide story.\u0014\nBangladesh professes to be a moderate Muslim-majority country (of its \npopulation of 160 million people, almost 90 percent falls in this \ncategory). But it faces the difficult task of changing cultural \nmentality, as well as enforcing punishment against those who carry \nout fatwas. Chowdhury called for the ministry of religious affairs to \ncease funding for the mosques and madrassas (Muslim schools) that \norder fatwas.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs that enough? Akhters case brings up another problem: the response \nto sexual assault. Nicholas Kristof blogged, Lets hope that the \npublic reaction and punishments are so strong that the word goes out \nto all of Bangladeshs villages that such misogynist fatwas are not \nonly immoral but also illegal. And that the crime lies not in being \nraped, but in raping. \u0014\n\u0014\nAkhters father said, The thing that happened to my daughter, the \nkind of justice she received, it should not happen to anyone else. It \nmust stop.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002, the World Health Organization released a report on violence \nand health. On sexual violence, the report collected data from the \npolice, nongovernment organizations, clinics, and survey research, \nbut states: The relationship between these sources and the global \nmagnitude of the problem of sexual violence may be viewed as \ncorresponding to an iceberg floating in water. . . . The small \nvisible tip represents cases reported to police. . . . But beneath \nthe surface remains a substantial although unquantified component of \nthe problem. It also acknowledges that sexual violence has been a \nneglected area of research. The available data are scanty and \nfragmented. The report warns that cultural differences may affect \nthe data too, as some places were not willing to divulge information.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the RAVE website (Religion and Violence e-Learning), the late Dr. \nCatherine Clark Kroeger wrote, It is impossible to know the \nprevalence of abuse in a particular congregation because it is so \ncarefully concealed. The Christian Coalition Against Domestic Abuse \nstates: Sadly, religion is NOT a deterrent . . . there is just as \nmuch abuse (spousal, child and sexual abuse) in Christian homes as in \nnon-Christian homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBegum and Akhters deaths are tragic and unnecessary. Offering \ninternational attention towards their stories is a step forward in \nrecognizing and responding to the significant but overlooked issue of \nviolence against women. Do their stories prompt you to make a change \nin your mindset, your community? What can we learn from these events \nto apply to our own Christian faith?\u0014",

    "words": "North Carolinas Problem Isnt Florence, Its Poverty\u0014\n\u0014\nThe floodplains read like maps of inequality and race\u0014\nGwen Frisbie-Fulton   Baptst News Global     Sep 14, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the storm, I called Alyeesha?a friend of a friend. Shed \nstayed at my house a few years ago when she was escaping a bad \nrelationship. She lives Down East, back in her hometown in Carteret \nCounty, North Carolina, in a small one-room house that was her \ngrandmothers sharecropping cabin. She rents the cabin from the man \nwho now owns the land; it is not hers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve been there once. She had a mattress on the floor, a sofa from a \nRent-a-Center, and a picture of her grandmother on the wall. I wanted \nto let her know that if she was evacuating from the hurricane, there \nwas a sofa waiting for her here.\u0014\n\u0014\nNaw, Im going to ride it out, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone I know Down East and on the shore is riding it out. For a \nfew its bravado, but for most of them, its just that they cant go. \nThere arent enough seats in the car, or the car is busted, or \ntheres no car at all. There are too many babies or too many old \nfolks. There are jobs that wont be there for them if they miss a few \ndays. There are paychecks that havent yet cleared. There are food \nstamps that ran out last week. And there isnt enough money in \nanyones damn bank account.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, you know, we all love a good hurricane. We fetishize storms. We \nare glued to our televisions and we are refreshing our screens. We \ntalk about the wind speed, we marvel at the tattered piers. Its \nalmost like we want it. Truth is, I think Alyeesha and all my friends \nare going to be just fine during this storm. After all, as terrifying \nas it is, we know its not Florence that wreaks havoc on North \nCarolina. Its everything that comes after the storm, and everything \nthat came before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hurricane is the drama, the excitement we need. We gather bottled \nwater, toilet paper, snacks. Its something we can do, something we \ncan prepare for. We like the idea of bracing ourselves against the \nwind. We feel enraptured, intoxicated, instinctual, alive. Our lives \ncan be so mundane. So we watch, we watch, we watch. We gorge on \nhurricanes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe look away from the flood we know is coming. The slow seep of water \ndown from the mountains, spreading out of its riverbed path, breaking \nout of creeks and cricks, rushing off the pavement of cities and \nheading Down East. The water swallows up crops and homes and pigs. We \nknow this slow seep is not just water, but poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe try not to speak of it. The smeared red clay on living room walls. \nStalled out Buicks getting their last rust. Somebodys work tools \nsinking into the river. Humid air plastering an old Myrtle Beach \nt-shirt onto a body as it shovels filthy toys into trash bags. It is \nmud and muck and poverty. And we know its coming. Its all very \npredictable. So we look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty has always been a flood and not a hurricane. Its always been \na slow, rolling disaster, with muddy gray water under an incongruent \nbright blue sky. Its always been a slow build of mold between \ngenerations, of people making do with babies in faded red milk crates \nfloated on mattresses down city streets. Look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is slow. Its a looming light bill and a long wait on child \nsupport. Its the uncomfortable plastic chairs at DSS and the \ncaseworkers who dont make eye contact. Its the 10 months of \npregnancy with no insurance and lying to the doctor about the cramps \nbecause you cant afford a referral. Its the long wait in jail \nbecause you cant afford bail and long Christmas days when you cant \nafford presents. Its the long nights with the heat out and the long \ncalls trying to reach the landlord. Its the hours in detention after \nyour own boss at the meat processing plant calls immigration on you \nand the long stare you give him while he hires your cousin for less \nmoney under the table. Sometimes poverty is even the long last \nminutes trying to get through the locked door at the Hamlet Chicken \nPlant. So we look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is predictable. Its the predictability of underfunded \nschools and outdated textbooks. Its the predictability of an entire \ntwo generations of fathers and mothers being locked up and their \nleft-behind children staring cold-eyed and speaking tight-lipped \nduring the Pledge at school. Its the predictability of legislators \nturning their heads and hog waste and coal ash breaching their \nlevies. Its the predictability that after the storm we will arrest \nthe looters who spent their last dollars on gas when prices surged by \n50 cents before the storm. The predictability of all this makes us \nlook like fools, like fortysomething men wanting twentysomething \nwives. And we are embarrassed by it all. We will look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe already know where the flood waters will go. They will follow a \nslow, predictable path. We know who lives in low lying areas, we know \nwhat neighborhoods are on the south side of the tracks. From \nAppalachia down, every town has Hillers and Creekers. Floodplains \nread like maps of the economy and race.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlyeesha has the grit to make it through the storm, but after the \nwinds pass and the bottled water gets loaded back up, she knows that \nthe countrys attention will just move on. Jim Cantore does not come \nfor poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlyeeshas little house may be flooded out. She may lose everything. \nThere is no insurance company to call. Her landlord may just tell her \nhe cant do nothing, just move along. Her friend who drives her to \nwork may not be able to pick her up, and she may lose her job. She \nwill be left standing in the still waters of America, brown water on \nher brown legs, on land that was not her grandmothers and is not \nhers, with no place but my sofa to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats the predictable slow drip of poverty. All your life youve \nwatched the water rise, knowing no one is coming to get you. After \nall, they told you to get out.\u0014",

    "title": "IRS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES SATANIC TEMPLE AS A CHURCH",
    "words": "\u0014\nGood news for those who worship Satan and Satan-adjacent deities \n(goats, I wanna say?): the Satanic Temple has officially been granted \ntax-exempt status by the IRS, according to a post from the religions \nofficial Instagram account.\u0014\nBeing granted tax-exempt status essentially means that the Satanic \nTemple has the same legal protections that other religions do, \nincluding access to public spaces as other religious organizations; \naffirming its standing in court when battling religious \ndiscrimination; and enabling The Satanic Temple to apply for \nfaith-based government grants, according to a press release sent to \nRolling Stone.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\ninRead invented by Teads\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Satanic Temple had previously rejected pursuing \ntax-exempt status, church president Lucien Greaves reversed this \nstance in 2017 after President Trump signed a religious freedom \nexecutive order. As the religious are increasingly gaining ground \nas a privileged class, we must ensure that this privilege is \navailable to all, and that superstition doesnt gain exclusive rights \nover non-theistic religions or non-belief, Greaves wrote in the \nSatanic Temple newsletter (yes, apparently there is a Satanic Temple \nnewsletter), adding that the group should move to ensure that \natheistic and secular non-profits, advancing a distinct religious \nopinion and/or opinion upon religion, are themselves rightful \nbeneficiaries of religious tax exemption as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe IRS Officially Recognizes the Satanic Temple as a Church \u0014\nThe church has been granted tax-exempt status\u0014\nBy EJ Dickson    Rolling Stone\u0014\n\u0014\nAs documented by the recent film Hail, Satan?, the Satanic Temple was \ninitially founded in 2013 as something of a joke, as a way to \nhighlight the increasingly blurred lines between church and state.

    "title": "INSIDE JESUS' JUDAISM",
    "words": "Matthias Henze, Rice University\u0014\n\u0014\nA period of biblical history that is sometimes \u0014\nreferred to as \"intertestamental,\" since it covers the period after \u0014\nmost of the Old Testament was written and before most of the \u0014\nNew Testament was written. Scholars often use another term, \u0014\n\"Second Temple Judaism,\" to designate the Judaism that flour- \u0014\nished in this period - after the rebuilding of the temple in 516 \u0014\nBCE until the destruction of the temple in 70 CEO. How would you \u0014\ncharacterize Second Temple Judaism? \u0014\n\u0014\nA number of things occurred during these roughly 600 years \u0014\nthat changed Israel forever. It may not be an overstatement to \u0014\nsay that Jesus and the early Jesus movement would have been \u0014\ninconceivable without the dramatic changes and transforma- \u0014\ntions that took place in Second Temple Judaism. \u0014\n\u0014\nSix events stand out for me. First, the monarchy came to an \u0014\nend. During the Second Temple period, Israel was no longer \u0014\nruled by kings, as it was during the First Temple period. At the \u0014\nsame time, prophecy also ended, as many prophets were close- \u0014\nly aligned with the monarchy. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the second temple in Jerusalem never had the same \u0014\nsignificance as the first temple, and it certainly never enjoyed \u0014\nthe same theological, unifying authority. To the contrary, more \u0014\nand more groups distanced themselves from the Jerusalem \u0014\ntemple, most famously, perhaps, the group that left us the Dead \u0014\nSea Scrolls: they preferred a life in the Judean desert in self- \u0014\nimposed exile. \u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the Second Temple period saw the emergence of the \u0014\nDiaspora as a permanent reality in Judaism. In the Old Testa- \u0014\nment, the books of Esther and' Daniel are set in the Diaspora. \u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, and perhaps the most defining attribute of Second \u0014\nTemple Judaism: its ever-increasing, internal divisions and the \u0014\ndramatic fragmentation of Judaism into smaller groups. The \u0014\nfirst-century CE historian Josephus tells us that there were \u0014\nthree main groups: the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the \u0014\nEssenes. We now know that there were many more than three \u0014\ngroups. Initially, the followers of Jesus formed one such early \u0014\nJewish group. It wasn't until centuries later that Christianity \u0014\nclearly became a distinct religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, the word of God ceased to be exclusively oral and in- \u0014\ncreasingly became a written text. The writing down of God's mes- \u0014\nsage ultimately led to the emergence of the first biblical canons. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd sixth, the Second Temple period was a time of unprece- \u0014\ndented intellectual creativity, theological exploration, and liter-\u0014\nary productivity. A wealth of new texts were written, only a few \u0014\nof which found their way into our Bibles. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish writings produced in the centuries just before \u0014\nJesus-books like First Enoch or Jubilees-are little known by \u0014\nChristians. Does that matter? \u0014\n\u0014\nIf Christians want to understand Jesus and those who first \u0014\nwrote about him, we need to have at least a rudimentary \u0014\nknowledge of Jesus' Judaism. If we don't understand early \u0014\nJudaism, how can we understand Jesus and his message? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe main challenge here is that the Judaism of Jesus is not \u0014\nthe religion in the Old Testament.In other words, the Old \u0014\nTestament cannot explain the Judaism of Jesus. The reason for \u0014\nthis is chronological: the books of the Old Testament were writ- \u0014\nten hundreds of years prior to the time of Jesus, they stem from \u0014\na different era, and they reflect a different stage in the religion \u0014\nof Israel. It IS a bit like wanting to explain the United States \u0014\ntoday by pointing to the US Constitution. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to learn about the Judaism of Jesus, we need to turn \u0014\nto Jewish texts that are closer in date to the time of Jesus. This \u0014\nis where texts such as First Enoch, Jubilees and Fourth Ezra\u0014\nbecome invaluable: they help us fill in the chronological gap \u0014\nthat exists between the Old and the New Testament and inform \u0014\nus about the Judaism of Jesus.\u0014",

    "title": "IRENAEUS OF LYON",
    "words": "Irenaeus of Lyon \u0014\nPassionate Apologist to the Gnostics\u0014\nJune 2019  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nIn A.D. 177, the people of Lyon (the capital of Gaul, todays France) \nwent after the citys Christians. It had been a trying time for the \npeople of Southern Gaul, who had been suffering from frequent enemy \nraids and a deadly plague. To those who hadnt embraced Christ, the \nChristians refusal to worship pagan deities was a credible \nexplanation to the gods fury. Long existing prejudices escalated \ninto a full-scale riot. Residents assaulted Christians, dragging them \nto the public square. City authorities evaded responsibility, instead \nthrowing Christians in prison and submitting the matter to the \ngovernor.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Christians were condemned for repudiating the \nauthorities demands. Some were cruelly executed in a public arena, \nwhile others, like Pothinus, the bishop of Lyon, died in prison. In \nthe wake of this nightmare, Irenaeus, who was likely traveling when \nthe tragedy occurred, returned to pick up the pieces. As Pothinuss \nsuccessor, he was faced with all the questions of a tragic aftermath: \nhow to care for widows and orphans, console the suffering, encourage \nthe defectors, relieve fears, and promote unity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Missionary to Gaul\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time Irenaeus moved to Gaul, Christianity was growing rapidly. \nHistorians estimate that, by the end of the first century, the \nChristians in the Roman Empire were fewer than 10,000. By A.D. 150, \nthey had grown to about 40,000, and by the end of the second century, \nthey were more than 200,000. They were mostly spread around the \nMediterranean Sea, but some of them ventured beyond the boundaries of \nthe empire. The persecution was sporadic, mostly instigated by the \ncommon people.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Christians were organized in churches and united by common \nbeliefs, which were expressed in short official statements known as \nRule of Faith (an early form of the Apostles Creed). Their customs \nand traditions, however, were very different and changed from place \nto place. No one knows for sure how long the Christian communities \nhad been in Gaul when Irenaeus arrived there. It appears that they \nwere already there around the middle of the second centurymostly \nimmigrants from Asia Minor.\u0014\n\u0014\nVery little is known about Irenaeuss life. Even the year of his \nbirth has been disputed. He might have been born around A.D. 130 or \n140 in todays Turkey, where he studied (specifically in Smyrna, \ntodays Izmir) under Bishop Polycarp. As a direct disciple of the \napostle John, Polycarp echoed Johns warnings against false teachers. \nLater in life, Irenaeus still remembered Polycarps cry, O good God, \nfor what times hast Thou reserved me, that I should endure these \nthings?\u0014\nGnosticism\u0014\n\u0014\nGnosticism (from the word gnosis, meaning knowledge) is a term of \nconvenience used by later historians. The various tendencies under \nthis umbrella had one thing in common: a desire for higher knowledge. \nAs such, they were already mentioned in New Testament warnings by \nPaul (especially in the Epistle to the Colossians), John (in his \nfirst epistle), and Jude.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost likely, Irenaeus encountered Gnostics when he traveled to Rome, \nwhich at that time had a population of over a million people from all \nover the known world. He was particularly acquainted with a group \nknown as Valentinians, who were part of the widespread phenomena we \ntoday refer to as Gnosticism. Irenaeus took time to study Gnostic \nwritings and to talk to Gnostics in person. His conclusions, however, \nwere firm and unequivocal: These people were wolves in sheeps \nclothing, and their statements were absurd and inconsistent with the \ntruth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the encouragement of a friend, Irenaeus wrote his reflections in a \nseries of five books, which he titled The Refutation and Overthrowal \nof Knowledge Falsely So-Called (today known as Against Heresies), a \nproject he continued for a number of years, between A.D. 175 and 189.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe might have started writing before moving to southeastern Gaul, \nwhere he served as presbyter (or bishop, since the two words were \nused interchangeably). He mostly operated in Vienne and Lyon, two \ncities about 20 miles from each other. It was a prosperous region, \nparticularly important as a center of trade and Celtic religious \nrites. Every year, Lyon hosted a meeting of the 60 tribes from the \narea and a popular festival in honor of the sun god Lugh (equivalent \nof the Roman Mercury).\u0014\n\u0014\nBringing Truth to a Persecuted Church\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was just before this festival, in 177, that the Lyonnaise attacked \nthe Christians. Irenaeus was probably in Rome, where he had been sent \nto carry a letter to Bishop Eleutherius and discuss the controversial \nteachings of Montanus in Asia Minor. The authors of the letter \ncommended Irenaeus as being zealous for the covenant of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he returned, the questions facing Irenaeus were urgent and \ncomplex. While the faith of some survivors had been strengthened \nthrough the persecution, many others were wearied by the struggle. \nThe taunts of their fellow citizens questioning where their God was \nwere still fresh.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the threat of violence from those who still followed \ntraditional Roman beliefs, Irenaeus had to address heresy within the \nchurch. In the wake of the tragedy, the temptation to Christians to \nfall into the Gnostics teachings was great. Gnosticism, in its \nvarious forms, had encouraged people to look for higher knowledge and \na more sophisticated understanding of Christian belief than what the \napostles and the local churches could offer. While adherents \norganized themselves in separate communities, they often gained a \nhearing within the churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gnostic message had a wide appeal. First of all, the prospect of \nobtaining a higher, secret knowledge is always tempting. Second, \nGnosticism provided a plausible explanation of the problem of evil as \nthe result of the impulsive and vindictive whims of an inferior god, \nand this struggle between two deities made sense. Third, the \nGnostics contempt for the material world allowed many of them to \nconsider pagan ceremonies inconsequential. They could in good \nconscience accept the demands of the Roman government and escape \npersecution. In addition, their message sounded biblical enough to \nattract those who didnt have time to submit their claims to serious \nexamination.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Irenaeus, the main problem with Gnosticism was that it was not \nhistorical Christianity. The Gnostics were not interested in the \nhistorical Jesus and didnt see the Bible as a unified story of \nredemption. To them, salvation was obtained through enlightenment and \nwas only available to a chosen few. Their writings were earnest and \npoetic but quite different in scope and spirit from the canonical \ngospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the biblical narrative was not important to them, they could \ncast doubts on some of the basic tenets of the Christian faith. For \nexample, some taught that the man on the cross was not the same as \nthe miracle-working Christ, because it was not fit for Christ to \nsuffer. This was problematic on both soteriological and practical \nlevels. To persecuted Christians, it would have raised the question \nof why Christ asked his followers to accept abuses to the point of \ndeath when he himself escaped all suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides, while most Gnostics were sincerely convinced of possessing \nthe truth, a few used the appeal of higher knowledge as a means of \nexploitation. A Gnostic named Marcus was especially crafty around \nLyon, performing tricks with water and wine to mimic Christs \nmiracles and amaze his followers. He targeted wealthy women, urging \nthem to give messages from God by saying the first thing that came \ninto their minds. When they did, he proclaimed them prophetesses, \naccepting their valuable gifts and sexual favors as tokens of their \ngratitude. Only a few women recognized the deception and returned to \nthe church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese and many other pressing problems made Irenaeuss work against \nthe Gnostics particularly pastoral. He hoped to help not only those \nwho were attracted by their message but the Gnostics themselves, \nbecause he loved them better than they seem to love themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnswering the Gnostics\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gnostics teachings were not an easy study. Unlike the apostles \nwritings, which the Gnostics scorned as overly simple, these included \ncomplicated explanations. Some believed that the world was created by \na dual god who emitted another single or dual being, forming a unit \nthat generated a succession of Aeons or spiritual beings or powers \nwho performed different functions in the universe. Some Gnostics gave \npersonal, subjective names to these beings, often revealed through an \nelaborated code of numbers or letters.\u0014\n\u0014\nNavigating and explaining the multiple variations of this system was \nenough to weary the toughest mind. Erasmus of Rotterdam, who \npublished the first printed edition of Against Heresies in 1526, \ncommented that Irenaeus had a patientis stomachi to digest their \ndoctrines. Irenaeus would have agreed, as he ended his survey with \nthe typical cries of Greek tragedies, Iu, Iu! Pheu, Pheu!\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus used satire to highlight the incongruities he found in the \nGnostics universe. If the names of these Aeons were arbitrary, why \nnot call one of them Gourd and his coexisting power Utter Emptiness? \nThis Gourd and Emptiness, since they are one, produced (and yet did \nnot simply produce, so as to be apart from themselves) a fruit, \neverywhere visible, eatable, and delicious, which fruit-language \ncalls a Cucumber, Irenaeus mocked. Along with this Cucumber exists \na power of the same essence, which again I call a Melon.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeuss main responses came from logic and Scriptures. He employed \nlogic to point out that two contrasting gods, being inevitably \nimperfect and limited, can hardly be called gods. His abundant use of \nScriptures (629 citations from both the Old Testament and 1,065 from \nthe New) is impressive and unique among second-century writers, who \nrelied largely on logic oras in the case of Justin Martyron \nprimarily Old Testament writings. It was for Irenaeus a careful and \ndeliberate choice, in order to confirm the apostolic truth the \nGnostics refuted. His inclusion of New Testament Scriptures is \nparticularly useful to historians as a proof that many of the books \nthat compose this part of the Bible were already authoritative at \nthat time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Unity of Scriptures\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeuss desire to answer the Gnostic contrast between a capricious \nand malevolent creator of an evil and defected world and the good and \nloving God of the New Testament produced a most vigorous and lucid \nexplanation of the unity of Scriptures, culminating in the doctrine \nwe call recapitulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus reminds his readers of the biblical narrative, where there \nis only one God, who is perfect, omnipotent, uncreated, and the only \nsource of every good thing. This God created the world good and has \ncontinued to preserve it through history in spite of the rebellion of \nthe first Adam. In the fullness of time, God sent his only son as a \nsecond Adam to take on human flesh (the same flesh the Gnostics \ndespised) and accomplish what the first Adam failed to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis reminder was also important on a soteriological level. By \nrejecting anything physical, the Gnostics denied Christs incarnation \nand his effective work of salvation, reducing him to the role of an \nenlightened being sent to open the eyes of spiritual men to a secret \nknowledge. Also, by picking and choosing Scriptures, they obscured \nthe unity of the biblical story of salvation through Jesus Christ, \nwho came [so that], taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as \nconstituting Himself Head of the Church, He might draw all things to \nHimself at the proper time.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Passionate Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout Irenaeuss writings, its clear that his doctrines are not \nsterile notions. He writes enthusiastically and passionately, \ncommunicating his excitement for the beauty of Gods person, truth, \nand works, which include the created world and the gospel. His heart \nsoars as he challenges the Gnostics to come even slightly close to \nGods incomparable creation: What heavens have they established? \nWhat earth have they founded? What stars have they called into \nexistence? Or what lights of heaven have they caused to shine? Within \nwhat circles, moreover, have they confined them? Or, what rains, or \nfrosts, or snows, each suited to the season, and to every special \nclimate, have they brought upon the earth?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis excitement over who God is and what he has done in Christ \nstands, for Irenaeus, as the basis of the Christians way of lifea \nlife that is marked by grateful obedience, love, and exuberance. The \nmotivation has changed. Christian giving, for example, is made, not \nby slaves, but by freemen. Irenaeus saw martyrdom as the culmination \nof the Christian path and a chance to demonstrate what he considered \nthe highest form of love: love for our enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeuss Relevance\u0014\n\u0014\nSome believe that Irenaeus died as a martyr in 202 or 203, during the \npersecution unleashed by Emperor Septimius Severus. There is no solid \nproof of this. Jerome mentions it in his commentary on Isaiah, \nwritten in 410, but not in his 392 biographical work De Viris \nIllustribus. In any case, the last writing we have from Irenaeus is \nfrom 190, so the date, if not the mode of Irenaeuss death, might be \nfairly accurate.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis legacy, however, lived on. From a purely historical point of \nview, Against Heresies is still considered the best analysis of \nGnosticism from an eyewitness.\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus, whose work many argue paved the way for the Protestant \nReformation, identified so strongly with the theologians passion for \nbiblical truth that he called him my Irenaeus. Erasmus lamented \nthat Irenaeuss priscum vigorem (early vigor) was sorely absent in \nthe 16th-century church, together with the bishops love for peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name Irenaeus means, in fact, peacemaker, and the \nsecond-century bishop had several occasions to live up to his name. \nOne of these occurred in A.D. 190, when Irenaeus encouraged Victor, \nbishop of Rome, to accept the different dating of Easter used by the \nChristians from Asia Minor who lived in Rome, instead of \nexcommunicating them as Victor had threatened to do. As strict as \nIrenaeus was in matters of essential doctrine, he stood for tolerance \nin minor issues.\u0014\nErasmus might have referred to this occasion when, at the end of his \nintroduction to his edition of Against Heresies, he prayed God would \nraise some new Irenaei to bring peace to his troubled times. His \nprayer is still as relevant today.\u0014\nSimonetta Carr is the author of the award-winning series Christian \nBiographies for Young Readers\u0014",

    "words": "I.B. Kimbrough and the Highwaymen\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIaac Barton (I. B.) Kimbrough was one of those many tough19th-century \npastors who appeared on the United States frontier. Bornin Tennessee \nin 1826, he was orphaned at seven and acquired littleeducation. When \nhe married in 1846, having just turned 21, he couldscarcely read. \nThree years later he was converted to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately he set out to master reading, so that he could study the \nBible and theology. He had a family to maintain, so he made a frame \nonhis plow on which to prop a book as he worked. At night, he studied \nbycandle or at the fire side.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe upshot was that he became something of a homespun \nChristianscholar, evangelist and Baptist pastor in his native \nTennessee. Heconverted and baptized over 1,000 people and organized \neight newchurches. Built like a football linebacker, possessing a \nstrong voice,and definite in his aims, he commanded considerable \nattention.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Tennessee Baptists appointed him to raise money for Carson \nandNewman College, Kimbrough, who was already 50 years old, went to \nworkwith a will, and became known as \"the beggar\" because he pleaded \nsoassiduously for funds. A fascinating episode shows him as the \nultimatesalesman.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pair of highwaymen pulled a gun on him and ordered him to handover \nhis money. According to Kimbrough, who told the tale at the \nTexasState Convention on this day, June 26, 1886,he asked for a \nlittle time to comply, got off his horse, pulled out themoney and \nlaid it in two distinct piles, one of them quite small. Hethen told \nthe robbers that the little pile was his. They could takethat. But \nthe larger pile was the Lord's, and he dared them to touchthat. \"I \ncollected it for the young preachers of the state who arestruggling \nfor an education at Carson and Newman College.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe highwaymen questioned him. After learning he was a preacher \nandthe nature of his mission, they said they'd not touch either pile \nofmoney. Kimbrough then warned them they were in a bad line of \nbusinessand urged them to turn from it. He then asked them to donate \nsomethingto the school! Both robbers did.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years later, Kimbrough moved to Texas, where he spent \nhisremaining years in the work of Christ, founding numerous churches \ninthe less-established regions of Texas. In 1890, he was \nsimultaneouslypastor at three churches: Hale City, Plainview (where \nhe oversaw thebuilding of the first Baptist church in a 120 mile \nradius) and FloydCity. He died at Plano, Texas in 1902.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n1.Cummins, David and Thompson, E.

It wasnt that long ago \nthat I was feeling nothing but hurt and isolation and rejection. \u0014\n\u0014\nI receive a lot of messages asking me how this process has gone for \nme and how Ive come out on this side of it. Heres how: I chose to \ntake care of ME instead of serving as caretaker of someone elses \nheart and hurt. Once I made THAT decision (and its not always easy \nto decide to choose you), I moved all of my power and behaviors \nbehind that goal. I worked heavily with my own life coach; I allowed \nmyself to fully feel every emotion that came up for me (acknowledged \nit, let it do its work, and then let it pass); I worked on \nforgivenesses, apologies, and significant emotional statements. I \ndanced a lot outside in nature. \u0014\n\u0014\nI walked barefoot on the earth and asked the earth to take my pain \nfrom my body since the earth is bigger and mightier than me- she is \nfar more equipped to hold on to the big emotions. I took a job to \nkeep me busy during the hours Id get sad. I leaned heavily on what I \nlove: family, friends, reading, good Netflix, dancing, yoga, music, \nnature. I communed with women older than me who have been through \nthis and they created a safe space for me to sit broken. And thats \nwhen I woke up one day and started smiling and glowing and feeling \nGOOD again! Thats when I remembered my personal power and wholeness! \u0014\n\u0014\nSheena Jeffers\u0014",

    "title": "I WAS A VIOLENT KLANSMAN WHO DESERVED TO DIE",
    "words": "I Was a Violent Klansman Who Deserved to Die \u0014\nYet at the height of my segregationist fervor, God showed me mercy.\u0014\nTHOMAS TARRANTS| AUGUST 19, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nI came of age in the early 1960s, when America was entering a period \nof political, social, and cultural upheaval. Mobile, Alabama, where I \nwas raised, had been segregated since its founding in 1702. In 1963, \nreacting to the federally mandated desegregation of Alabamas public \nschools, Gov. George Wallace uttered his infamous pledge of \nSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever. Many \nwhite Alabamians, including me, were fearful and angry. White society \nwas in turmoil from top to bottom, and the sense of grievance was \nstrong, adding fuel to a racist, populist wave across the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy high school was among the first to be desegregated. Like most \npeople around me, I identified with Gov. Wallaces courage in \nstanding up to those who were threatening our way of life. On a more \npersonal level, I was angry with my father, alienated from him, and \nsomewhat emotionally troubled. All these factors made me a good \ncandidate for radicalization.\u0014\n\u0014\nI read some white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-Communist \nliterature that was circulating within my high school. Then I met the \npeople who were advocating these ideas. They contended that black \npeople were inferior to whites and that desegregation, by enabling \nintermarriage, would weaken the white race. The civil rights \nmovement, they said, was part of a Communist plot, and the US \ngovernment had been infiltrated by Communist agents. Christianity and \nthe Constitution were being undermined, and a secret Jewish \nconspiracy was behind it all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll these warnings made me anxious about Americas survival, and my \nfears soon turned into angerand eventually hatredtoward those I \nperceived as Americas enemies. Their successes made me want to stand \nup and fight for God and country, as those around me were urging. \nThe more I immersed myself in this thinking, the more it felt like a \nholy causesomething that offered a sense of purpose and belonging. I \ngrew increasingly distant from my family and others who might have \npulled me back from the brink.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my view, preserving America justified using any means necessary. \nSo it was only a short step to getting involved with Mississippis \ndreaded White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the most violent \nright-wing terrorist organization in the United States at the time. \nAlthough various prosecutions had greatly weakened the Mississippi \norganization, it still had enough strength to attract me.\u0014\n\u0014\nLittle did I know that my downward spiral into extremist ideology, \nconspiracy theories, and racial and ethnic hatred would culminate in \nviolence and death. But it did. Late one sweltering summer night, as \nmy accomplice and I attempted to plant a bomb at the home of a Jewish \nbusinessman in Meridian, Mississippi, we were ambushed in a police \nstakeout. My partner, a young female school teacher, was killed at \nthe scene. Four blasts of shotgun fire at close range left me \ncritically wounded. Doctors told me it would be a miracle if I lived \nanother 45 minutes.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet God spared my lifeto the astonishment of the doctors and the \ndismay of the police. If anyone deserved to die, it was certainly me.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning to See\u0014\n\u0014\nI wish I could say I repented of my sins and came to a genuine faith \nin Jesus after God showed me mercy, but I didnt. In fact, I remained \nfirmly committed to the ideology and conspiracy thinking that gripped \nmy mind. At the end of a two-day trial, I was convicted of attempted \nbombing and sentenced to 30 years in the Mississippi State \nPenitentiary, one of the worst prisons in America at the time.\u0014\nAbout six months after arriving in prison, I escaped with two other \ninmates, intending to return to my terrorist activities. But a couple \nof days later, we were apprehended after a blazing gun-battle with \nthe authorities, during which one of the other inmates was killed. \nHad this man not relieved me from standing watch about half an hour \nearly that day, I would have been the one killed. God had shown me \nmercy once more.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in prison, I was confined to a six-by-nine-foot cell in the \nmaximum security unit. Five more years were slapped onto my sentence. \nApart from twice-weekly showers, I was utterly alone in that cell. To \nkeep from going crazy, I read continuously. Initially, I read more \nracist and anti-Semitic material that reinforced my beliefs, but \neventually I felt drawn to a disinterested pursuit of truth, wherever \nthat might lead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis began with classical philosophy and eventually led to the New \nTestament, specifically the Gospels. I didnt turn to the Bible \nbecause I wanted a better relationship with God. I had attended \nchurch and Sunday school more or less regularly until my early teens, \nat which time I made a profession of faith and was baptized. I \nbelieved I was saved and would go to heaven when I died. Of course, \nthe truth was just the opposite. I had only given intellectual assent \nto the gospel and lacked true repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as I read the Gospels in my prison cell, my eyes were opened in a \nway that went beyond simply understanding the words on the page. As \nthe true meaning of Gods Word became clearer, so did its relevance \nto my life. I had been blind to spiritual reality all my life and was \nnow beginning to see.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs this process unfolded, my sins came to mind, one after another. \nConviction grew, and with it tears of repentance. I needed Gods \nforgiveness. And I knew it came only through trusting Jesus, who had \ngiven his life to pay for my sins. One night I knelt on the concrete \nfloor of my cell and prayed a simple prayer, confessing my sins and \nasking Jesus to forgive me, take over my life, and do whatever he \nwanted to with it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning, I awoke with a deep hunger for Scripture and a \ndesire to pray and to live for God. As I read the Bible daily, a \nwhole new world opened up to me, and I couldnt get enough! Early on, \nGod delivered me from hate, and I began to grow in love for others. \nFriendships developed with black inmates and others who were very \ndifferent from me, including the FBI agent who had orchestrated my \ninitial capture as well as the Jewish lawyer who helped him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut part of this awakening was not such welcome news. Morally, my \nlife was a messand the more I read the Bible, the more I saw it. \nSome of those changes happened quickly and without too much \ndifficulty; others took more time and struggle. Like all believers, I \nremain a work in progress, as God continues to work on my sins, \nflaws, and follies.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Pit So Deep\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter serving eight years in prison, an extraordinarysome would say \nmiraculousturn of events resulted in a parole grant to attend \nuniversity. That set in motion a series of developments which, over \nthe next 40 years, led me first into campus ministry, then pastoral \nministry in a racially mixed church (including speaking and writing \non racial reconciliation), and finally to a long ministry of \nteaching, discipling, spiritual mentoring, and writing at the C.S. \nLewis Institute.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I look back over the nearly 50 years since God saved me, I can \nonly thank and praise him that he didnt give me what I deserved. But \nbecause he is full of grace and mercy, he gave me exactly what I \nneeded. He is patient with [us], not wanting anyone to perish, but \neveryone to come to repentance (2 Pet. 3:9).\u0014\n\u0014\nI marvel at his continuing patience in my life. Truly, with God there \nis no sin too great to forgive, no bondage too hard to break, and no \npit so deep that his love isnt deeper still.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Tarrants is president emeritus of the C.S. Lewis Institute. He \nis the author of Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love: How a Violent \nKlansman Became a Champion of Racial Reconciliation (Thomas Nelson).\u0014",

He thinks there is something more exciting\u0014\nand fulfilling out there, beyond the gates of his fathers estate.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, his wanderlust gives birth to a plan. Remarkably,\u0014\nhis father goes along with the plan, which features the foolish\u0014\nyoung man collecting his share of his inheritance in advance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, with his pockets full, he waves good-bye and heads off\u0014\ninto the distance. The camera focuses in on the fathers eyes,\u0014\nwatching his son disappear over the horizon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen it is the father who looks longingly out the window\u0014\nof his home. His eyes search the distant hills for any sign of his\u0014\nson returning home. But there is nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, the son has traveled quite a distance. He is\u0014\nenjoying his freedom at an alarming rate, and his previously\u0014\nbulging wallet begins to grow thin. Soon his party is over, and\u0014\nhe needs to find employment. We watch him go from one place\u0014\nto another, seeking work, begging food. Finally, he lands a job\u0014\nthat is, for him and his people, about the most undesirable work\u0014\nto be done. Nothing can change the definition of desirable\u0014\nquite like desperation, however.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man has a job and even some food, of sorts. We\u0014\nshould slow down the film in order to trace each subtle movement. \u0014\nThe young mans eyes stare off longingly again, though\u0014\nthis time from a much gaunter face.

At the same time, the Coast Guard cutter Paulding \ntraveled across the surface. Those traveling on the two craft never \nsaw each other. The submarine broke the surface just in time to \nreceive a death blow from the Paulding. The submarine, with its crew \nof forty, sank in less than five minutes. It came to rest more than \none hundred feet below on the ocean floor.\u0014\n\u0014\nRescue attempts began at once. Due to inclement weather, it took \ntwenty-four hours for the first diver to descend to the wreckage. As \nsoon as the divers feet hit the hull, he heard tapping. Survivors \nwere trapped inside. Pounding out Morse code on the hull with a \nhammer, the diver discovered that six crewmen had survived the \ncollision. With renewed efforts, the rescue crew struggled to reach \nthese men before it was too late. Again, the weather would not \ncooperate. Every attempt failed. With their air supply dwindling, the \nsix survivors tapped out in Morse code a final haunting question, Is \nthere any hope?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe response, composed by Captain King was: \"There is hope. \nEverything possible is being done.\" But thwarted by the weather, the \nrescue force could not rescue the six men. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the best efforts of the rescue team, all 40 men aboard were \nlost. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the course of the rescue operation, Chief Gunner's Mate Thomas \nEadie rescued, at the risk of his own life, a fellow diver, Fred \nMichels, who became fouled in the wreckage while attempting to attach \nan air hose to the S-4. For his heroism Eadie was awarded the Medal \nof Honor. \u0014\n\u0014\nS-4 was finally raised on 17 March 1928, by a salvage effort \ncommanded by Captain Ernest J. King.

    "words": "Henry Blackaby tells about a widow in his church named Ivah Bates:  \n\"She was one of the greatest prayer warriors I have ever known.  Our \nchurch was the body of Christ, and we called Ivah a knee. God put her \nin the body as a powerful pray-er.\u0014\n   \"When we had new believers, I would send them over to Ivah and let \nher talk to them about how to pray.  She equipped many pray-ers.  \nWhen we began our ministry to the university campus, Ivah didn't know \nhow to function in the body concerning the campus.  Who was to equip \nher to function in the body in this new ministry?  Our campus \nminister was.  He shared with Ivah how she could pray regarding the \ncampus.  She did not change her role in the body; she just learned \nhow to be the 'knee' for the campus.  The students were told, \n'Whenever you are going to witness to somebody or you have a \nparticular assignment in our ministry, go to Ivah and tell her about \nit.  She will pray.'\u0014\n   \"So a student named Wayne said to Ivah, 'Next Tuesday I will be \nwitnessing to Doug.  Would you pray for me?'  Ivah agreed.  She \ndropped everything and began to pray over the noon hour while Wayne \nwas witnessing.  She did that every time the students told her what \nthey were doing. Only the 'hand ' was touching the campus, but the \nwhole body was fitly joined together.  Each part functioned where God \nput it, so that the hand could be effective.\u0014\n   \"About three months later, a young man came down the aisle during \nthe invitation.  He was accepting Christ.  I said to the \ncongregation, 'This is Doug.  He has just become a Christian.' I \nlooked over at Ivah; she was deeply moved and weeping. She had never \nmet Doug, but she had prayed for him for three months.\u0014\n   \"Who won Doug to the Lord?  The body did!\"\u0014\n   [Experiencing God: Knowing and Doing the Will of God by Henry \nBlackaby and Claude King.  Lifeway Press, 1990.  Page 162.]\u0014",

    "words": "David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer International tells of taking a \nstroll along the beach with his family.  Just a mile inland from \nwhere they were walking was a large airport.  As the children played \nin the sand, David noticed that there was an airplane quite a ways \nout over the water.  It seemed to be just hanging there over the \nhorizon. He could see its landing lights so he knew it was headed \ntoward the airport, but it didn't seem to be moving at all.\u0014\n\u0014\n   After a few minutes the \"stationary\" airplane began to rumble and \nDavid could see it getting bigger.  When it roared over his head, he \nfinally got a better picture of the incredible speed and power at \nwhich it had been coming directly toward him all along.  How could he \nhave ever thought it was standing still?\u0014\n\u0014\n   David sees this as an apt picture of what's happening in North \nAmerica today.  For several years now, the hope for spiritual \nawakening has been like a dot on the horizon, but now as the prayer \nmovement gathers momentum it's \"as if we can hear the roar of the \nengines as the jet looms larger.\"  Revival is at hand!\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Evangelical Advocate, Jul 1996.

    "words": "Dr. Paul Ferris remembers as a boy in 1952 how he watched in \nfascination as Elizabeth was crowned Queen of England.  Even on \nblack-and-white TV, the ceremony in Westminster Abbey was colorful.  \nOne intriguing aspect of the whole process came right before they \nplaced the crown on the new queen's head.  The Archbishop of \nCanterbury called out to the audience that was sitting north of the \ndais, \"Sirs, I present to you the undoubted Queen of this realm.  Are \nyou willing to do her homage?\" Their response was resounding.  Then \nhe turned around and faced the opposite direction and repeated the \nquestion.  Again there came a hearty affirmative response.  Only \nafter he had done the same thing in all four directions did they put \nthe crown on the head of Queen Elizabeth II.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The pomp and ceremony was indeed impressive, but that Queen, \nthough she reigns over the United Kingdom, is merely a constitutional \nmonarch. Parliament can pass whatever legislation it pleases.  She \ncan withhold her signature if she disagrees with it, but the bill \nbecomes law nonetheless.  Although she is \"the undoubted Queen of the \nrealm,\" she rules in name only.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Isn't that the way it is with lots of us in God's kingdom.  \nWithout hesitation we affirm, \"Jesus Christ is the undoubted King of \nthe realm,\" but when it comes to everyday life, we make our own \nrules.  The New Testament refers to Jesus as Lord 618 times, but we \ncontinue to organize our lives not around His lordship, but around \nhuman authority--most typically our own.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Servant, Wint 1997.
