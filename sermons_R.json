    "title": "RELIGIOUS SELF-HELP LITERATURE",
    "words": "Since there is little substance in their books-- little in the way \nof information, arguments, or new ideas--their power of persuasion is \npurely personal.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When Americans speak of religious freedom, they typically mean the \nright to worship as you please rather than the right not to worship \nat all.  In fact, it is practically un-American to not believe in \nGod.  Most popular religious literature reflects this intolerance of \nunbelief in its attitude toward nonbelievers, sometimes condemning \nthem, sometimes pitying them. Such books, especially those of the \nself-help variety, mix the sacred and the secular, attempting to use \npsychological language and techniques to instruct, inspire, or \nindoctrinate.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Authors like M. Scott Peck, James Dobson, Charles Swindoll, Gordon \nMacDonald, and David Seamands don't argue or reason with readers; \nthey smugly announce the truth, without distinguishing fact from \nopinion.  Admittedly, thousands of people are helped by their books.  \nThe persuasiveness of the writers, however, is strictly in their \npersonal appeal since the books themselves lack substance, offering \nvery little in terms of new ideas or information.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The following are some familiar common themes that emerged from a \nsampling of over 30 popular Christian books:  The world is basically \na moral ordered place.  Dependence upon God is essential. \nIndividualism is both sinful and unhealthy.  To have low self-esteem \ninsults God.  Evil is a type of personality disorder.  All that is \nrequired for salvation is faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n   With their mixture of pop psychology and religion, these messages, \nthough aimed at the conservative Christian subculture, are obviously \ninfluenced by prevalent mainstream ideas about goodness, health, and \nsocial relations.  The religious writers rationalize their use of \npsychology by saying that it has finally seen the light regarding \nsome eternal truths.  At the same time, they also devise ways to make \nthe insights of psychology more acceptable to their audience, e.g., \nequating illness with sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n   All these writers advocate submission to God as the ultimate \nauthority but overlook the recent historical evidence that \nenslavement to evil is much more likely to be associated with \nsubmissiveness than with independent thinking. Yet they tenaciously \ncling to the doctrine of original sin and criticize psychoanalysis \nfor not holding individuals responsible for their own behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Criticizing Swindoll's emphasis on grace, the writer claims that \nhe teaches there is no punishment for bad deeds and no reward for \ngood ones.  Not only is Swindoll down on religious pluralism and \nintellectualism, he discourages readers from thinking for \nthemselves.  So when he laments that fact that people don't read much \nanymore, he's like a porn dealer bemoaning the decline in morality.  \nShe implies that non- Christian women will be offended by Swindoll's \nadvocacy of traditional sex roles and accuses him of anti-Semitism \nfor suggesting that the holocaust was a consequence of the Jews' \nrejection of God. She ridicules MacDonald's penchant for organization \nand careful use of time and seems to feel his insights on dealing \nwith sin are simplistic.  She upbraids Dobson for being critical of \nfeminism and for advocating corporal punishment and \"unabashed \nauthoritarianism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Most popular religious books fail to provide a model for moral \nbehavior in the world and thus offer no basis for community.  They \nmakes list of legalistic prohibitions--abortion, atheism, and \nhomosexuality--but do little to help people resolve ethical dilemmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Saving therapy: exploring the religious self-help literature\" \nby Wendy Kaminer.

    "words": "\"Recent U.S. Presidents as a group are believed to have \npossessed just average ethical standards.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   With another Presidential election approaching, we can expect \nintense media scrutiny of candidates.  The George H. Gallup \nInternational Institute asked 1,007 adult Americans to evaluate \npresidential ethics.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When asked how they rated the ethical standards of recent \npresidents, only 4% said \"very high\" and only 13% said \"high.\"  \nForty-two percent rated them average, and almost the same percentage \nrated them low or very low.\u0014\n\u0014\n   With similar pessimism, only 13% felt recent presidents have done \na good job of raising the moral and ethical standards of the nation \nas a whole.  Most (51%) rated the presidents as fair in this area, \nand 35% said \"poor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Is the nation's moral health even an issue for presidents?  The \nquestion was asked, \"Regardless of the kind of job you think recent \npresidents have been doing, how much influence do you think they \ncould have on raising the moral and ethical standards of the \nnation?\"  The majority (54%) said presidents could have a great deal \nof influence. Another 32% answered \"some.\"  Only 12% believe \npresidents have little chance of affecting the moral climate of the \nnation.\u0014\n\u0014\n   People were asked to rate the importance of these qualities in a \npresident: high ethics, personal honesty, good family life, and \nstrong religious faith.  Personal honesty and high ethics led the \npack at 36% and 34%, respectively. Religious faith was rated highest \nby only 13% of those polled, and a good family life received 8% of \nthe votes.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Religious values are important, however.  Half those questioned \nsaid they were extremely important, and 39% said somewhat important.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Public wants presidents to be moral and ethical leaders.\"  \nEmerging Trends, May 1995 (Vol 17, No 5).

I simply remember that a span of time had to lapse \nbefore I woke up to a new reality; I am no longer a married man....I \ncan no longer derive my sense of being from my wife.

    "title": "RULES FOR NORTHERNERS COMING SOUTH",
    "words": "Rules for a Northerner moving South\u0014\n\u0014\n 1.  Save all manner of bacon grease.  You will be instructed later \nhow to use it.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2.  If you forget a Southerner's name, refer to him (or her) as \n\"Bubba\". You have a 75% chance of being right.\u0014\n\u0014\n 3.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can. \nStay home the two days of the year it snows.\u0014\n\u0014\n 4.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in \nthe cab of a four wheel drive with a 12-pack of \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein and a tow \nchain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them.  Just stay out \nof their  way.  This is what they live for.\u0014\n\u0014\n 5.  Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same \nstore. \u0014\n\u0014\n 6.  Do not buy food at the movie store.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n 7.  If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, \nlet alone eating.\u0014\n\u0014\n 8.  Remember:  \"Y'all\" is singular.  \"All y'all\" is plural. \"All \ny'all's\"  is plural possessive.\u0014\n\u0014\n 9.  There is nothing sillier than a Northerner imitating a southern \naccent, unless it is a southerner imitating a Boston accent.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Get used to hearing, \"You ain't from around here, are you?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n11. People walk slower here.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n12. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone.  They don't \nunderstand you either.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. The first Southern expression to creep into a \ntransplantedNortherner's vocabulary is the adjective \"big ol'\", as in \n\"big ol' truck\" or \"big   \u0014\nol' boy\".  Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced \ndialect with this expression.  One hundred percent are in denial \nabout it.\u0014\n\u0014\n14. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer \nproper.\u0014\n\u0014\n15. Be advised:  The \"He needed killin'\" defense is valid here.\u0014\n\u0014\n16. If attending a funeral in the South, remember, we stay until the\u0014\nlast shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, \"Hey, y'all, watch this!\" stay \nout of his way.  These are likely the last words he will ever say.\u0014\n\u0014\n18. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those \nwho do.  In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a \nsouthern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the \ncar was purchased.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n19. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their \ncar's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.\u0014\n\u0014\n20. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait \nuntil November.\u0014\n\u0014\n21. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the \nmost minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the \nlocal grocery store.  It does not matter if you need anything from \nthe store, it is just something you're supposed to do.\u0014\n\u0014\n22. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South.  When you \npurchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your \ntrailer.   This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost \nconsiderably more  than the trailer and should, therefore, be \ndisplayed.\u0014\n\u0014\n23. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in \ncommon. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a  trailer.\u0014\n\u0014\n24. Florida is not considered a southern state.  There are far more \nYankees than Southerners living there.\u0014\n\u0014\n25. In southern churches you will hear the hymn, All Glory, Laud and \nHonor. You will also hear expressions such as, \"Laud, have mercy\", \nGood Laud\", and \"Laudy, Laudy, Laudy\".\u0014\n\u0014\n26. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph  zone, \ndirectly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned  to \ndrive on a model of  vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the \nproper, speed and lane position for the vehicle.\u0014\n\u0014\n27. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already \nknow the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better  off \ntrying to find it yourself.\u0014",

These babies, however, had been in abusive situations. \nTheir parents let hem cry for hours on end and never responded. Do \nyou know what happened? The babies eventually quit crying. It is \nalmost as if they had learned that it was not worth trying.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the Menninger Institute came in for an experiment. They got some \npeople from retirement and from nursing homes, and every day these \npeople held these babies and rocked them. The object was to get these \nbabies to start crying again. And you know, it worked. Physical touch \nhad made the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs important as physical touch is there is another kind of touch that \nis even more important. It is spiritual touch. This is that special \ntouch that influences and impacts the lives of people. The telephone \ncompany some years ago had a slogan that you may recall: \"Reach out \nand touch someone.\" They were, of course, referring to a meaningful \nrelationship.\u0014",

    "title": "RULE OF WRITING ENGLISH",
    "words": "Here are several very important but often forgotten rules of \u0014\nEnglish:\u0014\n\u0014\n 1. Avoid alliteration. Always.\u0014\n 2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.\u0014\n 3. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat.)\u0014\n 4. Employ the vernacular.\u0014\n 5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.\u0014\n 6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.\u0014\n 7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.\u0014\n 8. Contractions aren't necessary.\u0014\n 9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.\u0014\n10. One should never generalize.\u0014\n11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said:\u0014\n    \"I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.\"\u0014\n12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.\u0014\n13. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; It's\u0014\n    highly superfluous.\u0014\n14. Profanity sucks.\u0014\n15. Be more or less specific.\u0014\n16. Understatement is always best.\u0014\n17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.\u0014\n18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.\u0014\n19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.\u0014\n20. The passive voice is to be avoided.\u0014\n21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.\u0014\n22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.\u0014\n23. Who needs rhetorical questions?\u0014",

I\u0014\n\tstumbled upon a story most\u0014\n\tstrange, like nothing my life,~mv\u0014\n\tstreet sense,my sly-tongue had\u0014\never prepared me for. Hushr- child, Hush, now, and I will-tellitto \nyou.\u0014\nEven before the dawn one Friday. morning I noticed ~ young man, \nhandsome and strong, walking the alleys of the City. He was pulling \nan old cart filled with clothes both bright and new, and he was \ncalling in a clear, tenor voice: Rags! Ah, the air was\u0014\n1 foul and the first light filthy to be crossed by such sweet music!\u0014\n\u0014\nRags! New rags for old! I take your tired rags! Rags!\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, this is a wonder, I thought to myself, for the man stood \nsix-feet. four, and his arms were Like tree limbs, hard and muscular, \nand his eyes flashed intelligence. Could he find no better job than \nthis, to be a ragman in the inner city?\u0014\n\u0014\nI followed him. My curiosity drove me. And I wasn't disappointed.\u0014\nSoon the Ragman saw a woman sitting on her back porch. She was \nsobbing into her handkerchief, sighing, and shedding a thousand \ntears. Her kneesand elbows-made-a-sa&X. Her shoulders shook. Her \nheart was breaking.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ragman stopped his cart. Quietly he walked to the woman, stepping \nround tin cans, dead toys, and Pam-pers. Give me your rag, he said \nso gently, and I'll give you another.\u0014\nHe slipped the handkerchief from her eyes. She looked up, and he laid \nacross her palm a linen cloth so clean and new that it shined. She \nblinked from the gift to the giver.\u0014\nThen, as he began to pull his cart again, the Ragman did a strange \nthing:\u0014\nhe put her stained, filthy handkerchief to his own face; and then he \nbegan to weep, to sob as grievously as she had done, his shoulders \nshaking. Yet she was left behind without a tear.\u0014\nThis is a wonder, I breathed to myself; and I followed the sobbing \nRagman like a child who cannot turn away from mystery.\u0014\n\u0014\nRags! Rags! New rags for old!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a little while, when the sky showed grey behind the rooftops and I \ncould see the shredded curtains hanging out bhwk windows, the \nRaginiui came upon a girl whose head was wrapped in a bandage, whose \neyes were empty. Blood soaked her bandage. A single line of blood ran \ndown her cheek.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow the tall Ragman looked upon this child with pity, and he drew a \nlovely yellow bonnet from his cart. Give me your rag, he said, \ntracing his own line on her cheek, and I'll give you mine.\u0014\nThe child could only gaze at him while he loosened the bandage, \nremoved it, and tied it to his own head. The bonnet he set on hers. \nAnd I gasped at what I saw: for with the bandage went the wound! \nAgainst his brow it ran a darker, more substantial bloodhis own!\u0014\n\u0014\nRags! Rags! I take old rags! cried the sobbing, bleeding, strong, \nintern-gent Ragman.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sun hurt the sky now, and my eyes;. the Ragman seemed more and \nmore in a hurry.\u0014\nAre you going to work? he asked a man who leaned against .a \ntelephone pole. The man shook his head. The Ragman inquired, Do you \nhave a job?\u0014\nAre you crazy? sneered the other. He pulled away from the pole, \nrevealing the right sleeve of his jacket. It was flat, the cuff \nstuffed into the pocket. He\u0014\nhad no arm.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo said the Ragman. Give me your jacket, and I'll give you mine.\u0014\n\u0014\nSUCH QUIET authority in his voice! The one-armed man took\u0014\noff his Jacket. So did the Ragmanand I trembled at what I saw: for \nthe Ragman's arm stayed In his jacket, and when the other put it on, \nthen he had two good arms, thick as tree limbs, but the ragman had \nonly one.\u0014\n\u0014\nGo to work, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter that he saw a drunk, lying\u0014\nunconscious beneath an army blanket, an old man, hurnched, \nwizened,and sick. He took that blanket and wrapped it round himself; \nbut for the drunk he left a new suit of clothes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now I had to run to keep up with the Ragman. Though he was\u0014\nweeping uncontrollably, and bleeding freely at his forehead, pulling \nhis cart with one arm, stumbling for drunkenness, falling again and \nagain, exhausted, old, old and sick, yet he went very fast, On \nspider's legs he skittered through the alleys of the City, this mile \nand the next, until he'd come to its limits, and then he rushed \nbeyond.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wept to see the change in this man. I hurt to see his sorrow. And \nyet l needed to see where he was going in; such a baste, perhaps to \nknow what drove him so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little old Ragmanhe came to a landfill. He came to a garbage \ndump. And then I wanted to help him in what he did, but I hung back, \nhiding. He climbed a hill. With tormented labor; he cleared a little \nspace on that hill! Then he sighed. He lay down. He! pillowed his \nhead on a handkerchief and a jacket. He covered his bones with an \narmy blanket. And he died.\u0014\nOh how I cried to witness that death! I slumped in a junked car and \nwailed and mourned as one who has no hopebecause I had come to love \nthe Ragman. Every other face had faded in the wonder of this man, and \nI cherished him; but he died. I cried myself to sleep.\u0014\nI did not knowhow could I know?that I slept through Friday night \nand Saturday and its night, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nBur then, on Sunday morning, I was wakened by a violence.

There \nwas the Ragman, folding the blanket most carefully, a scar on his \nforehead, but alive! And, besides that, healthy! There was no sign of \nsorrow nor of age~nd all the rags that he had gathered shined for \ncleanliness.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, then I lowered my head and, trembling for all that I had seen, \nI myself walked up to the Ragman. I told him my name with shame, for \nI was a sorry figure next to him. Then I took off all my clothes in \nthat place, and I said to him with dear yearning in my voice: Dress \nme.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe dressed me.

He would have gone his way, to Jerusalem and the place he \nbelieved God had prepared for him; I would have gone my way, home to \nmy wife and my children, my dog and my garden. He would have gone his \nway to glory, I my way to my duties and my responsibilities.\u0014\nOnly the Torah is the word of God. I think Christianity, beginning \nwith Jesus, took a wrong turn in abandoning the Torah. By the truth \nof the Torah, much that Jesus said is wrong. By the criterion of the \nTorah, Israel's religion in the time of Jesus was authentic and \nfaithful, not requiring reform or renewal, demanding only faith and \nloyalty to God and the sanctification of life through carrying out \nGod's will. Jesus and his disciples took one path, and we another. I \ndo not believe God would want it any other way. \u0014\nCitation: Jacob Neusner, a noted Talmudic scholar and author of A \nRabbi Talks with Jesus; source: \"A Rabbi Argues with Jesus,\" Newsweek \n(3-27-00)\u0014",

Others that come to \nmind include Gallant\u0014\n                      Fox's three-year-old year of 1930, the \nthree-year-old filly Twilight\u0014\n                      Tear's 1944 season, Native Dancer's \nthree-year-old season and\u0014\n                      Tom Fool's four-year old season, both in 1953, \nSwaps'\u0014\n                      four-year-old season of 1956, Buckpasser's \nsophomore season in\u0014\n                      1966, Dr. Fager's four-year-old season of 1968 \nand most recently,\u0014\n                      Spectacular Bid's four-year-old season in 1980. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After his initial two starts against older \nhorses, Citation returned to\u0014\n                      his own age group, winning the Everglades \nStakes and the\u0014\n                      Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah, the latter by six \nwidening lengths on\u0014\n                      the last day of February. With hardly a break \nbetween his juvenile\u0014\n                      and sophomore seasons and four races in \nFebruary, Citation was\u0014\n                      given a six-week rest. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      (It was during this time that Citation's rider, \nAl Snider, was swept\u0014\n                      out to sea while fishing off the Florida keys. \nHis body was never\u0014\n                      recovered.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Citation made his next start, under new pilot \nEddie Arcaro, on a\u0014\n                      wet, cold and miserable April day at old Havre \nde Grace racetrack\u0014\n                      in rural Maryland. In the six-furlong \nChesapeake Trial, he finished\u0014\n                      second to Saggy (who would later go on to sire \nchampion Carry\u0014\n                      Back). Citation's loss was blamed on three \nthings: Saggy's love for\u0014\n                      the mud; the fact that another horse had \ncarried Big Cy very wide;\u0014\n                      and Arcaro -- riding the champion for the first \ntime -- was\u0014\n                      instructed not to abuse the champ so close to \nthe Triple Crown.\u0014\n                      Citation would never lose another race that \nyear. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Later that same week, in the Chesapeake Stakes, \nCitation won\u0014\n                      easily and with Saggy nowhere at the finish. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During this time, horsemen in the county were \narguing whether\u0014\n                      there was any horse who could challenge \nCitation. The consensus\u0014\n                      was that only Coaltown had a shot. The \nbrilliant Calumet\u0014\n                      understudy to Citation was probably the most \nunderrated\u0014\n                      Thoroughbred of the 20th Century. Coaltown, who \nwould set world\u0014\n                      time records from six furlongs to one-mile and \none-quarter, was\u0014\n                      named Horse of the Year in 1949 in one major \nyear-end poll. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Coaltown easily smashed the field in \nKeeneland's Blue Grass\u0014\n                      Stakes while Citation took the Derby Trial at \nChurchill Downs the\u0014\n                      Tuesday before Derby Day.

Arcaro feared \nthat he was on the\u0014\n                      wrong Calumet runner, but his fears proved \nunfounded as Citation\u0014\n                      wore down pacesetter Coaltown to score an easy \nvictory in the\u0014\n                      74th Kentucky Derby. The Calumet entry paid \n$2.80, the lowest\u0014\n                      win price in Derby history. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Citation went on to score easily in the \nPreakness at Pimlico at 10\u0014\n                      cents on the dollar, the lowest price since the \nintroduction of\u0014\n                      pari-mutuel racing in Maryland in 1911. In \nbetween the Preakness\u0014\n                      and Belmont, Citation tuned up with an \n11-length victory in the\u0014\n                      Jersey Stakes at Garden State Park. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As usual, the Belmont Stakes answered the \nquestion of who could\u0014\n                      go one-mile and one-half. Eight horses showed \nup, indicating that\u0014\n                      some were hoping that Citation could not go \nthat far. They were\u0014\n                      wrong. Despite stumbling badly at the start, \nCitation recovered to\u0014\n                      win the Belmont by eight lengths, securing the \ncoveted Triple\u0014\n                      Crown. No horse would again wear that crown for \n25 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Citation moved on to Chicago where he annexed \nthe Stars and\u0014\n                      Stripes Handicap at Arlington Park and the \nBuckingham Purse and\u0014\n                      American Derby at Washington Park. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Back at Belmont Park, Citation won the Sysonby \nMile, beating the\u0014\n                      crack sprinter Spy Song on that Wednesday \nafternoon. Amazingly,\u0014\n                      on *only three days rest,* Citation came back \non Saturday to annex\u0014\n                      the two-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Citation finished out the season with victories \nin the Empire Gold\u0014\n                      Cup at Belmont, the Pimlico Special (in a rare \nwalkover) and two\u0014\n                      races at Tanforan in northern California, \nincluding the historic\u0014\n                      Tanforan Handicap. \u0014\n\u0014\n                             A RECAP OF CITATION'S 1948 SEASON\u0014\n\u0014\n                           19 wins in 20 starts \u0014\n                           Earnings of $709,470 (a then-world record \nfor a single\u0014\n                           season) \u0014\n                           Raced from February 2 to December 11 \u0014\n                           Beat older horses from February to \nDecember \u0014\n                           Won at six furlongs in February, August \nand December \u0014\n                           Won at every distance from six furlongs to \ntwo miles \u0014\n                           Won at 10 different racetracks \u0014\n                           Won in seven different states from New \nYork to California\u0014\n                           (traveling in un-airconditioned vans and \nrailroad boxcars) \u0014\n                           Won on tracks labeled fast, sloppy, heavy, \nmuddy and good \u0014\n                           Won his races by a cumulative total of 66 \nlengths \u0014\n                           Won the Triple Crown races by a total of \n17 lengths \u0014\n                           At yearend, his lifetime record stood at \n29 27-2-0 \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Throughout his career, Citation was often \ncompared to Man o'\u0014\n                      War.

More \n\"religious wars\" have been fought in the name of the Lord than it is \npossible to describe. Carnage, destruction, and death in the name of \nreligion are without parallel in the history of the Western world and \ncontinue until this very moment . . . all in the name of the church \nand holiness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    We have assumed that churchand-state is a \nphenomenon of the United States, but the seeds were sown long before \nthe settling of the first colony. It was a European upheaval that \ntriggered the cause of religious freedom and drove many of our \nearliest settlers to these shores. The experiment of trying to \nseparate the two was without any model in history. Futile attempts \nwere met with severe consequences and dealt with quickly and \nseverely, all in the name of the Lord. But the idea was in place from \nthe words of Jesus, \"Render to Caesar the things that are\u0014\nCaesar's and to God, the things that are God's.\" However, how to \naccomplish this principle has been a major issue for both church and \nstate. The struggle for the separation of church and state, or the \nplace of the church in the democratic process, is one that has been \nin a constant process of re-evaluation and adjustment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Church and state were joined in the settling of \nthe colonies. There were no walls of separation. Persons who were \npart of a church group blessed by the state were able to live in \nharmony without fear of retribution. Those who lived outside this \nboundary felt the sting of prosecution and persecution until \nreligious freedom was assured in the United States Constitution.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Jefferson Sought a Wall\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The experience of separation of church and state \nwas not embraced immediately. Thomas Jefferson called for \"a wall of \nseparation between church and state.\" James Madison wrestled with the \nwording of the First Amendment to the Constitution that would \n\"guarantee\" the right of \"freedom of worship\" and \"freedom from \nworship.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The assumption that \"once written always \npreserved\" has proven to be, in our society, incorrect. There are few \nabsolutes, even in a document as powerful as the Constitution of the \nUnited States. The issue of separation of church and state is a prime \nexample. Statements that define and redefine are constantly being \nreinterpreted and lines redrawn.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The struggle is a reality for all faiths - \nProtestant, Jew, Catholic, Moslem, and others. While the First \nAmendment sought to ease tensions and prevent religious wars on our \nsoil, its primary intention appeared to be keeping enough space \nbetween church and state, thus ensuring the integrity of both.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In spite of the best intentions of those who \nresist the separation, churches prosper when both the church and the \nstate are separated, preserving the dignity of both. The growth of \nreligious expression in this country is unprecedented in the history \nof faith. Strength has come in moments of disagreement. While this \nwas never the intended purpose of the First Amendment to the \nConstitution, church-and-state separation has nonetheless benefitted \nthe growth and fervor of religious expression in our country.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Are These Freedoms Equal?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But, does one group have the right to direct the \ncourse for the rest of us? Is freedom of religion equal to freedom \nfrom religion? These are some of the important questions being \naddressed and debated in our nation. These questions underlie such \nissues as prayer in schools, vouchers for secular and parochial \neducation, and endorsements of political candidates by churches or \ndenominations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I am a product of an educational system that did \ntwo things each day. The first was to pledge allegiance to the flag \nof the United States, and the other was prayer. These things were \ngood and meant a great deal to me as a child. Our nation was in the \nmidst of WWII. Each of us had family members and friends who were \nfighting. When the Western Union person came to a house, the entire \ntown knew what was happening; someone had paid with his life or was \nmissing in action.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     We renewed enthusiastically each morning a \npledge to our flag, and we invoked the power of God for victory. In  \nthe fourth grade, something happened that has continued to haunt me \nuntil this day. A new classmate was added to our class. She had come \nfrom a tradition that pledged allegiance to no flag. Each morning as \nwe arose, placed our right hands over our hearts, and pledged \nallegiance to the flag of the greatest nation on the face of  the \nEarth, this person sat in silence. I felt a rising indignation, as \ndid other members of our class. The protests were loud, spoken and \nunspoken.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Carefully, the teacher explained that any person \nof our nation had the right not to pledge allegiance and not to enter \ninto our kind of prayer, for any reason! Most of our class thought \nthe pledge was good for everyone, and its purpose was to support a \nmighty effort. Who could disagree with such a motivation? But, now I \nlook back on our class' reaction with regret. It was wrong for our \nclass to intimidate this person to participate in actions against her \nconscientious objections.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     There is no greater debate than the one that \nrages between the advocates of prayer in public schools and those  \nwho oppose it. Now we have come to the \"minute of silence,\" \nsufficient in the minds of most of us to answer the question, \"Should \nthere be prayer in public schools or no\"?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     There can be nothing wrong with a minute of \nsilence at the beginning of a school day to reflect, remember, or \npray.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Questions About the 'Minute'\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Should prayer be mentioned in the description \nof what the minute is about?\" comes the comment of one. \"Would it \ngive the impression that prayer in public education is coming through \nthe back door?\" \"Is this the first attempt to cross the line \nestablished by the Supreme Court that prohibits prayer in public \nschools?\" \"Who will define for our children what can or cannot be \ndone in this 'minute'?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     It appears the judicial system may need to \ninterpret what is and what is not acceptable. Was this the intent of \nthe First Amendment? Suddenly, what seemed to be so innocuous becomes \na major issue, and what seemed to be perfectly logical raises more \nquestions than many are willing to address. Has the line of \nseparation of church and\u0014\nstate been crossed?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In order to preserve the \"separation,\" the \nmoment the two lines become mingled, the line becomes blurred, and we \nface the dilemma of opting for the control of what will and will not \nbe done. Prayer is beneficial and necessary, but who composes and \ndecides what can and cannot be said? What is personal and has meaning \nfor one becomes offensive to another.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The debate continues to rage in the political, \nsocial, and religious communities. The lines are drawn between \n\"believers\" and \"non-believers.\" Believers agree that prayer is good, \nand non-believers often disagree. The statistics are waved in the \nface of the non-supporters, showing less violence in public education \nwhen prayer was permitted. No one in his right mind would advocate \ndoing anything but trying to lessen the disasters that have occurred \nin public education through the violence that is expressed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The line between church and state has become \neven more blurred when congregations and denominations have endorsed \ncandidates. National conventions feature candidates of one political \nparty or the other, which are usually followed by voter guidelines. \nCandidates are endorsed. Litmus tests are applied. Should these \ncandidates be elected, local and national groups expect their \nphilosophy to be put into law by the elected leader. So blurred has \nthis line become that the IRS has stepped in to take tax-exempt \nstatus away from churches that have violated this separation. The \nseparation of church and state is constantly being defined and \nredefined.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The church has the responsibility to speak to \nthe conscience of our nation with a voice that is clear and \nunencumbered, free from any connection to the state. The church must \nbe separated from the government to which it speaks as its conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Prayer Remains in Schools\u0014\n\u0014\n                     It is a myth that prayer has been voted out of \npublic schools. Is there a prohibition against students saying grace \nbefore meals or meeting friends for a time of prayer? How about the \ngroup that \"meets at the flagpole\"? Granted, emotion runs very deep \nwhen we remember \"the good old days.\" The good old days may not have \nbeen so good for those who decided they could not participate. We \nassume, in our nation, that once a principle is in place, it will \nforever remain, never needing to be defended or defined again. But, \nevery generation must reclaim those principles that have made our \nnation strong.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The danger can even come from religion itself. A \nformer pastor of a large church in Texas said on national television \nthat the separation of church and state \"is the figment of some \ninfidel's imagination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The church must be separated from the state. If \nwe are to continue to be free to express our deep sense of commitment \nto the principles of each of our traditions, lines cannot be so \nblurred. This blurring invites intrusion from those who would dictate \nthe order and procedures.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     We can support whomever we will in the political \narena. That is the nature of democracy! No unholy alliances of church \nand state should be tolerated. We must guarantee freedom of religion \nand freedom from religion. The state must be free to be the state and \nthe church to be the church. \"Render unto Caesar the things that are \nCaesar's and unto God, the things that are God's.\"\u0014",

What is amplified here is the extent of his fears about\u0014\n                     who killed his brother.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Far from a ruthless exercise to reclaim the \npresidency for his family, RFK's doomed 1968 campaign was not only\u0014\n                     initially reluctant but consistently chaotic. \nBut in it, RFK found his voice as a champion of the downtrodden, for\u0014\n                     whom he had felt sympathy ever since his \nchildhood.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     AND WHAT of Marilyn Monroe? Thomas tentatively \nconcludes that there was no affair, that evidence to the\u0014\n                     contrary may well have been a fantasy born in \nthe actress's disturbed mind.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Be that as it may - and no one can ever know for \nsure - Thomas makes a compelling case that RFK was a\u0014\n                     fundamentally good man with major flaws, both \nqualities the product of his fears. And he addresses the\u0014\n                     complexity of his subject when he writes:\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"We will never know what kind of President \nRobert Kennedy might have been. He might have been rash, he\u0014\n                     might have tried to do too much, and he might \nhave blundered . . . .He probably would have been devious in\u0014\n                     some ways, and it is not impossible to imagine \nhim abusing the power of his office. But he would have surely\u0014\n                     tried to tackle the problems of poverty and \ndiscrimination, and he would have tried to end the killing in Vietnam\u0014\n                     long before President Nixon did . . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Possibly, the clash of politics, of trying to \nseek radical solutions in a country that was more conservative than\u0014\n                     liberal in 1969, would have paralyzed Kennedy or \nmade him more timid in deeds than words. Failure, in a divided\u0014\n                     country in a confused time, was probably more \nlikely than not. Nonetheless, Kennedy's life story suggests that\u0014\n                     had he failed, he would have failed trying his \nutmost to lift up the poor and the weak.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     RFK DIED at 42. From the moment of his death, he \nbecame a mythic figure. In his eulogy, Senator Edward M.\u0014\n                     Kennedy said: \"My brother need not be idealized, \nor enlarged in death beyond what he was in life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In writing this biography, Evan Thomas has taken \nthose words to heart. This is a major, authoritative work,\u0014\n                     neither hagiography nor hatchet job, at once \neminently fair and sympathetic. The reader finishes Thomas' study\u0014\n                     with as complete an account as we are likely to \nget of this complicated, many-faceted man.\u0014",

    "title": "REAL SEX--HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?",
    "words": "REAL SEX\u0014\nby Melissa and Louis McBurney, M.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow Much Is Enough?\u0014\nNegotiating the difference in your sex drives\u0014\n\u0014\nHow much is enough sex?\u0014\nThe answer is different for every individual, so it's no wonder that \nnearly every two people find they have some difference of opinion \nwhen it comes to the frequency of intercourse.\u0014\nOf all the areas of tension in marital sexuality, this difference in \ndesired frequency is the most troublesome. It's simply not an easily \ncompromised issue.\u0014\nOne reason for the tension is that sex is exclusive and mutual. \nSexual frequency is a two-person decision. Usually men have the \nhigher libidinous drive (because of the colossal impact of \ntestosterone), but certainly not always. Whichever spouse has the \nhigher desire feels the most frustration. And the difference is not \nsomething that could be anticipated from your dating days. In the \nexcitement and romance of courtship, both partners show an intense \nneed for physical affection. Both partners seem motivated to express \ntheir love sexually, whether or not they waited for marriage for \nintercourse.\u0014\nAnother reason for tension is that our sense of adequacy is connected \nwith sexual performance. When a wife turns down a husband, for \nwhatever reason, the husband tends to interpret her refusal as a \nrejection of his manhood. When a husband pushes for more frequent \nsex, a wife might wonder what's wrong with her femininity if she \ndoesn't desire intercourse. The frequency question gets loaded. It's \nno longer just a matter of negotiating a satisfactory compromise \nbecause each partner's self-acceptance hangs in the balance.\u0014\nFinally, tensions creep in because there are so many symbolic \nmessages included in the sex relationship. Marital sex can hardly \navoid being an expression of emotions such as anger, guilt, fear, \nshame, jealousy, desire for control.\u0014\nAnger can often affect a woman's responsivity more intensely than it \ndoes a man's. Perhaps this phenomenon stems from the physical \nexpression of intercourse: a woman must open herself to being \npenetrated. That requires a willing vulnerabilityhard to achieve \nwhen she feels angry or hurt. For a man, sexual activity could be an \naggressive (even angry) act or can simply override the emotion of \nconflict. In other words, a husband can pursue sexual intimacy even \nif the couple has recently been fighting.\u0014\nGuilt also gets in the way of frequency. For instance, guilt over \npremarital sex may create barriers to enjoyment later on. Any \nperceived sexual sin could cause a person to feel unworthy of sexual \npleasure. Fortunately, confession and forgiveness bring cleansing \nfrom real guilt. And false guilt, like the shame a person who has \nbeen abused may feel, can be identified and overcome, usually with \ncounseling.\u0014\nSometimes frequency of intercourse can be inhibited by fear, which is \nexperienced by both men and women. Fears can stem from early sexual \nabuse, performance failure, or even the possibility of pregnancy.\u0014\nSometimes shame, a feeling created by disapproval and humiliation, \nenters the picture. Some people feel shame associated with nakedness, \nwhether from their family of origin or from some thoughtless ridicule \nwithin the marriage. Revealing yourself totally always carries a risk \nof embarrassment or rejection.\u0014\nJealousy is a potent disrupter of sexual balance as well. Since \nmarriage begins with a vow of exclusivity, it's crucial for spouses \nto express any hint of jealousy. Often the spouse is unaware of \nactions or attitudes that create the jealous feelings. Remind each \nother of your vows by confessing your feelings of jealousy (without \nblaming statements like, \"You're giving her too much attention. Stop \nit or else!\").\u0014\nSo how much sex is enough sex? The answer lies between the two of \nyou, exclusively and mutually. There is no outside standard. If \nyou're struggling with the differences in your sex drive, you'll have \nto keep working together toward sexual oneness. Discuss these \nbarriers to desire to make sure these issues aren't skewing your \nexperience of enjoyment together. Sexual oneness is a processand one \nthat can bring satisfaction on every level of your marriage.\u0014\nMelissa and Louis McBurney, M.D., are marriage therapists and \nco-founders of Marble Retreat in Marble, Colorado, where they counsel \nclergy couples.\u0014\nCopyright  2000 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Marriage Partnership magazine. \\Click here for reprint \ninformation on Marriage Partnership.\u0014\nWinter 2000, Vol. 17, No. 4, Page 84\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014\nDiscuss this article on the 'Real Sex' message board\u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014\nRead more from 'Real Sex'\u0014",

    "words": "Robert E. Lee, the fourth son of Colonel Henry Lee and Ann Hill \nCarter, was born in Stratford, Virginia on 19th\u0014\n      January, 1807. After graduating second in a class of 46 from \nthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1829, he\u0014\n      was commissioned into the Engineering Corps. He served under \nWinfield Scott in the US Army and saw action in the\u0014\n      Mexican War (1846-48) where he won three brevets for gallantry. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Lee was appointed superintendent at West Point from 1852 to \n1855 when he left to become lieutenant colonel in the\u0014\n      2nd Cavalry in Texas. In 1859 he led the company of U.S. \nMarines that captured John Brown at Harper's Ferry. in\u0014\n      October, 1859. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In February, 1861 Winfield Scott recalled Lee to Washington and \nPresident Abraham Lincoln offered him the post of\u0014\n      field commander of the Union Army. Lee declined the offer and \nalthough he opposed slavery and secession, he felt\u0014\n      that his first loyalty was to Virginia and resigned his \ncommission. He returned to the South and became military\u0014\n      adviser to President Jefferson Davis. In July he was asked to \norganize the Confederate Army defending the South\u0014\n      Atlantic coast. \u0014\n\u0014\n      President Jefferson Davis recalled Lee to Richmond in March, \n1862. It was Lee's plan that was carried out by Thomas\u0014\n      Stonewall Jackson that prevented reinforcements from reaching \nGeorge McClellan and the Union Army, whose army\u0014\n      was posing a serious threat to the capital of the Confederacy. \u0014\n\u0014\n      General Joseph E. Johnson was badly wounded at Fair Oaks Lee \nwas given command of the Army of Northern\u0014\n      Virginia. For the next two years, Lee with inferior numbers, \nfrustrated attempts by the Union Army to capture\u0014\n      Richmond. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In April, 1863, General Joseph Hooker, the commander of the \nArmy of the Potomac, decided to attack Lee's army\u0014\n      that had been entrenched on the south side of the Rappahonnock \nRiver since the battle of Fredericksburg. Hooker\u0014\n      crossed the river and took up position at Chancellorsville. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Although outnumbered two to one, Lee opted to split his \nConfederate Army into two groups. Lee left 10,000 men\u0014\n      under Jubal Early, while on 2nd May, he sent Thomas Stonewall \nJackson to attacked the flank of Hooker's army. The\u0014\n      attack was successful but after returning from the battlefield \nJackson was accidentally shot by one of his own men.\u0014\n      Jackson's left arm was successfully amputated but he developed \npneumonia and he died eight days later. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On the 3rd May, James Jeb Stuart, who had taken command of \nJackson's troops, mounted another attack and drove\u0014\n      Joseph Hooker back further. The following day Lee and Jubal \nEarly joined the attack on the Union Army. By 6th May,\u0014\n      Hooker had lost over 11,000 men, and decided to retreat from \nthe area. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Lee now decided to take the war to the north. The Confederate \nArmy reached Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on 1st July.\u0014\n      The town was quickly taken but the Union Army, led by Major \nGeneral George Meade, arrived in force soon\u0014\n      afterwards and for the next two days the town was the scene of \nbitter fighting. Attacks led by James Jeb Stuart and\u0014\n      James Longstreet proved costly and by the 5th July, Lee decided \nto retreat south. Both sides suffered heavy losses\u0014\n      with Lee losing 28,063 men and Meade 23,049. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In March, 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was named lieutenant general \nand the commander of the Union Army. He joined\u0014\n      the Army of the Potomac where he worked with George Meade and \nPhilip Sheridan. They crossed the Rapidan and\u0014\n      entered the Wilderness. When Lee heard the news he sent in his \ntroops, hoping that the Union's superior artillery and\u0014\n      cavalry would be offset by the heavy underbrush of the \nWilderness. Fighting began on the 5th May and two days later\u0014\n      smoldering paper cartridges set fire to dry leaves and around \n200 wounded men were either suffocated or burned to\u0014\n      death. Of the 88,892 men that Grant took into the Wilderness, \n14,283 were casualties and 3,383 were reported\u0014\n      missing. Lee lost 7,750 men during the fighting. \u0014\n\u0014\n      After the battle Ulysses S. Grant moved south and on May 26th \nsent Philip Sheridan and his cavalry ahead to\u0014\n      capture Cold Harbor from the Confederate Army. Lee was forced \nto abandon Cold Harbor and his whole army well dug\u0014\n      in by the time the rest of the Union Army arrived. Grant's \nordered a direct assault but afterwards admitted this was a\u0014\n      mistake losing 12,000 men \"without benefit to compensate\". \u0014\n\u0014\n      Grant now headed quickly towards Richmond and was able to take \nPetersburg before Lee had time to react.\u0014\n      However, Pierre T. Beauregard was able to protect the route to \nthe city before the arrival of Lee's main army. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In March, 1865, William Sherman joined Ulysses S. Grant and the \nmain army at Petersburg. On 1st April Sherman\u0014\n      attacked at Five Forks. The Confederates, led by Major General \nGeorge Pickett, were overwhelmed and lost 5,200\u0014\n      men. On hearing the news, Lee decided to abandon Richmond and \njoin Joseph E. Johnson in an attempt to halt\u0014\n      Sherman's army in South Carolina. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Lee was only able to muster an army of 8,000 men. He probed the \nUnion Army at Appomattox but faced by 110,000\u0014\n      men he decided the cause was hopeless. He contacted Ulysses S. \nGrant and after agreeing terms on 9th April,\u0014\n      surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House. Grant issued a \nbrief statement: \"The war is over; the rebels are\u0014\n      our countrymen again and the best sign of rejoicing after the \nvictory will be to abstain from all demonstrations in the\u0014\n      field.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      After the war Lee became president of Washington College. \nAlthough President Andrew Johnson never granted him\u0014\n      official amnesty he continued to work for reconciliation. \nRobert Edward Lee died on 12th October, 1870. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (1) Robert E.

I,\u0014\n      therefore, tender my resignation, which I request you will \nrecommend for acceptance. It would have been presented at\u0014\n      once but for the struggle it has cost me to separate myself \nfrom a service to which I have devoted the best years of\u0014\n      my life and all the ability I possessed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (2) Robert E. Lee, letter to his sister, Anne Marshall (20th \nApril, 1861)\u0014\n\u0014\n      With all my devotion to the Union and the feeling of loyalty \nand duty of an American citizen, I have not been able to\u0014\n      make up my mind to raise my land against my relatives, my \nchildren, my home. I have, therefore, resigned my\u0014\n      commission in the Army, and save in defense of my native state, \nwith the sincere hope that my poor services may\u0014\n      never be needed, I hope I may never be called on to draw my \nsword. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (3) Mary Boykin Chesnut, Richmond, Virginia, diary entry (1st \nJanuary, 1864)\u0014\n\u0014\n      One more year of \"Stonewall\" would have saved us. Chickamauga \nis the only battle we have gained since \"Stonewall\"\u0014\n      died, and no results follow as usual. \"Stonewall\" was not so \nmuch killed by a Yankee; he was shot by his own men;\u0014\n      that is hard. General Lee can do no more than keep back Meade. \n\"One of Meade's armies, you mean,\" said I, \"for\u0014\n      they have only to double on him when Lee whips one of them.\" If \nGeneral Lee had had Grant's resources, he would\u0014\n      have bagged the last Yankee or have had them all safe back in \nMassachusetts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (4) General Oliver Howard summarized the state of the \nConfederate Army after the battle of\u0014\n      Chancellorsville in May, 1863. \u0014\n\u0014\n      We could gather little hope from the splendid condition of \nLee's army. It had been reorganized. Its numerous brigades\u0014\n      were grouped into divisions and the divisions into three army \ncorps, and cavalry. Stonewall Jackson, it is true, was no\u0014\n      more, but the three lieutenant generals - Longstreet, A. P. \nHill, and Ewell - were not wanting in ability or experience.\u0014\n      They were trusted by Lee and believed in by the troops and \npeople. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (5) John Singleton Mosby, Memoirs of Colonel John S.

Lee was in August, \n1862, when I brought the news of Burnside's\u0014\n      reinforcement of Pope, a story I have told in the preceding \npages. The next time we met was at his headquarters in\u0014\n      Orange, about two months after Gettysburg. He did not seem in \nthe least depressed, and was as buoyant and\u0014\n      aggressive as ever. He took a deep interest in my operations, \nfor there was nothing of the Fabius in his character.\u0014\n      Lee was the most aggressive man I met in the war, and was \nalways ready for an enterprise. I believe that his interest\u0014\n      in me was largely due to the fact that his father, \"Light Horse \nHarry\", was a partisan officer in the Revolutionary War.\u0014\n\u0014\n      After General Stuart was killed, in May, 1864, I reported \ndirectly to General Lee. During the siege of Petersburg I\u0014\n      visited him three times - twice when I was wounded. Once, when \nI got out of the ambulance, he was standing near,\u0014\n      talking to General Longstreet. When he saw me hobbling up to \nhim on crutches, he came to meet me, introduced me\u0014\n      to General Longstreet, and said, \"Colonel, the only fault I \nhave ever had to find with you is that you are always getting\u0014\n      wounded.\" Such a speech from General Lee more than repaid me \nfor my wound.\u0014\n\u0014\n      The last time I saw him during the war was about two months \nbefore the surrender. I had been wounded again. He\u0014\n      was not only kind, but affectionate, and asked me to take \ndinner with him, though he said he hadn't much to eat.\u0014\n      There was a leg of mutton on the table; he remarked that some \nof his staff officers must have stolen it.\u0014\n\u0014\n      After dinner, when we were alone, he talked very freely. He \nsaid that in the spring of 1862, Joe Johnston ought not to\u0014\n      have fallen back from the Rapidan to Richmond, and that he had \nwritten urging him to turn against Washington. He\u0014\n      also said that when Joe Johnston evacuated his lines at \nYorktown, in May of that year, he should have given battle\u0014\n      with his whole force on the isthmus at Williamsburg, instead of \nmaking a rear-guard fight.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (6) Carl Schurz wrote about the relative merits of Robert E. \nLee, William Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant in\u0014\n      his autobiography published in 1906. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In the opinion of many competent persons, he was the ablest \ncommander of them all. I remember a remarkable\u0014\n      utterance of his when we were speaking of Grant's campaign. \n\"There was a difference,\" Sherman said, \"between\u0014\n      Grant's and my way of looking at things. Grant never cared a \ndamn about what was going on behind the enemy's\u0014\n      lines, but it often scared me like the devil.\" He admitted, and \njustly so, that some of Grant's successes were owing to\u0014\n      this very fact, but also some of his most conspicuous failures. \nGrant believed in hammering - Sherman in\u0014\n      maneuvering. It had been the habit of the generals commanding \nthe Army of the Potomac to cross the\u0014\n      Rappahannock, to get their drubbing from Lee, and then promptly \nto retreat and recross the Rappahannock again in\u0014\n      retreat. He sturdily went on, hammering and hammering, and, \nwith his vastly superior resources, finally hammered\u0014\n      Lee's army to pieces, but with a most dreadful sacrifice of \nlife on his own part. Now, comparing Grant's campaign for\u0014\n      the taking of Richmond with Sherman's campaign for the taking \nof Atlanta - without losing sight of any of the\u0014\n      differences of their respective situations - we may well arrive \nat the conclusion that Sherman was the superior\u0014\n      strategist and the greater general. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (7) Brigadier General Horace Porter recorded General Robert \nLee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant\u0014\n      on 9th April, 1865. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The contrast between the two commanders was striking and could \nnot fail to attract marked attention as they sat ten\u0014\n      feet apart facing each other. General Grant, then nearly \nforty-three years of age, was five feet eight inches in height,\u0014\n      with shoulders slightly stooped. His hair and full beard were a \nnutbrown, without a trace of gray in them. He had on a\u0014\n      single-breasted blouse, made of dark-blue flannel, unbuttoned \nin front, and showing a waistcoat underneath. He had\u0014\n      no sword, and a pair of shoulder straps was all there was about \nhim to designate his rank. In fact, aside from these,\u0014\n      his uniform was that of a private soldier. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Lee, on the other hand, was fully six feet in height and quite \nerect for one of his age, for he was Grant's senior by\u0014\n      sixteen years. His hair and full beard were a silver-gray, and \nquite thick, except that the hair had become a little thin\u0014\n      in front. He wore a new uniform of Confederate gray, buttoned \nup to the throat, and at his side he carried a long sword\u0014\n      of exceedingly fine workmanship, the hilt studdied with jewels\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (8) Robert E. Lee, farewell message to the Army of Northern \nVirginia (9th April, 1865) \u0014\n\u0014\n      After four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed \ncourage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been \ncompelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources. I need not \ntell the survivors of so many hard-fought battles, who have remained \nsteadfast to the last, and I have consented to this result from no \ndistrust of them; but, feeling that valor and devotion could \naccomplish nothing that could compensate for the loss that would have \nattended the continuation to the contest, I have determined to avoid \nthe useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them \nto their countrymen. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (9) Robert E. Lee, letter to Josiah Tattnall (7th September, \n1865) \u0014\n\u0014\n      The war being at an end, the Southern states having laid down \ntheir arms and the questions at issue between them and the Northern \nstates having been decided, I believe it to be the duty of everyone \nto unite in the restoration of the country and the re-establishment \nof peace and harmony. These considerations governed me in the \ncounsels I gave to others and induced me on the 13th June to make \napplication to be included in the terms of the amnesty  proclamation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Amazon Books\u0014",

    "title": "REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY",
    "words": "By Tan Flippin\u0014\n\u0014\nA new nationwide survey of teenagers directed and analyzed by\u0014\nChristian sociologist George Barna reveals the typical \"good news/bad \nnews\" scenario. The good news is that youth ministry will no doubt \nhave plenty of ministry opportunities in the future to minister to \nyouth and their parents and families in a variety of situations. \nThere will no doubt also be creative ways developed in the future \nwhich will enable youth leaders with new, different and better \nmethods in which to do this.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bad news is a shift in thinking that should concern youth \nministers.\u0014\nIt has to do with a loyalty and dedication to the Christian faith \nthat could best be described as superficial. In fact, the future of \nthe Christian church as a whole may be weakened by current teens' \nplans to reduce their already minimal commitment to the Christian \nfaith. Barna's information should serve as a wake-up call for all who \nare involved in ministering to today's--and tomorrow's--teen-agers.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany sources of information de- scribe teen-agers today as deeply \nreli- gious individuals who have integrated the Christian faith into \nthe very fabric of their lifestyles. While this is no doubt the case \nin the lives of many teen-agers, the latest Barna survey, titIed \n\"Third Millennium Teens,\" suggests that faith is pretty much a \nsubjective area in the lives of most youth--just one of many parts of \ntheir life that blend into their total experi- ence. Unfortunately, \nneither their be- havior nor their beliefs as a generation, at least \naccording to George Barna, support the notion that they\u0014\nare deeply spiritual or truly committed to the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea that because youth spend time discussing spiritual matters \nmakes them strong Christians is not necessarily correct. Barna's \nresearch tends to show that discussing spiritual things certainly \ndoes not translate into a deeper sense of spirituality. In other \nwords, youth as a whole talk a good game, but their lives typically \ndo not match up with their words. As a result, the current group of \nteens as a whole is surprisingly even less committed than are the \nbaby boomers-- which have, of course, always been considered the \nleast committed generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, who are these current \"third millennium\" teens and what do they \nthink about faith, Christianity and the church?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked to describe themselves, 64 percent of the youth in the new \nBarna survey said they were \"religious.\" Sixty percent referred to \nthemselves as \"spiritual,\" and 60 percent described themselves as \n\"committed Christians.\" Barna reports that these figures are roughly \nthe equivalent to how adults would respond.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, however, among the 60 percent who refer to themselves \nas \"committed Christians,\" only half actually qualify as true \nbom-again Christians. That is the number who responded that they had \n\"made a personal commitment to Jesus\u0014\nChrist that is important in their\u0014\nlife.\" This implies that to the youth in this survey, being a \ncommitted Christian does not necessarily mean that one must have a \nrelationship with Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother way the Barna survey measured the significance of true \nspirituality in the lives of youth was to explore their goals for the \nfuture. When the teen-agers in the nation-\u0014\nal survey were asked to rate the desirability of a number of possible \noutcomes, spiritual aspects on the list ranked only moderate at best, \nand usually low on the list. Highest ranking among the list of the 19 \npossibilities on the survey of goals for the future was \"having a \nclose, personal relationship with God,\" which ranked 8th out of the \n19 possibilities. The statement \"being\u0014\ndeeply committed to the Christian faith\" ranked 14th out of the list \nof 19. And \"being personally active in a church\" placed only 16th out \nof the 19 considerations. Overall, the highest-ranking options on the \nsur- vey related to future goals were in the areas of personal \nrelationships\u0014\nand lifestyle comforts. The results clearly showed that religious \nmatters were less important considerations to teen-agers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the vast majority of adolescents in the survey responded \nthat they believed in God, only about two out of every three \n\"strongly desired having a personal relationship\" with Him. Likewise, \nwhile nearly all of the youth believed Jesus was a real person and \nover 80 percent of them described themselves as Christians, only \nabout half of them said they were \"very eager to be committed to the \nChristian faith.\" The Barna report also showed that only about 40 \npercent are excited about being active in church. Of the eight out of \nten who said they were Christians, less than three out of the eight \nalso claimed to be \"absolutely committed to the Christian faith.\" To \nput these statistics in a nutshell, it is accurate to say that \nteen-agers for the most part say that faith is important ...but don't \nexpect it to make a difference in their lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Barna, teen-agers today are more broadly involved in \nchurch activities than are adults. That is, they attend more \ndifferent kinds of activities in churches than their adult \ncounterparts. Students in the survey reported that: (1) half will \nattend a worship service in a typical week, (2) one-third will attend \nSunday School.\u0014",

    "title": "RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE",
    "words": "Jonathan Gallagher holds a doctorate in divinity from St. Andrews, \nScotland. His career as a communicator, administrator, author, and \ninternational religious liberty advocate \u0014\n\u0014\nMy kingdom is not of this world,\" Jesus of Nazareth, bound and \ncaptive, told Pilate, representative of the ancient world's \nsuperpower. Yet the pressing questions of freedom and acquiescence \nunder state authority continue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue might be framed as one of kingdom rights. How are \nindividuals and a society to address the trade-off between individual \nfreedoms and collective benefit? .The right to dissent from a \nmajority consensus may be a laudable philosophical ideal, but as a \npractical process in society it is a very different and difficult \nmatter. Most of all is this so when such choices to dissent or \ndisobey arise from religious convictions that are seen as directly \nattacking the very fabric of the governmental process. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn such instances the reaction of the state can be swift and severe, \nsince toleration of individual conscience seems only permissible when \nthe functioning of government is not otherwise disturbed. Is \nreligious freedom to be seen as an inalienable right, or is it \ncircumscribed by the responsibility of allegiance to the state? Are \nthe princi- ples of civil disobedience particularly relevant to \nfreedom of religion, or are such principles out of harmony with the \nfundamentals of religious beliefs? And if civil disobedience should \nbe invoked when religious liberty is compromised, to what extent are \n\"illegal\" activities condoned?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn most societies it is generally conceded that individuals may \nbelieve whatever they may choose. The difficulties arise in how such \nbeliefs are practiced and how they impact society. Intolerance of \nreligion is not in the mind but in action. And this is where \nreligious freedom and civil disobedience may come together in ways \nthat both disturb the convictions of the believer and the regulatory \nprocesses of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the clearest demonstrations of the impact of civil \ndisobedience in recent history is that of Mahatma Gandhi's satyagraha \n(his pro- gram of passive resistance against British rule in India in \nthe period following the Second World War). That too had religious \novertones in that Gandhi was also attempting to allow a wide form of \nreligious pluralism, often against the wishes of some of his fellow \nreformers. His con - cept of nonviolent resistance to an oppressive \nregime marks this \"freedom struggle\" as of interest here.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his analysis of the principles and process of government, Gandhi \nexpressed similar thoughts to the American philosopher Henry David \nThoreau and emphasized the necessity for the option of dissent: \"Most \npeople do not understand the complicated machinery of the government. \nThey do not realize that every cit- izen silently but none the less \ncertainly sustains the government of the day in ways of which he has \nno knowledge. Every citizen therefore ren- ders himself responsible \nfor every act of his gov- ernment. And it is quite proper to support \nit so long as the actions of the government are bear- able. But when \nthey hurt him and his nation, it becomes his duty to withdraw his \nsupport.\"l\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, says Gandhi, dissent, and by consequence, civil \ndisobedience, is a requirement when faced with a government and \nlegislation that runs counter to your beliefs: \"Disobedience to the \nlaw of the State becomes a peremptory duty when it comes in conflict \nwith the law of God.\"2 Gandhi's appeal is to the \"higher\" law of God, \nan appeal that many have turned to. When confronted with a \nrequirement that prevented their freedom of religious speech and the \nright to proselytize, Jesus' disciples refused to obey, citing the \nhigher requirement to obey God rather than human beings. Similarly \nJesus, when confronted with apparently contradictory religious and \nsecular laws, made it clear that each was relevant in its own \nsphere-giving to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet for the religious believer of whatever faith, civil disobedience \nraises many questions. Are religious people not called to be model \ncitizens? Is not the alternative of anarchy even worse than bad \ngovernment? What of God- given government? Is it not highly \nself-centered for anyone individual to decide he or she is \"above\" \nthe law? At what time does the burden of the state become \nintolerable? What form should civil disobedience and protest take? \nWhat of the resort to force to achieve the ben- efit of religious \nfreedom?\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce again Gandhi, with some propositions for civil disobedience from \na perspective of \"higher principles\": \"A call may come which one dare \nnot neglect, cost what it may. I can clearly see the time coming to \nme when I must refuse obedience to every single State-made law. \n...When neglect of the call means a denial of God, civil disobedience \nbecomes a peremptory duty.\"3\u0014\n\u0014\nSubmission to laws that violate freedom of conscience and religious \nliberty is \"an immoral barter.\" It is unacceptable to trade \nconvictions of faith for security or toleration from the state. \"It \nis no part of a citizen's duty to pay blind obedience to the laws \nimposed on him.\"4\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, this is not violent conflict. \"But every nation and every \nindividual have the right, and it is their duty, to rise against an \nintolerable wrong. I do not believe in armed risings. They are a \nremedy worse than the dis- ease sought to be cured. They are a token \nof the spirit of revenge and impatience and anger. The method of \nviolence cannot do good in the long run. ...We have a better method. \nUnlike that of violence, it certainly involves the exercise of \nrestraint and patience; but it requires also res- oluteness of will. \nThis method is to refuse to be party to the wrong.\"'\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course the American Henry David Thoreau grappled with these issues \nyears ear- lier: \"Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least \ndegree, resign his conscience to the leg- islator? Why has every man \na conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects \nafterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so \nmuch as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to \nassume is to do at any time what I think right.\"6\u0014\n\u0014\nThoreau discovered for himself the challenges of civil disobedience. \nRefusing to pay his poll tax (objecting to the state's support of \nslavery and also not wishing to fund the Mexican war), Thoreau was \njailed. His stay was just a night, since someone paid his poll tax \nfor him, much to his annoyance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. echoed Gandhi \nand Thoreau when he wrote. \" ...there are two types of laws: just and \nunjust. ...One has not only a legal but a moral resposibility to obey \njust laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey \nunjust laws.\"7\u0014\n\u0014\nBack to some of those still disturbing ques- tions.Is this not \nanarchy, a government of the one? To which the quick answer is that \nall gov- ernments are essentially governments of indi- viduals. \nSurely the answer is as the state seeks to mandate in terms of what \nits \"subjects\" shall think and believe. That is the reason \nlegislation that burdens religion is so counterproductive for the \nstate, since it weakens the consensus on which government depends.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut is not government God-given? Yes, but only in its own sphere of \noperations. When Caesar demands what is God's, then Caesar must be \nrefused. In fact, civil disobedience is a duty where the alternative \nis the sacrifice of reli- gious freedom. As nations and states make \nlaws that violate freedom of conscience and as soci- eties proscribe \nreligious practices ( except as such practices damage the basic \nrights of oth- ers), the need for nonviolent disobedience can only \nincrease. The greater danger is not from religious pluralism or \nsectarian oddity or faith apathy but from religious fundamentalism \nthat denies freedom to minorities, from secular states that restrict \nreligious activities, and from a global attitude that sees conformity \nin thought as worth the blood of any number of martyrs.\u0014\nThough democracry may be applauded, it cannot safeguard religious \nfreedom, for the majority is frequently ready to legislate against \nminorities.  For this reason, the right to refuse must always be \nthere.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Reformation in England, and in particular after the \nGunpowder Plot of 1605, CAtholics and others were required to pay \n\"recusancy\" fines for nonattendance at Anglican churches. In such a \nsiituation whaht would you have done?  As a CAtholic, would you pay \nthe fine to the government that is violating your religious liberty \nrights? Or would you attend the Anglican Church while keeping your \nfaith with your internal beliefs? Or as an Anglican, would you \nprotest such discriminatory laws?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Soviet Union your children are required to attend school on \nSaturday. As a Seventh-day Adventist or a follower of Judaism, you \nhold the Sabbath sacred. So do you send your children to school, or \nkeep them home with you or in church, risking that the state will \ntake your children?\u0014\n\u0014\nA conscientious objector, you refuse to bear arms. Your country \ndemands that you serve in the military and does not provide any \nalterna- tive. Do you enter the military and try to do your best \nthere? Or refuse, and go to prison, or worse? Or flee the country, \nleaving your family behind? Or to adopt the principles of civil dis- \nobedience, do you deliberately flout the law, encourage others to do \nso, and start a campaign against such laws?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe siege of the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, still \ntroubles many. Law and prejudice were set on dealing with a group \nthat by any standards had bizarre beliefs and unlawful practices. But \neven for them, where should allegiance to the state have ended and \ncivil disobedience have begun?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are touchy subjects-they unsettle us and make us uneasy. For \nmost want to live in harmony with others, and that includes the civil \nmajority that legislates. But when laws impinge on religious freedom \nand aspects of conscience, what then? Or is it being overly \nindividualistic to insist on having one's own religious liberty at \nthe presumed expense of societal compliance and conformity?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is easy to see how quickly religious freedom questions coupled \nwith civil disobedience can be seen as antigovernment and \nunpatriotic, with adherents being termed rebels and traitors.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the sacrifice of liberty, especially religious liberty, rips the \nsoul from the human heart.  Meeting violence with violence is not the \nanswer.  For in the words of Jesus, we are called to seek first the \nkingdom of God, not the kingdoms of this world.\u0014",

U.S. culture has some \nanswers\u0014\n                      ready. \"Quality time with your kids\" is the \nanswer for parents.\u0014\n                      An exercise machine that reduces stress and \nburns off fat in\u0014\n                      only 20 minutes, three times a week, is the \nanswer for the\u0014\n                      overwrought and the overweight. \"What you need \nis a good\u0014\n                      night's sleep or a vacation\" is the answer one \nfriend offers to\u0014\n                      another. Each of these answers has value. Yet \nour\u0014\n                      circumstances require a stronger response, and \nwe are too\u0014\n                      caught up in the swirl of our lives to devise \none. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In this situation, the historic practice of \nsetting aside one day\u0014\n                      a week for rest and worship promises peace to \nthose who\u0014\n                      embrace it. Whether we know the term Sabbath or \nnot, we\u0014\n                      the harried citizens of late modernity yearn \nfor the reality. We\u0014\n                      need Sabbath, even though we doubt that we have \ntime for it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the new century dawns, the practice of \nSabbath keeping\u0014\n                      may be a gift waiting to be unwrapped, a \nconfirmation that we\u0014\n                      are not without help in shaping the renewing \nways of life for\u0014\n                      which we long. This practice stands at the \nheart of Judaism,\u0014\n                      but it is also available to Christians. For \nmany of us, receiving\u0014\n                      this gift will require first discarding our \nimage of Sabbath as a\u0014\n                      time of negative rules and restrictions, as a \nday of obligation\u0014\n                      (for Catholics) or a day without play (in \nmemories of strict\u0014\n                      Protestant childhoods). Relocating our \nunderstanding of this\u0014\n                      day in the biblical stories of Creation, \nExodus, and\u0014\n                      Resurrection will be essential if we are to \ndiscover the gifts it\u0014\n                      offers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unwrapping this gift also requires supporting \nunderworked\u0014\n                      Americans as they wonder what Sabbath keeping \nmight\u0014\n                      mean for them. One of the cruelest features of \nthe American\u0014\n                      economy, which asks too much of many people, is \nthat it\u0014\n                      casts numerous others aside, leaving them \nwithout sufficient\u0014\n                      work. A Sabbath-keeping community would be a \ncommunity\u0014\n                      in which this injustice would not occur. When \nSabbath\u0014\n                      comes, commerce halts, feasts are served, and \nall God's\u0014\n                      children play. The equal reliance of all people \non the bounty\u0014\n                      and grace of God is gratefully acknowledged, \nand the\u0014\n                      goodness of weekday work is affirmed. \nRelationships that\u0014\n                      persist throughout the week are changed in the \nprocess. As\u0014\n                      the great Jewish scholar Abraham Joshua Heschel \nsaid, \"The\u0014\n                      Sabbath cannot survive in exile, a lonely \nstranger among days\u0014\n                      of profanity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      THE SABBATH RHYTHM\u0014\n                      The way in which time is organized is a \nfundamental building\u0014\n                      block of any community. So basic is this that \nmost of us take\u0014\n                      the pattern we are used to for granted, as if \nit were\u0014\n                      self-evident that time must be arranged in this \nway. For all the\u0014\n                      spiritual descendants of AbrahamJews, \nChristians,\u0014\n                      Muslimstime flows in seven-day cycles. Other \ncultures\u0014\n                      move through time in different cycles, however. \nIn most\u0014\n                      ancient societies, rest days followed lunar \nphases or rotated\u0014\n                      on some number other than seven. During the \nFrench\u0014\n                      Revolution, anti-Christian leaders tried to \nweaken popular\u0014\n                      religious traditions by abolishing the \nseven-day week. The\u0014\n                      rhythms of the week subtly pattern the days and \nyears of our\u0014\n                      lives, and they are filled with meaning. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Sabbatarian patternsix days of work, \nfollowed by one of\u0014\n                      restis woven deep into the fabric of the \nBible. The very first\u0014\n                      story of Hebrew and Christian Scriptures \nclimaxes on the\u0014\n                      seventh day, the very first time there was a \nseventh day.\u0014\n                      Having created everything, God rests, blesses \nthis day, and\u0014\n                      makes it holy. In this way, Karl Barth has \nsuggested, God\u0014\n                      declares as fully as possible just how very \ngood creation is.\u0014\n                      Resting, God takes pleasure in what has been \nmade; God\u0014\n                      has no regrets, no need to go on to create a \nstill better world\u0014\n                      or a creature more wonderful than the man and \nwoman. In the\u0014\n                      day of rest, God's free love toward humanity \ntakes form as\u0014\n                      time shared with them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Later, God teaches the people of Israel to \nshare in the\u0014\n                      blessing of this day (Exod. 16). After bringing \nthem out of\u0014\n                      Egyptian slavery into the wilderness, God sends \nthem\u0014\n                      manna, commanding them to gather enough each \nmorning for\u0014\n                      that day's food alone. Mistrusting, they gather \nmore than they\u0014\n                      need, but it rots. On the sixth day, however, \nthey are told to\u0014\n                      gather enough to last for two days. \nMiraculously, the extra\u0014\n                      does not rot, and those mistrustful ones who go \nout on the\u0014\n                      seventh morning to get more find none. God is \nteaching them,\u0014\n                      through their own hunger and nature's \nprovisions, to keep the\u0014\n                      Sabbath, even before Moses receives the \ncommandments on\u0014\n                      Sinai. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When those commandments come, the Sabbath\u0014\n                      commandment is the longest and in some ways the \nmost\u0014\n                      puzzling. Unlike any of the others, it takes \nquite different\u0014\n                      forms in the two passages where the Ten \nCommandments\u0014\n                      appear. Both versions require the same \nbehaviorwork on six\u0014\n                      days, rest on onebut each gives a different \nreason. What is\u0014\n                      wonderful is that each reason arises from a \nfundamental truth\u0014\n                      about God's relationship to humanity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Exodus commandment to \"remember\" the \nSabbath day\u0014\n                      is grounded in the story of Creation. The human \npattern of six\u0014\n                      days of work and one of rest follows God's \npattern as Creator;\u0014\n                      God's people are to rest on one day because God \ndid. In both\u0014\n                      work and rest, human beings are in the image of \nGod. At the\u0014\n                      same time, they are not God but God's \ncreatures, who must\u0014\n                      honor God by obeying this commandment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Deuteronomy, the commandment to \"observe\" \nthe Sabbath\u0014\n                      day is tied to the experience of a people newly \nreleased from\u0014\n                      bondage. Slaves cannot take a day off; free \npeople can.\u0014\n                      When they stop work every seventh day, the \npeople will\u0014\n                      remember that the Lord brought them out of \nslavery, and they\u0014\n                      will see to it that no one within their own \ndominion, not even\u0014\n                      animals, will work without respite. Sabbath \nrest is a recurring\u0014\n                      testimony against the drudgery of slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Together, these two renderings of the Sabbath \ncommandment\u0014\n                      summarize the most fundamental stories and \nbeliefs of the\u0014\n                      Hebrew Scriptures: Creation and Exodus, \nhumanity in God's\u0014\n                      image, and a people liberated from captivity. \nOne emphasizes\u0014\n                      holiness, the other social justice. Sabbath \ncrystallizes\u0014\n                      Torah's portrait of who God is and what human \nbeings are\u0014\n                      most fully meant to be. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      LETTING NATURE BE\u0014\n                      As Sabbath crystallizes Torah, so \nSabbathShabbatis the\u0014\n                      heart of Judaism. When Jews who have become \ninattentive to\u0014\n                      their religion wish to deepen their observance, \nrabbis tell them\u0014\n                      with one voice: You must begin by keeping \nShabbat. But\u0014\n                      what does it mean to keep a day holy, to \nrefrain from work, to\u0014\n                      honor God's creativity and imitate God's rest, \nto experience\u0014\n                      the end of bondage? This question has been on \nthe minds of\u0014\n                      observant Jews, and in their hearts and \nactions, for millennia.\u0014\n                      Following Exodus 31, in which God makes the \nSabbath the\u0014\n                      sign of an irrevocable covenant with the people \nof Israel,\u0014\n                      Jewish leaders have emphasized its special \nplace in Jewish\u0014\n                      life and heard in its rhythm the structure that \nhas kept Jewish\u0014\n                      identity alive amid terrible adversity. A \nsaying affirms that\u0014\n                      \"more than the Jews have kept Shabbat, Shabbat \nhas kept\u0014\n                      the Jews.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many centuries of debate and cultural change \nhave shaped\u0014\n                      the law and liturgy of contemporary Shabbat \nobservance,\u0014\n                      which varies considerably from one branch of \nJudaism to\u0014\n                      another. Infusing the practice as a whole, \nhowever, is a\u0014\n                      theology of Creation and Exodus, of holiness \nand liberation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In observant Jewish homes, Shabbat begins each \nFriday\u0014\n                      night at sundown as a woman lights the Sabbath \ncandles. It\u0014\n                      is a festive time; people dress up, the best \ntableware and food\u0014\n                      are presented, guests are welcomed. In some \nfamilies,\u0014\n                      everyone turns toward the door, singing to \ngreet Shabbat,\u0014\n                      which Jewish hymns personify as a loving bride \nwho brings\u0014\n                      inner delight and as a beautiful queen who \ngives order and\u0014\n                      peace. Traditional prayers are prayers of \nthanks; indeed,\u0014\n                      mourning is suspended in Shabbat liturgies. \nMany families\u0014\n                      sing or read together after the meal. They will \ngather again the\u0014\n                      next evening for another meal at which they \nwill bid farewell to\u0014\n                      the holy day. Finally, parents will bless their \nchildren and give\u0014\n                      them a bit of sweet spice so that the taste of \nSabbath peace\u0014\n                      will linger on their tongues. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jewish liturgy and law say both what should be \ndone on\u0014\n                      Shabbat and what should not. What should not be \ndone is\u0014\n                      \"work.\" Defining exactly what that means is a \nlong and\u0014\n                      continuing argument, but one classic answer is \nthat work is\u0014\n                      whatever requires changing the natural, \nmaterial world. All\u0014\n                      week long, human beings wrestle with the \nnatural world, tilling\u0014\n                      and hammering and carrying and burning. On the \nSabbath,\u0014\n                      however, Jews let it be. They celebrate it as \nit is and live in it\u0014\n                      in peace and gratitude. Humans are created too, \nafter all, and\u0014\n                      in gratefully receiving the gift of the world, \nthey learn to\u0014\n                      remember that it is not, finally, human effort \nthat grows the\u0014\n                      grain and forges the steel. By extension, all \nactivities\u0014\n                      associated with work or commerce are also \nprohibited. You\u0014\n                      are not even supposed to think about them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What should be done? Specific religious duties \ndo exist,\u0014\n                      including worship at synagogue and reading of \nthe Torah. But\u0014\n                      the holiness of the Sabbath is also made \nmanifest in the joy\u0014\n                      people expect to experience on that day. It is \na good deed for\u0014\n                      married couples to have sexual intercourse on \nShabbat.\u0014\n                      Taking a walk, resting, talking with loved ones,\u0014\n                      readingthese are good, too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To the eyes of outsiders, Jewish observance of \nthe Sabbath\u0014\n                      can seem like a dreary set of restrictions, a \nset of laws that\u0014\n                      don't bear any good news. According to those \nwho live each\u0014\n                      week shaped by Shabbat, however, it is a \npractice that\u0014\n                      powerfully alters their relationships to \nnature, work, God, and\u0014\n                      others. Shabbat is not just law and liturgy; it \nis also a shared\u0014\n                      way of life, a set of activities that becomes \nsecond nature, a\u0014\n                      round of custom and prayer that the youngest \nchild or the\u0014\n                      oldest person can enter, a piece of time that \nopens space for\u0014\n                      God. Over and over, Jewish authors say of \nShabbat what\u0014\n                      those who enter deeply into other religious \npractices also\u0014\n                      say: to experience its goodness, you must enter \nits activities.\u0014\n                      To find Sabbath peace, you must keep the \nSabbath holy.\u0014\n                      \"The real and the spiritual are one, like body \nand soul in a\u0014\n                      living person,\" writes Heschel. \"It is for the \nlaw to clear the\u0014\n                      path; it is for the soul to sense the spirit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      SABBATH KEEPING IN A CHRISTIAN KEY\u0014\n                      Christians are fortunate when Jewish friends \ninvite us to come\u0014\n                      to a meal on a Friday evening, to keep Sabbath \nwith them.\u0014\n                      On our own, however, Christians cannot keep \nSabbath as\u0014\n                      Jews do. We know God most fully not through the \nperpetual\u0014\n                      covenant God made with the Israelites at Sinai \nbut through\u0014\n                      Jesus Christ. Yet we also honor the Mosaic \nCommandments,\u0014\n                      and we stand in spiritual and historical \nkinship with the\u0014\n                      Jewish people, of whom Jesus was one. In an \nauthentically\u0014\n                      Christian form of Sabbath keeping, we may \naffirm the grateful\u0014\n                      relationship to the Creator that Jews celebrate \neach Sabbath,\u0014\n                      and we may share the joyful liberation from \ndrudgery first\u0014\n                      experienced by the slaves who left Egypt. But \nwe add to\u0014\n                      these celebrations our weekly festival for the \nsource of our\u0014\n                      greatest joy: Christ's victory over the powers \nof death. For\u0014\n                      Christians, this victory makes of each weekly \nday of rest and\u0014\n                      worship a celebration of Easter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The first day of the week was special to \nChristians as an\u0014\n                      Easter day from the earliest days of their \ncommunity.\u0014\n                      Sunday, the day on which the disciples had \nfirst encountered\u0014\n                      the risen Lord, became a day to gather, eat \ntogether, and\u0014\n                      rejoice. It was not in those years a day of \nrest, however;\u0014\n                      these gatherings happened after the workday was \nover, and\u0014\n                      for several decades, Jews who became Christians \ncontinued\u0014\n                      to observe Shabbat as well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But these were years when Sabbath observance was\u0014\n                      changing for Jews as well as for Christians. \nAfter the temple\u0014\n                      in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in the \nyear 70,\u0014\n                      the rabbis who reformulated Jewish practice for \nthe new\u0014\n                      situation placed great emphasis on the Sabbath \nas a lasting\u0014\n                      sign of God's unique covenant with Israel. So \nJewish\u0014\n                      observance was becoming more strict during this \nperiod. At\u0014\n                      the same time, Christianity was developing a \nseparate\u0014\n                      identity from Judaism, and many people who were \nnot Jewish\u0014\n                      were joining the church. Gradually, Christians \nof Jewish\u0014\n                      background stopped attending synagogue and \nobserving\u0014\n                      Jewish law. Over the years, Sunday became their\u0014\n                      one-day-in-seven for both rest and worship. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Gospels say that Jesus observed the Jewish \nSabbath,\u0014\n                      though he ignored some laws that other teachers \nthought\u0014\n                      should restrict healing or eating in specific \nsituations of need.\u0014\n                      \"It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath,\" Jesus \nsays (Matt.\u0014\n                      12:12). Later, Christians continued to treasure \nthe Sabbath\u0014\n                      commandment, along with the other nine \ncommandments\u0014\n                      from Sinai. They also came to believe, however, \nthat its\u0014\n                      meaning had changed within the new creation God \nbegan with\u0014\n                      Christ's death and resurrection. The holy day \nfrom now on,\u0014\n                      therefore, was not the seventh but the \n\"eighth,\" the day on\u0014\n                      which the future burst into the present. The \nappropriate\u0014\n                      response was to celebrate each Sunday with a \nfeast of\u0014\n                      Communion, looking back to Jesus' passion and \nresurrection\u0014\n                      and forward to the great banquet that would \noccur at the end\u0014\n                      of time. The result has been centuries of \nSunday worship,\u0014\n                      usually crowned by the celebration of the \nLord's Supper. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Building on this shared heritage, different \ngroups of Christians\u0014\n                      have shaped Sabbath keeping in different ways. \nThe strict\u0014\n                      Sabbath observance of the New England Puritans, \nwhich gave\u0014\n                      rise to \"blue laws\" in many American cities and \ntowns,\u0014\n                      influenced the structure of time for many \ngroups in this\u0014\n                      society. Reformed churches of Dutch origin have \nanchored an\u0014\n                      American subculture within which Sundays are \nstill filled with\u0014\n                      family visits and theological debate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the other hand, some groups have been \nsuspicious of\u0014\n                      Sabbatarianism so strict that it might seem \nlegalistic (\"If\u0014\n                      anywhere the day is made holy for the mere \nday's sake, then\u0014\n                      I order you to work on it, to ride on it, to \nfeast on it, to do\u0014\n                      anything to remove this reproach from Christian \nliberty,\"\u0014\n                      Martin Luther declared) or have emphasized, \nlike the\u0014\n                      Quakers, that all time is holy with God. Sunday \nmass has\u0014\n                      been and continues to be central to Roman \nCatholics. A few\u0014\n                      groups, including the Seventh-day Adventists, \nhave made\u0014\n                      Saturday observance central to their identity. \u0014\n\u0014\nRediscovering the Sabbath (Part 2 of 2) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      CLEARING THE ROADBLOCKS\u0014\n                      Even while the Bible, history, and the example \nof Judaism stir\u0014\n                      up a yearning for Sabbath within us, we are \naware that taking\u0014\n                      on a Sabbath rhythm would not be easyand \npressures to\u0014\n                      work and spend are only part of the problem. \nSome other\u0014\n                      obstacles also make it difficult to retrieve \nthis practice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One is figuring out how to make Sunday special \nwhen it is no\u0014\n                      longer protected by legislation and custom. The \narrangement\u0014\n                      of time by society as a whole is political, of \ncourse: how time\u0014\n                      is structured makes someone's life easier and \nsomeone's\u0014\n                      harder. Sunday first received special \ngovernmental recognition\u0014\n                      in 321, when the emperor Constantine decreed it \na day of rest\u0014\n                      throughout the Roman Empire. This spawned \ncenturies of\u0014\n                      government-sponsored Sabbath keeping. In recent \ndecades,\u0014\n                      however, the setting aside of Sunday as a \nspecial day has\u0014\n                      been losing force within American culture's \npolitics of time.\u0014\n                      One reason is increasing sensitivity to \nreligious diversitya\u0014\n                      sensitivity pioneered by the Supreme Court in \ndecisions that\u0014\n                      forced employers to respect the Sabbath \npractices of Jews\u0014\n                      and Adventists. Today, not only the laws but \nalso the\u0014\n                      customs that once shielded Sunday from most \ncommerce are\u0014\n                      disappearing, and Christians' day of worship \nand rest is not\u0014\n                      automatically \"free\" for church and family. \nClaiming its\u0014\n                      freedom will take effort and perhaps even \nsacrifice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A second roadblock is the bad reputation many \ndevout\u0014\n                      Christians have given to the day of rest and \nworship. In the\u0014\n                      centuries after Constantine, church attendance \ncame to be\u0014\n                      required and profane activity to be banned on \nSundays,\u0014\n                      though in fact these rules were often ignored. \nWhen religious\u0014\n                      reform swept through Europe in the sixteenth \ncentury,\u0014\n                      improving the people's use of their day of rest \nwas a concern\u0014\n                      of Protestant and Catholic leaders alike. In \nthe ensuing\u0014\n                      centuries, some Protestants worldwide not only \nrequired\u0014\n                      many hours of worship services each Sunday, but \nalso made\u0014\n                      it virtually impossible for absentees to have \nany fun. Sabbath\u0014\n                      keepers were killjoys, it seemed. Little wonder \nthat gloom still\u0014\n                      hangs over the Sunday memories of some from more\u0014\n                      stringent times. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today, economic forces are also nibbling away \nat the freedom\u0014\n                      of the day. In a vicious circle, people who \nspend more hours\u0014\n                      at weekday jobs need the other days for \nshopping, which\u0014\n                      prompts businesses to hire more Sunday workers, \nwho join\u0014\n                      the growing percentage of the workforce who \ntoil long,\u0014\n                      irregular hours, some trying desperately to \nmake ends meet,\u0014\n                      others for the sake of more shopping. For \nmillions of workers,\u0014\n                      long Sunday hours for rest and worship may be \nimpossible\u0014\n                      within the current system. People who know the \nSabbath\u0014\n                      pattern of creation, liberation, and \nresurrection nurture a\u0014\n                      dissatisfaction with this system, however, and \ncan work for\u0014\n                      change. Keeping Sabbath, we grow in our longing \nfor a\u0014\n                      system where all people have work at a living \nwage, and time\u0014\n                      for rest and worship too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Will it be possible for twenty-first-century \nChristians who need\u0014\n                      Sabbath but also respect diversity, who need \nSabbath but\u0014\n                      also yearn for joy, who need Sabbath but also \nstruggle to\u0014\n                      make ends meet to enter the practice of Sabbath \nkeeping?\u0014\n                      Perhaps. But this can only happen as we help \none another\u0014\n                      develop new forms rooted in the enduring truths \nof Creation,\u0014\n                      liberation, and Resurrection. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      UNWRAPPING THE GIFT OF SABBATH\u0014\n                      In our situation, Sabbath keeping will require \na good deal of\u0014\n                      inventiveness. Tilden Edwards, an Episcopal \npriest who has\u0014\n                      explored this practice in real life and in a \nbook, urges\u0014\n                      contemporary Christians to be flexible, \nembracing not a\u0014\n                      renewed Sabbatarianism as much as a pattern of \n\"Sabbath\u0014\n                      time.\" He recommends a combination of Sunday \nworship and\u0014\n                      play with a regular rhythm of disciplined \nspiritual renewal\u0014\n                      during the week. Eugene Peterson, a \nPresbyterian minister,\u0014\n                      describes the \"Sabbaths\" he and his wife \nobserved every\u0014\n                      Monday, after their busiest day was over: a \ndrive to the\u0014\n                      country, a psalm, a silent hike for several \nhours, a quiet\u0014\n                      evening at home. Pastors are not the only ones \nwho must\u0014\n                      work on Sundays; others, too, sometimes need to \nfind ways\u0014\n                      of keeping Sabbath on other days. Yet none of \nus should\u0014\n                      think that we can sustain Sabbath keeping, \nwhenever it\u0014\n                      happens, all by ourselves. We need mutuality in \nthis practice,\u0014\n                      which resists our ordinary patterns in so many \nways. We\u0014\n                      need to help one another discover this gift. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most often, Sundays will make the best \nSabbaths, and not\u0014\n                      only because our schedules are relatively open \non that day.\u0014\n                      Joining the assembly of Christians for the \ncelebration of Word\u0014\n                      and sacrament will remind us that Sabbath \nkeeping is not\u0014\n                      about taking a day off but about being recalled \nto our\u0014\n                      knowledge of and gratitude for God's activity \nin creating the\u0014\n                      world, giving liberty to captives, and \novercoming the powers of\u0014\n                      death. In addition, the friends with whom we \nworship can help\u0014\n                      us learn to rest and rejoice once the service \nis over. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What, besides churchgoing, is Christian Sabbath \nkeeping?\u0014\n                      The answer must be tailored to specific \ncircumstances and\u0014\n                      will vary considerably in different cultures \nand stages of life. It\u0014\n                      will be helpful in each circumstance to reflect \non what is good\u0014\n                      and what is not. What is not good on Sabbath, \nor in Sabbath\u0014\n                      time? We would do well to heed three millennia \nof Jewish\u0014\n                      reflection on the Sabbath commandment. Not good \nare work\u0014\n                      and commerce and worry. To act as if the world \ncannot get\u0014\n                      along without our work for one day in seven is \na startling\u0014\n                      display of pride that denies the sufficiency of \nour generous\u0014\n                      Maker. To refrain from workingnot every day, \nbut one in\u0014\n                      sevenopens the temporal space within which \nglad and\u0014\n                      grateful relationship with God and peaceful and \nappreciative\u0014\n                      relationship with nature and other people can \ngrow. Refraining\u0014\n                      from work on a regular basis should also teach \nus not to\u0014\n                      demand excessive work from others. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What about commerce? Buying and spending are \nclosely\u0014\n                      related to working too much; they depend on \nwork, create the\u0014\n                      conditions for more work, and often are work. \nWe could refrain\u0014\n                      from shopping on Sundays, making a choice that \nmight\u0014\n                      complicate the weekly schedule at first but \nshould soon\u0014\n                      become a refreshing habit. And worry? It may be \ndifficult to\u0014\n                      banish cares from our minds altogether, but we \ncan refrain\u0014\n                      from activities that we know will summon \nworryactivities like\u0014\n                      paying bills, preparing tax returns, and making \nlists of things\u0014\n                      to do in the coming week. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And what is good on a Christian Sabbath? Most \nimportant is\u0014\n                      joyful worship that restores us to communion \nwith the risen\u0014\n                      Christ and our fellow members of his body, the \nchurch. For\u0014\n                      Christians, every Sunday is Easter Sunday, a \ntime to gather\u0014\n                      together with song and prayer, to hear the Word \nproclaimed,\u0014\n                      and to recognize Christ in the breaking of the \nbread. It is a\u0014\n                      festival, a spring of souls, a day of freedom \nnot only from work\u0014\n                      but also from condemnation. At times, worshiping\u0014\n                      communities lose sight of this: hymns drag, \nelders judge,\u0014\n                      children fidget, fancy clothes constrain, and \nthe minutes tick\u0014\n                      slowly by.

Born in Virginia's Westmoreland \nCounty on January 19, 1807,\u0014\n                              the third son of Henry (\"Light Horse \nHarry\") and Ann Hill Carter Lee.\u0014\n                              Declining fortunes forced the family's \nremoval to Alexandria, where\u0014\n                              Robert distinguished himself in local \nschools. His father's death in\u0014\n                              1811 increased responsibilities on all \nthe sons; Robert, especially,\u0014\n                              cared for his invalid mother. \u0014\n\u0014\n                              Lee graduated number two in his class \nfrom the U.S. Military\u0014\n                              Academy in 1829. Commissioned a brevet \nlieutenant of engineers,\u0014\n                              he spent a few years at Fort Pulaski, \nGeorgia, and Fort Monroe,\u0014\n                              Virginia. At Fort Monroe on June 30, \n1831, he married Mary Ann\u0014\n                              Randolph Custis, with whom he had seven \nchildren. Lee worked in\u0014\n     the chief engineer's office in Washington, D.C., from 1834 to \n1837. He was transferred to Fort\u0014\n     Hamilton, New York, where he remained until 1846. \u0014\n\u0014\n     In August 1846 Lee joined General John E. Wool's army in Texas. \nIn the battle of Buena Vista, Lee's boldness drew his superiors' \nattention. Transferred to General Winfield Scott's Veracruz \nexpedition, in the battle at Veracruz and in the advance on Mexico he \nwon additional acclaim. Following American occupation of the Mexican \ncapital, he worked on maps for possible future campaigns. Already a \ncaptain in the regular service, he was made brevet colonel for his \ngallantry in the war. Lee returned to engineer duty at Baltimore's \nFort Carroll until 1852, when he reluctantly became superintendent of \nthe Military Academy at West Point. In 1855 he was made lieutenant \ncolonel of the 2nd Cavalry, one of the Army's elite units. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The years 1857-1859 were bleak. Lee had to take several \nfurloughs to deal with family business and seriously thought of \nresigning his commission. However, in 1859 he and his men \nsuccessfully put  down John Brown's insurrection at Harpers Ferry, \nVirginia. In 1860 he became commander of the Department of Texas. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Talk of secession in the South grew strident during Lee's Texas \nsojourn. No secessionist, he was loyal to the Union and the U.S. \nArmy; yet he had no doubts about his loyalties if Virginia departed \nthe Union. Ties of blood bound him to the South. Lee accepted a \ncommission as colonel of the 1st U.S. Cavalry in March 1861. But \noffered command of the entire U.S. Army a month later, he hesitated. \nIf he accepted, he might have to lead the Federal Army against \nSouthern states and, if Virginia seceded, he might have to lead \ntroops across its borders. He could do neither. Painfully, Lee \nresigned his army commission in April 1861. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Appointed commander of Virginia forces, Lee devoted himself to \nbuilding an effective state army. He was so efficient that the new \npresident of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, asked him to become a \nfull general in the Confederate Army and serve as presidential \nmilitary adviser. The Confederate Senate confirmed this appointment. \u0014\n\u0014\n     A bad brush with field command in western Virginiain a campaign \nmarked by military rivalries, lack of supplies, wretched weather, and \noverly ambitious strategy on Lee's parttarnished the new  general's \nreputation. Davis still regarded him highly and sent him to organize \nsouthern Atlantic coastal defenses. Lee pursued this task efficiently \nuntil recalled to the Confederate capital, Richmond. In his role as \npresidential adviser, he tried to smooth the abrasive personalities \nof Davis and General Joseph E. Johnston and to utilize the daring of \nGeneral Stonewall Jackson to frustrate Federal plans for sending aid \nto General George B. McClellan's army, which was approaching \nRichmond. \u0014\n\u0014\n     When Johnston was wounded in May 1862, Davis gave Lee command of \nJohnston's army. Lee renamed his force the \"Army of Northern \nVirginia.\" The new commander looked the part: 5 feet 10 1/2 inches \ntall, robust at 170 pounds, Lee had graceful, almost classic \nfeatures. He attracted men and women alike, was easy in manner, \ncourteous and kind as a friend, and was a loving husband and father. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Though Lee's was the largest Confederate army in the field, it \nwas outnumbered almost three to two by McClellan's Federal Army of \nthe Potomac, which was preparing for siege operations on Richmond. \nWhile Lee struggled to fortify Richmond, he and Jackson planned a \ndaring campaign, which Stonewall executed brilliantly and \nvictoriously in the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic, June \n8-9, 1862.Lee promptly called Jackson to Richmond and added his \n18,000-man force to the Army of Northern Virginia. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Inexperience and haste led Lee to plan an overelaborate attack \non McClellan's lines. Coordination failed, as Lee's campaign \nstuttered onward in a series of actions. McClellan was defeated in \nthe Seven Days Battles and finally retreated to the Federal gunboats \non the James River. Richmond was freed of  threat, but Lee's planned \nannihilation of the Federal force had failed. Lee was unhappy with \nhis results; but his men, almost completely rearmed with superior \nFederal arms, had developed great confidence in him. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Meanwhile another Federal army appeared in Virginia under \nGeneral John Pope. Lee sent Stonewall Jackson against Pope early in \nAugust. Jackson defeated part of Pope's force, then joined Lee for a \ncombined campaign to destroy the rest. Lee planned more simply this \ntime. Jackson captured Pope's supply base at Manassas Junction. Near \nthe battlefield of First Manassas (Bull Run), Jackson stood off \nPope's entire army while Lee's remaining force under General James \nLongstreet concentrated close to Jackson's lines. On August 30 a \nsweeping assault by all Confederate troops won the Battle of Second \nManassas. Lee had hoped for annihilation, but Pope's remnants \nescaped. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Lee's army could not subsist in war-ravaged northern Virginia, \nso he determined to carry the war into the North. With Virginia \ncleared of invaders and his army's morale superb, this seemed a \nlikely time to force European recognition of the South by threatening \nWashington, D.C., and changing the locale of the war. In a campaign \ndistinguished for daringLee broke his army into segments, each with \na specific taskhe crossed the Potomac River and reached Frederick, \nMaryland, sending Jackson's men to capture Harpers Ferry and open a \nsupply route through the Shenandoah Valley. However, McClellan, \nrestored to Federal command, was fighting with unexpected skill. Lee \nsought to concentrate his scattered men near Sharpsburg, Maryland, \nbehind Antietam Creek. There on September 17, 1862, with badly \nreduced strength he withstood searing assault; the arrival of \nGeneral  A. P. Hill's division saved him from defeat. Several lessons \nhad been learned, but Lee had lost 13,000 men in Maryland, and \nreplacements were the scarcest commodity in the Confederacy. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Reorganizing his forces occupied Lee until December 13, when his \nmen, holding high and virtually impregnable ground overlooking \nFredericksburg, Virginia, beat off gallant attacks by the Army of the \nPotomac (now commanded by General Ambrose Burnside). During the rest \nof the winter Lee tried to increase ranks and supplies. Jackson and \nLongstreet, his two corps commanders, improved their commands, new \nmen were elevated to leadership, and Lee's army was ready by the time \na new Federal general, Joseph Hooker, started his campaign in April \n1863. Jackson clashed with Hooker in Virginia's Wilderness at the end \nof April. When Hooker withdrew to entrenchments near \nChancellorsville, the initiative passed to Lee. He sent Jackson to a \nflanking position from which he almost destroyed Hooker's force. \nJackson might have completed the destruction had he not been wounded, \nand his death later robbed the victory of any savor as the whole \nConfederacy mourned. Lee mourned especially, for there were no \nofficers to match Jackson. With the initiative in his grasp, Lee had \nto decide how to use his army. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Vicksburg, Mississippi, the South's last bastion on the \nMississippi River, was under siege; its loss would cut the South in \ntwo. Food supplies in northern Virginia were scarce. However, \nEuropeans were becoming convinced of the South's right to \nrecognition, and peace sentiment was growing in the North. All these \nfactors influenced Lee's summer strategy. Another invasion of the \nNorth might relieve Vicksburg, feed his men, and win recognition. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Lee reorganized his army into three corps: one under Longstreet, \na second under Richard S. Ewell, and the third under Hill. \nSubordinate commands were shaken up, so a new command structure \nguided the Confederate Army as it moved toward Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania. Lee's vanguard encountered opposition near Gettysburg \nand on July 1 won modest spoils. Lee wanted to push the advantage. \nBut Ewell delayed, and the next day Longstreet, convinced of defeat, \nalso delayed attacking the Federal leFort On July 3, General George \nPickett charged against the Federal center and was repulsed. For the \nfirst time Lee's army had been defeated, and Lee assumed all blame. \nQuestions still arise over why he ordered the attack on July 3. But \nLee seems to have had no choice. To miss this chance would have been \na miserable compromise. Typically, he did not lament for long; \ninstead, he planned to refit his army and renew the offensive. But \nthe loss of 20,000 men and as many arms was unrecoverable. \nVicksburg's loss, with a 30,000-man garrison, on July 4 confronted \nthe South with a double disaster in men and supplies. Lee could not \nresume the offensive; his army was divided, with\u0014\nLongstreet moving west to help General Braxton Bragg and the rest \ncommitted to holding Richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Lee maneuvered against General George Meade throughout the \nremainder of 1863, and in spring 1864 he met the advance of Meade and \nUlysses S. Grant. A series of bloody engagements followed. On June 3 \nat Cold Harbor the Federal assault on Lee's entrenchments was \nrepulsed. Meade and Grant moved south of the James River, hoping to \ntake Petersburg and enter Richmond from the south.\u0014\n\u0014\n     General P. G. T. Beauregard saved Petersburg, with help from \nLee. The formal siege of Petersburg ran from June 18, 1864, to April \n2, 1865. In those months, attrition cut Lee's ranks. Daily casualties \nand desertion whittled down his strength; dwindling food for men and \nanimals almost immobilized the army. Heavy actions through the \nsummer, combined with the necessity of keeping Richmond's southern \nrail connections open, sapped Lee's resources. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The Confederacy's military situation worsened throughout the \nsummer as Federal general William T. Sherman forced the Army of \nTennessee backward through Georgia to the sea. Lee, appointed general \nin chief of all Confederate armies in February 1865, could give only \ngeneral direction to lingering disaster.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Sherman marched upward through the Carolinas, threatening \nPetersburg. Lee failed to split Grant's front. On April 2, Grant's \nattack snapped Lee's lines; the Confederates began evacuating \nPetersburg and Richmond. Lee was compelled to surrender his shadow \nforce of no more than 9,000 soldiers at Appomattox on April 9, 1865. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Arlington, the Custis family seat, was gone now; the Lees had no \nreal home. They remained in Richmond, well treated by the Federals. \nIn September Lee accepted the presidency of Washington College, in \nLexington, Virginia, where he remained until his death.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Devoted to education and to resurrecting the South, Lee became a \nsymbol of reunification. He refused to abandon his distressed \ncountry, hoped for Southern reassimilation, and set a lofty example. \nWithout bitterness, he obeyed the law and counseled all Southerners \nto do the same. Indicted for treason, he never stood trial; and \nalthough never granted a pardon, he lived in comfort and in great \nhonor. In September 1870 he was stricken, probably with an acute \nattack of angina, and died on October 12. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Biography Resource Center,  2000 Gale Group\u0014",

Dyrness, \nof Fuller\u0014\n                      Theological Seminary, has written Learning \nAbout Theology\u0014\n                      from the Third World and other books.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rethinking \"Reached\" Nations\u0014\n                      The authors call for a \"gracious revolution\" in \nmissions,\u0014\n                      warning of dire consequences for those who fail \nto climb\u0014\n                      aboard the postmodern bandwagon. \"When the Great\u0014\n                      Commission is properly conceived as making \ndisciples, it\u0014\n                      should then become apparent that \ndisciple-making is a\u0014\n                      process that will continue until Christ \nreturns,\" they write. \"In\u0014\n                      other words, the Great Commission can never be \nfulfilled,\u0014\n                      and we are doing a great disservice when we \ndeclare any part\u0014\n                      of the world to have been reached\" (authors' \nemphases). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They are, of course, right about the slippery \ntopic of \"reached\"\u0014\n                      nations. According to Patrick Johnstone, only \n2.8 percent of\u0014\n                      the 515 million people of Europe, historically \na \"Christian\"\u0014\n                      continent, are evangelicals. Thus, if Europe \never was reached,\u0014\n                      it certainly is not now.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Or take Rwanda, where 80 percent of the people \nclaim to be\u0014\n                      Christian but where discipleship was little in \nevidence during\u0014\n                      the genocide of April 1994.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is much to commend Engel and Dyrness for \nin this\u0014\n                      book, although much of the content seems to be a\u0014\n                      restatement from earlier Engel works. They \nrightly caution\u0014\n                      churches and missions not to be seduced by a \nmodernistic\u0014\n                      mindset (although, curiously, they do not \ndisplay the same\u0014\n                      fear of postmodernism). They decry the West's \npenchant for\u0014\n                      \"managerial missiology,\" which for them boils \ndown to\u0014\n                      measuring spiritual outcomes, as the ad2000 and \nBeyond\u0014\n                      Movement has been accused of doing in its \neagerness to\u0014\n                      present the gospel to the approximately 1,500 \npeople groups\u0014\n                      considered unreached.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Overstating their case, however, they charge \nthat \"the\u0014\n                      redefinition of the Great Commission to a \nmeasurable\u0014\n                      objective of maximizing numbers of converts and \nchurch\u0014\n                      members has emasculated Christ's imperative to \nmake\u0014\n                      disciples in all nations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yes, the ad2000 Movement undoubtedly cut \ncorners in the\u0014\n                      race to meet its artificial deadline, but who \ncan fail to rejoice\u0014\n                      over the millions of people mobilized for world \nmissions and\u0014\n                      brought into Christ's kingdom as a result?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Changing the Mind of Missions could have used \nmore editing.\u0014\n                      The warmed-over and fictitious scenario of the \nenlightenment\u0014\n                      of Global Harvest Mission and First Church of \nRollingwood in\u0014\n                      abandoning the old missions paradigm in favor \nof the new\u0014\n                      adds nothing. A case study of real people and \norganizations\u0014\n                      would have been much more convincing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Engel and Dyrness argue that missions today \nmust be\u0014\n                      centered in the local church, saying the church \n\"is both the\u0014\n                      message and the medium expressing the fullness \nof the reign\u0014\n                      of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet this is not as easy as the authors imply. \nMissionaries,\u0014\n                      ideally, are sent to places where there is no \nchurch, and\u0014\n                      inexperienced churches that send people to \nthese areas\u0014\n                      without the help of experts do so at their \nperil. At the\u0014\n                      Lausanne Congress in 1974, Ralph Winter argued \nthat 2.7\u0014\n                      billion of the world's people could not be won \nto Christ by\u0014\n                      \"near-neighbor evangelism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In short, some areas simply do not have a \nChristian presence\u0014\n                      by which their inhabitants might be won to \nChrist. Thus,\u0014\n                      missionaries (even Western ones) are still \nneeded.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While rightly highlighting the key role of God \nin salvation,\u0014\n                      Engel and Dyrness seem to downplay the \ndifficulty of the\u0014\n                      task. \"In this kingdom paradigm of world \nmissions, those we\u0014\n                      consider to be unreached are not viewed as \ncandidates or\u0014\n                      customers for the gospel,\" they write. \"Rather, \nour objective is\u0014\n                      to invite others, believers and nonbelievers, \nto join us in a\u0014\n                      pilgrimage to discover the reality of a risen \nLord.\" Does this\u0014\n                      seem a viable approach to reach millions of \nresistant Hindus,\u0014\n                      Muslims, and Buddhists?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then again, Engel and Dyrness seem to be in no \nhurry. They\u0014\n                      say that \"The existence of a need in and of \nitself does not\u0014\n                      signify a call to ministry\" (authors' \nemphasis). Perhaps that is\u0014\n                      why the book makes no mention of the eternal \ndestiny of the\u0014\n                      lost, or why the authors advocate an \"eternal \ntimetable\" for\u0014\n                      setting ministry priorities, apparently \noverlooking Christ's\u0014\n                      command to pray for workers to be sent into a \nfield ready for\u0014\n                      harvest. Seeing a need may not determine one's \ncall, but it is\u0014\n                      often a critical element.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps this blind spot has occurred because \nthey have\u0014\n                      started on the wrong foot. Engel and Dyrness \nwrite that\u0014\n                      Jesus' words in Luke 4:18-19 (which quotes Isa. \n61:1-2)\u0014\n                      constitute his personal \"mission statement\":\u0014\n\u0014\n                           The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because \nhe has\u0014\n                           sent me to preach good news to the poor. He\u0014\n                           has sent me to proclaim freedom to the\u0014\n                           prisoners and recovery of sight to the \nblind, to\u0014\n                           release the oppressed, to proclaim the \nyear of\u0014\n                           the Lord's favor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"If this defines his agenda, it also must \ndefine ours,\" they\u0014\n                      write. Jesus clearly was concerned with \nphysical blindness,\u0014\n                      poverty, and imprisonment, but even more so \nwith their\u0014\n                      spiritual manifestations (see John 9:39). As \nAndreas\u0014\n                      Kostenberger demonstrated in The Missions of \nJesus and the\u0014\n                      Disciples According to the Fourth Gospel \n(Eerdmans, 1998),\u0014\n                      the Lord's followers are not necessarily called \nto do the same\u0014\n                      works he did. And is a socially slanted focus \non Luke 4:18-19\u0014\n                      really warranted, since \"preaching\" and \n\"proclaiming\" are\u0014\n                      integral parts of the text, and since Jesus \nhimself described\u0014\n                      the purpose of his coming in various ways (see, \nfor example,\u0014\n                      Mark 1:38, 10:45; Luke 19:10)?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Engel and Dyrness decry the \"specious \ndichotomy\" drawn\u0014\n                      today between evangelism and social \ntransformation,\u0014\n                      overlooking the many hospitals, orphanages, and\u0014\n                      microenterprise programs founded by \nmissionaries and\u0014\n                      evangelists down through the centuries. The \ngospel has been\u0014\n                      the greatest force for social transformation in \nthe history of\u0014\n                      the world. It was William Carey, the \"father of \nmodern\u0014\n                      missions,\" who two centuries ago translated the \nHindu\u0014\n                      classics, started India's first newspaper, and \nstood against\u0014\n                      the Hindu practice of sati, or widow-burning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Body and Soul\u0014\n                      Engel and Dyrness are correct in their call for \na stronger\u0014\n                      emphasis on discipleship. But they seemingly \ndismiss as an\u0014\n                      old, modernistic paradigm any understanding of \nmissions that\u0014\n                      gives evangelism first priority. The authors, \nhowever, say\u0014\n                      comparatively little about the apostle Paul, \nwhose primary\u0014\n                      focus was on preaching good news. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      No one will dispute that God calls us to love \nour neighbor in\u0014\n                      practical ways, but what could be more loving \nthan sharing\u0014\n                      news that can change a person's life, both now \nand for\u0014\n                      eternity?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus certainly would put evangelism ahead of \nsocial\u0014\n                      ministry, if a choice must be madeand he did. \nTo a crowd\u0014\n                      of people seeking a meal, he gave a sermon \ninstead (John 6).\u0014\n                      \"What good will it be for a man,\" he asked, \"if \nhe gains the\u0014\n                      whole world, yet forfeits his soul?\" (Matt. \n16:26a)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sometimes that painful choice between body and \nsoul must\u0014\n                      be made. Meredith Long of World Relief has \nacknowledged\u0014\n                      that evangelism can upset the trust that \ndevelopment\u0014\n                      professionals try to build when introducing \nprojects in\u0014\n                      non-Christian areas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"When a group of untouchables declare \nthemselves as\u0014\n                      followers of Christ, trust within the community \noften begins to\u0014\n                      dissipate, especially where conversion is a \nhighly charged\u0014\n                      political issue,\" Long says. In that case, \nthen, shouldn't the\u0014\n                      priority be on souls?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's not only what Engel and Dyrness say that \ncauses\u0014\n                      concern, but what they don't. Advocating their \n\"kingdom\u0014\n                      paradigm\" of mission, they seem unaware how \nmuch they\u0014\n                      sound like the liberals before them, for whom \nmission is\u0014\n                      \"everything the church is called to \ndo\"everything, that is,\u0014\n                      except evangelism. Liberals did not start out \nthat way, for the\u0014\n                      most part.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      No, Engel and Dyrness have not given up on the \nneed for\u0014\n                      spiritual regeneration, but their followers \nmight.

The neurologistwho\u0014\n               was spending a sabbatical year in Englandsaw\u0014\n               nothing out of the ordinary: the grimy Underground\u0014\n               station, a few dingy buildings, some pale gray sky.\u0014\n               He was thinking, a bit absent-mindedly, about the\u0014\n               Zen Buddhist retreat he was headed toward. And\u0014\n               then Austin suddenly felt a sense of enlightenment\u0014\n               unlike anything he had ever experienced. His\u0014\n               sense of individual existence, of separateness\u0014\n               from the physical world around him, evaporated\u0014\n               like morning mist in a bright dawn. He saw things\u0014\n               as they really are, he recalls. The sense of I,\u0014\n               me, mine disappeared. Time was not present,\u0014\n               he says. I had a sense of eternity. My old\u0014\n               yearnings, loathings, fear of death and\u0014\n               insinuations of selfhood vanished.

As a\u0014\n                                            neurologist, he accepts \nthat all\u0014\n                                            we see, hear, feel and \nthink is\u0014\n                                            mediated or created by the\u0014\n                         brain. Austins moment in the Underground \ntherefore\u0014\n                         inspired him to explore the neurological \nunderpinnings of\u0014\n                         spiritual and mystical experience. In order \nto feel that\u0014\n                         time, fear and self-consciousness have \ndissolved, he\u0014\n                         reasoned, certain brain circuits must be \ninterrupted.\u0014\n                         Which ones? Activity in the amygdala, which \nmonitors the\u0014\n                         environment for threats and registers fear, \nmust be\u0014\n                         damped. Parietal-lobe circuits, which orient \nyou in space\u0014\n                         and mark the sharp distinction between self \nand world,\u0014\n                         must go quiet. Frontal- and temporal-lobe \ncircuits, which\u0014\n                         mark time and generate self-awareness, must \ndisengage.\u0014\n                         When that happens, Austin concludes in a \nrecent paper,\u0014\n                         what we think of as our higher functions \nof selfhood\u0014\n                         appear briefly to drop out, dissolve, or \nbe deleted from\u0014\n                         consciousness. When he spun out his \ntheories in 1998,\u0014\n                         in the 844-page Zen and the Brain, it was \npublished not\u0014\n                         by some flaky New Age outfit but by MIT \nPress. \u0014\n\u0014\n                              Join Sharon Begley for a Live Talk on\u0014\n                         Thursday, May 3 at noon EDT to discuss\u0014\n                         'Neurotheology' and its theories and how they\u0014\n                         differ from what you might believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n     May 2  Why God Wont Go\u0014\n     Away: Brain science and the\u0014\n     biology of belief by Andrew\u0014\n     Newberg, M.D.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Since then, more and more scientists \nhave flocked\u0014\n                         to neurotheology, the study of the \nneurobiology of\u0014\n                         religion and spirituality. Last year the \nAmerican\u0014\n                         Psychological Association published \nVarieties of\u0014\n                         Anomalous Experience, covering enigmas from\u0014\n                         near-death experiences to mystical ones. At \nColumbia\u0014\n                         Universitys new Center for the Study of \nScience and\u0014\n                         Religion, one program investigates how \nspiritual\u0014\n                         experiences reflect peculiarly recurrent \nevents in human\u0014\n                         brains. In December, the scholarly Journal \nof\u0014\n                         Consciousness Studies devoted its issue to \nreligious\u0014\n                         moments ranging from Christic visions to \nshamanic\u0014\n                         states of consciousness. In May the book \nReligion in\u0014\n                         Mind, tackling subjects such as how \nreligious practices\u0014\n                         act back on the brains frontal lobes to \ninspire optimism\u0014\n                         and even creativity, reaches stores. And in \nWhy God\u0014\n                         Wont Go Away, published in April, Dr. \nAndrew Newberg\u0014\n                         of the University of Pennsylvania and his \nlate\u0014\n                         collaborator, Eugene dAquili, use \nbrain-imaging data\u0014\n                         they collected from Tibetan Buddhists lost \nin meditation\u0014\n                         and from Franciscan nuns deep in prayer to \n... well, what\u0014\n                         they do involves a lot of neuro-jargon about \nlobes and\u0014\n                         fissures. In a nutshell, though, they use \nthe data to\u0014\n                         identify what seems to be the brains \nspirituality circuit,\u0014\n                         and to explain how it is that religious \nrituals have the\u0014\n                         power to move believers and nonbelievers \nalike. \u0014\n                                     \u0014\n                         OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACE\u0014\n                                What all the new research shares is a \npassion for\u0014\n                         uncovering the neurological underpinnings of \nspiritual\u0014\n                         and mystical experiencesfor discovering, in \nshort, what\u0014\n                         happens in our brains when we sense that we \nhave\u0014\n                         encountered a reality different fromand, in \nsome\u0014\n                         crucial sense, higher thanthe reality of \neveryday\u0014\n                         experience, as psychologist David Wulff of \nWheaton\u0014\n                         College in Massachusetts puts it. In \nneurotheology,\u0014\n                         psychologists and neurologists try to \npinpoint which\u0014\n                         regions turn on, and which turn off, during \nexperiences\u0014\n                         that seem to exist outside time and space. \nIn this way it\u0014\n                         differs from the rudimentary research of the \n1950s and\u0014\n                         1960s that found, yeah, brain waves change \nwhen you\u0014\n                         meditate. But that research was silent on \nwhy brain\u0014\n                         waves change, or which specific regions in \nthe brain lie\u0014\n                         behind the change. Neuroimaging of a living, \nworking\u0014\n                         brain simply didnt exist back then. In \ncontrast, todays\u0014\n                         studies try to identify the brain circuits \nthat surge with\u0014\n                         activity when we think we have encountered \nthe divine,\u0014\n                         and when we feel transported by intense \nprayer, an\u0014\n                         uplifting ritual or sacred music. Although \nthe field is brand\u0014\n                         new and the answers only tentative, one \nthing is clear.\u0014\n                         Spiritual experiences are so consistent \nacross cultures,\u0014\n                         across time and across faiths, says Wulff, \nthat it\u0014\n                         suggest[s] a common core that is likely a \nreflection of\u0014\n                         structures and processes in the human brain.\u0014\n                                 There was a feeling of energy \ncentered within me ...\u0014\n                         going out to infinite space and returning \n... There was a\u0014\n                         relaxing of the dualistic mind, and an \nintense feeling of\u0014\n                         love. I felt a profound letting go of the \nboundaries around\u0014\n                         me, and a connection with some kind of \nenergy and state\u0014\n                         of being that had a quality of clarity, \ntransparency and\u0014\n                         joy. I felt a deep and profound sense of \nconnection to\u0014\n                         everything, recognizing that there never was \na true\u0014\n                         separation at all. \u0014\n                                 That is how Dr. Michael J. Baime, a\u0014\n                         colleague of Andrew  Newbergs at Penn,\u0014\n                         describes what he feels at the moment of peak\u0014\n                         transcendence when he practices Tibetan\u0014\n                         Buddhist meditation, as he has since he was \n14\u0014\n                         in 1969. Baime offered his brain to Newberg,\u0014\n                         who, since childhood, had wondered about\u0014\n                         the mystery of Gods existence. At Penn, \nNewbergs specialty is         \\ \u0014\n                         radiology, so he teamed with Eugene dAquili \nto use imaging\u0014\n                         techniques to detect which regions of the \nbrain are active\u0014\n                         during spiritual experiences. The scientists \nrecruited\u0014\n                         Baime and seven other Tibetan Buddhists, all \nskilled\u0014\n                         meditators.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                         TESTING FOR THE TIMELESS AND INFINITE\u0014\n                                In a typical run, Baime settled onto \nthe floor of a\u0014\n                         small darkened room, lit only by a few \ncandles and filled\u0014\n                         with jasmine incense. A string of twine lay \nbeside him.\u0014\n                         Concentrating on a mental image, he focused \nand\u0014\n                         focused, quieting his conscious mind (he \ntold the\u0014\n                         scientists afterward) until something he \nidentifies as his\u0014\n                         true inner self emerged. It felt timeless \nand infinite,\u0014\n                         Baime said afterward, a part of everyone \nand everything\u0014\n                         in existence. When he reached the peak of \nspiritual\u0014\n                         intensity, he tugged on the twine. Newberg, \nhuddled\u0014\n                         outside the room and holding the other end, \nfelt the pull\u0014\n                         and quickly injected a radioactive tracer \ninto an IV line\u0014\n                         that ran into Baimes left arm. After a few \nmoments, he\u0014\n                         whisked Baime off to a SPECT (single photon \nemission\u0014\n                         computed tomography) machine. By detecting \nthe tracer,\u0014\n                         it tracks blood flow in the brain. Blood \nflow correlates with\u0014\n                         neuronal activity.\u0014",

    "words": "This week  (May 21, 2001) United Nations forces \nlabored to reopen the Congo River, which \u0014\n                      had been unsafe for travel or commerce for \nabout two and a half years. \"The\u0014\n                      moment has come for peace,\" Security Council \nAmbassador Jean-David Levitte\u0014\n                      said Sunday night. \"And with the time of peace \nmust come an economic\u0014\n                      rebirth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Levitte is far from the first person to link \nAfrica's economic health and\u0014\n                      long-term stability to open waterways. A \nsimilar impulse drove David\u0014\n                      Livingstone to explore the Zambezi and Nile \nrivers on three voyages between\u0014\n                      1841 and 1873. But Livingstone's journeys had \nan added objective, for he\u0014\n                      believed that \"Christianity, Commerce, and \nCivilization\" were needed to\u0014\n                      improve life in Africa. He sought not merely a \ncommercial arterial, but \"God's\u0014\n                      Highway\" into the heart of the \"Dark Continent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Zambezi, which wends from the jungles of \nAngola and Congo through\u0014\n                      Mozambique to the Indian Ocean, was in \nLivingstone's day a river of human\u0014\n                      misery. Slaves were captured in European \ncolonies in the interior, shipped to\u0014\n                      the coast, and sold to Brazilian agents, who in \nturn sold them in Cuba and the\u0014\n                      United States. Following the river toward its \nsource, Livingstone frequently\u0014\n                      encountered groups of 50 to 100 men, women, and \nchildren traveling the\u0014\n                      other way, chained and shackled. Though he was \nnot as aware of the\u0014\n                      potential dangers of colonialism as observers \ntoday, he was intimately aware\u0014\n                      of the evils of slavery. And he thought he had \na solution.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The 1,700-mile-long Zambezi made a good \nthoroughfare for trade, and the\u0014\n                      tribes who used it were commercially savvy. The \ntribes were not, however,\u0014\n                      utterly dependent on the slave trade. They sold \nslaves because slaves were a\u0014\n                      popular commodity. Livingstone learned by \nexperience that the Africans were\u0014\n                      just as eager to sell \"legitimate\" goods, such \nas agricultural and animal\u0014\n                      products, and he believed that such business \ncould become the basis of a\u0014\n                      more stable, and much more humane, economy. The \npious Scottish colonists\u0014\n                      Livingstone hoped to import would help build \nthis economy while nurturing the\u0014\n                      Africans' souls.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For all his hopes, Livingstone achieved little \ntangible success. His Zambezi\u0014\n                      Expedition failed to find a waterway that \ncrossed the continent, and he\u0014\n                      missed discovering the source of the Nile by \nabout 200 miles. Though he\u0014\n                      spent one-third of his 30 years in Africa in \nthe service of a mission board, he\u0014\n                      made only one certified convertwho later \nbackslid. Yet through the\u0014\n                      post-colonial backlash in the second half of \nthe twentieth century, when\u0014\n                      many European references were erased from the \nAfrican map, the cities of\u0014\n                      Livingstone (Zambia), Livingstonia (Malawi), \nand Blantyre (the capital of\u0014\n                      Malawi, named for Livingstone's birthplace) \nremained intact.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The U.N. attempt to open the Congo will \nhopefully have a more significant,\u0014\n                      immediate impact on quality of life in Africa \nthan did Livingstone's efforts. At\u0014\n                      the same time, it is hard to imagine that \npurely economic and humanitarian\u0014\n                      endeavors will reach as deeply into people's \nhearts as did the labor, and\u0014\n                      example, of one failed missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      * For more on Livingstone, see CH issue 56, \nonline at\u0014\n                      http://www.christianhistory.net\u0014",

Having\u0014\n                      witnessed for 20 years the squandering of \nintellectual resources in\u0014\n                      the dumbing down of school curricula and news \nmedia, I am now\u0014\n                      distressed to see the same trend at work in the \nchurch. When I\u0014\n                      retreat from the educational trenches to the \nsanctuary on Sunday,\u0014\n                      I too often find the meat of the Gospels boiled \ndown to mush.\u0014\n                      Preachers I know to be intelligent human beings \nwho love God and\u0014\n                      are called to proclaim the Word succumb to the \ndownward pull of\u0014\n                      media culture by seeking to entertain rather \nthan to challenge or to\u0014\n                      \"re-mind\"to make us mindful. Homely references \nto daily life\u0014\n                      certainly have their place in sermons, but the \ntemptation to\u0014\n                      compete with standup comedians or to indulge in \nmediaspeak for\u0014\n                      the sake of a spurious relevancy seems to be \nalmost irresistible to\u0014\n                      clergy who think their flock comes only for the \nfun parts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Amusing anecdotes don't necessarily function as \nparables.\u0014\n                      References to New Yorker cartoons, Dilbert, \nSeinfeld, or Star\u0014\n                      Wars might serve to illustrate a point, but too \noften digress rather\u0014\n                      than direct our attention to the Word that \nhangs like a plumb line\u0014\n                      in a crooked world. Moreover, invoking popular \nculture can have the\u0014\n                      dubious effect of endorsing it. A reference to \nSeinfeld suggests\u0014\n                      that we all watch it and chuckle together over \nits variable repertoire\u0014\n                      of narcissistic preoccupations and flip \none-liners. And Seinfeld,\u0014\n                      from what I can tell by a limited sampling, \noffers marginally more\u0014\n                      than most sitcoms, on which typical \nconversations endure no\u0014\n                      more than 45 seconds, most transactions are \nexercises in\u0014\n                      one-upmanship, and few people are old, poor, \nsick, or wrestling\u0014\n                      with the complexities of real moral dilemmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dipping into the familiar fare of film, \ntelevision, or the Internet is\u0014\n                      only one form of dumbing down. Others may be \nworse. Certain\u0014\n                      ways of sentimentalizing, oversimplifying, or \nsweetening Jesus\u0014\n                      amount to blasphemy. In one of her many moments \nof shocking\u0014\n                      lucidity, Flannery O'Connor claimed that \nsentimentality is to\u0014\n                      Christianity what pornography is to love. \nThere's not much room for\u0014\n                      healthy fear of the Lord in a theology that \nmakes Jesus everyone's\u0014\n                      best pal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The outright bafflement of the disciples must \nitself seem baffling to\u0014\n                      those who rest comfortable in the belief that \nthey \"know\" the Lord\u0014\n                      on such intimate terms that they need only ask \nthemselves \"What\u0014\n                      would Jesus do?\" to arrive at an immediate \nsolution to any moral\u0014\n                      dilemma. How is it, I wonder, that they're so \nsure they know what\u0014\n                      Jesus would do? The very disciples who followed \nhim around\u0014\n                      appear to have been regularly taken by surprise.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What Jesus did do was most often characterized \nby\u0014\n                      counterintuitive, jolting, baffling, puzzling, \nor unconventional moves\u0014\n                      that even his closest followers seemed unable \nto predict or\u0014\n                      interpret. His parables were riddles. His \nteaching was always\u0014\n                      loving, sometimes comforting, often disturbing, \nand full of paradox.\u0014\n                      People met him and changed their lives, went \nhome rejoicing or\u0014\n                      sorrowing, plunged into self-examination or \naction of kinds they\u0014\n                      never would have thought to take on.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sermons (not to mention praise songs and \nSunday-school fare)\u0014\n                      betray their cause when they don't challenge us \nto think and act\u0014\n                      counterculturally; to review and rethink the \nnorms that numb; to\u0014\n                      look squarely at poverty, injustice, and \nirresponsible policymaking\u0014\n                      and recognize our own participatory \nresponsibility; or to work for\u0014\n                      the Kingdom rather than serving corporate \ninterests. Reinhold\u0014\n                      Niebuhr's provocative maxim about the function \nof sermons\"to\u0014\n                      comfort the afflicted and afflict the \ncomfortable\"sets a usable\u0014\n                      standard. Most of us, as Americans, are by \ndefinition in the latter\u0014\n                      group, though we all also live with the various \nills that flesh is heir\u0014\n                      to.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Walt Disney Company isn't going to provide \nthe salutary\u0014\n                      affliction we need. The screens and billboards \nwe look at offer\u0014\n                      narcotics to conscience. The church has the \nonly antidote that will\u0014\n                      work against materialism and media addiction. \nAnd, like most\u0014\n                      antidotes, it may have to hurt to heal.\u0014",

A bit of both,\u0014\n                       actually. Nazi oppression and massacres \nagainst political\u0014\n                       opponents and gypsies were obviously secular \nin nature - but the\u0014\n                       determination to exterminate the Jews from the \nface of the earth\u0014\n                       cannot possibly be understood without the \nbackground of\u0014\n                       centuries of persistent and violent \nanti-semitism, generally\u0014\n                       encouraged by religious authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Throughout Christian European history, Jews \nwere accused of\u0014\n                       \"Host Nailing\" - ritually nailing communion \nwafers to wood as a\u0014\n                       symbolic recreation of the killing of Jesus. \nJews were accused of\u0014\n                       the infamous \"Blood Libel\" - killing young \nChristian children in\u0014\n                       bizarre, satanic rituals. Jews were forcibly \nbaptized, then treated\u0014\n                       as heretics under the Inquisition if they \ndared to return to Jewish\u0014\n                       ways. Jews were accused of poisoning wells in \nan attempt to\u0014\n                       exterminate Christians (oh, the irony!). Jews \nwere forced into\u0014\n                       ghettos. Jews were prohibited from \nparticipating in a wide variety\u0014\n                       of occupations. Jews were ordered to wear \nidentifying badges by\u0014\n                       religious authorities so that everyone would \nknow who they were.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Christians were regularly told by their church \nleaders that the\u0014\n                       Jews killed Christ - killed God, in fact. \nChristians were told that\u0014\n                       Jews were greedy and untrustworthy. Passion \nplays - recreations\u0014\n                       of Jesus' alleged sacrifice - depicted Jews as \ncruel mockers of\u0014\n                       Jesus. Cathedral paintings depicted Jews in a \nterrible manner. I\u0014\n                       remember from my stay in Germany a painting \nhigh up on the\u0014\n                       outside of a Lutheran church: a Jew with his \narm pushed way up\u0014\n                       the nether-regions of a pig. This would be \ninsulting enough even\u0014\n                       if we didn't remember that pigs are considered \nunclean by Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       This is how Jews were portrayed day-in and \nday-out by both\u0014\n                       Catholic and Protestant churches for hundreds \nof years. No one\u0014\n                       can reasonably look at this situation and not \nrealize how\u0014\n                       tremendous a role Christian churches had in \ntilling and fertilizing\u0014\n                       the ground of anti-semitism and general hatred \nof others which\u0014\n                       ultimately led to the Holocaust. When Adolf \nHitler needed a\u0014\n                       scapegoat, he needed look no further than the \nJews which were\u0014\n                       regularly lambasted in his own Catholic \nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Anyone who looks through Nazi propaganda of \nthe time will\u0014\n                       quickly notice that religious - which is to \nsay Christian - imagery\u0014\n                       appears very often. It's not uncommon to see \nJews draining blood\u0014\n                       from Christians and reports of plans to kill \noff the German race.\u0014\n                       Such vilification of Jews simply would not \nhave been possible had\u0014\n                       not the churches already paved the way. \nFortunately, some\u0014\n                       Christian leaders have recognized this and \nattempted to\u0014\n                       apologize. In the early 1960s, Pope John \nXXIII wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                       \"The mark of Cain is stamped upon our \nforeheads. Across the\u0014\n                       centuries, our brother Abel has lain in blood \nwhich we drew, and\u0014\n                       shed tears we caused by forgetting Thy love. \nForgive us, Lord,\u0014\n                       for the curse we falsely attributed to their \nname as Jews.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Ireland\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The terrible combination of nationalism, \npolitics and religion has\u0014\n                       had deadly consequences for the people living \nin Northern\u0014\n                       Ireland. Catholics and Protestants have been \nvilifying, attacking,\u0014\n                       torturing and killing each other in a \nseemingly endless cycle which\u0014\n                       has only recently begun to show hopeful signs \nof finally ending.\u0014\n                       Ulster, the focal point of most of the \nviolence, is an amazingly\u0014\n                       beautiful province. But it's also a city where \nCatholics and\u0014\n                       Protestant live in walled-off, self-created \nghettos for mutual\u0014\n                       protection. The sniper bullets are usually \nblocked, but stones and\u0014\n                       bottles make it over the top.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The origins of Ireland's \"troubles\" lie in the \ndistant past of English\u0014\n                       imperialism. The creation of an Anglican \nProtestant church also\u0014\n                       created a fundamental religious conflict with \nan Irish population\u0014\n                       having little interest in converting with \ntheir neighbors. It wasn't\u0014\n                       until the reign of Elizabeth I that Ireland \nwas finally \"conquered,\"\u0014\n                       but she was never able to halt regular \nCatholic uprisings\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Ulster was drawn forever into the conflict \nwhen James I seized\u0014\n                       Catholic lands in and around the city in order \nto give them to loyal\u0014\n                       Protestants from England and Scotland. Evicted \nCatholics starved\u0014\n                       in the surrounding hills until a few crawled \nback and begged for\u0014\n                       menial jobs on their former farms. \nUnsurprisingly, revolts among\u0014\n                       Catholics continued across Ireland. When \nPuritan Oliver Cromwell\u0014\n                       took control of England, his reprisals against \nCatholics were\u0014\n                       amazing in their brutality. Under 1700s Penal \nLaws, Catholicism\u0014\n                       was outlawed and priests were banished. \nCatholics who tried to\u0014\n                       continue their faith in secret were hunted \nwith dogs and regularly\u0014\n                       killed outright. Although Catholicism regained \nlegal status in the\u0014\n                       1800s, Catholics had to pay tithes to the \nAnglican church. When\u0014\n                       this led to the \"Tithe War,\" both sides \nperpetrated cruelties in the\u0014\n                       name of the same God\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Finally, in this century, the southern \ncounties of Ireland were\u0014\n                       finally liberated from English rule - and \nbecame a 90% Catholic\u0014\n                       country where even today divorce is outlawed \nand women have to\u0014\n                       travel to England to obtain abortions. But the \ndescendants of King\u0014\n                       James' colonists voted to remain united with \nEngland - they\u0014\n                       feared how they would be treated in a \npredominantly Catholic\u0014\n                       nation. Later events indicate that such a fear \nmay have been\u0014\n                       justified. In the 1950s, the Irish Republican \nArmy was formed and\u0014\n                       began a terrorist campaign in and around \nUlster to force\u0014\n                       reunification with the south. Protestants \nformed their own\u0014\n                       paramilitary organizations to retaliate. When \nBritish troops arrived\u0014\n                       to enforce peace, their heavy-handed and \ninexperienced tactics\u0014\n                       ended up alienating both sides, making British \nsoldiers targets for\u0014\n                       both Catholic and Protestant terrorists.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Violence was perhaps worst during the 1970s \nwhen hundreds of\u0014\n                       terrorist acts were recorded year after year. \nEventually, things\u0014\n                       settled down to the intensity of a small scale \nwar. As James A.\u0014\n                       Haught has reported:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            ...in 1985, a relatively quiet year, \nauthorities\u0014\n                            recorded fifty-four assassinations, 148 \nbombings,\u0014\n                            237 shootings, 916 woundings, 522 arrests \non\u0014\n                            terrorism charges, 31 kneecappings \n(shooting out a\u0014\n                            person's kneecaps) and 3.3 tons of \nexplosives and\u0014\n                            weapons seized. All this in a tiny \ncountry with a\u0014\n                            population of 1.5 million people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       This past weekend, on August 15, was the first \nanniversary of the\u0014\n                       worst terrorist attack in over 30 years. In \nOmagh, 500 pounds of\u0014\n                       explosives shattered the downtown, killing 29 \npeople and injuring\u0014\n                       over 100, including children and tourists. \nEven today, no one has\u0014\n                       been arrested. The anniversary was marked by \nriots in\u0014\n                       Londonderry as Catholic protestors hurled \nMolotov cocktails at\u0014\n                       police to express anger at the fact that \nProtestants had been\u0014\n                       granted permission to march in memorial of \nsome ancient and\u0014\n                       forgettable battle.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Lest anyone try to claim that the strife is \nprimarily political in\u0014\n                       nature with religion simply being used as a \nconvenient excuse, it\u0014\n                       is instructive to look at the writings of \nProtestant demagogue Rev.\u0014\n                       Ian Paisley. This \"man of God\" has been a \nmember of both the\u0014\n                       European and British parliaments, and has \nvehemently argued\u0014\n                       that Catholicism is not really Christianity. \nHe labels the Catholic\u0014\n                       mass a \"blasphemy and a deceit\" and derides \ncelibate priests and\u0014\n                       their \"idolatrous worship.\" Catholics may be \nsurprised that such\u0014\n                       attitudes are not actually uncommon among some \nProtestant\u0014\n                       denominations, even in America. When another \nProtestant\u0014\n                       minister, Rev. David Armstrong, attempted a \ngoodwill visit to a\u0014\n                       neighboring Catholic church, he had a near \nriot in his own\u0014\n                       congregation and was forced to flee Ireland. \nThe death toll after\u0014\n                       more than two decades of fighting is about \n3,000 - and\u0014\n                       Christianity cannot shake responsibility for \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Gay America\u0014\n\u0014\n                       America in the 20th century has suffered from \nmany violent\u0014\n                       incidents which can be traced back to \nChristianity. Some have\u0014\n                       been organized, others not so organized, but \nall the result of\u0014\n                       specifically violent or dangerous doctrines \npromoted in Christian\u0014\n                       churches. One example of this is the \nincreasing rates of violence\u0014\n                       and hatred on a number of issues, including \nhomosexuality. The\u0014\n                       first thing to look at is the nature of the \nrhetoric and propaganda\u0014\n                       which is disseminated by \"good Christians\" \nwhen addressing this\u0014\n                       and similar issues. Senator Trent Lott has \nopenly compared\u0014\n                       homosexuals with thieves, expressing the \nfundamental\u0014\n                       assumption that homosexuality is essentially \ncriminal in nature\u0014\n                       and deserving of similar treatment. Then there \nhas been all of the\u0014\n                       newspaper ads which have appeared across the \ncountry,\u0014\n                       encouraging gays to abandon their \nhomosexuality and come to\u0014\n                       seek \"treatment\" which would \"cure\" them of \ntheir nasty, sinful\u0014\n                       ways. According to Christians, these ads are \nnot in any way\u0014\n                       \"anti-gay\" since they only \"hate the sin, not \nthe sinner.\" They\u0014\n                       claim that they are offering \"hope, not \nhatred\" with these ads, and\u0014\n                       that there is nothing about them which could \nreasonably be\u0014\n                       construed as helping to promote discriminatory \nor hateful\u0014\n                       attitudes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       But I ask you: If I were to place full page \nads explaining that\u0014\n                       Christianity is a Bad Thing and that people \nshould come to me for\u0014\n                       \"treatment\" which would \"cure\" them of their \nhorrible propensity to\u0014\n                       be Christians, how would that be construed? \nDoes anyone\u0014\n                       imagine that I would *not receive massive \ncriticism for writing\u0014\n                       anti-Christian propaganda? Even this very \narticle will be seen as\u0014\n                       anti-Christian by many - and this at least is \noffering extended,\u0014\n                       rational arguments. If any Christian can take \nthose ads, replace\u0014\n                       \"gay\" with \"Christian,\" and be offended, then \nthey are nothing\u0014\n                       short of hypocrites for supporting such ads \nwhen aimed at gays.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       It is no coincidence that all of this as \naccompanies actual violence\u0014\n                       against gays. Religious and political \nconservatives like to point\u0014\n                       out that ideas have consequences - and they \ncannot duck their\u0014\n                       own responsibilities here. When they go on at \nlengthy and\u0014\n                       homosexuals are criminal in nature, do not \ndeserve equal\u0014\n                       protection under the laws, are an abomination \nbefore God and\u0014\n                       are in desperate need of changing, how can \nthey not expect\u0014\n                       some violence to result? Time/CNN polls show \nthat three-quarters\u0014\n                       of adults questioned think that the problem of \nviolence against\u0014\n                       homosexuals is not only serious, but very \npossible in their own\u0014\n                       communities. This violence is not sporadic or \nisolated - instead, it\u0014\n                       is the natural result of constant anti-gay \npropaganda.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Unfortunately, gays aren't the only ones who \nhave to bear the\u0014\n                       brunt of Christian violence. Abortion clinics, \nproviders, and\u0014\n                       workers also often live in fear. Once again, \nviolent rhetoric has\u0014\n                       preceded violent acts. As the anti-abortion \nrhetoric has increased\u0014\n                       over the years, so has the anti-abortion \nviolence - property is\u0014\n                       destroyed, people are killed, and women are \ndenied access to\u0014\n                       medical care. Still at large is Eric Rudolph \nwho has been charged\u0014\n                       with a deadly bombing at the Olympics and with \ntwo other blasts in\u0014\n                       Atlanta at abortion clinics. Although the \nchoice of the Olympics as\u0014\n                       a target may sound strange, it must be \nremembered that many\u0014\n                       far-right Christians regard anything which \nsmacks of\u0014\n                       internationalism - the UN, the IMF, and the \nOlympics - as tools of\u0014\n                       Satan. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms\u0014\n                       regards the other attempted bombings and \nattempted arson\u0014\n                       attacks at Alabama abortion clinics to \nrepresent a heightened\u0014\n                       threat to life and property.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       In Florida in 1993, Dr. David Gunn was shot \nthree times in the\u0014\n                       back. Shortly thereafter in Oregon, Dr. George \nTiller was shot by\u0014\n                       Shelly Shannon, who later boasted that it was \n\"...the most holy,\u0014\n                       the most righteous thing I've ever done.\" When \nthe judge had to\u0014\n                       inform her that what she did was wrong, she \nresponded: \"They\u0014\n                       said that about Jesus.\" At the same time, Rev. \nDavid Troch\u0014\n                       attempted to put advertisements in a Catholic \nnewspaper arguing\u0014\n                       that it was \"justifiable homicide\" for \nChristians to kill abortion\u0014\n                       doctors.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       When Muslim extremists place a bomb at a bus \nstation in Israel, or\u0014\n                       shoot at a politician, it is justifiably \nregarded as an act committed\u0014\n                       by \"Muslim Terrorists.\" When are we going to \nwake up and\u0014\n                       recognize that similar acts here are being \ncommitted by \"Christian\u0014\n                       Terrorists\"? Anti-abortion activists are quick \nto take offense at the\u0014\n                       idea that their movement might have anything \nwhatsoever to do\u0014\n                       with helping an accused murderer - of course, \nthis is the same\u0014\n                       movement which has produced \"hit lists\" of \nabortion doctors. We\u0014\n                       have also seen the widespread use of violent, \nwar-like language\u0014\n                       on the part of major figures in the \nanti-abortion movement, and\u0014\n                       anyone who thinks that such rhetoric cannot \nhave a negative\u0014\n                       impact is in serious denial.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Christian Cults\u0014\n\u0014\n                       No account of Christian violence in America \nwould be complete\u0014\n                       without including some of the acts perpetrated \nby small groups\u0014\n                       usually known as \"cults.\" I deplore \nstereotyping of cults -\u0014\n                       something which is perhaps most common among \nChristian\u0014\n                       apologists. But although \"cults\" are no more \nlikely to be violent or\u0014\n                       neurotic than traditional religions, the fact \nremains that some very\u0014\n                       famous and very public incidents of violence \nhave occurred with\u0014\n                       so-called cults. And although some Christians \ntry to argue that\u0014\n                       these groups are not \"real\" Christians, such \narguments quickly fall\u0014\n                       flat. There is little reason to believe that \nsuch groups are any less\u0014\n                       \"Christian\" than traditional churches - \nunless, of course, you\u0014\n                       assume the \"truth\" of some particular brand of \nChristianity, which\u0014\n                       would not be reasonable or responsible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       In 1992, Yahweh ben Yahweh and six leaders of \nhis Temple of\u0014\n                       Love church in Florida were convicted of \nmurdering 14 church\u0014\n                       defectors and other critics. In this \npuritanical, Old Testament-style\u0014\n                       church of maybe 10,000 people, Yahweh taught \nthat people\u0014\n                       would have to kill a white person in order to \nbecome part of his\u0014\n                       \"inner circle.\" Lieutenants became his \"death \nangles\" who were\u0014\n                       ordered to kill church defectors and slum \nresidents who dared to\u0014\n                       oppose the church's efforts to buy community \nproperty.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       One of the most famous is surely the death of \nmore than 900\u0014\n                       members of the People's Temple in Jonestown, \nGuyana in 1978.\u0014\n                       Popular with political figures like Jerry \nBrown and even Jane\u0014\n                       Fonda, People's Temple leader Jim Jones \nproclaimed himself a\u0014\n                       prophet of God in the Christian tradition and \nperformed miracles\u0014\n                       like healing cancers to prove it. Former \nmembers reported\u0014\n                       strange happenings like odd sexual activity, \nchild abuse and the\u0014\n                       fact adults had to turn over all assets and \nincome to the church\u0014\n                       (effectively cutting them off from leaving the \ngroup - a common\u0014\n                       tactic of the worse cults one might find).\u0014\n\u0014\n                       In 1978 Rep. Leo Ryan of California went to \nthe compound in\u0014\n                       Guyana with aides and relatives of some church \nmembers who\u0014\n                       they claimed wanted to leave, but weren't \nallowed to. Although the\u0014\n                       trip began well enough, on the second day a TV \ncameraman\u0014\n                       received a note begging for help to escape and \na man with a\u0014\n                       knife attacked Ryan. When the visitors decided \nto return to\u0014\n                       America, sixteen church members decided to \naccompany them\u0014\n                       home. Upon boarding the plane, one of the \ndefectors revealed\u0014\n                       himself as a stooge planted by Jones by \npulling out a gun and\u0014\n                       shooting into the group. He was quickly joined \nby three more\u0014\n                       armed men, and they managed to wound Ryan, two \nNBC\u0014\n                       reporters, a San Francisco Examiner reporter \nand one female\u0014\n                       defector. Of these, four were then executed \nwith point-blank shots\u0014\n                       to the head while the female defector died \nfrom her injuries. The\u0014\n                       others were left unhurt or fled into the \njungle.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Meanwhile, back at the compound, Jones \nannounced the\u0014\n                       execution of Ryan and his party. He then \ninformed everyone that\u0014\n                       it was time for them to \"meet in another \nplace\" - the rumored\u0014\n                       suicide drills were about to be put to good \nuse. Cyanide was\u0014\n                       mixed with fruit drink by the church's doctor \nand two nurses as the\u0014\n                       colonists lined up for their portion. Mothers \nfed the mixture to their\u0014\n                       own infants - nearly 300 children died that \nday out of the 914\u0014\n                       bodies found. Some managed to slip into the \nwoods unseen by\u0014\n                       the armed guards patrolling the perimeter, \nelse we wouldn't know\u0014\n                       this much. On the same day, a female leader of \nthe church's\u0014\n                       Georgetown, Guyana headquarters had her and \nher three\u0014\n                       children's throats cut. More than a year \nlater, Al and Jeannie Mills\u0014\n                       (who had lead the attempts to expose Jones' \ngroup) were killed\u0014\n                       execution-style along with their 15-year-old \ndaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Is Christianity only a religion of Peace and \nLove? I do not think\u0014\n                       that anyone can honestly and objectively \nexamine these\u0014\n                       situations (and those from my previous two \narticles) in American\u0014\n                       or European history and answer \"yes\" to that \nquestion.\u0014\n                       Christianity *can encourage Peace and Love - \nbut it certainly\u0014\n                       need not, and it quite often has done just the \nopposite. Although\u0014\n                       the people responsible for violence might have \nfound a way to\u0014\n                       express their hatred without Christianity, it \ncannot be ignored that\u0014\n                       Christianity offers a convenient divine \nmandate for hatred and\u0014\n                       violent acts against a wide range of people in \nour diverse country.\u0014\n                       Christians are going to have to seriously \nrethink and revamp their\u0014\n                       faith if they are going to join in building a \nprosperous, pluralistic\u0014\n                       America of the future.\u0014",

A few minutes later, a \nfew of the aged threw punches. Every parent was locked in the \nbasement. The chessie children roared with cheers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  A few weeks ago some soccer moms (and dads) became \nrowdy - and ruffled some feathers. Parents of girls who played for \nthe Crofton Hot Shots, an under-14 travel team based in Maryland's \nD.C. suburbs, insulted - berated - a 16-year-old referee. They \nfollowed her to her car, vandalized it, threatened her. They were \ngoing to kick her derriere, go to her house, sue her. All the typical \nthings you'd expect any adult to say and do to a 16-year-old girl.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The ref told a disciplinary panel, \"I have never \nseen such hostile parents in all of my soccer life, either as a \nplayer, a spectator, or as a referee.\" The other day the Crofton \nAthletic Council decided it would disband the team.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The disturbing trend is nothing new.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -In 1999 a father of a Maryland girls soccer player \nharassed a female ref until he was asked to leave. Instead of \nleaving, he mooned her - and the other parents reacted not with \noutrage but with applause. The league barred parents from attending \nthree games.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -In New Mexico a parent bashed an umpire in the \nface with an aluminum bat, breaking an eye socket and his nose.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -A T-ball (played by 5- and 6-year-olds) coach in \nOklahoma choked a 15-year-old ump.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But these incidents occurred in New Mexico, \nOklahoma, and Maryland. They couldn't happen here in genteel \nVirginia, right?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In February parents started a brawl at a \nChesterfield basketball game. Like the Hot Shots players, the kids \npaid the price for their parents' misbehavior in the stands: Three \nteams were suspended from postseason play.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Perhaps league officials in Bethesda - and the \nchess tournment director in \"Fischer\" - had it right.\u0014",

POLLACK, PH.D.\u0014\n               With Kathleen Cushman \u0014\n\u0014\n               \"Just when we need peace and order, our boys may be \ncreating a\u0014\n               ruckus we can't control. Just when they need to be \nlearning most in the\u0014\n               classroom, they may stop doing their homework or \ncaring about\u0014\n               whether they succeed in school. Bombarded with violent \nimages from\u0014\n               mass media, they gravitate toward games and movies \nthat make our hair\u0014\n               stand on end...\u0014\n\u0014\n               Are boys somehow hardwired to be this way? \u0014\n               Or are we part of making it happen-and if so, can we \nchange it?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n               -Dr. William Pollack\u0014\n\u0014\n               In his ground breaking 1999 bestseller Real Boys, \nclinical psychologist\u0014\n               Dr. William Pollack opened our eyes to the national \ncrisis of boys,\u0014\n               revealed their unique emotional, psychological and \nphysical needs and\u0014\n               gave parents practical advice about how to raise boys \ntoday. In Real\u0014\n               Boys' Voices, Pollack let us hear boys speak for \nthemselves, and in their\u0014\n               own voices, about everything from violence, school, \nparents,\u0014\n               depression, girls, suicide, sports, sex and \nspirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Now Dr. Pollack, along with Dr. Kathleen Cushman, has \ncreated THE\u0014\n               REAL BOYS' WORKBOOK (Villard Books; May 2001; $15.95). \nThis\u0014\n               unique, instructive workbook is filled with advice, \nexercises and stories\u0014\n               to help parents, professionals and boys themselves \nunderstand\u0014\n               boys-and how to make life with them better. Through \nwriting down\u0014\n               responses in the workbook, using the charts and \nsummaries, and taking part in the provocative\u0014\n               question-and-answer sections, you will gain insight \ninto boys and their problems, understand how\u0014\n               your own set of expectations can be damaging to them, \nand ultimately be better equipped to interact\u0014\n               with boys in effective and powerful ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Dr. Pollack begins the REAL BOYS WORKBOOK by debunking \nthree widely-believed myths about\u0014\n               boys, which he calls the Boy Code:\u0014\n\u0014\n                    BOYS WILL BE BOYS-We're taught that boys' \ntestosterone levels make them \"naturally\" more\u0014\n                    aggressive, when in truth a boy's behavior is \nshaped more by his loved ones than by nature. \u0014\n                    BOYS SHOULD BE BOYS-Society expects boys to hide \n\"weak\" emotions like fear, hurt or\u0014\n                    shame behind a stoic mask, and only anger is an \nacceptable emotion. In fact, there are many\u0014\n                    diverse and healthy ways to express oneself as a \nmale. \u0014\n                    BOYS ARE TOXIC-We believe that unless they are \nkept under strict controls, boys are\u0014\n                    dangerous to society; actually, boys are \nempathetic and caring with a strong desire for\u0014\n                    justice. \u0014\n\u0014\n               By perpetuating these dangerous stereotypes, parents \nand teachers end up hurting-rather than\u0014\n               helping-boys, even when their intentions are good. Dr. \nPollack tells parents and teachers that they\u0014\n               must free boys from this \"gender straitjacket of the \nBoy Code\" and instead must give boys \"the\u0014\n               freedom to act with boldness and courage, to display \ntheir physical and intellectual prowess...and\u0014\n               express their full range of emotions and capabilities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n               Based on nearly two decades of clinical work, fresh \ninterviews and research as well as Pollack's\u0014\n               own clinical studies, Pollack delivers a step-by-step \nmanual for interacting with boys and intervening in\u0014\n               dozens of difficult situations. The REAL BOYS WORKBOOK \ncovers everything from younger boys'\u0014\n               early expressions of sensitivity, sibling wars, \naggressive behavior at school and dealing with death or\u0014\n               divorce, to adolescent issues of drugs, sex, sports \nand violent television and video games. For each\u0014\n               subject, Pollack provides written exercises as well as \nadvice on what (and what not) to say. As\u0014\n               Pollack writes, \"working through this book can help \nyou reflect on your own habitual responses-and\u0014\n               perhaps reexamine your beliefs about boys.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n               For instance, the REAL BOYS WORKBOOK section on \nbullying includes:\u0014\n\u0014\n               introductory thoughts on bullying, a real life \nbullying anecdote, a chart of warning signs, specific\u0014\n               advice on helping a boy who's been bullied, \nfill-in-the-blank questions for the parent or teacher, and a\u0014\n               checklist of things to work on. Pollack asks tough \nquestions: \"Is there anything about your response to\u0014\n               a student's aggression different when it's a boy, not \na girl, who's involved?\" And for teachers or youth\u0014\n               workers: \"Think of the most disruptive boy in the \ngroup you work with. Now write down two or three\u0014\n               things you like or appreciate about that student.\" \nPollack's questions force parents and teachers to pay\u0014\n               closer and more thoughtful attention not only to boys, \nbut also to how they respond to the boys.\u0014\n\u0014\n               The tragic shooting at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, Colorado left the nation confused and afraid\u0014\n               about the threat of extreme violence and its \nconnection to boys. Since then, instances of copycat\u0014\n               shootings have taken place across America. Never \nbefore has it been more urgent that parents and\u0014\n               teachers communicate openly with boys; yet in many \nways the shootings have made this more\u0014\n               difficult. In Real Boys Voices, Pollack analyzed the \nnational legacy of fear-the Columbine\u0014\n               Syndrome-that remains. He revealed how the violence \nhas made America afraid of boys, how\u0014\n               teachers, parents and students are stereotyping types \nof boys who may be violent, and how boys\u0014\n               themselves are afraid-afraid of being victims of \nviolence, afraid that if they are different, they will be\u0014\n               falsely accused of being predisposed to murderous rage \nand afraid to discuss the real feelings they\u0014\n               have inside themselves for fear that they will be \nconsidered violent.\u0014\n\u0014\n               The REAL BOYS WORKBOOK offers a practical guide to \ntalking with boys about rage and violence.\u0014\n               Pollack addresses the different issues believed to be \nat the root of these repeated school\u0014\n               shootings-isolation, loneliness, the need for \nattention, confusion over how to express hurt, and violent\u0014\n               images in the media. By intervening sooner rather than \nlater, Pollack hopes we can avert future\u0014\n               tragedies. He stresses that parents and teachers must \nbe on the lookout for signs of depression and\u0014\n               sadness; must neither exalt boys who fight nor \nostracize boys who show their vulnerability; and that\u0014\n               boys, as angry and aggressive as they may become, are \nhighly unlikely to become dangerous in any\u0014\n               way.\u0014\n\u0014\n               America's leading authority on boys, Dr. William \nPollack has compiled the definitive guide to\u0014\n               understanding boys of all ages. The REAL BOYS WORKBOOK \nwill give parents and teachers the\u0014\n               comprehensive advice they need to guide boys \nsuccessfully through the special challenges they face.\u0014\n\u0014\n               ABOUT THE AUTHORS\u0014\n\u0014\n               William Pollack, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, is \nthe codirector of the Center for Men at McLean\u0014\n               Hospital/Harvard Medical School, an assistant clinical \nprofessor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical\u0014\n               School, and a founding member and Fellow of the \nSociety for Psychological Study of Men and\u0014\n               Masculinity of the American Psychological Association. \nHe and his family live in Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Kathleen Cushman, Ed.D. co-authored Schooling for the \nReal World and Circus Dreams: The Making of\u0014\n               a Circus Artist, which won the American Library \nAssociation's Notable Book Award.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Buy it now at Amazon.com\u0014",

Before the prohibition, sung Persian poems \nknown as ghazals and instrumental Indian melodies called ragas were \nhighly popular in Afghanistan. Concerts featuring such traditional \ninstruments as the rubab (a short-necked lute) used to last for hours \nat celebratory occasions like weddings and births. Even Western pop \nmade its way to Kabul in the 1970s, when the capital was host to an \ninternational rock festival sponsored by a cigarette company.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 ABBA will survive the ban, but \nAfghan musicians fear some forms of music are\u0014\nthreatened with extinction. The archives of traditional Afghan folk \nsongs at Kabul Radio, for example, are being destroyed. The sounds of \nsilence, after all, are more reassuring to many governments than \nvoices that have the power to move, to persuade and to protest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 In the Sudan, musicians cannot \nperform after dark; in a Nigerian state where Islamic law is \nfollowed, a musician was recently imprisoned for singing. \"In much of \nthe Third World,\u0014\npeople cannot read or write,\" says Marie Korpe, executive director of \nFreemuse, a group in Denmark that monitors music censorship. \"People \nlisten to the radio, to songs. It is music that reaches people's \nhearts and souls.\" When music is muzzled, an outlet for \nself-expression is lost.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Zabi Sherki, 21, was jailed for \nsinging with other revelers on his wedding night in Kabul. \"We sang \nvery quietly, but the police came inside and beat us,\" he says. Upon \nhis release two months later, Sherki fled to Peshawar, Pakistan, and \njoined a band that plays at weddings. Those who cannot escape devise \nother ways to rebel. Shopkeepers sell cassettes on the black market, \nmusicians bury their instruments for retrieval later, and drivers \nblare their stereos in remote areas. In a tiny flat in Kabul, with \nthe shutters drawn, Naveeda crouches before a kerosene lamp and \nwhispers the lyrics of a popular love song to her familysoftly, so \nthat no one will report her. \"We're like dead people,\" says her \nbrother Nadir. \"When the evening comes, there's no electricity, no \nradio, no TV,\u0014\nno cinema.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Many Afghans refuse to keep quiet. \nIn a cramped studio off a busy thoroughfare in\u0014\nPeshawar, a few musicians sitting on faded red carpets take up \ninstruments while they await customers. On the walls are photos of \nthe band's performances. Zar Wali smiles broadly as he begins to play \nthe harmonium. \"My beloved country,\" he sings in his native Pashto, \n\"this Afghanistan, is very dear to me.\" The anthem is sweetsweet \nenough to  make him briefly forget that he is in Pakistan.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 REPORTED BY HANNAH BLOCH/PESHAWAR \nAND GHULAM HASNAIN/KABUL\u0014",

She began tutoring her neighbors'  \ndaughters, also banned from seeking \nan                                  education. It wasn't long before \nsome 45 children a day were knocking on her doorand \u0014\n                      only a little longer before the Taliban \ndiscovered her underground school. \"They beat \nme                         in front of the children,\" she recalls \nfrom her new home in the United States, \"and told me\u0014\n                      that if I did one more thing against the \nTaliban, they would kill me.\" Then they turned to \nthe                       girls, cowering in the corners. \"They told \nthem they would be burned alive if they ever \u0014\n                      returned to school again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such are the risks endured by women in \nAfghanistan since the Taliban began seizing\u0014\n                      control of the country in 1994brutalities that \nhave only recently garnered widespread\u0014\n                      attention in the United States. Thomas \nGouttierre, director of the Center for\u0014\n                      Afghanistan Studies at the University of \nNebraska-Omaha, estimates that 80 percent\u0014\n                      of Taliban forces are orphans from the war \nfought against the Soviets. Raised in\u0014\n                      religious schools in Pakistan known as \nmadrasahs, \"They grow up without ever\u0014\n                      having a normal conversation with sisters or \nmothers,\" says Maya Chadda, a political\u0014\n                      science professor at William Patterson \nUniversity and member of the Council on\u0014\n                      Foreign Relations. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's more, during the Soviet occupation in \nthe 1980s, women became 40 percent of\u0014\n                      Afghanistan's doctors, 60 percent of its \nuniversity faculty, and 50 percent of its\u0014\n                      government workersand consequently tarred with \na collaborator label. Thus women\u0014\n                      became equated with communism and corrupt ways, \nsays Belquis Ahmadi, who, at\u0014\n                      age 20, had headed the primary hospital for \nKabul's war wounded before the Taliban's\u0014\n                      takeover.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perversion. For the many women forced to flee \nAfghanistan, the perversion of their\u0014\n                      faith under the Taliban is the harshest \nreality. \"For God's sake, my grandmother is 78\u0014\n                      years old, and she had never put a burka on,\" \nsays Ahmadi, now a human-rights\u0014\n                      advocate living in the United States, who fled \nKabul in the cargo hold of a bus after\u0014\n                      refusing to wear the headdress on principle. \n(With its lack of ventilation and netting\u0014\n                      that provides only partial vision, the burka \nalso makes many women nauseated.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Muslim women say such repressive dress codes \naren't intrinsic to their religion.\u0014\n                      Indeed, Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, was a \nfan of womenand feisty ones at that.\u0014\n                      His first wife, Khadija, was a wealthy business \nowner who proposed marriage to\u0014\n                      him. And his daughter, Fatima, was a formidable \npolitical leader. Afghan women, too,\u0014\n                      are no strangers to strong roles. In the 15th \ncentury, Queen Gawhar Shad of Herat\u0014\n                      ruled a kingdom that stretched from China to \npresent-day Iraq. In 1980, 50 high school\u0014\n                      students were killed in the \"children's \nrevolts,\" organized by high school girls to protest\u0014\n                      the Soviet occupation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today, an estimated 2,000 members of the \nRevolutionary Association of the Women of\u0014\n                      Afghanistan aid their compatriots, running \nliteracy classes in refugee camps, staffing\u0014\n                      secret schools in Taliban-held regions, and \ndocumenting the public executions held\u0014\n                      each Friday in Kabul's sports stadium. \"We used \nto have festivals therecelebrations\u0014\n                      of Mother's Day and Children's Day,\" says \nHassina Sherjan Samad, who fled Kabul\u0014\n                      prior to the Soviet invasion and returned in \n1999 to open five underground schools for\u0014\n                      girls.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Conditions continue to deteriorate: More women \ndie in childbirth in Afghanistan than in\u0014\n                      almost any other country (only Sierra Leone has \na higher death rate). Turned away\u0014\n                      from medical centers reserved for men, women \nhave been relegated to clinics with\u0014\n                      few resources beyond the occasional X-ray \nmachine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, says Laila, there are few signs of life \nin Kabul. Kites, once a favorite children's\u0014\n                      toy, are banned. So are chess, and music, and \ndancing at weddings. The perfect\u0014\n                      breeding ground for \"future Osamas,\" Ahmadi \ncalls it. \"Women are not allowed to\u0014\n                      laugh out loudanything that would bring you a \nsecond of happiness,\" adds Laila. \"The\u0014\n                      Taliban wants us to forget we have a soul.\"\u0014",

Romans 1:18-32--God's Wrath on Idolaters\u0014\n\u0014\n18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the \ngodlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their \nwickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, \nbecause God has made it plain to them.  20 For since the creation of \nthe world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine \nnature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been \nmade, so that men are without excuse.  21 For although they knew God, \nthey neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their \nthinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.  22 \nAlthough they claimed to be wise, they became fools \u0014\n\u0014\n (1) 23 and exchanged (hllaxan) the glory of the immortal God for \nimages made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and \nreptiles.  24 Therefore God gave them over (paradwken) in the sinful \ndesires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their \nbodies with one another.\u0014\n\u0014\n (2) 25 They exchanged (methllaxan) the truth of God for a lie, and \nworshipped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is \nforever praised.  Amen.  26 Because of this, God gave them over \n(paradwken) to shameful lusts.\u0014\n\u0014\n (3) Even their women exchanged (methllaxan) natural relations for \nunnatural ones (para fusin).  27 In the same way the men also \nabandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust \nfor one another.  Men committed indecent acts with other men, and \nreceived in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  28 \nFurthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the \nknowledge of God, he gave them over (paradwken) to a depraved mind, \nto do what ought not to be done.\u0014\n29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed \nand depravity.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and \nmalice.  They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, \narrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey \ntheir parents; 31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, \nruthless.  32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those \nwho do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these \nvery things but also approve of those who practice them.\u0014\n\u0014\n1.  An Historical Analysis of Romans 1:26Heterogenital or \nHomogenital?\u0014\n\u0014\nRomans 1:18-32 is one of the primary Christian texts used to condemn \nhomosexuality.  In contemporary theology it is the only passage \ninterpreted to referring to female homosexuality.  This, however, has \nnot always been the standard interpretation of this passage.  Some \nearly church leaders interpreted this passage to refer not to female \nhomogenitality, but to non-procreative, heterosexual acts. Clement of \nAlexandria is one example:\u0014\n\u0014\nFor that reason, births are infrequent among hyenas, because they sow \ntheir seed contrary to nature.   Such godless people 'God has given \nover,' the Apostle says, 'to shameful lusts.  For the women change \ntheir natural use to that which is against nature.  ' Yet nature has \nnot allowed even the most sensual beasts to sexually misuse the \npassage made for excrement.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlurring the natural order, men play the part of women, and women \nplay the part of men, contrary to nature.  ...  No passage is closed \nagainst evil lusts; and their sexuality is a public institution--they \nare roommates with indulgence. (Clement, Paedagogos 2.10.86-87, \n3.3.21.3 translation mine)\u0014\nAnother early Christian writer, Anastasios, summarily dismisses the \nview that Paul was referring to female-female homogenital acts in his \ncomments on Rom 1:26: \"Clearly they (the females referred to in Rom \n1:26) do not go into one another, but rather offer themselves to the \nmen.\" \u0014\nAugustine also holds a non-homogenital view of this passage, \nconcluding that Paul was referring to non-procreative, heterosexual \nintercourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if one has relations even with one's wife in a part of the body \nwhich was not made for begetting children, such relations are against \nnature and indecent.  In fact, the same apostle earlier said the same \nthing about women, \"For their women exchanged natural relations for \nthose which are against nature.\" (Augustine, Marriage and Desire \n20.35)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother early text, from the Apocalypse of Peter (2nd century CE) \nshows us that heterosexual non-procreative sex, not lesbianism, was \ntypically paired with male homosexuality in discussions of the \nsubject.  While Brooten believes the female sexual reference in this \ntext is describing female homogenitality, I believe the more \nparsimonious interpretation arrives at the conclusion she attempts to \ndisprove.  There are two primary received texts of this work: the \nEthiopic fragment, and the Greek fragment.  Brooten uses the Greek \nfragment, the reading of which seems to be clearly talking about \nfemale homogenitality, but she admits that most scholars believe the \nEthiopic fragment is closer to the original.  It is the Ethiopic \nfragment which pairs male homogenitality with heterosexual \nnon-procreative acts.  It describes the punishment that Peter sees in \nhell for those men and women who engage in these sexually aberrant \nand idolatrous behaviors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd other men and women thrust themselves down from a high place.  \nThese are the worshippers of idols These are they which have cut \ntheir flesh as apostles of a man: and the women that were with them . \n. . and thus are the men who defiled themselves with one another in \nthe fashion of women.    All the golden and silver idols, all idols, \nthe work of men's hands, and what resembles the images of cats and \nlions, of reptiles and wild beasts, and the men and women who \nmanufactured the images thereof, shall be in chains of fire. \n(Apocalypse of Peter 10)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reference to the idols made in the image of animals and reptiles, \ntogether with the description of male homogenitality and the female \nsexual reference is reminiscent of the Romans 1 passage.  One of the \nrelevant aspects of this passage is the cryptic reference to the men \nwho have cut their flesh  and the women that were with them.  This \nreference may very well be describing a unique ritual of the goddess \ncults.\u0014\n\u0014\n My contention in this paper is that the Romans 1:26-27 reference to \nsexuality is specifically a reference to the gender/sexuality \ntransgressions of the participants in the goddess religions.  One of \nthe unique features of this religion is that the male priests (galli) \nwere widely believed to castrate themselves as part of their sacred \nrituals.  Further, as a means of gender transcendence, female \nworshippers were believed to use artificial phalli in ritualistic sex \nacts with these castrated priests, as well has having the castrated \npriests engage in sexual acts with the male worshippers.  The above \nreference in the Apocalypse of Peter would certainly meet the \ncriteria for this context and the similarities between this and the \nRomans 1 passage strengthens the argument that I will make in the \nbody of this paper.\u0014\nOne of the primary problems in trying to understand Romans 1 is that \nin addition to the structural complexity of the passage, there is an \nuncertainty in the meaning of certain phrases in the text, such as \n\"exchanged natural relations for unnatural\" (para fusin, 26b).  The \nmodern reader, who may be enculturated to read these verses as a \nclear reference to all homogenital acts, might read an inherent \nrelationship between the words \"unnatural\" and \"homosexual\" that the \nancient writer probably did not intend.  For example, the phrase para \nfusin (\"unnatural\") could, in other sexually related contexts, refer \nto sex with a barren or pregnant woman, sex with a menstruating \nwoman, pederasty or sex between animals of different species.  These \ncontexts are tied together by the understanding of many popular \nJewish and Greek thinkers that described the purpose of sex as solely \nfor procreation.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not to say that Paul was necessarily bringing a \nprocreationist understanding of the phrase to this passage.  It is \nmerely to emphasize that it is easy to read modern linguistic \nassumptions back into the text, which we must be careful not to do.  \nIt is instructive to note that Paul didn't see an inherent evil \ncontained in the phrase para fusin (as the modern reader might), for \nwe later see him describing God as acting para fusin by grafting \nGentiles into God's soteriological tree (Rom 11:23-24).  Regardless \nof Paul's intended use of para fusin, there is evidence to suggest \nthat the actions and people described in Romans 1:26b may not be two \nwomen involved in homogenital acts.  There was certainly no consensus \nfor that interpretation in the early church, there is little literary \nprecedent for the pairing of female and male homogenital acts in the \nwritings of the time and the common usage of para fusin in a sexual \ncontext tended to imply a male participant.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.  A Grammatical Analysis of Romans 1: Homosexuality or Pagan Sex \nRituals?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe primary pattern of Rom 1:18-32 is the use of the phrases \"they \nexchanged\" (met/hllaxan; vs 23, 25, 26b) and \"God gave them over\" \n(paradwken; vs 24, 26a, 28), which enclose three parallel thoughts \nbetween verses 23-28.  Parallelism is extremely common in Hebrew and \nGreek literature, and involves repeating a thought in a different way \nfor emphasis.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Paul would have been very familiar with this device for emphasis, \nand it seems clear from the structure of this passage that Paul is \nusing it to emphasize God's wrath against the sin of idolatry. He \nbegins in verses 18-20 by showing the readers that there is some part \nof God's character (\"His eternal power and divine nature\") that can \nbe seen in creation itself, apart from the special revelation found \nin His Scriptures. Thus, even Gentiles are without excuse.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe are told that these Gentiles knew God from creation, however \n\"they neither glorified Him as God, nor gave thanks to Him\" (v. 21).  \nThough at one time they knew God (v. 21), they ended up in the \nposition that they \"did not think it worthwhile to retain the \nknowledge of God\" (v. 28).  Paul shows us in this chapter that there \nis a linear progression that begins with failing to glorify God as \nGod, followed by abandoning the concept of God, which subsequently \nleads to various sinful behaviors (murder, etc) as described in the \nlast several verses of the chapter (29-31). Finally, we see that \nwhile somehow these Gentiles knew the laws of God, and knew that \nbreaking these laws deserve death, they not only practiced these \nbehaviors, but approved of others who did the same (v. 32).\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe primary focus of the chapter is on Gentiles who stop worshipping \nGod, and who \"exchange/substitute\" (met/hllaxan) the worship of God \nfor the worship of idols.  While one could easily postulate that the \nidolatry substitution could extend metaphorically to anything that \ntakes one's focus off of God (philosophies, unrelenting schedules, \nreligiosity, addictions, etc.), Paul's language seems to limit us \nspecifically to explicit idol worship.  Both of the first two \nparallel passages (vs 23-24, 25-26a), which are clearly bracketed by \nthe repeated phrases \"they exchanged\" and \"God gave them over,\" very \ngraphically describe idol worship as it would have been found in \nGreco-Roman pagan rituals at the time of Paul's writing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe third parallel is similarly bracketed with the words methllaxan \nand paradwken, but does not, at first glance, appear to follow the \npattern of the first two parts.  As in the first two, we see that God \nhas given them over to wicked behavior (v.  28).  However, in both of \nthe first two parts we see that what they exchanged for God were \nclearly idolatrous behaviors, while in the third part, we see only \nsexual behaviors exchanged/substituted.  This is the primary \nstructural difficulty with this text.  If one assumes that the things \nbeing exchanged in verses 23 and 25 are metaphors for anything that \ndraw us away from God, it is then easy to say that the sexual \nbehaviors described in verses 26b-27 could describe general \nhomogenital behavior.  However, it seems like a poor handling of the \ntext to allow for such a metaphorical interpretation, when the texts \nare so explicitly concrete in their description of pagan idolatry \n(\"images made to look like mortal man\", \"worshipped and served \ncreated things\").  In the same way, in order to preserve the symmetry \nof the parallel verses, it is safest to suppose that the third \nparallel refers specifically to pagan rituals.  The fact that \nhomogenitality is described in this context is logical when placed in \nthe cultural setting where homogenital sacred sex was commonly \nassociated with certain pagan rituals. Thus, taking this \ninterpretation of Romans 1:26b-27 preserves the symmetry inherent in \nthe text.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome have argued against this interpretation of three parallel \naccounts of pagan rituals, claiming that only the first two clauses \nspeak to this issue.  The third clause turns the line of reasoning \naway from ritual practices to all sinful behavior, and that \nhomosexuality represents an archetype of sin that the Jewish and \nRoman readers of the letter would see as one of the worst possible \nsins (an argument that is poorly supported, given the sparse mention \nof homosexuality, especially lesbianism, in the Jewish Testament and \nin Rabbinic writings).  The argument continues that Paul finishes his \nthought in verses 29-31, providing a larger sin-list,'' of which \nhomosexuality is merely the first, separated by verse 28, a \ndescription of what God has to do when confronted with unrepentant \nsinners.  Interpreted this way, the third clause, verses 26b-28, does \nnot represent ritual idolatry, but represents all sins, and thus \nPaul's reference to homogenitality would not be interpreted to be \nlimited to pagan temple prostitution.\u0014\nHowever, the grammar of the passage prevents that interpretation as \ndescribed by Chamberlain. First, kai kaQwV, found in verse 28 \n(translated as 'since' in the NIV) separates the previous discussion \nfrom the discussion that follows it, making the homogenital behavior \nlisted in verses 26b-28 part of a different clause than the sin-list \nin verses 29-32.  Chamberlain explains that kaQwV here takes a causal \nmeaning: \"Sometimes, it seems to shade off into the causal idea \n[quotes Rom 1:28 in Greek], 'because they did not approve having God \nin (their) knowledge God gave them up to a reprobate mind,'\" \u0014\nSecond, Chamberlain discusses the verb translated 'to do' in verse \n28: \"When it explains a verb, it is called the epexegetical \ninfinitive: poiein (Rom 1.28), 'to do' (the things that are \nunseemly), explains what Paul means by paredwken autouV o QeoV eiV \nadokimon nouV, 'God gave them up to a reprobate mind.' \u0014\nThe list of unseemly acts follows.\"   This gives the following \nparaphrased rendering of verse 28: \"And because of the fact that (kai \nkaQwV) they stopped believing in God, He gave them over (paradwken) \nto a worthless mind, to do (poiein) evil things, as listed in the \nfollowing verses.\"  \u0014\nThus, the acts listed in verses 26b-27 (which are the pagan \nhomogenital sacred sex acts) are part of the ultimate cause of God \ngiving them over, not the result of God giving them over.  This makes \nthem clearly separate from the acts listed in verses 29-31, which are \nthe result of God having given them over, and not the cause.  Having \ngrammatically separated what is cause and what is result in this \npassage, one can see that the homogenital acts must be separate \nentities from the sin-list and therefore are intended to be \ninterpreted in the context of the three-clause, metallaxan/paradwken \nsystem, not part of the sin-list.  \u0014\n\u0014\nInsert Table One Here\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the first two parallels, we see that God gave them over to \nevil behaviors because of certain actions they took (\"exchanging the \nglory of God for images\", and then worshipping and serving created \nthings rather than the creator).  However, God did not give them over \nbecause of the exchange itself, but because of actions taken as a \nresult of the exchange (in the second parallel, they have exchanged \nthe truth of God for a lie, but the resulting action is that they \n\"worshipped and served created things\").  In the third parallel, they \nexchanged natural relations (fusikhn chrhsin) for those that are \nagainst nature (para fusin) as described in verses 26b-27.  However, \nit was not those exchanges that caused God to give them over.  Those \nexchanges resulted in the action of verse 28, \"they did not think it \nworthwhile to retain a knowledge of God\", which is what caused God to \ngive them over.  It was not the sexual behavior that caused God to \ngive them over, but it was the fact that they abandoned their belief \nin God that caused Him to give them over.  The pagan sexual behavior \nwas a key part of the process of their rejection of their belief in \nGod, just as making idols and worshipping/serving idols was a key \npart of the process in verses 23-26a.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Jewish Background for Paul's Anti-Sexual References\u0014\n\u0014\nSome may argue that the background for Paul's condemnations of \nhomosexuality (both in Rom 1 and in 1 Co 6:9) are based on the \nLeviticus 18:22 and 20:13 prohibitions on male-male homosexuality and \nit is in that light that we should read the Romans and 1 Corinthians \nprohibitions. However, even if Paul was grounding his statements in \nthe Leviticus passages, he still may have been referring to cultic \nsexual practices.   Evidence suggests that ritualistic sexual \npractices faced by the early Christians were similar to those faced \nby the early Israelites.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are several references to sacred prostitution in Scripture.  \nMost of the clear references to the nature of the sexuality come from \nthe Jewish Testament.  In most of these cases, the references \ndescribe the vdq, the male \"holy ones\" (Deut 23:17, 1 Kgs 14:24, 1 \nKgs 15:12, Kgs 22:46, 2 Kgs 23:7, Job 36:4, Hos 4:14)\u0014\n\u0014\n.  During the 2nd and early 1st millennia BCE we find evidence of \nsacred sex practices by the cultures that would have impacted the \ngrowing Jewish nation.  Such an impact can be seen in the commands \nattributed to Yhvh to banish the vdq from the land and to avoid all \nof their non-Israelite practices.  Placing the prohibitions on \nsame-gender sex, as found in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, into the \ncontext of sacred/ritualized sex, becomes a distinct possibility in \nlight of the surrounding cultures\u0014\n.  \u0014\n\tOne possible link to the vdq mentioned in the Jewish Testament and \nthe assinu of the goddesses is the reference in Dt 23:17-18 to \n\"dogs\": \"No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute \n(vdq).  You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute (hnz) \nor of a male prostitute (blk, or 'dog') into the house of the Lord \nyour God to pay any vow, because the Lord your God detests them \nboth.\" In this text, the author seems to be using the word 'dog' in a \nderogatory sense, in the same way we tend to today when using it to \nrefer to a person.  However, the derogatory sense of 'dog' was not \nuniversal at the time.  It often was used in reference to the \nfaithfulness of a trusted and loyal servant.  Thomas notes the \npromise of Abdi-Asratu to Pharaoh: \"I am the servant of the king, and \nthe dog of his house\", calling himself \"Pharaoh's faithful \nwatch-dog\".  The term for 'dog' used here is kalbu, similar to the \ntitle of the goddess priests, the kalu, as discussed above, and could \nalso be compounded with the title of a god to show priestly servitude \nto that god: \"Kalbi-Sin, Kalbi-Samas, Kalbi-Marduk\".  Thomas goes on \nto mention, \"At the temple of Astarte at Kition in Cyprus there were \ncultic persons, temple servants, who were called klbm\".  Moreover, \nanother ancient term for a sexual-variant priest, assinu, \"joins the \n[Sumerogram] symbols for 'dog' and 'woman'\".  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIt is possible that the Christian Testament carries this same theme \ninto the Greek language.  Both Paul and John talk about 'dogs' in the \nsense of an evil person.  John, in Revelation 22:15, lists those who \nwill be left outside the gates of the city: \"The dogs (kunes), those \nwho practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the \nidolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.\"  Similarly \nPaul, in Philippians gives a reference to 'dogs' which is \ntraditionally interpreted as referring to Jews because of the \nsubsequent discussion of circumcision, but may possibly be referring \nto the castration aspect of the goddess religions: \"Watch out for \nthose dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.  \nFor it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit \nof God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the \nflesh\".  Given the prevalence of the goddess religions in the \nGreco-Roman world, and the precedent set by the language of the \nJewish Testament and the surrounding cultures, it is possible that \nthese references are describing the galli, the \ngender/sexually-variant priests of the goddess religions described \nbelow.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the association between idolatry, pagan rituals and wicked \nsexual practices was far from uncommon in the Jewish mind.  As we \nhave seen, the Jewish Testament has several specific references to \nmale homosexual prostitutes in conjunction with non-Israelite \nworship. In an inter-testamental Jewish work, the Wisdom of Solomon, \nwe find an association that is almost identical to that made by Paul \nin Romans 1, clarifying the literary and Judaic background from which \nPaul may have been writing. As will be shown, several of the specific \nritual references described in this passage can be seen in pagan \ngoddess rituals.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication, and \nthe invention of them was the corruption of life, for neither have \nthey existed from the beginning nor will they exist for ever.   \nAfterward it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of \nGod, but they live in great strife due to ignorance, and they call \nsuch great evils peace.  For whether they kill children in their \ninitiations, or celebrate secret mysteries, or hold frenzied revels \nwith strange customs, they no longer keep either their lives or their \nmarriages pure, but they either treacherously kill one another, or \ngrieve one another by adultery, and all is a raging riot of blood and \nmurder, theft and deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury, \nconfusion over what is good, forgetfulness of favors, pollution of \nsouls, sex perversion, disorder in marriage, adultery, and \ndebauchery.  (Wis 14:12-31)\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAs evidenced by this passage, the association between sexual \nimmorality and pagan rituals seems clear in the mind of the Jewish \nauthor.  But just as sexual immorality in general was not limited to \nthe ritual context, neither was homosexuality limited to the ritual \ncontext.  So while I will spend the rest of this paper showing that \nPaul's most likely intent for Romans 1:26-27 was to condemn ritual \nsexual practices, I should briefly mention non-ritualistic \nhomogenital behavior in the Greco-Roman world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThere has been much debate regarding the types of homosexuality to \nwhich Paul would have been exposed.  Some have argued that Paul would \nonly have known about pederasty, others have argued that Paul's \nprimary knowledge was of homosexual prostitution, while others have \nargued that Paul would have been exposed to a much broader range of \nhomosexualities.  Smith provides a good survey of the types of \nhomosexualities for which we have evidence during the Greco-Roman \nera.  Larger treatises have dealt extensively with the issue of \nGreco-Roman homosexualities, so I will not explore it in this paper.  \nSuffice it to say that Paul may have been aware of several types of \nhomosexualities: ritualistic homogenitality, pederasty, homosexual \nprostitution, master-slave relationships, mutually consenting \ngay/lesbian relationships and possibly even marriage-like gay/lesbian \nrelationships.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRegardless of the types of homosexualities known to Paul, it is my \ncontention that Paul is specifically addressing ritual homogenitality \nin the context of Romans 1.  Other authors have addressed Paul's \nintended meaning for arsenokoites and malakos in 1 Co 6:9 and 1 Tim \n1:9-10.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Whether or not those references are to male prostitutes, to \nsexually assaultive practices or represent a juxtaposition between \npassive and active sexual partners sheds little light on the issue at \nhand: Paul's intent for Romans 1:26-27. Regardless of Paul's view of \ngeneral homogenital contact, I will attempt to show in this paper \nthat the context of Romans 1 limits the homogenital reference in 1.27 \nto the ritual context and should not be extended to the many other \ntypes of homosexualities to which Paul may have been exposed.\u0014\n\u0014\nII.  Paul Versus the Goddess Religions\u0014\n\u0014\n1.  The Goddess Religions\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe goddess religions were very popular in the Greco-Roman era.  \nDuring the time of Paul's missionary travels, the goddess religions \nwere having a wide resurgence.  Temples dedicated to Cybele/Attis, \nArtemis, Aphrodite, Demeter and Venus were scattered throughout most \ncities of the region.  The temple to Artemis in Ephesus was the \nlargest building in the world at the time and one of the Seven \nWonders of the World.  The temple to Aphrodite in Corinth was \nconjectured to have had more than 1,000 temple prostitutes.  In Rome, \nthe Cybele/Attis temple was built in the heart of the city on one of \nthe Seven Hills of Rome, and the Roman temple to Aphrodite was on \nanother of these hills, the Capitolene.  The official sanctions that \nhad prevented citizens from fully participating in the priestly \nrituals were lifted in the mid-first century CE.  In addition, \nCybele's image was printed on Roman coinage and two major \ncity-festivals, the Day of Blood and the Megalensia, were organized \naround Cybele and Attis.  A statue of Cybele presided over most of \nthe public games.  It is my belief that the popularity and power of \nthe goddess religions during the time of Paul's ministry gave him a \nreadily available target to use in his description of people who fall \naway from God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe religion of the mother goddess, the Great Mother (Magna Mater), \ndates at least as far back as 6000 BCE.  A terracotta figurine from \nthis era, found at Catal Huyuk, near modern-day Konia, Turkey, shows \nthe Mother in a classic pose, sitting on her throne between two large \ncats.\u0014\n  Her religion had taken root in Asia Minor by at least the seventh \ncentury BCE,\u0014\n in Greece by the 5th or early 4th century,\u0014\n and her official entry into Rome was on April 6, 204 BCE.  In 191 \nBC, Cybele's temple on Palatine Hill was completed, was burned down \nin 111 BCE and soon rebuilt, then again burned and was rebuilt around \n3 CE under Augustus.  This structure remained in use until the 5th \ncentury CE.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tCybele's consort, Attis, has several different legends attached to \nhis name.  Arnobius provides a Roman version, by way of the Greek \nTimotheus. The retelling of this legend shows us many specific and \nmetaphorical practices that were carried out in the goddess rituals..\u0014\n\u0014\n            \"In Phrygia [the mother of the gods] given over to sleep \non the summit of a rock, Jupiter assailed with lewdest desires.  But \nwhen, he could not accomplish what he had proposed, he spent his lust \non the stone.  This the rock received, and Acdestis is born.  In him \nthere had been resistless might, and a fierceness of disposition \nbeyond control, a lust made furious, and derived from both sexes.  \nNow, when it had been considered by the gods, by what means it might \nbe possible to curb his audacity, Liber takes upon himself this \ntask.  With the strongest wine he drugs a spring much resorted to by \nAcdestis.  Overcome, he is sent fast asleep.  Liber is near the \nsnare; over his foot he throws one end of a halter, with the other \nend he lays hold of his privy members.  When the fumes of the wine \npassed off, Acdestis starts up furiously, and by his own strength he \nrobs himself of his sex; with the tearing asunder of these parts \nthere is an immense flow of blood; both are carried off and swallowed \nup by the earth; from them there suddenly springs up a pomegranate \ntree.  Nana, daughter of the king, gathers and places in her bosom \nsome of the fruit.  By this she becomes pregnant; her father shuts \nher up, supposing that she had been debauched, and seeks to have her \nstarved to death; she is kept alive by the mother of the gods, and \nbrings forth a child, but the king orders it to be exposed.  Him the \nmother of the gods loved exceedingly, because he was of most \nsurpassing beauty; and Acdestis, who was his companion, as he grew up \nfondling him, and bound to him by wicked compliance with his lust in \nthe only way now possible.  Afterwards, under the influence of wine, \nhe admits that he is loved by Acdestis.  Midas, king of Pessinus, \nwishing to withdraw the youth from so disgraceful an intimacy, \nresolves to give him his own daughter in marriage.  Acdestis, \nbursting with rage because of the boy's being torn from himself, \nfills all the guests with frenzied madness: a daughter of adulterous \nGallus cuts off her breasts; Attis, raving frantically and tossed \nabout, throws himself down at last, and under a pine tree mutilates \nhimself.  From the blood which had flowed springs a flower, the \nviolet, and with this the tree is girt. (Arnobius, Against the \nHeathen 5; edited for brevity)\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSeveral aspects of Cybele and Attis can be observed from this \npassage, which help us understand the rituals absorbed by their \nfollowers.  First, the immaculate nature of Acdestis' birth is \nindicative of the sexual stature of Cybele.  While she is the mother \nof the gods, she is also virginal.  In some versions of the myth, \nCybele herself is Attis' mother, being replaced for Nana above (Livy, \nOvid). In some versions, Attis, the shepherd, is Cybele's beloved, \nbut they never consummate their relationship sexually, due to Attis' \nemasculation.  The female priests of several goddesses mimic this \npart of the myth in their method of sacred sexuality in the temple: \nthey give their bodies as sexual implements to the worshippers, but \nonly in ways which prevent pregnancy, thus maintaining their \nunderstanding of virginity, which could be a link to Paul's \nheterogenital reference of non-procreative sex in Romans 1:26b.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tA second aspect of this story is Acdestis' hermaphroditic character, \nhis extreme emotional passion merging with sexual and violent \ninstability, and his subsequent emasculation.  In some versions of \nthe story Acdestis has the capacity to produce offspring asexually.  \nHis hermaphroditic nature was expressed both as anatomical duality, \nas well as prolific bisexual behavior.  The galli (priests of Attis) \nsaw this as a transcendence of gender by Acdestis, encompassing both \nsexual/gender natures in one person.  Attis and Cybele, along with \nseveral other gods and goddesses exhibited sexual-variant and \ntransgender behavior.  Many of the goddess rituals exhibit an attempt \nto transcend gender, incorporating sacred sexuality, transgender \nbehaviors, and transsexualism into their religions.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIt is Acdestis' transgender nature that causes such fear among the \nother gods, leading them to rule that one of his genders, if not \nboth, must be removed.  However, even after Acdestis' masculine \ngenitalia are removed, he still retains his sexuality and his \ncapacity to love in his relationship with Attis.  In fact, when his \nrelationship with Attis is threatened by outside intervention, \nAcdestis induces a Bacchalic mania in the wedding party, including in \nAttis.  In some versions of the story it is Cybele's jealousy that \ninduces the mania.  This mania represents the third characteristic of \nthe story that is important in understanding the Cybele/Attis \nreligions.  In an imitation of Attis' frenzy, the priests of Attis, \nthe galli, use music, dance, and knives/swords to whip themselves \ninto a bloody frenzy, ending with the violent act of \nself-emasculation.  \u0014\n\u0014\n           It was these public and spectacular images of the galli \nthat would have provided Paul with the vivid imagery of goddess \nworship and sexual idiosyncrasies that his readers would immediately \nhave recognized in Romans 1.  The extent of the worship of Cybele and \nAttis in Greco-Roman culture should not be underestimated.  Fear \nnotes that while \"mystery religions in general were not a focus of \nChristian polemic, Attis and Cybele on the other hand appear to have \nbeen a favorite target for the invective of Christian writers.\"  \nRoller describes the worship of Cybele as central to Roman life: \u0014\n                        \"By the first century CE, the Magna Mater was \nthus a divinity with a central place in Roman life.  And the place of \nhonor created for her cult in the first two centuries of its \nexistence in Rome continued under the early Empire...

Bass \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How often people today cry out in exasperation \nor despair, \"I just\u0014\n                      don't have enough time!\" There is so much to \ndo: earn a living,\u0014\n                      fulfill a vocation, nurture relationships, care \nfor dependents,\u0014\n                      exercise, clean the house. Moreover, we hope to \nmaintain sanity\u0014\n                      while doing all this, and to keep growing as \nfaithful and loving\u0014\n                      people at the same time. We are finite, and the \ndemands seem\u0014\n                      too great, the time too short. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those of us who feel pressed for time have lots \nof company. In a\u0014\n                      surprise bestseller of 1991, The Overworked \nAmerican,\u0014\n                      economist Juliet Schor reported that work hours \nand stress are\u0014\n                      up, and sleep and family time are down for all \nclasses of\u0014\n                      employed Americans. Wives working outside the \nhome return to\u0014\n                      find a \"second shift\" of housework awaiting \nthem. Husbands add\u0014\n                      overtime or second jobs to their schedules. \nSingle parents\u0014\n                      stretch in so many directions that they \nsometimes feel they can't\u0014\n                      manage. Simultaneously, all are bombarded by \nmessages that\u0014\n                      urge them to spend more (and so, ultimately, \nwork more), to\u0014\n                      keep their homes cleaner (standards keep \nrising), and to\u0014\n                      improve themselves as lovers, investors, \nparents, or athletes.\u0014\n                      Supposedly to make all this possible, grocery \nstores stay open\u0014\n                      all night long, and entertainment options are \navailable around\u0014\n                      the clock. We live, says Schor, in \"an economy \nand society that\u0014\n                      are demanding too much from people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's a person to do? U.S. culture has some \nanswers ready.\u0014\n                      \"Quality time with your kids\" is the answer for \nparents. An\u0014\n                      exercise machine that reduces stress and burns \noff fat in only 20\u0014\n                      minutes, three times a week, is the answer for \nthe overwrought\u0014\n                      and the overweight. \"What you need is a good \nnight's sleep or a\u0014\n                      vacation\" is the answer one friend offers to \nanother. Each of\u0014\n                      these answers has value. Yet our circumstances \nrequire a\u0014\n                      stronger response, and we are too caught up in \nthe swirl of our\u0014\n                      lives to devise one. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In this situation, the historic practice of \nsetting aside one day a\u0014\n                      week for rest and worship promises peace to \nthose who\u0014\n                      embrace it. Whether we know the term Sabbath or \nnot, we the\u0014\n                      harried citizens of late modernity yearn for \nthe reality. We need\u0014\n                      Sabbath, even though we doubt that we have time \nfor it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the new century dawns, the practice of \nSabbath keeping may\u0014\n                      be a gift waiting to be unwrapped, a \nconfirmation that we are not\u0014\n                      without help in shaping the renewing ways of \nlife for which we\u0014\n                      long. This practice stands at the heart of \nJudaism, but it is also\u0014\n                      available to Christians. For many of us, \nreceiving this gift will\u0014\n                      require first discarding our image of Sabbath \nas a time of\u0014\n                      negative rules and restrictions, as a day of \nobligation (for\u0014\n                      Catholics) or a day without play (in memories \nof strict Protestant\u0014\n                      childhoods). Relocating our understanding of \nthis day in the\u0014\n                      biblical stories of Creation, Exodus, and \nResurrection will be\u0014\n                      essential if we are to discover the gifts it \noffers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unwrapping this gift also requires supporting \nunderworked\u0014\n                      Americans as they wonder what Sabbath keeping \nmight mean\u0014\n                      for them. One of the cruelest features of the \nAmerican economy,\u0014\n                      which asks too much of many people, is that it \ncasts numerous\u0014\n                      others aside, leaving them without sufficient \nwork. A\u0014\n                      Sabbath-keeping community would be a community \nin which this\u0014\n                      injustice would not occur. When Sabbath comes, \ncommerce\u0014\n                      halts, feasts are served, and all God's \nchildren play. The equal\u0014\n                      reliance of all people on the bounty and grace \nof God is\u0014\n                      gratefully acknowledged, and the goodness of \nweekday work is\u0014\n                      affirmed. Relationships that persist throughout \nthe week are\u0014\n                      changed in the process. As the great Jewish \nscholar Abraham\u0014\n                      Joshua Heschel said, \"The Sabbath cannot \nsurvive in exile, a\u0014\n                      lonely stranger among days of profanity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      THE SABBATH RHYTHM\u0014\n                      The way in which time is organized is a \nfundamental building\u0014\n                      block of any community. So basic is this that \nmost of us take the\u0014\n                      pattern we are used to for granted, as if it \nwere self-evident that\u0014\n                      time must be arranged in this way. For all the \nspiritual\u0014\n                      descendants of AbrahamJews, Christians, \nMuslimstime flows\u0014\n                      in seven-day cycles. Other cultures move \nthrough time in\u0014\n                      different cycles, however. In most ancient \nsocieties, rest days\u0014\n                      followed lunar phases or rotated on some number \nother than\u0014\n                      seven. During the French Revolution, \nanti-Christian leaders tried\u0014\n                      to weaken popular religious traditions by \nabolishing the\u0014\n                      seven-day week. The rhythms of the week subtly \npattern the\u0014\n                      days and years of our lives, and they are \nfilled with meaning. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Sabbatarian patternsix days of work, \nfollowed by one of\u0014\n                      restis woven deep into the fabric of the \nBible. The very first\u0014\n                      story of Hebrew and Christian Scriptures \nclimaxes on the\u0014\n                      seventh day, the very first time there was a \nseventh day. Having\u0014\n                      created everything, God rests, blesses this \nday, and makes it\u0014\n                      holy. In this way, Karl Barth has suggested, \nGod declares as\u0014\n                      fully as possible just how very good creation \nis. Resting, God\u0014\n                      takes pleasure in what has been made; God has \nno regrets, no\u0014\n                      need to go on to create a still better world or \na creature more\u0014\n                      wonderful than the man and woman. In the day of \nrest, God's\u0014\n                      free love toward humanity takes form as time \nshared with them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Later, God teaches the people of Israel to \nshare in the blessing\u0014\n                      of this day (Exod. 16). After bringing them out \nof Egyptian\u0014\n                      slavery into the wilderness, God sends them \nmanna,\u0014\n                      commanding them to gather enough each morning \nfor that day's\u0014\n                      food alone. Mistrusting, they gather more than \nthey need, but it\u0014\n                      rots. On the sixth day, however, they are told \nto gather enough\u0014\n                      to last for two days. Miraculously, the extra \ndoes not rot, and\u0014\n                      those mistrustful ones who go out on the \nseventh morning to get\u0014\n                      more find none. God is teaching them, through \ntheir own hunger\u0014\n                      and nature's provisions, to keep the Sabbath, \neven before\u0014\n                      Moses receives the commandments on Sinai. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When those commandments come, the Sabbath \ncommandment\u0014\n                      is the longest and in some ways the most \npuzzling. Unlike any of\u0014\n                      the others, it takes quite different forms in \nthe two passages\u0014\n                      where the Ten Commandments appear. Both \nversions require\u0014\n                      the same behaviorwork on six days, rest on \nonebut each\u0014\n                      gives a different reason. What is wonderful is \nthat each reason\u0014\n                      arises from a fundamental truth about God's \nrelationship to\u0014\n                      humanity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Exodus commandment to \"remember\" the \nSabbath day is\u0014\n                      grounded in the story of Creation. The human \npattern of six\u0014\n                      days of work and one of rest follows God's \npattern as Creator;\u0014\n                      God's people are to rest on one day because God \ndid. In both\u0014\n                      work and rest, human beings are in the image of \nGod. At the\u0014\n                      same time, they are not God but God's \ncreatures, who must\u0014\n                      honor God by obeying this commandment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Deuteronomy, the commandment to \"observe\" \nthe Sabbath\u0014\n                      day is tied to the experience of a people newly \nreleased from\u0014\n                      bondage. Slaves cannot take a day off; free \npeople can. When\u0014\n                      they stop work every seventh day, the people \nwill remember that\u0014\n                      the Lord brought them out of slavery, and they \nwill see to it that\u0014\n                      no one within their own dominion, not even \nanimals, will work\u0014\n                      without respite. Sabbath rest is a recurring \ntestimony against the\u0014\n                      drudgery of slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Together, these two renderings of the Sabbath \ncommandment\u0014\n                      summarize the most fundamental stories and \nbeliefs of the\u0014\n                      Hebrew Scriptures: Creation and Exodus, \nhumanity in God's\u0014\n                      image, and a people liberated from captivity. \nOne emphasizes\u0014\n                      holiness, the other social justice. Sabbath \ncrystallizes Torah's\u0014\n                      portrait of who God is and what human beings \nare most fully\u0014\n                      meant to be. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      LETTING NATURE BE\u0014\n                      As Sabbath crystallizes Torah, so \nSabbathShabbatis the\u0014\n                      heart of Judaism. When Jews who have become \ninattentive to\u0014\n                      their religion wish to deepen their observance, \nrabbis tell them\u0014\n                      with one voice: You must begin by keeping \nShabbat. But what\u0014\n                      does it mean to keep a day holy, to refrain \nfrom work, to honor\u0014\n                      God's creativity and imitate God's rest, to \nexperience the end of\u0014\n                      bondage? This question has been on the minds of \nobservant\u0014\n                      Jews, and in their hearts and actions, for \nmillennia. Following\u0014\n                      Exodus 31, in which God makes the Sabbath the \nsign of an\u0014\n                      irrevocable covenant with the people of Israel, \nJewish leaders\u0014\n                      have emphasized its special place in Jewish \nlife and heard in its\u0014\n                      rhythm the structure that has kept Jewish \nidentity alive amid\u0014\n                      terrible adversity. A saying affirms that \"more \nthan the Jews have\u0014\n                      kept Shabbat, Shabbat has kept the Jews.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many centuries of debate and cultural change \nhave shaped the\u0014\n                      law and liturgy of contemporary Shabbat \nobservance, which\u0014\n                      varies considerably from one branch of Judaism \nto another.\u0014\n                      Infusing the practice as a whole, however, is a \ntheology of\u0014\n                      Creation and Exodus, of holiness and \nliberation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In observant Jewish homes, Shabbat begins each \nFriday night at\u0014\n                      sundown as a woman lights the Sabbath candles. \nIt is a festive\u0014\n                      time; people dress up, the best tableware and \nfood are\u0014\n                      presented, guests are welcomed. In some \nfamilies, everyone\u0014\n                      turns toward the door, singing to greet \nShabbat, which Jewish\u0014\n                      hymns personify as a loving bride who brings \ninner delight and\u0014\n                      as a beautiful queen who gives order and peace. \nTraditional\u0014\n                      prayers are prayers of thanks; indeed, mourning \nis suspended\u0014\n                      in Shabbat liturgies. Many families sing or \nread together after\u0014\n                      the meal. They will gather again the next \nevening for another\u0014\n                      meal at which they will bid farewell to the \nholy day. Finally,\u0014\n                      parents will bless their children and give them \na bit of sweet\u0014\n                      spice so that the taste of Sabbath peace will \nlinger on their\u0014\n                      tongues. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jewish liturgy and law say both what should be \ndone on Shabbat\u0014\n                      and what should not. What should not be done is \n\"work.\"\u0014\n                      Defining exactly what that means is a long and \ncontinuing\u0014\n                      argument, but one classic answer is that work \nis whatever\u0014\n                      requires changing the natural, material world. \nAll week long,\u0014\n                      human beings wrestle with the natural world, \ntilling and\u0014\n                      hammering and carrying and burning. On the \nSabbath, however,\u0014\n                      Jews let it be. They celebrate it as it is and \nlive in it in peace and\u0014\n                      gratitude. Humans are created too, after all, \nand in gratefully\u0014\n                      receiving the gift of the world, they learn to \nremember that it is\u0014\n                      not, finally, human effort that grows the grain \nand forges the\u0014\n                      steel. By extension, all activities associated \nwith work or\u0014\n                      commerce are also prohibited. You are not even \nsupposed to\u0014\n                      think about them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What should be done? Specific religious duties \ndo exist,\u0014\n                      including worship at synagogue and reading of \nthe Torah. But\u0014\n                      the holiness of the Sabbath is also made \nmanifest in the joy\u0014\n                      people expect to experience on that day. It is \na good deed for\u0014\n                      married couples to have sexual intercourse on \nShabbat. Taking\u0014\n                      a walk, resting, talking with loved ones, \nreadingthese are\u0014\n                      good, too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To the eyes of outsiders, Jewish observance of \nthe Sabbath can\u0014\n                      seem like a dreary set of restrictions, a set \nof laws that don't\u0014\n                      bear any good news. According to those who live \neach week\u0014\n                      shaped by Shabbat, however, it is a practice \nthat powerfully\u0014\n                      alters their relationships to nature, work, \nGod, and others.\u0014\n                      Shabbat is not just law and liturgy; it is also \na shared way of life,\u0014\n                      a set of activities that becomes second nature, \na round of\u0014\n                      custom and prayer that the youngest child or \nthe oldest person\u0014\n                      can enter, a piece of time that opens space for \nGod. Over and\u0014\n                      over, Jewish authors say of Shabbat what those \nwho enter\u0014\n                      deeply into other religious practices also say: \nto experience its\u0014\n                      goodness, you must enter its activities. To \nfind Sabbath peace,\u0014\n                      you must keep the Sabbath holy. \"The real and \nthe spiritual are\u0014\n                      one, like body and soul in a living person,\" \nwrites Heschel. \"It is\u0014\n                      for the law to clear the path; it is for the \nsoul to sense the spirit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      SABBATH KEEPING IN A CHRISTIAN KEY\u0014\n                      Christians are fortunate when Jewish friends \ninvite us to come to\u0014\n                      a meal on a Friday evening, to keep Sabbath \nwith them. On our\u0014\n                      own, however, Christians cannot keep Sabbath as \nJews do. We\u0014\n                      know God most fully not through the perpetual \ncovenant God\u0014\n                      made with the Israelites at Sinai but through \nJesus Christ. Yet we\u0014\n                      also honor the Mosaic Commandments, and we \nstand in spiritual\u0014\n                      and historical kinship with the Jewish people, \nof whom Jesus was\u0014\n                      one. In an authentically Christian form of \nSabbath keeping, we\u0014\n                      may affirm the grateful relationship to the \nCreator that Jews\u0014\n                      celebrate each Sabbath, and we may share the \njoyful liberation\u0014\n                      from drudgery first experienced by the slaves \nwho left Egypt. But\u0014\n                      we add to these celebrations our weekly \nfestival for the source\u0014\n                      of our greatest joy: Christ's victory over the \npowers of death. For\u0014\n                      Christians, this victory makes of each weekly \nday of rest and\u0014\n                      worship a celebration of Easter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The first day of the week was special to \nChristians as an Easter\u0014\n                      day from the earliest days of their community. \nSunday, the day\u0014\n                      on which the disciples had first encountered \nthe risen Lord,\u0014\n                      became a day to gather, eat together, and \nrejoice. It was not in\u0014\n                      those years a day of rest, however; these \ngatherings happened\u0014\n                      after the workday was over, and for several \ndecades, Jews who\u0014\n                      became Christians continued to observe Shabbat \nas well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But these were years when Sabbath observance \nwas changing\u0014\n                      for Jews as well as for Christians. After the \ntemple in Jerusalem\u0014\n                      was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70, the \nrabbis who\u0014\n                      reformulated Jewish practice for the new \nsituation placed great\u0014\n                      emphasis on the Sabbath as a lasting sign of \nGod's unique\u0014\n                      covenant with Israel. So Jewish observance was \nbecoming more\u0014\n                      strict during this period. At the same time, \nChristianity was\u0014\n                      developing a separate identity from Judaism, \nand many people\u0014\n                      who were not Jewish were joining the church. \nGradually,\u0014\n                      Christians of Jewish background stopped \nattending synagogue\u0014\n                      and observing Jewish law. Over the years, \nSunday became their\u0014\n                      one-day-in-seven for both rest and worship. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Gospels say that Jesus observed the Jewish \nSabbath,\u0014\n                      though he ignored some laws that other teachers \nthought should\u0014\n                      restrict healing or eating in specific \nsituations of need. \"It is\u0014\n                      lawful to do good on the Sabbath,\" Jesus says \n(Matt. 12:12).\u0014\n                      Later, Christians continued to treasure the \nSabbath\u0014\n                      commandment, along with the other nine \ncommandments from\u0014\n                      Sinai. They also came to believe, however, that \nits meaning had\u0014\n                      changed within the new creation God began with \nChrist's death\u0014\n                      and resurrection. The holy day from now on, \ntherefore, was not\u0014\n                      the seventh but the \"eighth,\" the day on which \nthe future burst\u0014\n                      into the present. The appropriate response was \nto celebrate\u0014\n                      each Sunday with a feast of Communion, looking \nback to Jesus'\u0014\n                      passion and resurrection and forward to the \ngreat banquet that\u0014\n                      would occur at the end of time. The result has \nbeen centuries of\u0014\n                      Sunday worship, usually crowned by the \ncelebration of the\u0014\n                      Lord's Supper. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Building on this shared heritage, different \ngroups of Christians\u0014\n                      have shaped Sabbath keeping in different ways. \nThe strict\u0014\n                      Sabbath observance of the New England Puritans, \nwhich gave\u0014\n                      rise to \"blue laws\" in many American cities and \ntowns, influenced\u0014\n                      the structure of time for many groups in this \nsociety. Reformed\u0014\n                      churches of Dutch origin have anchored an \nAmerican subculture\u0014\n                      within which Sundays are still filled with \nfamily visits and\u0014\n                      theological debate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the other hand, some groups have been \nsuspicious of\u0014\n                      Sabbatarianism so strict that it might seem \nlegalistic (\"If\u0014\n                      anywhere the day is made holy for the mere \nday's sake, then I\u0014\n                      order you to work on it, to ride on it, to \nfeast on it, to do anything\u0014\n                      to remove this reproach from Christian \nliberty,\" Martin Luther\u0014\n                      declared) or have emphasized, like the Quakers, \nthat all time is\u0014\n                      holy with God. Sunday mass has been and \ncontinues to be\u0014\n                      central to Roman Catholics. A few groups, \nincluding the\u0014\n                      Seventh-day Adventists, have made Saturday \nobservance\u0014\n                      central to their identity.\u0014\n                      \u0014\nSEE: REDISCOVERING THE SABBATH - PART II\u0014",

Bass \u0014\n\u0014\n                      CLEARING THE ROADBLOCKS\u0014\n                      Even while the Bible, history, and the example \nof Judaism stir up\u0014\n                      a yearning for Sabbath within us, we are aware \nthat taking on a\u0014\n                      Sabbath rhythm would not be easyand pressures \nto work and\u0014\n                      spend are only part of the problem. Some other \nobstacles also\u0014\n                      make it difficult to retrieve this practice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One is figuring out how to make Sunday special \nwhen it is no\u0014\n                      longer protected by legislation and custom. The \narrangement of\u0014\n                      time by society as a whole is political, of \ncourse: how time is\u0014\n                      structured makes someone's life easier and \nsomeone's harder.\u0014\n                      Sunday first received special governmental \nrecognition in 321,\u0014\n                      when the emperor Constantine decreed it a day \nof rest\u0014\n                      throughout the Roman Empire. This spawned \ncenturies of\u0014\n                      government-sponsored Sabbath keeping. In recent \ndecades,\u0014\n                      however, the setting aside of Sunday as a \nspecial day has been\u0014\n                      losing force within American culture's politics \nof time. One\u0014\n                      reason is increasing sensitivity to religious \ndiversitya\u0014\n                      sensitivity pioneered by the Supreme Court in \ndecisions that\u0014\n                      forced employers to respect the Sabbath \npractices of Jews and\u0014\n                      Adventists. Today, not only the laws but also \nthe customs that\u0014\n                      once shielded Sunday from most commerce are \ndisappearing,\u0014\n                      and Christians' day of worship and rest is not \nautomatically\u0014\n                      \"free\" for church and family. Claiming its \nfreedom will take effort\u0014\n                      and perhaps even sacrifice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A second roadblock is the bad reputation many \ndevout\u0014\n                      Christians have given to the day of rest and \nworship. In the\u0014\n                      centuries after Constantine, church attendance \ncame to be\u0014\n                      required and profane activity to be banned on \nSundays, though\u0014\n                      in fact these rules were often ignored. When \nreligious reform\u0014\n                      swept through Europe in the sixteenth century, \nimproving the\u0014\n                      people's use of their day of rest was a concern \nof Protestant and\u0014\n                      Catholic leaders alike. In the ensuing \ncenturies, some\u0014\n                      Protestants worldwide not only required many \nhours of worship\u0014\n                      services each Sunday, but also made it \nvirtually impossible for\u0014\n                      absentees to have any fun. Sabbath keepers were \nkilljoys, it\u0014\n                      seemed. Little wonder that gloom still hangs \nover the Sunday\u0014\n                      memories of some from more stringent times. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today, economic forces are also nibbling away \nat the freedom of\u0014\n                      the day. In a vicious circle, people who spend \nmore hours at\u0014\n                      weekday jobs need the other days for shopping, \nwhich prompts\u0014\n                      businesses to hire more Sunday workers, who \njoin the growing\u0014\n                      percentage of the workforce who toil long, \nirregular hours, some\u0014\n                      trying desperately to make ends meet, others \nfor the sake of\u0014\n                      more shopping. For millions of workers, long \nSunday hours for\u0014\n                      rest and worship may be impossible within the \ncurrent system.\u0014\n                      People who know the Sabbath pattern of \ncreation, liberation,\u0014\n                      and resurrection nurture a dissatisfaction with \nthis system,\u0014\n                      however, and can work for change. Keeping \nSabbath, we grow\u0014\n                      in our longing for a system where all people \nhave work at a living\u0014\n                      wage, and time for rest and worship too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Will it be possible for twenty-first-century \nChristians who need\u0014\n                      Sabbath but also respect diversity, who need \nSabbath but also\u0014\n                      yearn for joy, who need Sabbath but also \nstruggle to make ends\u0014\n                      meet to enter the practice of Sabbath keeping? \nPerhaps. But\u0014\n                      this can only happen as we help one another \ndevelop new forms\u0014\n                      rooted in the enduring truths of Creation, \nliberation, and\u0014\n                      Resurrection. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      UNWRAPPING THE GIFT OF SABBATH\u0014\n                      In our situation, Sabbath keeping will require \na good deal of\u0014\n                      inventiveness. Tilden Edwards, an Episcopal \npriest who has\u0014\n                      explored this practice in real life and in a \nbook, urges\u0014\n                      contemporary Christians to be flexible, \nembracing not a renewed\u0014\n                      Sabbatarianism as much as a pattern of \"Sabbath \ntime.\" He\u0014\n                      recommends a combination of Sunday worship and \nplay with a\u0014\n                      regular rhythm of disciplined spiritual renewal \nduring the week.\u0014\n                      Eugene Peterson, a Presbyterian minister, \ndescribes the\u0014\n                      \"Sabbaths\" he and his wife observed every \nMonday, after their\u0014\n                      busiest day was over: a drive to the country, a \npsalm, a silent\u0014\n                      hike for several hours, a quiet evening at \nhome. Pastors are not\u0014\n                      the only ones who must work on Sundays; others, \ntoo,\u0014\n                      sometimes need to find ways of keeping Sabbath \non other days.\u0014\n                      Yet none of us should think that we can sustain \nSabbath\u0014\n                      keeping, whenever it happens, all by ourselves. \nWe need\u0014\n                      mutuality in this practice, which resists our \nordinary patterns in\u0014\n                      so many ways. We need to help one another \ndiscover this gift. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most often, Sundays will make the best \nSabbaths, and not only\u0014\n                      because our schedules are relatively open on \nthat day. Joining\u0014\n                      the assembly of Christians for the celebration \nof Word and\u0014\n                      sacrament will remind us that Sabbath keeping \nis not about\u0014\n                      taking a day off but about being recalled to \nour knowledge of\u0014\n                      and gratitude for God's activity in creating \nthe world, giving\u0014\n                      liberty to captives, and overcoming the powers \nof death. In\u0014\n                      addition, the friends with whom we worship can \nhelp us learn to\u0014\n                      rest and rejoice once the service is over. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What, besides churchgoing, is Christian Sabbath \nkeeping? The\u0014\n                      answer must be tailored to specific \ncircumstances and will vary\u0014\n                      considerably in different cultures and stages \nof life. It will be\u0014\n                      helpful in each circumstance to reflect on what \nis good and what\u0014\n                      is not. What is not good on Sabbath, or in \nSabbath time? We\u0014\n                      would do well to heed three millennia of Jewish \nreflection on the\u0014\n                      Sabbath commandment. Not good are work and \ncommerce and\u0014\n                      worry. To act as if the world cannot get along \nwithout our work\u0014\n                      for one day in seven is a startling display of \npride that denies the\u0014\n                      sufficiency of our generous Maker. To refrain \nfrom workingnot\u0014\n                      every day, but one in sevenopens the temporal \nspace within\u0014\n                      which glad and grateful relationship with God \nand peaceful and\u0014\n                      appreciative relationship with nature and other \npeople can grow.\u0014\n                      Refraining from work on a regular basis should \nalso teach us not\u0014\n                      to demand excessive work from others. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What about commerce? Buying and spending are \nclosely related\u0014\n                      to working too much; they depend on work, \ncreate the conditions\u0014\n                      for more work, and often are work. We could \nrefrain from\u0014\n                      shopping on Sundays, making a choice that might \ncomplicate\u0014\n                      the weekly schedule at first but should soon \nbecome a\u0014\n                      refreshing habit. And worry? It may be \ndifficult to banish cares\u0014\n                      from our minds altogether, but we can refrain \nfrom activities that\u0014\n                      we know will summon worryactivities like \npaying bills, preparing\u0014\n                      tax returns, and making lists of things to do \nin the coming week. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And what is good on a Christian Sabbath? Most \nimportant is\u0014\n                      joyful worship that restores us to communion \nwith the risen\u0014\n                      Christ and our fellow members of his body, the \nchurch. For\u0014\n                      Christians, every Sunday is Easter Sunday, a \ntime to gather\u0014\n                      together with song and prayer, to hear the Word \nproclaimed,\u0014\n                      and to recognize Christ in the breaking of the \nbread. It is a\u0014\n                      festival, a spring of souls, a day of freedom \nnot only from work\u0014\n                      but also from condemnation. At times, \nworshiping communities\u0014\n                      lose sight of this: hymns drag, elders judge, \nchildren fidget,\u0014\n                      fancy clothes constrain, and the minutes tick \nslowly by. In other\u0014\n                      congregations, joyful prayer and song burst \nthrough the seams\u0014\n                      of the worship service, and hours pass before \nanyone is ready\u0014\n                      to leave. The contrast suggests that we all \nneed to remember\u0014\n                      that Sunday worship is not just about \"going to \nchurch\"; it is\u0014\n                      about taking part in the activity by which God \nis shaping a new\u0014\n                      creation. It is a foretaste of the feast to \ncome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After worship, what many of us need most is \ntime with loved\u0014\n                      onesnot useful time for planning next week's \nschedulesbut\u0014\n                      time \"wasted\" on the pleasure of being \ntogether, perhaps while\u0014\n                      sharing our enjoyment of art, nature, or \nathletics. For others,\u0014\n                      and for all of us at certain points in our \nlives, hours of solitude\u0014\n                      beckon, hours for sleep, reading, reflection, \nwalking, and prayer.\u0014\n                      In addition, we might explore the long \ntradition of visiting the\u0014\n                      homebound or inviting lonely ones to our table \non the Christian\u0014\n                      Sabbath when the joy these occasions bring can \nbe experienced\u0014\n                      apart from the pressures of other appointments. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Churches must be careful, however, not to \ndevour Sabbath\u0014\n                      freedom with \"religious\" or charitable \nobligations. Filling Sunday\u0014\n                      afternoons with church committee meetings, for \nexample, is a\u0014\n                      terrible violation of this freedom. And it is a \nviolation that\u0014\n                      unfortunately seems to be increasing, precisely \nbecause of the\u0014\n                      pressures that Sabbath freedom specifically \nopposes. Of\u0014\n                      course, it is difficult to find time to meet \nduring the week, but part\u0014\n                      of the point of Sabbath keeping is to cause \nshifts in weekday\u0014\n                      priorities. In many churches, it is the people \non the committees\u0014\n                      who most need to be reminded to keep Sabbath! \nResisting the\u0014\n                      temptation to meet on Sunday would help them to \nsay to one\u0014\n                      another, \"God intends rest and liberation for \nyou during at least\u0014\n                      one seventh of your time.\" Eating, playing, and \ntaking delight in\u0014\n                      nature and one another in the hours after \nworship would be\u0014\n                      wonderful ways for congregations or groups \nwithin them to keep\u0014\n                      Sabbath. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      SABBATH FOR THE GOOD OF ALL\u0014\n                      Puritan Sabbath keepers agreed that \"good \nSabbaths make\u0014\n                      good Christians.\" They meant that regular, \ndisciplined attention\u0014\n                      to the spiritual life was the foundation of \nfaithfulness. Another\u0014\n                      dimension of the saying opens up if we imagine \na worshiping\u0014\n                      community helping one another to step off the \ntreadmill of\u0014\n                      work-and-spend and into the circle of glad \ngratitude for the gifts\u0014\n                      of God. Taken this way, good Sabbaths make good \nChristians\u0014\n                      by regularly reminding us of God's creative, \nliberating, and\u0014\n                      redeeming presence, not only in words but also \nthrough a\u0014\n                      practice we do together in response to that \npresence. But even\u0014\n                      beyond this, there are other benefits of \nSabbath keeping, and\u0014\n                      these could spill over to bless the whole \nworld. With a change,\u0014\n                      the saying acquires an applicability that \nreaches beyond the\u0014\n                      spiritual life alone, and beyond the Sabbath \npractices of Jews or\u0014\n                      Christians. Imagine this: \"Good Sabbaths make \ngood societies.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The practice of keeping Sabbath bears much \nwisdom for people\u0014\n                      seeking ways through the crises of these times \nand the stresses\u0014\n                      of contemporary life. \"The solution of \nmankind's most vexing\u0014\n                      problems will not be found in renouncing \ntechnical civilization,\u0014\n                      but in attaining some degree of independence \nfrom it,\" writes\u0014\n                      Heschel. Sabbath keeping teaches that \nindependence.\u0014\n                      Refraining from work on a regular basis is a \nway of setting limits\u0014\n                      on behavior that is perilous for both human \nwelfare and the\u0014\n                      welfare of Earth itself. Overworked Americans \nneed rest, and\u0014\n                      they need to be reminded that they do not cause \nthe grain to\u0014\n                      grow and that their greatest fulfillment does \nnot come through\u0014\n                      the acquisition of material things. Moreover, \nthe planet needs a\u0014\n                      rest from human plucking and burning and buying \nand selling.\u0014\n                      Perhaps, as Sabbath keepers, we will come to \nlive and know\u0014\n                      these truths more fully, and thus to bring \ntheir wisdom to the\u0014\n                      common solution of humanity's problems. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A good Sabbath would also make a good society \nby balancing\u0014\n                      the claims of work and celebration, for workers \nand celebrants of\u0014\n                      all sorts. In prayers at the beginning and end \nof Shabbat, Jews\u0014\n                      thank God for the blessing of work. Not working \non one day is\u0014\n                      tied to working on the other six; Sabbath \naffirms the value of\u0014\n                      work and interprets it as an important \ndimension of human\u0014\n                      identity. Sabbath keeping bears a longing that \nall human beings\u0014\n                      will have good work, as well as a longing that \nno one will be\u0014\n                      required to toil without respite. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rest and worship. One day a weeknot much, in a \nsense, but a\u0014\n                      good beginning. One day to resist the tyranny \nof too much or\u0014\n                      too little work and to celebrate with God and \nothers,\u0014\n                      remembering thereby who we really are and what \nis really\u0014\n                      important. One day that, week after week, \nanchors a way of life\u0014\n                      that makes a difference every day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dorothy C.

    "words": "Rwanda Struggles to \nMemorialize Painful Past\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the evening of Apri16, 1994, a surface-to-air missile shot down \nthe plane carrying Rwanda's president as it was landing in Kigali, \nthe country's capital. It is still not , ,known who fired the \nmissile, but the assassination was taken by extremist leaders of \nRwanda's Hutu majority as the signal to launch a carefully planned \ncampaign - to wipe out the country's Tutsi minority as well as \nmoderate Hutu leaders who might oppose this program of mass murder. \nOver the next 100 days, as many as \u0014\n800,000 people were murdered by the Rwandan military and Hutu \nmilitia, who were egged on by radio broadcasts encouraging Hutu to \nstamp out the Tutsi \"cockroaches.\" By the time the killing was \nstopped--when a Tutsi dominated rebel movement drove the killers out \nof the country--three quarters of the Tutsi population had been \nkilled.\u0014\n\u0014\nJerry Fowler, staff director of the Museum's Committee on Conscience, \nvisited where he pre-\u0014\nsented a paper on preventing future genocide. Below is a report on \nhis travels.\u0014\n\u0014\nMurambi is an unfinished technical school perched on one of Rwanda's \nmany beautiful hills. The campus consists of a main building with two \nstories, behind which are rows of long, single-story brick \nclassrooms. The rolling countryside around Murambi is lush, and the \nsurrounding hills are dotted with houses, banana groves, and \ncarefully tended fields.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, standing in front of the main building, all seems peaceful. \nBut in 1994, it was a scene of horror. Thousands of Tutsi who had \ntaken refuge here were murdered. It is reported that only one lived: \na little girl who survived by hiding under her father's body. ,\u0014\n\u0014\nI visited Murambi last November along with other participants in an \ninternational conference called \"Life After Death:' Organized by Dr. \nYael Danieli of the Group Project for Holocaust Survivors and Their \nChildren and, by Ibuka (Kinyarwanda for \"remember\"), an umbrella of \nRwandan survivor organizations, the conference brought together \nsurvivors of the Rwandan i genocide with survivors of the Holocaust \nand other genocides. Holocaust survivors included Hedi Fried, an \nAuschwitz survivor; Lea Balint, a hidden child during the Holocaust; \nand Robert Melson, whose remarkable tale of how his family survived \nby posing as Polish aristocrats is told in the book False Papers. ! \nOther international participants included scholars, journalists, and \nmedical i professionals from a number of countries. \u0014\n\u0014\nNeither I nor my international colleagues were prepared for what we \nsaw at Murambi.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaid out on pallets in the Murambi classrooms were partially \ndecomposed bodies of genocide victims. Babies and small children, \nolder children, adults-all disinterred from the mass graves where \nthey had been dumped immediately after the genocide in 1994. \nPervading everything was the smell of putrefaction, as the bodies \ncontinue to decompose.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy are these bodies kept like this? The answer is moving. The \nRwandan survivors fear that the genocide will be forgotten or, worse, \ndenied. The bodies are their evidence of what happened, and they fear \nthat burying them is burying the evidence.\u0014",

    "title": "RESCUE THOSE BEING LED AWAY",
    "words": "\"Rescue Those Being Led Away to Death\"\u0014\nThe Church, the Nazis, and the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nby David P. Gushee\u0014\nOf human passions and the actions that follow from them, Aristotle \nwrote the following famous words:\u0014\n\u0014\nFear and confidence and appetite and anger and pity and in general \npleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in \nboth cases not well; but to feel them at the right times, with \nreference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the \nright motive, and in the right waythis is characteristic of virtue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe five books under consideration in this review essay tell the \nstory of a time not so long ago when the churches of Jesus Christ \nfailed this Aristotelian test of virtue. When Adolf Hitler rose to \npower in Germany, initiated his anti-Jewish policies, launched World \nWar II, decided on extermination as the Final Solution of the Jewish \nQuestion in Europe, and pursued this policy without mercy for four \nlong years at the cost of six million Jewish lives, the churches \nfailed the moral test this escalating calamity imposed. In general \nand with notable exceptions, the churches felt too little anger and \ntoo little pity; directed that anger and pity too weakly and too \nlate, with mixed motives, and without adequate courage and vigor. The \nfailure of the Church (and the churches) continues today in its \ninadequately strenuous reckoning with what happened from 1933 to \n1945. These five books attempt to offer that historical reckoning, \nand generally do so well.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the besetting difficulties of writing or teaching about the \nNazi era is that the Holocaust tends to be the filter through which \nall data are interpreted. Every moment of the period, from the days \nof Hitler's rise to power until his death in 1945, is viewed with an \nawareness of Auschwitz, gas chambers, mass murder. This is perhaps \ninevitable. It certainly reflects an appropriate moral revulsion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose of us on the other side of the Holocaust find it \nextraordinarily difficult to imagine a world in which Auschwitz did \nnot yet exist. We follow the historical trajectory knowing that it \nends in the gas chambers. But the people and institutions whose \nactions we are studying did not, of course, know at the time that the \nstory would culminate in factories of mass murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we would seek to understand and evaluate the actions of Christians \nand church leaders in Germany and around the world in 1929 or 1933 or \neven 1941, we must attempt to reenter their pre-Holocaust world. We \nmust try to imagine Hitler, and perceptions of Hitler, before he \nbecame the paradigm of human evil. We also must undertake the arduous \ntask of understanding German and European political, cultural, and \nreligious conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nWolfgang Gerlach offers an excellent account of these conditions as \nthey existed in Germany in his important book And the Witnesses Were \nSilent, focusing on the response of the German Evangelical Church to \nNazism. Some of the same ground is covered in essays collected by \nRobert Ericksen and Susannah Heschel in their work, Betrayal. It is \nalso the background for The Popes and the Jews, David Kertzer's book \non the Vatican stance toward the Jews from 1814 until World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story begins at the end of the eighteenth century, with the \ntentative flowering of an Enlightenment-inspired tolerance toward \nJews in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. After centuries of \nreligiously inspired anti-Judaism, and the expression of that \nanti-Judaism through the political and social subordination and \nisolation of the Jews, many European nations slowly made provision \nfor the emancipation of Jews and their participation in civil society.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreed from both social and metaphorical ghettoization, some of the \nemancipated Jews of Germany and other nations joined vigorously in \nthe creation of what became the modern world. In philosophy and the \narts, business and government, Jews contributed energetically and \nquite visibly to the secularized liberal culture of the modernizing \nWestern nations, including Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nA social change of this magnitude perhaps inevitably creates a \nbacklash. Indeed, that very backlash, in the form of antimodernism, \nantiliberalism, and antisecularism, is with us to this day. It \ncharacterizes much Christian public rhetoric. The nineteenth and \nearly twentieth centuries saw this backlash begin and later \nintensify. It took a variety of forms, both traditional and strangely \nmodern. Traditional antimodernism yearned for the return of an \nearlier day of cultural and religious homogeneity, and was \nspearheaded especially by Christian leaders alarmed by growing \nsecularization. But at the same time, a modern antimodernism rooted \nin pseudoscientific racism began to flourish, offering Social \nDarwinian theories asserting the superiority of \"Aryans\" over other \nraces. The focus of these theories, the primary racial enemy, was the \nnewly emancipated Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the first third of the twentieth century, Gerlach shows, \nGerman Protestant leaders were susceptible to both religious \nanti-Judaism and modern anti-Semitism, though the former rather than \nthe latter held greater sway. Christian anti-Judaism had a very long \nhistory.\\1 The essay by Shelley Baranowski in Betrayal shows that \nantimodernist anti-Judaism, which blamed Jews for their contribution \nto deleterious social changes in the secularizing Germany of the era, \nwas an important theme in mainstream Protestant thought during the \nWeimar era. It dovetailed nicely with this older religious \nanti-Judaism and proved deeply appealing in German church life. \nGerlach documents the expression of anti-Judaism in the German \nProtestant press during this period, demonstrating that egregious \nexpression of anti-Jewish sentiment was quite common in the widely \nread Sunday papers as well as sermons and other popular outlets. A \nsection of a sermon by Basel theology professor Dr. Adolf Kberle \ncaptures the mood quite well:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe secular, areligious Jewhas followed the path of outrage against \nGod to its final consequence. In his heart, he has bid farewell to \nthe last bits of faith and reverence before God. His ideal is the \nspirit of the French revolution, the spirit of liberalism and \nmaterialism, Marxism and Bolshevism, but also, when possible, the \nspirit of unprincipled Mammonism and the unbridled greed of a \nCaesar-like world domination. He is everywhere where there is \nsomething to subvertwhether it be marriage and family, love for the \nFatherland or the church, discipline and order, chastity and decency, \nwherever there is something to gain.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDiscussing the Kberle sermon, Gerlach incisively concludes: \"As the \nstruggle of the German Evangelical Church with the Nazi regime began, \nsuch attitudes were widespread in the churches. These prejudices \nwould make any genuine Christian activism on behalf of the Jews \nvirtually impossible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not only Hitler's anti-Semitism that struck a chord in the \nchurches. The Nazi Party positioned itself in the 1920s and early \n1930s as the only force standing between Germany and utter social \ncollapse. The chaos of the tottering Weimar Republic is well-known, \nas is the economic crisis that helped Hitler's rise to power. Hitler \nand the Nazis promised to reestablish a strong central authority and \nbring order, restoring Germany's honor after the double humiliation \nof defeat and a punitively imposed peace, rebuilding the German \nmilitary, preventing Soviet-style communism from prevailing in \nGermany, and feeding a hungry people. The Nazis alsoand this is \noften overlookedpromised a return to traditional values, proclaimed \na strengthening of Germany's fragmented sense of national community, \nand demanded the suppression of enemies who undermined these bulwarks \nof traditional German identity. Nationalism, militarism, community, \nprosperity, law and order, tradition, authority, anti-communism: not \nonly in Germany have culturally conservative Christians found these \nthemes attractive.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it would be grossly unfair, as well as historically false, to \nsuggest that Christians in Germany simply welcomed Nazism with open \narms. Some did, to be sure, but many did not. The failure of the \nGerman church cannot be attributed solely to its own weakness. On the \ncontrary: from their beginnings, the Nazis regarded the \nchurchProtestant and Catholicas a formidable obstacle to achieving \ntheir goals. Gerlach and other scholars tend to downplay or ignore \nthis part of the story, which is illumined by documents from the Nazi \nera recently posted on the website of the Rutgers Journal of Law and \nReligion under the auspices of the Nuremberg Project. Compiled and \nedited by Rutgers law student Julie Seltzer Mandel, whose grandmother \nsurvived Auschwitz, the documents reveal that \"the destruction of \nChristianity was explicitly recognized as a purpose of the National \nSocialist Movement.\"\\2 Only the need to consolidate power on the way \nto totalitarian rule kept the Nazis from openly attacking the church \nat the outset.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo acknowledge this is not in any way to excuse the ultimate failure \nof the church in Germany (with some notable exceptions). At a time of \ngreat testing, it buckled. But as we look back on the contest between \nthose Christians and a brutal, implacable foe, we have no cause to \nfeel complacent.\u0014\nThe testing of the German church began with the rise of the Nazis in \nthe 1920s, but it began in earnest in 1933. On January 30 of that \nyear, Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor of Germany. Within six \nmonths, he had dismantled the parliamentary democracy and was ruling \nthe nation with near-dictatorial power. And within another year, by \nthe end of the summer of 1934, he had assumed total control.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1933, under Nazi pressure, an already existing federation of \nProtestant churches became the German Evangelical Church, a body that \nthe Nazis intended to control and manipulate just as they hoped to \ncoopt the Catholic Church in Germany. There are two primary stories \nto be told concerning the interaction of the German Evangelical \nChurch and the Hitler regime. One story concerns the church's \nresponse to the Nazi government's ever-increasing harassment and \npersecution of the Jews. The other has to do with the church's effort \nto protect its interests and discern its duties in relation to the \nnew regime. The stories are deeply interwoven, but not identical, and \nemphasis must rest on the latter, for that is precisely where the \nchurch placed its own emphasis.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese two stories should have been nearly identical. The Protestant \nchurches should have been able to discern that the attack on the Jews \nin German societythrough the street violence of Nazi hooligans, the \nmedia violence of Nazi propaganda, and the paper violence of Nazi \nbureaucratsposed the primary threat to the interests and the \nintegrity of established German Protestantism. What kind of \nChristianity stands by, fearful or complicit, and allows such evil to \ngo unchallenged?\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, not a single German church leader, with the arguable \nexception of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, saw that \"the Jewish Question\" was \nthe defining issue of the era as the era actually unfolded, beginning \nin 1933. The leading clerics and theologians in German Protestantism \nwho opposed Nazism in any way spent their time battling on two other \nfronts: the preservation of the institutional independence of the \nGerman Evangelical Church, and the maintenance of German Protestant \ntheological integrity. The increasingly constricted civil status of \nJews was viewed as a peripheral issue when compared to these more \nimmediate problemsif it was noticed at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"Jewish Question\" at first intersected with these two other \nfronts primarily through Nazi efforts to turn Germans with some \ndegree of \"Jewish blood\" into second-class citizens (before turning \nthem into noncitizens, and finally into dead bodies). The \"Aryan \nparagraph\" legislation of April 1933 forced the dismissal of all \n\"non-Aryan\" civil servants from their posts. While the Aryan \nparagraph did not in these early days apply to clergy or theological \nfaculty, some churchmen argued that the churches and theological \nschools should voluntarily and patriotically apply the paragraph to \nthemselvesthus dismissing any ministers or professors whom the state \nwould define as non-Aryan.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, if a church or seminary dismissed a competent leader \nbecause of an unbiblical racial category defined by the state, grave \nissues of institutional independence and ecclesial integrity would be \nraised. Or if the state required church leaders or faculty members to \nswear an oath of allegiance to Hitler; or if the state (or churchmen \nfiercely loyal to the state) required Christians of Jewish descent to \nattend separate churches, or to sit in separate sections, or finally \nto stop attending church at all; or if Christian doctrines would be \naltered so as to conform to the spirit of the ageall would raise \ncritical institutional and theological issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were in fact the very battles that preoccupied the most \ninsightful of Germany's Protestant leaders during much of the Nazi \nera. The Confessing Church, that section of German Protestantism that \nfor a time offered some opposition to Nazism, fought most of its \nbattles precisely over the institutional independence and doctrinal \npurity of the Church. A close reading of the well-known Barmen \nDeclaration of May 1934 clearly shows the centrality of these two \nthemes. That resistance, as well as the ham-handedness of the \nso-called German Christians (Christians attempting to accommodate \nNazism and Protestantism), led Hitler to wash his hands of Protestant \nchurch politics, eventually backing off from attempting a total \ncooptation of the church by the state. So the Confessing Church can \nfairly be said to have preserved more independence and integrity, at \nleast for a time, than almost any other sector of German society was \nable to do as the Nazi steamroller \"synchronized\" all aspects of \nGerman life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were certainly extraordinary theological battles to be fought. \nMost casual students of recent church history are unaware of the \nheretical depths to which nazified Protestantism sank. Some \nProtestant theologians went so far as to proclaim Hitler as God's \n\"gift\" and \"miracle, \" and fundamental elements of Christian doctrine \nwere compromised.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nadir of Protestant nazification is documented by Susannah \nHeschel in her chapter on the Institute for the Study and Eradication \nof Jewish Influence on German Religious Life. The institute, which \nopened in 1939, was led by a New Testament scholar, Walter Grundmann, \nwhose work is still quoted occasionally today. Grundmann, along with \nsome other learned biblical scholars, made the argument that Jesus \nwas not Jewish, but instead an \"Aryan\" who was Judaism's greatest \ncritic and in fact sought its destruction. The institute also \npublished a New Testament (the Old Testament, illegitimate by \ndefinition, was simply abandoned), a catechism, and a hymnbook, all \nscrubbed clean of any \"Jewish elements.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was surely providential that in such a time German Protestantism \nwas favored with a few leaders like Karl Barth, a man who knew heresy \nwhen he saw it and named it as such without hesitation. Thus nazified \nProtestantism did not permanently corrupt Christian doctrine in \nGermany, despite the profound theological confusion and outright \ncapitulation to Nazism of many distinguished clerics and theologians. \nFor saying a clear no at this point, we can thank the Confessing \nChurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, one reason for any limited success the Confessing Church was \nable to achieve was its decision to remain largely silent about the \never-worsening Jewish plight in Germany. With rare exceptions, voices \nwere raised on behalf of Jewish Christians but not, to coin a phrase, \non behalf of Jewish Jews. Indeed, Gerlach argues that whatever unity \nthe divided Confessing Church enjoyed would have been impossible if \nopposition to Nazi anti-Jewish policies had been made central and \nexplicit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was the case for several reasons, Gerlach contends, all of them \ninstructive. One was that even Confessing Church leaders were \ngenerally deeply in the grip of the same theological and cultural \nanti-Judaism that prevailed throughout German society. Further, \nConfessing Church leaders fell prey to what must now clearly be \nviewed as a misunderstanding of the relationship between church and \nstate, according to which the state is viewed as fully autonomous in \nits sphere and patriotic Christians are called to submit loyally and \nuncritically to government and its policies. Finally, Gerlach says, \nProtestant academics and other leaders were too insulated, \nexcessively focused on churchly self-interest and an ivory-tower \nconfessional purity. Writing theological statements and arguing about \nchurch order came much more naturally to these men than expressing \nand acting on a real-world concern for victimized human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were, however, a few who mobilized individual and institutional \nefforts on behalf of all Jews in need. Marga Meusel, who served as \ndirector of the Protestant social welfare office in the Berlin area, \npleaded as early as 1935 that the Confessing Church must resist Nazi \nracial distinctions and meet the material needs of increasingly \nimpoverished Jews in Germany. Gerlach's lengthy quotation from the \n1935 \"Meusel Memorandum\" is worth the price of the book. One example:\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are seized with cold dread when there can be people in the \nConfessing Church who dare to believe that they are justified, even \ncalled, to proclaim to the Jews that God's judgment and grace are \npresent in the current historical events and in the suffering that we \nhave brought on them. Since when does the evildoer have the right to \npass off his crime as the will of God?Let us take care that we do \nnot hide the outrage of our sins behind the holy shrine of the will \nof God.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot surprisingly, Meusel channeled her outrage into determined \nefforts at meeting the practical needs of Jews, including rescue \nefforts when that time came. She was not alone. Gerlach offers \nextensive discussion of the Protestant relief efforts that took place \nboth before and during the war. The most extensive operation was the \nso-called Grber office in Berlin, established by the Confessing \nChurch as its central relief operation.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the leadership of Pastor Heinrich Grber, this office undertook \nsignificant relief efforts, first legally and finally illegally, and \nultimately, Gerlach says, at the cost of the lives of many of its 55 \nstaff, many of them remarkably courageous women. The office helped \nwith legal emigration efforts, offered social assistance and legal \nsupport, undertook education for Jewish children barred from public \nschools, provided food and medicine, and so on. Once the deadly \nthreat of deportation and death loomed, the office turned to illegal \nefforts including passport and document forgery and all manner of \nrescue work. The office was shut down by the Nazis in late 1940, but \nthis just sent the effort underground. Rescue continued till the very \nend of the war. Grber's efforts, and those of other documented \nrescuers from the Confessing Church, have earned their designation as \n\"Righteous Gentiles\" by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust museum and \nmemorial. And yet, like putting a finger into a leaking dike, the \nGrber office and related efforts saved but a small number of lives \namid the torrent of death that flooded Germany during the Holocaust. \nIt was not enough to efface the failure of German Protestantism's \nall-too-silent witnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe books by David Kertzer, Michael\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer, and Susan Zuccotti explore essentially the same terrain, this \ntime on the Catholic side. Kertzer traces Vatican attitudes toward \nJews primarily from 1814 to 1939. Phayer attempts to cover the \noverall approach of the Catholic Church toward the Jews from 1930 \nuntil Vatican II, and Zuccotti offers a detailed account of Pope Pius \nXII's response to anti-Jewish policies, and finally the Holocaust \nitself, as these events unfolded in Italy. Guenther Lewy also offers \na valuable review of the overall response of the Catholic Church to \nNazism in a chapter in Betrayal. Together the discussions make a \nsignificant contribution to our understanding of what has become a \nhighly controversial issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor these books do not enter a vacuum. The context in which they are \noffered is the so-called Pius XII debate, which shows few signs of \nslowing after several years of white-hot historiography and polemic. \nStimulated afresh in 1999 with the release of John Cornwell's deeply \nflawed but widely publicized Hitler's Pope, the debate primarily \nconcerns how to evaluate the wartime action and/or inaction of the \nworldwide leader of the Roman Catholic Church. This debate cannot be \nregarded as resolved, or even resolvable, in part because the Vatican \nhas refused to open its archives fully for historical inspection. Yet \nPhayer and Zuccotti, both of whom take stances largely critiquing \nPius XII, believe that the documents currently available are \nsufficient to offer at least a provisional accounting. I will attempt \nhere to draw distinctions between those issues that can be regarded \nas settled and those that remain most intensely disputed.\u0014\n\u0014\nKertzer's book offers a devastating description of Vatican attitudes \nand actions toward Jews for the 120 or so years that preceded the \nrise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe. Drawing on many Vatican \ndocuments previously unavailable to researchers, and quoting them \nfreely and to astonishing effect, Kertzer essentially demonstrates \nwhat his title suggests: that the popes were with rare exceptions \nsimply \"against the Jews\" from 1814 until the Holocaust period itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs to why this was the case, Kertzer's argument tracks quite closely \nwith that of Gerlach. The short answer is simply that Jews were \nviewed as the adversaries of a Christian civilization that was \ncollapsing under the pressure of modernity. In its longing for a \nreturn to a vanishing world, the churchboth Catholic and \nProtestantheaped opprobrium on the Jews, who were seen as the \nprimary beneficiaries of the new order. In its deep desire to return \nto \"the good old days,\" the church both retrieved and manufactured a \nrange of nasty anti-Jewish smears in hopes of winning the fight for \nWestern (Christian) civilization.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most significant contribution of Kertzer's book is to \nchallenge the distinction between theological anti-Judaism and racial \nanti-Semitism. Many Christians who have become aware of the painful \nhistory of Christian hatred of Jews have sought to defend the church \nby claiming that Nazi anti-Semitism was a modern brew that bore \nlittle resemblance to Christian anti-Jewish polemic, which was not \nracist but theological.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Kertzer shows from Catholic documents of the late nineteenth \nand early twentieth centuries that nearly every anti-Semitic theme \nthe Nazis used in the 1920s and 1930s could be found in the Catholic \npress (including journals and papers very close to the Vatican) \neither during the same period or just before. In Kertzer's summary, \nthese included the following:\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a secret Jewish conspiracy; the Jews seek to conquer the \nworld; Jews are an evil sect who seek to do Christians harm; Jews are \nby nature immoral; Jews care only for money and will do anything to \nget it; Jews control the press; Jews control the banks and are \nresponsible for the ruination of untold numbers of Christian \nfamilies; Jews are responsible for communism; Judaism commands its \nadherents to murder defenseless Christian children and drink their \nblood; Jews seek to destroy the Christian religion; Jews are \nunpatriotic, ever ready to sell their country out to the enemyJews \nmust be segregated and their rights limited.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther, Kertzer is able to document the appearance of racial \nanti-Semitismthe idea that Jews are biologically inferior due to \ntheir inborn racial makeupin the Catholic press. Reading the \ndocuments Kertzer so amply quotes, it seems that the only real \ndifferences between Catholic anti-Semitic literature of the period \nand that of \"secular\" anti-Semites was that the former rejected \nviolence and murder, held out hope for conversion, and sought to \nprotect the rights of ethnically Jewish Catholics. Those differences \nare not negligible, but there can be no doubt that Catholicslike \ntheir Protestant counterpartscontributed to the toxic brew of hatred \nthat reached its logical conclusion in the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer and Zuccotti show that Rome's stance during the war on \"the \nJewish Question\" was deeply shaped not only by theology and this \nheritage of anti-Semitism but also by the unique political status of \nthe Vatican. It is often forgotten today that the Vatican is actually \na state and is treated as such in international law. The Vatican's \nself-understanding and role in the world are deeply affected by its \npolitical identity as a religious mini-state (which had once been a \nlarger and more influential collection of Papal States), and this was \nespecially true in the chaotic and frightening days of the 1930s and \n1940s. The Vatican during this period was concerned with its own \npolitical interests as well as international Catholic interests; in a \nvery real and deeply ingrained sense, it also viewed itself as the \ntrustee of historic Christian civilization.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Pius XII, who took office in 1939 on the eve of World War II, \nwas profoundly steeped in a geopolitical understanding of the Vatican \nand the papacy. His ascent up the ranks of the Vatican hierarchy was \nundertaken through the Vatican Foreign Office, including twelve years \nas a papal nuncio in Germany (191729) and then as Vatican Secretary \nof State, the role which he held for over nine years until he was \nelected pope. Pius XII enjoyed the life of the diplomat and was \nperceived by many of his peers as consummately skilled in the work. \nPerhaps fatefully, he also came to love Germany and had many German \naides.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer argues that Pius XII's understanding of geopolitics and of \nhimself as a diplomat tragically misshaped his priorities during \nWorld War II. For much of the war, Pius appears to have nurtured the \nhope of playing a pivotal diplomatic role in brokering peace between \nthe warring parties and preserving a remnant of Christian Europe (the \nvery role his predecessor Benedict XV undertook during World War I), \nand in general placed a strong emphasis on behind-the-scenes \ndiplomacy. He believed his task was to remain neutral so that all \nparties could turn to him as an honest broker. The pope's ardent \nanti-communism, Phayer argues, also played a major part in his \napproach to decision making before and during World War II, leading \nhim consistently to downplay the danger of German Nazism vis-a-vis \nthat posed by Soviet communisma claim that pro-Pius historians \nreject.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs leader of the worldwide Catholic Church, one of Pius XII's \npriorities was to protect the church's political interests and rights \nwherever he perceived them as threatened. Here he was in complete \ncontinuity with his predecessors. This, according to Phayer, made him \nreluctant to critique the anti-Jewish collaboration, and sometimes \ndeadly indigenous anti-Semitism, of Catholic-led states such as \nCroatia, Slovakia, and Vichy France. It also contributed to his \nreticence to press German Catholics to resist Hitler. Phayer argues \nthat he feared weakening the Catholic Church in Germany or provoking \na crisis of conscience for German Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Phayer shows, as does Zuccotti, that when the war came to \nItaly, Pius XII was deeply concerned about the possible destruction \nof the Vatican and its treasures, and maneuvered carefully to \npreserve at least the appearance of neutrality and thus avoid giving \nthe Nazis any pretense for overrunning Vatican City, the symbolic and \ntemporal capital of Roman Catholicism. Pro-Pius historians emphasize \nthat Hitler considered several plans to do exactly what Pius feared, \nincluding schemes involving the pope's abduction or assassination, \nand that Pius was warned about such deliberations.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Phayer and Zuccotti show that few people in the world had better \ninformation than the pope did about the annihilation of European \nJewry as it was happening. Both argue that the pope never offered a \nclear public word of condemnation of this butchery. Pro-Pius \nhistorians argue to the contrary that on several occasions Pius \ndecried mass killings on the basis of nationality and race, and that \nin doing so Pius was clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews while \n(admittedly) never naming them specificallyand that the Germans \ncertainly understood what he was talking about at the time, as did \nthe international press in its reports. Moreover, some historians \nargue that nothing in the Vatican's institutional history or the \npope's personal background served to foster the kind of very \nspecific, morally outraged public protests the pope's critics so \nardently wish for. This was simply not the way the papacy operated.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Phayer, Pius did nothing to disseminate the information \nabout the Holocaust that he did have, so that others might intervene \neven if he himself did not. He neither publicly nor privately \ndirected Catholic clergy or laypeople to resist the Nazis and rescue \nJews. Neither did he direct German, Croatian, French, Italian, \nSlovakian, or other Catholics to refuse to carry out mass killings or \nparticipate in any way in the killing apparatus. Zuccotti argues that \nthe pope appears to have permitted rescue to occur in his diocese, \neven in Vatican City, but not to have encouraged it either there or \nanywhere, even when directly asked his opinion. This issue continues \nto be bitterly disputed, as pro-Pius historians argue that the pope \nat least encouraged rescue and perhaps can be said to have been a \nrescuer himself, given the indisputable presence of Jews in hiding on \nVatican properties.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer and Zuccotti both fault the engagement of the pope and his \nrepresentatives with Germany and collaborating nations. They argue \nthat while papal representatives approached Nazi and collaborationist \ngovernments from time to time with protests against various \nparticular anti-Jewish measures, these overtures were in general \ndilatory and half-hearted, almost always lacking the passion that \nwould have been even remotely fitting to the gravity of events. \nDefenders of Pius read the historical record differently, commenting \nin particular on the Third Reich's perception of the Vatican as one \nof the staunchest public and diplomatic critics of Nazi anti-Jewish \npolicy.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer and Zuccotti offer inspiring tales of rescue efforts \nundertaken by thousands of Catholic laypeople and clerics in Italy. \nThis record is commendable, and it is good to see the depth and \nbreadth of Catholic rescue. Yet these authors differ from papal \ndefenders in concluding that the rescuers acted without any explicit \nauthorization or even exhortation from their leader, dismissing \npurported evidence to the contrary as not credible.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhayer also depicts the pope's postwar activities as blameworthy. He \nclaims that the pope sought clemency for some convicted German war \ncriminals and proved uncooperative in extraditing war criminals \nactually hiding out on Vatican properties. He appointed Nazi and \nCroatian fascist sympathizers to Vatican positions, where they were \nable to aid and abet war criminals in escaping prosecution. Pius \ncriticized the denazification process in Germany after the war, as \nwell as the efforts of some Catholics to press for restitution and \nrepentance by Germany and by Catholics in Germany. He refused to \nspeak out on the continuing dangers of anti-Semitism when violence \nagainst Holocaust survivors was being perpetrated in largely Catholic \nPoland, and elsewhere, after the war. He opposed the birth of the \nstate of Israel in 1948 and Jewish emigration to that state. And yet, \npro-Pius historians remind us that during and after the war, and with \na special outpouring at the time of his death in 1958, well-known \nJews praised Pius XII for his actions on behalf of the Jewish people \nin their darkest hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can recall few instances where the opinion of reputable historians \nhas been as deeply divided as it is in this case. The Pius XII \ndebate, narrowly considered, will have to be considered unresolved. \nYet these books do show, so lamentably, that the role of Christian \nanti-Semitism in helping lay the foundation for the Holocaust is \nclearer than ever.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we conclude that both the Protestant and Catholic churches helped \nprepare the way for the Holocaust and failed to offer adequate \nresistance to that mass slaughter as it occurred, have we done \nanything other than add another count to the overwhelming case for \nhuman and even Christian moral failureas if more evidence for the \ndoctrine of sin were needed?

    "words": "April 27, 2002, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion for Dummies\u0014\nBy FRANK RICH\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said they're calling us child molesters. He said that will never \nwash off.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose words were spoken to an official investigative committee this \nyear, though not, it seems, by any of the clergymen who have spent \ndecades running a protection racket for child molesters within the \nRoman Catholic Church. The speaker was instead that sparkling \nexemplar of corporate ethics circa 2002, Jeffrey Skilling. He was \ntelling Congress of a final conversation with J. Clifford Baxter, the \nshame-filled fellow Enron executive who committed suicide just as the \nworld was learning how America's \"most innovative company\" (as \nFortune put it) had engaged in shadowy partnerships designed to rape \nits employees and shareholders. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Baxter was, of course, speaking figuratively about the public \noutcry against Enron. In the case of the church the accusations are \nliteral, and only the church itself, by its own actions, can \ndetermine when the stain will wash off. A Wall Street Journal/NBC \nNews poll finds that the church's standing among Catholic and \nnon-Catholic Americans alike is crashing  a crisis of confidence \"as \nbad as anything that I've seen,\" according to the pollster, Peter \nHart, who reaches to Watergate for a historical parallel. And that \npoll was taken before Wednesday's communiqu from Rome, which, to \nborrow a phrase from Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, allows the \nchurch perhaps the last thing it needs  \"wiggle room\"  in punishing \nits child molesters.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet sexual parasitism within the priestly ranks is far from a new \nstory. Last weekend \"60 Minutes\" rebroadcast an expos of a former \narchbishop of Santa Fe that it had first broken nine years ago. Nine \nyears before that, the Rev. Thomas Doyle, then a canon lawyer at the \nVatican Embassy in Washington (and now an American Air Force \nchaplain), helped draft a prescient protocol intended to counter the \npriesthood's looming child-abuse crisis. This time, though, the \nscandal has captured the broad public imagination as never before, \nand perhaps with good reason. The cover-ups, blame-shifting and \narrogance that have emanated from church leaders in recent months \nhave an all too familiar, and secular, ring. The cardinals' rhetoric, \nrighteous in style but often self-serving in content, seems like a \nmetaphor for too much of the behavior we've seen from American \nreligious, political and business leaders alike since the nation's \nsupposed moral turning point of Sept. 11.\u0014\n \u0014\nWhat has been most shocking about the church scandal so far is not \nthe revelation that some priests prey on minors but that their bosses \nare looking out for No. 1 (and I don't mean Him) rather than their \nvictims. \"Mistakes may have been made,\" said Cardinal Edward Egan of \nNew York  but always by somebody else. Instead of taking \nresponsibility for their own failings, American cardinals have made a \nhymnal out of the Enron playbook. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust as Linda Lay went on TV to testify that \"God is good\" and \nattribute her husband's woes to the media's propensity for wreaking \n\"havoc and destruction in people's lives,\" so Cardinal William Keeler \nof Baltimore (among others) tries to deflect attention from clerical \nsins by chastising \"the media of the United States\" for their \n\"feeding frenzy.\" Much as Enron first tried to pin its wrongdoing on \nArthur Andersen, so Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston at first \nrationalized his cover-up of serial pedophiles by lamenting \"how \ninadequate our record-keeping has been.\" Other Catholic leaders have \nturned to other scapegoats  the \"sexual anarchy\" of the 1960's, the \nalleged depravity of America in general and, inevitably, \nhomosexuality  to avoid accountability for a plague of abuse that is \ndocumented at least as far back as 1950, that spans the globe from \nIreland to Africa to Australia and that is not caused by (or \nexclusive to) any sexual orientation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's depressing when the nation's spiritual mentors sound like \nbusinessmen fending off indictment, whether at Enron or Merrill Lynch \n or, worse, like buck-passing politicians on the order of that \npreacher's son Gary Condit. In recent months, this seems to be a \npattern. Not until weeks after the latest round of Richard Nixon Oval \nOffice recordings were released  and only after a storm of reprimand \n did Billy Graham take full responsibility for his anti-Semitic \nremarks about \"the Jews.\" Even so, his son and successor, Franklin \nGraham, soon rescinded his father's mea culpa by asserting that the \ntaped quotes had been taken out of context and meant to refer to \n\"liberalism,\" not Jews. The younger Mr. Graham's disingenuousness is \nof a piece with Jerry Falwell's and Pat Robertson's pseudo-apology \nfor their televised remarks in which they tried to pin the Sept. 11 \nattacks on the same all-purpose culprits (gays, feminists) whom some \nCatholic leaders now hope will take the fall for abusive priests and \ntheir enabling higher-ups.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the abdication of personal responsibility by some religious \nleaders in America is only half of the confused moral equation since \nSept. 11. If too many religious leaders sound like politicians right \nnow, the flip side is that more and more politicians in power are \nrushing into the ensuing vacuum. They exploit the exigencies of war \nto sound like clergymen, seizing religious language to veil partisan \npublic policies in a miasma of ersatz godliness. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the exception of Tom DeLay  who this month announced that \"only \nChristianity offers a way to live in response to the realities that \nwe find in this world\"  no politician in power has ratcheted up this \nrhetorical religiosity louder than John Ashcroft. In a February \nspeech he declared, \"We are a nation called to defend freedom  a \nfreedom that is not the grant of any government or document, but is \nour endowment from God.\" So much, then, for that trifling document \nthat defines our freedoms, a k a the Constitution. By wrapping \nhimself in sanctimony as surely as he wrapped the Justice \nDepartment's statue of Justice in a blue curtain, our attorney \ngeneral is trying to supersede civil law on the grounds that he's \nexercising the Lord's will whatever he does. Last week a U.S. \ndistrict judge had to intervene and reprimand him for his repeated \nefforts to criminalize doctors who are obeying a law allowing \nphysician-assisted suicide that has twice been approved by Oregon's \nvoters.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Bush's penchant for stark religious terminology has waned \nin the international arena now that he has lost his innocence in the \nMiddle East. He has yet to brand the Israelis, the Palestinians or, \nfor that matter, the Saudis \"evildoers.\" But on the domestic front he \nhas joined Mr. Ashcroft in pumping up the volume of his preening \nsanctimony, referring to the Almighty so frequently that He is \nbecoming his de facto running mate for 2004. The president's push to \nban therapeutic cloning is typically cloaked in a stated reverence \nfor human life, without any humble recognition of the fact that he is \nplaying God in determining that the \"life\" of a blastocyst, a tiny \ncluster of cells, is worth more than the lives of those suffering \nfrom juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases \nwhose remedies could be hastened by the most comprehensive medical \nresearch.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we learned anything from Sept. 11, surely it is that there is a \nreason to worry when politicians hijack religion  just as we've \nlearned from the church's scandal of the dangers that abound when \nreligious leaders value political self-preservation over protecting \nthe defenseless in their flock. But a half-year later, the \noverarching imperatives of that once-indelible morning are being \ndevalued. In his latest effort to give himself some spiritual wiggle \nroom, Cardinal Law said last weekend that \"Some have likened the \nsituation facing the Catholic Church in Boston and across the country \nto last year's Sept. 11 tragedy\"  as if there were an equivalence \nbetween the slaughter of thousands of innocent victims by terrorists \nand the destruction of a religious institution brought on by its own \npriests' practice of victimizing their young charges. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was heroism along with tragedy on Sept. 11, and it was often \ninformed by true religious values: self-sacrifice, concern for \nothers, accountability for one's own actions. Among the first \ncasualties that morning was a Fire Department chaplain who hurried \nfrom his base at the St. Francis of Assisi church on 31st Street to \nthe stricken World Trade Center so that he could minister to the \ndying. That hero, it should be recalled, was Mychal Judge, a Catholic \npriest, who, not that it should matter, happened to be gay. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company | Privacy Information \u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014",

    "words": "Running with Jonah \u0014\nDo we really want to be closer to God? \u0014\nby Mark Buchanan | Now the word of the Lord came to Jonahsaying, \"Go \nat once to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for \ntheir wickedness has come up before me.\" But Jonah set out to \nfleefrom the presence of the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the people of Nineveh believed God. But this was very \ndispleasing to Jonah, and he became angry. He prayed to the Lord and \nsaid, \"O Lord! Is not this what I said while I was still in my own \ncountry? That is why I fledat the beginning; for I knew that you are \na gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in \nsteadfast love, and ready to relent from punishing. Jonah 1:13; \n3:5, 4:12, NRSV \u0014\n\u0014\nGive us a sign.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, some Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus for a \nmiraculous sign. Impress us, Jesus. Convince us, Jesus. We've heard \nrumors of your sleight-of-hand with water and wine, your conjuring \ntricks with bread and fish, your banishing stunts with demons and \npigs. The word's out that you're Messiah: but we demand credentials. \nGive us a sign. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus rebukes them: \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a \nmiraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the \nprophet Jonah\" (Matt. 12:39, NIV). \u0014\n\u0014\nA curious sign, this. Why not the sign, say, of Elijah? Now there was \na prophetcalling down heaven's fire, outrunning horses, staring down \nkings. Why not Isaiah? A towering, glowering man, I picture him, all \nsinewy muscle and wild-eyed zeal. Why not Daniel? Serene and shrewd \nin the face of folly and evil, holding tight the truth amid a world \nglutted with pagan traps and trappings. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jesus said Jonah: the runt prophet, the rebel prophet, the \nsulking prophet. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the sign of Jonah is two-fold: it's an image of Jesus' \ndying and rising (Matthew's emphasis, 12:3840); and it's a warning \nto the Israelites that, though even wicked Nineveh repented at the \npreaching of Jonah, they are in danger of refusing one \"greater than \nJonah\" (Luke's emphasis, 11:2932). \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I wonder. For Jesus to compare himself with Jonah at first \noffends. Jonah was a rebellious, petty, sullen man, self-serving and \nself-protecting. His sense of what matters was terribly skewed. But \nmaybe that's exactly the point: the sign of Jonah is an image, not \njust of dying and rising, not just of hearing and heeding, but also \nof incarnation and crucifixionof Jesus coming to be with us, to \nshare in our fallen humanity, to empty himself, to become sin for us. \nJesus, just as he identified with us in the stable and on the cross, \nchose as his mascot the prophet most like you and me. \u0014\n\u0014\nJonah is us. Those other prophetsso free and bold, so daunting and \nundaunted, so flinty and unflinchingthey are larger than life. The \nstory of how God spoke to them, how they spoke to God, how they spoke \nfor God: it's as intimidating as it is inspiring. Who can equal them? \nWho can walk astride the earth like Isaiah? Who can command and \ndemand and reprimand with Elijah's authority? Who can endure the \nheavy hand of God like Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Hosea? Those prophets are \nmen apart. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then there's Jonah. See him: hands plowed deep into his pant \npockets, shoulders folded down in a perpetual slouch, face cast in a \nhardened sneer. He complains about the weather. It's too hot or too \ncold, too wet or too dry. He complains about the government. He \ncomplains about his neighbors. He complains about his church. The \nmusic's loud. The preaching's dull. The young people leave messes, \nthey're unruly and irreverent. The services go on and on. He doesn't \ncomplain about his neighbor's cat: instead, he poisoned it. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah is who we want to be. Jonah is who we are. Jonah is lord of \nthe half-hearted, tribal chieftain of those who want God only on \ntheir own terms. I don't find him attractive: I find him all too \nfamiliar. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod calls him to rise up, go. He rises up and goes all right: \"But \nJonah set out to fleefrom the presence of the Lord\" (Jon. 1:3, 10, \nNRSV). He's not simply evading the task: he's fleeing God. And now we \ntouch something in Jonah that is elemental, part of the roots of our \nhumanness: we really don't want God. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor years, I've read devotional books and gone to workshops and \nconferences designed to deepen my life in God. I have an entire shelf \nof books just on prayerits purposes, its nature, its aims. I have \ngleaned a litany of techniques for praying with focus and passion. I \nhave learned what to relinquish and what to embrace as I approach \nprayer and practice it. Reading these books has been an \napprenticeship to masters. If I had spent similar time and effort \nlearning, say, the craft of violin-making, I would by now be able to \nmake curvaceous, dark-burnished, sweet-toned instruments that wept or \nlaughed, effortlessly, just to touch them. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I'm not praying much better. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter I had read many of these books, I realized something. The books \nmostly assumed, and so did I, that I really wanted to get closer to \nGod. The basic conviction behind those who write such books, and \nthose who read them, is that every Christian's primary stance toward \nGod is Isaiah-like: \"Here I am. Send me!\" But that is not my primary \nstance. Nor is it probably yours. My primary stanceand yours \nperhapsis Jonah-like: \"But Jonah set out to fleefrom the presence \nof the Lord.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do Jonahs do that? \u0014\n\u0014\nJonah had good historical reasons, good personal reasons, for not \nwanting to go to Nineveh. Nineveh was the capital of Assyria. \nAssyrians were cruel with bloodthirst, both capricious and calculated \nin doing evil. Their specialty was sacking and burning. They were a \nlooming threat for the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and within 70 \nyears of Jonah's ministry would carry Israel into exile. They were \nnot good people. Think of someone who has hurt you, betrayed you, who \nthreatens to devour you. Think, if you can, of someone you hate, or \nhave good reason to. That's an Assyrian. Jonah was sent to their \ncapital. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Jonah confirms a dark suspicion we have about God. The \nsuspicion is, God will always ask me to do the thing I least want to \ndo, go to the very last place I desire to go. If I say I won't go to \nthe prairies or India, God will send me there. If I tell him I hate \nBosnians, or Tutsis, or French Canadians, that's exactly to whom \nhe'll send me. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet's state the suspicion in theological terms: God is a hard \ntaskmaster, harvesting where he has not sown, gathering where he has \nnot scattered seed. Maybe, in our bones, most of us fear God in the \nway we fear cyclones and Cyclopes, tigers and tyrants: not a \nwisdom-giving fear, but a skittish, nerve-sheering fright. God is out \nto get us. God wants to send us to the hellish Ninevites, and if we \nbolt, to loose the hell of storms and swallowing sea beasts upon us. \nWhy, except that he's a demanding boss? \u0014\n\u0014\nI heard Paul Yonggi Cho speak a few years back. Yonggi Cho is pastor \nof the largest church in the world. Several years ago, as his \nministry was becoming international, he told God, \"I will go anywhere \nto preach the gospelexcept Japan.\" He hated the Japanese with \ngut-deep loathing because of what Japanese troops had done to the \nKorean people, and to members of Yonggi Cho's own family, during \nWorld War II. The Japanese were his Ninevites. But God called him to \npreach in Japan. Oh, you're a hard one, harvesting where you have not \nsown. He went, but he went bitter. The first speaking engagement was \nto a conference of 1,000 Japanese pastors. He stood up to speak, and \nwhat came out of his mouth was this: \"I hate you, I hate you, I hate \nyou.\" And then he broke and wept. He was both brimful and desolate \nwith hatred. At first one, then two, then all 1,000 pastors stood up. \nOne by one they walked up to Yonggi Cho, knelt at his feet, and asked \nforgiveness for what they and their people had done to him and to his \npeople. As this went on, God changed Yonggi Cho. The Lord put a \nsingle message in his heart and mouth: \"I love you, I love you, I \nlove you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's something: God does not look on the outward appearances. He \nlooks at the heart. And sometimes, he calls us to a work we do not \nwant to do in order to reveal our heartto reveal what we really \nbelieve, our deepest yearnings. How powerful, anyhow, is the blood of \nChrist, Reverend Cho? How far does the gospel of peace, the ministry \nof reconciliation, reach? Can it heal hatred between Koreans and \nJapanese? Can it make a Jew love a Ninevite? Can it make you be \nreconciled towell, you know who? \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe that's the problem. As it turns out, Jonah is not afraid God is \ntoo hard. His suspicion, actually, runs in exactly the opposite \ndirection: God is too soft. \"O Lord, is this not what I said when I \nwas still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee. I knew that \nyou are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding \nin love, a God who relents from sending calamity\" (4:2, NIV). What \nuse is it denouncing murderous Ninevites if they simply can repent \nand God will show them mercy? What kind of fool, run-amok God would \ndo such a thing? He's neither tame enough nor tough enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe portrait of God that emerges from the story of Jonah is a God \nboth too hard and too soft: too hard on us and too soft on our \nenemies. He's stern toward his children and indulgent to ward \nstrangers. He scolds all the wrong people, pampers all the wrong \npeople. He gives fatted calves to prodigals and not so much as a goat \nto his dutiful sons.  \u0014\n\u0014\nYou've been teaching Sunday school for 12 years without a break. The \nonly time anyone noticed was when you were sick one Sunday and forgot \nto phone for a replacement. The Sunday-school supervisor, curt and \ncold, said she thought you were thoughtful enough to know better than \nthat. The next Sunday, everyone's astir: a real-estate broker, \nnotorious for his swindling, just converted and baptized, shared a \nmoving testimony. The church got a cake for him and em braced him \nlike a son. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's hard to follow a God who does those kind of things. It's hard to \nobey a God like that. \u0014\n\u0014\nObey. I used to think Jonah's central lessonits moral, the nugget to \nmine for sermons or Sunday schoolwas how important it is to obey \nGod. After all, disobedience is costly for Jonah: a sea storm, a \nnear-drowning, a fish belly. And, in the end, the same unbending \ncommand: Go! \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I don't think that's the story's main thrust. For one thing, God \nuses Jonah's disobedience rather effectively. The reluctant prophet \nbecomes the accidental evangelist. He boards ship with pagan sailors \nto Tarshish. Jonah's not interested in these men. He's avoiding not \njust God, but everyone. He goes down into the hold of the boat to \nsleep. But God sends a storm. The sailorsdecent mentry everything \nto save the boat from going down. Then, when all that fails, they \nwake Jonah up and ask him to pray. That doesn't work either. They \ncast lots to find out who's causing the trouble, andwouldn't you \nknow?the lot falls on Jonah. \"Who are you?\" they ask. \"What do you \ndo? Where do you come from?\" (Often pagans have to force us to \nidentify ourselves.) Jonah answers, with what sounds like staggering \nsmugness, \"I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, \nwho made the sea and the land\" (1:9). \u0014\n\u0014\nThey keep trying, with all strength, courage, ingenuity, to save the \nship, themselves, Jonah, but nothing doing. So, at Jonah's bidding, \nthey toss him overboard. Earlier, these men prayed earnestly to their \nown gods (1:5). But in our last glimpse of them, we see their boat, \ntheir faces, blur and darken as the water surges up above Jonah's \nsinking body. They fear and make sacrifices and vows to Jonah's God, \nthe Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land. God uses \nJonah's disobedience, openly confessed (1:10), as an opportunity to \nreveal himself to pagan sailors. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod is not interested in our obedience so much for his sake. He can \njust as well use our disobedience. Obedience is for our own good. But \nin the end, obedience by itself is not much good. Jonah, under \ncompulsion, finally does the will of God: trudges off to Nineveh, \npreaches as he's told. He is obedient. But he's more miserable in his \nobedience than in his disobedience. In the ocean's depths, in the \nfish's belly, in his disobedience, Jonah feared death and prayed for \ndeliverance (2:7). But under the wilted vine, with Nineveh saved, in \nhis obedience, Jonah longs for death, and prays for God to deal it \nswiftly and unflinchingly (4:3). \"Trust and obey, for there's no \nother way, to be happy in Jesus than to trust and obey.\" Jonah didn't \nwrite that song. Jonah doesn't sing that song. Jonah hates that song. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs God solely, or mostly, interested in our obedience? No. There is \nsomething deeper down than that. Obedience, actually, can harden us \nto God more than disobedience can. If you doubt it, compare the older \nson with the younger one in the parable of the prodigal; compare the \nPharisees and religious rulers with the tax collectors and \nprostitutes in the stories about Jesus. Or just look at Jonah. \nObedience by itself can make our heart withered and bitter and barren \nas a husk. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is God mostly interested in? Strangely, anti-climactically, it \nhas to do with concerns: the objects, the depth, the rightness of, \nthe right to, our concernsand his. No sign will be given to you \nexcept the sign of Jonah. But is this sign not also God's \nextravagant, unbroken concern for both the evil and the complacent, \nfor Ninevites as well as Jonahs, for prostitutes as well as \nPharisees, for my enemy as well as for me? \u0014\n\u0014\nI'm just old enough to remember that at one time, not long ago \nreally, the central task for the faithful preacher of Jonah was to \nconvince hard-bitten, science-bred parishioners that there are fish \nin the sea big enough to swallow a man whole, and to explicate just \nexactly how a man could survive intact three days inside such a fish. \nThe main hermeneutic for the book was not theology, but \nichthyologythe scientific study of fish. So now let me confess my \nsecret heresy: the fish question is beside the point. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe real puzzle of Jonahits perpetual source of wonder and doubtis \nthis: why is God so deeply concerned about, not just Nineveh, but \nthis man Jonah? This sulking, griping, stingy, self-absorbed little \nmanwhy him? Why would God pursue him to the ends of the earth, to \nthe bottom of the sea, to the outskirts of Nineveh? \u0014\n\u0014\nI bought a rhododendron bush two summers ago. I paid $8.99a cut \nrate, because it was well past planting season, and the plant's \nleaves had a blight, a charred brittleness at their edges. But the \nearth around here is endlessly fertile, and I figured it would do \nfine. I was right. I planted the rhododendron at the front of my \nyard, and it flourished. The leaves turned a waxy dark green, and the \nnext spring it flamed bright with pink-red flowers. A burning bush. \u0014\n\u0014\nI live in a cul-de-sac that's perfect for playing road hockey: flat, \nwide, little traffic. Teenagers from all over the place descend on \nthe street on summer evenings and have noisy, tussling hockey games. \nOne morning, after the neighborhood teens had been playing road \nhockey the evening before, I went out to water my rhododendron. I \nlooked down and saw that a large branch from the bush had been broken \noff, leaving be hind ragged edges. I picked up the branch, and a wave \nof bitterness and anger came over me. Should I phone the city, I \nwondered, and have hockey banned on my street? Should I go out when \nthose teenagers return this evening, and scold and threaten them? \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mark,\" the Lord seemed to say to me, \"do you have any right to be \nangry?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Lord said, \"That's just a cut-rate bush that you neither made \nnor tended. You merely planted it, and it grew. But these boys are my \ncreation, made in my image. Should I not be concerned about them?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShould God not be concerned about Nineveh, or New York, or Duncan, \nBritish Columbia? \u0014\n\u0014\nShould he not be concerned about teenagers playing road hockey, \nbreaking bushes? \u0014\n\u0014\nShould he not be concerned about smug, sullen prophets? \u0014\n\u0014\nShould he not be concerned about middle-class, middle-aged pastors \nwho stew over broken rhododendrons? \u0014\n\u0014\nShould he, plain and simple, just not be concerned? \u0014\n\u0014\nMore and more, I see my whole view of God depends on how I answer that\u0014\n. \u0014\nNo sign will be given to you except that of the prophet Jonah. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark Buchanan is pastor of the New Life Community Baptist Church, \nDuncan, British Columbia.\u0014",

    "title": "RUTHLESSLY ELIMINATE HURRY",
    "words": "RUTHLESSLY ELIMINATE HURRY\u0014\n   by John Ortberg, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   Not long after moving to Chicago, I called a wise friend to\u0014\n   ask for some spiritual direction. I described the pace of life\u0014\n   in my current ministry. The church where I serve tends to move\u0014\n   at a fast clip. I also told him about our rhythms of family\u0014\n   life: we are in the van-driving, soccer-league, piano-lesson,\u0014\n   school-orientation-night years. I told him about the present\u0014\n   condition of my heart, as best I could discern it. What did I\u0014\n   need to do, I asked him, to be spiritually healthy?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Long pause.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life,\" he said\u0014\n   at last.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Another long pause.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Okay, I've written that one down,\" I told him, a little\u0014\n   impatiently. \"That's a good one. Now what else is there?\" I\u0014\n   had many things to do, and this was a long-distance call, so I\u0014\n   was anxious to cram as many units of spiritual wisdom into the\u0014\n   least amount of time possible.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Another long pause.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"There is nothing else,\" he said. \"You must ruthlessly\u0014\n   eliminate hurry from your life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   I've concluded that my life and the well-being of the people I\u0014\n   serve depends on following his prescription, for hurry is the\u0014\n   great enemy of spiritual life in our day. Hurry destroys\u0014\n   souls. As Carl Jung wrote, \"Hurry is not of the devil; hurry\u0014\n   is the devil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   For most of us, the great danger is not that we will renounce\u0014\n   our faith. It is that we will become so distracted and rushed\u0014\n   and preoccupied that we will settle for a mediocre version of\u0014\n   it. We will just skim our lives instead of actually living\u0014\n   them.\u0014\n\u0014\n   One of the great illusions of our day is that hurrying will\u0014\n   buy us more time. I pulled into a service station recently\u0014\n   where the advertising slogan read, \"We help you move faster.\"\u0014\n   But what if my primary need is not moving faster?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Time magazine noted that back in the 1960s, expert testimony\u0014\n   was given to a sub-committee of the Senate on time management.\u0014\n   The gist was that due to advances in technology, within 20\u0014\n   years or so people would have to cut back radically on how\u0014\n   many hours a week they worked (or how many weeks a year they\u0014\n   worked), or they'd have to start retiring sooner. The great\u0014\n   challenge, they said, would be figuring out what to do with\u0014\n   all the excess time.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Yet 30 years later, not many of us would say this is our\u0014\n   primary time challenge. In fact, quite the reverse. Robert\u0014\n   Banks, author of All the Business of Life, notes that while\u0014\n   our society is rich in things, we are extremely poor in time.\u0014\n   In fact, never before in human history has a society been so\u0014\n   things-rich and so time-poor.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Our world has become the world of the Red Queen in Alice in\u0014\n   Wonderland: \"Now here, you see, it takes all the running you\u0014\n   can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere\u0014\n   else, you must run at least twice as fast as that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Meyer Friedman (who with Diane Ulmer wrote Treating Type A\u0014\n   Behavior -- and Your Heart) defines hurry sickness as \"above\u0014\n   all, a continuous struggle and unremitting attempt to\u0014\n   accomplish or achieve more and more things or participate in\u0014\n   more and more events in less and less time, frequently in the\u0014\n   face of opposition, real or imagined, from other persons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Though our age intensifies \"hurry sickness,\" it's not a new\u0014\n   problem; people in ministry have been subject to it at least\u0014\n   since the days of Jesus. During one hectic season of ministry,\u0014\n   Mark notes of the disciples, \"For many were coming and going,\u0014\n   and they had no leisure even to eat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Far too many people involved in ministry think of this as a\u0014\n   life verse, as if God will reward the hectic one day with,\u0014\n   \"What a life you had! Many were coming and going, and you had\u0014\n   no leisure even to eat. Well done!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Not quite. Jesus was aware of this problem, and he constantly\u0014\n   withdrew from crowds and activities. He taught the same to his\u0014\n   followers. In one instance, when they returned from a busy\u0014\n   time of ministry, filled with adrenaline, he told them, \"Come\u0014\n   away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   If you want to follow someone, you can't go faster than the\u0014\n   one who is leading; following Jesus cannot be done at a\u0014\n   sprint. Jesus was often busy but he was never hurried. Being\u0014\n   busy is an outer condition; being hurried is a sickness of the\u0014\n   soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Jesus never went about the busyness of his ministry in a way\u0014\n   that severed the life-giving connection between himself and\u0014\n   his Father.\u0014\n\u0014\n   He never did it in a way that interfered with his ability to\u0014\n   give love when that was what was called for. He observed a\u0014\n   regular rhythm of withdrawal from activity, for solitude and\u0014\n   prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n   He ruthlessly eliminated hurry from his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \u0014\n   John Ortberg is teaching pastor at Willow Creek Community\u0014\n   Church in South Barrington, Illinois.\u0014",

    "words": "Leadership Journal, Spring 2002\u0014\n\u0014\nRubbing Out the Singles Pastor\u0014\nWhy we do ministry mob-style.\u0014\nby Chris Seay\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it seems ironic, but Tony Soprano has become a mentor to me, \nteaching me about the church and the kind of pastor I want to become.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no evidence of redemption in his life. His marriage is \nfragile at best, and he is always about an episode away from a \ncomplete breakdown. But I love the man. That's why I keep coming back \nfor more, me and the millions who watch \"The Sopranos,\" HBO's popular \nseries about a New Jersey Mafia family. As I've journeyed with this \nfictional mob boss, here's what I've learned:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIntegrate the family\u0014\nTony knows that any family member in isolation is vulnerable; it's \nsuicide. You don't advance in the business by working on your own. \nLearning comes from your own experience and from people further down \nthe road than you. Tony Soprano has his nephew Christopher, an \nassociate, ride with Paulie, a captain, to learn the ropes of the \nfamily business. And in this business, Tony says, \"we're soldiers.\" A \nsoldier should learn from the captain, and a captain from the \nunder-boss and consigliere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same is true at Tony's home; all family members sit down to share \ndinner together. Three generations of Sopranos break bread and share \nlife on a daily basis. This is a sacred time and tardiness is not \nacceptable. There would never be a children's table in the Soprano \nhousehold. It is a time when all business is put aside to be together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis simple truth has been lost in the church, and it may be our \ngreatest weakness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe single young people who fill (or used to fill) our communities \nlive in fear and ignorance when it comes to marital issues. Many come \nfrom broken homes and have no concept of a healthy family.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what is the church's response to these people? We separate them \nout to lead one another like blind guides. Who will teach them how to \ndeal with the difficulties that come with love relationships? The \nSingles Pastor?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese people (along with everyone else) should have a seat at the \nfamily table. Life is lived with the whole family, not at the kid's \ntable.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tTreat every member with respect\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Ecclesia, we do not separate people according to marital status. \nWhen people do eventually marry, they have spent an enormous amount \nof time with families in the church body, and family life is \nfamiliar. The difficulties of the husband-wife relationship have been \nexamined closely, and redemption has been seen and experienced.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you currently do 20 funerals for every wedding and the thought of \nyour church dying under its current leaders rings as a reality in \nyour head, then by all means do not throw your money away by hiring a \npastor for all the single people that you have (or want to have) in \nyour fellowship. This is an ineffective plan for church growth. I can \npromise that bad things will happen if you do. You will corrupt the \nfew healthy non-married people left in your church, or you will scare \nthem away.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither they will acquiesce: \"I love having a singles pastor. It's \nlike offering a social coordinator on a cruise ship. I think the \nchurch should hire people to meet all my felt needs for the rest of \nmy life.\" This is disaster! We have created consumers for all our \nprograms; and if we ever fail to deliver, the consumer will be off to \nlook for a better product.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr they will be disgusted: \"The only holy and sacred place in my life \nhas turned into a meat market, and the oddballs are coming from \nchurches all over town to try to pick me up.\" And that's the \nbest-case scenario. Church kids are the only people drawn to a \nsingles program. Believe me, they won't come to serve, tithe, and be \na part of the body. They are just there to get a date.\u0014\n\u0014\nHiring a singles pastor in 2002 is like wearing bell-bottoms in the \n'80's, Izod shirts in the '90's, or joining the Mariah Carey fan club \nin the new millennium. The last thing non-married people need is a \npastor specialist reminding them that they're single. It would make \nmore sense to hire one pastor for engineers and another for \nartistsor for smokers and non-smokers, lovers of Radiohead and \nlovers of Neil Diamondthan to hire one pastor for marrieds and \nanother for pre-marrieds.\u0014\n\u0014\nOkay, so you already have a singles pastor. Or worse (my apologies), \nyou are a singles pastor. What do you do? Make some changes, and \nstart with the title. Almost anything would be better. Develop \nopportunities for the whole body. Begin to shepherd the entire \nchurch. You have gifts that should be shared in other areas as \nopportunities grow.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we begin age-segregating our family, all natural discipleship is \nminimized (if not eliminated). The younger and unmarried should be \nright alongside mom and dad at the table of faith, engaging the \nmysteries of the gospel as a family.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWatch your mouth\u0014\n\u0014\nOkay, so Tony tends to throw out a lot of four-letter words. He \nstrings sentences together that would make Andrew Dice Clay blush. \nIt's what you would expect from the leader of an infamous crime \nfamily and owner of the Bada-Bing, a strip-club and mob hangout. \nLanguage is a tool Tony uses to evoke a desired response.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout language, the church has to ask some hard questions about the \nwords we use. We may find that they do not result in our desired \nresponse.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear a large apartment mega-complex that houses thousands of young \nprofessionals in Dallas's lower Greenville is a graying traditional \nchurch. This historic church is in the hotbed of urban activity, but \nthere is literally no one under 40 in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nI recommended the church begin a new service with the autonomy of a \nchurch plant. To publicize the new service, we contacted the \napartment mega-plex about advertising in a publicity packet they \ndistribute monthly. The flyers are generally for pizza delivery, hair \nsalons, and the like. The only restriction included with this paid \nservice is that we not use a word often seen as offensive to many \nresidentssingle.\u0014\n\u0014\n             Don't use the \"s\" word.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt rings with tones of solo, isolated, or alone. Targeting people \nwithout spouses is considered offensive, and they wanted it to be \nclear that non-married people are not missing something. In trendy \nlower Greenville, \"single\" is an offensive word, yet it is used \nfrequently in most churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor God's sake, take it out of your dictionary! Emerging generations \nsee marriage as an option: \"If I choose to marry, it will likely be \nlater in life. Marital status is no longer the primary lens used to \ndefine who I am.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, it is the worst one. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Seay is founding pastor of Ecclesia, a postmodern church in \nHouston, Texas.\u0014",

Is it any \nwonder our kids are\u0014\n                                      confused about truth? Why \nshouldn't they lie? It\u0014\n                                      seems as though everyone else \ndoes!\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      A nationwide teen character \nstudy released by\u0014\n                                      the nonprofit Joseph & Edna \nJosephson\u0014\n                                      Institute of Ethics found 7 in \n10 students\u0014\n                      surveyed admitted to cheating on a test at \nleast once in the past\u0014\n                      year, and nearly half said they'd done so more \nthan once. Overall the\u0014\n                      Report Card on the Ethics of American Youth \ndisclosed that 92\u0014\n                      percent of the 8,600 students surveyed lied to \ntheir parents. In\u0014\n                      addition, 78 percent said they'd lied to a \nteacher, and more than 1 in\u0014\n                      4 said they'd probably lie to get a job.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Our culture's standard for integrity seems to \nbe: It doesn't matter if\u0014\n                      you shade the truth as long as no one gets hurt \nand you don't get\u0014\n                      caught. God's standard is: Do what's right even \nwhen no one is\u0014\n                      looking and no one will find out. What can we \ndo to raise kids with\u0014\n                      God's standard for integrity? Here are six \nsuggestions:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Model Honesty\u0014\n                      I'm often tempted to exaggerate. But in \nstriving to raise honest kids,\u0014\n                      I've had to face my weakness. I've asked my \nchildren to tell me if I'm\u0014\n                      exaggerating. On more than one occasion, they \nhave! It's so easy to\u0014\n                      exaggerate or use \"white lies\" for \nconvenience's sake, such as\u0014\n                      requesting your child tell a telephone caller \nyou're not home when you\u0014\n                      are. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's the trend in your behavior? Is it toward \nabsolute honesty or\u0014\n                      deception? God's Word says, \"Whoever can be \ntrusted with very little\u0014\n                      can also be trusted with much, and whoever is \ndishonest with very\u0014\n                      little will also be dishonest with much\" (Luke \n16:10). Kids see adult\u0014\n                      role models as examples of what it takes to get \nahead in the real\u0014\n                      world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Don't Blame Others\u0014\n                      One day when I was potty training our twins, I \nnoticed Libby had a\u0014\n                      strange look on her face and was walking \nawkwardly. \"Libby,\" I\u0014\n                      asked, \"did you wet your pants?\" \"No, Mommy,\" \nshe replied. \"Susy\u0014\n                      did it!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I burst out laughing, but her response is a \ntypical refrain in a\u0014\n                      house-hold with young children. When something \ngoes wrong, our\u0014\n                      natural instinct is to blame othersour boss, \nour parents, our\u0014\n                      circumstances, our friends. Teach your child \nthat in the final analysis,\u0014\n                      she is responsible for her own behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Discipline Lying\u0014\n                      Talk with your children about complete honesty. \nMake sure they\u0014\n                      understand lying means big punishment. We've \nalways prayed that if\u0014\n                      our kids do anything wrong, they'll get caught. \nOften they are! If your\u0014\n                      child's caught in a lie, don't bail him out. \nWalk with him in his\u0014\n                      punishment, but let him suffer the consequences \nof his actions. Take\u0014\n                      time to talk about the importance of honesty. \nGetting caught can be a\u0014\n                      blessing, although your child won't see that at \nthe moment!\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Praise Integrity\u0014\n                      Tell your kids the most important thing they \ncan do is to tell the truth.\u0014\n                      Then, when they do, praise them for it. Remind \nthem that no one can\u0014\n                      take away their integrity. You may lose your \nhealth, money,\u0014\n                      possessions, and friends, but you always can \nremain honest, and\u0014\n                      this gives you self-respect.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Follow the Right Standard\u0014\n                      \"Students seem to decide for themselves what \nconstitutes cheating.

Yet the apostle Paul says, \"Each of \nyou must put off\u0014\n                      falsehood and speak truthfully\" (Ephesians \n4:25). We must look to\u0014\n                      God's Word as our standard, not to other people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Keep Growing\u0014\n                      I want to be a person of integrity; that means \nI seek to be honest and\u0014\n                      consistent in all my attitudes and actions. But \nwhat happens when I\u0014\n                      fail? How can I then expect my children to live \nup to my\u0014\n                      standardsisn't that hypocritical? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I've learned hypocrisy isn't caused by high \nstandards, but by parents\u0014\n                      who wink at the standards while insisting their \nchildren adhere to\u0014\n                      them. Integrity means maintaining high \nstandards while\u0014\n                      acknowledging failure and seeking to grow.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Raising honest kids begins in the home, and it \nbegins in my life and\u0014\n                      in yours. So ask God, \"Show me where I'm not \nbeing completely\u0014\n                      truthful, and give me the strength to change.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Susan Alexander Yates is the author of numerous \nbooks, including And Then I\u0014\n                      Had Teenagers (Baker Book House).\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Moms Speak Out!\u0014\n                       What you had to say about teaching your child \nto be honest:\u0014\n\u0014\n                       I used yarn to explain to my 3rd-grade class \nShakespeare's quote,\u0014\n                       \"What a tangled web we weave when first we \npractice to deceive.\"\u0014\n                       First, the class made up a story; we called \nthat the truth.

That event occurred one year ago on the \nmorning\u0014\nof Sept 11th. Consider for a moment what was set in motion by the \nterrorist\u0014\nattacks of that day:\u0014\n\u0014\nOur nation's capital was attacked.\u0014\nOver 3000 people lost their lives.\u0014\nThe Manhattan skyline was irrevocably changed.\u0014\nThe financial trade center for 150 nations was completely destroyed.\u0014\nThe world's economy was greatly tested.\u0014\nWe waged a war against the Taliban in Afghanistan.\u0014\nBut, a long-standing almost invisible war will be fought for years to \ncome\u0014\naround the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the big picture and it says nothing of the tens of thousands of\u0014\npeople here and abroad whose lives were changed. Try to calculate the \nhuman\u0014\ntoll emotionally and spiritually and you cannot. Only God can weigh \nsuch\u0014\nmatters. But we try in feeble ways to understand. Events like these \nraise\u0014\nfundamental questions. Why is there so much evil in the world? Why do\u0014\ninnocent people suffer? Where is God when tragedy strikes?\u0014\n\u0014\nI am struck by how universal these questions are. They are as old as \nJob and\u0014\nare asked by the wisest people among us. Take a look at our text this\u0014\nmorning. In Luke 13 two events have been the talk of the town. \nApparently, a\u0014\ntower in the city of Siloam collapsed killing 18 people. The second \nevent,\u0014\nPilate publicly executed some Jews visiting Jerusalem. This was done \ninside\u0014\nthe temple as they worshiped and so had a rather sensational quality \nto it.\u0014\nWith these two events in mind the disciples approach Jesus and ask \nhim an\u0014\nage-old question: Why did this happen?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what do we do when towers fall and people perish? I would like to \noffer\u0014\nthe following as a road map:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. First we must mourn the loss.\u0014\n2. Second we must acknowledge the pain.\u0014\n3. Third we must look to the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following illustrations are information that we gathered last year\u0014\nduring the week of 9-11. We thought sending out this collection was \nthe best\u0014\nway to represent the anniversary. Doubtless there will be many \napproaches\u0014\ntaken on Sunday the 8th and Wednesday the 11th.

Today, our fellow citizens, our way of \nlife,\u0014\nour very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and \ndeadly\u0014\nterrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes, or in their offices;\u0014\nsecretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers; \nmoms and\u0014\ndads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended \nby evil,\u0014\ndespicable acts of terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge\u0014\nstructures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible \nsadness, and\u0014\na quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to\u0014\nfrighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed; our\u0014\ncountry is strong.\u0014\n\u0014\nA great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist \nattacks\u0014\ncan shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot \ntouch\u0014\nthe foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they \ncannot dent\u0014\nthe steel of American resolve.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for\u0014\nfreedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light \nfrom\u0014\nshining.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature. And we \nresponded\u0014\nwith the best of America -- with the daring of our rescue workers, \nwith the\u0014\ncaring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in \nany\u0014\nway they could.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's\u0014\nemergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's \nprepared. Our\u0014\nemergency teams are working in New York City and Washington, D.C. to \nhelp\u0014\nwith local rescue efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and \nto\u0014\ntake every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the \nworld\u0014\nfrom further attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal\u0014\nagencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening \nfor\u0014\nessential personnel tonight, and will be open for business tomorrow. \nOur\u0014\nfinancial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will \nbe open\u0014\nfor business, as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts. I've\u0014\ndirected the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement\u0014\ncommunities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. \nWe will\u0014\nmake no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts \nand\u0014\nthose who harbor them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me \nin\u0014\nstrongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American \npeople, I\u0014\nthank the many world leaders who have called to offer their \ncondolences and\u0014\nassistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace \nand\u0014\nsecurity in the world, and we stand together to win the war against\u0014\nterrorism. Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, \nfor the\u0014\nchildren whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of \nsafety and\u0014\nsecurity has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a \npower\u0014\ngreater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23: \"Even \nthough I\u0014\nwalk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for \nYou are\u0014\nwith me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our\u0014\nresolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, \nand we\u0014\nwill do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day. Yet, we go\u0014\nforward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThank you. Good night, and God bless America.\u0014\n________________\u0014\n\u0014\nInternational Response:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There have been the most terrible, shocking events taking place in \nthe\u0014\nUnited States of America within the last couple of hours.

Most prominent are the 110-story\u0014\nrectangular twin towers, one rising to 1,362 ft (415 m) and the other \nto\u0014\n1,368 ft (417 m). Designed by Minoru Yamasaki and Emery Roth, the \ntowers and\u0014\nconcourse portion of the center were completed in 1973 at a cost of \n$750\u0014\nmillion, the project broke ground in 1966. A massive terrorist \ncar-bomb\u0014\nexplosion damaged portions of the complex in 1993, killing six people \nand\u0014\ncausing more than $300 million in damages. In 1995, Sheik Omar Abdel \nRahman\u0014\nand nine other militant Muslims (Sudanese, Egyptian, American, and \nJordanian\u0014\ncitizens) were convicted of conspiracy and other charges related to \nthe\u0014\nbombing.

Similarly, 87% of all Americans -- including 80% of those \nover the\u0014\nage of 50 -- see the attacks as the most tragic news event in their\u0014\nlifetimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked what the United States should do about the attacks, 71% of\u0014\nAmericans say the government should conduct military strikes only \nagainst\u0014\nthe terrorist organizations responsible for the attacks, even if it \ntakes\u0014\nmonths to clearly identify who they are. Just 21% want quicker action \n-- to\u0014\nconduct military strikes against known terrorist organizations, even \nif it\u0014\nis unclear who caused the attacks on the United States. Just 4% of \nAmericans\u0014\noppose any military retaliation at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix in 10 Americans Worried About Becoming a Victim of Terrorism:\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans are much more worried today about becoming a victim of \nterrorism\u0014\nthan they were after the Oklahoma City bombing six years ago. The \ncurrent\u0014\npoll shows 60% of Americans saying they are either \"very\" or \n\"somewhat\"\u0014\nworried that they or someone in their family will become a victim, \ncompared\u0014\nwith 42% who expressed that view in April 1995, shortly after the \nOklahoma\u0014\nCity bombing. Last year, at the fifth anniversary of that bombing, \nonly 24%\u0014\nsaid they were worried.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reason for the increased worry may be that a majority of \nAmericans, 55%,\u0014\nsee Tuesday's attacks as the beginning of a sustained terrorist \ncampaign\u0014\n\"that will continue for several weeks.\" The rest of Americans either\u0014\ndisagree with that view (29%), or say they are unsure (16%).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis worry apparently influences how Americans might behave in the \nfuture.\u0014\nHalf of the public (49%) predicts that, as a consequence of the \nterrorist\u0014\nattacks, Americans will permanently change the way they live, while \n45%\u0014\ndisagree. On a personal level, 36% of Americans admit that they will \nchange\u0014\nsome aspect of their personal lives or activities to avoid being a \nvictim of\u0014\nterrorism, but 61% say they will not make any changes. Nevertheless, \nwhen\u0014\nasked about their fear of flying, 48% of Americans admitted that the\u0014\nterrorist attacks make them less willing to fly on airplanes.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublic Confident in Government Response:\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost nine in 10 Americans, 88%, say the government is either very \nlikely\u0014\n(52%) or somewhat likely (36%) to identify and punish the people \nresponsible\u0014\nfor the attacks. A large majority of Americans are also confident in\u0014\nPresident Bush's ability to handle the situation -- 45% are very \nconfident,\u0014\nand another 33% are somewhat confident.\u0014\n__________________\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington Post-ABC Poll (Tuesday, September 11, 2001; 11:24 PM ):\u0014\n\u0014\nNine in 10  94 percent  support taking military action against the \ngroups\u0014\nor nations responsible for the attacks.

    "words": "Religious practice in America unchanged by 9/11, Barna says\u0014\nBy ABP staff \u0014\n\u0014\nVENTURA, Calif. (ABP)  Last years terrorist attacks had no lasting \nimpact on Americas religious practices, according to pollster George \nBarna.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout half of Americans surveyed by the Barna Research Group said \ntheir faith was an important resource for helping them deal with \nevents of Sept. 11. One fourth of all adults (25 percent) said it was \nthe single most important resource they have relied on, and 23 \npercent said their faith was one of several important resources \nthat helped them deal with the tragedy.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch attendance spiked for several weeks after Sept. 11, but it was \na short-lived revival. By November, attendance levels were no \ndifferent than before the attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarna found little or no change in the last year over the percentage \nof Americans who read their Bible regularly (41 percent), attend \nchurch (43 percent) or pray (83 percent). The percentage of \nunchurched Americans remained constant at 33 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome theorized that shock from the attacks might serve as a spiritual \nwake-up call for Americans, leading to a religious revival. But Barna \nsaid he could find no statistically significant change in religious \nbelief or practice in the past 12 months.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust 12 percent of Americans said the terrorist attacks had any \nimpact on their religious faith. Among born-again Christians, the \npercentage is 18 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was among those who fully expected to see an intense spiritual \nreaction to the terrorist attacks, said Barna, an evangelical \nChristian. The fact that we saw no lasting impact from the most \nsignificant act of war against our country on our own soil says \nsomething about the spiritual complacency of the American public.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarna said the increased worship attendance after 9/11 is explained \nby a rallying of church members who attend infrequently, rather than \nan influx of new believers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we witnessed was the people who attend once every month or two \nsuddenly returning on a consistent basis for a month or two before \nfalling back into their regular pattern of irregular attendance, he \nsaid. It appears that very few people radically changed their \npersonal agenda and added church involvement to their schedule when \npreviously there had been no such activity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarna said barely half of the nations churches acknowledged or \naddressed the attacks in any way during the last 12 months. Only one \nin four adults attending a Christian church (23 percent) said their \nchurch engaged in prayer specific to the attacks, 16 percent said \ntheir churches provided sermons or other teaching related to the \nattacks, and 10 percent said their church had provided special \nservices.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet six out of 10 (58 percent) said their religious center has done \nan excellent or good job in addressing these matters.\u0014",

    "title": "ROLLIN ARMOUR AND HIS NEW BOOK ON ISLAM",
    "words": "A BSB INTERVIEW WITH ROLLIN ARMOUR ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK\u0014\n\u0014\nNote: Rollin Armour, a graduate of Baylor University, Southern \nSeminary, and Harvard Divinity School, is now retired from a long and \nvery influential career as a professor of religion. He taught at \nStetson, Auburn, and, most recently, at Mercer. He won the Brewer \nPrize in church history for his book on the Anabaptist view of \nbaptism. For the last several years, he has vigorously pursued \nresearch in the area of Muslim-Christian relations. This research \nresulted in the publication of his book in 2002 by Orbis Press. It is \na most readable book, published at a most opportune and relevant \ntime. We commend this intriguing book by a superior Baptist scholar \nto our readers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: Dr. Armour, you have entitled your book Islam, Christianity, and \nthe West: A Troubled History. Tell us in a few sentences the theme of \nyour book.\u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: The book describes the history of the West's responses to \nIslam in two respects: the intellectual responses in written \nmaterial, and the political-military responses in the open field of \nhistory. In the early centuries these opinions and actions came from \nChristian writers and leaders.\u0014\nIn later centuries, after the West became more secularized, the \nresponses were more Western than Christian. As the title suggests, \nthe relationship between the West and Islam has been one of conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: Yes. I begin with the story of Muhammad, an overview of the \nteachings and practices of Islam, and a description of early Islamic \nhistory. In addition I describe some of the actions of the Islamic \nworld toward the West in the subsequent centuries, including the \npresent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: Islam is a major topic today in both religion and politics. But \nwhen you began your research several years ago that was not true. \nTell us how you came to choose this subject for a book.\u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: My academic area is church history, but all along I have also \ntaught courses in world religions. I guess I chose this specific \ntopic for several reasons. \u0014\nFirst, it has seemed to me that most church historians have neglected \nthe interaction of Christianity with other religions.\u0014\nSecond, save for Judaism, no religion has had more contact with \nChristianity than Islam.\u0014\nThird, the West has long had a bias against Muslims, particularly \nArabs. I believe it was Annemarie Schimmel, an Islamics scholar, who \nsaid that Westerners inherit in their genes an antipathy toward \nIslam. I thought that problem would be worthy of investigation.\u0014\nFourth, even a few years ago, our relation to Muslims was becoming \nincreasingly important, so I thought this would be a good time to \nundertake the project.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: Did you consider Schimmel correct in her view? Have Westerners \nbeen biased toward Islam?\u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: The answer is yes. The history is embarrassingly replete with \ndistortions, misrepresentations, and power moves from the West that \ncame from a continuing hostility toward the Islamic and Arab world. \nOnly rarely does one see a break in this pattern. The Islamic world \nhas probably not been any better, by the way, but my book focuses on \nthe Western side of the story, not the Islamic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: How do you account for this bias on the part of the West? \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: Perhaps the first answer is that humans generally look \naskance at \"others\" and feel superior, tending to see one's own \nmotives as pure, the motives of others as suspect. \u0014\nThen there is the traditional Christian claim of an absolute \nrevelation in the Christian message that leaves everyone outside \nunder condemnation.\u0014\nFinally, the two religions formed entire civilizations that have \nbordered each other and competed over a millennium for land and \npower. Given those factors, one can expect prejudice and \nmisunderstanding. Muslims have their own reasons for prejudice, of \ncourse, since Islam is held to be an improvement on Judaism and \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: Give us a thumbnail sketch of this history of antipathy. \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: The conflict began in the early years of Islam with the \nMuslim conquest of Christian territory in North Africa, Spain, and \nSyria-Palestine. Christians responded a few centuries later with the \nCrusades, recapturing much of Palestine, but then, after about two \nhundred years, losing it again.\u0014\nIn the fifteenth century Muslim Turks captured the great Christian \ncity of Constantinople and then moved on up into eastern Europe.\u0014\nAnd in the modern period European colonialism took over almost the \nentire Islamic world. In this rather see-saw fashion, the two \ncivilizations have struggled against each other for almost \nfourteen-hundred years. Because Christians wrote about Islam in the \nmidst of these conflicts, their views were often shaped by the \nconflict. \u0014\nFinally, many Muslims interpret the modern state of Israel as a \ncontinuing aspect of Western colonialism, in that Israel is something \nof a Western outpost in the middle of Arab land.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: What have you learned from your research that relates to our \npresent situation? \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: Tragically, the relationship has entered a new and violent \nstage. In the development of Islamic sponsored terrorism, we are \nseeing the harsh and destructive side of Islam that covers up the \nresponsible and creative side that has characterized much of Islamic \nhistory.\u0014\nBut as I explain in the book, the West in both its Christian and \nsecular forms has its own history of harshness and destruction. We \nsee that in the massacres of Jews in the Middle Ages, a persecution \nthat continued into the last century. In addition, Christians often \ntook harsh measures against Muslims as well. Those people recently \nengaged in Muslim bashing have forgotten that our own history is full \nof such violence. In fact, most historians will argue that over the \ncenturies it was better to be a Christian or Jew in Muslim territory \nthan a Muslim or Jew in Christian territory. Neither side, Christian \nor Muslim, practiced our modern form of religious freedom, but \nprotections for religious minorities were generally better in the \nIslamic world than in Christendom.\u0014\nWhile we have every reason to protest the current violence, we would \ndo well not to charge Islam with being evil, lest our own past be \nbrought up to haunt us. In fact, that may be the principal lesson in \nmy book.\u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: Finally, do you have any thoughts about the future and the \nrelationship between the West and the Islamic world? \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: One cannot predict the future, but it seems clear that a \nresolution to this present conflict will require several things. For \none, Islamic leaders must find a way to bring the present violence \nunder control, and particularly to end the suicide bombings and the \nrelated terrorism. That approach is clearly in conflict with \ntraditional Islam. But at present, as one commentator recently said, \nthe suicide bombers have in the view of many Muslims gained the high \nmoral ground, and that must be taken away from them. We have yet to \nsee significant efforts toward that end, but that is a major \nresponsibility that Islamic leaders must fulfill. \u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: How does the Palestinian-Israeli conflict play into all of this? \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: That is a second major factor for the future. The \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict simply must be resolved if we are to \nfind peace. That dispute is at the bottom of most Islamic protests, \nbut a resolution will require a safe future for both sides. \u0014\n\u0014\nBSB: What other thoughts do you have about the future of this global \nproblem? \u0014\n\u0014\nArmour: We Christians and Westerners must learn more about Islam, not \njust the violent side that we see daily, but the underlying religious \nand moral tradition that characterizes the religion. None of the \nsteps I have suggested will be easy to accomplish, and they certainly \nwill not come quickly, but if responsible leaders can step forward \nand offer constructive measures for solutions, perhaps ways can be \nfound to bring peace. For now, however, the violent conflict seems \nlikely to continue, and probably to increase. Meanwhile, we can hope \nthat on the other side of these troubles, we may find a time when \ncooperation may replace the hostility we see today.\u0014",

    "words": "Ruth Tucker\u0014\nThe professor and author of Walking Away from Faith talks about \ndoubting God.\u0014\nposted 10/29/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nRuth Tucker is associate professor of missiology at Calvin \nTheological Seminary and author of Walking Away from Faith: \nUnraveling the Mystery of Belief and Unbelief (InterVarsity Press).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made you decide to write a book about walking away from faith?\u0014\n\u0014\nThose of us in the Reformed tradition, especially, try to sweep [it] \nunder the carpet because we have our kids, just like those in other \ntraditions, who grow up in the faith, go on into seminary, start \npastoral ministry, and then at some point walk away. We are just \nbewildered by it. We don't want to talk about it. We don't have any \nresponse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow have people reacted to the book?\u0014\n\u0014\nI was speaking to a group of atheists not so long ago and somebody \nraised their hand and said, \"It's the first time I realized you can \nhave it both ways. You can believe and be a Christian, but you can \nalso have doubts and unbelief.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book has confused some people. I was talking to my own church in \nan adult education course. And a man came up to me afterwards and he \nsaid, \"Now, when did you finally move beyond this unbelief?\" I looked \nat him like, \"Have you been listening to me?\" I told him I have never \nto this moment moved beyond it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome must react to your thoughts with relief because they realize \nthey are not the only ones who doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nI get that far more than the other reaction, especially with my \nstudents. I have had so many students come into my office and say, \n\"Oh, that book has just freed me up from struggles that I had. \nBecause here I'm at seminary and wondering, 'Am I the only one?' How \ncan I go on into ministry when I'm struggling? At times do I even \nreally believe the whole ball of wax?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd there is a sense of relief that [the book is] not just me telling \nmy story, but countless of others who have gone through this \ndifficulty, this struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes your own story show an intersection of belief and doubt?\u0014\n\u0014\nI live with belief and unbelief ever present in my life. I struggle. \u0014\n\u0014\nI have often wondered, Is it in the genes? I had two brothers and two \nsisters who walked away from faith. And why is it that I don't? I \nfeel this sense that I couldn't walk away if I wanted to, that God \nhas a grip on me, and yet there is always this sense of wonder and \nlooking into the galaxy and saying, \"Where is this personal God of \nthe Bible?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat doubts do you wrestle with?\u0014\n\u0014\nMy faith is a very strong faith, but it is settled into a faith that \nincludes the paradox, mystery, and tension. So my only struggle is \nnot the Virgin Birth or the Resurrection or the Incarnation or the \nTransfiguration or something like that. It's just the very existence \nof the personal God in the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nI have no trouble believing a God of natural design, designer of the \nuniverse. But I will sometimes think, does this God of the massive \nuniverse know that Ruth Tucker is talking to Dick Staub, and does he \ncare?\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people find comfort in understanding that there is the dimension \nof mystery to our faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nI took a lot of Bible theology courses in my college studies, and I \nlearned all the attributes of God. We could just chalk off \neverything. We had God in a box. We knew who God was precisely. Never \ndo I remember anything about mystery and the unknown and the hidden \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo teach a course on God and theology or on who God is without that \nelement of mystery and hiddenness is cheating the students.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo often people respond to those who are having intellectual doubts, \nand especially scientific philosophical doubts, in a very rational \nway instead of speaking of the mystery and the tension that we have \nin faith, and also the poetry. We think we have to give ten proofs \nfor God, and yet faith is much more aligned with the poetry and prose.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are some of the predominant reasons that people leave this faith?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest hit to a Christian-fundamental belief came in the \nmid-19th century with Charles Darwin and evolution. That was very \ndifficult for Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\nA lot of Christians pulled back and really became reactionary against \nany new scientific finding. That's what we find with young people. \nWhen they go off to college, they'll take science and philosophy \ncourses, and there is no foundation of belief in these courses for \nthe most part. That's what hits the hardest in the late teenage years \nand early 20s.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat else can cause doubts in the minds of believers?\u0014\n\u0014\nYou're reading through the Old Testament and you read about some of \nthe plagues in Exodus. You think, Now, wait a minute. You take that \nvery literally. And so how do you tie that in with your \nrationalistic, scientific worldviews? It is very difficult.\u0014\n\u0014\nLifestyle is also a real issue with people. How do we tie in \nscriptural teachings with who we are as individuals? It's not just \nhomosexuality and extreme feminism and things like that. We all at \none time or anothersometimes almost dailylive as practical \nAtheists. Would we behave the way we are behaving if we believed God, \nthe God of the universe, were present at this very moment? Yet that's \nwhat we teach as Christians. We don't live like it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book begins with a case study of Billy Graham and Chuck \nTempleton. Tell us about the contrast between these two guys.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have Billy Graham growing up in a very strong Christian family \n[and] Charles Templeton growing up in a very dysfunctional family. \nHis father left when he was a child, never to return. His mother was \noften so in debt that they were hiding from the bill collectors \nbehind the sofa. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe came to faith as a teenager and then went on into ministry without \nany real training. Later he did take seminary training and really \nsought God after he'd gone through some serious doubts. And yet he \nstruggled with doubts to the very end of his life and actually walked \naway from faith. His autobiography is entitled A Farewell to God. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe since died. He had Alzheimer's. At the very end he said he would \nlike to believe but he just could not believe in this personal God of \nthe Bible who would allow a starving refugee woman to call out to God \nfor rain when her baby was dying and there was no answer. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think a lot of us struggle with that sort of thing, but we almost \nput a cap on what we can think about or what we can doubt about \nbecause we say if we step beyond that line, does that mean that we \nwon't go over the edge? Chuck Templeton would say it's intellectual \nsuicide if we don't explore the far reaches of doubt and unbelief.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBERING BROWNING WARE; THE GAZE FROM DEATH'S DOOR",
    "words": "Remembering Browning Ware: The Gaze from Death's Door\u0014\n\u0014\nBY Keith Herron\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a long stare into another's eyes, most of us eventually break \naway and look somewhere else. It's too intense, we feel. It's too \nmuch, and feelings of inadequacy disrupt the power of our gaze.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the effect thoughts of our dying have upon us. It's like a \nlong stare into the piercing, unflinching look from another.\u0014\n\u0014\nI meet with all sorts of people in all sorts of places in relation to \ntheir own death. Sometimes the prospective death is their own. They \nstand in the doorway and wonder whether they have the courage to go \non. On other occasions I meet with the surviving loved ones who must \nplan a memorial service. We meet in homes, hospitals and funeral \nhomes and think out loud what must be said and what must be \nremembered.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrowning Ware was pastor of First Baptist Church in Austin for many \nyears. He also had had prostate and bone cancer. He died on Oct. 29. \nNot long before his death, Ware shared in The Austin \nAmerican-Statesman what it meant to him for his body to carry such an \ninvasive disease. Near the shadow of death, he unflinchingly shared \nwhat it was like to stand that close to the doorway separating \nmortality from eternity. In his Aug. 20 column, he wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral of my friends believe that I know a secret. They are \nconvinced that my illness has invested wisdom in me that is rare, \ndifficult to come by, but worthy of exploration. I get the feeling \nthat they want me to report on what is hidden around life's last \nlimiting corner. 'Browning, what do you see beyond the horizon?'\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't observe as much detail as some of my friends would prefer. I \nhave no magic vision of my future beyond death. I trust my traveling \ncompanion, Jesus. He promised to be with me. He is enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, my friends return and press their questions: What do you want \nyour best, your last thoughts to be?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is my answer: I want to be present, as fully present as is \npossible, to what is happening around me and within me. I desire no \nspecial exemptions, but simply the pleasure of answering 'Present' \nwhen my name is called. I want to be glad when these moments are \nfully mine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWare's article stirred up a response from the Austin community of \nreaders eager to know more. He obliged:\u0014\n\u0014\nI recently shared my desire to be fully present to what is happening \nin my life. A teacher friend agreed. He said many of his students, \nhowever, envisioning their own death, want to die suddenly in an \naccident or to die quietly in their sleep. I want to be there when it \nhappens!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of my friends plying me for secret wisdom reminded me of \nthe incident surrounding David Hume's death. The arch skeptic carried \non a life-long exchange with a divine who was convinced that Hume \nwould recant on his deathbed. The minister made frequent trips to \nHume's bedside and had the good fortune to visit Hume on the morning \nhe died. To the minister's chagrin, the old skeptic Hume died \npeacefully and happy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is, I suspect we die pretty much like we lived.\u0014\n\u0014\nWare's unbroken gaze encouraged those of us who wish to be present at \nevery stage of our lives. To be fully alive and aware of God's \npresent mercies is our goal.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeith Herron is senior pastor of Holmeswood Baptist Church in Kansas \nCity, Mo.\u0014",

    "words": "Rock Turning\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago I heard a story that galvanized me. It's a story of \nsome\u0014\nCatholic nuns in Cleveland, Ohio. I don't know the name of their \nOrder, but\u0014\nthey have committed their lives to working in the Catholic schools in\u0014\nCleveland's inner city. Day after day after day, they focus their \nfaith and\u0014\nenergy on the education of inner-city youngsters, youngsters whose \nlives are\u0014\nat risk in so many areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, out of nowhere, a wonderful gift was given to these nuns. \nThe gift\u0014\nwas to pay for the entire Order to go on a vacation. Vans were \nsupplied, and\u0014\nall the necessary money for their trip was contributed anonymously. \nSo, that\u0014\nsummer, the nuns closed their Order house and headed to the vacation \nspot of\u0014\ntheir choice, the Rocky Mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of them had never seen the Rockies, except in their \nimaginations.

She bent down and reached under a sizable rock, and then \nturned the\u0014\nrock upside down. She brushed her hands and turned around to walk \nback up\u0014\nthe trail.

So I turn some rocks over so that this place is different \nbecause I\u0014\npassed here.\"\u0014",

    "words": "In an era of absolute rulers, Tsarina Anna (1693-1740) stood out as \none of the most capricious, unpredictable Romanovs ever to take the \nRussian throne. Despite her impulsiveness and cruelty, however, she \nwas in many ways an effective leader. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Tsar Peter II died without an heir in 1730, a group of noblemen \nchose Anna to succeed him, believing she could be easily manipulated. \nThey stipulated that she could ascend the throne only if she agreed \nnot to remarry (her husband had died of a stroke during their \nhoneymoon) and to leave the government in their hands. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnna signed the agreement but almost immediately destroyed it and \ndeclared herself Autocrat. She went on to exile, execute, or imprison \nher opposition. During her 10-year reign, she reactivated the Secret \nChancery, a secret police force, and exiled 20,000 to 30,000 people \nto Siberia.\u0014\n\u0014\nA frequent target of her cruelty was Prince Mikhail Golitsyn, who was \nmade to publicly imitate a chicken laying eggs simply because he had \nmarried an Italian and converted to Catholicism. When Golitsyn's wife \ndied, Anna forced him to wed one of her servants and spend his \nhoneymoon weeks in a Palladian-style palace built especially for the \noccasion at a cost of 30,000 rubles. Unfortunately it was carved \ncompletely from ice and floated on the Neva River during the \nespecially harsh winter of 1739-40. While Anna and her court watched \nand jeered, the unhappy couple was transported to their frigid prison \nin a cage atop an elephant.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she wasn't indulging her penchant for sadistic pranks, Anna \nordered the rebuilding of the Russian navy, the establishment of fire \nbrigades in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the inauguration of a \npostal service. She also created the first imperial theater troupe \nand the first Russian ballet school. However, she's been remembered \nmore for her cruelty than for her achievements.\u0014\n  -------History Book Club 12/6/02\u0014",

    "title": "RAISING CANE",
    "words": "Raising Cane \u0014\n\u0014\nby Elesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nLately we've been getting a lot of e-mails inquiring about the \norigins of various Christmas customs. We'll take a look at some of \nthese legends, starting with the candy cane.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom searching the Web on \"candy cane story,\" I learned that the \nconfection's conception is a very hot topic among Christians. On \ncountless homepages, as well as in several gift books, every facet of \nthe cane's construction was attributed spiritual significance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to most of these sources, a faithful Indiana candymaker \ndeveloped the treat as a witnessing tool. The candy is hard because \nGod's church is founded on the rock, white because of Jesus's purity \n(or his virgin birth), peppermint flavored as a reference to \ncleansing hyssop, and curved to represent a shepherd's staff and/or \nthe letter \"J\" for Jesus. Accounts vary regarding the red stripes, \nthough they all agree that red stands for Christ's blood. Depending \non which story you read, three small stripes might represent the \nTrinity, or small stripes could mean the stripes by which we're \nhealed, or our small sacrifices in comparison to Christ's ultimate \nsacrifice (represented by a large stripe). One site even suggested \nthat the green stripe sometimes featured reminds us that Jesus is a \ngift from God, though why green signifies a gift I don't know.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe motivation for candy cane apologetics can be seen in a quote from \none of the sites: \"Doesn't it seem strange that something we often \nsee as unimportant and insignificant can be turned into something so \nvibrant, so important, simply by knowing its origin?\" Of course, the \nsame site proclaims that candy canes were originally a code between \nEnglish Christians in the seventeenth century, when all public \nreligious symbols were banned. That's simply not true, and neither \nare most of the other stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo where did candy canes come from? Tradition holds that in about \n1670, the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral was frustrated by fidgety \nkids at the living Nativity. He had some white, sugar-candy sticks \nmade to keep the youngsters quiet. The sticks were curved like \nshepherds' staffs in honor of the shepherds at the stable (score one \nfor the apologists). The idea caught on, and candy sticks became \ncommon at living Nativities all over Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1847, a German-Swedish immigrant named August Imgard put candy \ncanes on his Christmas tree in Wooster, Ohio. The sweets gained \npopularity here, too, and around the turn of the century, they \nassumed their now familiar properties of red stripes and peppermint \nflavoring. (Though these elements might have been added for symbolic \npurposes, there's no evidence to confirm that theory.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Albany, Georgia, in the 1920s, a candymaker named Bob McCormack \nmade canes as special treats for family and friends, but the \nconfections were difficult to mass-produce. Then, in the 1950s, Bob's \nbrother-in-law Gregory Keller, a Catholic priest, invented a machine \nto speed up the process. Other members of the McCormack family worked \non new packaging to keep the canes from breaking in transit, and \nBob's Candies (www.bobscandies.com) became the world's leading candy \ncane producer.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo yes, the candy cane's origin was Christian. But it was almost \ncertainly not designed to be the tasty theological treatise it's now \npurported to be. As Barbara \"the cane mutiny\" Mikkelson posted on the \nUrban Legends Reference Pages \u0014\n(www.snopes2.com/holidays/xmas/cndycane.htm), \"It's charming folklore \nat best, and though there's nothing wrong with Christians now finding \n(and celebrating) symbolism where there wasn't any before, there is \nsomething wrong with myths being presented as fact.\" For the sake of \nhistory, I have to agree with her.\u0014",

    "title": "REINDEER: THE TRUTH BEHIND THE LEGEND",
    "words": "Reindeer: \nThe Truth Behind the Legend\u0014\n\u0014\nEach Christmas season we hear the stories of the eight flying \nreindeer that pull Santa's sleigh all over the world in one night. \nWhile we have our doubts about that legend, we think that some of the \nreal facts about reindeer are equally fascinating. Do you know why, \nfor instance, none of Santa's reindeer can possibly be adult males? \nHow about what makes a reindeer uniquely equipped to come to a \nlanding stop on an icy rooftop? Did you know that reindeer are \nexcellent swimmers? Read on to learn some of the secrets of the \nworld's most famous deer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre Reindeer for Real?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Donner and Blitzen and the gang are the stuff of legend, \nreindeer are not. These large deer live in northerly climes, in North \nAmerica, Europe, Asia, and the Arctic. In Eurasia (and the North \nPole) they are called reindeer and in North America more commonly \ncaribou, but they are all the same species. The wild herds of Alaska \nand Canada are known for their mass migrations, while large numbers \nof those in Eurasia are domesticated, raised for fur, meat, milk, and \nas work animals. Whether you call them reindeer or caribou, one \nthings is certain: they are physically well suited to a pull a sleigh \nfull of toys and a right jolly old elf. \u0014\n\u0014\nQuestions and Antlers\u0014\n\u0014\nWe've seen the pictures and we know that Santa's reindeer -- Dasher \nand Dancer and Blitzen and the rest -- sport antlers. Does this mean \nthat all of them (even Vixen?) are males? Not exactly -- in fact, it \nalmost means the opposite. Reindeer and caribou are unique among deer \nin that the females grow antlers, too. And even more interesting is \nthe fact that the females retain their antlers from one spring till \nthe next, while mature males shed their antlers in the fall -- and \nare unadorned on Christmas Eve. So the creatures that pull Santa's \nsleigh must be females or youngsters. The only other explanation is \nthat flying somehow alters a reindeer's hormonal cycle so that even \nmature males keep their antlers through the holidays. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll-Terrain Feet\u0014\n\u0014\nThe all-terrain vehicle enables humans to traverse rough, muddy, \nsnowy, or icy terrain. The caribou or reindeer has it beat: it has an \nall-terrain foot. The animal's remarkable hoof actually adapts itself \nto the season -- becoming a sort of ice skate in the winter and \nsneaker in spring. The caribou of North America can run at speeds of \nalmost 50 miles per hour and may travel 3,000 miles in a year. \nLuckily, the animal is helped along by its amazingly adaptable \nfootpads. In the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the \nfootpads become spongy like the soles of tennis shoes and provide \nextra traction. In the winter, when snow and ice coat the North, the \npads shrink and firm up, while the rim of the hoof, like an ice \nskate's blade, bites into the ice and crusted snow to keep the animal \nfrom slipping. Sounds like the perfect footwear for an animal that \nneeds to come to a flying stop on an ice-encrusted rooftop in the \ndark of the night! \u0014\n\u0014\nFur Float \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven its geographic preferences, a reindeer has to have a pretty \nwarm coat. In fact, the coat has two layers of fur, a dense woolly \nundercoat and longer-haired overcoat. The outer coat consists of \nhollow, air-filled hairs that give the animal such buoyancy when it \nenters water that only the lower two-thirds of its body submerges. A \ncaribou or reindeer swims with ease and good speed, and migrating \nherds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river. \nIf Santa ever decides to take to the seas rather than the air, he is \nin good hands!\u0014",

Lee (1807-1870) took up arms against the United States \nin 1861, his father, Revolutionary War hero and Virginia governor \nHenry \"Light-Horse Harry\" Lee, had been dead for 43 years. No one \nknows what Henry Lee would have thought of his son's decision to \nrebel against his own country, but he had once said, \"In all local \nmatters I shall be a Virginian, but in things of a general nature I \nshall not forget that I am an American.\" Robert E.

He distinguished himself in battle during the Mexican War of \n1846-1848, earning hearty praise from General Winfield Scott, the \ncommander of US forces.

    "title": "RECONCILING TEXTUAL CRITICISM AND INSPIRATION",
    "words": "Question:  How can I reconcile my belief in the inerrancy of \nScripture with comments in Bible translations that state that a \nparticular verse in not in \"better manuscripts?\"\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nTHE ANSWER to this question parallels that of Charles Spurgeon who, \nwhen asked to reconcile human freedom with divine predestination, \nsaid, \"I never reconcile friends.\" He maintained that the two \nrealities fit together. So here.\u0014\n\u0014\nManuscripts first. The New Testament books first circulated in \nhand-copied form, and hand-copying by monks went on till Gutenberg \ninvented the printing press in the 15th century. Anyone who has \ncopied by hand knows how easily letters, words, and even whole lines \nget dropped out or repeated. The New Testament manuscript tradition \nwas not exempt from this.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, it is clear that some copyists facing what they thought were \nmiscopyings made what they thought were corrections. Some of these \ncopyists added in the margin amplifying words and sentences that the \nnext copyist put into the text itself, thinking that was where they \nbelonged. Because the copying was done reverently and with \nprofessional care, manuscripts vary little overall, except for the \noccasional slippages of this kind. Manuscript comparison reveals many \npassages that clearly need correcting at this level of detail.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe King James Version New Testament was translated from the \n\"received text\"-- the dominant manuscript tradition at the time--and \npublished in 1516. New manuscript discoveries have led to minor \nadjustments to that text, and where uncertainty remains about exact \nwording or authenticity, the margins of honest modern versions will \ntell us so. The New King James, for instance, while still following \nthe received text, notes these things conscientiously as it goes \nalong. Other things being equal, manuscripts are \"better\" when they \nare nearer to the original-that is, earlier in date.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the New Testament only one word per 1,000 is in any way doubtful, \nand no point of doctrine is lost when verses not \"in better \nmanuscripts\" are omitted. (As examples, see Matt. 6:13b, 17:21, \n18:11; Mark 9:44, 46, 49, 16:9-20; Luke 23:17; John 5:4; and Acts \n8:37.) Such has been God's \"singular care and providence\" in \npreserving his written Word for us (Westminster Confession I.viii).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how does all this bear on the Christian's very proper faith in \nbiblical inerrancy-that is, the total truth and trustworthiness of \nthe true text and all it teaches?\u0014\n\u0014\nHoly Scripture is, according to the view of Jesus and his apostles, \nGod preaching, instructing, showing, and telling us things, and \ntestifying to himself through the human witness of prophets, poets, \ntheological narrators of history, and philosophical observers of \nlife. The Bible's inerrancy is not the inerrancy of anyone published \ntext or version, nor of anyone's interpretation, nor of any scribal \nslips or pious inauthentic additions acquired\u0014\nduring transmission.\u0014\n\u0014\nRather, scriptural inerrancy relates to the human writer's expressed \nmeaning in\u0014\neach book, and to the Bible's whole body of revealed truth and wisdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelief in inerrancy involves an advance commitment to receive as from \nGod all that the Bible, interpreting itself to us through the Holy \nSpirit in a natural and coherent way, teaches. Thus it shapes our \nunderstanding of biblical authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo inerrantists should welcome the work of textual scholars, who are \nforever trying to eliminate the inauthentic and give us exactly what \nthe biblical writers wrote, neither more nor less. The way into God's \nmind is through his penmen's minds, precisely as expressed, under his \nguidance, in their own words as they wrote them.\u0014\n\u0014\nText criticism serves inerrancy; they are friends. Inerrancy \ntreasures the meaning of each writer's words, while text criticism \nchecks that we have each writer's words pure and intact. Both these \nwisdoms are needed if we are to benefit fully from the written Word \nof God. \u0014\n\u0014\nJ. I. Packer\u0014",

What of Henry III, or William II, or King Stephen? Now, with \nCarolly Ericksons Royal Panoply, readers can discover, or \nrediscover, each of the forty monarchs who have sat on the throne of \nEngland, from the Norman Conquest to the present day. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this History Book Club exclusive, biographer nonpareil Erickson \nsurveys the history of England through the prism of concise \nbiographies of each of its anointed sovereigns. Only a historian of \nEricksons consummate skill could pull such a project off without \nsacrificing depth or subtlety. For each of these biographical essays \nis like a biography in miniature, exploring the personality of each \nmonarch, his or her motivations and drives, and the tenor of their \ntimes on the throne. Readers will come away feeling they have met \neach of these rulers and walked in their shoes (in some cases, \nstraight onto the gallows or into the Tower).\u0014\n\u0014\nBe prepared to revise your perception of some of the most celebrated \nsovereignsand to learn all manner of things anew. Did you know, for \nexample, that demure Elizabeth I was prone to rages so violent that \nshe was known to strike her ladies in waiting with heavy \ncandlesticks? That George IV was such a hopeless dandy that he kept \nhis toilet seat covered in swansdown (giving new meaning to the term \nroyal throne)? Or that Henry VI eschewed kingly robes in favor of \nthe unassuming attire of a yeoman farmer? \u0014\n\u0014\nBesides surprising facts, Erickson presents richly textured portraits \nof the famous and infamous men and women who carved out Englands \nimperial destiny. Some cut larger-than-life figures, such as the \nirascible William the Conqueror, whose founding reign was embroiled \nin conflict from start to finish. Others emerge as unfit for the \ncrown, but by that very fact seemingly more human and sympathetic. \nTheres the awkward Charles I, melancholic Richard II, and James I \nstruggling with his sexual identity. Perhaps most fascinating of all \nare the abject failuresHenry III, for one, a weak ruler detested by \nhis barons, or the feckless Stephen, whose refusal to assert the \nprerogatives of his crown invited civil war.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, no book of profiles of English monarchs would be complete \nwithout what the latter-day English novelist Anthony Burgess would \ncall the old ultraviolence. Royal Panoply chronicles it all: Edward \nIIs grisly demise at the point of a burning poker, Queen Mary \nsuccumbing to the scourge of smallpox, Charles I on the chopping \nblock, and gloomy Richard II wasting away in the Tower.\u0014\n\u0014\nFramed with five introductory essays that provide historical context \nfor the portraits, this collection provides an outstanding \nintroduction to the rich history of England for those so seeking, and \na substantive and entertaining refresher course for those already \nsteeped in royal heritage. 384 PAGES  8 1/2\" X 10\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: CAROLLY ERICKSON is the author most recently of \nAlexandra: The Last Tsarina.\u0014",

    "words": "May 3, 2003\u0014\nRelentless Moral Crusader Is Relentless Gambler\u0014\nBy KATHARINE Q. SEELYE\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON, May 2  William J. Bennett, author of \"The Book of \nVirtues\" and one of the nation's most relentless moral crusaders, is \na high-rolling gambler who has lost more than $8 million at casinos \nin the last decade, according to online reports from two magazines. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Washington Monthly said on its Web site that \"over the last \ndecade Bennett has made dozens of trips to casinos in Atlantic City \nand Las Vegas, where he is a `preferred customer' at several of them, \nand sources and documents provided to The Washington Monthly put his \ntotal losses at more than $8 million.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an article that depends on much the same reporting, the online \nversion of Newsweek said that 40 pages of internal casino documents \nshow that Mr. Bennett received treatment typical of high-stakes \ngamblers, including limousines and \"tens of thousands of dollars in \ncomplimentary hotel rooms and other amenities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bennett, who has served Republican presidents as education \nsecretary and drug czar, declined to be interviewed today by The New \nYork Times, with a spokesman saying that he needed to digest the \narticles before responding.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact of Mr. Bennett's gambling is not new. He has said over the \nyears that he likes to gamble and that it relaxes him. What is \nunusual is the apparent extent of his losses; neither magazine \nreported his winnings.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bennett told the magazines that he has basically broken even over \nthe years. \"I play fairly high stakes,\" he said, adding, \"I don't put \nmy family at risk, and I don't owe anyone anything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe magazines said they had no documentation that he was in debt but \nsuggested that he had lost more than he had won. In response, Mr. \nBennett is quoted as saying, \"I've made a lot of money and I've won a \nlot of money,\" adding, \"You don't see what I walk away with.\" He said \nhe gave some of his winnings to charity and reported everything to \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe magazines said that in one two-month period, Mr. Bennett wired \none casino more than $1.4 million to cover his losses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe magazines say he earns $50,000 for each appearance in speaking \nfees on the lecture circuit, where he inveighs against various sins, \nweaknesses and vices of modern culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Bennett exempts gambling from this list.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has said in the past that he does not consider gambling a moral \nissue. When his interviewers reminded him of studies that link heavy \ngambling with a variety of societal and family ills, Mr. Bennett said \nhe did not have a problem himself and likened gambling to drinking \nalcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I view it as drinking,\" he said. \"If you can't handle it, don't do \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bennett is popular among social conservatives, but many of them \nconsider gambling a serious problem. James C. Dobson, the president \nof Focus on the Family and a member of a federal commission that \nstudied gambling, said in 1999: \"Gambling fever now threatens the \nwork ethic and the very foundation of the family. Thirty years ago, \ngambling was widely understood in the culture to be addictive, \nprogressive and dangerous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1990's, leaders of the conservative Christian Coalition joined \nwith other religious leaders to create the National Coalition Against \nLegalized Gambling. Ralph Reed, former executive director of the \nChristian Coalition, called gambling \"a cancer on the American body \npolitic\" that was \"stealing food from the mouths of children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFriends of Mr. Bennett were reluctant today to criticize him directly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's his own money and his own business,\" Grover G. Norquist, \npresident of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative advocacy group, \nsaid. \"The downside of gambling losses is that the government gets a \nthird of the money, which is unfortunate and probably a sin in and of \nitself,\" said Mr. Norquist, whose group advocates smaller government.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard and another \nconservative ally of Mr. Bennett, agreed that this was a matter \nbetween Mr. Bennett, his wife and his accountant.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It would be different if he had written anti-gambling screeds,\" Mr. \nKristol said. \"I'm sure he doesn't regard gambling as a virtue but as \na rather minor and pardonable vice and a legal one and one that has \nnot damaged him or anyone else.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Kristol said that Mr. Bennett was not being hypocritical. \"If \nBill Bennett went on TV encouraging young people to gamble the rent \nmoney at a Las Vegas casino or was shilling for gambling interests, \nthat would be inconsistent\" with his moral crusades, Mr. Kristol said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mr. Bennett told The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 1995, \"I've \nplayed poker all my life and I shouldn't be on my high horse about \nit.\"\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "title": "ROBERT E. LEE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR",
    "words": "With his army virtually surrounded near Appomattox, Virginia in April \n1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant, \neffectively ending the Civil War. Grant's terms were generous: Lee \nand his men would be allowed to keep their pistols and horses and \nreturn home as free men. After reading the terms to his emotional \ntroops, Lee told them, \"Men, we have fought the war together, and I \nhave done the best I could for you ... be good citizens as you have \nbeen good soldiers.\" Lee intended to resume his life as a good \ncitizen of the United States. Instead, a federal court indicted him \nfor treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated just weeks after the \nsurrender, Lee was an obvious scapegoat for Northerners who wanted \nvengeance against the South. Ironically, it was Lee's battlefield \nnemesis, U.S. Grant, who came to his rescue. Grant threatened to \nresign unless President Andrew Johnson honored the terms of the \nsurrender. Johnson withdrew the charges of treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe post-war Robert E. Lee never gave Northerners cause for alarm. He \ncooperated with federal Reconstruction policies to reorganize the \nSouthern states, even if he did not agree with them, and advised his \nfellow Southerners to do the same. His example of grace in defeat is \noften credited with preventing a guerrilla war by defiant Southerners.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1866, he was appointed president of Washington College (now \nWashington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia, where he moved \nhis family and made his first real home since before the war. But, \nLee never officially regained his civil rights as a citizen of the \nUnited States. At least not until 1975 (105 years after his death), \nwhen Congress pardoned him for his role in the Civil War.\u0014",

It happened to be Mrs. Kennedy. That \nfirst impression of her\u0014\n                   stepping to the door will linger forever.

He was hammering the \nground with his fist, with\u0014\n                   his other arm over the boy protecting him, just in \nanguish.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   MALCOLM KILDUFF, assistant White House press \nsecretary: We went\u0014\n                   around Vice President Johnson's car because it had \nslowed up, and we\u0014\n                   wanted to get up and catch up with the president's \ncar. We sped off down the\u0014\n                   highway. The normal emergency procedure with shots \nis to just speed out, to\u0014\n                   get out of there as quickly as possible. At this \npoint, it was still perfectly\u0014\n                   normal--until we passed the Trade Mart. I asked \nthe driver of our car, \"What\u0014\n                   is that large building up there ahead?\" He said, \n\"Parkland Hospital.\" Naturally\u0014\n                   you realized that somebody had been hurt, at \nleast. It didn't occur to a single\u0014\n                   person in that car that the president of the \nUnited States really had been\u0014\n                   shot.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   NEAR THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS \u0014\n\u0014\n                   PIERCE ALLMAN, WFAA-TV and Radio: There were three \nshots. They were\u0014\n                   very distinct. Later on, in asking to re-create \nthe time sequence, my timing\u0014\n                   on it was six and a half seconds. It was a very, \nvery vivid memory. Mr.\u0014\n                   Kennedy really didn't slump. He sort of jerked up, \nand his arms went up and\u0014\n                   his hands went up towards his chin. As the shots \ncontinued, Jackie\u0014\n                   screamed something and tried to get up. Kennedy \nbegan slumping to the left,\u0014\n                   and Jackie got out of her seat and was going over \ntoward her husband as he\u0014\n                   was coming toward her. About that time, the Secret \nService man sprinted in\u0014\n                   from the trailing car and vaulted over the left \nrear fender and put himself on\u0014\n                   top of both of them and shoved them down. That's \nwhen they were both down\u0014\n                   in the back seat and Kennedy's foot was dangling \nover the side.\u0014\nYNESWORTH, Dallas Morning News:\u0014\n                   People didn't know where to run. Nobody\u0014\n                   knew where the shots were coming from.\u0014\n                   Nobody knew who had been hit, if anybody.\u0014\n                   Nobody knew where to run to protect\u0014\n                   themselves. . . . The lady [wearing the same\u0014\n                   pink outfit as Jackie] threw up, she was sick\u0014\n                   . . . I started interviewing people, but I didn't\u0014\n                   have a pencil or paper. I reached in my back\u0014\n                   pocket. I had two utility bills that I hadn't\u0014\n                   mailed. I used the backs of those\u0014\n                   envelopes. I saw a little kid that had one of \nthese big jumbo pens, had a big\u0014\n                   American flag on it. And I grabbed that because I \nhad to start writing and\u0014\n                   interviewing. I gave him a quarter or two.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   IN THE PRESS-POOL CAR \u0014\n\u0014\n                   BOB CLARK, ABC News: There was one pool telephone \nin the car.\u0014\n                   [Merriman Smith] was sitting next to it, and that \nwas because of his\u0014\n                   experience and his years as a White House \nreporter. Part of the press\u0014\n                   mythology is that Smitty immediately grabbed the \nphone and began talking,\u0014\n                   dictating a bulletin. He did not. . . . Before he \npicked up the phone, he just\u0014\n                   sat for a minute or two--a minute or two where \n[the AP's Jack] Bell could\u0014\n                   have reached forward from the back and gotten the \nphone. But he did not.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Eventually Smitty started dictating. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   ROBERT BASKIN, Washington bureau chief, Dallas \nMorning News: Smith\u0014\n                   grabbed the radiotelephone, which hung just in \nfront of him on the dashboard\u0014\n                   and got through to UPI quickly. \"Where did that \nhappen? Where did that\u0014\n                   happen?\" he shouted at me. For the life of me, I \ncould not get the words out,\u0014\n                   and the driver told him it was at the triple \nunderpass. Jack Bell began to\u0014\n                   demand the telephone as we raced along, but Smith \nwould not relinquish it.\u0014\n                   A wrestling match for the phone ensued.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   KILDUFF, White House: Jack Bell got tired of \nwaiting to dictate. He reached\u0014\n                   over, grabbed the phone, and swiped at Smith with \nit--and hit me instead.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   HELEN THOMAS, White House correspondent, United \nPress International: It\u0014\n                   was the ultimate rivalry for the story of the \ncentury. [Smith] always knew how\u0014\n                   to look for the phone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   12:34 P.M. \u0014\n                   DALLAS BUREAU, UPI \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Smith calls in and begins dictating to Wilborn \nHampton, a young reporter\u0014\n                   who has been on the job only two months.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   WILBORN HAMPTON: I was standing next to the news \ndesk. One of the\u0014\n                   telephones rang, and I picked it up, and this \nvoice was shouting, \"Three\u0014\n                   shots were fired at the motorcade! Make it a \nbulletin precede\" [an alert that\u0014\n                   new developments had occurred in an earlier \nstory]. I literally nearly dropped\u0014\n                   the phone. I cradled it next to my ear . . . I \nsaid, \"I can't hear you.\" He\u0014\n                   screamed, \"Three shots were fired at the \nmotorcade! Make it a bulletin\u0014\n                   precede.\" . . . I said, \"I'm having trouble \nhearing you.\" He shouted a third\u0014\n                   time. This time I was stepping over to [UPI \ndivision news manager] Jack\u0014\n                   Fallon, and I was almost afraid to interrupt him. \nI almost whispered, \"Jack,\u0014\n                   it's Smitty.\" He said, \"What does he want?\" \"He \nsaid there were three shots\u0014\n                   fired at the motorcade.\" Jack said, \"What?\" and \ngrabbed the phone from my\u0014\n                   hand. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   [A moment later] it occurred to me who would know \nwhat was going on: a\u0014\n                   police dispatcher. . . . I called the Dallas \npolice main number and tried to\u0014\n                   muster all the authority I didn't feel and said, \n\"This is Bill Hampton, UPI. Give\u0014\n                   me dispatch.\" To my utter amazement, somebody \npicked up the phone and\u0014\n                   said, \"Dispatch.\" I said, \"What can you tell me \nabout the shots that were\u0014\n                   fired at the president's motorcade?\" He said, \"The \npresident has been hit. I\u0014\n                   just got off the phone with the motorcycle \npoliceman right next to the car,\u0014\n                   and they're going to Parkland Hospital.\" I said, \n\"How bad?\" He said, \"I don't\u0014\n                   know, there's blood in the back of the car, and \nthe president has fallen over\u0014\n                   and they're going to Parkland right now.\"\u0014\n12:36 P.M. \u0014\n                   PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The four reporters in the pool car are the\u0014\n                   first journalists to reach the hospital.\u0014\n                   President Kennedy is still in the limo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   MERRIMAN SMITH, White House correspondent, UPI: We \nskidded around\u0014\n                   a sharp turn and spilled out of the pool car as it \nentered the hospital\u0014\n                   driveway. I ran to the side of the [car]. The \npresident was face down on the\u0014\n                   back seat. Mrs. Kennedy made a cradle of her arms \naround the president's\u0014\n                   head and bent over him as if she were whispering \nto him. Governor Connally\u0014\n                   was on his back on the floor of the car. His head \nand shoulders resting in the\u0014\n                   arms of his wife, Nellie, who kept shaking her \nhead and shaking with dry\u0014\n                   sobs. Blood oozed from the front of the governor's \nsuit. I could not see the\u0014\n                   president's wound. But I could see blood \nsplattered around the interior of the\u0014\n                   rear seat and a dark stain spreading down the \nright side of the president's\u0014\n                   dark gray suit.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   CLARK, ABC News: Relations were much better with \nthe Secret Service in\u0014\n                   those days. . . . They simply let us go up and \nstand as close as we could.\u0014\n                   We were standing literally a couple of feet from \nthe car, staring down at\u0014\n                   Kennedy. He was stretched out in the back seat. He \nwas lying with the side\u0014\n                   of his head exposed and his head in Jackie's lap . \n. . It was just a frozen\u0014\n                   scene. Jackie was sitting there, saying nothing. \nWe had to wait a minute or\u0014\n                   so for the stretchers to come out.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   SMITH, UPI: Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent \nin charge of the detail\u0014\n                   assigned to Mrs. Kennedy, was leaning over into \nthe rear of the car. \"How\u0014\n                   badly was he hit, Clint?\" I asked. \"He's dead,\" \nHill replied curtly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The president is pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m., but \nthe news is not released\u0014\n                   for a half-hour, while aides try to decide where \nthe new president--Lyndon B.\u0014\n                   Johnson--should take the oath of office.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   2:30 P.M. \u0014\n                   ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE AT LOVE FIELD \u0014\n\u0014\n                   KILDUFF, White House: As soon as I got to the \nplane, Jim Swindal, the\u0014\n                   president's pilot, said, \"The president has been \nlooking for you.\" I walked in\u0014\n                   and I talked to the president. He said, \"Mac, I've \ngot to get sworn in here. . . .\u0014\n                   They feel I should be sworn in here in Dallas. \nWe're trying to get hold of the\u0014\n                   judge.\" He said, \"Do we have to allow some of the \npress in here?\" I said,\u0014\n                   \"Yes, we do.\"\u0014\n                   ROBERTS, Newsweek: The curtains were\u0014\n                   drawn. They had gotten the president's\u0014\n                   casket aboard by removing some seats from\u0014\n                   the back of the airplane. They were waiting\u0014\n                   for the press--the president, I later learned,\u0014\n                   had insisted on some press witnesses to\u0014\n                   his swearing-in--and for Judge Sarah\u0014\n                   Hughes. . . . She arrived and was taken\u0014\n                   aboard. Then Kilduff gave us the signal to\u0014\n                   come aboard. I can remember Smitty as we\u0014\n                   crowded aboard the plane. We went up the\u0014\n                   forward ramp and were pushing back toward the \nmidsection of the plane.\u0014\n                   Smitty looked down at his right hand and said, \"My \nGod, I've lost my\u0014\n                   typewriter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   SMITH, UPI: All of the shades of the larger main \ncabin were drawn. The\u0014\n                   interior was hot and dimly lighted. Kilduff \npropelled us toward the president's\u0014\n                   suite two thirds of the way back in the plane. I \nwedged inside the door and\u0014\n                   began counting. There were 27 people in the \ncompartment. Johnson stood in\u0014\n                   the center with his wife, Lady Bird. U.S. District \nJudge Sarah T. Hughes, a\u0014\n                   kindly faced woman, stood with a small black Bible \nin her hands, waiting to\u0014\n                   give the oath. . . . The compartment became hotter \nand hotter. It developed\u0014\n                   that Johnson was waiting for Mrs. Kennedy, who was \ncomposing herself in a\u0014\n                   small bedroom in the rear of the plane. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   SID DAVIS, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.: It was \njust a matter of minutes\u0014\n                   until Mrs. Kennedy appeared. I was startled when I \nsaw her because I had\u0014\n                   never seen her with a hair out of place. . . . her \nright stocking was saturated\u0014\n                   with blood from her husband's head wound. By that \ntime, it was caked on her\u0014\n                   right leg. I saw some blood on her skirt and on \nher right wrist. She had said\u0014\n                   at the time she didn't change her dress because \nshe wanted the people of\u0014\n                   Dallas to see what they had done.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   ROBERTS, Newsweek: [Kennedy aide] Larry O'Brien \nfound a Bible in the\u0014\n                   president's sleeping compartment . . . .

There was a \nminute or so of awkward\u0014\n                   silence, and the president turned and kissed Lady \nBird. He embraced Jackie,\u0014\n                   holding her by the elbows. The first words I \nremember immediately after the\u0014\n                   oath were Chief [Jesse] Curry of the Dallas police \nsaying to Mrs. Kennedy,\u0014\n                   \"You'd better go and lie down now, honey,\" or \n\"little lady,\" or some diminutive\u0014\n                   affectionate like that. \"You've had a real bad \nday.\" Whether Mrs. Kennedy\u0014\n                   heard him, I don't know. She didn't leave right \naway. There was handshaking\u0014\n                   all around, but a very solemn sort of handshaking. \nAnd then Mrs. Kennedy\u0014\n                   did go aft, and then the president turned and \nsaid, \"Now, let's get airborne.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   DAVIS, WBC: It was really the most amazing thing. \nWhat you had was the\u0014\n                   new president of the United States on the \nairplane, the body of the fallen\u0014\n                   president in a casket in the back . . .

    "title": "REMAINS OF HIPPOLYTUS",
    "words": "August 13, 236 \u0014\n\u0014\nRemains of Hippolytus\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe believers from the City of Rome were solemn. Under persecution, \nmany Christians had been killed at various times. \"Witnesses,\" they \ncalled these martyrs. The bodies of two witnesses who died in exile \nhad come home on this day, August 13, 236.*\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Maximinus Thrax was Roman emperor, he exiled Pontianus and \nHippolytus to the island of Sardinia where they probably slaved in \nthe mines. There they died, but now their remains had been brought \nback for a decent burial. Pontianus, who had been Bishop of Rome \nuntil his exile, was laid in the tomb of Callistus, an earlier Bishop \nof Rome (they would come to be known as popes, from the Italian for \n\"father\"). Hippolytus, who had also been a bishop in or near Rome, \nwas buried somewhere along the Tiburtine Road.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the two, Hippolytus' story is more interesting because we know \nnext to nothing about Pontianus. Hippolytus was the most important \ntheologian of the Roman Church up to that time, although his work was \nshelved for centuries afterward because it was written in Greek which \nthe people of the West forgot how to read. One of his books was \nagainst heresy. In it he explained what the Gnostics (who believed \nthey were saved by secret knowledge) and other groups taught and \nshowed where they went wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis would be enough to make Hippolytus worth remembering. But above \nall that, his case is often cited in arguments regarding the \nauthority of the Roman Church and its claim that popes are infallible \nwhen speaking ex cathedra.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo begin with, Hippolytus was a \"great-grandson\" of St. John the \nApostle. That is, we can trace his line of apostolic succession \ndirectly to John. He was commissioned by St. Irenaeus, who was \ncommissioned by Polycarp, who was commissioned by (or at least \npersonally knew) St. John himself. So there can be no question about \nhis legitimacy as a bishop.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the fourth century on, the Roman Church venerated Hippolytus as \na saint. Even popes have acknowledged him as a saint. Yet he was also \nthe first antipope (one \"illegally\" elected at the same time).\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could this be? Hippolytus spoke out strongly against the \nwrongdoing, cruelty and doctrinal errors of the bishops of Rome. This \nstruck a responsive chord with the Roman population, who elected him \nBishop of Rome in opposition to Bishop Callistus. Hippolytus \ncontinued in opposition to the bishops of Rome until he went into \nexile. While in exile, there are indications that he was reconciled \nwith Pontianus. \u0014\n\u0014\nHippolytus was an expert on heresy. The fact that he insisted that \nsome of the popes of his day were heretics was a strong reason that \nmany scholars could not agree when the Vatican Council declared the \npopes infallible in 1870.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sixteenth century, workmen digging near an ancient church on \nthe Tiburtine Road uncovered a marble statue. This was of a bishop \nseated in a chair, wearing a pallium (a cloth that symbolizes full \nepiscopal authority). Pope Pius IV declared it to be Saint \nHippolytus. Carved on the back of the chair were a list of \nHippolytus' writings.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Although the day seems fairly secure, the year is open to question.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "On 9/11 I thought: For the most powerful, militarized nation in the \nworld also to think of itself as an innocent victim is deadly. It was \na rare prophetic moment for me, considering Presidents Bush and Obama \nhave spent billions asking the military to rectify the crime of a \nsmall band of lawless individuals, destroying a couple of nations who \nhad little to do with it, in the costliest, longest series of wars in \nthe history of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe silence of most Christians and the giddy enthusiasm of a few, as \nwell as the ubiquity of flags and patriotic extravaganzas in \nallegedly evangelical churches, says to me that American Christians \nmay look back upon our response to 9/11 as our greatest \nChristological defeat. It was shattering to admit that we had lost \nthe theological means to distinguish between the United States and \nthe kingdom of God. The criminals who perpetrated 9/11 and the \nflag-waving boosters of our almost exclusively martial response were \nof one mind: that the nonviolent way of Jesus is stupid. All of us \npreachers share the shame; when our people felt very vulnerable, they \nreached for the flag, not the Cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 11 has changed me.

    "title": "REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS",
    "words": "Remembering Christopher Hitchens\u0014\nCrying freedom \u0014\nDec 17th 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nCROSSING an Athens street by foot on a warm spring afternoon in 1985, \nI checked a taxi waiting at the light to make sure it was not going \nto jump the red. In the back seat I spied the unmistakeable figure of \nChristopher Hitchens, larger than when Id last seen him, larger than \nanyone in their mid-30s ought to be, made larger still by an \nunnecessary overcoat thrown over the shoulders in the manner of a \nballet impresario from an earlier time. He saw me, called my name, \nthrew open the door and stepped into the street. The light was now \ngreen and traffic was hooting. Heedless as ever to context but wholly \nin role, he let go an uncounted shower of drachma notes into the \ngrateful drivers hand and greeted me theatrically with a kiss on \nboth cheeks. Like me, he was in Athens to write about the Greek \nelections. The previous day, Andreas Papandreouthe father of the \nrecently replaced prime ministerhad handily won a second \nparliamentary term as leader of his countrys Social Democrats. \nThough not like me, because Christopher was not like other \njournalists. I didnt see you at the Press centre last night, I \nsaid. No, he replied, I was at the Papandreous.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow the next hours unfolded, I dont recall. I do vividly remember \nthat around two in the morning, Christopher was entertaining a small \ngroup of us at a restaurantquoting, parrying, recounting, provoking. \nHis speed of memory was daunting. He always seemed able to cite what \nan opponent in argument had said or written years earlier, deploying \nit quickly and wittily at the surest moment to expose them as fools, \nditherers or hypocrites. That essentially 18th-century skill made him \nas lethal on television as he was on the page. He wrote the way he \nspoke, in boutades and in paragraphs, often with a blood-level of \nalcohol that would leave most of us speechless. He was catholic in \nhis love and knowledge of the written word, but on the whole stayed \noff movies, theatre, visual arts and music. Had he a trace of Puritan \nsuspicion that such arts were elite, effete and not morally serious? \nI suspect it was more that each of those arts has its standards of \nperformance and he was a performer in a competing mediumhis own \nwords. You had to hear him in real time, and I rate myself lucky that \non a few occasions I did hear him at tableusually late on when \neveryone else had stopped talking, not because they were silenced or \nbested but because there and then it was simply more satisfying to \nlisten to him. \u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know, and who does, if his copious writing will stand up in \nthe way that the work of his politico-literary hero George Orwell has \nstood up. Those who found little to admire or agree with in \nChristopher, especially after he backed the Iraq War in 2003, will \nlaugh at the comparison. Even those who enjoyed his overflowing \ntalents as journalist and talker may find it a stretch. Differences \nof water level and achievement stand out. Yet there are likenesses, \ntoo. Neither could tolerate camps, least of all their own: like \nOrwell, Christopher kept his harshest barbs for the left. Neither \nwere doctrinal and, though Christopher took on big topicsnotably \nreligious belief, of which he claimed to have nonehis small-motor \nskills with tricky ideas were no finer than Orwells. Neither were \nreally interested in policy or government, though from sheer forensic \nbravado Christopher would happily take on the best-briefed wonk. Both \nwrote from an essentially emotional perception about the moral \ncondition of the world. Orwell once praised Charles Dickens for the \nvagueness of his radicalism. He did not mean evasiveness or lack of \nclarity, but a deep conviction that something was wrong with society \nand that the only constructive suggestion was: Behave decently. \nChristophers constructive suggestions were never so clear, but his \nnegative drive was unmistakeable and gave him a consistency his \ndetractors wrongly said he lacked: locate power, distrust it and take \nit down a peg, even if you cant knock it off its perch. Odd as it \nsounds, somewhere in Christopher was a backwoods Tory anarchist.\u0014\n\u0014\nStatus and power fascinated him as targets, not as ways to discrimate \namong people. He was open to everyone and called all comers by first \nnamethat memory again!even if they were not near friends. My \ncalling him Christopher repays the compliment. Hitchens would \nsound both too distant and too knowing.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow I think about it, at that restaurant in Athens it was probably \ncloser to three in the morning. Holding up an empty bottle, \nChristopher waved it back and forth to get the attention of a waiter, \nslumped against a far wall. When the waiter came over with a fresh \nbottle, Christopher raised an empty glass to him and cried with a \nByronic flourish, Eleftheria!which means freedom or liberty in \nGreek. In perfect English the waiter shot back, Weve already got \nthat. The exhausted man had made his point and for once Christopher \nhad no comeback. Hes silent now for good, and, agree with him or \ndisagree, its a loss to us all.\u0014",

    "title": "RICH INDIAN CAN'T BUY OUT OF LOWEST CASTE",
    "words": "Rich Indian can't buy out of lowest caste \u0014\n'Life is good for me ... very bad for many, many people,' says \nbusinessman\u0014\n\u0014\nBy TIM SULLIVAN \u0014\n12/22/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAGRA, India  As far back as he can remember, people told Hari \nKishan Pippal that he was unclean, with a filthiness that had tainted \nhis family for centuries. Teachers forced him to sit apart from other \nstudents. Employers sometimes didn't bother to pay him. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPippal is a dalit, a member of the outcast community once known as \nuntouchables. Born at the bottom of Hinduism's complex social ladder, \nthat meant he could not eat with people from higher castes or drink \nfrom their wells. He was not supposed to aspire to a life beyond that \nof his father, an illiterate cobbler. Years later, he still won't \nrepeat the slurs that people called him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, though, people call him something else.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey call him rich.\u0014\n\u0014\nPippal owns a hospital, a shoe factory, a car dealership and a \npublishing company. He owns six cars. He lives in a maze of linked \napartments in a quiet if dusty neighborhood of high walls and \nwrought-iron gates.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In my heart I am dalit. But with good clothes, good food, good \nbusiness, it is like I am high-caste,\" he said, a 60-year-old with a \nshock of white hair, a well-tailored vest and the girth of a \nVictorian gentleman. Now, he points out, he is richer than most \nBrahmins, who sit at the top of the caste hierarchy: \"I am more than \nBrahmin!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in an increasingly globalized nation wrestling with centuries of \ndeeply held caste beliefs, there is little agreement about what that \nmeans. Do Pippal and the handful of other dalit millionaires reflect \na country shrugging off centuries of caste bias? Does caste hold \nstill hold sway the way it used to?\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Hari Kishan Pippal isn't sure.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Life is good for me,\" says Pippal, sitting in his office in Heritage \nHospital, one of the largest private medical facilities in this north \nIndian city. \"But life is very bad for many, many people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nImprovements slowly emerge\u0014\n\u0014\nThe vast majority of India's 170 million dalits live amid a thicket \nof grim statistics: less than a third are literate, well over 40 \npercent survive on less than $2 a day, infant mortality rates are \ndramatically higher than among higher castes. Dalits are far more \nlikely than the overall population to be underweight, and far less \nlikely to get postnatal care.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile caste discrimination has been outlawed for more than 60 years, \nand the term \"untouchable\" is now taboo in public, thousands of \nanti-dalit attacks occur every year. Hundreds of people are killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stories spill from India's newspapers: the 14-year-old dalit \nstrangled because he shared his first name with a higher-caste boy; \nthe 70-year-old man and his disabled daughter burned alive after a \ndalit-owned dog barked at higher-caste neighbors; the man run over at \na gas station because he refused to give up his place in line to a \nhigh-caste customer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut amid centuries of caste tradition that can seem immutable, there \nhas been slow change.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an extensive survey by the Center for the Advanced Study of India \nat the University of Pennsylvania, researchers found that dalits \nliving in concrete homes, not huts made from mud and straw, had \njumped from 18 percent to 64 percent between 1990 and 2007 in one \nnorth Indian district. Ownership of various household goods  fans, \nchairs, pressure cookers and bicycles  had skyrocketed over the same \nperiod.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also found a weakening of some caste traditions, with, for \nexample, far fewer dalits being seated separately at non-dalit \nweddings.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Caste is losing its grip'\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most dalits still support themselves as rural laborers, there \nis also a growing dalit middle class, many of them civil servants who \nhave benefited from affirmative action laws.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Caste is losing its grip,\" said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a dalit writer, \nsocial scientist and one-time Marxist militant who has become a \nleading voice urging the dalit poor to see the virtues of capitalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a consumer society, Prasad argues, wealth can trump caste  at \nleast some of the time. Growing economies also foster urbanization, \nhe says, allowing low-caste Indians to escape traditional village \nstrictures. Finally, economic growth also means that the traditional \nmerchant castes are not large enough to fill every job.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This means other castes also have a chance\" in the business world, \nPrasad said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Prasad, the new millionaires are a way to prove that dalits can \nmake it in a globalized world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Don't say (success) is not possible because of the caste system,\" he \nsaid. \"Here is a list of dalits who are doing so well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe list is impressive, even if its members are far from India's \ntraditional centers of wealth, power and celebrity. They are, for the \nmost part, blue-collar rich, often finding their niches in \nless-glamorous industries: building working-class housing \ndevelopments, manufacturing immense concrete pipes, churning out \ncheap polyester shirts.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one knows how many wealthy dalit entrepreneurs have emerged since \nIndia opened its economy in the early 1990s, sparking some of the \nworld's fastest economic growth. Hundreds certainly, maybe thousands.\u0014\n\u0014\nVisibility grows\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are also increasingly visible. A decade ago, dalit businessmen \nregularly changed their last names, since these almost always \nidentify someone's caste. Even Pippal did it at first, playing off \nthe pronunciation of his name and calling his first company \"People's \nExports\" to mask his caste background.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, the dalit rich are chatting over cocktails at meetings of their \nown chamber of commerce, and setting up booths at dalit trade fairs. \nTop government officials are talking about a venture capital fund to \nmake financing more easily available to entrepreneurs from India's \noutcast communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wealthiest, meanwhile, have become darlings of the Indian media, \nheld up as proof that modern India is an increasingly caste-blind \nsociety.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonsense, says Anand Teltumbde, a prominent dalit activist.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These stories (about successful dalits) sit well with the middle \nclass,\" said Teltumbde, who is a grandson of B.R. Ambedkar, an \nindependence-era dalit lawyer revered as a hero by dalits across \nIndia. \"The entire world has changed ... but the number of well-off \ndalits is no more than 10 percent. Ninety percent of dalits live a \ndilapidated kind of life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Pippal, he finds himself uncomfortably in the middle of this \ndebate. He is a rich dalit who thinks very little has changed for \nIndia's outcasts, a man who credits his own success to hard work and \none enormous advantage: ego.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"From my childhood, I was thinking one day I will be a big man,\" he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaised in poverty, he only made it through high school before his \nfather became ill, and he had to go to work pulling a rickshaw to \nsupport the family. His first break came when he married a dalit \nwoman from a slightly better-off family that owned a small shoe \nworkshop.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDalits have long dominated the shoe business. Caste is largely a \nreflection of traditional trades, and since making shoes involved \nworking with the skins of dead animals, it was left to dalits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding on a skill\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Pippal shifted the focus of his father-in-law's workshop, \nconcentrating on high-quality shoes and teaching himself a slew of \nlanguages  English, Tamil, Punjabi, Russian, German  to sell his \nfootwear more widely. Today, he owns a 300-worker factory where 500 \nhandmade shoes are turned out every day, then packed into boxes \nalready marked with prices in euros and British pounds. The expensive \nones retail for as much as $500 a pair.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe used his footwear profits to start the small Honda dealership, and \nthen the hospital. Immense profits are being made in India's private \nhealth care industry, as the new middle class seeks alternatives to \nthe often-questionable care at most public hospitals.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I didn't know ABC about hospitals,\" Pippal said, laughing his \nbarking laugh. He gleefully talks about the Brahmin doctors who at \nfirst worked for him very reluctantly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Now they are earning a lot of money from this hospital,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, so is Pippal. He's still a long way from being a \nbillionaire, but says his businesses have a total turnover of about \n$12 million a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first glance, Heritage Hospital doesn't look state-of-the-art. \nPippal's office has stained green carpeting and paint coming away in \nbubbly clumps. On a recent day, masons were working near the main \nentrance, forcing patients to enter through a dark hallway beneath \nhis Honda dealership, which is next door. Janitors do little but move \naround the dirt with wet rags.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is cleaner and has more resources than the public hospitals \nmost Indians must rely upon. Pippal proudly ticks off its assets: 150 \nbeds, 187 doctors, a range of care from oncology to plastic surgery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn so many ways, Pippal has proven himself a success. He is rich. He \nis greeted with respect on the streets. His children went to good \nschools, and grew up with friends from across the caste spectrum.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet he also believes that he remains, very often, a figure of quiet \ncontempt.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These people are very bloody clever,\" Pippal said of the high-caste \nbusinessmen with whom he deals. \"When there are profits to be made, \nthen everything (about his caste) is OK.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But in their mind, they're thinking: 'He is a dalit.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

    "title": "R.J. THOMAS' DEADLY MISSION TO KOREA",
    "words": "September 13, 1865 \u0014\nR. J. Thomas' Deadly Mission in Korea\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert J. Thomas was haunted by the thought of Korea. A Welsh \nmissionary to China, he knew that the people of the \"Hermit Kingdom\" \nneeded the gospel. But Korea, observing how westerners had mistreated \nChina, closed its doors to foreigners. Burning with evangelistic \nzeal, Robert felt he must do something about the people's ignorance \nof eternal life. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, September 13, 1865, he arrived on the coast of Korea and \nbegan to learn what he could about the people and their language. By \nhis action, Robert became the first Protestant missionary to the \nancient land, whose name means \"chosen.\" Roman Catholics, however, \nhad converted many Koreans starting in the late 1700s. They were so \nsuccessful that in 1863 eight thousand were slaughtered by a \ngovernment that feared foreign influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLacking Korean language material, Robert handed out tracts and New \nTestaments in Chinese. He soon had to return to China, where, the \nfollowing year, his wife died.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1866, Robert learned that an American boat, the General Sherman, \nwas going to try to establish trade relations between Korea and the \nUnited States. He offered to accompany the boat as an interpreter in \nexchange for a chance to spread the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat August, the General Sherman sailed up the Taedong River toward \nPyongyang. Robert tossed gospel tracts onto the river bank as the \nship proceeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nKorean officials ordered the American boat to leave at once. The \nAmericans defied the warning. They paid for their arrogance with \ntheir lives. The schooner ran aground and stuck fast in the muddy \nbottom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Governor of the province, Pak Kyu Su, attacked the ship. When the \nKoreans tried to board, waving machetes, the Americans opened fire. \nOver the next two weeks, the Americans held the Koreans off, killing \ntwenty and wounding many more. By September 3, the Koreans were fed \nup. They launched a burning boat down river at the General Sherman to \nset it afire. Now the Americans had to dash ashore or burn to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the sailors fled from the boat, the Koreans killed them. Robert \nhad to flee with the rest. True to his mission, he leaped from the \nboat carrying a Bible. \"Jesus, Jesus!\" he cried in Korean to the \nattackers, offering them the Bible. His head was whacked off with a \nstroke of a machete according to one account, but others think he \npleaded for his life and was beaten to death. We may never know the \ntruth, nor if Robert tried to prevent the Sherman's foolish defiance \nof a sovereign power and its butchery of civilians. Seemingly \nRobert's efforts had been in vain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut God worked in the heart of the man who killed Robert. Convinced \nby Robert's beaming face that he had killed a good man, he kept one \nof the Bibles, wallpapering his house with it. People came from far \nand near to read its words. A church grew. A nephew of Robert's \nkiller became a pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday 40% of South Koreans are Christians and the nation has some of \nthe largest congregations in the world but the North remains largely \nclosed to the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBelke, Thomas J. \"Juche: A Christian Study of North Korea's State \nReligion.\" http://www.kimsoft.com/2000/jucheNK.htm\u0014\nKim, Young S. \"Corea's 1866 Clash With General Sherman\" \nhttp://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/ \narticle_view.asp?no=240389&rel_no=1 (this claims the story of Thomas \nYoung is largely mythical).\u0014\nPaek, Nak-chun.

    "title": "ROME FELL BUT A CHRISTIAN CLASSIC AROSE",
    "words": "August 24, 410 \u0014\nRome Fell but a Christian Classic Arose\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, August 24, 410, the city of Rome, once master of the \nMediterranean, fell to Alaric and his Visigoth armies. Someone opened \nthe city gate from within. The Medieval historian Procopius says this \nmay have been done by slaves that Alaric had treacherously given as a \ntoken of friendship to the Senators or by the servants of an \naristocratic woman who felt the city had suffered long enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, refugees showed up all around the Mediterranean world. In \nPalestine, Bible translator Jerome described formerly haughty women \nwho would now be happy to work for a crust of bread. He wrote letters \nlamenting the fall of the imperial city. Like everyone else, he could \nnot avoid the symbolism of the event. \"My voice sticks in my throat; \nand, as I dictate, sobs choke my utterance. The city which had taken \nthe whole world was itself taken...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sack of Rome, Christians died alongside pagans. Some Christian \nwomen suffered rape, although the Visigoths claimed to be Christians, \ntoo. Some of these women, following the historical example of the \nfamous pagan girl, Lucretia, killed themselves for shame. Others fled \nto North Africa as refugees, where they were taunted by pagans, who \nasked them why their God did not protect them or else accused them of \ncowardice for not killing themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy had Christians suffered in the taking of Rome? According to the \nBible, God would have spared Sodom if there had been just ten \nrighteous souls in it. Yet here was a city with thousands of \nChristians--a major church center, too--and yet God allowed it to be \nravaged. Pagans blamed Christian pacifists.\u0014\n\u0014\nVarious people put this question to the greatest living Christian \nthinker of the day. Augustine of Hippo responded by writing a \nmasterpiece, The City of God and the City of Man. This was the \nworld's first \"modern\" history in the sense that it offered an \naccount of world history with a teleological explanation--that is, an \nexplanation showing that events have \"purpose,\" or destination.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine took a different approach than Jerome. Giving a Christian \ninterpretation to the events, he pointed out that the barbarian \ninvaders had spared most of the churches and that even pagans had \ntaken refuge in the Christian churches. Christians had always \nsuffered and would always suffer, in this world, he noted. To phrase \nit in modern cliche, God had never promised the Christian a bed of \nroses.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Augustine's way of thinking, the fall of Rome was less important \nthan it seemed to most of his contemporaries. What was really going \non was a far deeper warfare--the war between God's kingdom and man's; \nif God's kingdom was not clearly distinguishable in this world, it is \nbecause not everyone who says they are a Christian really is. To the \nheathen who blamed Christianity for the downfall of the Roman Empire, \nAugustine showed that pagan practices actually were at fault for the \nweakness of the empire. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn book Two, Chapter four, Augustine asked, \"...Why were the gods so \nnegligent as to allow the morals of their worshippers to sink to so \nlow a depth?...why did not those gods...lay down moral precepts that \nwould help their devotees to lead a decent life?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn chapter twenty-one of the same book he notes: \"However great and \ngood your natural gifts may be, it takes true piety to make them pure \nand perfect; with impurity they merely end in loss and pain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine's long and loosely argued book was finished years after the \nsack of Rome. Alaric himself had died before it was done. It colored \nall later historical writing. That much good, at least, came out of \nAlaric's sack of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine. The City of God. Edited with an introduction by Vernon J. \nBourke.

    "title": "REMAINS OF HIPPOLYTUS",
    "words": "August 13, 236 \u0014\nRemains of Hippolytus\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe believers from the City of Rome were solemn. Under persecution, \nmany Christians had been killed at various times. \"Witnesses,\" they \ncalled these martyrs. The bodies of two witnesses who died in exile \nhad come home on this day, August 13, 236.*\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Maximinus Thrax was Roman emperor, he exiled Pontianus and \nHippolytus to the island of Sardinia where they probably slaved in \nthe mines. There they died, but now their remains had been brought \nback for a decent burial. Pontianus, who had been Bishop of Rome \nuntil his exile, was laid in the tomb of Callistus, an earlier Bishop \nof Rome (they would come to be known as popes, from the Italian for \n\"father\"). Hippolytus, who had also been a bishop in or near Rome, \nwas buried somewhere along the Tiburtine Road.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the two, Hippolytus' story is more interesting because we know \nnext to nothing about Pontianus. Hippolytus was the most important \ntheologian of the Roman Church up to that time, although his work was \nshelved for centuries afterward because it was written in Greek which \nthe people of the West forgot how to read. One of his books was \nagainst heresy. In it he explained what the Gnostics (who believed \nthey were saved by secret knowledge) and other groups taught and \nshowed where they went wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis would be enough to make Hippolytus worth remembering. But above \nall that, his case is often cited in arguments regarding the \nauthority of the Roman Church and its claim that popes are infallible \nwhen speaking ex cathedra.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo begin with, Hippolytus was a \"great-grandson\" of St. John the \nApostle. That is, we can trace his line of apostolic succession \ndirectly to John. He was commissioned by St. Irenaeus, who was \ncommissioned by Polycarp, who was commissioned by (or at least \npersonally knew) St. John himself. So there can be no question about \nhis legitimacy as a bishop.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the fourth century on, the Roman Church venerated Hippolytus as \na saint. Even popes have acknowledged him as a saint. Yet he was also \nthe first antipope (one \"illegally\" elected at the same time).\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could this be? Hippolytus spoke out strongly against the \nwrongdoing, cruelty and doctrinal errors of the bishops of Rome. This \nstruck a responsive chord with the Roman population, who elected him \nBishop of Rome in opposition to Bishop Callistus. Hippolytus \ncontinued in opposition to the bishops of Rome until he went into \nexile. While in exile, there are indications that he was reconciled \nwith Pontianus. \u0014\n\u0014\nHippolytus was an expert on heresy. The fact that he insisted that \nsome of the popes of his day were heretics was a strong reason that \nmany scholars could not agree when the Vatican Council declared the \npopes infallible in 1870.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sixteenth century, workmen digging near an ancient church on \nthe Tiburtine Road uncovered a marble statue. This was of a bishop \nseated in a chair, wearing a pallium (a cloth that symbolizes full \nepiscopal authority). Pope Pius IV declared it to be Saint \nHippolytus. Carved on the back of the chair were a list of \nHippolytus' writings.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Although the day seems fairly secure, the year is open to question.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "Rick Reilly on Tim Tebow\u0014\n\u0014\nI've come to believe in Tim Tebow, but not for what he does on a \nfootball field, which is still three parts Dr. Jekyll and two parts \nMr. Hyde.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, I've come to believe in Tim Tebow for what he does off a football \nfield, which is represent the best parts of us, the parts I want to \nbe and so rarely am.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho among us is this selfless?\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery week, Tebow picks out someone who is suffering, or who is \ndying, or who is injured, flies them and their families to the \nBroncos game, rents them a car, puts them up in a nice hotel, buys \nthem dinner (usually at a Dave and Buster's), gets them and their \nfamilies pregame passes, visits with them just before kickoff (!), \ngets them 30-yard line tickets down low, visits with them after the \ngame (sometimes for an hour), has them walk him to his car, and sends \nthem off with a basket of gifts.\u0014\n\u0014\nHome or road, win or lose, hero or goat.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember last week, when the world was pulling its hair out in the \nhour after Tebow had stunned the Pittsburgh Steelers with an 80-yard \nTO touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas in the playoffs? And Twitter \nwas exploding with 9,420 tweets about Tebow per second? When an ESPN \npoll was naming him the most popular athlete in America ?\u0014\n\u0014\nTebow was spending that hour talking to 16-year-old Bailey Knaub \nabout her 73 surgeries so far and what TV shows she likes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Here he'd just played the game of his life,\" recalls Bailey's \nmother, Kathy, of Loveland , Colo. , \"and the first thing he does \nafter his press conference is come find Bailey and ask, 'Did you get \nanything to eat?' He acted like what he'd just done wasn't anything, \nlike it was all about Bailey.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than that, Tebow kept corralling people into the room for Bailey \nto meet. Hey, Demaryius, come in here a minute. Hey, Mr. Elway. Hey, \nCoach Fox.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though sometimes-fatal Wegener's granulomatosis has left Bailey \nwith only one lung, the attention took her breath away.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was the best day of my life,\" she emailed. \"It was a bright star \namong very gloomy and difficult days. Tim Tebow gave me the greatest \ngift I could ever imagine. He gave me the strength for the future. I \nknow now that I can face any obstacle placed in front of me. Tim \ntaught me to never give up because at the end of the day, today might \nseem bleak but it can't rain forever and tomorrow is a new day, with \nnew promises.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI read that email to Tebow and he was honestly floored.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why me? Why should I inspire her?\" he said. \"I just don't feel, I \ndon't know, adequate. Really, hearing her story inspires me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not just NFL defenses that get Tebowed. It's kids who will die \nsoon. It's adults who can hardly stand. It's high school girls who \ndon't know if they'll ever go to a prom.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the game at Buffalo , it was Charlottesville , Va. , blue-chip \nhigh school QB Jacob Rainey, who lost his leg after a freak tackle in \na scrimmage. Tebow threw three interceptions in that Buffalo game and \nthe Broncos were crushed, 40-14.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He walked in and took a big sigh and said, 'Well, that didn't go as \nplanned,'\" remembers Rainey. \"Where I'm from, people wonder how \nsincere and genuine he is. But I think he's the most genuine person \nI've ever met.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's not an ounce of artifice or phoniness or Hollywood in this \nkid Tebow and I've looked everywhere for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake 9-year-old Zac Taylor, a child who lives in constant pain. \nImmediately after Tebow shocked the Chicago Bears with a 13-10 \ncomeback win, Tebow spent an hour with Zac and his family. At one \npoint, Zac, who has 10 doctors, asked Tebow if he has a secret prayer \nfor hospital visits. Tebow whispered it in his ear. And since Tebow \nstill needed to be checked out by the Broncos' team doctor, he took \nZac in with him, but only after they'd whispered it together.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it's not always kids. Tom Driscoll, a 55-year-old who is dying of \nbrain cancer at a hospice in Denver , was Tebow's guest for the \nCincinnati game. \"The doctors took some of my brain,\" Driscoll says, \n\"so my short-term memory is kind of shot. But that day I'll never \nforget. Tim is such a good man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis whole thing makes no football sense, of course. Most NFL players \nhardly talk to teammates before a game, much less visit with the sick \nand dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsn't that a huge distraction?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just the opposite,\" Tebow says. \"It's by far the best thing I do to \nget myself ready. Here you are, about to play a game that the world \nsays is the most important thing in the world. Win and they praise \nyou. Lose and they crush you. And here I have a chance to talk to the \ncoolest, most courageous people. It puts it all into perspective. The \ngame doesn't really matter. I mean, I'll give 100 percent of my heart \nto win it, but in the end, the thing I most want to do is not win \nchampionships or make a lot of money, it's to invest in people's \nlives, to make a difference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that's it. I've given up giving up on him. I'm a 100 percent \nbeliever. Not in his arm. Not in his skills. I believe in his heart, \nhis there-will-definitely-be-a-pony-under-the-tree optimism, the way \nhis love pours into people, right up to their eyeballs, until they \nbelieve they can master the hopeless comeback, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember the QB who lost his leg, Jacob Rainey? He got his prosthetic \nleg a few weeks ago and he wants to play high school football next \nseason. Yes, tackle football. He'd be the first to do that on an \nabove-the-knee amputation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHmmm. Wonder where he got that crazy idea?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Tim told me to keep fighting, no matter what,\" Rainey says. \"I am.\"\u0014",

    "title": "RIFT FORMS IN MOVEMENT ON BELIEF IN \"GAY CURE\"",
    "words": "Rift Forms in Movement as Belief in Gay Cure Is Renounced\u0014\n\u0014\nWeve been asking people with same-sex attractions to overcome \nsomething in a way that we dont ask of anyone else, said Alan \nChambers, president of Exodus International. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy ERIK ECKHOLM\u0014\nPublished: July 6, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than three decades, Exodus International has been the \nleading force in the so-called ex-gay movement, which holds that \nhomosexuals can be cured through Christian prayer and \npsychotherapy. \u0014\n\u0014\nExodus leaders claimed its network of ministries had helped tens of \nthousands rid themselves of unwanted homosexual urges. The notion \nthat homosexuality is not inborn but a choice was seized on by \nconservative Christian groups who oppose legal protections for gay \nmen and lesbians and same-sex marriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the ex-gay movement has been convulsed as the leader of Exodus, \nin a series of public statements and a speech to the groups annual \nmeeting last week, renounced some of the movements core beliefs. \nAlan Chambers, 40, the president, declared that there was no cure for \nhomosexuality and that reparative therapy offered false hopes to \ngays and could even be harmful. His statements have led to charges of \nheresy and a growing schism within the network. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor the last 37 years, Exodus has been a bright light, arguably the \nbrightest one for those with same-sex attraction seeking an \nauthentically Christian hope, said Andrew Comiskey, founder and \ndirector of Desert Stream Ministries, based in Kansas City, Mo., one \nof 11 ministries that defected. His group left Exodus in May, Mr. \nComiskey said in an e-mail, due to leader Alan Chamberss \nappeasement of practicing homosexuals who claim to be Christian as \nwell as his questioning of the reality of sexual orientation \nchange. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a phone interview Thursday from Orlando, Fla., where Exodus has \nits headquarters, Mr. Chambers amplified on the views that have \nstirred so much controversy. He said that virtually every ex-gay he \nhas ever met still harbors homosexual cravings, himself included. Mr. \nChambers, who left the gay life to marry and have two children, said \nthat gay Christians like himself faced a lifelong spiritual struggle \nto avoid sin and should not be afraid to admit it. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe said Exodus could no longer condone reparative therapy, which \nblames homosexuality on emotional scars in childhood and claims to \nreshape the psyche. And in a theological departure that has caused \nthe sharpest reaction from conservative pastors, Mr. Chambers said he \nbelieved that those who persist in homosexual behavior could still be \nsaved by Christ and go to heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly a few years ago, Mr. Chambers was featured in advertisements \nalong with his wife, Leslie, saying, Change is possible. But now, \nhe said in the interview, Exodus needs to move beyond that slogan. \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that any sexual expression outside of heterosexual, \nmonogamous marriage is sinful according to the Bible, Mr. Chambers \nemphasized. But weve been asking people with same-sex attractions \nto overcome something in a way that we dont ask of anyone else, he \nsaid, noting that Christians with other sins, whether heterosexual \nlust, pornography, pride or gluttony, do not receive the same blanket \ncondemnations. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Chamberss comments come at a time of widening acceptance of \nhomosexuality and denunciation of reparative therapy by professional \nsocieties that say it is based on faulty science and potentially \nharmful. \u0014\n\u0014\nA bill to outlaw conversion therapy for minors has passed the \nCalifornia Senate and is now before the State Assembly. Earlier this \nyear, a prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, apologized for \npublishing what he now calls an invalid study, which said many \npatients had largely or totally switched their sexual orientation. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefenders of the therapy say that it can bring deep changes in sexual \norientation and that the attacks are politically motivated. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid H. Pickup, a therapist in Glendale, Calif., who specializes in \nthe treatment, said restricting it would harm people who are unhappy \nwith their homosexuality by making them feel that no change is \npossible at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Pickup, an officer of the National Association for Research and \nTherapy of Homosexuality, composed of like-minded therapists, said \nreparative therapy had achieved profound changes for thousands of \npeople, including himself. The therapy, he said, had helped him \nconfront emotional wounds and my homosexual feelings began to \ndissipate and attractions for women grew. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome in the ex-gay world are more scathing about Mr. Chambers. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think Mr. Chambers is tired of his own personal struggles, so hes \nmaking excuses for them by making sweeping generalizations about \nothers, said Gregg Quinlan, a conservative lobbyist in New Jersey \nand president of a support group called Parents and Friends of \nEx-Gays & Gays. \u0014\n\u0014\nExodus International, with a budget of $1.5 million provided by \ndonors and member churches, is on a stable footing, Mr. Chambers \nsaid. He said the shifts in theology had the support of the Exodus \nboard and had been welcomed by many of the 150 churches that are \nmembers in North America, which increasingly have homosexuals in \ntheir congregations. More opposition has come from affiliated \nministries specifically devoted to sex-related therapies, with 11 \nquitting Exodus so far while about 70 remain. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn another sign of change, the vice chairman of the Exodus board, \nDennis Jernigan, was forced to resign in June after he supported \nanti-sodomy laws in Jamaica. The board pledged to fight efforts \nanywhere to criminalize sexual acts between consenting adults. \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Gagnon, an associate professor at the Pittsburgh Theological \nSeminary and author of books on homosexuality and the Bible, last \nweek issued a public call for Mr. Chambers to resign. My greatest \nconcern has to do with Alans repeated assurances to homosexually \nactive gay Christians that they will be with him in heaven, he \nsaid in an e-mail. \u0014\n\u0014\nGay rights advocates said they were encouraged by Mr. Chamberss \nrecent turn but remained wary of Exodus, which they feel has caused \nenormous harm. \u0014\n\u0014\nExodus International played the key role in planting the message \nthat people can go from gay to straight through religion and \ntherapy, said Wayne Besen, director of Truth Wins Out, a group that \nrefutes what it considers misinformation about gays and lesbians. \nAnd the notion that one can change is the centerpiece of the \nreligious rights argument for denying us rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the local ministries in Exodus continue to attack gays and \nlesbians, said David Roberts, editor of the Web site Ex-Gay Watch, \nand they often have close ties with reparative therapists. He \nspeculated that Mr. Chambers was trying to steer the group in a \nmoderate direction because they were becoming pariahs in a society \nthat is more accepting of gay people. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Chambers said he was simply trying to restore Exodus to its \noriginal purpose when it was founded in 1976: providing spiritual \nsupport for Christians who are struggling with homosexual attraction. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe said that he was happy in his marriage, with a love and devotion \nmuch deeper than anything I experienced in gay life, but that he \nknew this was not feasible for everyone. Many Christians with \nhomosexual urges may have to strive for lives of celibacy. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut those who fail should not be severely judged, he said, adding, \nWe all struggle or fall in some way.\u0014",

Unknown workers -- backed by police and civil \nvolunteers -- began tearing down Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church soon \nafter midnight on Sept. 6, and by morning almost the entire \nthree-story building had been destroyed. According to human rights \ngroups, the Holy Trinity congregation had tried to meet the city's \nlegal requirements, but \"there was a court decision that we cannot \nuse the building anymore, and it does not belong to us any longer,\" a \nchurch member\\explained. \"They came at night to avoid conflict with \npeople. ...

    "title": "REALITIES ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE PEW",
    "words": "In an article for ChurchLeaders.com, Richard Chancy points out six \nrealities about the people in the pews that may be overlooked by too \nmany preachers. Among them: \u0014\n\u0014\nWe're In Debt. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 40 percent of U.S. families spend more than they earn. \nAmericans carry, on average, $8,400 in credit card debt. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe solution to this problem isn't talking less about moneyit's \ntalking more about how freedom feels when you treat your money the \nway God instructed us. If you teach on this with our best interest in \nmind, you can't lose. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe Hate Our Jobs. \u0014\n\u0014\nEmployee surveys show that more than 65 percent of workers are not \nsatisfied with their job. \u0014\nThese numbers are consistent over a wide variety of professions, and \nthe studies were performed with massive amounts of people to validate \nthe results. Most people don't ever get the opportunity to know their \nwork changed eternity for someone. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe Have Tension. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhether we're a school teacher or a CEO, we come to work day in day \nout with an objective in mind we have to accomplish or our job is at \nrisk. The tension is always there, and we've learned to live with it, \nmaybe even forget it's there from time to time. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, make no mistake, we are all in performance-based jobs. Fail \nto perform at the minimum required level, and someone else is waiting \nto fill our spot. That's what many of us do, perform at the minimum \nacceptable level to keep from losing our jobs. There is no passion! \u0014\n\u0014\nWe Pay Taxes. \u0014\n\u0014\nBetween state and federal income tax, as well as property taxes, the \neffective tax rate for middle America is somewhere between 11.5 \npercent and 15 percent. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason I mention this is, with the deductions clergy receive for \nmortgage interest expense, along with being able to receive a \nsignificant portion of your salary in the form of a housing expense, \na pastor's income of $85,000 looks a lot different from that same \nsalary for one of your members. I think that's an important \ndistinction to make when you compare your giving as a pastor to their \ngiving as members. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of us don't give many people permission to speak into our lives, \nbut we've given it to you. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou have a unique opportunity to be used by God to inspire us to \nhave: \u0014\n\u0014\n Better marriages \u0014\n Be more generous (and pay less taxes)\"Generosity is the cure for \nmaterialism.\" \u0014\n Make our work about reaching people, which will skyrocket our job \nsatisfaction \u0014\n Treat our bodies as God's temple \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we're showing up to your church, we're giving you permission to \ninfluence change in our lives. What will you do with it?\u0014",

    "title": "RAPE AND MURDER IN INDIA",
    "words": "Indias women\u0014\nRape and murder in Delhi\u0014\n\u0014\nA horrible attack could prove a turning point for Indias women\u0014\n\u0014\nJan 5th 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nWHAT stirred so many Indians to rise up and demonstrate at the \nmurderous gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi on a \nmid-December evening? Not just the fact of the crime: in India rape \nhas long been depressingly common. Nor just outrage at her fatal \ninternal injuries, inflicted by an iron bar allegedly wielded by the \nsix men charged with the attack: Indian women are far too vulnerable \nto violent assaults. The reason people took to the streets is that a \ngrowing middle class is uniting to make its voice heard. The hope is \nthat their protests will at last mark an advance for Indias \nbeleaguered women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe UNs human-rights chief calls rape in India a national problem. \nRapes and the ensuing deaths (often from suicide), are routinely \ndescribed in Indias pressthough many more attacks go unreported to \nthe public or police. Delhi has a miserable but deserved reputation \nfor being unsafe, especially for poor and low-caste women. Sexual \nviolence in villages, though little reported, keeps girls and women \nindoors after dark. As young men migrate from the country into huge, \ncrowded slums, their predation goes unchecked. Prosecution rates for \nrape are dismally low and convictions lower stillas in many \ncountries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndian women also have much else to be gloomy about, especially if \nthey live in the north. Studies and statistics abound, but India is \ngenerally at or near the bottom of the heap of womens misery. A UN \nindex in 2011 amalgamated details on female education and employment, \nwomen in politics, sexual and maternal health and more. It ranked \nIndia 134th out of 187 countries, worse than Saudi Arabia, Iraq or \nChina. Indias 2011 census confirmed an increasingly distorted sex \nratio among newborn babies in many states, as parents use ultrasound \nscanners to identify the sex of fetuses and then abort female ones. \nIndia is missing millions of unborn girls. Discrimination continues \nthroughout life. Boys in villages are typically fed better than girls \nand are more likely to get an education. Women are routinely groped \nand harassed by men on buses and trains. Many Indian brides still pay \ndowries. The misery of daughters-in-law abused after moving in with \ntheir husbands extended families is a staple of crime reports and \nsoap operas.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid this sea of misery, the anonymous medical students fate stood \nout chiefly because she was representative of Indias emerging middle \nclass. A student of physiotherapy, she was attacked going home from \nan early-evening cinema screening of Life of Pi. She was with a \nmale friend, a young engineer. As someone doing what people like her \ndo across the world every night of the week, she was the friend, \nsister or daughter of an entire social group. As in the campaign \nagainst corruption during the past few years, the protesters fury \nwas fanned by non-stop television and press coverage. The street \nprotests were so intense that worried officials resorted to tear gas \nand curfew-like restrictions in parts of Delhi.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe strength of their reaction means that something good may yet come \nfrom this crime. There is no reason to think that India is destined \nto abuse women. Its biggest religion, Hinduism, is relatively \ntolerant towards them. India already has a liberal constitution and a \nhost of progressive laws, for example against sex-selective abortion \nand against dowries. The country has role models: a decent crop of \nhigh-ranking women politicians, civil servants, judges and \njournalists.\u0014\n\u0014\nTime is on their side\u0014\n\u0014\nAs India shifts from being a poor, mostly rural place to an urban, \nwealthier and modern one, more women will study, take paid jobs and \ndecide for themselves whom to marry or divorce and where to live. \nAlready, many of the growing band of educated, connected and active \nIndians are infuriated by the failure of politicians to look after \nthem. They deplore venal party politics. They will increasingly \ndemand that politicians deal with the things that matter to them. The \nscandal could thus prove a first step on the road to getting the \npolice to take rape seriously and to enforcing the laws protecting \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the journey will be a long one. Violence against women tends to \nreflect how they are treated across society. Attitudes, therefore, \nmatter. Indias film and music industries, for example, should stop \ndepicting men who assault women as macho heroes. The press should \ndrop the use of coy phrases such as Eve-teasing when it really \nmeans sexual harassment. Those who witness men groping women could \nconfront them. The families of victims of sexual crime should dwell \nless on the shame they feel they have incurred and more on how to \nprosecute offenders. The pity is that to change attitudes to rape so \nmany young women have had to suffer and die.\u0014",

    "title": "ROE AT 40? WHO'S WINNING THE ABORTION BATTLE?",
    "words": "Roe at 40: Who's Winning the Abortion Battle?\u0014\n\u0014\nWith victories and setbacks on both sides, not to mention conflicting \npolls, it can be hard to tell. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Gibson, Religion News Service \u0014\n\u0014\n[ posted 1/18/2013 Christianity Today)\u0014\n\u0014\nFour decades after Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling \nthat legalized abortion, many opponents of the decision are in a \ncelebratory mood while those backing abortion rights are glum, \nfeeling that momentum is turning decisively against them.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet in reality, little has changed in the fiercest and most \nprotracted battle of the nation's bitter culture war.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, what's really going on is a case study in the psychology of \nmovement politics, where activists have to rally supporters with \ncries of alarm without making them despair that all is lost. At the \nsame time, they must offer evidence that their efforts are paying off \nwithout leaving them complacent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a difficult balancing act, and lately the abortion rights camp \nhas been the one to sound the warnings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As memories of women dying from illegal pre-Roe abortions become \nmore distant, the pro-choice cause is in crisis,\" Kate Pickert wrote \nin a bleakfor Roe supportersand eye-catching Time magazine cover \nessay this month.\u0014\n\u0014\nPickert pointed to the growing number of state-level actions to \nrestrict access to abortion servicesthe Guttmacher Institute's \nannual review found that in 2012 there were 43 such provisions in 19 \nstate lawsand the decrease in abortion providers nationwide, from \n2,908 in 1982 to 1,793 in 2008.\u0014\n\u0014\nPregnancy centers run by conservative Christians as alternatives to \nabortion clinics have been proliferating as well, and there have been \nconcertedand often successfulefforts to cut or bar government \nfunding of Planned Parenthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, the abortion rights movement is facing a generational \ndivide, as younger women try to take the reins from aging leaders who \nthey see as tone deaf to the public's more nuanced views on abortion. \nIndeed, the \"pro-choice\" label is losing its luster while a growing \nnumber of young people like to identify themselves as \"pro-life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNot surprisingly, some abortion opponents who have toiled for decades \nto achieve a breakthrough have been exchanging high fives over the \nabortion-rights angst.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Of course Time magazine is right. It is axiomatic, it is the story \nof our times, it is the thing every pro-lifer knows: We're winning \nthis battle,\" Tom Hoopes, a professor of communications at \nBenedictine College in Atchison, Kansas, wrote at the blog of \nCatholicVote.org.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch confidence is oxygen for any movement, and understandable after \nsuch a long standoff. But it may also greatly overstate the current \ndynamics of the abortion battle.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, surveys show that public opinion on abortion rights has \nbarely budged in years, as a slight majority of Americans \nconsistently want to keep abortion legal in most or all cases while \nabout 40 percent would like to see abortion outlawed in most or all \ncases. According to the latest research from the Pew Forum on \nReligion & Public Life, an even larger majority wants to keep the Roe \nv. Wade decision intact.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, so-called \"personhood amendments\" that seek to leapfrog Roe \nand ban all abortions by declaring that a fetus is a person from the \nmoment of conception have failed every time they have gone to the \nvoters, even in the most anti-abortion states in the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome abortion opponents also concede that the re-election of \nPresident Obama has likely preserved Roe v. Wade for another \ngeneration, since Obama may get to appoint one or more Supreme Court \njustices over the next four years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd many admit that the 2012 election changed the standard political \ncalculus on abortion. Rhetorical excesses by Republican candidates \nwho spoke about abortion and rape led top GOP leadersincluding \npresidential nominee Mitt Romneyto distance themselves from the \nremarks and even declare they would not seek to overturn Roe, a \nposition once considered anathema for any GOP hopeful.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, Democrats found that campaigning on a platform of \npreserving abortion rights and providing access to birth control was \na winner among the growing cohort of single women. That essentially \nshifted the polarity of the culture war so that Democrats were often \nrunning on those moral issues while Republicans ran away from them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, the backlash over the short-lived decision in early 2012 \nby the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation to cut funding to \nPlanned Parenthood demonstrated the depth of the public's support for \nwomen's health issues and signaled that the public may not be as \nsupportive of curbing reproductive rights as some may think. \n(Editor's note: CT ran pro-life reactions from Albert Mohler, Russell \nMoore, Matthew Lee Anderson, Mollie Ziegler Hemingway, and Karen \nHandel.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Pro-abortion activists are losing? Really? If you believe that, I've \ngot a bridge to sell you. Cheap,\" said Pia de Solenni, who wrote a \ncolumn at the National Catholic Register telling abortion foes not to \nbelieve the hype.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no convincing evidence that public attitudes are changing, \nshe said, and the abortion rights movement is \"a really aggressive \npossum playing dead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, in the days before the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe, a number \nof anti-abortion leaders sought to tamp down a sense of \noverconfidence in the ranks, fearing that it could lead to the same \nkind of complacency that has recently worried abortion rights \nactivists.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are a long way from a national consensus that could be reasonably \nand honestly described as pro-life,\" said R. Albert Mohler Jr., \npresident of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. \"Even reversing \nRoe v. Wade will not be enough.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStriking down Roe v. Wade could actually pose a daunting challenge, \naccording to abortion foes who note that the high court's decision \neffectively created their movement in one fell swoop while making the \nabortion rights movement part of the establishmentthereby \nguaranteeing that its backers would take their victory for granted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Many pro-life activists fervently pray for Roe's reversal,\" Jon A. \nShields, author of \"The Democratic Virtues of the Christian Right,\" \nwrites in the latest edition of First Things, a conservative opinion \njournal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yet Roe's reversal would hardly represent a decisive victory for the \npro-life movement. In fact, it would almost certainly revitalize a \ngenuine movement for abortion rights. Pro-lifers need not make peace \nwith Roe to recognize it has brought certain benefits.\"\u0014",

    "title": "ROSA PARKS REVISITED",
    "words": "Rosa Parks, Revisited\u0014\nBy CHARLES M. BLOW             New York Times      2/2/13\u0014\n \u0014\nMost of what you think you know about Rosa Parks may well be wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the verge of the 100th anniversary of her birth this Monday comes \na fascinating new book, The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks, by \nJeanne Theoharis, a Brooklyn College professor. It argues that the \nromanticized, childrens-book story of a meek seamstress with aching \nfeet who just happened into history in a moment of uncalculated \nresistance is pure mythology. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Theoharis points out, Rosas family sought to teach her a \ncontrolled anger, a survival strategy that balanced compliance with \nmilitancy. \u0014\n\u0014\nParks was mostly raised by her grandparents. Her grandfather, a \nfollower of Marcus Garvey, often sat vigil on the porch with a rifle \nin case the Klan came. She sometimes sat with him because, as the \nbook says she put it, I wanted to see him kill a Ku Kluxer. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she was a child, a young white man taunted her. In turn, she \nthreatened him with a brick. Her grandmother reprimanded her as too \nhigh-strung, warning that Rosa would be lynched before the age of \n20. Rosa responded, I would be lynched rather than be run over by \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most troubling and possibly most controversial scenes in \nthe book occurs when Rosa is a young woman working as a domestic. A \nwhite man whom she calls Mr. Charlie tries to sexually assault her. \nDetermined to protect herself, she taunts him as she evades him, \nharanguing him about the white mans inhuman treatment of the \nNegro. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow I hated all white people, especially him, she continued. I \nsaid I would never stoop so low as to have anything to do with him. \u0014\n\u0014\nParks added that if he wanted to kill me and rape a dead body, he \nwas welcome but he would have to kill me first. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe author points out that although the story is recorded in Parkss \nown handwriting, it isnt clear whether its completely true, half \ntrue or just allegory. \u0014\n\u0014\nRosa married Raymond Parks, a civil rights activist who sometimes \ncarried a gun and who impressed her because, she said, he refused to \nbe intimidated by white people. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe spent nearly two decades before the bus incident struggling, \norganizing and agitating for civil rights, mostly as the secretary of \nthe Montgomery, Ala., branch of the N.A.A.C.P. But it wasnt until \nParks was in her 40s and attended an integrated workshop that she \nfound for the first time in my adult life that this could be a \nunified society. This didnt mean that she was eager for \nintegration, though. She was later quoted as saying that what people \nsought was not a matter of close physical contact with whites, but \nequal opportunity. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Parks was by no means the first person to perform an act of civil \ndisobedience on a bus. She was very much aware of many of the people \nwhose similar actions had preceded her own, even raising money for \nsome of their defense funds. She also encouraged others to commit \nthese acts of civil disobedience. \u0014\n\u0014\nParks explained that I had felt for a long time, that if I was ever \ntold to get up so a white person could sit, that I would refuse to do \nso. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat day came on Dec. 1, 1955, when a bus driver asked her to get up \nso that a white man could sit. She refused. This was not a \nspur-of-the-moment decision. It was a political calculation informed \nby a life of activism. As Parks put it, an opportunity was being \ngiven to me to do what I had asked of others. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the idea that she stayed seated because of physical fatigue is \npure fiction. \u0014\n\u0014\nI didnt tell anyone my feet were hurting, the book quotes her as \nsaying. It was just popular, I suppose because they wanted to give \nsome excuse other than the fact that I didnt want to be pushed \naround. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book also lays out Parkss leading role in the bus boycotts and \nher decades of activism after the civil rights movement. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Parks died in 2005, Theoharis says, The Rosa Parks who surfaced \nin the deluge of public commentary was, in nearly every account, \ncharacterized as quiet. Humble, dignified, and soft-spoken, \nshe was not angry and never raised her voice.  \u0014\n\u0014\nParks, like many other Americans who over the years have angrily \nagitated for change in this country, had been sanitized and \nsugarcoated for easy consumption. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Theoharis writes: Held up as a national heroine but stripped of \nher lifelong history of activism and anger at American injustice, the \nParks who emerged was a self-sacrificing mother figure for a nation \nwho would use her death for a ritual of national redemption. \u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, this book seeks to restore Parkss wholeness, even at \nthe risk of stirring unease. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rosa Parks in this book is as much Malcolm X as she is Martin \nLuther King Jr.\u0014",

His height was a little above average for the time when he had \nlived. His limbs were regular and delicatealmost feminine, the \nscientists said. Pace Shakespeare, there was no withered arm. There \nwas, however, a severely sideways-twisted spine, the result of \nscoliosis that had probably emerged in adolescence. It would have put \none shoulder higher than the other, making him stand shorter than he \nwas. He might have needed extra cushions in his chairs, and extra \ntugs when putting on those robes of green velvet and crimson cloth of \ngold so lovingly detailed in his orders to the Wardrobe. But then a \nking would get that sort of help anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe body now identified as Richard (give or take the last layers of \nDNA testing) was found beneath the choir of the vanished Grey Friars, \nthe Franciscan priory in Leicester. An honourable place, but hardly \ngood enough for a king, and the work was done hastily: the grave dug \ntoo short for the body and the body itself crammed in without shroud \nor coffin, with its hands bound in front of its privates. The skull, \nwhen found, was open-mouthed, as if it still yelled Treason! \nTreason! When you lose a battle, as he had just lost Bosworth, on \nAugust 22nd 1485, to Henry Tudor, that is how you end. The body was \nbattered. The face, however, was kept intact, to show the people he \nwas dead. It has now been reconstructed: younger-looking than its 32 \nyears, smooth with fresh paint and plastic and, in an odd way, \ninnocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis supporters hope this new Richard can come to replace the old. \nTime to focus on the loyal brother, the brave soldier, the highly \ncompetent administrator of the north of England, the pounder of the \nScots; time to remember the man who brought in special courts to hear \nthe complaints of the poor, who abolished benevolences (taxes, \nunvoted by Parliament, disguised as gifts to the king) and who banned \nany curbs on the new art of printing. And time to bury deep the \naccused murderer of Henry VI, Henrys son Edward, George Duke of \nClarence, Lord Hastings and his own two pathetic nephews, the princes \nin the Tower: the crook-backed, leering, strawberry-fancying villain \nof Polydore Vergil, Thomas More, Shakespeare and Laurence Olivier, \ndragging his spider-body round and round the stage of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo a large degree, though, the man who was Richard III has already \nbeen uncovered. He has been found in his books, most of them \nsecond-hand and well-thumbed: The Guidance of Princes, Wycliffes \nNew Testament, The Art of War, stock romances. In these he wrote \nhis name and, sometimes, the motto tant le desiree, Ive wanted it \nso much. (The crown, perhaps?) On the calendar page of his book of \nhours he carefully wrote in his name, birthplace and birth-year \nagainst October 2nd, his birthday. This was a man who spent the \nChristmas of 1484 over-partying, and who liked to appear in a sea of \nsilk banners of his own device, the white boar; but who also had a \nparticular devotion to St Anthony the Hermit, patron of those who \nstruggled against the sins of the flesh. Compared with his \nhedonistic, amorous brother, Edward IV, there was a moral strictness, \nalmost prudishness, about Richard, much emphasised by him when in \n1483 he made his risky lunge for the throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe killer blow\u0014\n\u0014\nAll these human touches and virtues have been known for years, and \nyet the monster Richard survives. Favourite stories, centuries old, \nare very hard to shift. The Tudors, who blackened him to promote \nthemselves, laid it on thick. That is not the only problem, however. \nRichard was already, to some, a monster in his own time. For all his \nself-conferred title of Lord Protector, he had usurped the throne, \nand rumours were alive that he was a child-killer. That was why his \nreign could never properly get started, and why he was betrayed at \nBosworth a mere two years in.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe skeleton found in the car park gave vivid evidence of the \nstrength of feeling against him. Unhorsed in the mle, fighting like \nfury with his helmet off, he was killed either by a sword-thrust \nright through his brain, or by a halberd-blow that sliced off the \nback of his skull. More dagger blows to his head were inflicted once \nhe was dead, and as a parting shot a knife was plunged in his \nbuttocks as his naked body, slung over a saddle, was carried from the \nfield.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the mystery of how the loyal soldier of 1482 turned into the \ndesperate, secretive, conspiracy-haunted man of 1485 the bones have \nnothing to say. His childhood and youth were marked by civil war. In \n1470 he was forced, with his brother, into exile in the Low \nCountries. The age was one of ever-shifting loyalties and every man \nfor himself. He was physically hampered, that is now clear: if not \nenough to change his life, enough to hurt his pride and try his \ntemper. Those factors may explain something. Yet all the CT scans, \nenvironmental sampling and DNA analysis in the world cannot reveal \nwhether, when he kissed the small nephews whose guardian he \nostensibly was, he really meant it, or whether he was already \ncontemplating an order that would snuff them out.\u0014",

    "title": "REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CHURCH",
    "words": "\u0014\nThe impact of the nones. The 2012 study by Pew Research rightfully \ngarnered much attention. The percentage of the adult U. S. population \nthat claims no religious affiliation increased from 15 percent in \n2007 to 20 percent in 2012. That is an amazing 33 percent increase in \nthat one category in a relatively short period. One implication for \nlocal congregation is the decrease of marginal church attendees, \noften called CEO (Christmas Easter Only) Christians. There is no \nlonger much societal pressure to attend church. Those on the margins \nare thus falling off completely. There will continue to be a \nfinancial impact since these infrequent attendees typically provided \nsome level of giving to their churches. \u0014\n\u0014\nMigration back to small groups. For three decades, the key emphasis \nin American church life has been the corporate worship experience. \nThough that emphasis is not going away, there is an increasing \nemphasis on moving people to small groups of all kinds: Sunday \nschools; home groups; life groups; etc. There is an increasing \nawareness that those who are in groups have a higher level of \ncommitment in almost all areas of church life. As the Sunday school \nmovement swept the nation for a half-century through the 1970s, a \nsimilar groups movement is already underway and should gain even more \nmomentum. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccelerated closing of churches. The institutional church stubbornly \nresists formal closing. Even if only six or seven people attend each \nweek, those few fight for the survival of their church. Those who \nwere attending these very small churches are either moving to the \nnones category, or they are moving to larger churches. The primary \nstalwats to keep the doors open are members of the builder \ngeneration, those born before 1946. As that generation decreases at \nan increasing rate, more churches will close. Any guess to the number \nof closings in 2013 is speculation on my part. I wouldnt be \nsurprised, however, if the numbers reach the 8,000 to 10,000 level.\u0014\n \u0014\nMore churches moving to multiple venues. Membership in Mensa is not a \nrequisite to have an insight on this issue. Just from an anecdotal \nperspective, the number of congregations moving to multiple venues is \nstaggering. Indeed that issue may be the single greatest \ndistinguishing factor in growing churches. The variety of the venues \nis increasing as well. Some churches have different venues on the \nsame campus. Others move to multiple campus models. Some have an \nonsite preacher/teacher; others offer video streaming. Some churches \nhave venues on Sunday only. Other churches have venues up to seven \ndays a week. In the 1960s American congregations moved to multiple \nworship services in sweeping numbers. That same trend in multiple \nvenues is taking place today. It should accelerate.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe growth of prayer emphases in local congregations. Though prayer \nis foundational in the life of New Testament congregations, it \nfrankly has not garnered much attention in recent years in American \nchurches. There was a subtle but noticeable shift in 2012. More and \nmore church leaders and members realized that the power and strength \nof health in their congregations is not human-centered but \nGod-dependent. I am reticent to predict a true prayer revival in our \nnation, but I am confident in saying that more local congregations \nwill focus on prayer. It will be interesting to see how such an \nemphasis manifests itself in each local body.\u0014\n \u0014\nFickle commitment. In his post, Sam Rainer noted an overall decline \nin institutional loyalty. It is certainly pervasive in many American \ncongregations. Indeed, the culture of the vast majority of American \nchurches has been one of low commitment. That lower level of \ncommitment is evident, paradoxically, in even the more committed \nmembers. Those members who once were present every time the doors \nwere open may now be present, for example, 75 percent of the time. \nIt is likely that decreased frequency of active attendees may be the \nsingle largest contributor to church decline in the past five years.\u0014\n \u0014\nInnovative use of space. I recently drove onto a church property \nlocated on approximately three to four acres. My consultant training \ntold me that 300 to 500 people could worship on that site. The \nMillennial pastor who was riding with me said that the site could \neasily accommodate 2,000 in attendance. The younger pastor did not \nsee limitations of times or days of worship. Indeed that generation \nwill cause us to look anew at church space limitations.\u0014\n \u0014\nHeightened conflict. The Millennial generation will not accept \nchurch-as-usual. They are shaking the status quo in many churches. \nThey are not seeking to be adversarial; they are simply asking tough \nquestions that those of us in older generations were reticent to \naddress. Anecdotally the greatest resistance to change is occurring \nin the Builder generation and the older Boomer generation (roughly \nincluding those born before 1955).\u0014\n \u0014\nAdversarial government. More public schools and other public \nfacilities will be less accepting of churches meeting in their \nfacilities. Some other local governments are resisting approval of \nnon-tax paying congregations expanding their facilities. New churches \nand existing churches that are expanding their venues will be forced \nto become more creative as they look for new locations. \u0014\n\u0014\nCommunity focus. One of the great benefits the Millennial generation \nbrings to our churches is their focus on the community in which the \nchurch is located. They are not content simply to offer ministries to \nthose who come to the church facilities; they are going into the \ncommunity to serve the merchants and residents who work and live \nthere.\u0014\n \u0014\nCultural discomfort. Many of the issues noted thus far point to \ngrowing levels of discomfort for the congregations in the culture \nthey seek to minister and serve. For all of the twentieth century and \neven the early years of the twenty-first century, it was culturally \nacceptable, even expected, to be a part of a local congregation. \nThose expectations are all but gone. There is a growing and distinct \ndivide between the values of the culture and the Christian values \nmost churches hold.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrganizational distrust. There is a pervasive and growing distrust of \ninstitutions in general. Those institutions are found in both \ngovernment and business, but religious institutions are not exempt \nfrom this lack of trust. That diminishing confidence exudes from \nthose both in churches and those who do not attend churches.\u0014\n \u0014\nReductions in church staff. I am watching this development carefully. \nTwo different forces are at work. First, in many congregations there \nis a greater emphasis on laypersons handling roles once led by paid \nstaff. Second, the tough economic climate and declining church \nattendance are naturally affecting church budgets. Congregations are \nreticent to fire staff, but more and more are not filling vacant \npositions.\u0014",

    "title": "RABBI WHO CRIED TO JEWS OF BEUCHENWALD",
    "words": "March 26, 2013\u0014\nRabbi Who Cried to the Jews of Buchenwald: 'You Are Free'\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MARGALIT FOX\u0014\nThe smoke was still rising as Rabbi Herschel Schacter rode through \nthe gates of Buchenwald.\u0014\n \u0014\nIt was April 11, 1945, and Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army had \nliberated the concentration camp scarcely an hour before. Rabbi \nSchacter, who was attached to the Third Army's VIII Corps, was the \nfirst Jewish chaplain to enter in its wake. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat morning, after learning that Patton's forward tanks had arrived \nat the camp, Rabbi Schacter, who died in the Riverdale section of the \nBronx on Thursday at 95 after a career as one of the most prominent \nModern Orthodox rabbis in the United States, commandeered a jeep and \ndriver. He left headquarters and sped toward Buchenwald. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy late afternoon, when the rabbi drove through the gates, Allied \ntanks had breached the camp. He remembered, he later said, the sting \nof smoke in his eyes, the smell of burning flesh and the hundreds of \nbodies strewn everywhere. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe would remain at Buchenwald for months, tending to survivors, \nleading religious services in a former Nazi recreation hall and \neventually helping to resettle thousands of Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor his work, Rabbi Schacter was singled out by name on Friday by \nYisrael Meir Lau, the former Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, in a \nmeeting with President Obama at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust \nmemorial. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Buchenwald that April day, Rabbi Schacter said afterward, it \nseemed as though there was no one left alive. In the camp, he \nencountered a young American lieutenant who knew his way around. \u0014\n\u0014\nAre there any Jews alive here? the rabbi asked him. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was led to the Kleine Lager, or Little Camp, a smaller camp within \nthe larger one. There, in filthy barracks, men lay on raw wooden \nplanks stacked from floor to ceiling. They stared down at the rabbi, \nin his unfamiliar military uniform, with unmistakable fright. \u0014\n\u0014\nShalom Aleichem, Yidden, Rabbi Schacter cried in Yiddish, ihr zint \nfrei!  Peace be upon you, Jews, you are free! He ran from \nbarracks to barracks, repeating those words. He was joined by those \nJews who could walk, until a stream of people swelled behind him. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs he passed a mound of corpses, Rabbi Schacter spied a flicker of \nmovement. Drawing closer, he saw a small boy, Prisoner 17030, hiding \nin terror behind the mound. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was afraid of him, the child would recall long afterward in an \ninterview with The New York Times. I knew all the uniforms of SS and \nGestapo and Wehrmacht, and all of a sudden, a new kind of uniform. I \nthought, 'A new kind of enemy.'  \u0014\n\u0014\nWith tears streaming down his face, Rabbi Schacter picked the boy up. \nWhat's your name, my child? he asked in Yiddish. \u0014\n\u0014\nLulek, the child replied. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow old are you? the rabbi asked. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat difference does it make? Lulek, who was 7, said. I'm older \nthan you, anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do you think you're older? Rabbi Schacter asked, smiling. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause you cry and laugh like a child, Lulek replied. I haven't \nlaughed in a long time, and I don't even cry anymore. So which one of \nus is older? \u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Schacter discovered nearly a thousand orphaned children in \nBuchenwald. He and a colleague, Rabbi Robert Marcus, helped arrange \nfor their transport to France  a convoy that included Lulek and the \nteenage Elie Wiesel  as well as to Switzerland, a group personally \nconveyed by Rabbi Schacter, and to Palestine. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor decades afterward, Rabbi Schacter said, he remained haunted by \nhis time in Buchenwald, and by the question survivors put to him as \nhe raced through the camp that first day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were asking me, over and over, 'Does the world know what \nhappened to us?'  Rabbi Schacter told The Associated Press in 1981. \nAnd I was thinking, 'If my own father had not caught the boat on \ntime, I would have been there, too.'  \u0014\n\u0014\nHerschel Schacter was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn on \nOct. 10, 1917, the youngest of 10 children of parents who had come \nfrom Poland. His father, Pincus, was a seventh-generation shochet, or \nritual slaughterer; his mother, the former Miriam Schimmelman, was a \nreal estate manager. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Schacter earned a bachelor's degree from Yeshiva University in \nNew York in 1938; in 1941, he received ordination at Yeshiva from \nRabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, a founder of the Modern Orthodox \nmovement. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe spent about a year as a pulpit rabbi in Stamford, Conn., before \nenlisting in the Army as a chaplain in 1942. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Buchenwald was liberated, he spent every day there distributing \nmatzo (liberation had come just a week after \\Passover); leading \nservices for Shavuot, which celebrates the revelation of the Torah to \nMoses at Mount Sinai, and which fell that year in May; and conducting \nFriday night services. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt one of those services, Lulek and his older brother, Naftali, were \nable to say Kaddish for their parents, Polish Jews who had been \nkilled by the Nazis. \u0014\n\u0014\nDischarged from the Army with the rank of captain, Rabbi Schacter \nbecame the spiritual leader of the Mosholu Jewish Center, an Orthodox \nsynagogue on Hull Avenue in the north Bronx. He presided there from \n1947 until it closed in 1999. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a leader of many national Jewish groups, including the \nConference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, of which he \nwas a past chairman. He was most recently the director of rabbinic \nservices at Yeshiva. \u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Schacter, who in 1956 went to the Soviet Union with an American \nrabbinic delegation, was an outspoken advocate for the rights of \nSoviet Jews and an adviser on the subject to President Richard M. \nNixon. \u0014\n\u0014\nA resident of the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Rabbi Schacter is \nsurvived by his wife, the former Pnina Gewirtz, whom he married in \n1948; a son, Rabbi Jacob J. Schacter, who confirmed his father's \ndeath; a daughter, Miriam Schacter; four grandchildren; and eight \ngreat-grandchildren. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what of Lulek, the orphan Rabbi Schacter rescued from Buchenwald \nthat day? Lulek, who eventually settled in Palestine, grew up to be \nRabbi Yisrael Meir Lau. \u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Lau, who recounted his childhood exchange with Rabbi Schacter \nin a memoir, published in English in 2011 as Out of the Depths, was \nthe Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel from 1993 to 2003 and is now the \nchief rabbi of Tel Aviv. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Friday, when Rabbi Lau told Mr. Obama of his rescue by Rabbi \nSchacter  he thanked the American people for delivering Buchenwald \nsurvivors not from slavery to freedom, but from death to life  he \nhad not yet learned of Rabbi Schacter's death the day before. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, he was alive, Rabbi Lau said in an interview with The Times \non Monday. I speak about him with tears in my eyes.\u0014",

    "words": "Runaway Mom and the Madness of Midlife\u0014\nJennifer Grant, Christianity Today May 2013\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one picture, Brenda Heist smiles, with round cheeks and dark brown \neyes. In the next, taken 11 years later, her face is sad and sunken, \nframed with stringy blond hair. As disturbing as these side-by-side \nphotos appear, more chilling is the story that catapulted her into \nthe headlines last week.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002, Heist dropped her children off at school and then \nmysteriously disappeared, leaving family and friends to think she had \nbeen abducted and likely killed. But no foul play had come to Heist. \nNone, that is, except of her own making. Awash in self-pity over her \nbroken marriage and finances, she hitchhiked with strangers from \nPennsylvania to Florida, where she lived for the next decade, using \nthe name \"Lovie Smith,\" working as a day laborer and, later, a \nhousekeeper. She often resorted to sleeping on the street. Last week, \nreportedly in part due to mounting health problems, she turned \nherself in at a Key Largo police station.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer age at the moment when she erased her identity as a tidy suburban \nmom and became what some describe as a \"beach-bum hippie\" seems vital \nto this story. She left her family and her old life behind at 42.\u0014\n\u0014\nAh, to be an American woman in her 40s!\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, there's a lot of good that comes from four decades of \nexperience. Our skins are thicker; we are more fearless. We prune our \nlist of friends, keeping only the ones who make our spirits sing and \nno longer feeling the need to be liked by everyone. We don't worry \nquite as much about our appearance and just sigh with recognition \nwhen we are told that we are \"more beautiful than we think.\" If we \nare mothers, we begin to see the adults our children are becoming, \nand there is deep joy in that. Plus, it's often in our 40s when the \nrandom, misshapen puzzle pieces of our professional lives can come \ntogether into a coherent whole.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, make no mistake; being a woman in her 40s is no walk in the \npark, no matter how many articles declare \"40 is the new 30\" or even \n\"40 is the new 20.\" In our 40s, our marriages change. The honeymoon \nis long over  as is the blur of activity that caring for very young \nchildren requires. It's in their 40s that more people get divorced. \nMothers watch their children edge toward and enter adolescence. Month \nby month, we are forced to concede that those curmudgeons who warned: \n\"Little kids, little problems, big kids, big problems\" actually were \nright on. And it's in the decade of our 40s that college costs \nsuddenly loom large and retirement no longer feels so far away.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn our appearance-obsessed culture, the effects of time become harder \nto ignore at 40. We gray. Our eyebrows and lashes thin. We start \nlingering in the drugstore aisle perusing expensive eye creams. \nWhether or not we've experienced childbirth's effects on our bodies, \nperimenopause wreaks mischief  sometimes havoc  on our moods, sleep \npatterns, and physical selves. As Paul Simon crooned, wrangling with \nmidlife: we find ourselves asking \"Why am I soft in the middle? The \nrest of my life is so hard!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it makes a tragic sort of sense that Heist was 42 years when she \nditched her life. But what was her key mistake? Did she feel like she \nhad permission to hurt others because she'd been hurt? Did the \nindignities of stretch marks and the unseen, everyday tedium of \ncarpools and emptying the dishwasher overwhelm her? Did she not \nrealize she was more beautiful than she thought?\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before the people began to look for her, Heist was already a \nmissing person. When she met a few homeless people at the park the \nday of her departure, she says she was crying and \"feeling sorry for \nherself.\" Given the opportunity to leave the first half of her life \nbehind, she said she \"just snapped\" and took it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book Falling Upwards: A Spirituality for the Two Halves of \nLife, Richard Rohr writes that after spending the first part of our \nlives defining ourselves and setting ourselves up for a happy \nadulthood, we will experience crushing disappointment and loss. It \nmight the loss of a job, a marriage, treasured friendships, or an \nidentity that we have carefully wrought. Many of these changes may \nbecome the root of our \"midlife crisis,\" particularly a struggle over \nidentity. Rohr says, however, that what appears to be a falling down \nis actually an opportunity to fall upwards, deepen spiritually, and \nfind new purpose. We aren't forced to take this opportunity; we are \nfree to remain bitter, frustrated, and upset. Even at 40, many of us \nwill have another 40 years ahead of us, though the final half a \nlifetime will be much different than the first.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrenda Heist's disappearing act 11 years ago broke her children's \nhearts and thrust them into a new part of life. In interviews since \nHeist re-surfaced, her ex-husband appears to be a person who has \n\"fallen upward.\" He says he's forgiven her and describes his \ngratitude for his children and family in this second part of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNow it's Heist's turn  and all of our turns  to surrender our \ndisappointment, self-pity, and fear to a loving God who desires to \nbring all of us missing persons home.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrant is the author of Love You More: The Divine Surprise of Adopting \nMy Daughter and MOMumental: Adventures in the Messy Art of Raising a \nFamily. Disquiet Time, a book she is co-editing with journalist and \nauthor Cathleen Falsani, will be released in autumn 2014. Find her \nonline at jennifergrant.com.\u0014",

    "title": "RULES FOR A \"JUST WAR\"",
    "words": "What are the \"Just War\" \nrules?\u0014\nHere are the rules:\u0014\n\u0014\nJust Cause. Protecting innocent human life is a just cause. Stopping \ngenocide is a just cause for war. U.S. military intervention in \nRwanda to halt genocide would have been a moral use of force, for \nexample. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust Authority. Presidents need congressional authority. Obama is \nseeking congressional authority, although he has said that he doesn't \nneed congressional authorization. He has dismissed the need for \napproval from the United Nations Security Council.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast Resort. Nations must exhaust efforts at resolving a conflict \nbefore launching a war.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust Intent. Economic gain and punishing wrongdoing are wrongful \nreasons for war. Claiming the need to protect Israel by bombing Syria \ndoesn't qualify either. Restoring U.S. honor after Syria has crossed \nthe \"red line\" of using chemical weapons hardly passes the test of \njust intent. \u0014\n\u0014\nProbability of Success. A just war must have a high chance to achieve \nits stated purpose. Obama's resolution to Congress said that the \nobjective of a strike is \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the \npotential for, future uses of chemical weapons, or other weapons of \nmass destruction. What is the likelihood that that will be achieved?\u0014\n\u0014\nProportionality of Cost. For a war to be just, the war must do more \ngood than harm. Does a U.S. strike prolong the civil war, create more \nrefugees and trigger more attacks on the Christian community in the \nregion?\u0014\n\u0014\nJust Means. Targeting non-combatant civilians is immoral. If \nnon-combatant civilians are killed unintentionally, that is morally \ntolerable. That is what is called the double effect. Targeting urban \nareas in the midst of a civil war makes a U.S. strike against Syria \nproblematic.\u0014\n\u0014\nClear Announcement. Reasons for war and reconciliation must be \nspelled out clearly. The U.S. must state clearly why and when Syria \nwill be struck. And what Syria can do to avoid being attacked.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are high moral hurdles to cross. Yet better to cross them than \nto rush into war  war is always more costly with more negative \nunforeseen consequences than projected by government leaders, \nmunitions profiteers and pundits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy using the arguments of \"Just War,\" Christian leaders make going to \nwar a tough sell. They also fulfill one of their moral duties of \noffering a prophetic witness. Offering a countercultural witness in a \nsociety that hardly blinks about military spending, drone strikes and \ndeadly force is much needed.\u0014",

    "words": "Rochus Misch, Bodyguard of Hitler, Dies at 96\u0014\nBy MARGALIT FOX\u0014\nPublished: September 6, 2013    New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRochus Misch, Hitlers wartime bodyguard, who was widely described as \nthe last living witness to the Fhrers final days in his underground \nbunker as the Soviet Army closed in on Berlin, died in that city on \nThursday. He was 96. \u0014\n\u0014\nBurkhard Nachtigall, the co-author of Mr. Mischs memoir, Der Letzte \nZeuge (The Last Witness), published in German in 2008, confirmed \nthe death to The Associated Press. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the spring of 1945, Mr. Misch was one of the few members of \nHitlers inner circle to take up residence with him in the bunker, \nbeneath the chancellery, the government headquarters in Berlin. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the bunker, Mr. Misch was present for the hasty marriage of Hitler \nand his mistress, Eva Braun; their suicides soon afterward; and the \nmurder by Magda Goebbels, the wife of Hitlers propaganda minister, \nJoseph Goebbels, of the six Goebbels children. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo the end of his life, Mr. Misch  who was a Soviet prisoner of war \nbefore returning to Germany in the mid-1950s  remained to all \nappearances a devoted admirer of the man he called the boss. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven now, The Toronto Star wrote in 1995, Rochus Mischs eyes \nstill take on a special shine whenever he speaks his name. \u0014\n\u0014\nInterviewing Mr. Misch in 2003, The Sunday Express, the British \nnewspaper, put it more bluntly, calling him the most unrepentant and \nunapologetic Hitler supporter you could ever have the misfortune to \nmeet. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe paper quoted him as saying: It was a good time with Hitler. I \nenjoyed it, and I was proud to work for him. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Mischs newspaper interviews, his appearance in European \ntelevision documentaries and the publication of his memoir made him a \nminor celebrity, a role he seemed to relish. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt his home in a working-class Berlin suburb, he received a stream of \nfan mail, to which he replied with autographed pictures of himself in \nhis S.S. uniform. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 2005 article, Salon.com wrote of Mr. Mischs habit, in old age, \nof showing up unannounced at the site of Hitlers bunker, where he \naddressed visiting tourists: \u0014\n\u0014\nHello! Hello! Dont you know me? he cried. Im Misch! I was \nthere! \u0014\n\u0014\nRochus Misch was born on July 29, 1917, in Alt Schalkowitz in Upper \nSilesia, then part of Imperial Germany and now part of Poland. He was \norphaned young  his father was killed in World War I; his mother \ndied of pneumonia in 1920  and was reared by his grandparents. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Misch joined the S.S. in 1937. Two years later, he was shot and \nwounded during the Nazis Polish campaign. Recovering, he was invited \nto become, with Johannes Hentschel, one of Hitlers two chief \nbodyguards and assistants. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe two men were tasked with accompanying Hitler everywhere. Some \nduties were purely social: Mr. Misch once served tea to a visiting \nLeni Riefenstahl, the maker of Nazi propaganda films. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn late April 1945, as the Soviet Army neared Berlin, Mr. Misch \nretreated to the bunker with Mr. Hentschel, Hitler and a few others. \nMr. Hentschel operated the air, water and lights, Mr. Misch the \ntelephones, taking charge of the switchboard that connected Hitler to \nhis men outside. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 28, Mr. Misch saw Goebbels and Hitlers private secretary, \nMartin Bormann, enter the bunker with a third man. The man was a \ncivil magistrate, who married Hitler and Braun in the early hours of \nthe 29th. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe marriage was over by about 2:30 a.m., and I wondered how I would \naddress her  Mrs. Hitler? Mr. Misch told The Sunday Express. \u0014\nIt was a moot question. On April 30, knowing their cause was lost, \nthe couple committed suicide  Hitler with a gunshot to the temple, \nBraun with poison. \u0014\n\u0014\nI didnt hear the shots myself because I was working on the \ntelephones, Mr. Misch told the news service Agence France-Presse in \n2005. But then I heard someone shout, Linge, Linge, I think it has \nhappened.  (Heinz Linge was Hitlers valet.) \u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 1, Mr. Misch watched Magda Goebbels lead her children, dressed \nin white nightgowns  like a duck with six ducklings, he later said \n up a staircase to the bunkers upper level. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere the children were given a sedative, after which Mrs. Goebbels \nbroke cyanide capsules into their mouths. Then, Mr. Misch recalled, \nshe sat at a table, playing solitaire and drinking champagne. She and \nher husband killed themselves shortly afterward. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 2, Mr. Misch fled the bunker and was captured by Soviet \ntroops. He spent the next nine years in prison camps in the Soviet \nUnion. \u0014\n\u0014\nResettling in West Germany in 1954, Mr. Misch ran a paint and \nwallpaper store  an occupation hauntingly reminiscent of his mentor, \nwho was said to have plied a similar trade in Austria before his rise \nto power. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn interviews, Mr. Misch was often asked whether he had heard Hitler \nspeak of the Third Reichs murder of six million Jews. He always \nreplied in the negative. \u0014\n\u0014\nI ask you, he said in the Salon interview, if Hitler really did \nall the terrible things people now say he did, how could he have been \nour Fhrer? How is it possible? \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Mischs wife, Gerda, whom he married in 1942, died in 1997. In \n2009, the BBC quoted their daughter, Brigitta Jacob-Engelken, as \nsaying that she had been told by her maternal grandmother that Gerda \nMisch was originally Jewish. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe is still saying, No, I wont believe that!  Ms. \nJacob-Engelken, describing her father, then 92, told the BBC. But I \nknow it from my grandma. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Jacob-Engelken, an architect who lives in Germany and who has \nlong been estranged from her father, is among his survivors. \nAccording to the BBC report, Ms. Jacob-Engelken learned Hebrew and \nlived for a time on an Israeli kibbutz. In Germany, her work has \nincluded the restoration of local synagogues.\u0014",

Luci Baines Johnson leaned forward in her father's \nprivate suite at the L.B.J. Presidential Library, her voice breaking \nas she recounted the agony of Vietnam that engulfed \\Lyndon Baines \nJohnson and the pain she feels to this day of witnessing his \npresidency judged through the prism of a failed war.\u0014\n\u0014\nNobody wanted that war less than Lyndon Johnson, said Ms. Johnson, \n66, who is the president's younger daughter. No matter how hard he \ntried, he didn't seem to be able to get out of that quagmire. Not \nonly did he not get out of it in his lifetime, but his legacy indeed \nhas that weight of the world on it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now, 50 years later  with a coming rush of anniversaries of the \nlegislative milestones of the Johnson presidency  Ms. Johnson and \nthe diminishing circle of family and friends from those White House \nyears have commenced one last campaign. They are seeking a \nreconsideration of Johnson's legacy as president, arguing that it has \nbeen overwhelmed by the tragedy of the Vietnam War, and has failed to \ntake into account the blizzard of domestic legislation enacted in the \nfive years Johnson was in the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Monday, the L.B.J. Presidential Library and Museum will announce \ndetails of a Civil Rights Summit to be held here in April to \ncommemorate Johnson's signing of the Civil Rights Act, attended by \nthree of the four living former presidents  Jimmy Carter, Bill \nClinton and George W. Bush  and perhaps President Obama. \u0014\n\u0014\nA ceremony is being planned inside the massive slab of the L.B.J. \nLibrary, to be followed by celebrations of the 50th anniversary of \nJohnson initiatives: Medicare, the Clean Air Act, public \nbroadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Head Start, \nthe requirements for seatbelts, and warnings on cigarette packs. The \nevents are intended to offer a counterweight to the way Johnson has \nbeen portrayed over the past decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur goal has NEVER been to create a false image of L.B.J., wrote \nTom Johnson, a former president of CNN and a former publisher of The \nLos Angeles Times, who served for 40 years as chairman of the L.B.J. \nFoundation, in an email to other foundation members. What we are \nstriving to do is to achieve recognition of the truth about L.B.J.'s \nyears, most of which (except Vietnam and some recognition of civil \nrights) has been forgotten or swamped by Vietnam.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Johnson responded to that with a one-word note: AMEN!\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry Temple, a former Johnson aide who is the chairman of the \n\\L.B.J. Foundation, said the coming months might offer a last \nopportunity for the surviving members of the Johnson administration \nto make his case. The next five years will be the 50th anniversary \nof everything he did, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/ Rescuing a Vietnam Casualty\u0014",

You can wash \nyour feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the \nmorning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\" 3 But \nhe insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his \nhouse.

    "words": "Rabbi, Little League Coach, Police Officers, Nurses Among 70 Arrested \nin Online Child Porn Ring\u0014\nBy Jonathan Dienst and Joe Valiquette \u0014\n Wednesday, May 21, 2014    New York\u0014\n\u0014\nA rabbi, a little league coach, police officers, nurses and the \nmother of an infant are among more than 70 people arrested for \nallegedly sharing child pornography images and video online in what \nauthorities are calling one of the largest local roundups of people \nwho anonymously trade such images on the Internet, officials say. \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities said the victims who were sexually exploited and \nphotographed range in age from newborn to 17. In some videos, \nchildren were fondled. Others showed them having sex with adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs part of the operation, authorities set up a website run by law \nenforcement that solicited illicit images of children. During the \ncourse of the five-week investigation, undercover Department of \nHomeland Security investigators along with NYPD detectives identified \nnearly 150 distinct IP addresses registered to people in the New York \nCity area actively involved in trading sexually explicit images of \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne defendant was already on bail following his arrest last year on \ncharges he used the Internet to direct women to record sex acts with \nyoung children. Court papers allege he \"indicated the last video he \nhad downloaded and viewed depicted a mother sexually abusing her 3- \nor 4-year-old child.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother is charged with producing and distributing child pornography \ninvolving her own young child.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral of the defendants facing charges held positions of public \ntrust, including two police officers, two registered nurses, a \nparamedic, an au pair, and an individual who served as both a den \nmaster with the Boy Scouts of America and a little league baseball \ncoach. The rabbi home-schooled children. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeventy-one suspects were arrested in total. \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities say advances in technology and computer capacity have \nallowed child-porn collectors to more easily amass vast troves of \ndisturbing images and to exchange files with each other directly. In \nthis case, the suspects allegedly used P2P software -- or \npeer-to-peer file-sharing services -- to share the images. Nearly 600 \ndesktop and laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices \ncontaining a total of 175 terabytes of storage were seized as part of \nthe investigation. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The sheer volume of confirmed and suspected instances of individuals \nengaging in the sexual exploitation of children identified through \nOperation Caireen is shocking and the professional backgrounds of \nmany of the defendants is troubling,\" said James T. Hayes Jr., \nspecial agent in charge of HSI New York. \"We can no longer assume \nthat the only people who would stoop to prey on children are \nunemployed drifters.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAgents are still examining the devices to locate and catalog evidence \n-- an arduous task that could result in more arrests. The National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children also will use its analysts \nto review the images to see whether it can identify children using \ndatabases of known victims.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We refer to each of these images as a crime scene photo because \nthat's exactly what they are,'' said John Ryan, the organization's \nchief executive officer. \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities decided to launch the operation after the January arrest \nof the former police chief of suburban Mount Pleasant, Brian Fanelli, \nwho pleaded not guilty this week to federal charges of knowingly \nreceiving and distributing child pornography.\u0014\n\u0014\nCourt papers allege that Fanelli told investigators he began looking \nat child porn as research before it grew into a \"personal interest.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Reformation's Religious Image-Breaking Spurred Literacy \u0014\nPhilip Jenkins\u0014\n\u0014\nFriday, July 18, 2014    EthicDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent Times Literary Supplement, David Motadel reviewed James \nNoyes' 2013 book, \"The Politics of Iconoclasm: Religion, Violence and \nthe Culture of Image-Breaking in Christianity and Islam.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe review and the associated scholarship raise important questions \nabout how we conceive of, teach about and, significantly, how we will \ncommemorate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The prototype of all modern forms of iconoclasm [Noyes] found in \nCalvin's Geneva and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's Mecca. Sixteenth-century \nGeneva witnessed one of the most devastating waves of religious \nimage-breaking in history,\" Motadel writes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Incited by a group of charismatic theologiansamong them John Calvin \nhimselfmobs raged against objects associated with miracles, magic \nand the supernatural, destroying some of the city's most precious \npieces of Christian art. Invoking the Second Commandment, they \ndenounced these works as idols, and as remnants of a rural, feudal \nand superstitious world, a world corrupted by Satan,\" Motadel added.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor was Geneva unusual. In Basel in 1529, widespread iconoclastic \nriots destroyed virtually all the material tokens of traditional \nCatholic worship and devotion in the cathedral and the city's leading \nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven these German and Swiss manifestations were dwarfed by the \ndevastating \"Storm of Images\" that swept over the Netherlands in 1566.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis movement was directed against Catholic material \nsymbolsstained-glass windows, statues of the Virgin and saints, holy \nmedals and tokens.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch stories of image-breaking (iconoclasm) are familiar enough. \nRecent works, though, highlight two features of the movement that \noften get underplayed:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Iconoclasm was central to the Reformation experience, not \nmarginal, and not just a regrettable extravagance.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians of the Reformation tend to focus on aspects of literacy \nand translation, with the spread of the vernacular Bible as the \ncenterpiece of the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutbreaks of destructive violence and iconoclasm are usually \npresented as marginal excesses, or understandable instances of \npopular fury against church abuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's very misleading.\u0014\n\u0014\nIconoclasm was not just an incidental breakdown of law and order; it \nwas the core of the whole movement, the necessary other side of the \ncoin to the growth of literacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose visual and symbolic representations of the Christian story had \nto decrease, in order for the world of the published Bible to \nincrease.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of the lived experience of people at the time, the \nimage-breaking is the key component of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the rioting and mayhem, a millennium-old religious order was \nvisibly and comprehensively smashed.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestant historians sometimes write as if the Reformation brought \nreligious knowledge and spirituality to a continent from which it had \nbeen largely lacking.\u0014\n\u0014\nPre-Reformation believers had ample access to the Christian tradition \nbut usually mediated through nonliterate forms, through drama and \nvisual culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Reformation states and mobs destroyed or suppressed those \nalternative cultural forms, they removed popular access to the \nunderstanding of faith and the Christian story.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was also an unabashedly top-down phenomenon. Image breaking was \ninvariably the work of urban mobs, in societies that were \noverwhelmingly rural.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Reformation was a war of the cities against the countryside, of \nthe 10 percent (perhaps) against the 90 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be decades or centuries before the new religious order based \non books and literacy would disseminate throughout the whole country, \nincluding rural areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nUrban communities spent those decades sneering at the religious \nignorance of the peasants.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the perspective of visual art and culture, the Reformation was \none of the greatest catastrophes that ever befell Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also had a massive class bias, in that it targeted objects beloved \nby ordinary people, while princes and dukes were able to safeguard \ntheir classical treasures.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, there were also cultural gains in the form of mass \nliteracy and new forms of visual media, including pamphlets and \ncartoons.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in terms of paintings, murals, sculpture, architecture and \nstained glass, the losses were irreparable.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies of vernacular culture and piety vanished within a \ngeneration.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Analogies between the European Reformation and contemporary \nIslamism are much closer than many Protestants would like to admit.\u0014\n\u0014\nNoyes compares Calvin closely to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-92), the \nfounder of the ultraconservative Wahhabi Islamic movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Calvinism, Wahhabi Islam urged the destruction of everything \nthat could be seen as a later accretion to the core of the religion \nas well as all manifestations of paganism or idolatry.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the 1920s, this version of the faith has been the official \ncreed of Saudi Arabia, and variants of it are found among Islam's \nviolent and extreme movements.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wahhabi tradition has destroyed numerous shrines and holy places \nin the past half-century or so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis includes the Taliban's destruction of the Buddhas in \nAfghanistan, the attempted eradication of the glorious shrines and \nlibraries of Timbuktu, and the annihilation of most of the ancient \nshrines and tombs around Mecca itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Egyptian Islamists fantasize about eradicating all the ruins of \npagan ancient Egypt, including the Pyramids themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern Westerners are rightly appalled by such acts as desecrations \nof humanity's cultural heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut such outrage demonstrates a near-total awareness of the West's \nown history.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing that the Islamists have done in this regard would cause the \n16th century Protestant Reformers to lose a moment's sleep.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am sometimes bemused to hear Western commentators call for \ncontemporary Islam to experience a \"Reformation,\" by which they mean \nan opening to freedom and toleration.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is an extremely distorted view of Christianity's own Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nArguably, Islam has been going through its own Reformation for a \ncentury or so, which is exemplified by the Wahhabis and Salafists. \nThat's the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn comparing the Protestant Reformers with contemporary Wahhabis, I \nam not commenting on their theology, attitude to violence or social \nissues like the status of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am speaking very specifically about attitudes to images in \nreligious devotion and the absolute supremacy of the written text, \nwith the physical iconoclasm that followed from those positions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt will be interesting to see how prominently this iconoclastic \naspect of the Reformation heritage will be celebrated come 2017. My \nsuspicion is, scarcely at all.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Jenkins is distinguished professor of history at Baylor \nUniversity in Waco, Texas, and serves as co-director for the program \non historical studies of religion in the Institute for Studies of \nReligion.

    "words": "U.S. Religious Leaders Embrace Cause of Immigrant Children\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MICHAEL PAULSON   JULY 23, 2014  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States response to the arrival of tens of thousands of \nmigrant children, many of them fleeing violence and exploitation in \nCentral America, has been symbolized by an angry pushback from \ncitizens and local officials who have channeled their outrage over \nillegal immigration into opposition to proposed shelter sites. But \naround the nation, an array of religious leaders are trying to \nmobilize support for the children, saying the nation can and should \nwelcome them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere talking about whether were going to stand at the border and \ntell children who are fleeing a burning building to go back inside, \nsaid Rabbi Asher Knight of Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, who said \nleaders of more than 100 faith organizations in his city had met last \nweek to discuss how to help. He said that in his own congregation, \nsome were comparing the flow of immigrant children to the \nKindertransport, a rescue mission in the late 1930s that sent Jewish \nchildren from Nazi Germany to Britain for safekeeping.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question for us is: How do we want to be remembered, as yelling \nand screaming to go back, or as using the teachings of our traditions \nto have compassion and love and grace for the lives of Gods \nchildren? Rabbi Knight said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe backlash to the backlash is broad, from Unitarian Universalists \nand Quakers to evangelical Protestants. Among the most agitated are \nCatholic bishops, who have long allied with Republican politicians \nagainst abortion and same-sex marriage, and leaders of the Southern \nBaptist Convention, whose adherents tend to lean right.\u0014",

    "words": "The news media is setting the black community up for another Trayvon \nMartin-style disappointment by publishing or broadcasting conflicting \nstatements by witnesses as if these statements will be repeated \nbefore a jury. There is huge difference between what witnesses say \nto reporters and what they say in sworn statements and in sworn \ntestimony and cross examination before a jury. St. Louis \nPost-Dispatch crime reporter Christine Byers has tweeted that police \nsources tell her that they have more a dozen witness statements that \nsupport the police officer, but we haven't heard what these witnesses \nsaid; we have only heard from witnesses eager to go on national \ntelevision in front of hundreds of chanting protestors. Few, if any, \nof these witnesses will be called to testify. For example, it \nunlikely that Michael Brown's companion Dorian Johnson will be called \nto testified, even though he is considered the star witness. He has \ngiven conflicting statements to the press and obviously lied when he \ntold reporters that he and Brown wasn't breaking no laws or doing \nnobody any harm when they were actually walking away from a \nstrong-armed robbery. At the time of their encounter with Officer \nDarren Wilson, Johnson had an outstanding warrant for a theft in \nJefferson City and had pleaded guilty for filing a false police \nreport related to that theft. Besides, he told reporters that Wilson \nshot Brown in the back, a claim refuted by the autopsy. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe news media distorts the debate over police shootings in which the \nvictims are unarmed downplaying the fact that unarmed felons are far \nmore dangerous than armed police officers. The FBI Uniform Crime \nReport (Expanded Homicide Data Table 8) shows that unarmed people in \n2012, unarmed individuals beat, kicked or stomped 678 Americans to \ndeath. In contrast, the Uniform Crime Report show police officers \nshooting and kill about 400 people a year, but many police shootings \nsave lives by freeing hostages or stopping shooting sprees. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe news media feeds black paranoia by ignoring police shootings in \nwhich victims are white. Two days after Michael Brown's death Dallas \npolice shot and killed a 26-year-old Andrew Gaynier who they said was \nadvancing toward them in a threatening manner. The shooting was \nsimilar in some ways to the Brown shooting. The shooting took place \nin broad daylight in front of witnesses and police knew Gaynier was \nunarmed, but Gaynier was white. Therefore, the incident received no \nnational news coverage. However, the subsequent shooting by St. Louis \npolice of a black man armed with a knife is receiving extensive news \ncoverage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the majority of police shooting victims are white, a \ndisproportionate number are black; however, black also commit a \ndisproportionate number of violent crimes, a factor the news media to \nmention. The FBI Uniform Crime Report shows that police kill about \n400 people each year while criminals murder about 75 police officers \na year. The FBI Uniform Crime Report shows blacks murdered 37 percent \nof police officers killed in the line of duty during 2011, the most \nrecent year for which data is complete, even though they make up only \n13 percent of the population. A 2001 U.S. Justice Department study \nconcluded that just as black suspects are five times more likely \nthan white suspects to die at the hands of police, police officers \nare five times more likely to die at the hands of a black suspect \nthan a white suspect.\"\u0014\nWm. Case, Texas\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWe've all seen the convenience store video, which is very telling. We \nall know Mike Brown punched a police officer in the face. We've seen \nthe mob rule in Ferguson, the chaos, the urine bottles thrown at \npolice, the looting for TVs-- one young lady said on the news \"we \ndeserve this stuff.\" We've seen Eric Holder, the media, & elected \nofficials display their bias against officer Wilson, without knowing \nthe facts, bc they care more about making a civil rights statement \nthan real, law-based justice & due process. We've heard the threat of \nriots if a guilty verdict isn't reached. Jackson25, Dallas\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue of the police and their attitudes toward blacks, especially \ntowards black men, has nothing to do with poverty, unemployment, and \nlack of education, and all to do with racism. When university \nprofessors and bankers in their own upscale neighborhoods get \nstopped, questioned about what they're doing in that neighborhood, \nand not believed when they point out their own homes, that's racism. \nCheck out the transcript of the Diane Rehm Show from August 21st for \nan example. When black men driving expensive cars get stopped, and \nthe police assumption is that the car was stolen or the driver is a \ndrug dealer, that's racism. Wake up and really see what's going on \naround you. People that believe these kinds of incidents are fiction, \nand not the daily humiliations that they truly are, are part of the \nproblem. If you don't believe there's a problem, you're not going to \nwork to solve it. Houston\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest and most disturbing mystery of all is why they left his \nbody to rot in the street for 4 hours. That we *know.* That deserves \nmore reporting and more anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nEsp, illinois\u0014\n\u0014\nWonder what would have happened if those two black teen agers would \nhave just removed themselves to the sidewalk? In light of the fact \nthat the one had just robbed a store and pushed the store owner \naround, had the police asked me to move onto the sidewalk, I would \nhave. In fact, I would have removed myself to the sidewalk \nregardless. Peaceful demonstrations are a positive response; however \nlooting and rioting are not. It just further demonstrates the lack of \nrespect for community (their own community) and law and order.\u0014",

Some may have been true believers; others, pro forma \nmembers. Many referred to God or Divine Providence in their personal \nwritings. I suspect that in private, many prayed for the new country. \nThat famous portrait of Washington praying at Valley Forge may be \naccurate, for all I know, though the story goes he usually left \nchurch before Communion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there are no such references to any of these in the Constitution. \nNone. And no references to Christianity. None. It is an absolutely \nsecular document.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only reference to religion in the founding document is in the \nFirst Amendment  and that is a prohibition banning the establishment \nof any one sect! No possible reading of that document can make \ntodays right-wing version of Protestantism the established church \nfor America.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, there is considerable evidence that the Fathers favored the \nwidest possible separation of church and state. Jefferson, the deist, \ngets the most credit, based on his famous 1802 letter to the Danbury \nBaptists: I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act (Amendment \n1) of the whole American people which declared that their legislature \nshould make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of \nseparation between Church & State.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson believed in that separation so strongly that he refused to \ndeclare a national day of prayer. Likewise he refused to have a \nchapel built at the new state-funded University of Virginia he was \nfounding. Remember, this is the same Jefferson who once wrote, But \nit does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or \nno God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. And the \nJefferson who cited his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom as \nbeing among his three greatest achievements.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jefferson was not alone. James Madison, in 1811, was presented a \nbill to sign: a bill to incorporate a Protestant Episcopal church in \nWashington, D.C. He vetoed it.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Williams, founder of the colony of Rhode Island, was an even \nearlier advocate of the church-state separation. He fled persecution \nfrom the Puritan-run Massachusetts Bay Colony to begin a haven of \nreligious freedom. In the original charter of 1644 we find this \nextraordinary promise: No person  at any time hereafter shall be \nany wise molested, punished, disquieted, or called into question for \nany differences in matters of (religious) opinion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams, a Baptist minister, allowed Jews, Quakers and all other \ndissenters to freely worship  or not worship  in his colony. Yes, \nhe even welcomed atheists. Scattered in his writings are lines such \nas this: Forced religion stinks in the nostrils of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese men knew enough history to recognize the dangerous precedent \nthat lay there  that every such attempt had ended in persecution and \nbloodshed and ultimate failure. Some even commented on the bloody \nsoil of Europe that had been stained by the deaths of religious \nmartyrs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeve come through some heated political campaigns in which various \ncandidates and their supporters argued for a re-establishment of \nreligion, for a merging of church and state. Weve heard many a \ncandidate blithely announce that we are a Christian nation and \nfounded on the Bible, etc., etc. Weve heard pseudo-historians such \nas David Barton wrongly argue for a mandate from the Christian \nFounders for a modern-day theocracy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSad. Very sad. And so wrong. Poor education and excellent \nbrainwashing get most of the blame, though no doubt those advocating \nspecial status for religion and the religious think that they and \ntheir sect will be the only beneficiaries. They do not want equality \n they want supremacy. Anything short of supremacy, they view as \npersecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly we cannot prove persecution of Christians in a nation where \nmillions wear crosses publicly, where church attendance is still \nstrong, where some television channels carry nothing but Christian \nprogramming, and where 44 consecutive presidents have been \nChristian of one stripe or another.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, we, like John F. Kennedy, want a total separation:\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe in an America where the separation of church and state is \nabsolute; where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should \nhe be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his \nparishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is \ngranted any public funds or political preference; and where no man is \ndenied public office merely because his religion differs from the \npresident who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronic, isnt it, that in less than 60 years, we seem to be losing \nthat vision? Its time to reclaim it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Black is a retired English teacher, retired minister, poet and \nessayist from Louisa.\u0014",

It's like the behavioral psychologist \u0014\nRobert Anthony said: \"Most people would rather \u0014\nbe miserable than risk being happy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's the danger. If we say \"No\" to God's call \u0014\nlong enough, we stop hearing it. Episcopal Priest \u0014\nBarbara Brown Taylor explained it this way: \"You \u0014\ncan say 'no' to life, you can say 'no' to a miracle, \u0014\nbut if you do, rest assured no angels will trouble \u0014\nyou ever again.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nConsider all the people who have faced down \u0014\ntheir fears and not only escaped their own slav- \u0014\nery, but led others to freedom: Harriet Tubman \u0014\nand her Underground Railroad; Sitting Bull defend- \u0014\ning his people against the slavery of a reservation; \u0014\nMahatma Gandhi; or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Fear \u0014\nis OK, but fear that holds us back is not.\u0014",

    "words": "Religions killing fields: When will we ever learn?\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious people have been decapitating, burning, hacking and bombing \neach other to death in Gods name for a long time.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bill Leonard\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterwards it happened, before I had ever heard of the existence of \n[Anabaptist] brethren, that a godfearing, pious man, named Sicke \nSnyder, was beheaded at Leeuwarden, for being rebaptized. It sounded \nstrange to me, to hear a second baptism spoken of. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo the 16th-century Catholic priest Menno Simons described a radical \nchange in his theology that would ultimately lead him into leadership \nof a group of Anabaptists who eventually took his name, Mennonites. \nThat spiritual journey began, at least in part, when Menno learned of \nthe violent execution of Snyder, a wiedertaufer  rebaptizer  \ndecapitated at the hands of Catholics for receiving believers \nbaptism. I think of him sometimes, in the baptistery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1553, Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician who denied the \ndoctrines of the Trinity and infant baptism, showed up in Geneva to \nhear his nemesis, John Calvin, preach. Recognized and arrested, \nServetus was tried for heresy and condemned to be burned at the \nstake. Calvin (and other Protestant reformers) acquiesced to the \nsentence, although Calvin apparently advocated the more humane \nmode, decapitation. Before Servetus arrival Calvin had asserted that \nif the heretic showed up in Geneva, I shall never let him go out \nalive if my authority has weight. I thought of Servetus this week \nwhen a Jesus-only Pentecostal student freely announced her \nanti-Trinitarianism in my class.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose events came to mind when we learned that Peter Kassig, \n26-year-old Iraq-war veteran and former Army Ranger, was decapitated \nby Islamic State militants. Kassig, captured while working in Syria \nwith the aid organization he had established, converted to Islam and \ntook the name Abdul-Rahman. That conversion did not stop Islamic \nradicals from beheading him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly days later, religion and executions collided in Jerusalem. The \nNew York Times reported: The Orthodox Jewish men were facing east, \nto honor the Old City site where the ancient temples once stood, when \ntwo Palestinians armed with a gun, knives and axes burst into their \nsynagogue  shouting God is great! in Arabic. Within moments, three \nrabbis and a fourth pious man lay dead, blood pooling on their prayer \nshawls and a fourth pious man lay dead, blood pooling on their prayer \nshawls and holy books. The assailants, cousins from East Jerusalem, \nwere killed at the scene in a gun battle with the police that wounded \ntwo officers; one [a Druze] died of his injuries.  Politicians and \nothers around the world condemned the attack and the rising religious \ndimension of the spate of violence, which has been attributed mainly \nto a struggle over the very site the victims were praying toward.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid these events, a United Nations report documented fatalities \nduring the recent Israeli/Palestinian war: six Israeli civilians, \namong them a 4-year-old boy; in Gaza 2,000 dead, including some 500 \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nTantum religio potuit suadere malorum, the Roman philosopher \nLucretius wrote: To such heights of evil are men driven by \nreligion. Lets face it. Religious people have been decapitating, \nburning, hacking and bombing each other to death in Gods name for a \nlong, long time, no end in sight. Today, much public religion often \nseems committed to producing fanatics whose unilateral faith compels \nimplicit/explicit destruction of non-believers; or creating \natheists, who see all this and agree with both title and premise of \nChristopher Hitchens 2007 book, God Is Not Great: How Religion \nPoisons Everything. Some Muslims may seem hell-bent on proving that \ntruth right now, but we Christians have done our share for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Calvins Barbaric World  The Case of Michael Servetus, John \nPiper offers one way of reading both historical and present day \nreligion-attributed atrocities: So the times were harsh and immoral \nand barbaric, and had a contaminating effect on everyone, just as we \nare all contaminated today by the evils of our time.  It would be \nfoolhardy to say that we would have never done what they did under \ntheir circumstances, and thus draw the conclusion that they have \nnothing to teach us. In fact, what we probably need to say is that \nsome of our evils are such that we are blind to them, just as they \nwere blind to many of theirs. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmid a shocking degree of evangelical relativism, Piper has a point. \nIn every era religion criminalizes the other at some point. Yet, \nthank God, when faith and decapitation seem almost synonymous, some \npeople see beyond their times, offering a higher vision of divine \ngrace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1524, another Anabaptist, Balthasar Hubmaier, wrote Concerning \nHeretics and Those Who Burn Them, declaring: The inquisitors are the \ngreatest heretics of all, since, against the doctrine and example of \nChrist, they condemn heretics to the fire, and before the time of \nharvest [judgment] root up the wheat with the tares. For Christ did \nnot come to butcher, destroy, and burn, but that those that live \nmight live more abundantly.  A Turk or a heretic is not convinced by \nour act, either with the sword or with fire, but only with patience \nand prayer; and so we should await with patience the judgment of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth, Hubmaier concluded, is eternal. You cant kill it, even in \nGods name. Catholics burned him at the stake in 1527. He was \ndead-right, then and now. When will we ever learn? When will we ever \nlearn?\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Leonard is James and Marilyn Dunn Professor of Church History \nand Baptist Studies at the School of Divinity, Wake Forest University.\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBER THE SAND CREEK MASSACRE",
    "words": "Remember the Sand Creek Massacre\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NED BLACKHAWK  NOV. 27, 2014 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nNEW HAVEN  MANY people think of the Civil War and America's Indian \nwars as distinct subjects, one following the other. But those who \nstudy the Sand Creek Massacre know different\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Nov. 29, 1864, as Union armies fought through Virginia and \nGeorgia, Col. John Chivington led some 700 cavalry troops in an \nunprovoked attack on peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho villagers at Sand \nCreek in Colorado. They murdered nearly 200 women, children and older \nmen.\u0014\n\u0014\nSand Creek was one of many assaults on American Indians during the \nwar, from Patrick Edward Connor's massacre of Shoshone villagers \nalong the Idaho-Utah border at Bear River on Jan. 29, 1863, to the \nforced removal and incarceration of thousands of Navajo people in \n1864 known as the Long Walk.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of sheer horror, few events matched Sand Creek. Pregnant \nwomen were murdered and scalped, genitalia were paraded as trophies, \nand scores of wanton acts of violence characterize the accounts of \nthe few Army officers who dared to report them. Among them was Capt. \nSilas Soule, who had been with Black Kettle and Cheyenne leaders at \nthe September peace negotiations with Gov. John Evans of Colorado, \nthe region's superintendent of Indians affairs (as well as a founder \nof both the University of Denver and Northwestern University). Soule \npublicly exposed Chivington's actions and, in retribution, was later \nmurdered in Denver.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter news of the massacre spread, Evans and Chivington were forced \nto resign from their appointments. But neither faced criminal \ncharges, and the government refused to compensate the victims or \ntheir families in any way. Indeed, Sand Creek was just one part of a \ncampaign to take the Cheyenne's once vast land holdings across the \nregion. A territory that had hardly any white communities in 1850 \nhad, by 1870, lost many Indians, who were pushed violently off the \nGreat Plains by white settlers and the federal government.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese and other campaigns amounted to what is today called ethnic \ncleansing: an attempted eradication and dispossession of an entire \nindigenous population. Many scholars suggest that such violence \nconforms to other 20th-century categories of analysis, like settler \ncolonial genocide and crimes against humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSand Creek, Bear River and the Long Walk remain important parts of \nthe Civil War and of American history. But in our popular narrative, \nthe Civil War obscures such campaigns against American Indians. In \nfact, the war made such violence possible: The paltry Union Army of \n1858, before its wartime expansion, could not have attacked, let \nalone removed, the fortified Navajo communities in the Four Corners, \nwhile Southern secession gave a powerful impetus to expand American \nterritory westward. Territorial leaders like Evans were given more \nresources and power to negotiate with, and fight against, powerful \nWestern tribes like the Shoshone, Cheyenne, Lakota and Comanche. The \nviolence of this time was fueled partly by the lust for power by \ncivilian and military leaders desperate to obtain glory and wartime \nrecognition.\u0014\n\u0014\nExpansion continued after the war, powered by a revived American \neconomy but also by a new spirit of national purpose, a sense that \nAmerica, having suffered in the war, now had the right to conquer \nmore peoples and territories.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States has yet to fully recognize the violent destruction \nwrought against indigenous peoples by the Civil War and the Union \nArmy. Connor and Evans have cities, monuments and plaques in their \nhonor, as well as two universities and even Colorados Mount Evans, \nhome to the highest paved road in North America.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaturdays 150th anniversary will be commemorated many ways: The \nNational Park Services Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site, the \ndescendant Cheyenne and Arapaho communities, other Native American \ncommunity members and their non-Native supporters will commemorate \nthe massacre. An annual memorial run will trace the route of \nChivingtons troops from Sand Creek to Denver, where an evening vigil \nwill be held Dec. 2.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe University of Denver and Northwestern are also reckoning with \nthis legacy, creating committees that have recognized Evanss \nculpability. Like many academic institutions, both are deliberating \nhow to expand Native American studies and student service programs. \nYet the near-absence of Native American faculty members, \nadministrators and courses reflects their continued failure to take \nmore than partial steps.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the government has made efforts to recognize individual \natrocities, it has a long way to go toward recognizing how deeply the \ndecades-long campaign of eradication ran, let alone recognizing how, \nin the face of such violence, Native American nations and their \ncultures have survived. Few Americans know of the violence of this \ntime, let alone the subsequent violation of Indian treaties, of \nreservation boundaries and of Indian families by government actions, \nincluding the half-century of forced removal of Indian children to \nboarding schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne symbolic but necessary first step would be a National Day of \nIndigenous Remembrance and Survival, perhaps on Nov. 29, the \nanniversary of Sand Creek. Another would be commemorative memorials, \nnot only in Denver and Evanston but in Washington, too. We \ncommemorate discovery and expansion with Columbus Day and the \nGateway arch, but nowhere is there national recognition of the people \nwho suffered from those achievements  and have survived amid \ncontinuing cycles of colonialism.\u0014\n\u0014\nCorrection: November 27, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the \nAmerican Indian leader Black Kettle was killed in the Sand Creek \nMassacre. He died at the Battle of Washita in Oklahoma in 1868.\u0014\n\u0014\nNed Blackhawk, a professor of history and American studies at Yale \nand the coordinator of the Yale Group for the Study of Native \nAmerica, is the author of Violence Over the Land: Indians and \nEmpires in the Early American West.\u0014",

    "title": "ROBERT BARCLAY, CHAMPION OF QUAKER THINKING",
    "words": "Robert Barclay made Quaker thinking logically defensible when the \nmovement was only about a quarter of a century old. Some think he \nsaved it from extinction. Up till that time, although it had won a \nfew notable converts (among them William Penn, Isaac Penington, \nThomas Ellwood and a number of businessmen) it had mostly attracted \npersons of little stature and a disproportionate number of delusional \nindividuals and lunatics. Some of these paraded stark naked through \ntown \"as a witness\" and entered traditional churches in undress to \nwarn of the wrath to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert himself, although greatly mortified by the exercise, felt \ncompelled to walk through Aberdeen once, dressed in sackcloth with \nashes on his head. He explained in a published letter how he had felt \nconstrained by God, as a prophet of old, to do this. It was the only \ntime he acted in such a manner.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day, December 23, 1648, Robert received four years of \ntraining in Paris where a wealthy uncle offered to make him his heir \nif only he would join the Roman Church. Meanwhile, Robert's father, \nDavid Barclay, had become a Quaker. His dying wife made him promise \nto bring Robert home, which David did, personally fetching him from \nFrance. The boy was soon won to his father's convictions. Scholarly \nfrom his youth up, he became the theologian of the Quaker viewpoint. \nHis was not merely a bookish faith however; he went to prison several \ntimes because he was a Quaker.\u0014\n \u0014\nBarclay argued that the only real Christianity is that in which the \nSpirit of Christ is present. Since the Bible must be interpreted and \nbrought alive by the Holy Spirit, even its words are secondary to \ninner illumination. Any merely historical or liturgical faith is \ndead. Any worship which lacks Christ's presence is a sham. Faith must \nbe something experienced.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpiritual-minded men do behold the glory and beauty of God, in \nrespect whereof and for which all the glory of this world is \ndespicable to them; yea, even as dross and dung. And they also hear \nGod inwardly speaking in their souls words truly divine and heavenly, \nfull of virtue and divine life; and they savour the taste of divine \nthings, and do as it were handle them with the hands of their souls. \nAnd those heavenly enjoyments do as really differ in thier nature \nfrom all false similitudes and fictitious appearances of them, which \neither the mind of man by its own strength can imitate, or any evil \nspirit to deceive man counterfeit; as a true man differs from the \ndead image of a man; or true bread, honey, wine or milk doth differ \nfrom a mere picture of those things.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Apology for the True Christian Divinity has undergirded Quaker \nthinking ever since it was penned. One Scotsman declared that Barclay \nwas the only great original theologian that Scotland ever produced. \nHowever, his influence was not through his theology alone. In his own \nage, he was active in national affairs and negotiated in behalf of \nKing James II. When he died at the young age of 42, he had fathered \nnine children. His offspring were ardent Quakers, and their \ndescendants were prominent among the famous Quaker families of \nsubsequent centuries: the Barclays, Gurneys and Frys. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarclay, Robert.

    "words": "But prayer still a regular part of many lives, even if few have a use \nfor worship \u0014\n\u0014\nBy The Washington Post   3/7/15   WASHINGTON - \u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. religion is on the ropes, but it has a prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\nA record-low share of Americans attend church regularly, affiliate \u0014\nwith a religious faith and see themselves as religious, according to \na \u0014\nmajor survey released this week. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe findings mark a continuation of a decadeslong departure from \u0014\nthe pews along with a growing share who profess loyalty to no \nreligion at \u0014\nall. But whatever Americans' hang-ups with weekend services and de- \u0014\nnominational ties, they haven't stopped praying on their own. \u0014\n\u0014\nFully 57 percent of respondents said they pray at least once a day, \nlit- \u0014\ntie different from 54 percent in 1983, when the question was first \nasked \u0014\non the survey. Three-quarters of respondents said they pray at least \u0014\nonce a week, while 1 in 4 pray less often or never. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe national survey is the broadest study of attitudes in the United \u0014\nStates. The stability of prayer contrasts sharply with erosion on \nother \u0014\nmeasures of religious commitment. Since 2006, the percentage of \npeople \u0014\ndescribing themselves as \"very\" or \"moderately\" religious has \ndeclined \u0014\nfrom 62 percent to 54 percent. The share affiliating with a \nparticular \u0014\nfaith has fallen from over 90 percent in the 1980s and 1990s to 79 \npercent\u0014\nin 2014. Just over 4 in 10 report attending worship services at least \u0014\nonce a month, down roughly 10 points from three decades ago. All \u0014\nare record lows.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe resilience of prayer reflects a broader shift in Americans' \nunder- \u0014\nstanding of religion, according to Christian Smith, a professor of \nso- \u0014\nciology who leads the University of Notre Dame's Center for the Study \u0014\nof Religion and Society. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe General Social Survey was funded primarily by the National \u0014\nScience Foundation and conducted through interviews with a random \u0014\nsample of2,538 adults from March 31 to Oct. 13.

    "title": "ROBERT SCHULLER, FOUNDER OF CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL, DIES",
    "words": "ARTESIA, Calif. (AP) 4/2/15 The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, the \nSouthern California televangelist and author who beamed his upbeat \nmessages on faith and redemption to millions from his landmark \nCrystal Cathedral only to see his empire crumble in his waning years, \nhas died. He was 88.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller died early Thursday at a care facility in Artesia, daughter \nCarol Schuller Milner said. In 2013, Schuller was diagnosed with a \ntumor in his esophagus that had spread to his lymph nodes and began \ntreatment.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce a charismatic and well-known presence on the televangelist \ncircuit, Schuller faded from view in recent years after watching his \nchurch collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp \ndeclines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the \nministry to file for bankruptcy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe soaring, glass-paned Crystal Cathedral  the touchstone of \nSchuller's storied ministry  was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese \nof Orange in 2011, and Schuller lost a legal battle the following \nyear to collect more than $5 million from his former ministry for \nclaims of copyright infringement and breach of contract.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller, who preached in a flowing purple robe and outsized aviator \nglasses, suffered a mild heart attack in 1997 but was quickly back on \nthe pulpit, saying \"the positive person\" is not afraid of life's \nsurprises. In July 2013, he was hospitalized for days after a \nlate-night fall at his home in Orange.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller's evangelical Protestant ministry, part of the Reformed \nChurch in America, was a product of modern technology. He and his \nlate wife, Arvella, an organist, started a ministry in 1955 with $500 \nwhen he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a \ndrive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church's motto  \"Come as you are in the family car\"  tapped \ninto the burgeoning Southern California auto culture and the suburban \nboom of post-World War II America.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1961, the church had a brick-and-mortar home  a \"walk-in/drive-in \nchurch\"  and Schuller began broadcasting the \"Hour of Power\" in 1970.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1980, he built the towering glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral to \nhouse his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week \nfrom the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary. At its \npeak, in the 1990s, the program had 20 million viewers in about 180 \ncountries.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller's message  that \"Possibility Thinking\" and love of God \novercome hardships  was a uniquely American blend of Bible and \npsychology. It was inspired by late author Norman Vincent Peale, who \nwrote \"The Power of Positive Thinking.\" Schuller also wrote more than \n30 books, including several best-sellers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a young guy like me, and he was going out there and trying \nnew things,\" said his grandson, Bobby Schuller, who pastors his own \nchurch that includes some of his grandfather's former congregants. \n\"He did so many amazing, innovative things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike other televangelists, the senior Schuller's message lacked \nfire-and-brimstone condemnations or conservative political baggage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The classical error of historical Christianity is that we have never \nstarted with the value of the person. Rather, we have started from \nthe 'unworthiness of the sinner,' and that starting point has set the \nstage for the glorification of human shame in Christian theology,\" he \nwrote in his book \"Self-Esteem: The New Reformation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller had admirers that ranged from fellow evangelist Billy Graham \nto Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He also \nwas among the first foreign religious figures invited to preach on \nRussian television.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalists attacked him as a heretic and humanist for statements \nthey believed denied the need for personal repentance of sin and for \nhis tolerance of Jewish, Roman Catholic and other theologies.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis friendship with President Bill Clinton raised some eyebrows among \nthe conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and \nprompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response, Schuller gave a sermon on tolerance.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do let people know how great their sins and miseries are,\" he said \nin a 1992 radio interview. \"I don't do that by standing in a pulpit \nand telling them they're sinners. ...The way I do it is ask \nquestions. Are you happy? Do you have problems, what are they? So \nthen I come across as somebody who cares about them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSchuller sometimes cited the example of his daughter Carol, who lost \npart of her leg because of a motorcycle accident in 1978 but went on \nto become a champion skier.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When tough times come, we need to take tough action, to hold on \nuntil the tide turns for the better, to tenaciously dig in and bloom \nwhere we are planted,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nTough times were in store for Schuller, too.\u0014\nIn 2006, Schuller's only son, 51-year-old Robert A. Schuller, was \ninstalled as senior pastor, the start of a carefully choreographed \nleadership transition. Although a father-son succession is rare in \nthe Reformed Church in America, the Schullers considered the church a \n\"family business\" and the move was sanctioned by the national church, \nofficials said.\u0014\nBut the organization fell on difficult times after the younger \nSchuller's installation, and he left amid a bitter family feud in \nfall 2008. His father had removed him from the \"Hour of Power\" \nbroadcasts, and he quit as senior pastor a few weeks later.\u0014\nSheila Schuller Coleman, one of Schuller's daughters, took over as \nthe church's top administrator, and a stable of preachers, including \nher and her father, handled preaching duties on the \"Hour of Power.\"\u0014\nShe, too, ultimately left, taking some congregants with her to start \na new ministry.\u0014\nThe tumult in the pulpit worsened a pre-existing decline in \nviewership and donations, and in 2010, Crystal Cathedral ministries \nfiled for bankruptcy, citing debt of more than $43 million.\u0014\nBankruptcy filings indicated the ministry was paying significant \ntax-exempt housing allowances to Schuller family members and \ninsiders. The allowances were legal but raised concerns among vendors \nand other creditors who had gone unpaid for months.\u0014\nIn 2012, Schuller and his wife quit the board of directors in a \ndispute over copyright infringement and breach of contract. That same \nyear, they lost a legal bid to recover more than $5 million from \ntheir former ministry.\u0014\nSchuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller, took the remaining congregation \nand founded a new church. Bobby Schuller also took over the \"Hour of \nPower,\" broadcasting from a new location.\u0014\nRobert Harold Schuller was born in Alton, Iowa, in 1926, and was \nordained by the Reformed Church in America in 1950. He was pastor of \nIvanhoe Reformed Church in Chicago from 1950 to 1955 before moving to \nCalifornia.\u0014\nBesides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, \nSheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, \n2014, after a brief illness.\u0014",

Banks |        Religion News Service |     Wednesday, April \n08, 2015 \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\n4 Notable Remarks from President Obamas Easter Prayer Breakfast\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Obama turned both personal and preachy Tuesday (April 7) \nduring his annual Easter Prayer Breakfast, which he has hosted at the \nWhite House six times since he was elected. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe long list of Christian leaders attending included Sojourners Jim \nWallis, National Association of Evangelicals President Leith \nAnderson, Roman Catholic Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Rev. Al Sharpton, \nretired Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson, civil rights veteran the Rev. \nC.T. Vivian and African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Vashti McKenzie. \nThe Rev. Amy Butler of New Yorks Riverside Church gave the opening \nprayer. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere are four memorable statements from the event: \u0014\n\u0014\n1. Though he said, I am no preacher, he almost preached: \u0014\n\u0014\nEven as we grapple with the sheer enormity of Jesus sacrifice, on \nEaster we cant lose sight of the fact that the story didnt end on \nFriday, he said. The story keeps on going. On Sunday comes the \nglorious resurrection of our savior. \u0014\n\u0014\nEaster is our affirmation that there are better days ahead  and \nalso a reminder that it is on us, the living, to make them so, he \nadded. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. He acknowledged he falls short of the mark: \u0014\n\u0014\nToday we celebrate the magnificent glory of our risen savior. I pray \nthat we will live up to his example. I pray that I will live up to \nhis example. I fall short so often. Every day I try to do better. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. He praised several preachers, including the late Rev. Gardner C. \nTaylor: \u0014\n\u0014\nHe quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and acknowledged Pope \nFrancis, whom he will welcome to the White House later this year and \nwho encourages us to seek peace, to serve the marginalized and be \ngood stewards of Gods creation. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he remembered the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, the dean of American \npreaching, who died on Easter Sunday at age 96.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian Headlines.com\u0014",

    "title": "READING THE MAN -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Elizabeth Brown Pryor and her extraordinary new book, Reading The \nMan, has single-handedly revived what was hitherto unrevivable. She \nhas made Robert E. Lee come to life in a way that no other writer has \never been able to do and she has done it in a way that should make \nevery other biographer of Lee blush: she has let the man speak for \nhimself and she has done it through new research. Yes, new research. \nCertainly much of the new material she has uncovered has been locked \naway in trunks for almost a century so other researchers including \nFreeman had no access to it. But some of what she's used has been \navailable to researchers for decades they just chose not to look. \nIntellectual laziness? Or have researchers just been content with \nwhat they've had? Fortunately, Elizabeth Pryor was neither lazy nor \ncontent and what she has constructed is a masterpiece of biographical \nexamination. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lee that springs from her pages is dynamic and emotional, \nconflicted and complex, playful and loving and nothing like he has \never been portrayed before. But the magic of this work, what truly \nelevates it beyond mere interpretation into what can only be \ndescribed as revolutionary, is how Ms. Pryor manages to be both \ncritical and sympathetic with her subject. With Lee it has always \nbeen you either revere or revile him. There has been no middle \nground. Those that simplified him to the point of mere symbolism \ninsured that. He was either the Christ like martyr of the Lost Cause \nor the white supremacist Benedict Arnold of the Civil War. But \nElizabeth Pryor has shown us, has proven beyond reproach, that you \ncan be critical of someone and still like him. You can point out his \nflaws but empathize with his humanity. You can be honest without \ndefilement. What Ms. Pryor has done for all of us interested in \nhistory, the Civil War and Robert E. Lee is incalculable. She has, \nquite literally, shown us a new way to examine our common history and \ntruly learn from it.  We would be fools not to follow her.\u0014\n-----\u0014\nHaving read a couple of reviews in the \"main stream\" print media that \nappeared to celebrate this book's exposure of Robert E. Lee's true \nsentiments about slavery (e.g., the Philadelphia Inquirer's review \nfocused ad nauseum on the most negative report of Lee's ordered \nwhipping of a captured runaway slave), I relunctantly bought this \nbook (from Amazon, of course), fearful that this would prove to be \nyet another exercise in political correction by a less-than-objective \nhistorian.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nReading it, however, revealed something altogether different -- Lee \nwas a man of his times (high society in the antbellum south, 19th \nCentury) and also a real and very moral man, who focused more on the \npractical than the theoretical.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is not to say that the author, Elizabeth Pryor Brown, sought to \ntry prove that Robert E. Lee wasn't the icon that he is held to be, \neven to this day, in many parts and in many hearts of the South. She \ndramatized the presence of a whipping post for errant slaves, with \nlittle proof that it was ever used. But as is often the case with \nhistorians who delve deeply into their subjects, her heart was \ntouched the humanity, grace and character of Lee, through a thorough \nand scintillating read of private letters that had been locked away \nin a bank vault for more than a century.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThings I learned in the book: He was a mega-flirt, but never \nunfaithful to or threatened by his strong-willed, secure and \nrelatively independent wife. He loved the company of others, \nparticularly his fellow soldiers and officers. None of three \ndaughters ever married. He was confident yet humble,loved his family, \nand had a tireless devotion to duty, both an an engineer and a \nsoldier.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHe, not unlike almost anyone who has ever served in the military, \nexpressed his share of frustrations with the military life, and even \nshowed a little jealousy when peers were promoted ahead of him (but \nalso showing that he was not particularly adept at, or fond of, \npolitics). Except, possibly, for his flirtations, apparently done \nwith the full knowledge of Mary Lee, none of this would be a surprise \nto any devotee or student of the General.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book is very well written; it is fair and balanced, and gives \nmore time and attention to Lee, the man, than Lee the general or even \nthe soldier. The book was a joy to read and very hard to put down, \neven for a historical tome, with difficult to understand reprints of \nentire letters by Lee and members of his family and a bit too much \nink on Harry \"Light Horse\" Lee, Robert's heroic but badly flawed and \nlargely absent father. Her final chapter, and its final words, are \nwonderfully insightful at answering an important question -- why, \nafter all these years, are we stil fascinated by this lengdary man? \nThis book is a wonderful achievement and a worthy read.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNo minds will likely be changed about Lee, whether you're a son of \nthe South or South-hating liberal yankee who will be disappointed \nthat Lee isn't thorough demystified. The careful and thoughtful \nreader will come away with greater appreciation and respect for the \nman.\u0014\n\u0014\n-----\u0014\nFor those who wish to have a good look at the life of Robert E. Lee \nin one volume, this is the book to use as a basic biography and \nguide. Author Elizabeth Brown Pryor has taken letters written by Lee \nas the springboard for each of the chapters of the book, \ncorresponding with the chapters in his life. This gives the reader a \nchance to read and sense the tone of the celebrated General, in his \nown words. Surely, this was not an easy task since there are about \n10,000 known letters of Robert E. Lee scattered hither and yon. To \nfind, read and cull the best of these must have been both Herculean \nand painstaking. One suspects it has also been a labor of love.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThose with the sketchiest knowledge of Lee will remember that his \nfather was a Revolutionary War era hero, that he had an almost \nunparalleled record as a West Point cadet, that he married into the \nCustis and therefore Washington family, making him not only one of \nthe First Families of Virginia but also of the First Family of \nAmerica. Of course best known is Lee's choice to side with state and \nkindred during the Civil War and the resultant verve and \ndisappointment on the field of battle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this 200th birthday anniversary year, Pryor fleshes out these \nfacts with a nuanced portrait of a complex man whose personal and \nprofessional life are not as easily summarized as one might suppose. \nDealing with those who came before her who served as Lee's uncritical \nbiographers, Pryor demythologizes Lee in a respectful way, allowing \nhim to be not only three dimensional but also multifaceted. She also \ngives an outstanding prcis of aspects of the Lee hagiography and \nmisconceptions that have persisted through repetition. It would be \ncorrect to call Pryor's approach even-handed. She clearly appreciates \nthat Lee was a towering figure in his time; she also allows the \nreader to see his eccentricities.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book is excellent on some challenging subjects such as Lee's \nattitude toward slavery and how it compares to the attitudes of his \ncontemporaries. Pryor also gives us an account of Lee's unabashed \naffection for women. The chapter on Lee's tenure as head of West \nPoint speaks volumes about how Lee was perceived by those who \nobserved him as a professional soldier preparing others to be \nprofessional soldiers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author's description of what went right and what went wrong at \nsome of the key battles of the war, notably Gettysburg, are well \ndone, and will provide both the general reader and the Civil War \nexpert good starting points for conversation. Even so, I must confess \nthat the second part of the book was for me slower-going than the \nfirst half. Whether that is due to Lee, Pryor or me, I am not sure. \nNor am I sure what to conclude about Robert E. Lee--a man of honor \n(rightly placed or mis-placed), of brilliance (and obstinacy) in \npeace and in war, and a man who took a road less traveled by which \nmade all the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book has many fine illustrations scattered throughout the text, \nincluding many portraits and photographs of Lee from youth to old age.\u0014",

    "words": "Challenging the Shame of Being Poor \u0014\nRupen Das     May 14, 2015   EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nA worldview that dominates Middle Eastern societies is one of honor \nand shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll interactions and conversations either honor a person or shame \nthem in the way they are addressed and treated socially.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne's standing in the community may be one of honor or shame based on \ntheir position, wealth and influence, and whether they are able to \nfulfill their social obligations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to understand why Jesus honored the poor and shamed the rich \nwho hoarded their wealth, it is important to know the economic \nstructure of first-century Palestine where wealth and resources were \nlimited.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to New Testament scholars Bruce Malina and Richard \nRohrbaugh, the concept of \"limited good\" is the key to understanding \nthe dynamics of wealth and poverty and the attitudes toward the \nwealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern economies operate on the basis of unlimited supplies of \nresources and commodities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there is a shortage, more can be produced. So if one person got \nmore of anything, it did not automatically mean that another person \ngot less.\u0014\n\u0014\nMalina and Rohrbaugh explain the very different reality of \nfirst-century Palestine, which was based on \"limited good\" and where \n\"all goods existed in finite, limited supply and all goods were \nalready distributed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Because the pie could not grow larger, a larger piece for anyone \nautomatically meant a smaller piece for someone else. Profit making \nand the acquisition of wealth were automatically assumed to be the \nresult of extortion or fraud,\" they said. \"To be labeled 'rich' was \ntherefore a social and moral statement as much as an economic one. It \nmeant having the power or capacity to take from someone weaker what \nwas rightfully his.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe economic situation of the peasantry was precarious due to \nsubsistence-level farming and the expenses for taxes, rents and seed \nas well as the threat of natural disasters and famine.\u0014\n\u0014\nFarmers also were subjected to blackmail, bullying and overtaxation \n(see Luke 3:13-14); any emergencies such as accidents, ill health and \ncrop failure forced the poor into debt and borrowing money at \nexorbitant rates.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they failed to repay the loans, they would not only lose their \nland but also could also be enslaved or imprisoned (see Matthew \n5:25-26).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result, most of the peasants in the rural areas did not have any \nsurplus and were poor and destitute.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to understand the social impact of poverty in \nfirst-century Palestine and in much of the majority world today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lack of wealth and influence - and being unable to fulfill one's \nsocial and religious obligations - resulted in shame so the poor were \nnot treated as a normal part of society. They were thus marginalized \nand ignored.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus uses this paradigm of honor and shame to teach how God treats \nthe poor and how he abhors the rich who hoard their wealth and ignore \nthe needs of the desperate around them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the parable of Lazarus and the rich man (Luke 16:19-31), Jesus \ngoes against the cultural norm by honoring Lazarus, who was not only \npoor but also a beggar who had nothing and no social standing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poor man is named, while Jesus leaves the rich man anonymous and \nwithout lasting honor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy giving Lazarus a name, Jesus identifies him as a unique individual \nand not just as one of the poor who hide in shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the parable, the name that Jesus pointedly chooses for the beggar \nis Lazarus, which is derived from Eleazar in Hebrew, meaning \"one \nwhom God has helped.\" This parable reveals the heart of God for the \npoor and the broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poor are not just an anonymous category on a socioeconomic scale. \nEach of them has a name with their own dreams and struggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy acknowledging their name, they become human, even though they may \nbe vulnerable and in desperate need. Because they have a name, it \nchallenges us to acknowledge their existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the parable, neither man is a great sinner. Lazarus is not accused \nof being lazy or being of poor moral character. The rich man is not \ncondemned for being rich, but for not being concerned for the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that his concern remains only for his family and never \nfor those who are not part of his social circle. He excludes the \noutsider as not being worthy of his attention and care.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' parable challenges this prevailing attitude that a family's \nand tribe's only concern should be for their own, to the exclusion of \nall others.\u0014\n\\\u0002Rupen Das is consultant for mission and development at the European \nBaptist Federation based in Amsterdam\u0014",

    "title": "REFLECTING ON THE BALTIMORE RIOTS",
    "words": "New York Times 5/4/15 The \nUpshot\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on the earnings records of millions of families that moved with \nchildren, it finds that poor children who grow up in some cities and \ntowns have sharply better odds of escaping poverty than similar poor \nchildren elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe feelings heard across Baltimore's recent protests  of being \ntrapped in poverty  seem to be backed up by the new data. Among the \nnation's 100 largest counties, the one where children face the worst \nodds of escaping poverty is the city of Baltimore, the study found.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe city is especially harsh for boys: Low-income boys who grew up \nthere in recent decades make roughly 25 percent less as adults than \nsimilar low-income boys who were born in the city and moved as small \nchildren to an average place.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond Baltimore, economists say the study offers perhaps the most \ndetailed portrait yet of upward mobility  and the lack of it. The \nfindings suggest that geography does not merely separate rich from \npoor but also plays a large role in determining which poor children \nachieve the so-called American dream.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow neighborhoods affect children has been a quandary with which \nsocial science has been grappling for decades, said David B. Grusky, \ndirector of the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Stanford \nUniversity, who was not involved in the research. This delivers the \nmost compelling evidence yet that neighborhoods matter in a really \nbig way.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaj Chetty, one of the study's authors, has presented the findings to \nmembers of the Obama administration, as well as to Hillary Rodham \nClinton and Jeb Bush, both of whom have signaled that mobility will \nbe central themes of their 2016 presidential campaigns. After more \nthan 15 years of mostly mediocre economic growth and rising income \ninequality, many families say they are frustrated and anxious about \ntrying to get ahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe data shows we can do something about upward mobility, said Mr. \nChetty, a Harvard professor, who conducted the main study along with \nNathaniel Hendren, also a Harvard economist. Every extra year of \nchildhood spent in a better neighborhood seems to matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe places where poor children face the worst odds include some  but \nnot all  of the nation's largest urban areas, like Atlanta; Chicago; \nLos Angeles; Milwaukee; Orlando, West Palm Beach and Tampa in \nFlorida; Austin, Tex.; the Bronx; and the parts of Manhattan with \nlow-income neighborhoods.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll else equal, low-income boys who grow up in such areas earn about \n35 percent less on average than otherwise similar low-income children \nwho grow up in the best areas for mobility. For girls, the gap is \ncloser to 25 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe places most conducive to upward mobility include large cities  \nSan Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Providence, \nR.I.  and major suburban counties, such as Fairfax, Va.; Bergen, \nN.J.; Bucks, Pa.; Macomb, Mich.; Worcester, Mass.; and Contra Costa, \nCalif.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese places tend to share several traits, Mr. Hendren said. They \nhave elementary schools with higher test scores, a higher share of \ntwo-parent families, greater levels of involvement in civic and \nreligious groups and more residential integration of affluent, \nmiddle-class and poor families.\u0014",

Among those captives were the \nJews. They returned to Judah with authority to rebuild their temple. \nSeventeen years later, construction still languished, and God raised \nup the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to rebuke the neglect of his \nhouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 520 Haggai preached \"Is it time for you to live in your paneled \nhouses while this house lies in ruin?\" Through Haggai, the Lord asked \nthe Jews how they had fared since their return. \"You have sown much \nand harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, \nbut you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is \nwarm; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with \nholes\" (Haggai 1:6, Revised Standard Version). Haggai said God wanted \nthem to bring wood and rebuild His house.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudah's political and religious leaders listened. Under their \nleadership, the remnant of exiles who had returned to Israel rebuilt \nGod's house, which was completed on this day, March 12, 515 BC But it \nwasn't much to look at.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it not in your sight as nothing?\" the Lord asked them. Well, they \nshould not think that way. God's Spirit was with them. And a day was \ncoming when the Lord would shake Heaven and earth, the sea and the \ndry land. \"I will fill this house with splendor,\" God promised. \"The \nlatter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former,\" said \nthe Lord. \"From this day on, I will bless you,\" he promised.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe temple, rebuilt in 515 BC, was rebuilt yet again by Herod the \nGreat, who restored it in stone and covered it with gold. It was that \ntemple that Christ visited in his life, bringing it glory. A \ngeneration after Christ's death and resurrection, Herod's temple was \ncast down by the Romans. A mosque now stands on its platform.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaggai also prophesied that all the nations would bring their \ntreasures to the temple. That event has not been fulfilled.

    "title": "RESPONDING RIGHTLY TO WRONG CRITICISM",
    "words": "Responding Rightly to Wrong Criticism\u0014\nBy Craig Thompson \u0014\n\u0014\nCriticism. As a pastor you know that you have to expect criticism and \nlearn to deal with it, but that can be easier said than done. \nCriticism comes in all shapes and sizes and some of it is easier to \nshrug off than others. For instance, when a senior adult woman told \nme my pants were too tight and made it difficult to focus on the \nsermon, my wife and I got a good laugh.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of it is difficult to gauge. Are the trustees really concerned \nabout the grass or are they questioning my leadership and decision \nmaking?\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes criticism is impossible to respond to, especially if it \ncomes third or fourth person, Some people are unhappy with the \nnursery.\u0014\n\u0014\nOccasionally criticism hits too close to home. Pastor, a senior \nadult lady in the church says, weve noticed that your wife doesnt \nattend our circle group each month. Our last pastors wife ALWAYS \nattended circle group.\u0014\n\u0014\nI even once had a visitor to our church send me an anonymous letter \ncomplaining that I turned around and spoke to the choir too much \nduring my preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some tips from the Proverbs that have helped me.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe Slow to Anger (Proverbs 16:32). My pride jumps to my defense and I \nwant to respond in anger to those who criticize me. The biblical \nresponse is to wait. Be slow to anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnswer Softly (Proverbs 15:1). I like a good fight, but that is \nrarely a good spiritual strength. Our goal as pastors is to shepherd \nand good shepherding means keeping the flock unified and healthy, A \nsoft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. The \nway you respond to criticism can do much to either quiet it or stir \nit up even more.\u0014\n\u0014\nLook for advice (Proverbs 12:15). Sometimes the critics speak truth, \neven if they do not speak it well. If you do not know how to answer \ncriticism or even if it rightly applies to you, look for advice. The \nway of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to \nadvice.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the source (Proverbs 27:6). Not all evaluation is wrong or \nbad, Faithful are wounds of a friend. Even though this article is \nabout responding to wrong criticism, not all criticism is wrong. The \ncoaching I receive from those who love me works to sharpen me up \n(Proverbs 27:17), even if their rebukes are stinging at times.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the source again (Proverbs 29:11). Not all criticism should \nbe taken to heart, A fool gives full vent to his spirit. Some \npeople talk all of the time, they gossip, complain, and criticize. \nTheir words should be considered with less weight than others.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarefully consider your response (Proverbs 26:4-5). Not every critic \ndeserves a response or the same kind of response, Answer not a fool \naccording to his folly, lest you be like him yourself. Answer a fool \naccording to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. In other \nwords, be careful not to get caught up in endless drivel at the feet \nof fools. If a response is necessary, respond in such a way as to \nexpose their folly, not to engage in endless quarrels.\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBERING NICHOLAS FERRAR",
    "words": "Nicholas Ferrar lived only 45 years, but they were some of the most \nunselfish years any man has given the world. His wealthy parents were \ndeeply committed to the Church of England and reared their children \nin faith. They required each to memorize large portions of Scripture. \nEvery day, they read to them from Foxe's Book of Martyrs. From his \nbirth in 1592 until his premature death, these influences remained \nstrong in Nicholas. At six he had an overwhelming religious \nexperience in which he yielded his heart to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nNicholas learned quickly and studied hard, wasting few opportunities. \nIn his early teens, he went up to Cambridge, where he continued to \npour himself into study. So brilliant was he that his tutor prayed he \nwouldn't turn heretic, because with his power as a thinker and \nwriter, orthodox churchmen would be hard-pressed to answer him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFerrar didn't turn from the faith. Forced by ill-health to travel \nabroad, he continued his studies. Everywhere he went, he studied \narts, methods of manufacture, and languages. Everyone thought he was \nplanning some great career for himself. A princess with whom he \ntraveled asked him to become her secretary. He turned down her offer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether he would survive to show the world what was in him, was \ndoubtful. Crossing German mountains, he was almost killed when a \ndonkey ran down a slope carrying a large piece of timber which almost \nstruck Nicholas. All that saved him was that the donkey slipped. The \nwood barely tapped Nicholas, who would otherwise have been flung over \na precipice. In Padua and later in Marseilles, he fell ill of such \nsevere fevers that doctors despaired of his life. Sailing to Spain, \nhis ship was approached by Turkish pirates, who would probably have \ncaptured them, if a bigger prize hadn't swum into view. Crossing \nSpain, he barely escaped bandits and other threats to his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Spain he was summoned home. The family had fallen on hard times \nand needed him. Nicholas played a prominent part in saving the \nVirginia company whose affairs had entangled the family fortune. \nNicholas mastered the business. King Charles I's council, looking for \nan excuse to destroy the company, demanded a report on such short \nnotice they thought no reply could be given. Nicholas parceled out \nthe work between several people; and by all working several days on \ntwo hours sleep a day, the huge report was made.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy similar hard work, he restored his family finances and won a place \nin Parliament. But Nicholas was tired of the world. When he had set \nout on his travels, he promised God to devote his life to Him if he \nreturned safely. Now he took steps to keep that promise. He formed a \nProtestant community and had Archbishop Laud ordain him as a deacon \nso that he could lead worship services. This move was seen as a great \nrenunciation by all who knew his capabilities. About thirty friends \nand family joined him. They lived strictly, eating little, but \npraying and singing at set hours. They offered education and medicine \nto the locals. Nicholas wrote and translated; and the whole community \nbound books.\u0014\n\u0014\nNicholas died in 1637, declaring \"I have been at a great feast, the \nGreat King's feast.\" Ten years later, the Puritans drove his \ncommunity away, burning the church organ and destroying Nicholas' \nwritings. They labeled Little Giddings an Arminian Nunnery and said \nit threatened a return to Catholicism. He is remembered in the \nAnglican church on this day, December 1.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ferrar, Nicholas.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, \nedited by F. L.

    "words": "Remembering Ann Judson 190 Years Later\u0014\n                                October 24, 2016 by Michael A. G. \nHaykin.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             A Remarkable Woman\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorian David S. Schaff, son of the famous historian Phillip \nSchaff, was surely right when he noted that the name of Ann \nHasseltine Judson (17891826) is one of the immortal names in \nmissionary biography.1 Francis Wayland (17961865), the major \nnineteenth-century biographer of Anns husband, said after he spent \ntime with her in 1822: I do not remember ever to have met a more \nremarkable woman. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith her husband Adoniram Judson (17881850) she was the first of a \nlong line of American evangelical missionaries. In fact, her embrace, \nand that of her husband, in 1812 of Baptist principles is one of the \nkey turning points in the history of the American Baptists: it marked \nthis communitys entry into the modern missionary movement, an event \nsealed two years later by the formation of the Triennial Convention, \nso called because it met every three years. Moreover, Anns life \nstory was repeated innumerable times in the nineteenth and twentieth \ncenturiesalmost every year between 1830 and 1856 there was a new \nedition of her biography, which prompted one author, Lydia Maria \nChild, to describe it as a book . . . universally known.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, she became, along with her husband and others such as William \nCarey (17611834) and Hudson Taylor (18321905), a key source of \ninspiration for the modern missionary movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Extraordinary Letter\u0014\n\u0014\nOn June 28, 1810, Adoniram Judson, Ann's future husband, came for \nlunch at her parents home with three other students, all \nCongregationalists and all of whom had offered themselves to serve as \nmissionaries with their body of churches under the auspices of what \nwas called the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. \nThey would be the first overseas American missionaries. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost immediately Adoniram was smitten by Anns vivacity, charm, and \nbeauty, and a month later he formally asked her in a letter if she \nwould consent to have him court her. She replied that he must secure \nher fathers permission. So it was, in July of 1810, that Adoniram \nsent her father one of the most extraordinary letters from a \nprospective son-in-law: \u0014\n\u0014\nI have now to ask whether you can consent to part with your daughter \nearly next spring, to see her no more in this world? Whether you can \nconsent to her departure to a heathen land, and her subjection to the \nhardships and sufferings of a missionary life? Whether you can \nconsent to her exposure to the dangers of the ocean; to the fatal \ninfluence of the southern climate of India; to every kind of want and \ndistress; to degradation, insult, persecution, and perhaps a violent \ndeath? Can you consent to all this, for the sake of Him who left His \nheavenly home and died for her and for you; for the sake of \nperishing, immortal souls; for the sake of Zion and the glory of God? \nCan you consent to all this, in hope of soon meeting your daughter in \nthe world of glory, with a crown of righteousness brightened by the \nacclamations of praise which shall resound to her Saviour from the \nheathens saved, through her means, from eternal woe and despair?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnns parents, John and Rebecca Hasseltine, allowed Ann to decide for \nherself. For her part, Ann was not able to answer Adoniram \nimmediately. First, she barely knew him. And then she realized that \nto marry Adoniram was to commit herself to a missionary vocation, and \nshe was not initially sure this was what God wanted for her life. For \ntwo months she wrestled with her feelings, her love for her family, \nand her dread of suffering alone in a foreign land. Finally, although \nmany of her friends and acquaintances deemed her decision to leave \nAmerica a wild, romantic undertaking, she came to the conclusion \nthat marriage to Judson and a missionary life was indeed Gods will \nfor her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout twenty months later, on February 5, 1812, Ann and Adoniram were \nmarried in the Hasseltine home where they had first met. The very \nnext day was the ordination of Adoniram in Tabernacle \nCongregationalist Church in Salem along with three other \nCongregationalist missionaries for service in the Indian \nsubcontinent. Two thousand crowded into the meetinghouse. A hush \npervaded the crowd until the moment of ordination, when a wave of \nweeping and sighing swept through the congregation. Within two weeks \nthe missionaries had all set sail for India.\u0014\n\u0014\nOff to India\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, the British East India Company, which had a mandate to rule \nBritish possessions in the subcontinent, was intensely hostile toward \nmissionaries in India. The only way that the Serampore TrioCarey, \nWard, and Marshmanhad been able to stay was by residing in the \nDanish colony of Serampore. Thus, within ten days of the Judsons \narrival in India, they were ordered by the company to leave the \ncountry. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the providence of God they were ultimately led to Burma, reaching \nRangoon on July 13, 1813. Burma lay then between China and India, \nhemmed in by mountains on both borders. It was an empire governed by \na despotic emperor who ruled by fear. Corruption within the \ngovernment was endemic, and the laws were cruel. Torture and mass \nexecutions were routine and kept the population subservient to their \nrulers. The religion of the Burmese was Buddhism, which Ann rightly \ndescribed thus: \u0014\n\u0014\nThe religion of Burmah, then, is, in effect, atheism; and the highest \nreward of piety, the object of earnest desire and unwearied pursuit, \nis annihilation. How wretched a system is this; how devoid of \nadequate motives to virtue; and how vacant of consolation!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnn and Adoniram lived in Rangoon for ten years, from 1813 to 1823, \ndealing with persecution and various hardships. During this time both \nof them mastered the language, though this feat did not come without \nmuch perseverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy December 1815, Ann was telling her sisters in America that she and \nAdoniram feel quite at home, and can converse with ease on common \nsubjects. She felt that she was Adonirams equal in speaking the \nlanguage; but when it came to reading and writing she was far \nbehind her husband. What they specially found to be a challenge was \nconversation about the things of God on account of the want of \nreligious terms in their language. It is noteworthy that Adoniram \nrefrained from preaching until he had a good grasp of the language \nand had translated some of the Scriptures into Burmese.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer Last Words Were in Burmese\u0014\n\u0014\nIn late 1821 Ann decided to return to America for a period of time, \nowing to a severe problem with her liver. It was a difficult decision \nto leave Burma and also Adoniram, but it was necessary for the \nrecovery of her health. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnn went via England and finally arrived in America on September 25, \n1822. Her health was not sufficiently recovered when she decided to \nmake the return trip to Rangoon by way of Calcutta on June 22, 1823. \nShe arrived in Calcutta in mid-October 1823, and was advised not to \nproceed to Burma, as war seemed imminent between Great Britain and \nBurma. But Ann was eager to see Adoniram, so in November she sailed \nfor Rangoon, arriving on December 5, 1823. She had been gone two \nyears and four months in total, and the last letter Adoniram had had \nfrom her had been thirteen months before her return! \u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately upon her return Adoniram and Ann moved to the royal \ncapital of Ava. Within a couple of months of their arrival, the First \nAnglo-Burmese War (18241826) broke out. It was to be the first of \nthree wars fought between the British and the Burmese Empire during \nthe course of the nineteenth century. The war, which began primarily \nover the control of northeastern India, ended in a decisive British \nvictory and was the longest and most expensive war in British Indian \nhistory. Fifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together \nwith an unknown number of Burmese military and civilian casualties. \nMoreover, the war cost the British between five and thirteen million \npounds of sterling (roughly 18.5 billion to 48 billion in \ncontemporary US dollars). \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Judsons were Americans, all Westerners became suspect, \nand Adoniram was imprisoned under horrific conditions. Ann literally \nsaved his life by pleading with government officials to let him live, \nby daily taking food to him in the prison, and by relentlessly \npressuring the government authorities throughout the course of the \nwar to free him. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo sooner, though, than Adoniram was released in 1826, Ann fell sick, \nexhausted by this time of stress, persecution, and the burden of \nmanaging things without her husbands help. She died on October 24, \n1826, her last words being uttered in Burmese, the tongue of the \npeople she had grown to love.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotes:\u0014\n\u0014\nCited in Leslie K.

    "title": "RICHARD NIXON--THE LIFE       A BROOK REVIEW",
    "words": "History buffs rejoice; the definitive Nixon biography is here. John \nA. Farrell is the renowned biographer of Clarence Darrow. Now he \ngives us a comprehensive, compelling look at the only US president \never to resign from office under the cloud of imminent impeachment. \nThis is the only Nixon biography that answers the many questions that \nleft Americansand those around the world that were \nwatchingscratching our heads. Why, why, and why would he do these \nthings? Farrell tells us. I read this book free and in advance, \nthanks to Net Galley and Doubleday, but it would have been worth \npaying the full retail price if Id had to. Its available to the \npublic now.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnytime I read nonfiction, I start with the sources. If the author \nhasnt verified his information using primary sources, I go no \nfurther. Nonfiction is only fact if the author can prove that what he \nsays is trueand I have never seen more meticulous, more thorough \nsource work than what I see here. Every tape in the Nixon library; \nevery memoir, from Nixons own, to those of the men that advised him \nas president, to those written by his family members, to those that \nopposed him are referenced, and thats not all. Every set of \npresidential papers from Eisenhower on forward; the memoirs of LBJ, \nthe president that served before Nixon took office; reminiscences of \nBrezhnev, leader of Russia ( which at the time was part of the USSR); \nreminiscences of Chinese leaders that hosted him; every single \nrelevant source has been scoured and referenced in methodical, \ncareful, painstaking detail. Farrell backs up every single fact in \nhis book with multiple, sometimes a dozen excellent sources.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he has been so diligent, hes also been able to take down \nsome myths that were starting to gain a foothold in our national \nnarrative. An example is the assertion that before the Kennedys \nunleashed their bag of dirty tricks on Nixons campaign in 1960, \nNixon was a man of sound principle and strong ethics. A good hard \nlook at his political campaigns in California knocks the legs out \nfrom under that fledgling bit of lore and knock it outs it out of the \nnest, and out of the atmosphere. Gone!\u0014\n\u0014\nLest I lend the impression that this is a biography useful only to \nthe most careful students of history, folks willing to slog endlessly \nthrough excruciating detail, let me be perfectly clear: the man \nwrites in a way that is hugely engaging and at times funny enough to \nleave me gasping for air. Although I taught American history and \ngovernment for a long time, I also learned a great deal, not just \nabout Nixon and those around him, but bits and pieces of American \nhistory that are relevant to the story but that dont pop up anywhere \nelse.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those that have wondered why such a clearly intelligent \npolitician, one that would win by a landslide, would hoist his own \npetard by authoring and authorizing plans to break into the offices \nof opponentsand their physiciansthis is your book. For those that \nwant to know what Nixon knew and when he knew it, this is for you, \ntoo.\u0014\n\u0014\nI find myself mesmerized by the mental snapshots Farrell evokes: a \ntormented Nixon, still determined not to yield, pounding on the piano \nlate into the night. I hear the clink of ice cubes in the background \nas Nixon, talking about Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, \nsuggests that The Indians needwhat they really needis a mass \nfamine.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can see Kissinger and the Pentagon making last minute arrangements \nto deal with a possible 11th hour military coup before Nixon leaves \noffice. Dont leave him with the button during those last 24 hours, \nthey figure.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I picture poor Pat, his longsuffering wife to whom he told \nnothing, nothing, nothing, packing all through the night before they \nare to leave the White Housebecause of course he didnt tell her \nthey were going home in time to let her pack during normal hours.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most damning and enlightening facts have to do with Vietnam and \nparticularly, Cambodia. Farrell makes a case that the entire horrific \nHolocaust there with the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot could have been \navoided had Nixon not contacted the Vietnamese ambassador and \nsuggested that he not make a deal with Johnson to end the war.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether you are like I am, a person that reads every Watergate memoir \nthat you can obtain free or cheaply, or whether you are a younger \nperson that has never gone into that dark tunnel, this is the book to \nread. Its thorough and its fair, and whats more, its entertaining.\u0014",

    "title": "REASONS SOME DON'T WANT THEIR CHURCH TO GROW",
    "words": "Most church members do desire to see their churches growuntil the \ngrowth affects them. It is at that point they can become \ndisillusioned and critical.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what is it about growth that impacts some members negatively? Let \nme suggest seven reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of familiarity. When a church is growing, it becomes a different \nchurch over time. The difference is not necessarily good or bad, but \nits not the same as it was in earlier years. Some church members \ngrieve when they see their churches change. They miss the good old \ndays.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of memories. I recently heard a poignant story from a lady whose \nchurch was demolishing the old worship center to build a new one to \naccommodate growth. She and her husband were married in the old \nworship center. She understandably grieved at the loss of that \nphysical reminder of their wedding.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of comfort. Growth can mean that the closest parking spots are \nno longer available. Growth can mean that the traffic flow in the \nparking lot is more difficult. Church members can feel that their \ncreature comforts are compromised by growth.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of power. New people in a church can mean that power bases are \ndiluted. The growth can result in new influencers in the church. Some \nof the longer-tenured influencers may not like that.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of perceived intimacy. Its a common response: I used to know \neveryone in this church. I just dont feel as close to members as I \nonce did. Indeed, growth can mean that all the members may not know \neach other as they did when the church was smaller.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of worship style. New members and attendees might have different \nworship style preferences. They often influence church leaders to \nmake changes. Existing members may resent these changes. They might \nalso start worship wars.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of worship time. Growth in the church may necessitate adding \nworship services or changing times of worship services. Some members \nmay be frustrated that they have lost their worship time.\u0014\n\u0014\nObedience to the Great Commission often results in growth in the \nchurch. But growth in the church is not always received well by some \nmembers. Some of these members have an attitude that the church is \nthere to serve them and to cater to their needs. Healthy church \nmembers understand they are to be giving and sacrificial members of \nthe body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12).\u0014",

Chickasaw and Choctaw from Mississippi, \nCreek from Alabama, Seminole from Florida, and Cherokee from Georgia, \nSouth Carolina and North Carolina, as well as mixed race and freed \nslaves were moved west under guard of various authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo do this, a Supreme Court ruling was ignored. Laws and treaties \nwere broken. Legitimate authorities yielded to public pressure. \nPresident Andrew Jackson attempted to justify this injustice, \nsuggesting this action was in thebest interest of the displaced \ntribes.

    "words": "Read the Bible \ncritically before you read it spiritually\u0014\n                                                                    \nChuck Queen | September 13, 2017\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Sundays Gospel reading in the Revised Common Lectionary \n(Matthew 18:21-25) is a good example of why a critical reading of the \ntext is so important. It is a reminder that we are not reading an \ninfallible text. The biblical writers could be just as biased, \nprejudiced, judgmental and petty as we are. I cannot emphasize enough \nhow important it is to read the biblical text, not just spiritually \nand devotionally, but also critically and historically.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is extremely unfortunate that most lay Christians are not taught \nhow to read a text critically or why its even important. In this \nregard many clergy have failed their congregations. Of course, some \nclergy have never been taught themselves the importance of reading a \ntext critically. On the other hand, some clergy know what they need \nto teach their congregations, but they are afraid to do it. They \nthink their parishioners cant handle it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts important for lay Christians to know that these stories didnt \ndrop down out of heaven on the wings of angels. Its important for \nthem to know that the stories (parables) and teachings of Jesus, as \nwell as the stories about Jesus that constitute our New Testament \nGospels, were told and retold many times by word of mouth (this is \ncalled the oral tradition) before they were ever written down. And it \nis equally important for them to know that the Gospel writers who \nincorporated these stories into a basic narrative of the ministry of \nJesus also edited these stories adapting and altering them to fit \ntheir framework and emphases.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts quite possible our Gospel writers had several versions of these \nstories to choose from, or maybe just one  we dont know. What we do \nknow is that they added some things, left out some things, and \nchanged some things in the stories to fit their purpose (the \ntechnical term for this is redaction). Scholars who study these \nthings make observations about the unique characteristics of each \nGospel writer. Actually, you dont have to be a scholar to engage in \nthis kind of study of the text. All you have to do is be willing to \ncompare the Gospel stories, give attention to the details, and make \nnote of the repeated emphases and characteristics of that particular \nauthor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the text for this Sunday Jesus tells a story that highlights the \nunlimited and outrageous nature of Gods forgiveness. An official \nserving in a kings court incurs a huge debt through the \nmismanagement of the kings resources. The debt is beyond anything \npossible. Jesus had a real penchant for employing hyperbolic and \nshocking elements in his stories to get his point across. Ten \nthousand talents is an unrealistic number. One talent was equal to \nthe wages of a manual laborer for 15 years. The annual tax for all of \nHerods territories was 900 talents per year. The point here is that \na debt was incurred that was impossible to pay back. The servant \nfinds himself in a hopeless situation. But here is where the good \nnews is such good news. Astonishingly, the king does the \nunconventional, outlandish thing. He forgives the debt. Certainly the \nkings actions are meant to reflect the actions of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, the servant also does an unthinkable, outlandish thing. \nHaving been forgiven an unpayable debt, instead of responding in \ngratitude by extending the same forgiveness to one indebted to him, \nhe demands the debtor pay him the hundred denarii (a denarii was the \naverage daily wage of a manual laborer) owed him. This was a sizeable \ndebt, but nothing like the unpayable debt that was cancelled by the \nking. How unlike the king is the servant of the king! How \noutlandishly generous is the king and how ungratefully demanding and \nvindictive is the servant. The contrast couldnt be clearer.\u0014\n\u0014\nA critical reading of the text sees verses 32-33 as the logical \nconclusion to the story where the king says to his servant: You \nunjust servant! I forgave you all that debt because you asked for \nmercy. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had \non you? The careful reader can recall a similar conclusion to Jesus \ninstruction to love ones enemies in Matthew 5:44-48. There Jesus \ninstructs the disciples to love their enemies, to pray for them and \ndo good to them because then they will be like their Father in \nheaven, who sends blessings (rain and sunshine) on the just and \nunjust alike. He concludes by saying: Be perfect [be mature, \ncompete, spiritual], therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. \nGod doesnt torture Gods enemies. God sends blessings on Gods \nenemies. And because we are the sons and daughters of God, we are \ninstructed to do the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere in this passage (Matt. 5) we have the same (though inverted) \nconclusion about outlandish forgiveness as we find in the parable in \nMatthew 18. God loves Gods enemies, therefore we are to love our \nenemies. God dispenses unlimited and outlandish forgiveness, \ntherefore, we are to forgive likewise. So the story ends right?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, it doesnt. Heres where a critical reading is so important. The \ntext continues in verses 34-35: And in anger his lord handed him \nover to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt [that would be \nforever, since the debt was unpayable]. So my heavenly Father will \nalso do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or \nsister from your heart. You dont need a seminary degree to \nrecognize the clear contradiction here. The king takes back his \nunlimited forgiveness and responds vindictively punishing forever the \nservant who failed to practice the forgiveness he received.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have no doubt Matthew added this to the original parable. Scholars \nwould call this a Matthean embellishment. In lay terms you could \nsay Matthew has an ax to grind. Matthew, like all of us, struggles \nwith the unlimited, outlandish forgiveness of God. We like to claim \nit for ourselves. But we have a hard time dispensing it to others. So \nwhile Matthews embellishment distorts the nature of Gods \nforgiveness and character, contradicting the teaching of Jesus he \ngave us in chapter 5, what it does do is invite us to struggle with \nGods outlandish forgiveness ourselves and our own tendencies toward \nanger, our struggle with vindictive desires for retribution, and our \nown unwillingness to forgive others as we have been forgiven.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also invites us to seriously consider what judgment might await \nthose who fail to practice the forgiveness they themselves have \nreceived. Matthews redaction/embellishment/addition to the parable \nraises that question. We should be able to discern from Jesus \nteachings elsewhere (such as Matt. 5) and his own experience of God \nas Abba that the Abba of Jesus would not torture anyone. We should be \nable to apply common sense and reason to the overall portrait Matthew \npaints of Jesus and realize that God would never abandon anyone. \nMatthew apparently would like for that to happen, as some Christians \nI know would as well, but the God of Jesus would never abandon \nanyone. Common sense teaches us that. Would any of us ever abandon a \nchild or grandchild? There is nothing a child or grandchild of mine \ncould ever do that would cause me to stop loving, hoping and praying \nfor his or her restoration and redemption. Surely God loves Gods \nwayward children at least as much as I would love mine or you would \nlove yours. Common sense interpretation, intuition and reason tell us \nthat Matthews addition in verses 34-35 cannot possibly be an \naccurate reflection of God. Whatever Gods judgment might involve or \nhowever painful it might be it would surely be for the purpose of \nrestoration, not retribution. Matthews redaction (his adding his own \nwords to the story he received in his tradition) does not accurately \nreflect God, but what it does do is invite us into serious reflection \nand awareness of our own tendencies toward unforgiveness and \nretribution, which are so unlike our Father/Mother in heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout this critical reading of the text one might draw unwarranted \nand foolish spiritual and practical applications from Matthews \nembellishment in verses 34-35. One might conclude that God is the \nkind of God who can give forgiveness one minute and take it back the \nnext. One might conclude that one could actually do something to \nmerit eternal damnation without any hope of redemption. One might use \na text like this to turn God into a petty, punitive Ruler rather than \nthe loving Abba that God is. Without a critical reading of the text, \none may engage in spiritual misuse and abuse of the text.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy challenge to all ministers reading this piece is this: Face your \nfears, put in the work, and teach your people how to read scripture \ncritically. The spiritual health and transformation of the sheep in \nyour flock depend on it\u0014",

    "title": "RED WORD AND BLACK  WORD CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "RED WORD AND BLACK WORD CHRISTIANS [Sat 1-27-18]\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently I heard an Assemblies of God pastor from Louisville \ninterviewed on TV. The occasion was an upcoming Sunday at his church \ncalled, if I remember correctly, Open Carry Sunday, for which \npeople were invited to bring their loaded guns [yes, loaded was \nspecified] to church. The invitation poster shown on TV had several \nphrases like They wont take our guns away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe interviewer asked if this were not contrary to Christian \ntheology. The pastor replied in a quite reasonable way along these \nlines: Pacifism is not the only Christian tradition. For instance, \nturn the other cheek might be more a matter of dealing with \ndishonor than with personal protection. We believe in the whole \nBible, the Old Testament as well as the New. We believe that God \ncovenanted in this way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he said specifically, We do not live by the red words alone.\u0014\n           \u0014\nThe red words, of course, are the words of Jesus in the red-letter \neditions of the New Testament.\u0014\n           \u0014\nWe notice first the end result of the difference between Christians \ncalled conservative or evangelical and those called liberal or \nprogressivea 90 to 180 degree difference on social concerns such \nas abortion, homosexuality, guns, taxes-economy, poverty, AIDS, war, \ntorture. How can people who read the same Bible and claim the same \nChrist come to such different conclusions?\u0014\n           \u0014\nThe answer, I think, is that we do not claim the same Christ. Most \nconservative Christians are really not Christ-ians; they are \nBiblians. Christ-ians believe in Christ as the full and only \nnecessary revelation of God, continued through the Holy Spirit. \nBiblians believe in the Bible as the full and only necessary \nrevelation of God.\u0014\n           \u0014\nBiblians believe that the black words of the Bible have equal \nrevelatory quality with the red words. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not new, of course. [1] Many churches have advertised \nthemselves for a long time as Full Bible churches, meaning the \nblack words have equal weight with the red words. It is what Hans \nFrei referred to as the eclipse of Biblical narrative.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblians are basically anti-narrative. There is no movement in the \nBible, except in claiming that Christianity has superseded Judaism. \nJerry Falwell used to say that Jesus wrote every word of the Bible. \nThat means that it is not Gods story book, a narrative culminating \nin the ministry of Jesus and the resurrection of Christ, but Gods \nrule book, where any rule at any point in the book has the same \nweight as any other rule. Destroy all the inhabitants of that place \nis equal to Love your neighbor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Martin Luther first proclaimed scripture only as the guide for \nChristians, he specifically disavowed creating a paper pope. He \nwanted NO pope, no overlord authority. Thats why he proclaimed the \npriesthood of all believers. Any Christian was on equal footing with \nthe priests in interpreting Scripture. The purpose of the Bible was \nnot to replace the pope and the priests as overlords for \nChristiansreplace the Roman pope with a paper pope--but to allow \nevery Christian a place in the ongoing story of Gods salvation, \nguided by Gods Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity and Biblianity are two different faiths.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblians are somewhere between Jews and Christians, trying to live by \nboth Jewish Law and Christian grace, by black words and red words \nequally. [2] Thats really quite impossible unless you have an ex \ncathedra authoritarian pope of some kind that cuts off discussion, \nlike the bumper sticker I used to see, The Bible says it. I believe \nit. That settles it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am sure, however, that Biblians will never call themselves that. \nThey, of course, have every right to call themselves Christians, but \nI would like to be able to distinguish myself from that sort of \nChristianity. I guess Ill just have to say that I am a red word \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nJRMcF\u0014\njohnrobertmcfarland@gmail.com\u0014\n\u0014\n1] The growing and now huge chasm between Christians called \nconservative or evangelical and those called first mainline and \nmore recently liberal or progressive started with the \nfundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s, featuring most \nprominently J. Gresham Machen for the Fundamentalists vs. Harry \nEmerson Fosdick for the liberals.\u0014\n\u0014\n2] Like when the Cubs had [Mark] Grace playing first base and [Vance] \nLaw playing third. You cant win if you are caught between Grace and \nLaw.\u0014",

    "title": "REFORMER PHILIP MELANCHTHON",
    "words": "Reformer Philip Melanchthon\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a red letter day in the history of the Reformation. On this \nday, February 16, 1497 was born a man of peace into an age of \nconflict, a reasoner into a world of passion. His birth name was \nPhilip Schwarzerd, \"Black earth,\" which in Latin is \"Melanchthon.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt ten Philip was orphaned. His grandmother took him in. Melanchthon \nproved an apt scholar, entering the University of Heidelberg at \ntwelve. In two years he graduated with his bachelors degree. He \nproceeded to tutor while adding to his store of Greek. Soon afterward \nhe entered Tbingen where he received his masters degree. When he \ngraduated, the twenty-one-year old was awarded a position as \nProfessor of Greek at Wittenberg through the influence of his grand \nuncle, the famed humanist, Reuchlin. After a cool reception, he \nimpressed Luther and the schoolmen with his inaugural speech in which \nhe called for thorough-going reform of the curriculum. Martin Luther \nhad already posted his 95 theses and was stirring the Christian world.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon himself was ripe for reform. Having read Erasmus' Greek \nTestament, he, like Luther, was convinced salvation must be by faith \nrather than by works. He united his talent with Luther's and, in \npublic dispute, bested Luther's chief opponent, Johann von Eck. Not \ncontent to argue orally, Melanchthon defended his position in \nwriting. With careful reasoning he clarified what the Reformation was \nall about. Others characterized him as the brains behind it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he was a peaceable man, Melanchthon was the natural person \nfor Luther to ask to prepare a statement to deliver to Emperor \nCharles V who had summoned the German Diet to settle the nation's \nreligious differences. Melanchthon's statement was conciliatory. The \nfirst twenty-one points emphasized doctrines on which both sides were \nlargely agreed. In the last seven points he addressed those issues on \nwhich he felt Catholics had varied from scriptural authority. The key \npoint of the document was that justification of the soul is by faith \nalone. It became known as the Augsburg Confession and remains the \nbasic statement of Lutheran doctrine. Rome rejected it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon continued to strive for a formulation which would be \nacceptable to all sides. He did not want the church divided. But his \nvoice of reason was lost in the roar of the day. Because he would not \naccept Luther's vehement position on the Sacrament, the great \nreformer turned on his quiet friend and blasted him mercilessly. On \nhis death bed Luther felt remorse for this. \"Dear Philip, I confess \nto have gone too far in the affair of the Sacrament.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon lived several years after Luther died, steadily teaching \nat Wittenberg, but ignored by the radicals who too often headed the \nProtestant movement. In the end his quiet soul longed for death as a \nway to escape the \"frenzy of theologians.\" Nonetheless his Augsburg \nConfession remained one of the few grounds mutually respected by the \nquarreling reformers. However, he himself was vilified as a \ncompromiser and neglected for 200 years after his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH-- A FUNDAMENTALIST VIEW",
    "words": "Rapture of the Church.-- A \nFUNDAMENTALIST VIEW\u0014\n\u0014\nA phrase premillennialists* use to refer to the \"catching up\" (from \nLatin rapio) of the church to be with Christ at his Second Coming. \nAll premillennialists trace the doctrine to the same passage (1 Thess \n4:15-17) but disagree on when it will occur in relation to the \ntribulation period, which they identify as the \"seventieth week\" of \nDaniel 9:24-27. Historically, premillennialists have divided over \nwhether the rapture will happen before, during or after the \ntribulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nPretribulationism, which is nearly identical with dispensationalism,* \nargues that the rapture will occur before the tribulation. Though \npretribulationists try to find the teaching throughout church \nhistory, in about 1830 John Nelson Darby* was the first to divide the \nSecond Coming into two stages: Christ's coming for his saints before \nthe tribulation (the rapture) and his coming with his saints after it \n(the Second Coming per se). This view was derived from his total \ndistinction between the church and Israel: The church must be removed \nfrom the earth before God can resume his dealings with the Jews and \nfulfil the prophecies concerning the end times.\u0014\n\u0014\nPretribulationists find evidence for their view in Paul's teaching \nthat before Antichrist can be revealed, the \"restrainer,\" which they \ntake as either the church or the Holy Spirit, must be removed (2 \nThess 2:6-8); the fact that the church is not mentioned in the \neschatological predictions of the Book of Revelation after chapter 3, \nindicating that the church must have been raptured; and the biblical \nwarning that the rapture is imminent, which means that no prophesied \nevent stands between the present and the coming of Christ for his \nsaints. This view gained ascendancy in American premillennial circles \nbefore World War 1,* thanks in large part to The Scofield Reference \nBible* (1909), and continues to the present in Hal Lindsey's \nbest-selling The Late Great Planet Earth (1970).\u0014\n\u0014\nMidtribulationism, an alternative view, contends that the church will \nbe raptured halfway through the tribulation. This view, championed by \nHarold J. Ockenga,* Gleason L. Archer and others, became popular \namong a relatively small number of premillennialists after World War \n2.* Midtribulationalists believe that the frequent mention of \nforty-two months in key prophetic passages (e.g., Dan 7, 9, and 12; \nRev 11 and 12) indicates that only half of Daniel's seventieth week \n(three and a half years) will experience the terror usually \nassociated with the entire tribulation period (Rev 16-18). In the \nfirst half of the seventieth week, the church will remain on earth, \nwitnessing the rise of Antichrist, and experiencing persecution at \nhis hand; but it will be raptured by Christ before God's judgment and \nwrath are poured out. Advocates claim that their view remedies \npretribulationism's shortcomings, which include its insistence that \nthe rapture will be \"secret\" and its inability to locate the rapture \nin the Olivet Discourse (Mt 24). Nevertheless, midtribulationism \nstill divides the Second Coming into two phases.\u0014\n\u0014\nPosttribulationism, which appears to be the oldest premillennialist \nview, holds that the rapture and the Second Coming of Christ will \noccur at the same time, at the end of the tribulation. \nPosttribulationists argue that no scriptural text explicitly divides \nthe Second Coming into two parts. Paul's most explicit passage on the \nrapture (1 Thess 4) does not mention its time relationship to the \ntribulation; but its accompanying phenomena (loud command, trumpet of \nGod, gathering of the saints by angels, Christ coming on the clouds) \nare mentioned in other passages which do place them after the \ntribulation (Mt 24, Mk 13, Lk 21). Thus advocates of this view expect \nthe church to go through the tribulation, suffering terrible \npersecution, but not experiencing the wrath of God because of divine \nprotection (Rev 7). In order to come to these conclusions, \nposttribulationists generally play down the distinction between \nIsrael and the church and the imminence of the rapture. Though \neclipsed by pretribulationism before World War 1,* this view has \ngained many followers since World War 2 through the writings George \nLadd,* Robert Gundry and others.\u0014\n\u0014\nA small number of pretribulationists, led by G. H. Lang, have also \nargued for a partial rapture theory which contends that only the most \nfaithful Christians will be raptured before the tribulation, with the \nrest being caught up sometime later, depending on their spiritual \ncondition.\u0014\nThough such interpretive disagreements may seem inconsequential to \noutsiders, differences over the timing of the rapture have often \nproduced fierce antagonism among premillennialists, with advocates of \none view refusing to associate with those of another.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography.

    "title": "RABBINIC JUDAISM",
    "words": "Written and oral law\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbinic Judaism is distinguished by belief in Moses as \"our Rabbi\" \nand that God revealed the Torah in two parts, as both the Written and \nthe Oral Torah, also known as the Mishnah.[2] All the laws in the \nWritten Torah are recorded only as part of a narrative describing God \nimparting these laws to Moses and commanding him to transmit them to \nthe Jewish nation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Talmud contains discussions and opinions regarding details of \nmany oral laws believed to have originally been transmitted to Moses. \nSome see Exodus 18 and Numbers 11 as a display of Moses' appointing \nelders as judges to govern with him and judge disputes, imparting to \nthem details and guidance of how to interpret the laws of God while \ncarrying out their duties.[citation needed] The Oral Torah includes \nrules intended to prevent violations of the laws of the Torah and \nTalmud, sometimes referred to as \"a fence around the Torah\". For \nexample, the written Torah prohibits certain types of traveling on \nthe Sabbath; consequently, the Oral Torah prohibits walking great \ndistances on the Sabbath to ensure that one does not accidentally \nengage in a type of traveling prohibited by the written Torah. \nSimilarly, the written Torah prohibits plowing on the Sabbath; the \nOral Torah prohibits carrying a stick on the Sabbath to ensure that \none does not drag the stick and accidentally engage in prohibited \nplowing. \u0014\n\u0014\n Origins of Rabbinic Judaism\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the rabbis were required to face a new reality, that of Judaism \nwithout a Temple (to serve as the center of teaching and study) and \nJudea without autonomy, there was a flurry of legal discourse and the \nold system of oral scholarship could not be maintained. It is during \nthis period that rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in \nwriting.[3] The theory that the destruction of the Temple and \nsubsequent upheaval led to the committing of Oral Law into writing \nwas first explained in the Epistle of Sherira Gaon and often repeated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oral law was subsequently codified in the Mishnah and Gemara, and \nis interpreted in rabbinic literature detailing subsequent rabbinic \ndecisions and writings. Rabbinic Jewish literature is predicated on \nthe belief that the Torah cannot be properly understood without \nrecourse to the Oral Law. It states that many commandments and \nstipulations contained in the Torah would be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to keep without the Oral Law to define themfor example, \nthe prohibition to do any \"creative work\" (\"melakha\") on the Sabbath, \nwhich is given no definition in the Torah, is given a practical \nmeaning by a definition of what constitutes 'Melacha' provided by the \nOral Law. Numerous examples exist of this general prohibitive \nlanguage in the Torah (such as, \"don't steal\", without defining what \nis considered theft, or ownership and property laws), \nrequiringaccording to rabbinic thoughta subsequent definition \nthrough the Oral Law. Thus Rabbinic Judaism claims that almost all \ndirectives, both positive and negative, in the Torah are non-specific \nin nature and require the existence of either an Oral Law, or some \nother method to explain them.[citation needed] \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch rabbinic Jewish literature concerns specifying what behavior is \nsanctioned by the law; this body of interpretations is called halakha \n(the way).\u0014",

The right to \nmaintain slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey also attempted to reframe their aggressive stand for slavery as \nan impassioned response to Northern attempts to control the long-held \nSouthern way of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost Cause proponents did this by reframing the myths, symbols and \nrituals related to Southern life and the Confederacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myths they propagated were:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat the South was a place primarily focused on nobility and chivalry \nand not on building an economy that was driven by the use of Black \nbodies.\u0014\nThat the enslavement of Black people was a noble cause because it \nprovided these savages the opportunity to become Christianized.\u0014\nThat white-dominated society was a primary part of Gods intentions \nfor the nation, as evidenced through the idea of manifest destiny.\u0014\nThe symbols they protected were the Confederate flag (which struck \nimmediate fear in Black people), plantation life (which had as its \nfoundation the unpaid and often severely punished service of Black \nbodies) and the Bible (serving as the ultimate source of power and \ncontrol over those Black bodies).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a Black person was not willing to obey their masters as the Bible \ncommanded, then they had no hope for Gods earthly protection or \nheavenly home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rituals prolonged by the Lost Cause were the active resubjugation \n(reincarceration) of Blacks under the guise that Blacks were not able \nto take care of themselves, were prone to criminality and, therefore, \ndid not deserve their freedom, and that slavery was an inherent good \nfor them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother equally emphasized ritual was that not only should Blacks \nserve whites, but that women should serve men, and that the poor \nshould serve the wealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Reconstruction ended in 1877, Lost Cause proponents had \neffectively succeeded in initiating their plan to reframe their \noriginal intentions and to adopt a position as victims to unrighteous \nNorthern interference.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, this playbook has been updated for the 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are people who lead our nation and churches today who are \nattempting to hinder the full inclusion of people who they have \ndeemed as not fitting their image of what good Americans look like.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey seek to do so by:\u0014\n\u0014\nReframing those who do good for the poor and outcast as anti-American.\u0014\nHolding on to racist symbols from the past and framing opposition to \nthose symbols as heretical and standing against tradition, which in \nthe Lost Cause is always more important than doing good.\u0014\nUsing the Bible as a convenient tool even when what the Bible teaches \nstands in direct opposition to what is being done.\u0014\nPitting people against each other by framing one side as undeserving \nof Gods full love through the use of fear.\u0014\nThe irony of this is that God does not call us to be good Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod calls us to be good followers of Jesus even when that means we \nfind ourselves on the opposite side of political, social and economic \npowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrell Carter, DMin, is a pastor and administrator in higher \neducation residing in St. Louis, Missouri.\u0014",

It is unutterable. O my \nfriends, how good is God!\" The day he died, he was calling, \"Come, \nLord Jesus, come quickly!\" He told his friends that he could not live \nmuch longer for no mortal man could live after seeing the glories of \nGod that he had seen. He was not quite thirty-eight when he died on \nthis day, august 11, 1778, but his short life-span was enough to \nproduce one of the most beloved of all hymns--Rock of Ages:\u0014\n\u0014\nRock of Ages cleft for me,\u0014\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\u0014\nLet the water and the blood\u0014\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed\u0014\nBe of sin the double cure;\u0014\nCleanse me from its guilt and power.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is said to have come to him when he stepped into a cleft of \nrock to take shelter from a storm, but the evidence does not bear \nthis out. The first appearance of that particular story was 70 years \nafter his death. More likely the hymn came from his meditation on God \nas our rock, which was a frequent theme in his sermons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew if any today read the the sermons or other books Augustus Toplady \nwrote, but we still sing his hymn. It has remained a favorite. Sung \nin churches or at home, it speaks of Christ's mercy to all ages.\u0014",

    "title": "ROBOTS ARE RAPIDLY REPLACING JOBS THAT WON'T BE BACK",
    "words": "Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the PandemicAnd Robots and \nAI Are Replacing Them Faster Than Ever\u0014\n\u0014\n ALANA SEMUELS AUGUST 6, 2020  TIME MAG.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor 23 years, Larry Collins worked in a booth on the Carquinez Bridge \nin the San Francisco Bay Area, collecting tolls. The fare changed \nover time, from a few bucks to $6, but the basics of the job stayed \nthe same: Collins would make change, answer questions, give \ndirections and greet commuters. Sometimes, youre the first person \nthat people see in the morning, says Collins, and that human \ninteraction can spark a lot of conversation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one day in mid-March, as confirmed cases of the coronavirus were \nskyrocketing, Collins supervisor called and told him not to come \ninto work the next day. The tollbooths were closing to protect the \nhealth of drivers and of toll collectors. Going forward, drivers \nwould pay bridge tolls automatically via FasTrak tags mounted on \ntheir windshields or would receive bills sent to the address linked \nto their license plate. Collins job was disappearing, as were the \njobs of around 185 other toll collectors at bridges in Northern \nCalifornia, all to be replaced by technology.\u0014\n\u0014\nMachines have made jobs obsolete for centuries. The spinning jenny \nreplaced weavers, buttons displaced elevator operators, and the \nInternet drove travel agencies out of business. One study estimates \nthat about 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. factories \nfrom 1990 to 2007. But the drive to replace humans with machinery is \naccelerating as companies struggle to avoid workplace infections of \nCOVID-19 and to keep operating costs low. The U.S. shed around 40 \nmillion jobs at the peak of the pandemic, and while some have come \nback, some will never return. One group of economists estimates that \n42% of the jobs lost are gone forever.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis replacement of humans with machines may pick up more speed in \ncoming months as companies move from survival mode to figuring out \nhow to operate while the pandemic drags on. Robots could replace as \nmany as 2 million more workers in manufacturing alone by 2025, \naccording to a recent paper by economists at MIT and Boston \nUniversity. This pandemic has created a very strong incentive to \nautomate the work of human beings, says Daniel Susskind, a fellow in \neconomics at Balliol College, University of Oxford, and the author of \nA World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should \nRespond. Machines dont fall ill, they dont need to isolate to \nprotect peers, they dont need to take time off work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deployment of robots as a response to the coronavirus was rapid. \nThey were suddenly cleaning floors at airports and taking peoples \ntemperatures. Hospitals and universities deployed Sally, a \nsalad-making robot created by tech company Chowbotics, to replace \ndining-hall employees; malls and stadiums bought Knightscope \nsecurity-guard robots to patrol empty real estate; companies that \nmanufacture in-demand supplies like hospital beds and cotton swabs \nturned to industrial robot supplier Yaskawa America to help increase \nproduction.\u0014\n\u0014\nCompanies closed call centers employing human customer-service agents \nand turned to chatbots created by technology company LivePerson or to \nAI platform Watson Assistant. I really think this is a new \nnormalthe pandemic accelerated what was going to happen anyway, \nsays Rob Thomas, senior vice president of cloud and data platform at \nIBM, which deploys Watson. Roughly 100 new clients started using the \nsoftware from March to June.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat doesnt mean theyre taking everyones jobs. For centuries, \nhumans from weavers to mill workers have worried that advances in \ntechnology would create a world without work, and thats never proved \ntrue. ATMs did not immediately decrease the number of bank tellers, \nfor instance. They actually led to more teller jobs as consumers, \nlured by the convenience of cash machines, began visiting banks more \noften. Banks opened more branches and hired tellers to handle tasks \nthat are beyond the capacity of ATMs. Without technological \nadvancement, much of the American workforce would be toiling away on \nfarms, which accounted for 31% of U.S. jobs in 1910 and now account \nfor less than 1%.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the past, when automation eliminated jobs, companies created \nnew ones to meet their needs. Manufacturers that were able to produce \nmore goods using machines, for example, needed clerks to ship the \ngoods and marketers to reach additional customers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, as automation lets companies do more with fewer people, \nsuccessful companies dont need as many workers. The most valuable \ncompany in the U.S. in 1964, AT&T, had 758,611 employees; the most \nvaluable company today, Apple, has around 137,000 employees. Though \ntodays big companies make billions of dollars, they share that \nincome with fewer employees, and more of their profit goes to \nshareholders. Look at the business model of Google, Facebook, \nNetflix. Theyre not in the business of creating new tasks for \nhumans, says Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist who studies automation \nand jobs.\u0014",

    "title": "ROGER WILLIAMS - SEPARATION  OF CHURCH AND STATE",
    "words": "In the film Reds, Warren Beattys biopic of the radical journalist \nand, for a time, Lenin sympathizer John Reed, we first see Reed \nchasing a runaway horse-drawn vehicle during his time with the \nrevolutionary Pancho Villa. At the end of the film this image emerges \nonce again, where Reed, disillusioned by the Bolshevik Revolution, \nonce again is chasing another horse-drawn vehicle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis symbolism aptly fits Roger Williams (16031683), a Puritan \nminister, the foremost proponent of the concept of the separation of \nchurch and state, and dogged promoter of free thought. Williams was \nforever chasing his horse-drawn carts and after catching them, he \nfound them insufficiently radical for the brand of libertarianism he \nfavored.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1930s expensively educated students at college, as typical of \nthat age group, often became Communists in a burst of youthful \nenthusiasm.And less explosively, many, now middle-aged, wandered back \nto conservatism (with the key component of anti-Communism).But, as \nGeorge Orwell perceptively noted, the Communism of that time, which \ndemanded slavish worship of Joseph Stalin, was as dogmatic in its way \nas the Catholic Church was.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the seventeenth century Williams made his switch, ironically, at \nCambridge. His turn was religious. Raised in the exclusive Anglican \nChurch of England, Williams became a Puritan. But he never accepted \nany of its literal-mindedness and dogmas or that of any other \ndenomination. It was because of this that he was repelled by fellow \ncollege student Oliver Cromwell, in which the future religious \ndictator was already in thrall to a warlike God Is on Our Side \nManicheaism. Williams never succumbed to such views even when he was \nbeing persecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis collegiate switch to Puritanism was a radical, even \nlife-threatening, act. For whatever the image and behavior of New \nWorld Puritansthat of fanatics who installed a theocracy in \nseventeenth-century Massachusettsin seventeenth-century England it \ntook intellectual as well as physical courage to declare for \nreligious purification. Castigating the official church of Britain, \nthe Anglican Church, as hopelessly corrupt and challenging the \nreligious basis of the monarchy, the divine right of kings, could \nearn these dissenters imprisonment, torture, and, in some instances, \nburning at the stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne cannot overestimate the influence of key figures of that on \nWilliams. The son a merchant tailor, with an astonishing gift for \nlanguages (in America he learned the Indian language, and even wrote \nthe first dictionary of their lexicon), the teenager was apprenticed \nin his formative years to Sir Edward Coke, Englands premier jurist. \nAlthough Coke had some conventional religious beliefs, he \nnevertheless veered dangerously close to detaching the Anglican \nChurch from its partner, the monarchy. As chief justice of common law \ncourts, Coke sought to rescue religious dissidents from \necclesiastical judges with a penchant for torture and execution.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom this springboard Williams asserted that all religions should be \nafforded equal treatment in court (i.e., Muslims and Jews). Williams \nwould also go further than Coke in the latters measures toward the \nseparation of church and state.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams was part of the second wave of Puritans who left England \nto create a purified religious community in the New World. He \nsettled in Salem in 1631: it was the epicenter of masochist \ntheocracies. Williams for a while preached in the Salem church, but \nhis views that governmental tampering in religion was a violation of \nsoul liberty soon brought him into court. Williams was forced to \nstep down as a Puritan pastor for his advocating the wall of \nseparation between church and state. The verdict was that, as a \npastor, and later as a preacher in his home to his like-minded \ncitizens, he had expressed new and dangerous opinions, in particular \nhis denial of the magistrates authority in religious matters, and \nhis seditious letters, one in thename of the Salem church attacking \nthe General Court, and the second to the Salem church urging their \nseparation from the other churches of the colony.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what were these new and dangerous opinions?\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams asserted, couched in religious terms that the government \nshould not be involved in religious manners. Citing the religious \nwars of the Old World, which he said resulted in oceans of blood, \nhe stated that when a government favored one denomination over \nanother, this was forced worship, which stinks in Gods nostrils. \nHe also wrote that God is too large to be housed under one roof and \nthat there isno regularly constituted church of Christ on, nor any \nperson qualified to administer church ordinances. For a government \nto oversee the individuals relationship to God was for Williams a \nrape of the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Williams insisted that his views were not new. The separation of \nchurch and state was formulated by early Christians: Gods people, \nsince the coming of the King of Israel, the Lord Jesus, have openly \nand constantly professed, that no civil magistrate, no king nor \nCaesar, [has] any power over the souls or consciences of their \nsubjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nEqually threatening to the Boston authorities was Williams view \ntoward neighboring Indian tribes.Almost alone about Indian relations \nin the seventeenth century, he didnt regard them as savages but \nthe equal of Whites:\u0014\n\u0014\nBoast not, proud English, of thy birth and blood,\u0014\n\u0014\nThy brother Indian is by birth as Good.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf one blood God had made Him, and Thee and All,\u0014\n\u0014\nAs wise, as fair, as strong, as personal.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs such, he refuted the idea that all discovered lands where Indians \nlived belonged to the monarchy (known as the royal charter).\u0014\n\u0014\nConvicted of sedition and heresy and ordered banished from Salem \nby the Boston court, Williams soon had the opportunity to put his \nbeliefs in practice.In 1636 he, along with some followers, left Salem \nand founded Rhode Island (after purchasing the land from the \nIndians).Believing that God had guided him and his followers to this \narea, he christened the settlement Providence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams established the first area to practice the separation of \nchurch and state in the New World. To merge the two, he held, harmed \nnot only democracy but religion as well. Theocracies were themselves \nheretical in their determination to oversee the individuals \nrelationship to God. To rob the individual of this personal \nrelationship went against Scripture; Williams believed the only \ntrue religions were based on a voluntary and free conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitically Williams innovated majority rule. The religious \nminorities who came to Rhode Island could become full citizens by \nmajority vote.He codified the idea that the government could rule \nonly in civil matters. As such, the Providence government could not \npunish those who violated the religious principles contained in the \nTen Commandments, such as idolatry, Sabbathbreaking, false worship, \nand blasphemy. Of these violations Williams wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nBut who is to decide who truly fears the Lord? The magistrate has no \npower to enforce religious demands. The laws of the First Table of \nthe Ten Commandments are not regulations for civil society or a \npolitical order.They belong to the realm of religion, not politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nA century before Thomas Jefferson (who cited Williams as the \noriginal thought influencer on the First Amendment), Williams \nasserted that civil authorities could rule only from the moral \nprinciples of the Bible. Thus, citizens could be prosecuted for \nrobbery, adultery, or murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Williams was more radical than Jefferson. In opposition to the \nslave-owing Jefferson, Williams was anti-slavery. When Massachusetts \nintroduced laws legalizing slavery in the New World, Williams in 1643 \nhelped pass a law designed to halt the introduction of slavery into \nRhode Island (this did not prevent Newport from joining the African \nslave trade in 1700, decades after Williams death; Newport would \nbecome, according to historians, the leading port for American ships \ncarrying slaves until 1776).\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams did help found a denomination: in this case, the Baptists. \nIn their doctrinal statement Baptists supported the separation of \nchurch and state and an immersion baptism for believers only, rather \nthan infant baptism. Although Williams supported such ideas, he was \ncareful not to affiliate himself too closely with the Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those who historically attack dead White males as racist \nBible-thumping hypocrites, Williams was by any standards a \nlibertarian: indeed, one could call him a religious one. Still, he \nheld the then-subversive view\u0014\n\u0014\n(and in some circles equally subversive today) that Christianity was \nnot essential for a moral and secure government. He hated \ntheocracies and the wars that resulted from favoring one religion \nover another. He saw Indians as the equal of Anglo-Saxons. A decided \nChristian, he was inclusive toward all religions: It hath fallen out \nsometimes, that both Papists and Protestants, Jews and Turks, may be \nembarked upon one ship; upon which supposal I affirm, that all the \nliberty of conscience, that I ever pleaded for, turns upon these two \nhingesthat none of the Papists, Protestants, Jews, or Turks be \nforced to come to the ships prayers or worship, nor be compelled \nfrom their own particular prayers or worship. I acknowledge that to \nmolest any person, Jew or Gentile, for either professing doctrine or \npracticing worship merely religious or spiritual is to persecute him, \nand such a person (whatever his doctrine or practice be, true or \nfalse) suffers persecution for conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this Williams was much more tolerant than John Winthrop, who \nsought a closed community of European Christians. For Williams all \nreligions had an equal place in society. But he also parted company \nfrom the aristocratic Winthrop in other matters. Winthrop believed \nthat God determined who was rich and who was poor, and for the poor \nto rebel against the rich was a violation of Gods will: the poore, \nand dispised should not rise vpp against their superiors, and shake \noff their yoake.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough mostly concerned with matters of separation from church and \nstate and the perils to individual liberty, Williams did not share \nWinthrops view that God wanted the dispised to stay in their \nplace. The class structure of society was not ordained by God, but \nwas a matter of economics that was alterable.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter an examination of his life in detail, it is apparent why \nWilliams deserves the title of the father of the separation of church \nand state. He practiced what he preached, favoring neither religion \nover government nor vice versa.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams himself abandoned Puritanism and the Baptist church he had \nhelped found (the first in America), opposing all sects and creeds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle Author: Ron Capshaw\u0014\n\u0014\nRon Capshaw is a journalist and freelance writer in Midlothian, \nVirginia.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nSome recent discussion has suggested that the founding fathers \nthought they were guaranteeing only a freedom for religion, not a \nfreedom from religion. This is surely true of neither Madison nor \nJefferson, nor of Baptists who followed in their train. John Leland, \nan eighteenth-century Baptist itinerant in Virginia, argued that \nwhether a man believed in one god, twenty gods, or no god was not the \nconcern of the state. Religion is not in any direct way the concern \nof the state, he further declared. The law should not favor \nministers, nor should it penalize them. The law should be silent \nabout them: protect them as citizens, not as sacred officers, for the \ncivil law knows no sacred officers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the inevitable interaction between the civil and the \necclesiastical estates, what is a legitimate entanglement and what is \nan excessive or totally inappropriate entanglement? What are the \nboundaries that must not be overstepped, whether on theological or \nmoral or Constitutional grounds? Supreme Court justices over the \nyears, and especially in the last four decades, have not found easy \nanswers to those questions. Nor have the leaders of virtually all \ndenominations in America found the lines clear and the answers easy. \nThe application of principle is more difficult than the assertion of \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn theological grounds, the state has no right to be the armed \navenger against false religion nor the armed defender of true \nreligion. On Constitutional grounds, the state has no right to be \neither religions foe or religions patron. On theological and moral \ngrounds, the churches have no right to coerce the consciences of \nothers: on theological and moral and constitutional grounds, the \nchurches have every right to organize, propagandize, persuade, \ninfluence, lobby and cajole.

Leaders from the top and leaders of all stripes: Parents, \nbosses, reporters, columnists, professors, union chiefs, everyone. \nThe consequence of the crescendo of anger leads to a very bad place. \nNo sane person can want that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRomney's comments come days after federal authorities announced they \nhad foiled a multiperson plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen \nWhitmer, something Romney had made mention of in his statement. \nWhitmer has tied the thwarted plot to Trump's rhetoric.\u0014\n\u0014\nRomney has occasionally spoken out against the president and was the \nonly Republican senator to cast a vote in favor of convicting Trump \nin his impeachment trial earlier this year.\u0014",

    "words": "Researcher Says the Episcopal Church Will Cease to Exist by 2050 Due \nto Declining Attendance, Membership\u0014\nMilton Quintanilla | ChristianHeadlines.com | November 30, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nThe future of the Episcopal Church seems bleak as plummeting \nmembership numbers may ultimately lead the denomination to close its \ndoors for good in the next few decades, The Christian Post reports.\u0014\n\u0014\n Rev. Dwight Zscheile, an Episcopal priest and professor, told Church \nLeaders that the future is dire for the denomination and he \npredicts the denomination will cease to exist by around 2050.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe overall picture is dire. Not one of decline as much as demise \nwithin the next generation unless trends change significantly,\" \nZscheile said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this rate, there will be no one in worship by around 2050 in the \nentire denomination. he continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nZschelie also explained that while offering pledges have increased, \nthe fact that fewer people are giving more money is not a \nsustainable trend over the long term.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a demographic analysis by researcher Ryan Burge, \napproximately 55 percent of U.S. Episcopalians are age 60 and older, \nwhich is the highest average age of the largest 20 religious \ntraditions nationwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurge told The Holy Post podcast in a recent episode, that the \nEpiscopal church will be dead in two decades. He noted in a \nsubsequent blog post Episcopalians Are in Trouble that while the \ndenomination might not die out completely, it will likely be \"vastly \ndiminished\" and on \"life support.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA terrifying reality emerges when looking at the mode as opposed to \nthe average age, Burge wrote. The modal age of an Episcopalian in \n2019 was 69.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 2040, Burge estimates the Episcopal Church could see membership \nnumbers as low as 0.7 percent of the U.S population, half of its \ncurrent size. Currently, 14 percent of professing Episcopalians are \nparents of children under the age of 18.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to The Christian Post, as the Episcopalian denomination \nbegan to lean in a more progressive direction  including the 2003 \nappointment of openly gay bishop, Gene Robison  many conservative \ncongregations have left.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church had also been hollowed out by increasing secularization in \nareas where liberal religious traditions are prominent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1960, the denomination was reportedly at its peak with \napproximately 3.6 million Americans identified as Episcopalian. \nAccording to a 2018 report by The Episcopal Churchs Office of the \nGeneral Convention, membership numbers have dropped to 1.676 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2009, regular worship attendance was approximately 724,000. By \n2019, however, attendance decreased to 579,000 on an average Sunday, \na nearly 25 percent drop over a decade.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Canon Neil Elliot offered a similar sentiment for the Anglican \nChurch of Canada during a November 2019 presentation before the \nCouncil of General Synod. According to Elliot, the Anglican Church in \nCanada may cease to exist by 2040 due to a sharp decline in \nmembership.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer.\u0014",

    "words": "Fasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials\u0014\n \u0014\nOn this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay \nColony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the \ntragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons \nfor the day of fasting given by the resolution were, \"so all of God's \npeople may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity \nmay be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this \nland; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we \nhave done amiss, to do so no more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of \njustice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's \nPuritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen \nwere hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused \nwere women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's \ntownspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the \nproceedings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were \nbewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had \nseen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, \nscapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no \nevidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was \npresented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two \nwitnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. \nIt was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the \naccused.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers \nrather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out \nstrongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the \nBiblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige \nof Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the \nwhole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts \nlegislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held \non January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could \noffer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them \nfrom repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the \nland. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the \ntrials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and \nguidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided \nover many of the capital judgments, published a written confession \nacknowledging his own \"blame and shame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSalem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the \ntrials. In 1710, the Massachusetts legislature reversed some of the \nconvictions, and in the following years authorities gave compensation \nto the families of the accused witches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nKennedy, James with Newcombe, Jerry.

    "title": "RUTHERFORD EXILED FOR PUBLISHING",
    "words": "\u0014\nRutherford Exiled for Publishing\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNot many pastors rise at 3 A.M. to be sure they have sufficient time \nfor God and their people. Samuel Rutherford was one who did. Thus it \ncame as a great blow to him when he was compelled to leave the folk \nhe loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRutherford had published an Apology of Divine Grace against the \nheresy of righteousness based on human works. This work offended the \ngovernment. On this day, February 20, 1636, Archbishop Laud, who \ncontrolled the established churches of Britain, exiled Rutherford to \nAberdeen. He forbade him to preach anywhere in Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem Rutherford could not be blamed if he slipped into \ndepression. The years had not been kind to him. In 1630, after barely \nfive years of marriage, his wife died following a painful illness of \nthirteen months. Their two children also died, and Samuel himself \nsuffered a debilitating fever for three months. Now he was in exile, \nexcluded from the work he cherished most.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut rather than become depressed, he wrote encouraging letters to his \nfriends and his church home. These are full of wise and pithy \nsayings: \"Duties are ours, and events are the Lord's.\" Or, \"It is not \nfor us to set an hourglass to the Creator of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hundreds of letters he wrote in exile became a classic. Full of \nencouragement and loving devotion to Christ, they showed that \nRutherford had an intimate communion with the Lord and was not afraid \nto talk about it. He always wrote about Christ and the wondrous glory \nof His Person. Charles Haddon Spurgeon later said, \"When we are dead \nand gone, let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters \nto be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the \nwritings of mere man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638 Rutherford was restored to his church. His many sufferings \ngave him even greater sympathy for the suffering in his flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1640s, Rutherford represented the church of Scotland in \nthe Westminster Assembly in London. He helped author the Shorter \nCatechism, with its famous beginning, \"What is the chief end of man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGlimpses #95.

    "title": "RELICS EXPLAINED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH",
    "words": "RELICS EXPLAINED BY THE \nCATHOLIC CHURCH\u0014\n\u0014\nMany non-Catholics particularly shy away from the sacramental aspects \nof Catholicismand not from the seven sacraments only. What they \ndislike is the mixing of spirit and matter, the gift of something \nspiritualgraceby means of physical things. That, after all, is what \nthe sacraments are. This tendency to drive a wedge between spirit and \nmatter stems from age-old heresies known as Dualism, Marcionism, and \nManichaeism. Marcion in particular taught that the God of the Old \nTestament was evil in creating matter, but the God of the New \nTestament is a different and good God, who raises us to the level of \nspirit. The less one is entrapped by matter, the closer one is to \nGod. Needless to say, this does not fit well with the sacramentsor \nwith the incarnation!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sacraments, common material things, such as water, wine, \nbread, oil, and the imposition of hands, result in the giving of \ngrace. Related to the sacraments are the sacramentals, objects such \nas medals, blessed palms, holy water, and ashes. Their use can lead \npeople to receive or respond to grace. Many non-Catholics wrongly \nbelieve that the Church teaches that these sacramentals actually \nprovide grace. But one of the biggest problems for non-Catholics are \nthe relics of saintsthe bones, ashes, clothing, or personal \npossessions of the apostles and other holy people which are held in \nreverence by the Church and sometimes associated with miraculous \nhealings and other acts of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is how Bart Brewer, ex-priest and head of Mission to Catholics \nInternational, phrases the complaint in his autobiography, Pilgrimage \nFrom Rome:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother dogma that has bothered Catholics for centuries is the \nveneration of relics and the claims that they have magical powers. \nEven Martin Luther wondered how there could be twenty-six apostles \nburied in Germany, when there were only twelve in the entire Bible! \nIt is said that if all the pieces of the cross displayed in Catholic \nchurches were assembled together, it would take a ten-ton truck to \ncarry them. It is clear that most relics are frauds. Furthermore, \nthere is nothing in the Bible that supports the veneration of relics, \neven if they are genuine (page 132).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a unique paragraph in that each sentence in it contains one \nor two blunders. Lets go through them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is the claim that the veneration of relics has bothered \nCatholics for centuries. Considering the high regard Catholics have \nhad for relics throughout the years, this is absurd. It hasnt been \nCatholics who have been botheredit has been non-Catholics (and \nex-Catholics).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhats more, the Church does not claim that relics have magical \npowers. Note that Brewer cites no Catholic work which makes such a \nclaimbecause there isnt any. The sacramental system is the opposite \nof magic. In magic, something material is regarded as the cause of \nsomething spiritual; in other words, a lower cause is expected to \nproduce a higher effect.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Magic in Sacraments\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sacraments (and, derivatively, sacramentals and relics) dont \ncompel God to work in a certain way. Their use depends on God, who \nestablished their efficacy, so their effects are divine, not natural, \nin their origin. It is God who sanctions the use of relics; it is not \na matter of men overpowering God through their own powers or the \npowers of nature, which is what magic amounts to.\u0014\nWhen Jesus healed the blind man in John 9:1-7, did the Lord use magic \nmud and spittle? Was it actually a magic potion he mixed in the clay, \nor was it simply that Jesus saw fit to use matter in association with \nthe conferral of his grace? The Lord is no dualist. He made matter, \nhe loves matter, and he had no qualms about becoming matter himself \nto accomplish our redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the next sentence Brewer casts ridicule on relics by referring to \nLuthers comment, but the rejoinder should have been obvious to him. \nApart from the fact that there are more than twelve apostles \nmentioned in the Bible (there are at least sixteen, counting Paul, \nBarnabas, James the Just, and Matthias), there is no reason to think \nthat the whole of a saints skeleton must be kept in one reliquary. \nIn fact, from what we know about the way early Christians preserved \nthe bones of those killed during the persecutions, that would be \nunusual. More commonly, the saints bones were divided up, so various \ncommunities could have a portion of his relics: the skull here, a \nhand there, other bones elsewhere. So it would be proper for several \ncities to claim to have the relics of a single saint.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen-Ton Truck or Warship?\u0014\n\u0014\nNow for the classic argument. As Brewer phrases it, if all the \nalleged pieces of the True Cross were gathered together, it would \ntake a ten-ton truck to carry them. Thats a modern way to put the \ncharge. It used to be said the pieces would be enough to build a \nwarship, but warships arent made out of wood any longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither way, the charge is nonsense. In 1870 a Frenchman, Rohault de \nFleury, catalogued all the relics of the True Cross, including relics \nthat were said to have existed but were lost. He measured the \nexisting relics and estimated the volume of the missing ones. Then he \nadded up the figures and discovered that the fragments, if glued \ntogether, would not have made up more than one-third of a cross. The \nscandal wasnt that there was too much wood. The scandal was that \nmost of the True Cross, after being unearthed in Jerusalem in the \nfourth century, was lost again!\u0014\n\u0014\nBrewers next charge is this: It is clear that most relics are \nfrauds. It isnt clear at all. Certainly nothing he said indicates \nthat. Have there been any frauds? Sure. But in most cases, relics are \neither known to be genuine or there is some reason to think they may \nbe genuine, even if complete proof is impossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the famous Shroud of Turin, which scientists have been examining \nfor some years. The scientists admit their experiments cannot \nestablish that the Shroud is the actual burial cloth of Christthey \nadmit that is impossiblebut they also say they might be able to \neliminate the possibility of forgery. That is, they apparently are \ndemonstrating that the Shroud was a burial cloth that was wrapped \naround someone who was crucified in the same manner as Christ, \nperhaps at about the same time he was crucified (there is \nconsiderable dispute about the age of the Shroud, and the carbon-14 \ntests that have been performed on the Shroud have been defective), \nand in the same area he was crucified.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost relics cannot be fakes because most relics are the bones of \nordinary saints of history who were well known and whose remains were \nnever lost in the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church has never pronounced that any particular reliceven that \nof the crossis genuine. But, the Church does approve of honor being \ngiven to the relics that can with reasonable probability be \nconsidered authentic.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs There Room for Doubt?\u0014\n\u0014\nWill there always be room for doubt for those who seek it? Sure. And \nif that is the case with the Shroud of Turin, it is more the case \nwith most other relics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe skeptic will always be able to say, This might not have been \nso-and-sos, or You might be mistaken, and wed have to admit \nthats true. There might have been a mistake, or fakes might have \nbeen substituted for the real relics.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe evaluate relics the same way we evaluate the bona fides of \nanything else. Did George Washington really sleep in a particular \nbed? We have to do some detective work to find out. We may never know \nfor sure. We may have to rely on probabilities. On the other hand, we \nmight have incontrovertible proof, that could be disbelieved only by \nthe skeptic who insists George Washington never existed at all.\u0014\nIts the same with relics. Some are beyond doubt. Others are so \nhighly probable that it would be rash to doubt. Others are merely \nprobable. And some, yes, are improbable (though we wouldnt want to \ntoss out even most of those, in case we err and toss out something \nthat really is a relic).\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Veneration?\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Brewer claims that there is nothing in the Bible that \nsupports the veneration of relics, even if they are genuine. Again, \nnot so.\u0014\nOne of the most moving accounts of the veneration of relics is that \nof the very body of Christ itself. Rather than leaving his body on \nthe cross, to be taken down and disposed of by the Romans (as was the \ncustomary practice), Joseph of Arimathea courageously interceded with \nPilate for Christs body (Mark 15:43, John 19:38). He donated his \nown, newly hewn tomb as Christs resting place (Matt. 27:60). \nNicodemus came and donated over a hundred pounds of spices to wrap \ninside Jesus grave clothes (John 19:39), that amount of spices being \nused only for the most honored dead. And after he was buried, the \nwomen went to reverently visit the tomb (Matt. 28:1) and to further \nanoint Christs body with spices even though it had already been \nsealed inside the tomb (Mark 16:1, Luke 24:1). These acts of \nreverence were more than just the usual courtesy shown to the remains \nof the dead; they were special respect shown to the body of a most \nholy manin this case, the holiest man who has ever lived, for he was \nGod Incarnate.\u0014\n\u0014\nRelics in Early Christianity\u0014\n\u0014\nThe veneration of relics is seen explicitly as early as the account \nof Polycarps martyrdom written by the Smyrnaeans in A.D. 156. In it, \nthe Christians describe the events following his burning at the \nstake: We took up his bones, which are more valuable than precious \nstones and finer than refined gold, and laid them in a suitable \nplace, where the Lord will permit us to gather ourselves together, as \nwe are able, in gladness and joy and to celebrate the birthday of his \nmartyrdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn speaking of the veneration of relics in the early Church, the \nanti-Catholic historian Adolph Harnack writes, . . . [N]o Church \ndoctor of repute restricted it. All of them rather, even the \nCappadocians, countenanced it. The numerous miracles which were \nwrought by bones and relics seemed to confirm their worship. The \nChurch therefore would not give up the practice, although a violent \nattack was made upon it by a few cultured heathens and besides by the \nManichaeans (Harnack, History of Dogma, tr., IV, 313).\u0014\nIn the fourth century the great biblical scholar, Jerome, declared, \nWe do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down \nto the creature rather than to the creator, but we venerate the \nrelics of the martyrs in order the better to adore him whose martyrs \nthey are (Ad Riparium, i, P.L., XXII, 907). `\u0014\n\u0014\nRelics in Scripture\u0014\n\u0014\nKeep in mind what the Church says about relics. It doesnt say there \nis some magical power in them. There is nothing in the relic itself, \nwhether a bone of the apostle Peter or water from Lourdes, that has \nany curative ability. The Church just says that relics may be the \noccasion of Gods miracles, and in this the Church follows Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe use of the bones of Elisha brought a dead man to life: So Elisha \ndied, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the \nland in the spring of the year. And as a man was being buried, lo, a \nmarauding band was seen and the man was cast into the grave of \nElisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he \nrevived, and stood on his feet (2 Kgs. 13:20-21). This is an \nunequivocal biblical example of a miracle being performed by God \nthrough contact with the relics of a saint!\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilar are the cases of the woman cured of a hemorrhage by touching \nthe hem of Christs cloak (Matt. 9:20-22) and the sick who were \nhealed when Peters shadow passed over them (Acts 5:14-16). And God \ndid extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, so that \nhandkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, \nand diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them (Acts \n19:11-12).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf these arent examples of the use of relics, what are? In the case \nof Elisha, a Lazarus-like return from the dead was brought about \nthrough the prophets bones. In the New Testament cases, physical \nthings (the cloak, the shadow, handkerchiefs and aprons) were used to \neffect cures. There is a perfect congruity between present-day \nCatholic practice and ancient practice. If you reject all Catholic \nrelics today as frauds, you should also reject these biblical \naccounts as frauds.\u0014\n\u0014\n________________________________________\u0014\nNIHIL OBSTAT: I have concluded that the materials\u0014\npresented in this work are free of doctrinal or moral errors.\u0014\nBernadeane Carr, STL, Censor Librorum, August 10, 2004\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBERING JOHN CLAYPOOL",
    "words": "Remembering John Claypool on the 10th anniversary of his death\u0014\nCHANDLER VINSON  |  SEPTEMBER 3, 2015\u0014\n\u0014\nI have been told that long before I stepped foot on the campus of \nMercer Universitys McAfee School of Theology the issue of what \nstudents ought to call professors was addressed at a staff meeting. \nAt a relatively small school which stresses community, defining the \nfine line between professor and friend can be difficult though it is \nessential to do so for the roles to be played properly. After much \ndebate, I believe it was decided that each professor could decide for \nherself what students ought call her.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was here, in my second year as a student at McAfee that I met John \nClaypool. It was Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2003. I remember this date because \nI met him at my all-time low. My perfectionism had put me in the \nthroes of depression, the girl I planned to marry had ended our \nrelationship and while praying I inexplicably felt led to call a man \nI had never really met.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first, I left a message on his answering machine. I seldom cry but \nin that message I briefly recounted my predicament through \nintermittent sobs. I had reached the point of suffering where I was \njust too hurt to be embarrassed. Shortly after hanging up, my phone \nrang. It was Claypool, taking pity on a blubbering stranger with an \ninvitation for lunch the next day. He assured me he would do whatever \nhe could to help me.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy aforementioned perfectionism was out of hand and, not wanting to \nappear ignorant, I familiarized myself by reading four of his books \nbefore our encounter. I did not know it at the time, but I would be \nmeeting the person who would influence me more than any other outside \nof my parents. It is uncanny that a decade after his passing, it is \nhis words I find on my lips more often than anyone I have ever met.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Dr. Claypool greeted me, I found an unassuming man who had long \nago ceased to be impressed by his own greatness. We shared the same \nheight and ruddy complexion though Claypool always dressed in suits \nand emitted a distinct scent of Ralph Lauren Polo cologne.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had been a renowned Southern Baptist preacher whose sermons had \ncirculated in newsletter form long before the Internet made such \naccessibility commonplace. Later, he had become an Episcopal priest \nand was now in this final stage of his life returning to his roots as \na professor in the Baptist tradition at McAfee. He had settled into \nhis role as the campus spiritual guru and legend-in-residence.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next two years I took his classes, occasionally served as \nhis driver and availed myself of any opportunity to speak with him. I \nread his books and internalized his catch phrases (Despair is \nPresumptuous, Life is Gift, Love is Not Coercive, etc.). I also \ngot to know him and found that I loved the author far more than his \nwritings.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople have often asked me why the acclaimed preacher took such an \ninterest in me. I would like to think that he saw some of himself in \nme, especially that double-edged sword of perfectionism that we both \npossessed. But honestly, I think he would have struggled not to like \nsomeone who thought he was the greatest preacher since Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur connection may also have been in part because when we met we were \nboth so open about our brokenness. He had been battling multiple \nmyeloma, the cancer which would ultimately claim his life on Sept. 3, \n2005. Though I felt my trials were minimal compared to his, he \nreminded me you are no stranger to disappointment.\u0014\n\u0014\nI learned so much from Dr. Claypool. He taught me that everyone has \nsomething to teach me, to aspire to do something rather than to be \nsomebody and that God loves me because I am a human being, not a \nhuman doing. Though I do not always preach confessionally, like \nClaypool, I am willing to undress myself spiritually in front of a \ncongregation when the situation calls for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Claypool could also teach me without saying a word, often by \npoint of comparison. An esteemed minister once advised one of my \nseminary classes, Dont be a prophet if you can help it. He was \nalluding to the fact that prophets were typically murdered for their \ntrouble (Matt. 23:33, 37; Luke 11:47, 49, 13:34). In another lecture, \nI saw the same pastor weep during a discussion of the civil rights \nmovement. He admitted that he had known that segregation was wrong \nbut could not risk his career to address the social issues of his \nday. He had not been a prophet and his tears represented regret.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn all of our talks, I cannot remember Dr. Claypool ever directly \nmentioning being intentionally prophetic. But when he died, the \nLouisville Courier-Journal ran a photograph from April 1961 of a \nyoung Claypool and Martin Luther King, Jr. sitting together at a \nLouisville diner. His support of King cost him dearly and ignited \ngreat conflict. But he had no regrets. That picture of Claypool and \nKing sits on my office desk to constantly remind me that I would \nrather shed my tears earlier than later.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Claypool taught me how to suffer. I called him shortly after his \nfirst chemotherapy treatment in hopes of livening his spirits. I \nfoolishly asked how he was doing. What did I expect him to say? I \ndont know what I anticipated but it was certainly not what I heard \non the other end of the receiver. He equated chemotherapy to taking \nthe Eucharist: something from outside his body which he did not \ndeserve was entering in hopes of redeeming it!\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Claypool also taught me how to die. I dont pretend to have fully \nembraced my own mortality, but I know I am better prepared having \nwatched him die so well. When his cancer returned after a brief \nremission, he sent only a brief message back to our concerned school: \nThe bottom has held up. He meant that his faith had held firm even \nunder the rigors of cancer. He credited his success to his God, \nreworking 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight, I have \nfinished the course, but I have found that the faith has kept me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he constantly taught me, Dr. Claypool went out of his way to \nmake me feel as though I was his colleague. I distinctly remember a \ntime when he and his lovely wife, Ann, invited me into their home. \nSomehow the discussion veered toward a comparison of Buddha and \nJesus. Seeking my input, the aged professor appeared enthralled as I \nspoke. As if I were the expert in the room.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Claypool went to great lengths to demonstrate that we were \nequals. But I knew better. It was the one time I could not believe \nhis message. It just never seemed right to call him John.\u0014\n\u0014\n------------------------------------------------\u0014\nThe Reverend Dr. John Rowan Claypool, IV, ThD\u0014\n(A biography by Samford Media Services)\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn ClaypoolHighly regarded for his outstanding preaching and \nwriting, the world renowned Rev. John Claypool served churches across \nthe Southeast - including Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, \nMississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Before retiring from full-time \nparish ministry he served, for fourteen years, as the fifth rector of \nSaint Luke's Episcopal Church in Birmingham, AL. He then served as \nPriest Associate at All Saints Episcopal Church in Atlanta, Georgia \nand Professor of Homiletics at the McAfee School of Theology of \nMercer University in Atlanta.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was born in Franklin, Kentucky, and grew up in Nashville, \nTennessee. Johns lifelong passion for people, for truth, and for \nlife was apparent even in his early childhood. His sister, Marie, and \nfriends recall that John was a caring and loving child. In \nadolescence, he became competitive in schoolwork, athletics, and his \nfavorite hobby, racquetball. He completed his undergraduate degree in \nphilosophy at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and his theological \ntraining at Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville and later the \nEpiscopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest in Austin, Texas. In \naddition to earning his doctorate in theology, John received six \nhonorary doctoral degrees. He served as pastor of five Baptist \nchurches in Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Mississippi before being \nordained an Episcopal priest in 1986.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was nationally and internationally recognized not only as one of \nour nations most gifted preachers but also as a compassionate \nteacher, pastoral caregiver, and an honest and inspirational author. \nHis personal struggle to understand the death of his 10-year-old \ndaughter, Laura Lue, from leukemia led John to the unshakable \nconviction that life is gift, a spiritual insight he used to \nencourage countless other of us fellow strugglers over the years. \nThe heartfelt thoughts he shared with his congregation in his sermons \nafter that life-changing event formed the basis for the first of \nJohns 11 books, Tracks of a Fellow Struggler, that Wayne Oates \ndescribes as a disciplined confession . . . questions, complaints, \nagonies, ecstasies, and all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough his spoken and written words, John constantly reminded us \nthat Gods goodness is stronger than our badness and that we did \nnot earn our way into this life nor our way into the next one. He \nbelieved that grace, freely given, was ours to simply accept from the \ngenerous Holy One. These ideals, his compassion, and his caring belie \nthe steely determination that John displayed early in his career. \nWhile serving at Crescent Hill Baptist Church in Louisville Kentucky \n(1960-71), John played a pivotal leadership role in the struggle for \ncivil rights. He was the treasurer for the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference in Kentucky, participated as a regular panelist \non the WHAS AM radio program The Moral Side of the News, and was a \nfriend and colleague of The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Crescent \nHill Baptist was the first church in Louisville to integrate.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn lived an adage attributed to Edmund Burke: The only thing \nnecessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. \nJohn certainly could not be accused of doing nothing. His strong \nmorality and willingness to take on controversial issues included not \nonly civil rights but also a public stance against the Vietnam War, \nmost notably while speaking to the Southern Baptist Convention. After \nbecoming a priest in the Episcopal Church, John once again acted out \nof his deeply held personal convictions of the equality of all \npersons and called The Rev. Joy Phipps, the first female priest to \nserve in Birmingham, to his staff at St. Lukes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had the ability to take complex ideas, distill them, and then \npresent them in such a way that everyone could grasp. John taught us \nhow Jesus lived, how He treated every life He touched in loving ways, \nand how we could and should do the same and he did this not only \nthrough sermons and study series but also through his actions. John \nshowed us how to live life to its fullest, and he showed us how to \ncome to the end life with dignity and grace. After he was diagnosed \nwith advanced multiple myeloma in 2002, John and his beloved wife Ann \nexplored all the treatment options, and he fought the disease with \nunswerving determination. It is paradoxical that someone who spent \nthe majority of his life preparing himself and others for eternal \nlife would fight so hard to remain in this realm. When asked about \nthis, John always replied that he really wanted to live because he \ndid not feel ready to be separated from his closest loved ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nLife was a journey to John. He was always changing, growing, open to \nnew possibilities, recalls The Very Rev. Harry Pritchett, former \nDean of the Cathedral of Saint John in New York City. It was my \ngreat privilege to be his friend during this part of the trip.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn & Ann ClaypoolKirby Godsey, president of Mercer University, \nadds, John Claypool touched our souls. Amidst our wounds and our \ntriumphs, his voice became for us the voice of God. He embraced the \nMcAfee School of Theology, his students, and his colleagues with a \nspecial measure of grace and with unfettered gentleness. Johns \npresence in our lives and our histories is more than mere death can \never take away. He will continue to walk among us, giving light to \nour steps, wisdom for our hearts, and hope to our souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn is survived by his much beloved wife Ann Wilkinson Scheyd \nClaypool; son, John Rowan Claypool V; grandson John R Claypool VI; \nstepdaughter Laura Crawford Williams and her husband, Marty; stepson \nCharles Tarleton Williams, III, daughter, Ashley; his sister Marie \nClaypool Piper and her husband, Bob. John was preceded in death by \nhis parents and his ten year-old daughter Laura Lue in 1970.\u0014",

    "title": "REBELS WITH A CAUSE",
    "words": "Rebels with a cause\u0014\nMark Noll\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible of the Early American Republic\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Continental Congress in 1776 asked Thomas Jefferson \n(17431826) and Benjamin Franklin (17061790) to design a seal for \nits would-be independent nation, they proposed images from Exodus 13 \nand 14Israels miraculous journey through the Red Sea and the \npillars of cloud and fire with which God protected his people. In so \ndoing they touched on Revolutionary questions: Did the blessing of \nGod rest on people in rebellion against their anointed monarch? Were \nthey slaves toiling under the thumb of Pharaoh, awaiting Gods \nfreedom? Triumphant Israelites finally entering the promised land? \nThese images and more competed for attention as Bible believers \neagerly turned to Scripture for a word from God for the times. \u0014\n\u0014\nMischievous taxes\u0014\nThe result could be eccentricas in a sermon by Rhode Island Baptist \nJohn Allen (c. 17411785) on Micah 7:3. Allen somehow turned a great \nman uttereth his mischievous desire into a cry that Parliaments tax \non tea meant absolute tyranny. Copies of the sermon sold like \nhotcakes. Contemporary preachers also drew theological conclusions \nwhile commenting on contested issues, which did not always agree; \nJohn Witherspoon (17231794), president of the College of New Jersey, \npreached on Psalm 76:10 less than two months before becoming the only \nclergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon \nstrongly defended the struggle against Britain, but also stressed \nGods providential ability to bring good out of human evil. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Fletcher (17291785), one of John Wesleys close colleagues, \nexplained that Romans 13 gives magistrates power to execute wrath \nupon him that doeth evil. To Fletcher, colonists who complained \nabout the slavery of Parliament while enslaving Africans were prime \nexamples of evildoers. He concluded that Britain should fight against \nwhat he called the tyranny of republican despotism. But David \nGriffith, a Virginia Anglican who spoke from the same text, came to \nthe opposite conclusion before fellow clergy in 1775. He drew on Old \nTestament examples to explain what Paul meant in Romans 13 by the \npowers that be are ordained by God. If, for example, the Lord \napproved Israels murmuring against Pharaohs tyranny, then, as just \ncause existed for the colonists complaints against Parliament, it \nwas not wrong for them to rebel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the turn to Scripture with the most impact did not come from the \npulpit; it came from Thomas Paines (17371809) explosive tract, \nCommon Sensemuch of it devoted to biblical interpretation. This call \nto arms, first published in early 1776 and reprinted at least 20 \ntimes that year, urged colonists uneasy about Parliaments actions to \nabandon monarchical government altogether. Paine found proof in 1 \nSamuel 8, where God condemns Israel for choosing Saul as king. \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthors loyal to King George III rushed to print counterarguments: \nfor instance, Deuteronomy 17:1420 says God himself would give Israel \na king, and at least five New Testament passages (such as 1 Peter \n2:17) command something very different than rebellion. But Paines \nexceedingly evocative prose carried the day. \u0014\n\u0014\nDual implications\u0014\nThe Bible of the American republic reflected the history of four \nearlier periods. These periods shared an approach that would prove \ncrucial in the Revolution: reading Scripture simultaneously as a book \nof eternal salvation and a book with implications affecting life in \nthe world. The first era was the Reformation. At his famous \nappearance before the emperor at Worms in 1521, Martin Luther \n(14831546) boldly proclaimed, my conscience is captive to the Word \nof God. Although the phrase sola scriptura was not much used until \nlater, the principle emerged alongside Protestantism. Protestants \nhave never been able to agree exactly on what Scripture requires its \nreaders to believe or to do. But they have agreed that the Bible \ndeserves supreme honor as the book of salvation. \u0014\n\u0014\nFour years after Luthers famous declaration, William Tyndale \n(14941536) published his landmark New Testament in English. It \nprovided much of the language eventually incorporated into the KJV. \nTyndale began his preface to that New Testament by declaring that a \nBible in the peoples language is a light . . . to them that walk in \ndarkness, where they cannot but stumble, and where to stumble is the \ndanger of eternal damnation. Because it sets forth the way of \nsalvation, Gods revelation in the written Word should be honored \nabove every other religious and secular authority. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Tyndales translation, the most popular version in England and \nScotland was the Geneva Bible (15571560), in use during the second \nera of biblical\u0014\n\u0014\ninterpretation guided by Puritan influences. This version was \ndistinguished by its accessible price, memorable prose (much of it \nindebted to Tyndale), extensive marginal commentary, and pioneering \ndivision into individually numbered verse-paragraphs. This greatly \nfacilitated use of Scripture but also encouraged an unfortunate \ntendency to chop biblical narratives into bits.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the Geneva Bibles marginal notes simply explained obscure \nmaterial, but some encouraged readers to disobey their monarch when \nnecessary. Christopher Goodman (15201603), one translator, \nunderscored that revolutionary message with How Superior Powers Ought \nto be Obeyd of their Subjects; and Wherein they may lawfully by Gods \nWorde be disobeyed and resisted (1558). He and other ardent \nProtestants had fled to Europe when the Catholic Mary Tudor became \nqueen in 1553 and began to silence Englands Protestants. \u0014\n\u0014\nTransfixed by salvation\u0014\nMany English settlers who colonized the New World agreed. The Bible \nopened for them the way of salvation; it also encouraged them to \ndisobey rulers, parliaments, or traditions that in their minds \nviolated the Scriptures. In Of Plimouth Plantation, William Bradford \nargued: \u0014\n\u0014\nWe desire to have the right worship of God and discipline of Christ \nestablished in the church, according to the simplicity of the gospel, \nwithout the mixture of mens inventions; and to . . . be ruled by the \nlaws of Gods Word, dispensed in those offices, and by those officers \nof Pastors, Teachers and Elders, etc. according to the Scriptures. \u0014\nOther Puritan colonies were more explicit. When the Massachusetts Bay \nColony drafted the Body of Liberties in 1641, instead of citing \nlegal precedent or tradition, it gave biblical chapter and verse for \nmany laws, backing each provision for capital punishment with a text \nfrom the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the colonies included several types of Protestants and a few \nCatholics, the Puritans were the most articulate, energetic, and \nideologically influential settlers. They wanted above all to follow \nscriptural teaching. Just as important for their later influence, \nthey regarded their own settlements as in some way analogous to \nancient Israel. And they refused to let any top-down authority tell \nthem what the Bible means.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevivals that swept over much of colonial America in the 1730s and \n1740s ushered in the third era, which added an evangelical component. \nSome of the Great Awakenings opponents, like Charles Chauncy \n(17051787) of Boston, argued that the Bible condemned the disorder \nhe perceived when preachers like George Whitefield (17141770) came \nto town. Whitefields great popularity and the preaching of \nlesser-known evangelists carried a different (and livelier) message. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor his part Whitefield always based his sermons on the Scriptures, \ncalling them the unerring rule of God. His fame, however, rested on \ntransfixing audiences by dramatizing the Bibles story of salvation. \nListeners gathered not at regular Sunday worship hours, but on work \ndays in fields, public squares, and natural amphitheaters. His way of \nproclaiming the new birth spoke personally and powerfully to ordinary \nmen and women, to the enslaved as well as to the free. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo notable women in Newport, Rhode Island, Sarah Osborn (17141796) \nand Susanna Anthony (17261791), spread these evangelical influences. \nTheir deep appropriation of the revivals scriptural truths made them \neffective Bible teachers, beloved spiritual mentors, and highly \nrespected mothers in Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Edwards (17031758) became the Great Awakenings most \nimportant theologian; his encyclopedic grasp of Scripture guided his \npreaching and philosophizing. The way other revivalists applied \nscriptural preaching to reach the lost would, however, exert a \ngreater influence in shaping the religious future.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new empire\u0014\nFinally, the most immediate influence for the use of Scripture in the \nRevolutionary period was imperial. For decades the British Empire had \nused Scripture to justify a never-ending series of wars with Europes \nCatholic powers, many of them fought on American soil: Drummers War \n(17221725, against French-backed Native Americans); the War of \nJenkins Ear (17391748, against the Spanish); King Georges War \n(17441748); and the French and Indian War (17541763). These \nconflicts brought anxiety, conflict, and sometimes brutal destruction \ninto colonists daily lives. As Americans looked to Scripture for \nguidance, their earlier traditions supported a powerful merging of \nbiblical loyalty with libertarian political philosophy. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1749 the governor of New Jersey asked pastor and renowned \nrevivalist Gilbert Tennent (17031764) to preach a sermon celebrating \nBritish victory in King Georges War. Tennent took his text from \nPsalm 65:1 and included a lengthy tribute to English Protestant King \nWilliam III who in 1688 had replaced Catholic James II. According to \nTennent that decisive act paved the way for King George II, the \nprincipal . . . Pillar of our Hopes, and Source of our Joys, as well \nas the Terror and Envy of our Enemies. \u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Davies (17231761), learned revivalist, hymn-writer, and \nchurch organizer, preached several sermons to rouse Virginians near \nthe start of the French and Indian War. He took his text for one from \nJeremiah 48:10, exploiting the Puritans metaphorical identification \nof Britain with the children of Israel. On the one side stood the \nSpirit of Patriotism . . . the inestimable Blessings of Liberty, \nBritish Liberty. On the other were arrayed the French, those \neternal Enemies of Liberty . . . the horrid acts of Indian and popish \ntorture . . . arbitrary Gallic power . . . Popish Slavery, Tyranny, \nand Massacre . . . the Chains of French Slavery. The imperial wars \nfixed this absolute contrast in many minds. France, tyranny, poverty, \nvice, the pope, and disregard for Scripture presented a stark \nexistential threat against Britain, liberty, prosperity, virtue, \nProtestantism, and obedience to the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut what if Britain later turned out to act like France? What if \nParliament tyrannized the colonies? Beginning with the Stamp Tax \n(imposed to recoup expenses from the French and Indian War), that \nseemed to be exactly what was happening. Now the new Patriot cause \nwas the Pillar of our Hopes, and Source of our Joys, as well as the \nTerror and Envy of our Enemies. \u0014\n\u0014\nProtestant instincts to hold Scripture as an authority higher than \nkings, the Puritan tradition likening the new nation to Israel, \nevangelical disregard for inherited authorities, and a view of the \nworld encouraged by imperial wars could have only one result. That \nresult was the Bible of the American republic. CH\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Mark A.

    "title": "RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION OF ANY KIND IS DECLINING",
    "words": "By Aaron Earls, Lifeway Research\u0014\n\u0014\nLess than half of Americans say they belong to a house of worship, \nmarking the first time, since Gallup began collecting data in 1937, a \nmajority arent part of a church, synagogue, or mosque.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious membership was stable throughout the 20th century but fell \nfrom 70% in 2000 to 47% in 2020. While this should cause concern \namong church leaders, the situation may be less dire than it appears.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2020, religious membership dropped below 50% in the U.S. for the \nfirst time since Gallup began tracking such information.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, what explains this significant membership drop? Three factors can \nhelp churches better understand the religious landscape in the United \nStates and how to reach their changing communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nRise in nones\u0014\n\u0014\nUndeniably, fewer Americans say they belong to a religion, much less \na specific religious institution. According to Gallup, nones (those \nwho choose none of the above when asked their religious \npreference), have grown from 8% in 2000 to 20% in 2020. The General \nSocial Survey (GSS) noted an increase from 14% to 23% in the same \ntime frame. Pew Research tracks the growth from 17% in 2009 to 26% in \n2019.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be noted that the growth is not driven primarily from a \njump in atheists or agnosticsboth only saw modest 2-point increases \nin Pews findings. Similarly, the percentage of Americans who say \nthey dont believe in God inched upward from 3% in 2000 to 5% in \n2018, according to the GSS. Instead, as Pews data found, those who \nare simply nothing in particular climbed from 12% in 2009 to 17% in \n2019.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowth of the religiously unaffiliated in the U.S. does not primarily \ncome from a jump in atheists or agnostics, who only grew by 2 \npercentage points in the past 10 years. Among those without a \nreligious preference, Gallup foundas expectedfew (4%) say they have \na formal church membership. This means that as more Americans fail to \nidentify with a religion, more Americans will choose not to identify \nas a member of a church.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstitutional rejection\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch membership is falling, but so are numerous other official ties \nto organizations. Americans are increasingly wary of institutions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another Gallup survey, the percentage of Americans who say they \nhave quite a lot or a great deal of confidence in the church or \norganized religion dropped almost 15 points in the past 20 years. \nWhile 42% say they trust the church, thats down from 56% in 2000. \nBut other groups and institutions have seen significant declines in \nthe past two decades: TV news (18 points), newspapers (13 points), \nCongress (11 points), big business (10 points), banks (8 points), \nSupreme Court (7 points), and police (6 points).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen seeking to add to their membership or even maintain current \nlevels, congregations are fighting an uphill battle against the \nculture's anti-institution tendencies.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, Americans dont trust the leaders of those institutions. \nFewer than half of U.S. adults say judges (43%), bankers (29%), \njournalists (28%), labor union leaders (24%), local officeholder \n(24%), lawyers (21%), state governors (20%), state officeholder \n(19%), business executives (17%), senators (13%), and members of \nCongress (8%) have high or very high honesty and ethics, according to \nGallup.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong pastors, public trust has fallen precipitously since the turn \nof the century when 64% of Americans gave them high ratings for their \nhonesty. In recent years, that number has fallen below 40%. In the \nmost recent survey, 39% had a positive opinion about the ethics of \nclergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Americans have a negative view of institutions, including \nchurches, and they lack trust in the leaders of those institutions, \nincluding pastors, it is no wonder church membership has dropped in \nrecent years. When seeking to add to their membership or even \nmaintain current levels, congregations are fighting an uphill battle \nagainst cultural tendencies.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch clarity\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing up, I remember the sign above the piano in our small country \nchurch that announced numbers like last weeks Sunday School and \nworship service attendance, as well as our church membership. While \nwe only hit triple digits on a good Sunday, our membership number \nalways stayed above 300. Many of those in church today wont have \nthat same experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile membership has undergone a precipitous drop, the decline in \nreligious service attendance has been much less severe, according to \nGallup. In 2000, 44% of Americans said they attended a service in the \nlast seven days. That fell to 34% in 2019. In Gallups other church \nattendance measurement, 46% of Americans said they attended a \nreligious service at least almost every week in 2000. In 2020, 33% \nsaid the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther surveys measuring church attendance find even smaller declines. \nAccording to the GSS, 38% of Americans attended religious services at \nleast two to three times a month in 2000. That dipped only \n2-percentage points to 36% by 2018.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe social benefit of maintaining a church membership is \ndisappearing. While there is obviously something lost when a culture \ndrops much of its Christian influence, the church is also granted a \nclarifying opportunity. Now more than ever, church leaders know who \nis part of their congregation. As membership numbers decline, they \nmove closer to actual attendance numbers and give churches a more \naccurate picture of their congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile church membership may be falling, its not taking the sky down \nwith it. As more nominal Christians become nones and culture \ncontinues to avoid institutional ties, pastors and church leaders can \nsee who truly is a follower of Christ and who in their community they \nneed to reach with the gospel. This should be an opportunity for \nprayer and faith, not one of panic and fear.\u0014",

    "title": "RABBINIC JUDAISM --TORAH PEOPLE",
    "words": "Rabbinic Judaism is the mainstream form of Judaism today, preserving \nthe tradition of the Pharisees. After the Second Temple fell in AD \n70, leaders called rabbis codified the traditions known as oral Torah \ninto writing and passed on the tradition that Moses had received not \nonly as written but also as oral Torah at Mount Sinai. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe term rabbi primarily means a teacher of Torah. Rabbis study the \nTalmud as well as Jewish law and worship and may also take courses in \nmodern pastoral subjects such as counseling and preaching. They often \nlead congregational worship, but their primary roles are as teachers \nand experts in the law.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first five books of Moses are known collectively as Torah, or \nPentateuch. This is referred to as written Torah. The term can also \nbe used more broadly to refer to Jewish writing and tradition, called \noral Torah. Making a rule or practice stricter than what is \nexplicitly in Torah is often called building a fence around Torah, \nbased on Deuteronomy 22:8, to avoid the possibility of transgressing \nGods commands. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe entire group of Jewish sacred writings is called the Tanakh, \noften referred to in English as the Hebrew Bible or Hebrew \nScriptures. While the content is essentially equivalent to the Hebrew \nand Aramaic text of the Protestant Old Testament, the books are \ndivided differently; Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, \nand the 12 Minor Prophets make up one book each, and the books appear \nin a different order. The Masoretic Text, which dates from c. 800 to \n1100, is considered the authoritative text of the Tanakh.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo major collections of oral Torah into writing exist: the Mishnah, \ncollected in the late second century by Judah ha-Nasi, and the \nGemara, a record of commentaries and debates on the Mishnah. Together \nthey are called the Talmud. There are two versions, the Jerusalem \nTalmud and the Babylonian Talmud.\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbis and others interpret the sacred writings through a kind of \ninterpretation called midrash. It focuses mainly on a close \nexamination of the text in light of the tradition of interpretation \nby previous rabbis. Haggadah is midrashic commentary on Torah that \ntakes the form of storytelling. Much midrash is in this form. Some \nmidrash is halakha, the set of religious laws that explain what \ncounts as carrying out Gods commandments. At the core of halakha are \nmitzvoth, biblical commandments of behaviorthere are traditionally \nconsidered to be 613 commandments in Torah. Halakha also includes \ncommentary and discussion on these commandments. One of the \nbest-known examples of halakha is the set of Jewish dietary laws \nknown as kashrut; food conforming to these laws is called kosher. \u0014\nThe synagogue is the primary place of Jewish worship, reading of the \nTanakh, study, and prayer. Normal public worship and some other \nactivities require the presence of a minyan, or quorum of 10; in \ntraditional Judaism this must be 10 men, but in Reform and \nConservative Judaism women may be counted.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday Jewish people fall into three major geographical divisions. \nAshkenazi Jews descend from those who migrated first to the Holy \nRoman Empire (modern Germany) and then to Eastern Europe. (Yiddish, \ntheir traditional language, combines Germanic and Hebrew influences.) \nSephardic Jews descend from those who migrated to Spain and Portugal. \nMizrahi Jews are considered to be those from the Middle East, \nalthough the exact application of the term is controversial.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour major divisions of belief and practice exist within rabbinic \nJudaism. Orthodox Jews are the most traditional branch, believing \nthat Torah and Talmud have been faithfully transmitted and should be \nobserved strictly. One well-known subdivision is Hasidic Judaism, \nwhich arose in the 1700s in Poland and spread to the United States. \nIt combines ecstatic kabbalah teachings (see p. 21), Orthodox \npractices, and Eastern European cultural customs. \u0014\n\u0014\nReform Judaism developed in the early to mid-nineteenth century with \nan emphasis on ethical principles and on Gods continuing revelation, \nsimilar to that found in Protestant liberalism of the time. \nConservative Judaism developed after Reform to create a middle \nground; its adherents maintain generally traditional practices but \nare also open to adaptation. Reconstructionist Judaism is a branch of \nthe Conservative movement that broke away in the mid-twentieth \ncentury. It values traditional practices as expressions of Jewish \nculture.\u0014",

He \nstudied at the Westminster School for a while, but was sent to \nIreland in 1755, the same year as his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nToplady suffered from tuberculosis. As his death neared, he sensed \nGod's presence. \"O what a day of sunshine this has been to me! I have \nnot words to express it. It is unutterable. O my friends, how good is \nGod!\" The day he died, he was calling, \"Come, Lord Jesus, come \nquickly!\" He told his friends that he could not live much longer for \nno mortal man could live after seeing the glories of God that he had \nseen. He was not quite thirty-eight when he died on this day, august \n11, 1778, but his short life-span was enough to produce one of the \nmost beloved of all hymns--Rock of Ages:\u0014\n\u0014\nRock of Ages cleft for me,\u0014\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\u0014\nLet the water and the blood\u0014\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed\u0014\nBe of sin the double cure;\u0014\nCleanse me from its guilt and power.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is said to have come to him when he stepped into a cleft of \nrock to take shelter from a storm, but the evidence does not bear \nthis out. The first appearance of that particular story was 70 years \nafter his death. More likely the hymn came from his meditation on God \nas our rock, which was a frequent theme in his sermons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew if any today read the the sermons or other books Augustus Toplady \nwrote, but we still sing his hymn. It has remained a favorite. Sung \nin churches or at home, it speaks of Christ's mercy to all ages.\u0014",

    "title": "RICHMOND'S MASSIVE UNTOLD STORY",
    "words": "The Stain of Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Benjamin P. Campbell   8/7/21  Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nThirty thousand Virginians were killed in the Civil War. Three \nhundred thousand were sold downriver from the Richmond slave market.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut only the Civil War prominently is public in Richmond. The silence \nsurrounding the slave market is deafening.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is nothing new. Silence was an essential part of Richmonds \ndownriver slave trade. Nothing was said of it publicly when it was \ngoing on. Fully half of the citys economy  more than the commonly \ntouted tobacco or iron or flour industries combined  was tied up in \nthe sale of human beings at Shockoe Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than 135 years after the slave pens were emptied, nothing \nwas said in Richmond or Virginia about it. We heard that Richmonds \nConfederate hospitals cared for as many as 10,000 wounded men at a \ntime during the Civil War. We didnt hear that an average of 15,000 \nmen, women and children were tortured, imprisoned and shipped into \ndeadly commerce in Richmond each year for at least 20 years before \nthat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other libraries, you could find the story that somehow didnt come \ninto Virginia. In 1931 Frederic Bancroft had written 30 detailed \npages on the Richmond slave market in his epic history work, Slave \nTrading in the Old South. But in Richmond, in the classic histories \nof Virginia, in the monuments and museums and historic markers, in \nthe tourism brochures  silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story began to come to light two decades ago, as the city formed \na Slave Trail Commission, and as citizens began to explore what had \nbeen identified on an old map as the Negro Burial Ground. But the \nmost dramatic moment was the discovery in 2005 and the excavation in \n2008 of the Lumpkins Slave Jail in Shockoe Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foundations and courtyard of the jail were intact. It was deep in \nthe swamp of Shockoe Bottom, hidden away in the floodplain, miserable \nand ugly from 10 to 50 feet beneath the interstate highway and \nparking lot  the 20th centurys way of keeping the secret.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was only one of at least five massive slave jails; only one of 30 \nauction houses; and only one of perhaps 200 businesses  clothiers, \ninsurance agents, doctors, barbers, brokers  that filled Shockoe \nValley from the James River to Broad Street and from Capitol Hill to \nChurch Hill with this evil, life-destroying, capital-generating \ncommerce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scale of the slave market is matched only by the magnitude of the \ndenial. One hundred fifty-six years later, there still is a secrecy. \nToday the Richmond slave market still is just a paragraph in the \nhistory, a footnote on the city map.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is about to change  just a little. The city is putting forth a \nShockoe Small Area Plan that acknowledges the slave trading district, \nLumpkins Jail and a burial ground, and calls for them to be set \naside in a Heritage District.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this is only the beginning. SmithGroup, the consultants who \ndesigned the National Museum of African Amerian History & Culture on \nthe National Mall in Washington, D.C., are in the process of \ndesigning a major Museum of the Downriver Slave Trade for the site of \nLumpkins Jail.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis museum will be prominent and fully visible, right next to the \ninterstate highway that buried much of the slave market. It will tell \nthe story of bondage and liberation, which must be told if Richmond \nis to move forward to truth and equity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt will not tell it quietly. It will tell it dramatically, at a scale \nthat rivals the scale of Richmonds other historic monuments. The \nprice tag is more than $100 million, but in context that is small for \na Richmond museum. It is less than the amount now being paid just for \nexpansions at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture and the \nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts.\u0014\n\u0014\nScale is at least part of the issue. Hiddenness always was the \nstrategy. It is convenient. In many circles, it is polite. But it is \nabsolutely wrong, catastrophic, if carried into the future. A tiny \nslave museum would continue the big lie, the 21st centurys way of \ncontinuing to guard the secret.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe excavated Lumpkins Jail will be the ground floor of the museum  \nnow visible for all of the world to see. Above will be powerful \ndisplays and narratives of a trade that involved three times as many \npeople as were brought to America from Africa. The Heritage District, \nthe burial ground, the Slave Trail and walking tours will be anchored \nin the museum and spread throughout Shockoe Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wont be easy to build the museum.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jail was half-hidden from sight on the worst land in the city  a \nmiserable, flood-soaked parcel called the Devils Half-Acre. They put \nit in the swamp so it wouldnt be seen  and that is exactly why we \nmust make it visible. Some of the archeology still might be under the \nSeaboard building, a turn-of-the-century transfer facility that sits \non the parking lot next to Main Street Station.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe city will need some special permissions from the Army Corps of \nEngineers, because of the flood plain, and from the governments \nhistoric watchdogs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the engineers and designers will have to do some serious work to \nrelate to flooding that still might come. But SmithGroup put the \nAfrican American museum in a bathtub 60 feet deep because the \nNational Mall once was a swamp  and the same can be done in Richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt must be done here. A major national slavery museum can and will be \nbuilt in Richmond. Down the hill and behind the state Capitol where \n300,000 citizens deliberately were sold in a swamp, the hidden truth \nmust be told. Scale is essential. This story is big. Hiding it again \nwill destroy us.\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin P. Campbell is pastor emeritus of Richmond Hill, a pastoral \nassociate at St. Pauls Episcopal Church and the author of \nRichmonds Unhealed History. Contact him at: benjaminpva@gmail.com\u0014",

    "words": "Refugees Never Lose Longing for Home\u0014\nby Imam Imad Enchassi | Aug 25, 2021 | Good Faith Media\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a refugee.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Oct. 23,1983, I held hope, in the form of a plane ticket, in my \nhand. This paper was what was going to help me flee Beirut and get to \nthe United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat same morning, a yellow Mercedes truck entered the parking lot of \nBeirut International Airport, drove into the U.S. Marine barracks \nadjacent to the airport, and exploded, killing 241 military personnel.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy hopes of leaving an already war-torn country violently imploded.\u0014\n\u0014\nI did eventually make it to America, but I can empathize with those \nin Afghanistan feeling trapped by borders of violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know what its like to feel trapped in a house where all four walls \nare on fire. And for those who are making their way into the U.S. and \nneighboring countries, I know the anxiety, hope, fear and longing \nthat comes with that, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatching images on TV of people fleeing brings about those raw \nfeelings for me, as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I finally left Lebanon, I was a 17-year-old boy, alone and \ninexperienced in overseas travel. I was excited to start a new life \nin America, but I was also full of anxiety  not knowing if I would \never be able to see my friends and family again.\u0014\n\u0014\nWould they survive whatever future violence I was leaving behind? \nWould my mother be able to meet my future children?\u0014\n\u0014\nWould I be accepted in the culture? Would I fit? If I did fit in, \nwould I lose my identity in assimilation?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the U.S. is seen around the world as a land of plenty and \nopportunity, no one wants to leave home. Not truly. And not forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember vividly my mother sending me off, saying she hoped our \nfamily name would live on elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nI still remember my heart tearing as we released each other from that \ngoodbye embrace. She told me a mothers heart would rather see her \nkids leave for a better future than stay and give her comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one wants to leave home. But when home becomes a living hell, you \ndream of a better life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is what we must remember about the Afghan refugees and others we \nsee coming into our country.

It was a struggle to find a mosque; there werent any Islamic \nschools or organizations to help with acculturation.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, there are many more ways Muslim refugees can engage with other \nMuslims, and we even now have members of the faith engaged in \npolitics and leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a different world today and much easier to practice and be \nopenly Muslim. But the desire to return home can never be quenched.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo matter how bad the situation on the ground is in Lebanon, I still \nlook for any excuse to visit home every chance I get. I swear, I \nbecome a child again every time I go back.\u0014\n\u0014\nHome is home, no matter how bad it has treated you. No matter how \nmuch it oppressed you and left you wanting more.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough we leave home, home lives within us.

    "title": "RICHARD BAXTER WAS BORN TO PREACH AND WRITE",
    "words": "\u0014\nRichard Baxter Born to Preach and Write\u0014\n \u0014\nWHEN RICHARD BAXTER WAS BORN in Shropshire, England, on this day, 12 \nNovember 1615, the state of religion in England was low. In Baxters \nbirth-town Eaton-Constantine, the gospel was poorly read and seldom \npreached. He would set a different standard when he became a pastor. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut at first that seemed far off. As a youth he was a liar and a \nthief consumed with pride, frivolity, and disobedience. His father \nhad become a Christian through reading the Bible and led a more godly \nlife than most of the pastors for miles around. He tried to guide his \nson to do the same. \u0014\n\u0014\nBaxter's early schooling, however, proved not to be the best way to \nlead him to Christ. His schoolmasters were ministers who read Common \nPrayer on Sundays and Holy Days, and taught school and tippled \n(drank) on the week-days, and whipped the boys, when they were \ndrunk. However, when Baxter was about fifteen, someone loaned his \nfather Bunnys Resolution, a serious call to Christian living which \nBaxter read. He came under the conviction of sin, began to pray, read \nother Christian books, and changed direction. He studied to become a \npastor. About that time he also started coughing up blood, an \nindication of tuberculosis. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1641 Baxter became pastor at Kidderminster. He preached Gods Word \nand took care to visit each person in the town and speak to them \nabout their sin. The transformation of the place was astounding. \nBible reading, praise, and prayer replaced cursing, sexual \nimmorality, and drunkenness. The church had to be enlarged five \ntimes. He wrote The Reformed Pastor, explaining his methods to \nothers. In a typical sermon he said, It is a thousand pities that \nwhen God has provided a savior for the world, and when Christ has \nsuffered so much for their sins...that yet so many millions should \neverlastingly perish because they made light of their savior and \nsalvation and prefer the vain world and their lusts before them. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the seventeenth century, King and Parliament went to war with \neach other. Kidderminster was in a Royalist county, so Baxter, who \nsympathized with the Puritans, was driven out. He became chaplain to \nparliamentary (Puritan) soldiers. However, he did not get on well \nwith Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the Puritans. \u0014\n\u0014\nBaxter was persecuted by both sides in the religious and political \nquarrels of the day and went to prison several times. Nonetheless, \nhis one hundred and twenty eight books had a strong influence on the \nnation. The best-known of these was The Saints Everlasting Rest. It \nheld out the hope of eternal life as a strong motivation for \nChristian living. Keep heaven in your eye at all times, he said. \nAnother book, Call to the Unconverted, exhorted readers to turn from \nsin to a holy life. Its success led him to write a series of books \ndesigned to bring people to repentance and to set themselves apart \nfor Gods use. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe and his younger wife practiced what they preached, always helping \nothers even though they were very poor themselves. In their last \nimprisonment together, Baxters wife shared a cell with him and died \nfirst. His own death came in 1691.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

This letter\u0014\n              is an addendum to that form.\u0014\n          \u0014\n              I have known Fred professionally and personally for \nabout 2 years.  His supervision\u0014\n              with me has occurred on a weekly basis for anywhere \nfrom an hour to hour and\u0014\n              half per session. During these sessions, supervision \ninvolved the specific\u0014\n              areas of intake and diagnosis, individual clinical \npastoral counseling,\u0014\n              group counseling, and marriage and family counseling.\u0014\n         \u0014\n              With the context of the supervisory process in one to \none supervision, Fred\u0014\n              has proven to be strong and very adept in his clinical \ndiagnostic skills,\u0014\n              in his work with individual adults, and in his work \nwith couples with regard\u0014\n              to marital and couple therapy.\u0014\n         \u0014\n              In progressing toward seasoned competence as a Clinical \nPastoral Counselor,\u0014\n              Dr. Skaggs has a strong sense of personal identity and \ngood interpersonal\u0014\n              competence. I have observed him to establish quick \nrapport with clients,\u0014\n              tenderly starting the counseling process at a point \nwith which the client\u0014\n              is comfortable and building therapeutic alliance from \nthere. Dr. Skaggs\u0014\n              feels less competent in the academic and theoretical \ndimensions regarding\u0014\n              Clinical Pastoral Counseling. However, he is a \nvoracious reader of academic\u0014\n              material that would improve his counseling foundation, \nand he utilizes a\u0014\n              part of the supervision time establishing a connection \nfor his inherently\u0014\n              good clinical pastoral counseling skills in a \ntheoretical grounding.\u0014\n         \u0014\n              Dr. Skaggs clinical and therapeutic competence is \nexcellent. He takes\u0014\n              extensive social history data, is easily able to \nidentify themes and issues\u0014\n              that underpin the presenting problems, and he \nunderstands and follows  through\u0014\n              on the necessity to address both a presenting \nsymptomology and the underlying\u0014\n              processes in his treatment of his clients. He provides \na good blend of\u0014\n              supportive listening and effective confronting within \nthe context of a well\u0014\n              established therapeutic alliance. He uses a good blend \nof behavioral,\u0014\n              cognitive, and client centered techniques.\u0014\n         \u0014\n              Finally, with regard to Dr. Skaggs pastoral identity \nand ethical commitment,\u0014\n              I observe superlative qualities. Dr. Skaggs \nacknowledges his clinical\u0014\n              pastoral counseling as an extension of his pulpit \nministry. At the same time,\u0014\n              especially when his client is also a member of his \npastorate, Dr. Skaggs\u0014\n              is clear to draw a distinction between his role as the \nclients Pastor\u0014\n              and as the clients counselor. Also, he is wholly \ncommitted to the appropriate\u0014\n              ethical principles that guide his pastorate and that \nguide his practice as\u0014\n              a clinical pastoral counselor.\u0014\n         \u0014\n              I hope this information is helpful to you in processing \nDr. Skaggss application\u0014\n              for membership.

The Vermont State Police \nsaid Mr. Laundry, 31, was intoxicated and cited him with driving \nunder the influence. He says he is cooperating with the investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe spoke with gratitude about Tinsley in a phone interview on \nWednesday. Shes my guardian, Mr. Laundry said as she played with \nher squeaky squirrel toy. The night was very cold. We were in \nhypothermic conditions when they reached us.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the crash around 10 p.m. Monday night, Tinsley crossed into New \nHampshire, a mile or so away, and led the authorities back into \nVermont to the wreck, which officials said they would not have \nnoticed unless someone had seen the damaged guardrail that the truck \nhad tumbled over.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first the officers were simply trying to catch Tinsley to get her \nout of traffic on Interstate 89 after a driver reported a dog running \nloose. But she kept running north, slowing occasionally to keep the \nofficers close behind, Lt. Dan Baldassarre of the New Hampshire State \nPolice said in a statement. She eventually led them to a bridge over \nthe wreck.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a real-life Lassie story, he said, referring to the fictional \ncollie from long-running TV and radio programs who had a penchant for \nsaving humans who got themselves in trouble. Shes the hero, \nLieutenant Baldassarre said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Laundry had minor injuries, including a concussion, bruises and a \ncut on his hand that required stitches. His passenger in the Ford \nF-350 truck, Justin Connors, 40, sustained a serious neck injury and \na broken leg but was in stable condition, Mr. Laundry said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn American bulldog belonging to Mr. Connors survived the wreck but \nwas killed by oncoming traffic after the crash, Mr. Laundry said. The \nbulldogs name was Grizz, Mr. Laundry said, though he was not \nentirely sure of the spelling.\u0014\n\u0014\nTinsleys actions were hailed by officials from several responding \nagencies, some who witnessed the dogs trek to the crash site, others \nwho saw Tinsley as she stood calmly by her owner as rescuers rendered \naid.\u0014\n\u0014\nn the interview, Mr. Laundry said he did not know how the crash \nhappened and declined to say whether he had been drinking beforehand. \nHe was driving home to North Hartland, Vt., from a restaurant in New \nHampshire, about a 15- or 20-mile trip, when he hit a guardrail, the \nairbags deployed, and the car tumbled several times into the woods, \nhe said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe regained consciousness, lying in the snow, with the help of \nflashing blue lights, having no idea at the time that it was Tinsley \nwho had led the authorities to the crash.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite stories like Tinsleys, the science is not yet settled on \nwhether dogs can intentionally seek out other humans to help their \ndistressed owners.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell-supported evidence that dogs intentionally go seek help for \ntheir owners just doesnt exist yet, said Joshua Van Bourg, a Ph.D. \ncandidate at Arizona State University who studies animal cognition \nbehaviors. Thats not to say it doesnt happen, and maybe this dog \nis an example of it.\u0014",

    "title": "RUTHERFORD EXILES FOR PUBLAHING",
    "words": "Rutherford Exiled for Publishing\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL 2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nNot many pastors rise at 3 A.M. to be sure they have sufficient time \nfor God and their people. Samuel Rutherford was one who did. Thus it \ncame as a great blow to him when he was compelled to leave the folk \nhe loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRutherford had published an Apology of Divine Grace against the \nheresy of righteousness based on human works. This work offended the \ngovernment. On this day, February 20, 1636, Archbishop Laud, who \ncontrolled the established churches of Britain, exiled Rutherford to \nAberdeen. He forbade him to preach anywhere in Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem Rutherford could not be blamed if he slipped into \ndepression. The years had not been kind to him. In 1630, after barely \nfive years of marriage, his wife died following a painful illness of \nthirteen months. Their two children also died, and Samuel himself \nsuffered a debilitating fever for three months. Now he was in exile, \nexcluded from the work he cherished most.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut rather than become depressed, he wrote encouraging letters to his \nfriends and his church home. These are full of wise and pithy \nsayings: \"Duties are ours, and events are the Lord's.\" Or, \"It is not \nfor us to set an hourglass to the Creator of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hundreds of letters he wrote in exile became a classic. Full of \nencouragement and loving devotion to Christ, they showed that \nRutherford had an intimate communion with the Lord and was not afraid \nto talk about it. He always wrote about Christ and the wondrous glory \nof His Person. Charles Haddon Spurgeon later said, \"When we are dead \nand gone, let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters \nto be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the \nwritings of mere man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638 Rutherford was restored to his church. His many sufferings \ngave him even greater sympathy for the suffering in his flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1640s, Rutherford represented the church of Scotland in \nthe Westminster Assembly in London. He helped author the Shorter \nCatechism, with its famous beginning, \"What is the chief end of man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGlimpses #95.

    "title": "RACING TO ESTABLISH CHURH IN INDIA, HE BURNED OUT",
    "words": "RACING TO ESTABLISH THE CHURCH IN INDIA, ZIEGENBALG BURNED OUT YOUNG\u0014\n \u0014\nEighty-six years before William Carey began his internationally \nfamous mission work in India, Danish missionaries had introduced the \ngospel there. Bartholomew Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Pluetshau made \ntheir way to Tranquebar in 1706, sponsored by the King of Denmark. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-three-year-old Ziegenbalg rapidly learned the Tamil language \nand translated the New Testament into it by 1711. He followed that \nachievement with about half of the Old Testament. His was the \nfirst-known Scripture translation into an Indian language. \u0014\n\u0014\nZiegenbalg and Pluetshau met stiff resistance from Hindus who \ndespised Christianity because of the low morals of European \ncolonists. The local Dutch government also resisted the work of the \nDanish missionaries, fearing that their teachings and social work \nwould breed unrest. They even imprisoned the Lutheran missionary for \nfour months. This did not stop zealous Ziegenbalg from continuing his \nevangelism as soon as he was released. He met challenges by intensive \nprayer and faithfully accounted for all his activities in his \nextensive correspondence with his supporters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Danish missionaries also were undercut by Christian Wendt, \nchairman of the Danish mission, who refused to forward the donations \nthat had been contributed to the work, believing the missionaries \nshould follow the apostolic pattern of going out by twos to preach, \ntaking nothing with them. As the missionaries desperately needed \nmoney to fund schools and printing, both needed to establish an \nindigenous church in which Indians would rule themselves, their work \nwas greatly impeded. Finally, King Frederick IV of Denmark had to \nrelieve Wednt of his duties.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the loss of Pluetshau, who had to leave the field after \nseven years, owing to ill health, and the stresses of dealing with \nWendt had seriously undermined Ziegenbalgs health. He died at \nthirty-six years of age on this day, February 23, 1719, leaving a \npregnant wife and two children.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his thirteen years of service in India, he had accomplished much. \nIn addition to his translation work, he had helped plant several \nschools, including the first girls school in India, established a \nseminary, converted and baptized over two hundred Indians, operated \npresses, prepared dictionaries, published a Tamil grammar, collected \nTamil manuscripts, trained a future generation of Christian pastors, \nwritten several books, contributed to the worlds first mission \nnewsletter, and constructed a church building which has seen over \nthree hundred years of continuous service.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was wise in his choice of principles. These five are adapted from \na list in Stephen Neills history of Christian missions: (1) Church \nand school go together. (2) The Word of God must be in the \nChristians own language. (3) Gospel preaching must be based on an \naccurate knowledge of the mind of the people. (To achieve this, \nZiegenbalg studied Hindu culture. Among his books was Genealogy of \nthe South-Indian Gods, a manual of the mythology and religion of the \npeople of southern India, including a description of popular \nHinduism.) (4) The mission must aim at definite, personal conversions \nand (5) The Indian church must take responsibility for itself as soon \nas possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Race and the Meaning of Religious Liberty\u0014\nTimothy Golden January/February 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Black Americans, traditional narratives around religious freedom \nare complicated by both historical and present realities. Is there a \npath toward a shared understanding?\u0014\n\u0014\nRace. Just mentioning the word makes us uncomfortable. Race is the \nproverbial elephant in the room for many in their daily livesthat \never-present reality that most prefer to ignore, hoping that it will \njust go away. We do not want to confront race, because it demands \nconfronting a long and brutal history of racial violence that is not \nsimply a matter of historical record. It is a history that has been \ninstitutionally preserved and transmitted to subsequent generations \nin ways that perpetuate Black suffering on one hand and maintain \nWhite dominance on the other. Indeed, it seems that not only is race \na permanent fixture in our daily lives but also that racismits \ntroubling and dangerous institutional derivativeis an intractable \nfeature of American life. America is thus trapped between two forms \nof discomfort: the discomfort of race and racism in daily life and \nthe discomfort of confronting race and racism. Either way, we are \nuncomfortable.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur discomfort has led us to try different ways to solve Americas \nrace problem so that we no longer must deal with race. One such \nsolution is to deny race; to argue that race is neither scientific \nnor genetic. If race is not a genetic reality, the argument goes, \nthen when we speak of race we are literally talking about nothing. \nOn this account of race, one can critique any discussion of raceor \nracismby arguing that we are discussing something that simply does \nnot exist. Conversations about race might as well be about the great \npumpkin, the tooth fairy, or some other childish fiction. But this \nview is somewhat naive and oversimplified, for even if science is \ncorrect about the nonexistence of race on a genetic basis, how do we \naccount for the highly racialized world in which we live? \u0014\n\u0014\nA Social and Political Reality\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that American social and political life reflects a material \nreality in stark contrast to our scientific denial of race. Myriad \nsocioeconomic indicators suggest that poverty and wealth, cultural \nphenomena, social benefitsand burdensexist in tangible ways that \ndemonstrate that race not only exists but also is an organizing \nprinciple of American life. From disparities in health care to those \nin the administration of criminal justice, education, and the ongoing \nstruggle to secure voting rights in federal law, the examples of the \nsocial reality of race abound despite its scientific denial. There \nmay not be a race gene, but the reality of race, both socially and \npolitically, is indisputable. Indeed, no Black person I know is \nprepared to walk into a Ku Klux Klan meeting and boldly declare that \nrace does not exist. Race is a social and political reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccompanying the social and political reality of race is the \npractical reality that race informs much of what we do, either \nconsciously or unconsciously. We live in a world in which race and \nracism shape not only our attitudes toward others but also our \ninterpretations of words and phrases, including the phrase religious \nliberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nExtremes of Political Ideology\u0014\n\u0014\nTo an American White evangelical, the phrase religious liberty \ntypically implies that Christianity is under attack from social and \ncultural forces that demand its genuflection at the altar of a \nmulticultural Baal that regards neither religion nor liberty. The \naim of this social and cultural idol is to persecute White Christians \nthrough American law. The ultimate result will be to replace them \nwith a cultural religion completely antithetical to the Bible, \nfundamentally changing their Christian and American way of life. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this view, religious liberty implies a sacred connection between \nthe founding narrative of the United States and Christianity in which \nboth are understood as compatible with each other. As such, the aim \nof the state is to vindicate and protect the practices of the church \nat any and all costs, even if it means that other religions take a \nbackseat to Christianity in constitutional interpretation. This view \nimplies that left-wing, activist judges are the bane of American \nlaw and social life and must be avoided at all costseven at the cost \nof political consensus. So if presidential nominees to the federal \njudiciary are now confirmed in the Senate on partisan votes, so be \nit. Long gone are the days when such justices as Antonin Scalia and \nRuth Bader Ginsburg, the former considered to be a right-wing \nconservative and the latter considered to be a left-wing liberal, \nwere confirmed 98-0 and 96-3, respectively. Since Christianity is \nunder attack, we need Supreme Court justices who understand the \nurgency of the moment, so broad-based political consensus is no \nlonger an option. The admixture of church and state is perfectly \nacceptable on this view so long as it is the Christian church that is \nbuttressed with the power of the state. For White evangelicals, then, \nreligious liberty often means securing their own religious \n(Christian) liberty as a zero-sum game: Christianity wins while other \nreligions lose.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe irony of this White evangelical view is that it exposes a racist \nhistory of American Christianity and its troubling relationship with \nAmerican politics that many in the White evangelical community would \nrather ignore. But its a history Black Americans have both \nexperienced and embraced: the relationship that allowed for the \nstate-supported theological justifications of the American slave \ntrade. These justifications ranged from the Hamitic cursethe notion \nthat Black people were cursed with lives of servitude for Whites \nbecause they are the descendants of Ham, who mocked Noah, his \nfatherto the argument that slaves could be baptized because although \ntheir souls belonged to God in heaven, their bodies belonged to their \nmasters on earth. This uniquely American strain of Christian theology \nwas heavily invested in justifying what Frederick Douglass often \ncalled the peculiar institution of American chattel slavery. When a \nBlack person hears the phrase religious liberty, then, it is seen \nin a context of oppression at the hands of state governments that, \nsince the end of Reconstruction, have been openly hostile toward \nthem, and a federal government that has responded unevenly at best.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering this oppression, the phrase religious liberty, for \nBlack Americans, implies a struggle against an oppressive religion in \nthe name of liberation. White evangelicals, because of their \nexperiences, understand religious liberty to mean preservation of a \nracialized status quo that maintains their position atop the social \nand political hierarchy through an affiliation with hyperconservative \npolitical ideology. In contrast, Blacks understand religious liberty \nto imply an emancipatory politics that will break the chains of \nreligious oppression in the interest of liberation. Black Americans \nthus espouse resistance to oppression in the form of prophetic \ndiscourses that interpret the Black American experience in Christian \ntheological terms. One sees this in the religious thought of W.E.B. \nDuBois and the Black liberation theology of James H. Cone,1 who often \nsaw Jesus as a biblical representation of Black Americans. Even as \nthe Hebrew slaves before them confronted Pharaohs oppression and \nwere delivered from bondage, Black Americans must experience an \nexodus, finding relief from the American pharaohs of police \nbrutality, mass incarceration, and voter suppression. Unlike White \nevangelicals, for whom religious liberty implies a maintenance of the \nstatus quo, for many Black American Christians religious liberty \nimplies a disruption of the status quo in the interest of liberation. \nThe contrast is striking. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is another Black interpretation of religious liberty that \nimplies a rejection of the religious altogether in favor of liberty. \nOverlooking the prophetic discourse of Black Christianity, on this \nview of religious liberty notions of liberty eclipse the religious \naltogether because of American Christianitys  historical role in the \noppression of Blacks, indigenous persons, Latinos, and other people \nof color. And it is this eclipse of religion in the interest of \nliberty that translates into a left-wing political ideology that is \nso preoccupied with liberty and so hostile to religion that it sees \nas antagonistic to American democratic norms and institutions.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the rank ideology at work in attempts to pack the Supreme \nCourt. Rather than return to the democratic norm of a two-thirds \nconfirmation vote in the Senate for federal judicial nominees, some \non the left with admirable but ultimately misguided egalitarian \nracial agendas have suggested politicizing the Supreme Court by \nallowing political affiliation to expand the amount of justices on \nthe Court. So controversial is this proposal that it has drawn \ncriticism from Justice Breyer, one of the Courts liberal justices.2 \u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking Moderation\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical extremes are ineffective because they merely reinforce \nrigid and uncompromising worldviews, which makes for a polarized \nsocial and political culture. In this environment, the broad-based \npolitical consensus that is so essential for constructive public \npolicy is difficult to attain and government suffers amid the rancor \nof ideological extremities. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur Western literary, philosophical, and Judeo-Christian heritage has \nwarned us about the dangers of extremes. Greek mythology tells the \nstory of Icarus, whose father, Daedalus, made Icarus wings of \nfeathers and wax, telling him to avoid flying too high, as he would \nbe too close to the sun, which would melt his wings, causing him to \ndrown in the sea. Likewise, warned Daedalus, flying too low would \nproduce the same result. For Icarus to safely reach his destination, \nhe needed to fly at a midpoint between the extremities of the sun and \nthe sea. The lesson here is that an excess of ambition brings one too \nclose to the sun, while a deficiency of ambition brings one too close \nto the sea. Instead of these extremes, one must fly moderately to \narrive safely at ones destination. This literary lesson has a Greek \nphilosophical analogue in Aristotles Nicomachean Ethics, in which he \nargues that virtue is found at a mean between two extremes. A classic \nexample is the virtue of courage, found at a mean between the \ndeficiency of cowardice and the excess of foolhardiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd when Jesus heals the woman with the issue of blood who touches \nthe hem of His garment, He is healing a woman who has had an issue of \nblood for 12 years. Recall that in the Gospel account, this miracle \noccurs while Jesus is on His way to heal a young girl who has been \nalive for as long as the woman who has had the issue of blood. These \ntwo women thus represent extreme positions, and Jesus, who says that \nHe felt virtue (d??a??) leave Him when the woman touched the hem of \nHis garment, was in between them. This Greek word is transliterated \nas dunamis, implying moral power and excellence of soul. The takeaway \nhere is significant: whereas there is only weakness and sickness in \nthe extremities, there is power and moral excellence in between the \ntwo. Attaining this power and moral excellence implies that we must \nseek the mean between extremes to prevent racial interpretations of \nreligious liberty that translate into the destructive influence of \nextreme political ideologies.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Politics to the Political\u0014\n\u0014\nThe space of moderation that our Western moral and theological \nheritage urge us to inhabit is what I will call the Political. The \nPolitical is a social arrangement of people under an authority who \nhas the capacity to make and enforce law. The Political is ubiquitous \nthroughout Scripture. In the book of Genesis Adam and Eve abided in \nthe Political because they were a community of persons socially \narranged under an authority (God) with the capacity to make law (do \nnot eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) \nand enforce law (the day you eat of the tree you shall surely die). \nThis social arrangement persists throughout Scripture and is seen in \nPharaohs Egypt, Israels captivity, and the deliverance of Gods \npeople in the book of Revelation. In each of these instances, one \nsees a God who is intimately connected to history in the form of \nliberating His people from Pharaoh, sending His prophets with \nmessages of warning and judgment, and establishing His kingdom anew. \nAt every turn, the God of the Bible is a God that entrusts His \ncreation to administer justice in the realm of the Political, but \nwhen we fail, God is there to pick up the slack.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd this is our mission today: to abide in the Political, pursing \njustice for all those in need. Although it is good for the church to \nstay out of politics, the church cannot help being part of the \nPolitical, which is a major part of its creed and the place in which \nwe find a measure of hope for the recalcitrance of our \ninterpretations of religious liberty, not because race no longer \nexists, but because our understanding of the human condition is \nbrought into sharper focus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a space much broader than political ideology, we can now \nreconcile our ideological differences in the interest of the common \ngood. This is not a naive, postracial utopia. No. Indeed, in the \nPolitical, both Black and White will continue to have differing \ninterpretations of religious liberty and robust policy disagreements \nbased on their differing historical and social realities. And far \nfrom denying the reality of systemic racism, the realm of the \nPolitical enables Whites to see issues of oppression not through a \nnarrow ideological lens, but rather as issues of the utmost moral and \nspiritual urgency that demand our social and political attention, \njust as they did in Scripture. Again, race is acknowledged in the \nPolitical and is accompanied by an ever-increasing moral energy \ndirected outward at injustice rather than inward toward bolstering \nones narrow ideological commitments.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Way Forward\u0014\n\u0014\nRace has an inevitable effect on how we interpret the meaning of \nreligious liberty. This effect drives us toward political extremes \nthat prevent constructive public policy. A possible way out from \nthose extremities is to engage the concept of religious liberty \nwithin the context of the Political rather than politics, for the \nPolitical enables us to see one another as citizens in the kingdom \nof God, a political arrangement based not on ideological expediency \nbut instead on the moral imperative to love God as seen in plight of \nothers, and to love the neighbor as we love ourselves. The simplicity \nand breadth of these moral imperatives from our Judeo-Christian \nheritage acknowledges both racial differences and their corresponding \nhistories, while viewing the injustices of these histories as issues \ndemanding everyones moral energyboth Black and White.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\n1 W.E.B. DuBois may seem an odd fit with Black theologians like Cone, \nespecially considering his Communist affiliation and his open \nhostility toward religion in some of his work. But it would be a \nmistake to think that DuBois is hostile to religion as such for two \nreasons. First, as a sociologist, DuBois was deeply interested in the \nsociology of religion and its impact on both his life and Black \nlifean impact that he believed to be uplifting and constructive. See \nW.E.B. DuBois, John Brown (New York: International, 1962) and The \nPhiladelphia Negro: A Social Study (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1899), \np. 21. And second, one can argue that DuBois is a pragmatic religious \nnaturalist: one who is hostile to an overemphasis on religions \nontological commitments in favor of an emphasis on religious \nstories, moods, symbols, rhetoric, and moral values because they are \nlinks to the past, because they are powerful tools and narratives for \nshaping and envisioning life, and because they can allow for a type \nof spirituality that emphasizes the fallibility, fragility, and power \nof the human-made ties that bind us and make us dependent on each \nother (Jonathan S. Khan, Divine Discontent: The Religious \nImagination of W.E.B. DuBois [New York: Oxford University Press, \n2009], p. 13).\u0014\n\u0014\n2 See Stephen Breyer, The Authority of the Court and the Peril of \nPolitics (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2021). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle Author: Timothy Golden   Liberty Magazine, Jan-Feb 2022\u0014\nTimothy Golden, Ph.D., is professor of philosophy, legal studies \nprogram coordinator, and director of the Donald Blake Center for the \nStudy of Race, Ethnicity, and Culture at Walla Walla University.

    "title": "RESPONSE TO \"DIVORCE WITHOUT NOTICE\"",
    "words": "ANGELA\u0014\nMy initial feeling after reading this was being upset because it \nbrought back hurtful feelings that I didn't really want to relive or \nthink about again.  Even though our situations were nowhere near as \ntragic as all of the lost baby issues which are very difficult for a \nrelationship to survive, the woman in the article must have had \nmissed signs.  (Article was called Divorce without Notice.)   I \ncertainly had many warnings and red flags that \"warned\" me my \nmarriage was in trouble which just extended the pain and \ndisappointment for years (rather than just getting a note on the \nkitchen counter.)      \u0014\n\u0014\nI do remember one of the most painful parts was feeling like I was \nfailing God, my parents and my family by getting a divorce.  I often \nthought of how hard it must have been for Debbie being the first in \nthe family to get a divorce.  It took a year and half of counseling \nfor me to \"accept\" and admit that I couldn't \"keep a covenant someone \nelse has broken.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\nI love the idea of the symbolic \"ceremony\" surrounded by \nfriends/family of placing the ring on the altar and giving the \npromise back to God.  (Good counseling advice.)  We all did that in \nour different ways.  I made a video for Christy in which I took my \nrings off and put them on the table with a clicking sound.  However, \nit is still disturbing that the Bible says if you get divorced, you \nare an adulterer. The only comfort is that God forgives us. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll I could say to this woman is, \"Forgive yourself, ask God for \nforgiveness and he will forgive you too.  It's not your fault; you \ndon't deserve it; life is not fair; you will survive with God's \nhelp.\"  And with fingers crossed behind my back, I'd add, \"your \nchildren will be okay.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce hurts!  The everlasting pain, inconveniences, embarrassment, \netc. that is imposed on the children which never can truly be \nexplained and never goes away as children/adult children, and their \nchildren have to go to two households for holidays, etc.  It never \nends.  \u0014\n\u0014\nSo the real question is.... Is it better to divorce or to stay in an \nunhealthy relationship?  Sometimes things get better and change; \nsometimes the violator grows up.  Many, many women have waited it \nout, but at what cost? \u0014\nThere are no concrete answers which is why it is so upsetting.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------\u0014\nCINDY\u0014\n\u0014\nHey Dad. I think I can share a few comments but first a question.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou said, \"The ending of this article is different than anything I've \never been a part of.\"  What does that mean? I think the last \nparagraph exactly describes what your daughters went through, and I \nthink it's exactly why I was emotionally abused by Jimmy because he \nknew I believed that. My strong desire to make the marriage stay \ntogether had nothing to do with happiness at the time but rather my \nreligious beliefs. He played on that and my forgiveness time and time \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy mistake was not ending it much earlier. I didn't realize I wasn't \nrespecting myself.  I used to look back and kick myself for it, but I \nwas young, sweet, innocent and kind back then.  I didn't have a mean \nbone in my body, and I didn't know how to fight the person who I \nvalued as much as myself. The truth is Jimmy did not value me, and he \nwas also not the christian man we both thought he was.  Jimmy \nsuppressed many things, like his desire for black women, until well \nafter he was out from under his parent's wings and family pressure \nwhich was after college. (We married 3 months after college.)  It may \nwell be that he only married me out of what he thought his family \nexpected from him. He was too young emotionally to get married, and \nhe and I both didn't see that. He is the most self-centered person \nI've ever met.  Maybe there were signs, but most of these things \ndon't come out until after the wedding.\u0014\n\u0014\n As far as Rich goes, there is no doubt in my mind now that he will \nnever be happy with anything for long (job, houses, cars, people).  I \nthink it's sad, but he will always be a rolling stone. He's now again \ngoing through another divorce.  He is very smart and physically and \nmentally tough - just a survivor if there ever was one - but there's \na screw loose somewhere. He is also the most generous person I've \never met. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther Comments:\u0014\n1.  I think I speak for all three of your daughters when I say that \nwe don't want to talk about our divorces or failed marriage(s) \nbecause for one, they were bad and traumatic experiences; two, there \nwas pain and some lingering painful memories involved, and three they \nwere very different lifetimes ago and we have buried them. We are \ndifferent people now.  My friend Donna has been a widow for 30+ \nyears.  She once said, \"When I Iook back, I feel like it was a \ndifferent lifetime.\" I replied because it was just as each of my \nmarriages were different lives.\u0014\n2.  People can be very judgmental about divorce even still today. \nThat's also hurtful although most people who haven't been divorced \nare clueless about divorce. I believe there are many reasons why \nmarriages end, and I am convinced that there are just as many reasons \nwhy bad marriages stay together. \u0014\n4.  I don't think \"to love you as I love no other\" works unless you \nget married very young and even then, maybe it should be \"I'll love \nyou as much as I love myself\".  For example, it doesn't work in a \nsecond marriage where children, whether minor or grown adults, are \ninvolved and maybe it shouldn't or maybe it depends. I don't know. I \njust think it doesn't happen.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think the woman in the article went through the same feelings as we \ndid, and in the end, her struggle made it his decision.\u0014\n\u0014\nI just saw Angela's response, and I agree with everything especially \nabout how difficult it was for Debbie being the first.\u0014",

    "title": "ROGER WILLIAMS OBTAINED RHODE ISLAND'S CHARTER",
    "words": "Roger Williams Obtained Rhode Island's Charter\u0014\n \u0014\nSEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND had fewer religious rights than Americans \nare accustomed to today. Catholics, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans \noften went to prison or even died for their beliefs. Other Christians \nfled to the American colonies to escape persecution. Among them was \nRoger Williams.\u0014\n \u0014\nRoger Williams was a controversialist. Although he was ordained in \nthe Church of England, his Puritan views soon forced him out of that \nchurch. He migrated to New England in 1631. However, Bostonians also \ntook issue with him, for he rejected leadership of one of their \nchurches for keeping ties to the Church of England. Williams plainly \nannounced that the godly must separate from the ungodly. He also \nproceeded to offend the governments of Salem and Plymouth by \ndeclaring it was wrong for them to take Indian land without paying \nfor it. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, he struck at the root of colonial governments by insisting \nthat no civil power had the right to judge the convictions of mens \nsouls. Most Puritan authorities believed government was required to \nenforce godliness and protect true religion. Consequently, \nMassachusetts exiled Williams in 1635. After wandering several weeks \nin the bitter cold, he settled at Narragansett Bay, purchasing land \nfrom the Indians, whose language he learned. He named the city he \nfounded there Providence, Rhode Island. From the start, Providence \nPlantations offered liberty of conscience to people who were \npersecuted elsewhere. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen other New England colonies refused to allow Providence \nPlantations to join their league for common defense against Indians, \nthey claimed it was because the colony had no charter from England. \nActually, they considered the colonys religious tolerance a form of \nanarchy. The city council of Providence asked Roger Williams to \nobtain a charter. \u0014\n\u0014\nDetermined, he sailed to England to get it. On this day, 14 March \n1643, the British Parliament granted a charter to Providence \nPlantations in the Narragansett Bay of New England. (The date is \noften given as 1644 owing to Britains adoption of the Gregorian \ncalendar in 1750 that changed New Years Day from 25 March to 1 \nJanuary.) \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his visit to England, Williams wrote an impassioned plea for \nfreedom of conscience. Giving civil authorities power over religious \nconvictions of its subjects encourages people to be hypocrites, he \nwrote: What slaughters both of men and women must this necessarily \nbring into the world by the insurrections and civil wars about \nreligion and conscience? Yea, what slaughters of the innocent and \nfaithful witnesses of Christ Jesus, who choose to be slain all the \nday long for Christ his sake, and to fight for the Lord and master \nChrist only with spiritual and Christian weapons? Although the 1643 \ncharter said nothing about religious liberty, it protected the colony \nfrom its neighbors. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams remained contentious to the end. He abandoned Puritanism and \nwas a founder of Americas first Baptist church, but moved even \nfarther from churches and creeds in his last years. Providence \nPlantations eventually became known as Rhode Island and was a model \nof toleration, separation of church and state, and self-government.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams himself abandoned Puritanism and the Baptist church he had \nhelped found (the first in America), opposing all sects and creeds.\u0014",

    "words": "ROBERT RAIKES MADE A TIME AND A PLACE FOR KIDS TO LEARN\u0014\n \u0014\nImagine this: two hundred years ago, even great nations like Britain \ndid not educate the majority of their children. One of the people who \nchanged that was Robert Raikes, publisher of the Gloucester Journal. \nIn a letter, he described the start of his world-changing work:\u0014\n\u0014\nSome business leading me one morning into the suburbs of the city, \nwhere the lowest of the people ... reside, I was struck with concern \nat seeing a group of children, wretchedly ragged, at play in the \nstreet. I asked an inhabitant whether those children belonged to that \npart of the town, and lamented their misery and idleness. Ah! Sir, \nsaid the woman to whom I was speaking, could you take a view of this \npart of the town on a Sunday, you would be shocked indeed, for then \nthe street is filled with multitudes of these wretches, who, released \non that day from employment, spend their time in noise and riot, \nplaying at chuck [a throwing game], and cursing and swearing in a \nmanner so horrid, as to convey to any serious mind an idea of hell \nrather than any other place. \u0014\n\u0014\nRaikes already used his influence and time to improve conditions in \nGloucesters prisons. Now he wondered if he could do something to \nhelp the children. As he considered this, the word TRY impressed \nitself on his mind. He talked it over with Rev. Thomas Stock. Stock \nhad run a Sunday school in Ashbury, Berkshire. Raikes and the \nclergyman agreed on a plan to hire four women to teach the children \non Sundays. The change for the better in the children was above their \nhighest hopes. In 1783, Raikes published an article about the \nGloucester Sunday schools in his newspaper. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis article drew attention all over Great Britain and people wrote \nwith inquiries. A popular mens magazine printed one of his replies. \nThe idea was a hit. People had founded Sunday schools before, but \nRaikes was the first to promote the idea to the nation. Volunteers \n(many of them motivated by Christian faith) formed Sunday schools \nacross Britain. Hundreds of thousands of children learned to read and \nto lead self-disciplined lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrganizers often went beyond mere book education. One man encouraged \nchildren to bring a penny every Sunday toward buying new clothes. He \nmatched the amount for anyone who did. (A penny in 1800 was worth \nabout 50 US in 2020.) The children responded eagerly. After a few \nweeks, many came dressed in new outfits. They had learned that it \npays to save a little each week toward a worthwhile goal.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn anecdote shows Raikess way of handling children. A sullen girl \nwas giving her mother fits. The mom complained that discipline was \nineffective. After asking the mothers permission, Raikes pleaded \nwith the girl to seek forgiveness as a step toward changing course. \nThe girl refused. Well then, said Raikes, If you have no regard \nfor yourself, I have much regard for you. You will be ruined and lost \nif you do not begin to be a good girl, and if you will not humble \nyourself, I must humble myself, and make a beginning for you. He \nknelt before the mother and asked forgiveness. No sooner did the girl \nsee him on his knees for her sake than her heart melted. She fell on \nher own knees and afterward was quite changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the evening of this day 5 April, 1811, Raikes felt a heaviness in \nhis chest. A physician came at once but could give no hope. Raikes \ndied before the hour was up, seventy-five years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nRaikes changed millions of lives through his willingness to try \nsomething new. He used the means available to him to tell the world \nof his success. That is why he wrote, \u0014\n\u0014\nI can never pass by the spot where the word TRY came so powerfully \ninto my mind, without lifting up my hands and heart to heaven, in \ngratitude to God, for having put such a thought into my heart.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

All three were being held without bail, according to jail \nrecords.\u0014\n\u0014\nA police spokesman did not name the church. The Mercury News of San \nJose, which reported details of the exorcism this month, identified \nit as the Iglesia Apostoles y Profetas, a small Pentecostal church \nthat holds services in the back room of a multifamily home.\u0014\nExperts say that faith in miracles is common in Latino \nPentecostalism, but exorcisms are highly unusual and very rare. The \nauthorities said the defendants in the San Jose case were trying to \ninduce the girl to vomit to expel what they believed was an evil \nspirit possessing the toddler.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl, identified in court papers as Arely Doe, died of \nasphyxiation, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County coroners \noffice said last week. She added that the death was ruled a homicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police became aware of the exorcism shortly after 8 p.m. on Sept. \n24, when Ms. Hernandez-Santos called 911 to report that Arely had \ndied, according to a statement of facts signed by a San Jose police \nsergeant that was submitted as part of the case against her. \nEmergency medical workers arrived and took Arely to a hospital, where \nshe was pronounced dead less than an hour after the call, the \nauthorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police statement, relying on interviews with the girls \nrelatives, says Ms. Hernandez-Santos began to believe her daughter \nwas possessed by a demon on the night of Sept. 23, when Arely \nrepeatedly woke up, screamed and cried. Ms. Hernandez-Santos and her \nbrother prayed for Arely and took her to the church around 6:30 the \nnext morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir actions at the church took an increasingly violent form, \naccording to the police reports. Ms. Hernandez-Santos stuck her \nfinger down her daughters throat while squeezing the girls neck to \ninduce vomiting, which Ms. Hernandez-Santos believed would drive out \nthe evil spirit. At some point, Arelys grandfather arrived, and the \nthree adults began to take turns holding Arelys neck, abdomen and \nlegs with the intent to make her vomit, the police said.\u0014",

    "words": "RASALAMA, MADAGASCARS HEROIC MARTYR\u0014\n \u0014\nIN 1824 the London Missionary Society set up schools in Madagascar. \nSeven years later, in May 1831, they held their first baptismal \nservice for new Christians. The following month, on this day 5 June \n1831, the Christian converts celebrated the Lords Supper for the \nfirst time. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who participated in the solemn rite held in the \nAmbatonakanga church was a young woman named Rafaravavy Rasalama. Six \nyears later she would become one of the most famous names among \nMadagascars nineteenth-century Christian minority. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1837 Queen Ranavalona I took the throne. Fearful of foreign \ninfluence, she outlawed Christianity. Learning of Rasalamas faith, \nshe arrested her. Officers tricked Rasalama into revealing the names \nof seven other Christians, pretending to double-check her account \nagainst others to see how truthful she was. When a relative expressed \nsurprise that Rasalama had betrayed her friends, she was horrified to \nlearn that her innocent statement had led to their arrest. However, \nfor herself she had no fear. I have hope of life in heaven, she \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnlookers attributed her firmness to the influence of secret \nmissionary witchcraft. Her words of faith and hymn-singing aroused \nthe anger of her captors. They bound and beat her and then fastened \nher overnight in irons by her feet, hands, knees, and neck in a \nposition that caused excruciating pain. This torment was called omby \nfohy, meaning the shortened bullock, because it was similar to the \nway an animals fore and hind legs were bound for slaughter. The next \nday she was taken out to die at Ambohipotsy. When she passed the \nchapel in which she had been baptized, she exclaimed, There I heard \nthe words of the Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe walked the last distance to the place of execution, singing hymns \nand praying. There she requested permission to kneel and pray and, \nsurprisingly, it was granted. Soldiers speared her in the hips, a \npractice that often resulted in a slow, painful death. But in \nRasalamas case, death came quickly. She was the first of many \nMalagasy martyrs. The soldiers expressed perplexity at her \nfearlessness and concluded some charm in the religion of the whites \nmust take away the dread of death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the persecution ended, Christians built a church in Rasalamas \nhonor at the site of her execution. Her bravery also garnered \ninternational respect. English admirers placed a plaque in her memory \nin Brunswick Chapel, Bristol, England. And in 1937 filmmaker Philippe \nRaberojo (known as Raberono) filmed the commemoration of the \ncentenary of her death, and in 1947 produced La Mort de Rasalama (The \nDeath of Rasalama\u0014",

    "title": "RAPTURE CULTURE: LEFT BEHIND IN EVANGELICAL AMERICA",
    "words": "RAPTURE CULTURE:LEFT BEHIND IN EVANGELICAL AMERICA:  - Amy Frykholm\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the \"twinkling of an eye\" Jesus secretly returns to earth and \ngathers to him all believers. As they are taken to heaven, the world \nthey leave behind is plunged into chaos. Cars and airplanes crash and \npeople search in vain for loved ones. Plagues, famine, and suffering \nfollow. The antichrist emerges to rule the world and to destroy those \nwho oppose him. Finally, Christ comes again in glory, defeats the \nantichrist and reigns over the earth. This apocalyptic scenario is \nanticipated by millions of Americans. These millions have made the \nLeft Behind series--novels that depict the rapture and \napocalypse--perennial bestsellers, with over 40 million copies now in \nprint. In Rapture Culture, Amy Johnson Frykholm explores this \nremarkable phenomenon, seeking to understand why American \nevangelicals find the idea of the rapture so compelling. What is the \nsecret behind the remarkable popularity of the apocalyptic genre? One \nanswer, she argues, is that the books provide a sense of\u0014\nidentification and communal belonging that counters the \"social \natomization\" that characterizes modern life. This also helps explain \nwhy they appeal to female readers, despite the deeply patriarchal \nworldview they promote. Tracing the evolution of the genre of rapture \nfiction, Frykholm notes that at one time such narratives expressed a \nsense of alienation from modern life and protest against the loss of \ntradition and the marginalization of conservative religious views. \nNow, however, evangelicalism's renewed popular appeal has rendered \nsuch themes obsolete. Left Behind evinces a new embrace of technology \nand consumer goods as tools for God's work, while retaining a protest \nagainst modernity's transformation of traditional family life. \nDrawing on extensive interviews with readers of the novels, Rapture \nCulture sheds light on a mindset that is little understood and far \nmore common than many of us suppose.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"An informative, brightly written analysis of apocalyptic sentiment \non the popular level. This is a most interesting book and an \nimportant contribution to the growing literature on \nevangelicalism.--Randall Balmer, author of Mine Eyes Have Seen the \nGlory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America\u0014\n\u0014\nRapture Culture offers fresh and illuminating insights into one of \nthe most significant cultural phenomena of our era, the explosion of \ninterest in biblical prophecies of the end times. Drawing on in-depth \ninterviews, Amy Johnson Frykholm shrewdly explores the popular \nreception of the bestselling Left Behind prophecy novels as readers \nshare their responses in the context of family, church, and other \nsocial networks. This eminently readable book explores the \ninteraction of contemporary American religion, cultural politics, \ngender issues, and the mass media. Highly recommended. --Paul S. \nBoyer, author of When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in \nModern American Culture\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This fascinating book is a one-of-a-kind look at how people read \nreligious literature. Thoroughly engaging, it asks us to consider the \nimportance of imagination in the construction of a spiritual life. \nThe author gives us an inside view of often conflicting \ninterpretations that Christians give of the drama of the End \nTimes.\"---Colleen McDannell, author of Material Christianity: \nReligion and Popular Culture in America\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Frank\u0014\nRapture Culture by Amy Johnson Frykholm explores both the reactions \nof readers to the Left Behind series, and the historical and societal \ncontext of the readers and the authors of this series, which has sold \nso phenomenally. Amy Johnson Frykholm provides excellent background \nmaterial on the roots and growth of the evangelical movement in \nAmerican popular religion over the last 150 years. She also explains \nrapture belief and its historical development both in its predominant \nform of dispensational premillenialism and less common forms of \ndispensational belief.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrykholm shows that belief in the secret rapture of true believers in \nJesus Christ draws believers together not only into their church \ngroups, but forms them into a distinct culture within the larger \nsociety. She explores the way this rapture culture affects the \nrelationships of believers among themselves, with their families and \nwith those outside the culture. She also shows how the rapture \nculture produces strongly homogeneous political convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrykholm explores the background and convictions of the authors of \nthe Left Behind series, Timothy LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. Much of the \nbook is a fascinating and illuminating discussion of the varieties of \nreactions of readers to the books, drawn from a series of interviews \nby the author with a diverse cross-section of readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining \ninsight into the large segment of evangelical Christianity which \nholds the doctrine of the secret rapture of Jesus Christ which sets \nthese evangelicals apart from other evangelicals and mainline \nProtestant Christianity as well as from Catholic and Orthodox \nChristianity. While those who hold the rapture doctrine seem to \nrarely demonstrate willingness to examine their beliefs, those who do \nnot hold this doctrine should find this an exceedingly helpful tool \nfor understanding the rapture culture\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Stacey\u0014\nMs Frykholm provides her informative analysis with sympathy toward \nthe people/movement/phenomenon she observes. Her work neglected to \nnote that the Scofield Bible which is held by many as the cornerstone \nof Rapture teaching was (if my information is correct) published \noriginally by Oxford. She failed to compare evangelical Christian \nculture in America before and after the adoption of \ndispensational/rapture theology. She also presumes that someone \nconverted by a book would have an interest in documentation. That is \nrarely the case. A couple of my friends became evangelical Christians \nafter contact with the teaching of Hal Lindsey. And even though both \nare socially prominent in the community and unashemed of their faith, \nI don't believe they have ever publicly credited Hal's theology. \nWhile one can sympathize with Ms. Frykholm's desire, I have never \nseen people who get salvation from endtime theology highlight the \nbook that caused them to become Christians. Rather they concentrate \nmore on the Bible, their new social contacts in their church, and \nperhaps on more \"prophecy\" study. It would also have been nice \ncontrast the endtimers' social networks with either some non-endtime \nevangelicals social networks or perhaps a non-evangelical's social \nnetwork. Nonetheless, this book probably is one of the very few that \ntreat a large part of Americans' beliefs/lifestyle seriously and \nought to be read by every thinking evangelical and every \nnon-evangelical that wants a better grasp of rapture culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy Frykholm is an American writer whose four books of non-fiction \nhave covered the territory of American religion from apocalypticists \nto saints. She is an award winning writer and editor for the magazine \nThe Christian Centur\u0014",

    "title": "RECONCILING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOSPEL OF MARK AND JOHN",
    "words": "Reconciling Differences between Two Canonical Gospels\u0014\n\u0014\n          Scholars have come to believe that some of the stories of \nJesus life in the New Testament Gospels contain discrepancies \nbetween each other. Consider, for example, the Gospels of Mark and \nJohn.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Gospels of Mark and John both give readers an account \nof when Jesus was crucified in relation to the Last Supper though \nthe nature of this meal differs. Mark specifically refers to the \nevent as the Passover meal, while John does not.\u0014\n                 \u0014\nBoth Mark and John give us a precise description of when, in \nrelationship to the Passover meal, Jesus was crucified.\u0014\n         \u0014\nBoth Mark and John indicate that Jesus died during the Feast of the \nPassover, the annual festival celebrated by Jews in Jerusalem to \ncommemorate the events of the  Exodus. The festival had as its \nbackground the stories of Gods deliverance of his people Israel from \ntheir slavery in Egypt, through Moses, as recorded in the book of \nExodus in the Hebrew Bible. In Jesus day, the festival was a major \nevent. Jews         came from around the world to celebrate the feast \nin Jerusalem. They would arrive a week in advance to undergo a ritual \nof purification that would allow them to eat the meal. They needed to \nbe ritually pure for a week, and so theyd come a week early.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe afternoon before the Passover meal was eaten, Jews would bring a \nlamb, which was to be eaten as part of the celebration, to the \ntemple, or else they would purchase a lamb there at the temple so \nthat it could be sacrificed by the priests. The rest of the day was \nspent in preparing the meal for that evening. That day, when they \nprepared the meal, therefore, was called the day of preparation for \nthe Passover. Now, its important to remember that in Jewish \nreckoning, a new day begins not at midnight as it does for us, but \nwhen it gets dark. Even today, Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday \nevening at dark and continues through Saturday until it gets dark \nagain.\u0014\n         \u0014\nDuring the festival, after the lambs were sacrificed, their blood \ndrained, they were given back to the Jewish worshipers, who took them \nhome to cook them for the meal, which was then eaten after it got \ndarkthat is, on the day of Passover itself. The meal itself \nconsisted of several symbolic foods to recall Israels slavery in \nEgypt and deliverance by God.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Mark on the Last Supper\u0014\n\u0014\n         Now were ready to compare in detail two Gospel accounts of \nJesus arrest and trial. The comparison is interesting, because both \nMark and John give us a precise description of when, in relationship \nto the Passover meal, Jesus was crucified. Lets         begin with \nthe earlier account, the account of Mark.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The day before his arrest, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus \ndisciples ask him where they are to prepare, for themselves and \nJesus, the Passover meal (Mark chapter 14, verse 12). Jesus gives \nthem instructions. This, then, is taking place on the day of \npreparation for the Passover. They prepare the meal. That night, they \nhave it. At the meal, Jesus takes the symbolic foods of the Passover \nand instills new significance in them. He takes the bread and says, \nThis is my body. He takes the cup of wine         and says, This \nis the cup of the new covenant in my blood. Afterward, according to \nMark, Jesus goes out to pray. Hes betrayed by Judas Iscariot, handed \nover to Jewish authorities for trial, and spends the night in jail.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The next morning, that is, the morning of Passover, the day \nafter the lambs were slain, the morning after the Passover meal had \nbeen eaten, Jesus appears before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, \nwho finds him guilty of criminal charges and orders         him \nexecuted. Jesus is immediately taken off and is crucified.  According \nto Mark chapter 15, verse 25, it takes place at 9:00 in the morning. \nAnd so Jesus is executed at 9:00 in the morning the day of the \nPassover, the day after the lambs have been killed         and eaten.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Johns Version of Events\u0014\n\u0014\n         This dating of the event in Mark stands in stark contrast \nwith what we find in the Gospel of John. Here, too, Jesus has a last \nmeal with his disciples, but in John theres no word of it being a \nPassover meal. The disciples in this Gospel never ask Jesus         \nwhere they are to prepare the Passover for him, and Jesus does not \nspeak about the symbolic foods in a new way at this meal. He has a \nlast meal, but theres no word about it being a Passover meal.\u0014\n\u0014\n           After the meal, again, he goes out to pray. Hes betrayed \nby Judas. Hes arrested. He spends the night in jail, and the next \nday he appears before Pontius Pilate. Were told that the Jewish \nleaders who are his accusers refuse to enter Pilates residence \nbecause they dont want to become ritually defiled and so prevented \nfrom eating the Passover meal that evening:  chapter 18, verse 28. \nEat the Passover meal that evening? Hadnt they already eaten the \nmeal the night before?\u0014\n\u0014\n          The problem is clarified at the end of Jesuss trial, when \nwere told exactly when he was condemned and led off to be executed: \nJohn chapter 19, verse 14. Pilate pronounces his condemnation of \nJesus, and were told now that it was the day of preparation for the \nPassover. It was about noon. The day of preparation for the Passover? \nHow could it be the day of preparation? According to Marks Gospel, \nJesus lived through that day, had the Passover meal with his \ndisciples that evening, and was put on the cross the next morning, on \nthe day of Passover itself. In Johns Gospel, though, Jesus was \nexecuted before the meal even began.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Its probably impossible to reconcile this discrepancy if \nyou want to explain how both accounts can be historically accurate. \nJesus is killed at a different time, on a differ-         ent day, in \nJohn than in the Synoptics. It is possible to explain, however, why \nthe discrepancy came about.      \u0014\n\u0014\n                         Making Jesus the Lamb of God\u0014\n\u0014\n         The Gospel of John is the only Gospel of the New Testament \nthat explicitly identifies Jesus himself as the Lamb of God who \ntakes away the sins of the world.         These are the words of \nJohn the Baptist, in John chapter 1, verse 29. He says the same thing \nseven verses later: Behold the Lamb of God. This is also the only \nGospel         in which Jesus is said to die on the afternoon of the \nday before the Passover, precisely when the lambs were being \nslaughtered.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          In the judgment of most scholars, it appears that John has \nchanged a historical datum in order to make a theological point. That \nis to say that hes changed the day and the hour of Jesuss death \nprecisely to show that Jesus really was the Lamb of God, who was \nslain on the same day and at the same hour and at the hands of the \nsame peoplethe chief priests, who slew the Passover lambs.\u0014\n\u0014\n          This is one kind of evidence to suggest that the Gospels \ncontain some accounts that cannot be historically accurate, at least \nin all their details, because John and Mark cant be reconciled on \nthese terms, even though you can explain why you have the         \ndiscrepancy.\u0014",

    "words": "Richard Wurmbrandt Imprisoned and Tortured\u0014\n \u0014\nYOUNG RICHARD WURMBRAND, a Romanian Jew who described himself as an \natheist and a Marxist, stole to get food when he had to as a child, \nbecame a successful businessman, married Sabina Oster (also a Jew), \nand lived a life of self-indulgence. Worn down by destructive \nbehaviors, he contracted tuberculosis. His doctor advised him to seek \nfresh air so he moved to a mountain village. It turned out to be the \nmaking of him. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn that mountain village lived an old man named Christian Wolfkes, \nwho longed to win a Jew to Christ. He had been praying that God would \nbring a Jew to him. When the Wurmbrands arrived, Wolfkes and his wife \nshowed them love. They gave Wurmbrand a New Testament which he \nhesitantly began to read. Coming face-to-face with Jesus Christ, he \nand Sabina converted to Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring World War II, Nazis repeatedly arrested and beat the \nWurmbrands for their faith. Sabinas entire family perished in the \nHolocaust. The Wurmbrands attempted to send their six adopted \nchildren to safety overseas but their ship was lost. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe end of World War II brought new sorrows when Russians occupied \nRomania and the country became Communist. In 1945 the Communists \norganized a Congress of Cults, a meeting where religious leaders \nwere expected to speak in support of the new atheistic government. \nMany did. Sabina urged her husband to wipe the shame from the face of \nJesus by refusing. Wurmbrand reminded her that if he did, she would \nlose her husband. Sabina replied, I dont need a coward for a \nhusband. And so Wurmbrand declared before four thousand delegates \nthat it was their duty to glorify God and Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned home to lead his underground church and promote the \ngospel among Romanias Russian invaders. He even smuggled Bibles into \nRussia, disguised as Communist propaganda. And then he disappeared. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 29, 1948, as Wurmbrand walked to church to \nprepare for morning service, two men hustled him into a van and drove \naway. He was imprisoned under a pseudonym for eight and one half \nyears and his wife and remaining son, Mihai,did not know where he was \nor even whether he was alive. Government agents, posing as \nex-prisoners, told Sabina they had witnessed her husbands funeral in \nthe Communist prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nThose were years of torture and brainwashing. For seventeen hours a \nday, repetitious phrases were dinned into his ears: Communism is \ngood. Christianity is stupid! Give up. Give up! His captors carved \nand burned his body and broke many of his bones. Sabina also was \nbrutalized for three years, imprisoned and forced to work at digging \na canal. Mihai was forced to live on the streets during part of this \ntime. Miraculously, all three survived. Released, the Wurmbrands \nimmediately returned to secret church work. Soon Wurmbrand was sent \nback to prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing his release in 1964, Western churches ransomed the \nWurmbrands from Romania. His testimony led to the formation of the \norganization known as Voice of the Martyrs which assists persecuted \nChristians around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBERING RUFFIAN",
    "words": "Remembering the Tragedy of Ruffian \u0014\nBy JACK MANN\u0014\n\u0014\nIncredible and unbelievable have been rendered bleeding, \nmeaningless things by the hucksters (and prosaists) of today, but \nthey described what the grand filly Ruffian had become 15 years ago \nFriday -- the day she had to die trying to prove she was real.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the morning of The Great Match Race at Belmont Park. In the \ntelevision-inspired hype Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure had been \nweighed, measured, scrutinized and analyzed. A horsemans glance \nwould have told him that she was bigger and stronger and, in her \nstatutory dark-bay-or-brown blackness, gorgeous. Foolish Pleasure \nwas a fine-looking bay colt, functionally designed, with just enough \nmuscle in the right places, like a middleweight contender.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Ruffian was, in all the versatile senses of the word in French, \nformidable, and people were being awed and intimidated. Female horses \njust were not supposed to be that good.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoolish Pleasure would be the instrument to put the uppity filly in \nher place. He had done nothing to deserve the job but be 3 years old \nand win the Kentucky Derby.\u0014\n\u0014\nRuffian meanwhile had won everything a 3-year-old filly ought to win, \neasily, including what is now gallantly known as New Yorks Triple \nTiara by an aggregate 25 lengths. Her past performances in 10 races \nshowed no digit but 1; no horse had ever been ahead of her.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither the Stuart Janneys who bred and owned Ruffian nor the Greers \nwho owned Foolish Pleasure had any great enthusiasm for the New York \nRacing Associations grandiose plan. Originally Ruffian was to face \nthe Derby, Preakness and Belmont winners, but the owners of Belmont \nwinner Avatar begged off, pleading that their horse was too tuckered \nfor a big race July 6. (He was then taken to Hollywood Park for the \nbig Swaps, June 29; nobody really wanted to meet Ruffian.) The owners \nof Preakness winner Master Derby were given a consolation prize for \nthe broken date, and Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure were left alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeight for age, sprinting, she could beat any horse in the world, \nsaid John Nerud. Seven years earlier Nerud had trained Dr. Fager, the \nfastest horse, up to a mile, there ever was.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Jolley put speed in his colt. Foolish Pleasure was a finisher. \nIn none of his seven 3-year-old races had he made the lead before the \nstretch, but this time he would have to run from the get-go. On \nThursday before the Sunday race, Foolish Pleasure worked five \nfurlongs in an eerie :56 2-5, about as fast as horses can run.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the knowledgeable among the 50,764 at Belmont were not surprised \nwhen they fired out of the distant chute as if they were in a \nsix-furlong sprint. Not surprised, but uneasy. The first half-mile \nwould go in :44 3-5, and they were going a mile and a quarter.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that point in his Kentucky Derby, which is a mile and a quarter, \nFoolish Pleasure was sitting 12 lengths back, watching 28-1 Bombay \nDuck cook himself in :45 2-5. The only Derby winner to shade 46 \nseconds would be the celebrated freak, Spend A Buck, 10 years later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe folly of the tactics became evident, and moot, about 100 yards \nbefore the half-mile mark. Ruffian, on the inside, dropped her head \nand swerved toward Foolish Pleasure. The maximal pressures had \nshattered both sesamoids behind her right front ankle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sesamoids are two pyramidal-shaped bones that act as a pulley \nfor the flexor tendons, imparting the horses massive power to the \ntiny pastern, connective to the hoof.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, as a veteran horseman of the school of disbelief put \nit as Ruffian lay dying, Somebody threw a fast half-mile at the \nbitch and she came unbuckled.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll eyes seemed to be on Ruffian, staggering in agony near the \noutside fence, where Vasquez had led her after jumping off. Some \npeople were running toward her, through the infield. Jockey Angel \nCordero, watching from the press box, glanced at the toteboard and \nissued a cogent footnote.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus Christ! Cordero yelled. He went in eight-and-three by his \nbleeping self!\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch was Foolish Pleasures momentum from the special speed put into \nhim that he completed six furlongs in 1:08 3-5, one fifth of a second \noff the Belmont track record. In the official racing cliche he had \nbeen allowed to run along on his own courage, without challenge or \nurging. Foolish Pleasure galloped home for the $225,000 in 2:02 4-5, \nfaster than three of the previous five Kentucky Derbys. (The $125,000 \nsecond money reverted to the NYRA, presumably because Ruffian \nfailed to finish the course.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHorses have lachrymal glands. The tears were streaming down Ruffians \nface when the ambulance delivered her to trainer Frank Whiteleys \nbarn. Dr. Manuel Gillman removed the air cast and put her bleeding \nfoot into a bucket of ice, which immediately assumed the color of \ncola. The ankle mechanism was not merely fractured, but shattered. \nEarlier in the day Gillman had said that Ruffian was the finest \nanatomical specimen he had examined in 20 years as an NYRA vet.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the doctors proposed to do was heroic, and quixotic. It was \nmanifest that Ruffian would not race again, but there was a chance, \nhowever remote, that she could be saved for breeding. She was such a \nmagnificent individual (the term for extraordinary conformation) \nand she had the best blood of Nasrullah on her paternal side and \nNative Dancer on the bottom line.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Dr. William O. Reeds hospital, across Longfield Avenue from the \nBelmont backstretch, the team of doctors strove mightily. They would \nreassemble the sesamoids as best they could and secure the ankle with \na strong cast, reinforced with wire.\u0014\n\u0014\nEspositos bar (Est. 1936), as some racing reporters learned that \nlong night, is 105 running steps from the front door of Reeds \nhospital. They became walking steps as periodic progress reports by \nthe doctors were relayed through John Espositos two pay phones.\u0014\n\u0014\nApproaching 2 a.m. it seemed that Johns liquor license might be in \njeopardy. Only four reporters remained (for the record, the other \nthree were Jerry Green of the Detroit News, Ken Denlinger of the \nWashington Post and Chris Scherf of United Press International), but \nRuffians crisis had not passed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hospital remained closed to the media. Dr. Alex Harthill, as \nspokesman at the door, had reiterated the principal peril. Ruffian \nwas such a strong and energetic animal, and she would be so confused, \npanicked and pained when she emerged from the powerful anesthesia \nthat her impulse might be violent. If she kicked the cast off, they \ncould not apply another. She could not survive more anesthesia.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe has to help us, Reed said. Only she can save herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Edward Keefer, the people doctor of the team, was reiterating \nthe possibilities at 2:25 a.m. when the door behind him opened and a \nlarge arm, with the sleeve rolled up above the massive bicep, reached \nout and clutched Keefers shoulder.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have a problem, Dr. Bill Reeds voice said. The fixation ...\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fixation had come unfixed as Ruffian revived and rebelled.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remaining reporters were allowed into the outer office. A door to \nthe next room was open. Frank Whiteley, 60 going on 90, slumped deep \nin a stuffed chair, a study in gray. It had been eight hours and 20 \nminutes since post time of a race that did not last 44 seconds. \nWhiteley had just performed the formality of advising his owners that \ntheir splendid animal had to be humanely destroyed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheyre going to put her down, said Bill Johnson, a NYRA publicity \nman, his voice near a sob.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then it was done and it was 3 oclock in the morning, with one \nmore call to make in the phone booth.\u0014\nBob Creamer, the editor at Sports Illustrated, took the dictation. He \nknew something about greatness. He has written definitive books \ncalled Babe and Casey. Creamer asked only one question.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, he was told. She was on the lead.\u0014",

    "title": "RISING NUMBERS BELIEVE LIFE EVOLVED WITHOUT GOD",
    "words": "Rising Numbers of Americans Believe Life Evolved Without God\u0014\nby Craig Nash | Jul 25, 2024 |   \u0014\n\u0014\nA recent Gallup poll revealed a split among Americans on three \ndistinct ideas about human origins. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince 1982, the survey has asked respondents to identify their \nbeliefs. Their options included God guiding the development of human \nlife over the course of millions of years, human life developing over \nmillions of years from lower life forms without a God, and humans \nbeing created in their present form by God within the past 10,000 \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Americans (37%) believe God created humans in their present form \nwithin the past 10,000 years. Slightly less (34%) believe humans \ndeveloped throughout millions of years but with Gods guidance. \nAlmost a quarter (24%) of respondents said humans have evolved from \nlower life forms over millions of years without any divine \nparticipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fastest-growing group of people is those who believe there is no \nGod involved in human development. In 1982, only 9% of those polled \nheld that belief.\u0014\n\u0014\nHousehold income is a key indicator for those who believe humans have \ndeveloped without guidance from God. Only 16% of those with yearly \nincomes of $50,000 or under hold that belief. \u0014\n\u0014\nAround 27% of those who make between $50,000 and $100,000 hold this \nview. Those who make over $100,000 are slightly more likely (29%) to \nbelieve no God was involved in human development. In addition to \nincome, the poll also measured education level, religious service \nattendance, and political ideology.\u0014",

Upon \nhearing of President Ronald Reagan's death, I wrote in my own weblog, \n\"I think history will remember him as one of the pivotal leaders of \nthe twentieth century. Americans will remember him as a man of great \noptimism and good will, a leader who emerged from the common people \nand never lost his ability to connect with average men and women.

These came from the June 7 \nedition of OpinionJournal.com: \"Ronald Reagan told the truth to a \nworld made weary by lies. He believed truth was the only platform on \nwhich a better future could be built. He shocked the world when he \ncalled the Soviet Union \"evil,\" because it was, and an \"empire,\" \nbecause it was that, too. He never stopped bringing his message to \nthe people of the world, to Europe and China and in the end the \nSoviet Union. And when it was over, the Berlin Wall had been turned \ninto a million concrete souvenirs, and Soviet communism had fallen. \nBut of course it didn't fall. It was pushed. By Mr. Know Nothing \nCowboy Gunslinger Dimwit. All presidents should be so stupid. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He pushed down income taxes too, from a high of 70% when he entered \nthe White House to a new low of 28% when he left, igniting the long \nboom that, for all its ups and downs, is with us still. He believed, \nas JFK did, that a rising tide lifts all boats. He did much more, \nreturning respect to our armed forces, changing 50-year-old \nassumptions about the place of government and the place of the \ncitizen in the new America. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What an era his was. What a life he lived. He changed history for \nthe better and was modest about it. He didn't bray about his \naccomplishments but saw them as the work of the American people. He \ndid not see himself as entitled, never demanded respect, preferred \ntalking to hotel doormen rather than State Department functionaries \nbecause he thought the doormen brighter and more interesting. When I \npressed him once, a few years out of the presidency, to say what he \nthought the meaning of his presidency was, he answered, reluctantly, \nthat it might be fairly said that he \"advanced the boundaries of \nfreedom in a world more at peace with itself.\" And so he did. And \nwhat could be bigger than that?\" (Click here to read her full essay.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd let me recommend a book to you I recently finished reading: When \nCharacter Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan by Peggy Noonan (Viking \nPress).

    "title": "RONALD REAGAN",
    "words": "Ronald Reagan\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished:\tJune 7, 2004, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nRonald Reagan, who died on Saturday after his long battle with \nAlzheimer's disease, projected an aura of optimism so radiant that it \nseemed almost a force of nature. Many people who disagreed with his \nideology still liked him for his personality, and that was a source \nof frustration for his political opponents who knew how much the \nideology mattered. Looking back now, we can trace some of the flaws \nof the current Washington mindset  the tax-cut-driven deficits, the \nslogan-driven foreign policy  to Mr. Reagan's example. But after \nmore than a decade of political mean-spiritedness, we have to admit \nthat collegiality and good manners are beginning to look pretty \nattractive.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Reagan was, of course, far more than some kind of chief \nexecutive turned national greeter. He will almost certainly be ranked \namong the most important presidents of the 20th century, forever \nlinked with the triumph over Communism abroad and the restoration of \nfaith in free markets at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe profited from good timing and good luck, coming along when the \ncountry was tired of the dour pedantry of the Carter administration, \nwounded by the Iranian hostage crisis, frustrated by rising \nunemployment and unyielding inflation. Mr. Reagan's stubborn refusal \nto accept the permanence of Communism helped end the cold war. He was \nfortunate to have as his counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev, a Soviet \nleader ready to acknowledge his society's failings and interested in \nreducing international tensions.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reagan's decision to send marines to Lebanon was disastrous, \nhowever, and his invasion of Grenada pure melodrama. His most \nreckless episode involved the scheme to supply weapons to Iran as \nransom for Americans who were being held hostage in Lebanon, and to \nuse the proceeds to illegally finance contra insurgents in Nicaragua.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reagan showed little appetite for power, even less for the messy \ndetail of politics. He joked about his work habits. \"It's true hard \nwork never killed anybody,\" he said in 1987. \"But I figure, why take \nthe chance?\" His detachment from the day-to-day business of \ngovernment was seductive for a nation that had tired of watching Mr. \nCarter micromanage the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nation's 40th president was absent from the public eye for a long \ntime before his death, but his complicated legacy endures. Although \nMr. Reagan did reverse course and approve some tax increases in the \nface of mounting deficits  in stark contrast to President Bush \nnowadays  he was still responsible for turning the Republican Party \naway from its fiscally conservative roots. The flawed theory behind \nthe Reagan tax cuts. that the ensuing jolt to the economy would bring \nin enough money to balance the budget, is still espoused by many of \nthe Republican faithful, including President Bush.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of Mr. Reagan's advisers, David Stockman, later wrote that the \nreal aim of fiscal policy was to create a \"strategic deficit\" that \nwould slam the door and reduce the size of the federal government. \nSuch thinking is far too prevalent in Washington to this day, and \nhelps explain why plenty of conservatives don't seem all that \nbothered by the government's inability to balance its books.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ronald Reagan was elected, the institution of the presidency and \nthe nation itself seemed to be laboring under a large dark cloud. \nInto the middle of this malaise came a most improbable chief \nexecutive  a former baseball announcer, pitchman for General \nElectric, Hollywood bon vivant and two-term California governor with \none uncomplicated message: There was no problem that could not be \nsolved if Americans would only believe in themselves. At the time, it \nwas something the nation needed to hear. Today, we live in an era \ndefined by that particular kind of simplicity, which expresses itself \nin semi-detached leadership and a black-and-white view of the world. \nGray is beginning to look a lot more attractive.\u0014",

    "words": "Reagan's public \nvalues, public pain\u0014\n\u0014\nA famously fractured brood belied ex-president's ideal of a \nclose-knit American family \u0014\n\u0014\nBY LYNN SMITH\u0014\nLOS ANGELES Times\u0014\nWASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE\u0014\n\u0014\nRonald Reagan idealized the close-knit American family but was \nhimself an untraditional patriarch who headed a famously splintered \nbrood.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his years in public office, his children conducted family \nfeuds in public, at times openly defied his values and rarely \ngathered for public or private functions. Before reconciling in \nReagan's twilight years, they sometimes used press interviews or \nbooks to communicate with one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis daughter Patti Davis, notorious for her colorful life and \ntell-all memoirs, remarked in 1991, \"The mark of this family is that \neverybody is distanced from everybody else.. . . There was no glue in \nthis family.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorced and remarried, Reagan is survived by three children: \nMichael, adopted by Reagan and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman; \nand Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan, his children with second wife \nNancy Reagan (nee Davis), the former actress and future first lady. \nDaughter Maureen, born to Reagan and Wyman, died in 2001 of melanoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren of Hollywood before their father entered politics, they \nstruggled for attention like many celebrity offspring. They also \ntreasured private moments spent with him  especially on the family \nranch near Malibu, Calif., where he taught them to swim and ride. \nThey have described him as genuinely kind and an exceptional \nstory-teller. Maureen, who enjoyed the closest relationship with \ntheir father, said she always remembered him as the hero of her \nchildhood  \"this gorgeous, bronze Adonis.\" Michael called him \"damn \nnear perfect.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   At the same time, Reagan displayed an emotional detachment so \nsevere that the children later said they felt invisible or diminished \neven when he was around. Once Reagan failed to recognize Michael \nafter giving the commencement speech at his graduation from an \nArizona boarding school. \"My name is Ronald Reagan,\" he said to his \nson. \"What's yours?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    In 1998, Ron, known as the favored child, told a PBS interviewer \nhe had never had a real conversation with his father. In some \nrespects, he said, the frustration felt by each of the children to \ntheir father's increasing obliviousness after the 1994 onset of \nAlzheimer's disease was nothing new. \"[We] banged our head against \nthe wall  you know, 'Why can't we get any closer? Why can't there be \nmore of a rapport?' But after you accept that there just isn't going \nto be [one], then you make your peace with that...\u0014\n\u0014\nSome have attributed Reagan's remoteness to his father's alcoholism \nor to his seemingly exclusive relationship with wife Nancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael's memoir\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael, in a 1988 memoir, wrote that he spent his childhood seeking \naffection. He complained that he and Maureen were raised by nannies \nand maids; after their parents divorced, they were sent to boarding \nschool, Maureen at age 7, Michael at 5.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was only when Michael was 14 and returned to live with his father \nthat the children from his second marriage learned they had half \nsiblings from his first. \"Patti was introduced to us siblings on a \nneed-to-know basis,\" Maureen wrote in her memoir. Because their \nparents had gotten only as far as to tell Patti about Michael, \nMaureen had to break the news that they were sisters. Maureen \nrecalled that Patti, then 7, ran crying from the room.\u0014\n\u0014\nA New York Times article in 1980 noted that while the parents were \ninseparable, the family seldom gathered and the children were left to \ngo their own ways \"except when called upon to make a formal public \nappearance.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes, outsiders reportedly informed the Reagans about major \nevents in their children's lives. In 1980, reporters told them, for \ninstance, that Ron had married his live-in girlfriend, Doria \nPalinieri; a friend and a Secret Service agent served as witnesses. \nThey learned about their daughter Patti's 1986 thinly veiled novel \nbased on their lives through an item in Time magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough many of their troubles, resentments and disappointments may \nhave been no different frQm those of any family who has struggled \nthrough modern issues, their stories played out on a larger stage to \na national audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering her movie star parents and access to the White House, \nMaureen harbored no illusions they were like other families. \"What's \nnormal for me,\" she told an audience in 1981, \"isn't the same as \nwhat's normal for you.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily secrets\u0014\nAs the children fought to establish their own identities, family \nsecrets spilled into the public spotlight.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 1988 autobiography, Michael disclosed that he had been \nsexually abused in 1953 by a camp counselor he had regarded as a \nfather figure. He informed his father just before the book was \npublished. \"Dad went pale and put his arm around me,\" he said later.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was grown, Michael floundered as he sought work in acting, \nspeedboat racing and sales. In 1981, Michael used his father's name \nin a letter soliciting potential customers from an Air Force \ncontractor for his airplane parts company. Reagan told him, \"Don't \nwrite any more letters like that.\" Later, Michael resigned his \nposition.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael was also accused and cleared of kleptomania as well as stock \nfraud.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1983, Michael criticized Nancy Reagan to magazine and television \nreporters for spending more time with her foster grandparent program \nthan with his children. He said he had not been invited to the White \nHouse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following year, after Michael declined to attend Patti's wedding, \nthen missed a family Thanksgiving, Nancy Reagan told a syndicated \ncolumnist that he was \"estranged\" from the family. In response, \nMichael issued a news release and held a news conference saying he \nwas \"shocked and hurt.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaureen then accused Michael of having a \"vendetta\" against Nancy and \nsaid he had also ridiculed their brother Ron when he was a ballet \ndancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a conciliatory family meeting one New Year's, Nancy Reagan \nissued a statement through the White House press office: 'Everybody \nloves each other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   In recent years, Michael has found an audience as a Southern \nCalifornia talk show host, though trouble has continued to shadow his \nfamily. His son Cameron spent six months in jail for receiving stolen \nproperty in 1998. At the time, he was living on the streets after his \nparents kicked him out when he failed to hold down a job.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Maureen's book disclosed that she had been brutally beaten by her \nfirst husband, a policeman, a situation she had not confided to her \nfather. Married three times, she also tried several acting and \nbusiness jobs before entering politics herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost election\u0014\n\u0014\n  In 1982, she lost her bid for a U.S. Senate seat in California's \nRepublican primary; during the race, then-President Reagan, asked \nwhether his daughter was really going to run, told journalists, 'I \nhope not.\" He later said he was joking.\u0014\n\u0014\n  His brother Neil, however, accused Maureen of riding on her \nfather's coattails and publicly backed another candidate. During her \ncampaign, Maureen took stands contrary to her father's on abortion, \ngun control and the Equal Rights Amendment.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Later, she served as the U.S. representative to the U.N. Commission \non the Status of Women and in 1987 was appointed by her father to be \nco-chairman of the Republican National Committee.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The 1992 memoir of the most rebellious Reagan offspring, Patti, was \nthe most scandalous. In \"The Way I See It,\" she described her mother \nas abusive and a regular consumer of prescription tranquilizers and \nher father as emotionally detached.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Patti came of age in the 1970s as cultural upheaval was dividing \nfamilies across the country. At 13, she was sent to boarding school. \nLater, addicted to diet pills, she dropped out of the University of  \nSouthern California, experimented with drugs, struggled financially \nand sold marijuana to pay for therapy. She lived with her boyfriends \nand openly disagreed with her father's opinions on abortion rights \nand the Vietnam War. She made public appearances opposing nuclear \npower, which her father supported.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In the 1980s, Patti wrote the first of several unflattering books \nabout her parents, \"Home Front,\" a thinly veiled novel about a \ndistant father who becomes president.\u0014\n\u0014\n  She has dabbled in songwriting, singing, acting and writmg.\u0014\n \u0014\n  Her brother Ron is said to have served as a family comniunicator \nfor many years. Known for youthful high jinks that caused him to be \nexpelled from private school, he later dropped out of Yale to become \na dancer with the Joffrey Ballet. Concerned about insinuations that \nRon might be gay, Reagan told reporters, 'He's all man; we made sure \nof that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  Before being diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Reagan tried to help mend \nfences. After Patti moved\u0014\nabruptly to New York in 1993, he called and wrote her, telling her he \nloved her and asking that she remember her mother's birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The family appeared to become closer as Reagan slipped away. In \n1995, Patti wrote \"Angels Don't Die,\" a tribute to her father's \nreligious faith. In 1996 she and her mother were calling each other \nevery week.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In 1999 Michael also wrote a tribute, 'The Common Sense of an \nUncommon Man: The Wit, Wisdom and Eternal Optimism of Ronald Reagan.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   And Maureen, who had been diagnosed with melanoma in 1996, worked \nhard during her final years of life to raise awareness of the disease \nher father was battling, including serving on the board of the \nChicago-based Alzheimer's Association.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Patti and Ron were at the family home in Bel-Air, on the west side \nof Los Angeles, with their mother when Reagan died Saturday, a family \nspokeswoman said. Michael, who had been there all day Friday, arrived \na short while later.\u0014",

    "words": "Religious \nViolence Perverts Good Motives\u0014\n\u0014\nJack Brymer  07-27-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe increasing violence in the name of religion staggers the \nimagination. In fact, one wonders if religion does not provoke more \nstrife than it prevents. Yet, it is nothing new. A cursory review of \nhistory would certainly support such a conclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome suggest, for example, that Islam has one of the bloodiest \nrecords of the worlds great religions. And yet, its holy prophet and \nfounder Muhammad dreamed of a universal religion based on the noblest \nof ethics. He taught that conversion by the sword was not conversion \nat all. Two years before his untimely death in 632, however, Muhammad \ndispatched an expedition against Syria, which was the beginning of a \ncrusade that continued for nearly 100 years. By the time they were \ndefeated at the Battle of Tours in 732, Islam had carved out the \nlargest religious empire the world had ever seen, primarily at the \npoint of the sword. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the use of violence by religious forces is not limited to \nMuslims. The Christian crusades of the Middle Ages employed violent \nmeasures to regain access to holy sites in Israel and Palestine from \nthe Muslims, including the Childrens Crusade in 1212 which mobilized \n50,000 French and German children to go to Jerusalem. None of them \nreached the Holy City and thousands died en route, while Christian \nmerchants sold other thousands into slavery in North Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, religious bodies have not always directed their \nviolence toward the forces of ungodliness and evil. Much of it has \nbeen directed against the faithful.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo record of religious violence and persecution would be complete \nwithout a mention of the Inquisition. The Roman Church, as it was \ncommonly called in the Middle Ages, claimed power over all its \nsubjects with sanction of punishment, including death, over the \ndisobedient. \u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther--whose insistence on salvation by grace not only rocked \nthe power and corruption of the Roman Church but also ushered in an \nera of unparalleled social advance--was not above suggesting violence \nas a means to oppose those who disagreed with him. \u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking of Roman Catholic bishops and cardinals of the day, Luther \nsuggested that they deserved an uprising that would sweep them from \nthe face of the earth. Then he added, and we would smile to see it \nhappen. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis same Luther proposed burning synagogues, destroying the homes of \nJews and forbidding their rabbis under the threat of death to \ncontinue teaching. Little wonder that following Luthers death, \nEurope was wracked by 100 years of religious wars. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf the current and two previous wars involving Iraq, Iran and Kuwait \nduring the past decade, an Iranian commander describes them as a war \nof faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the violence in the Middle East is traceable toward the \nfaithful. For example, a strip of land known as the West Bank of the \nJordan River has produced five major wars because Jews claim the \nBible gives them title to this land. \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the violence in India is the result of religious fanaticism \nbetween Hindus and Muslims. Likewise, the people of Sri Lanka have \nsuffered a thousand years of ethnic-religious infighting, primarily \nbetween Hindus and Buddhists.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough economic discrimination and civil rights are involved, \nreligion is seen as an underlying major factor in the violence in \nNorthern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn America, Christians in general and Baptists in particular must \nnever forget that the attempt to justify the use of violence for \nreligious purposes is ever present. In our earlier history, a New \nEngland Calvinist recommended the capture of William Penn and his \nQuaker followers so that they might be sold into slavery before their \nheresy could be spread to the New World. \u0014\n\u0014\nMormons, being driven out of Missouri, were attacked in the massacre \nat Hauns Mill, where 20 defenseless members died. After settling in \nNauvoo, Ill., leader Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were jailed. \nA mob broke in and shot both men to death. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore recently, a Nebraska Baptist pastor asked, in the authoritative \nname of Jesus, that God convert, restrain, remove or kill certain \ngovernmental officials opposed to his Christian school. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians, as well as devotees of Islam and other major \nreligions of the world, would have nothing to do with overt acts of \nviolence in the name of religion. But far too many wreak emotional \ndestruction through character assassination, innuendo and half-truth. \nWhile such techniques are not as outwardly violent as suicide \nbombings or assassinations, they still fragment fellowship, erode \nfaith and confidence among believers, and cause the world to doubt \nand reject the church and it teachings. \u0014\n\u0014\nViolence has left an ugly stain on the pages of religious history. Oh \nthat it would serve as a sobering reminder that even the best motives \ncan be perverted with destructive results. \u0014\n\u0014\nJack Brymer of Birmingham, Ala., recently retired from Samford \nUniversity after a 30-year career as a Baptist journalist. This \ncolumn appeared previously in the Anniston Star.\u0014",

    "words": "\"The black velvet backdrop behind his cheerfulness explains a second \nsalient trait of Reagan's: his coldness. Yes, he had a funny story \nfor everyone, including Tip O'Neill and Mikhail Gorbachev, and he \nlaughed at other people's funny stories, not just his own. But behind \nthe bonhomie, there was nothing accessible. \"Even as a teenager,\" \nwrote Edmund Morris, \"he had taken no personal interest in people. \nThey were, and remained, a faceless audience to his perpetual \nperformance.\" Certainly Morris felt faceless in Reagan's presence, \nwhich seems to have driven the biogto distraction. But he was not the \nonly one. People who worked with Reagan closely for years felt they \nnever penetrated. According to his speechwriter Peggy Noonan, White \nHouse staffers made jokes of his elusiveness: \"Who that masked man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReagan's coldness allowed him to be stubborn. He used all the \nresources of public relations, from marks on the floor to \ntheme-of-the-day spin control to movie-star looks, to make his case. \nBut after he had done all that he could do, he did not care what \npeople thought of him. He had his message; when he became President, \nhe had his programs; that was that. He often settled for less than he \nwanted, hut he never stopped wanting it. His stubbornness helped him \nreach the White House despite one of the more discouraging \npre-victory political records. Some politicians have won second \ncontests after previously losing runs for the Presidency: Andrew \nJackson, Richard Nixon. Some have won, after one failed attempt to \nsecure their party's nomination: James Monroe, George H. W. Bush. \nReagan failed twice to get the Republican nominationin 1968 and \n1976before lightning struck. Repeat losers, from Henry Clay to Bob \nDole, usually go on losing. Only Reagan broke the pattern.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n--From  \"AMERICAN HERITAGE,\" 9/04, p. 36\u0014",

When \nthe U.S. population shifted from rural to urban areas in 1920, there \nwas no annunciatory thunderclap. And in about 2060, the year by which \ncensus figures suggest that non-Hispanic whites will become less than \n50% of the population, the switch will have long been old news. \nStill, such dates have historical cachet, and 2004 soon may too. The \nUniversity of Chicago's respected National Opinion Research Center \n(NORC) has reported that the proportion of adult Americans calling \nthemselves Protestants, a steady 63% for decades, fell suddenly to \n52% from 1993 to 2002. Not only that, the study's authors projected \nthat \"perhaps as early as this year the country will for the first \ntime no longer have a Protestant majority.\" The heads-up provoked \nsome spirited discussion about how important the eclipse might be, to \nwhom, and why. Here are the key questions:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--IS EVERYTHING SUDDENLY DIFFERENT? Hardly. As Boston College \npolitical scientist Alan Wolfe notes, \"Even if Protestants dip below \n50%, they're still twice as large as any other group. They're always \ngoing to be the largest group, ever, of anybody.\" But looking at the \npast, he admits this is a \"big deal. John Jay wrote in the Federalist \npapers that we were united by a common religion. But based on this \nsurvey, you can't say that these days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--ARE WE LOSING PROTESTANTS OR SIMPLY FLOODED WITH NON-PROTESTANT \nIMMIGRANTS? The latter has been suggested, disapprovingly, by Harvard \npolitical scientist Samuel Huntington. But NORC STUDY CO-AUTHOR TOM \nW. SMITH SAYS, \"immigration is a factor, but it's not the major \nthing.\" More important are a falling away of adult believers and a \ndeclining number of Protestant children who keep the faith. The \nCatholic proportion of the population has held steady at 23%. Neither \nJews nor Muslims top 4%. The category that has really jumped (from 8% \nto 14%) in the past decade is people who say they don't subscribe to \nany religious identification. Most of this group aren't Atheists, say \nscholars like Claude Fischer at the University of California, \nBerkeley. They still believe in basics like God, heaven and the bible \nas an inspired text, but prefer to think of themselves as spiritual \nrather than anything more specific.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--WHO IS MOST AFFECTED BY THE PROTESTANT SWOON? Primarily the more \nliberal mainline denominations like United Methodists, the \nPresbyterian Church (USA) and the Episcopal Church. \"We are losing \nour own children,\" says Kenneth Carder, Bishop of the Methodists' \nMississippi Conference. But even some evangelical growth is tapering: \nthe 16.3 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has conceded a \ndrop-off in Sunday school enrollment.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--WHY IS MAINLINE PROTESTANTISM SHRINKING? Three explanations, \nproposed over decades, may each have some validity: Mainline churches \ndid not require enough commitment, theologically or evangelistically, \nfrom congregants, whose enthusiasm waned accordingly; denominations \nthat started out aggressively courting members turned to other tasks, \nsuch as social activism; and mainline birthrates lag behind the \nnational average. Most mainline leaders claim their plight may hold \nhidden opportunities. The Rev. Dr. Bob Edgar, a methodist minister \nand general secretary of the National Council of Churches USA (whose \nmembership historically has had a strong Protestant presence), notes, \n\"the [Hebrew] prophets never had a majority, and yet they had \nimportant things to say. Maybe this is a positive wake-up call for us \nto worry less about numbers and more about faithfulness and \nrelevancy. It's moral authority, not a function of size.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough plausible, why does this sound a bit like rationalization? \nBecause for centuries Protestantism's huge numbers had significant \nconsequences: it bred most of America's founders and elite, and \nserved as a template for its civil institutions and cultural \nassumptions. Huntington, a cheerleader, has credited it with our \n\"core culture\" of \"individualism, the work ethic, and moralism.\" \nProtestant tropes of human perfectibility and the city on the hill \ncontinue to echo through political rhetoric. Comments Christian \nSmith, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill: \"the mainline always thought, we are America. What's The Big \nDeal?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--IF THAT'S THE CASE, SHOULD EVEN NON-PROTESTANTS MOURN ITS DECLINE? \nNot necessarily. By now, Protestantism's main nontheological message \nof radical individualism (or, as Berkeley sociologist Robert Bellah \nskeptically lampoons it, \"You can be anything you want to be ... and \nif you don't make it, you have no one to blame but yourself\") is \ndeeply encoded in our national self-understanding  and even upon \nother religions, once they have spent a few generations here. \n\"Catholics for choice?\" Snorts John Fonte, a senior fellow at the \nHudson Institute. \"That's Protestantism.\" Not quite, but it is proof \nthat whatever its institutional trend, Protestantism's influence will \nlive on.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWith reporting by Broward Liston/Orlando\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Time Inc.

These subjects \nare at the heart of many pressing issues facing society. That which \nfor centuries has been considered to be basic Christian morality in \nthe marriage setting is now increasingly called into question, not \nonly in secular society but also within Christian churches themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe institutions of family and marriage are under attack and facing \ngrowing centrifugal forces that are tearing them apart. An increasing \nnumber of nations are now debating the topic of same-sex unions, thus \nmaking it a world issue. The public discussion has engendered strong \nemotions. In light of these developments the Seventh-day Adventist \nChurch is clearly restating its position.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe reaffirm, without hesitation, our long-standing position. As \nexpressed in the church's Fundamental Beliefs statement, \"Marriage \nwas divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a \nlifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship.\"' \nThough \"sin has perverted God's ideals for marriage and family7 \"the \nfamily tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred of any human \nrelationship7 and thus \"families need to experience renewal and \nreformation in their relationships\" (An Affirmation of Family, \n1990).2 God instituted \"marriage, a covenant-based union of two \ngenders physically, emotionally, and spiritually, spoken of in \nScripture as 'one flesh.\"' \"The monogamous union in marriage of a man \nand a woman is . . . the only morally appropriate locus of genital or \nrelated intimate sexual expression.\" \"Any lowering of this high view \nis to that extent a lowering of the heavenly ideal\" (An Affirmation \nof Marriage, 1996)2\u0014\n\u0014\nHomosexuality is a manifestation of the disorder and brokenness in \nhuman inclinations and relations caused by sin coming into the world. \nWhile everyone is subject to fallen human nature, \"we also believe \nthat by God's grace and through the encouragement of the community of \nfaith, an individual may live in harmony with the principles of God's \nWord\" (Seventh-day Adventist Position Statement on Homosexuality, \n1999).~\u0014\n\u0014\nWe hold that all people, no matter what their sexual orientation, are \nchildren of God. We do not condone singling out any group for scorn \nand derision, let alone abuse. However, it is very clear that God's \nWord does not countenance a homosexual lifestyle; neither has the \nChristian church throughout her 2,000-year history. Seventh-day \nAdventists believe that the biblical teaching is still valid today, \nbecause it is anchored in the very nature of humanity and God's plan \nat Creation for marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nA church-approved statement of January 21, 2004.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Marriage and the Family\" Seventh-day Adventists BelieveA Biblical \nExposition of 27 Fundamental Doctrines.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublic statement, An Affirmation of Family, released July 5, 1990, at \nthe General Conference session, Indianapolis, Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nStatement voted by the General Conference Administrative Committee on \nApril 23, 1996.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Statement voted by the Annual Council of the General Conference \nExecutive Committee on October 3, 1999.\u0014",

    "title": "RABBI PAUL - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Saint Paul, writes Bruce Chilton in this fascinating and revealing \nwork, is the most complex, brilliant, troubled figure in the New \nTestament. His widely studied (and criticized) letters, written to \nthe fledgling churches scattered throughout the Roman world, spoke \ndirectly and eloquently on matters of faith, conscience, and \nsexuality, and in the process articulated the beliefs that now \nconstitute the heart of Christianity. Through his interpretations of \nJesus life and teachings, Paul helped transform a grassroots \nmovement into the highly organized religion we know today. The \nChurchs first fathers considered him their premier theologian; to \nthis day he is widely credited for separating Christianity from \nJudaism by teaching that God requires man only to love and believe, \nnot obey. Without Paul, in other words, there would likely be no \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA remarkable portrait of the Churchs intellectual architect\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this brilliant new study, Bruce Chilton, professor of religion at \nBard College and author of the critically acclaimed biography Rabbi \nJesus, places Saint Pauls life and thought in the context of his \ntimes, illuminating both the historical figure and his pivotal role \nas a founding architect of the Church, while exploring Pauls unique \nmind and experience in light of the Greco-Roman and Jewish traditions \nfrom which he drew.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking to understand the thinker who has given us so much of what \nis most beautiful and most troublesome in Christian faith, Chilton \ntraces Pauls evolving historical reputation among theologians and \nlay critics, from his early position as the Churchs foremost thinker \nto more modern views that criticize him for being sexist and \nhomophobic.\u0014\n\u0014\nArtfully written and based on first-rate scholarship, including \ninsightful readings of Pauls letters as well as extensive use of \nboth contemporary sources and the latest historical research, Rabbi \nPaul is a brilliant and rewarding look at the early days of \nChristianity. 336 pp\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u0014\nBruce Chilton is the Bernard Iddlings Bell Professor of Religion at \nBard College in Annadale-on-Hudson and priest at the Free Church of \nSaint John in Barrytown, New York.

They had been interviewed and carefully scrutinized. Now \nat last \u0014\ntheir dreams were to be fulfilled. But their day of happiness was \nanother's \u0014\npain. \u0014\n\u0014\nArriving at the offices of the Society they were led up a flight of \nstairs \u0014\nto a waiting room. After a few minutes they heard someone else \nclimbing the stairs. It was the young student mother whose baby was \nto be adopted. She was met by the lady responsible for the adoption \narrangements and taken into another room. Our friends heard a muffled \nconversation and a few minutes later footsteps on the stairs as the \nyoung mother left. They heard her convulsive sobbing until the front \ndoor of the office was closed. Then, \u0014\nthere was silence. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lady in charge then conducted them next door. In a little crib \nwas a six \u0014\nweek old baby boy. On a chair beside it was a brown paper bag \ncontaining a change of clothes and two letters. One of these, \naddressed to the new \u0014\nparents, thanked them for providing a home for her baby and \nacknowledged \u0014\nthat under the terms of the adoption each would never know the \nother's \u0014\nidentity. Then the young mother added one request. Would they allow \nher \u0014\nlittle son to read the other letter on his eighteenth birthday? She \nassured \u0014\nthem that she had not included any information about her identity. \nThe \u0014\ncouple entrusted that letter to a lawyer and one day the young man \nwill read \u0014\nthe message which his mother wrote on the day when with breaking \nheart, she parted with him. \u0014\n\u0014\nI wonder what she wrote? If I had to condense all I feel about life \nand love \u0014\ninto a few precious words what would I say? I would have no time for \ntrivia. \u0014\nI would not be concerned about economics, politics, the weather, the \nsize of \u0014\nhouse or the type of car.

    "words": "Rabble Roused\u0014\nThe complainers place me in an awkward position, seeking God on their \nbehalf when I'd rather give them the boot.\u0014\nBy M. Craig Barnes\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Hebrews left Egypt to begin their difficult journey through \nthe desert to the Promised Land, they brought \"the rabble\" with them. \nThese were not true believers in this journey or in the God who \ncalled them to it. The rabble's toleration for discomfort was low and \ntheir capacity for complaint was high, always an unfortunate \ncombination.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the pastors I know would love to get rid of the rabble in their \nchurch. The dopey thing is that the rabble keep threatening to leave \nif we don't service their needs. \"If you don't get a better youth \npastor in here, we'll just go to another church.\" Why do they think \nthat's threatening? \"So go,\" I want to say. But the rabble never \nleave.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a holy purpose for the rabble. Their complaining places the \npastor in the awkward position of standing between the people and the \nGod they cannot see. The grace of that awkwardness is that it forces \nthe pastor to pray, looking for the One who is present but not \napparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough most of the wilderness journey, Moses was a model of patient \nleadership. When the people complained about their thirst, he found \nwater. When they complained about the lack of food, he pointed to \nmanna. When they complained that he was gone too long on Sinai and \nturned to the idol of a golden calf, Moses interceded and talked God \nout of consuming them.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater the people complained about their \"misfortunes.\" This time God \ntorched a few of them and would have burned up the whole camp if \nMoses hadn't interceded again. Immediately afterward the rabble got \neveryone complaining about how sick and tired they were of manna. \nThey wanted meat!\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was then that Moses finally snapped: \"Why have you treated your \nservant so badly, that you lay the burden of this people on me? Am I \ntheir mother? Where am I supposed to find meat for all these people? \nI am not able to carry this people. If you care about me at all, just \nkill me and get it over with\" (Num. 11:11-15).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the repetition of the complaining that tempts the leader to \nburnout.\u0014\n\u0014\nWant to know my most vivid memory from the last 23 years of pastoral \nministry? Dj vu.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've had the exact same conversations in three different churches: \nthe youth group eating pizza in the church parlor, no one fills the \nchurch van with gas, the struggle to find Sunday school teachers, and \nthe question about special offerings hurting the general budget. Even \nin pastoral counseling the same conversations just keep happening. \nAfter the fiftieth time hearing how mean someone's parents were, I \nwant to say, \"Why are you stuck here? Why am I stuck here?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you're in leadership it is tempting to think your job is to get \nthe people to the Promised Land. But that's actually God's job. Your \njob is to bear their burdens while they're in the wilderness. We \nprefer just the opposite. Let God love the people and we'll just move \nthem along.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut pastors are called to serve as wilderness guides, wandering \nthrough the ordinary with their people, loving them enough to point \nto the manna that keeps them spiritually alive even when it is \nunappreciated. We have to choose to keep embracing this high calling.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most dangerous rabble are not the complaining people around us, \nbut the rabble that live within the leader's heart. This is why I \nhave never understood the advice that says, \"Just trust your heart.\" \nIf your heart is like mine, most days there's a bad committee meeting \ngoing on in there. So you have to make choices about which inner \nvoice you're going to honor, or the rabble of anxiety will overwhelm \nyou.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's the scary part: God will honor your choices. As Moses \neventually discovered, if you get fed up with wandering around and \nkeep asking God to get these people to the Promised Land without you, \nyou'll get your wish. Moses wasn't with them when they finally \ncrossed the Jordan. And it didn't make him as happy as he thought it \nwould.\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor at large Craig Barnes is pastor of Shadyside Presbyterian \nChurch and professor of leadership and ministry at Pittsburgh \nTheological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Leadership Journal.\u0014\nFall 2004, Vol. XXV, No. 4, Page 114\u0014",

    "title": "RECOVERING A PROTESTANT MARY",
    "words": "Recovering a Protestant Mary\u0014\nA conversation with Timothy George\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy George is dean of Beeson Divinity School, an \ninterdenominational, evangelical theological school within a Baptist \nuniversity (Samford University, Birmingham, Alabama), and an \nexecutive editor of Christianity Today. He is author of the article \n\"The Blessed Evangelical Mary\" in the December 2003 issue of \nChristianity Today, which is a short version of a chapter from Mary: \nMother of God, edited by Carl E. Braaten (Eerdmans, 2004).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn your article, you suggest that Protestant believers have cut \nthemselves off too hastily from Mary, a biblical figure who was at \nthe forefront of the church's imagination from the post-apostolic \nperiod through the Reformation and beyond. Could you say a little \nabout this?\u0014\n\u0014\nI take my bearings from the Reformers. On the one hand, they were \nvery critical of what they considered Marian excesses, and they \ntalked at length about some of the ways in which Mary was given too \nmuch veneration, too much almost idolatrous worship, substituting her \nfor Christ himself in some ways at the popular devotional level. On \nthe other hand, they themselves had a very explicit devotion to Mary, \nespecially Luther but also Zwingli and Calvin in their own way. They \nwanted to give honor to Mary. They wanted to remind the church that \nshe was to be called blessed in every generation. They honored her as \nthe vehicle of God's grace in giving Jesus to the world and an \nexample of justification by faith alone, because she believed so \npurely in the gospel. I think we need to go back and reclaim \nsomething of the Reformers' more positive view of Mary, insofar as it \nreally is biblical. It really is a part of our own Protestant \nheritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did Martin Luther's regard for Mary manifest itself in particular \nbeliefs or practices?\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther continued to celebrate three of the great Marian \nfestivals-Purification, Annunciation, and Visitation. He also \ncontinued to use the Ave Maria prayer; that is, the first part of it: \n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, blessed are you among women, and blessed \nis the fruit of thy womb.\" The latter part, \"Pray for us sinners in \nthe hour of our death,\" actually came later, added by the Carthusians \nafter the Reformation. All the Reformers, even the relatively radical \nZwingli, continued to say the first part of the Ave Maria. Of course, \nthey did not say it as a prayer to Mary-they made that very clear-but \nas an acknowledgement of the fact that God's grace was so manifest in \nthe virginal conception and her giving birth to Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, Mary is prominent in some of the hymns that come from the \nLutheran Reformation. And if you take it to the next century, \nobviously this continued with, for example, Bach's Magnificat and so \nforth surrounding both the Advent of Christ and also Mary at the \ncross. So in worship, in liturgy, in theology, despite the Reformers' \ncritique, Mary continued to have a prominent place for early \nProtestants-I think an appropriately prominent place.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes there would also be religious plays. This is the one part \nof the Marian devotion that we still practice, in a way, with the \nChristmas pageant. That is really a remnant of medieval Marian \ndevotion: it enters the Christian tradition with St. Francis's \ndevotion to the crche (pp. 22, 24). So today, even we good \nold-fashioned Southern Baptists always have a Christmas pageant: one \nof the young ladies dresses up like Mary; sometimes she carries a \nlive baby. This is a good thing, to keep this part of the tradition. \nBut sometimes that's the only acknowledgement that we have, and even \nthat is often done without serious reflection on the meaning of the \nIncarnation, which is what Advent and Christmas are all about.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the Christmas pageant is not enough, how else can Protestants \nre-connect, without buying into some of the non-canonical doctrines?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think a good place to start-perhaps the best place for today's \nChristians-is with Mary under the cross. Many people over the past \nyear have started here, as they have viewed Mel Gibson's powerful \nmovie, The Passion of the Christ. Here we see the events of the \npassion through the mater dolorosa, the weeping Mary, witnessing her \nson's death, cradling his corpse. This Mary stands in solidarity with \nall believers who also live under the shadow of the Cross, including \nmany whose lives are at risk today because of their witness for \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Mary was the one disciple of Jesus who didn't flee when all the \nother disciples fled, but who stayed and accepted the burden of being \nunder the cross to the very end. When we suffer or are persecuted, we \ncan look to this Mary who remained faithful and obedient even in that \ngrim moment. That's the Mary that you see in the famous Gruenewald \npainting, for example (p. 37).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mary at the cross is important even for those of us not under \npersecution. Wendell Berry puts it well in his poem \"The Way of \nPain\": \"Unless we grieve like Mary / at His grave, giving Him up / as \nlost, no Easter morning comes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this a sense in which the traditional view of Mary as a forerunner \nand symbol of the whole church is on the right track?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, Eastern iconographers have it right: they never depict Mary \nalone, but always with Christ, the apostles, and the saints. The New \nTestament portrays her as bridging the Old and New Testaments at \nJesus' birth, and then at the end of Jesus' life, Mary is both among \nthe last at the cross, and among the first in the Upper Room, for the \nbirth of the church at Pentecost.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it has not been just the Eastern Orthodox or the early and \nmedieval fathers who have seen Mary as a representative par \nexcellence of the church. The Reformers noticed that when all of the \ndisciples had fled in fear, Mary remained true to Christ and his \nword. Her fidelity unto the Cross showed that the true faith could be \npreserved in one individual. And the Reformers honored her for this, \nconsidering her the mother of the (true remnant) church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat other traditional moments or characterizations of Mary can be \nhelpful for us today as Protestants?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two statements that Mary makes in the Gospels, both of \nwhich I think are absolutely exemplary for the Christian life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is this: \"Let it be unto me according to your Word.\" This \nact of surrender, submission, standing in awe before the presence of \nthe Holy, is the very posture of humility and surrender all of us are \ncalled to take before God. And Mary's words anticipate Jesus' \nstatement in the garden, \"Not my will but yours be done.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMary's second exemplary saying comes at the wedding at Cana. First \nJesus has this little, almost, tussle with his mother, saying, \n\"Woman, my hour has not yet come\"-which sounds a little bit gruff, \nJesus speaking to his mama like that. But then she says to the wine \nstewards, \"Whatever he says unto you, do it.\" Well, again, this is \nthe call to, as evangelical Protestants sing, \"trust and obey.\" So \nfrom the lips of Mary you've got probably the two most salient words \nof counsel for living the Christian life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is, especially among Roman Catholics, a continued \nfascination and popular devotion focused on Mary-prayers to her, \napparitions, miracles, and so forth. What's the root of that?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think much of this falls under the heading of \"folk\" Catholicism \nrather than \"official\" Catholicism. Because when you talk to Catholic \ntheologians often they're, if not embarrassed, a bit reticent to \nendorse this. The church itself is very careful not to weigh in on \nthe authenticity of all these apparitions. It will say, \"It is \npossible Mary may be coming here. Go in faith.\" But the church \ndoesn't give its approval to all these stories of apparitions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis cautious attitude stems from Vatican II. At that watershed \ncouncil in the 1960s, there was a debate over whether Mary should be \ngiven a separate chapter on her own in the documents coming out of \nthe council. And it was decided that Mary would be treated in the \ncontext of Lumen Gentium, the council's statement on the doctrine of \nthe church. Mariology, in other words, was treated as a part of \necclesiology, rather than being given prominence in a separate \ndoctrinal document. And so I think this reticence about Marian \napparitions and miracles stems from this effort to be faithful to the \nspirit of Vatican II, over against the swelling, surging devotion to \nMary that sometimes overwhelms this reticence at places like Lourdes \nand Fatima.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Mary is simply a historical figure, dead and gone, why should she \nbe considered part of believers' prayer lives?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, I believe that the Virgin Mary is alive and aware in heaven. I \ndon't pray to Mary, but it's not inconceivable to me that Mary knows \nwhat's going on-as all the saints and blessed departed may. It's \nquite possible that they could all be praying for us. But the Bible \ndoesn't say.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomebody once wrote a letter to me and wondered why evangelicals \ndidn't pray to Mary. And my response is we need all the prayers we \ncan get: Mary, the saints, everybody. But we don't have any biblical \nwarrant for asking for them. And we already have direct access to \nJesus. If Mary and the saints want to pray for us in heaven as our \nfriends do here on earth, then wonderful. But there's no biblical \nwarrant for us incorporating this into Christian piety.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut can we learn from that passage in Hebrews 12 about the \"cloud of \nwitnesses\" that, first, we are being \"watched\" and, second, Mary and \nothers who have gone on before may be appropriate examples in the \nfaith?\u0014\n\u0014\nAbsolutely in both cases. Yes. Where our tendency may simply be to \nfocus on the flesh-and-blood saints around us, there may be reasons \nto meditate and be aware of those who have gone before. And Mary is, \nI think, to be included among the saints in heaven who we should \nremember and honor and learn from.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

LeTourneau. \u0014\n\u0014\n     A big man with a big heart for God, LeTourneau had always done \nthings in a big way. His company designed and built some of the \nworld's most massive machineryearth movers, transporters, missile \nlaunchers, bridge builders and portable offshore drilling rigs. If a \ntask needed to be done faster, smarter, and bigger, LeTourneau could \nusually be found on the job. \u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Remember that there are no big jobs,\" he said, describing his \nflair for colossal endeavors, \"only small machines and small \nthinking.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     His capacity to think and act on a grand scale made LeTourneau \nan internationally recognized industrialist. Yet he always attributed \nhis success to the Lord. He typically began his talks to students and \nbusinessmen by saying: \"I'm just a mechanic that God has blessed, and \nit seems He wants me to go around telling how He will bless you too.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     LeTourneau's success came at the price of many early failures \nand setbacks. It was these humbling years that formed the backdrop to \nhis salvation and \"partnership with God\" in business. \u0014\n\u0014\n     LeTourneau dropped out of school at age fourteen and went to \nwork shoveling sand and dirt at an iron works factory in Portland, \nOregon. Even at this early age, his mind was busy thinking of how to \ndo the job more efficiently. By sixteen, he had grown into a large, \nmuscular young man. And though these two years of labor with \nstreet-savvy men had educated him in the ways of the world, they had \nhardened his heart to the things of God. What he didn't know was that \nhis devoutly Christian parents had been praying for his salvation \ndaily. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The week before Christmas in 1904, the city of Portland had a \ncrusade, and LeTourneau decided to attend. \"What terrified me was \nthat after a week of concentrated singing, and listening to sermons, \nI didn't feel even a tremor of response.\" That concern led to a \nhumble plea for God's help. \"No bolts of lightning hit me. No great \nflash of awareness. I just prayed to the Lord to save me, and then I \nwas aware of another presence.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     The following years were turbulent. LeTourneau moved to \nCalifornia where he worked almost forty odd jobs. At twenty-eight, he \nmarried a girl twelve years younger. They lost their first child in \ninfancy, and he broke his neck in a stock car crash. Due to an inept \npartner in a Stockton, California, repair shop, he was $5,000 in debt \nby age thirty-one. Disengaging himself from the garage, he promised \nto repay his indebtedness to a trusting banker. When the banker asked \nhow he would repay, he simply held up his two hands. Impressed by his \ndetermination and honesty, the banker agreed to extend the loan, so \nLeTourneau bought a tractor and scraper and went into the \nearth-moving business. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Stubborn, willful, and self-reliant by nature, LeTourneau \nrefused to give up. His struggle to make his faith in Christ relevant \nto his life and work led him to attend a revival at his church. It \nwas there he prayed: \"Lord, if You'll forgive and help me, I'll do \nanything You want me to do from this day on.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     Feeling renewed, LeTourneau wondered how God would use him. He \nvisited the preacher early the next morning, and the pastor told him: \n\"You know, Brother LeTourneau, God needs businessmen as well as \npreachers and missionaries.\" That was all LeTourneau needed to hear. \u0014\n\u0014\n     In the book, More Than Conquerors, a collection of biographical \nsketches of Christian men and women in history, it is noted of \nLeTourneau: \"In our high-tech age today, machines - really big \nmachines that push and pull, lift and move, scrape and digare not \ntoo popular anymore. However, without the kinds of machines that R. \nG. LeTourneau dreamed of . . . the technological age we are now in \nmight never have happened at all.\" Yet as significant as his \ncontribution to industry was, his commitment to \"do whatever God \nwanted him to do\" left a legacy of trusting faith, godly generosity, \nand compassion. \u0014\n\u0014\n     For many years, he lived on ten percent of his income and gave \naway ninety percent to Christian work, especially missionary efforts \nin Africa and South America. Even when his business was in financial \njeopardy, he continued giving his sacrificial pledges to Christ's \nwork. \"The question\" he said, \"is not how much of my money I give to \nGod, but rather how much of God's money I keep for myself.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     Throughout his life, LeTourneau emphasized God's ability to help \nthe common man with everyday problems. He founded a university in \nTexas that bears his name and formed a foundation that funds many \nChristian ministries. Before his death in 1969 at age seventy-nine, \nLeTourneau said: \"Everything considered, I've had my share of ups and \ndowns, but thus far my life has been a miracle of God's grace all the \nway through.\"\u0014",

Kauffman |posted 04/25/05\u0014\n\u0014\nBAPTISM beautifully conveys how Christ has transformed our peril: \nwater is both perilous and life-giving; and Christ has transformed \nthe peril of drowning in sin into the gentle, cleansing bath of \nsalvation.\u0014\nDebra Rienstra, So Much More: An Invitation to Christian Spirituality\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE of baptism is the objective fact to which it \nwitnesses, the historic event of redemption and the present gift that \nit makes possible, embraced through faith in that God who acted and \nyet acts.\u0014\nG.R. Beasley-Murray, Baptism in the New Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nIN THE WATERS of baptism we are reminded that we are not born in a \nvacuum, nor do we journey entirely alone (although loneliness is \noften part of the burden). Being reborn, being made alive, involves \nbeing born into a community. So there are strings attached to this \nadventure.\u0014\nAlan W. Jones, Journey into Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nBAPTISM CONSECRATES us, and consecration is a conscriptive rope that \ntakes us to where we would rather not go, namely, into that suffering \nthat produces maturity.\u0014\nRonald Rolheiser, The Holy Longing\u0014\n\u0014\nBAPTISM CELEBRATES and effects the merging of the Jewish and the \nGentile stories. A people with the law and a people without it, a \npeople walled off from the world and a people open to it, become a \nsingle community, melding the legacies of both. . . . This new status \nis a new kind of social reality, a unity that overarches the \ndifferences (Jew/Gentile, male/female, slave/free) that previously \nhad separated people.\u0014\nJohn Howard Yoder, Body Politics\u0014\n\u0014\nBAPTISM IS VALID, even though faith be wanting. For my faith does not \nmake baptism, but receives it.\u0014\nMartin Luther, The Large Catechism\u0014\n\u0014\nFAITH DOES NOT follow from baptism, but baptism follows from faith.\u0014\nMenno Simons, Foundation of Christian Doctrine\u0014\n\u0014\nWHETHER BAPTIZED as children or adults, our baptism signifies \nprimarily what God has graciously done for us, and it is upon this \nthat faith rests. It can be argued that the two forms of \nbaptisminfant and adulttogether express the full meaning of baptism \nbetter than each would alone. In other words, their meanings are \ncomplementary rather than mutually exclusive.\u0014\nDaniel L. Migliore, Faith Seeking Understanding\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN PEOPLE submit to Christian baptism, they die with the Messiah \nand are raised with him into a new life. This means, first and \nforemost, a change of status.  Once you are baptized, of course, you \ncan try to shirk or shrug off your new responsibilities. You can \npretend you don't after all have a new status.  But what you can't \ndo is get unbaptized again.\u0014\nTom Wright, Paul for Everyone, Romans: Part One\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today. .\u0014\nMay 2005, Vol. 49, No. 5, Page 52\u0014",

    "title": "READING THE LETTERS OF IGNATIUS",
    "words": "A godly teacher encouraged me to start a systematic, chronological \nreading of the Church Fathers, and he suggested that I begin with the \nletters of Ignatius of Antioch. I did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nIgnatius, the second bishop of Antioch, was condemned to death by the \nRoman government in the year 107. On his westward way to martyrdom in \nRome, he found time to write seven rather short letters to various \nlocal churches, encouraging them to hold fast to the Christian faith \nin those trying times.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring those early years of strife in the second century, Ignatius \ninsisted on the orderly structure and organization of the church, \nemphasizing the role and authority of the bishop in the church. These \nletters are full of admonitions regarding obedience to the Larger \nInstitution, exactly the sorts of things I would have expected from a \nbishop.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I was not prepared for, however, was the discovery that Ignatius \nloved Jesus more intimately and intensely than anyone I had ever met \nin my whole life. His constant references to Jesus as Lord and Savior \nwere more poignant and personal than anything I could remember from \nmy earlier experience of being a Christian. As I read his letters, I \nkept finding an incredible ardor of love for and devotion to the \nliving person of Jesus. On nearly every page I found lines like, \"Him \nI seek, who died on our behalf; Him I desire who rose again.\" And, \n\"Arm yourselves with gentleness and be strengthened in faith, which \nis the flesh of our Lord, and in love, which is the blood of Jesus \nChrist.\" And, \"as for me, my charter is Jesus Christ, the inviolable \ncharter is His cross and His death and resurrection, and faith \nthrough Him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHere, obviously, was a true Christian, and lo, he was, of all things, \na bishop! It had never occurred to my young mind that bishops had \nanything more than an \"official\" function. What Ignatius did for me \nwas combine in his own person two things that the experience of my \nchildhood had never really brought together: the personal life of \nintense love for Jesus Christ and the official organization of the \nlarger Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry Reardon is pastor of All Saints Antiochian Orthodox \nChurch in Chicago, Illinois, and a senior editor of Touchstone: A \nJournal of Mere Christianity.\u0014",

Women who have red hair have an innate ability \nto tolerate more pain than other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile testing the painkilling drug pentazocine, researchers from \nMcGill University in Montreal discovered that the same gene that \ngives women red hair and fair skin also plays a role in the body's \nnatural pain suppression system. However, it doesn't work for male \ncarrot-tops. Redheaded women can tolerate more pain than anyone else, \nincluding men with red hair and men and women who do not have red \nhair. The others all had a similar and much lower tolerance to pain \nthan flame-haired females.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"While we believe pain is the same in all women of all hair colors, \nour study shows women with red hair respond better to the painkilling \ndrug we tested than anyone else--including men,\" lead researcher \nJeffrey S. Mogil, a professor of pain studies at McGill, said in a \nnews release.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy would the gene that gives red hair and fair skin--identified as \nMc1r--work differently in redheaded men and women? Mogil told Reuters \nthat men and women are using different pain pathways. \"If they were \nusing the same pathways, then the redhead gene would have the same \nimpact for both sexes,\" he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we experience pain, our bodies attempt to dull the discomfort by \nreleasing natural substances that are similar to medications like \nmorphine. The gene Mc1r influences the pathway through which the body \ndoles out those naturally occurring painkillers in women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe research could affect how doctors prescribe pain medication, \nsince it's clear that genetic differences impact how well a drug will \nwork for individual people. The study findings were published in the \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Cathryn Conro\u0014",

    "words": "Richard Baxter\u0014\nModerate in an Age of Extremes\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I preached  as a dying man to dying men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Baxter never received a higher commission than that of parish \npastor to loom workers in Kidderminster. Still, he was the most \nprominent English churchman of the 1600s. He was a peacemaker who \nsought unity among Protestants, and yet he was a highly independent \nthinkerand at the center of every major controversy in England \nduring his lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonconformist who sought unity\u0014\nBorn in Rowton to parents who undervalued education, Baxter was \nlargely self-taught. He eventually studied at a free school, then at \nroyal court, where he became disgusted at what he saw as frivolity. \nHe left to study divinity, and at age 23, he was ordained into the \nChurch of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the Anglican church, Baxter found common ground with the \nPuritans, a growing faction who opposed the church's episcopacyand \nwas itself breaking into factions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaxter, for his part, did his best to avoid the disputes between \nAnglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and other \ndenominations, even convincing local ministers to cooperate in some \npastoral matters. \"In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, \nliberty; in all things, charity,\" he was fond of saying.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe interest in cooperation was not due to a lack of conviction. On \nthe contrary, Baxter was opinionated in his theology, which was not \nquite Separatist and not quite Conformist. Among his more than 200 \nworks are long, controversial discourses on doctrine. Still, he \nbelieved society was a large family under a loving father, and in his \ntheology, he tried to cut between the extremes. He eventually \nregistered himself as \"a mere Nonconformist\" (\"Nonconformist\" was a \ntechnical term meaning \"not Anglican\"), breaking with the Church of \nEngland mainly because of the lack of power it gave parish clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nPersecuted moderate\u0014\nBaxter also found himself as a peacemaker during the English Civil \nWars. He believed in monarchy, but a limited one. He served as a \nchaplain for the parliamentary army, but then helped to bring about \nthe restoration of the king. Yet as a moderate, Baxter found himself \nthe target of both extremes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was still irritated with the episcopacy in 1660, when he was \noffered the bishopric of Hereford, so he declined it. As a result, he \nwas barred from ecclesiastical office and not permitted to return to \nKidderminster, nor was he allowed to preach. Between 1662 and 1688 \n(when James II was overthrown), he was persecuted and was imprisoned \nfor 18 months, and he was forced to sell two extensive libraries.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, he continued to preach: \"I preached as never sure to preach \nagain,\" he wrote, \"and as a dying man to dying men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBaxter became even better known for his prolific writing. His \ndevotional classic The Saints' Everlasting Rest was one of the most \nwidely read books of the century. When asked what deviations should \nbe permitted from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, he created an \nentirely new one, called Reformed Liturgy, in two weeks. His \nChristian Directory contains over one million words. His \nautobiography and his pastoral guide, The Reformed Pastor, are still \nwidely read today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Gospel dieth not when I die: the church dieth not: the praises \nof God die not: the world dieth not: and perhaps it shall grow \nbetter,\" he wrote near the end of his life. \"It may be that some of \nthe seed that I have sown shall spring up to some benefit of the dark \nunpeaceable world when I am dead.\"\u0014",

It is not from ars moriendi, the art of \ndying, but from the resurrection of Christ that a new and purifying \nwind can blow through our present world.  If a few people really \nbelieved that and acted on it in their daily lives, a great deal \nwould be changed.

    "words": "By SOMINI SENGUPTA\u0014\nPublished: July 24, 2007\u0014\n\u0014\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, July 23  Hameeda Sarfraz, 19, lively eyes \nsparkling out of a black burqa, was describing the boons of the \nafterlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn heaven you get everything without hardship, explained Miss \nSarfraz, daughter of a bus driver. In heaven, if a martyr feels \nhungry, food appears, the best quality food, and you wont even know \nwhere it came from.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiss Sarfraz, an alumna of the now bullet-ridden Jamia Hafsa Islamic \nschool for girls, says she deeply regrets missing her chance to be a \nmartyr. She fled through the back door of the school on July 3, just \nhours after a gun battle began between Pakistani special forces and \nmilitants holed up in the neighboring Red Mosque, the parent \ninstitution of Jamia Hafsa.\u0014\n\u0014\nSentiments like hers are the fruits of a radical Islam that has \nblossomed in this country  not just in the lawless tribal areas that \nAmerican intelligence officials described as an enduring sanctuary \nfor Al Qaeda, but here in its capital, in a mosque-and-school \ncompound that until recently enjoyed the blessings of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe presents a portrait of adolescent passion that one might find \nanywhere, except that she is a Pakistani girl from a poor rural \nfamily, whose members are less devout than she, and her passion is \ndirected against the government of the president, Gen. Pervez \nMusharraf. Some of Jamia Hafsas alumnae say they still wish to die \nin the cause of militant Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the siege, the Pakistani military maintained that women and \nchildren had been held hostage by hard-core fighters inside the \ncompound, but Miss Sarfraz and several others interviewed said they \nwere free to stay or go, and some held out until near the end. The \nbodies of six women were recovered at battles end.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was studying there six years, said Shahnaz Akhtar, 20, another \nformer student who held out until the next-to-last day of the siege. \nI was so attached to it. I couldnt leave just because a dictator \nstarted bombing it. I feel more at home there than I do at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly before the siege began, female students had come out of the \nschool, draped in black burqas, waving bamboo sticks and taunting \ntroops stationed nearby. The Pakistani news media dubbed them chicks \nwith sticks.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiss Sarfraz came home two weeks ago, out of that caldron of radical \nIslamist fervor, Islamabad, back to the prosaic chores of a young \nwoman in the Pakistani countryside. Home is a village perched on \ngreen terraced hills, a little more than 50 miles from the capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nI miss Jamia, she continued. My contact with books is gone. At \nhome the only thing for me to do is take care of my parents. I clean \nthe house. I cook.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe and others came back with a mission to reform their families and \ntheir communities, cajoling their mothers and sisters to hide \nthemselves in black burqas. They say they have lost interest in the \npleasures of this life, though some, like Miss Akhtar, have yet to \ngive up on pleasures like painting their toenails in dark red. They \nexpress an obsession with the afterlife.\u0014",

Gods creative activity was completed in seven days, \nand the\u0014\nseventh day of each week, the Sabbath, was a joyful reminder (Isa \n58:13-14)\u0014\nof Gods own rest in creation (Gen 2:3). The seventh month observed \nfour\u0014\nnational festivals, with two lasting for seven daysPassover and \nBooths.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven days were given to the wedding feast (Judg 14:12, 17) and in \nthe seventh\u0014\nyear the land was given rest (Lev 25:2-7), allowed to lie fallow for \nrejuvenation.\u0014\nThe Festival of Weeks, or Pentecost, was celebrated on the fiftieth \nday, seven complete weeks after Passover; and the fiftieth year was \nthe year of Jubilee. The completion of\u0014\nseven cycles of seven years commanded the release of bondslaves and \nthe return of bought land (Lev 25:8-55). The symbolic understanding \nof seven is carried into the NT where the idea that forgiveness has \nno limits is expressed by Jesus teaching to forgive\u0014\nseven times seventy (Matt 18:21-22).\u0014",

    "words": "Positively Protestant\u0014\n                                              Lets uncover the \noriginal meaning of the word.\u0014\nby David NeffDavid Neff, originally posted on the Ancient Evangelical \nFuture blogsite.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast summer, I received an essay from a frienda leading Evangelical \nintellectualwho said that the label Protestant should fade out in \nfavor of the label Evangelical because, in part, Protestant was \n\"negative.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many people's minds, it certainly is. It sounds like it is about \ndissent and disagreement. It evokes images of picketers carrying \npoorly made signs back and forth in front of a factory. Indeed, it \nsounds disagreeable.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore recently, another friend published an engaging account of his \nexploration of Catholicism. The book is Jon Sweeney's Almost \nCatholic, and you can read an excellent review of it on my wife \nLaVonne's blog.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book is a good read, but its argument rests in part on his \ncontrast between the \"universal\" character of Catholic faith and the \nnegative Protestant alternative:\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be Protestant is to define yourself as protesting against certain \nforms of religion.  there is little need for Protestants anymore. \nWhat are we still protesting? The Reformation of the sixteenth \ncentury was a European event.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo many seem to think that the essence of being Protestant is to \nconscientiously object to what is or was Roman Catholic. A little \nhistory and a little linguistic research shows Protestant to be a \nmuch more positive word, referring to what the original Protestants \nstood for rather than what they stood against.\u0014\n\u0014\nSweeney rightly ties Protestant to the Second Diet of Speyer (1529), \nand the response of the German evangelical princes to its decision to \nrestrict their freedom. But he misleadingly labels Protestant \"a \npolitical moniker,\" when the cultural context thoroughly mixed \nreligion and politics. The word religion certainly existed, but it \nremained for the Enlightenment to create it as a distinct category of \nthought and experience. Sixteenth-century people were more likely to \nthink in concrete terms of the overlapping authorities of king and \npope, bishop and prince, priest and magistrate. Neither religion nor \npolitics was an abstract category for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do the major historians of Protestantism say? Like almost all \ntheir colleagues, John Dillenberger and Claude Welch link the origin \nof the word Protestant to the 'Protestation' of the German \nevangelical estates in the second Diet of Speyer. But they see in \nthat term \"the duality of protest and affirmative witness.\" That \nprotest, they write, was\u0014\n\u0014\n    from the standpoint of affirmed faith. Few churches ever adopted \nthe name \"Protestant.\" The most commonly adopted designations were \nrather \"evangelical\" and \"reformed.\"  [W]hen the word Protestant \ncame into currency in England (in Elizabethan times), its accepted \nsignificance was not \"objection\" but \"avowal\" or \"witness\" or \n\"confession\" (as the Latin protestari meant also \"to profess\").\u0014\nThat meaning lasted for another century, say Dillenberger and Welch, \nand it referred to the Church of England's\u0014\n\u0014\n    making its profession of the faith in the Thirty-nine Articles \nand the Book of Common Prayer. Only later did the word \"protest\" come \nto have a primarily negative significance, and the term \"Protestant\" \ncome to refer to non-Roman churches in general.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting about the second Diet of Speyer, the esteemed Luther \nbiographer Roland Bainton called the word Protestant\u0014\n\u0014\n    unfortunate as a name because it implies that Protestantism was \nmainly an objection. The dissenters in their own statement affirmed \nthat \"they must protest and testify publicly before God that they \ncould do nothing contrary to His word.\" The emphasis was less on \nprotest than on witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nDiarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford \nUniversity, traces the history of the term. From 1529 until 1547, \nProtestant was limited to the sphere of German politico-religious \nlife, identifying those princes who followed Luther or Zwingli and \nwho in 1529 \"issued a protestatio, affirming the reforming beliefs \nthat they shared.\" The term entered English in 1547, when the \nofficials who were organizing the coronation of Edward VI listed \"in \norder the procession of dignitaries through [London].\" There, in that \nlist, was a place for \"'the Protestants,' by whom they meant the \ndiplomatic representatives of [the] reforming Germans.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Edward VI was crowned, the word still had a positive \nconnotation. On the CultureVulture blog for the Guardian, Sean Clarke \nnotes that it was 60 years from the introduction of Protestant in \nEnglish until its first use in the extended sense of \"object, \ndissent, or disapprove.\" That (according to the Collins Etymological \nDictionary) was first recorded in English in 1608. The Online \nEtymological Dictionary places the first use of protest to mean \n\"statement of disapproval\" in the year 1751another century and a \nhalf. Through much of that history and well after, protest continued \nto mean \"avow,\" \"affirm,\" \"witness,\" or \"solemnly proclaim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPoor, misunderstood protest has had a history something like that of \nanother wordapology. That word has gone from its positive, \nhead-held-high sense of \"a formal justification or defense\" (as in \n\"the essay was an apology for capitalism\") to something tinged with \nshame and remorse (\"a statement of regret or request for pardon\").\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need to recover the positive sense of protestant. It denotes \nthings that we stand for: the authority of Scripture, salvation by \ngrace through faith in Christ alone. It's a matter of principle. And \nbecause it is about standing for truth, Catholics can be protestants \ntoo.\u0014",

    "words": "Don't you just miss those good-old days? As good as they were, women \n50 or 60 years ago still had too much freedom. The liberated women of \nthe 1950s had many privileges. They simply weren't submissive enough. \nI suggest that we as Christians must return to a truly biblical \nunderstanding of how men should treat women.\u0014\n \u0014\nWomen must go back to being the property of men. Her body belongs to \nthe man who happens to own her--first her father, then her husband \n(Ex 20:17).\u0014\n \u0014\nAs soon as she reaches puberty (around the ages of 11 to 13) her \nvirginity should be sold to the highest bidder. \u0014\n \u0014\nAnd frankly, why should we men settle for just one woman, when the \nBible gives us so many more options? Why not revive the biblical \npractice of having concubines (1 Ki 11:3), sex slaves (Dt 21:10-14) \nand enjoy the occasional pleasures of a prostitute (Gen 38:15)?\u0014\n \u0014\nNot only could we return to these biblical examples on how to treat \nour women, but look to the text on how to treat our children. If my \nchildren disrespect me, I have full biblical authority to kill them \n(Lev 20:9).\u0014\n \u0014\nAnd while Bruce Ware helps us understand why wife beating is \njustifiable for not submitting to men, I say they should be stoned. \nThe Bible teaches us that if the bride was not a virgin on her \nwedding night, then execution was the consequence (Dt 22:13-21).\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen listening seriously to the views of Tom Nelson and Bruce Ware, \nit is important to realize that sexism is but one aspect of what it \nmeans to be a white man with economic privilege. Women must be kept \nin their place, because once they are liberated, all types of other \ngroups would want to also be liberated. \u0014\n \u0014\nTo be a white man in the good old days of 50 to 60 years ago--and to \nthe Tom Nelsons and Bruce Wares of today--implies both domination and \nprotection of those under you: women as well as non-white males. It \nbecomes the white man's responsibility, his burden, to educate and \nChristianize those below his superior standards.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee full article in Word \"My Documents\" Show Me a Sexist; I'll Show \nYou a Racist\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel A.

With 260 tons of \nfrozen birds to get rid of, a company salesman named Gerry Thomas \nordered 5,000 aluminum trays, recruited an assembly line of women \narmed with spatulas and ice-cream scoops and began creating \nmini-feasts of turkey, corn-bread dressing, peas and sweet potatoes  \ncreating the first-ever TV dinner. Thomas later said he got the idea \nfrom neatly packaged airplane food.\u0014\n\u0014\nThanksgiving is ruled by two very powerful f-words: \"food\" and \n\"football.\" Nearly as old as the sport itself, the tradition of \nwatching football on Thanksgiving began in 1876, when the newly \nformed American Intercollegiate Football Association held its first \nchampionship game. Less than a decade later, more than 5,000 club, \ncollege and high school football teams held games on Thanksgiving, \nwith match-ups between Princeton and Yale drawing more than 40,000 \nfans out from their dining rooms. 1934 marked the first NFL game held \non Thanksgiving when the Detroit Lions took on the Chicago Bears. The \nLions have played on Thanksgiving ever since  except, of course, \nwhen the team was called away to serve during World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman who wrote the classic nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little \nLamb\" also played an integral role in making Thanksgiving a national \nholiday. After a 17-year letter-writing campaign, magazine editor \nSarah Josepha Hale finally convinced President Abraham Lincoln to \nissue an 1863 decree recognizing the historic tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the first Thanksgiving was held in 1621, it would take more \nthan 150 years before all 13 colonies celebrated Thanksgiving at \nonce, in October 1777. In 1789, George Washington hailed the holiday, \nwhile President Thomas Jefferson scoffed at the notion, calling \nThanksgiving \"the most ridiculous idea\" ever conceived. For his part, \nBenjamin Franklin had such an affinity for turkey that he lobbied to \nmake it the national bird (to no avail).\u0014",

    "words": "The Origins of New Years' Resolutions\u0014\nChris Armstrong, Chrisitianity Today \u0014\n\u0014\nLike other Christian festivals, the celebration of New Years Day in \nthe West started before the church came into existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first, the Romans celebrated the beginning of the new year on \nMarch 1, not January 1. Julius Caesar instituted New Year's Day on \nJanuary 1 to honor Janus, the two-faced god who looks backwards into \nthe old year and forwards into the new. The custom of \"New Years \nresolutions\" began in this earliest period, as the Romans made \nresolutions with a moral flavor: mostly to be good to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Rome took on Christianity as its official faith, the Christians \nkept New Years Day. Only, they traded the vaguely moral emphasis for \na practice of fasting and prayer aimed at living the New Year in the \nNew Life of Christ. Soon, however, the new year celebration reverted \nto March 1, and this early emphasis on spiritual things dissolved.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr rather, it shifted to a new celebration on January 1. Beginning in \nthe middle of the sixth century, parts of the church began to set \naside January 1 as the Feast of the Circumcision, commemorating \nJesus' circumcision. As with other Jewish boy babies, Jesus was \ncircumcised eight days after his birth (Luke 2:21, \"when eight days \nwere accomplished\").\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the pagans had apparently spoiled January 1 for many Christians: \nthe Roman church did not accept this feast day until the 11th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was finally in 1752, when Britain and its possessions adopted the \nGregorian calendar, that January 1 again came to be recognized and \ncelebrated as the first day of the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Christians, however, still hesitated to celebrate the day. The \nPuritans, for example, were leery of the associations of January 1 \nwith the pagan god Janusthey preferred not even to say the name of \nthe month, referring to it rather as \"First Month.\" And of course \nthey stood against the dissipations usually indulged during the \ncelebration.\u0014",

    "words": "Reconciling Differences between Two Canonical Gospels\u0014\n\u0014\n         Scholars have come to believe that some of the stories of \nJesus' life in the New Testament Gospels contain discrepancies \nbetween each other. Consider, for example, the Gospels of Mark and \nJohn.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The Gospels of Mark and John both give readers an account of \nwhen Jesus was crucified in relation to the Last Supper though the \nnature of this meal differs. Mark specifically refers to the event as \nthe Passover meal, while John does not.\u0014\n                 \u0014\n         Both Mark and John give us a precise description of when, in \nrelationship to\u0014\nthe Passover meal, Jesus was crucified.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Both Mark and John indicate that Jesus died during the Feast \nof the Passover, the annual festival celebrated by Jews in Jerusalem \nto commemorate the events of the Exodus. The festival had as its \nbackground the stories of God's deliverance of his people Israel from \ntheir slavery in Egypt, through Moses, as recorded in the book of \nExodus in the Hebrew Bible. In Jesus' day, the festival was a major \nevent. Jews came from around the world to celebrate the feast in \nJerusalem. They would arrive a week in advance to undergo a ritual of \npurification that would allow them to eat the meal. They needed to be \nritually pure for a week, and so they'd come a week early.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The afternoon before the Passover meal was eaten, Jews would \nbring a lamb, which was to be eaten as part of the celebration, to \nthe temple, or else they would purchase a lamb there at the temple so \nthat it could be sacrificed by the priests. The rest of the day was \nspent in preparing the meal for that evening. That day, when they \nprepared the meal, therefore, was called the day of preparation for \nthe Passover. Now, it's important to remember that in Jewish \nreckoning, a new day begins not at midnight as it does for us, but \nwhen it gets dark. Even today, Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday \nevening at dark and continues through Saturday until it gets dark \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\n         During the festival, after the lambs were sacrificed, their \nblood drained, they were given back to the Jewish worshipers, who \ntook them home to cook them for the meal, which was then eaten after \nit got darkthat is, on the day of Passover itself. The meal itself \nconsisted of several symbolic foods to recall Israel's slavery in \nEgypt and deliverance by God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word\\My Documents\\Reconciling Difference \nBetween Two Canonical Gospels\u0014",

    "title": "RINGO STARR 70, THE BEATLES, AGELESS",
    "words": "July 6, 2010\u0014\nRingo Starr, at Age 70. The Beatles, Ageless.\u0014\nBy EDUARDO PORTER\u0014\n\u0014\nRingo Starr is turning 70 on Wednesday. It feels as though youth \nitself is now 70 years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nI wasnt yet 6 when the Beatles played their last live performance \natop the Apple Corps building on Savile Row in London, January 1969. \nThey split four years before I got my first Beatles album. Still, I \ncan keep track of my teenage years by Beatles songs I happened to be \nenthralled with at the time. Forty years after they broke up, my \n6-year-old son is learning to play Eleanor Rigby on the piano. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only are the Beatles the best-selling act of all time, but \neverybody has done their songs, from Jimi Hendrix to David Bowie to \nElton John. Strawberry Fields Forever has been covered by Aimee \nMann and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs of Argentina. The Brazilian band Os \nMutantes sneaked the guitar solo from While My Guitar Gently Weeps \ninto its hit Ando Meio Desligado. Sesame Streets songbook includes \nHey Food, and Letter B. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2001, the compilation album 1 was a top seller in the United \nStates and Britain. Its beyond an obsession. Its an ideal for \nliving, Noel Gallagher of the 1990s British-pop band Oasis once \nsaid. With every song that I write, I compare it to the Beatles. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is somewhat odd that the musical tastes of todays youth are still \nlinked closely to a band that released its last album when the \nparents of todays teenagers hadnt even met and music still came on \nvinyl. When Ringo was born, the median life expectancy in the United \nStates was only 63. More than half the 20-somethings who paid $4.50 \nfor a ticket to their last concert in Candlestick Park in 1966 are \ndead by now. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe the famously self-centered boomer generation into which the \nBeatles poured their music never grew up. Like no generation before, \nboomers crafted identities out of tastes for music, dress and \npolitics. As we moved into middle age, we brought along the Beatles \nand passed them on to our kids. \u0014\n\u0014\nWherever it comes from, there is some unique quality about what the \nBeatles had to offer. Its not as good as eternal youth, but it is a \nclose second. To me, their music does not sound any older than when \n64 was a much longer way off. Maybe this is what we mean by \ntimelessness. Its turning 70 while remaining 24 at the same time. \u0014\n\u0014\nEDUARDO PORTER\u0014",

    "title": "RESCUE THE PERISHING",
    "words": "In 1869, Fanny Crosby was addressing a group of working class men in \nNew York City. It was a hot summer evening and she was sharing the \ngospel message of redemption. As she spoke a nagging thought kept \nrunning through her mind. She felt, somewhere in the crowd of \nworkers, there was a boy who had wandered from his mother's home and \nteaching. So she made the plea that if there was such a man in the \naudience, he should come to her at the end of the service. In her own \nwords Crosby recounts what happened next. \"A young man of eighteen \ncame forward and said, 'Did you mean me? I promised my mother to meet \nher in heaven, but as I am now living that will be impossible.' We \nprayed for him and he finally arose with a new light in his eyes and \nexclaimed in triumph, 'Now I can meet my mother in heaven, for I have \nfound God.' \" When Crosby returned home she sat down and composed the \nhymn \"Rescue the Perishing\" in a single day. The lyrics came to her \nas she reminisced about the lost youth she met in New York City.\u0014\n\u0014\nRescue the perishing, care for the dying,\u0014\nSnatch them in pity from the grave;\u0014\nWeep over the erring one. Lift up the fallen,\u0014\nTell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.\u0014\nRescue the perishing, Care for the dying;\u0014\nJesus is merciful, Jesus will save.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote that the young man said, \"as I am living now.\" There was a need \nfor a change in his life. Helped by the witness and love of Fanny \nCrosby the man was able to change his life's orientation and live \nobedient unto God. We have in our lectionary reading today that as \nthe people of Judah are living in disobedience they will be judged by \nGod. We have before us a hymn that expresses a concern for the souls \nof others and is a summons for repentance. God will always seek to \nrescue the perishing, for as Isaiah began his hymn \"I will sing for \nthe one I love.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Robert Murray McCheyne (1813-1843), Scottish divine, youngest son of \nAdam McCheyne, writer to the signet, was born in Edinburgh, 21 May \n1813. At the age of four he knew the characters of the Greek \nalphabet, and was able to sing and recite fluently. He entered the \nhigh school in his eighth year, and matriculated in November 1827 at \nEdinburgh University, where he showed very versatile powers, and \ndistinguished himself especially in poetical exercises, being awarded \na special prize by Professor Wilson for a poem on 'The Covenanters.' \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the winter of 1831 he commenced his studies in the Divinity Hall, \nunder Dr. Chalmers and Dr. Welsh; and he was licensed as a preacher \nby the Annan presbytery on 1 July 1835. In the following November he \nwas appointed assistant to the Rev. John Bonar of Larbert and \nDunipace, Stirlingshire. His health, which had never been robust, \nbroke down under the strain of his new office; but his fame as a \npreacher spread through Scotland, and on 24 November 1836 he was \nordained to the pastorate of St. Peter's Church, Dundee, which had \nbeen erected into a quoad sacra parish in the preceding May. The \ncongregation numbered eleven hundred hearers, and McCheyne addressed \nhimself to the work of the ministry with so much ardour that his \nhealth again gave way, and in December 1838 he was compelled to \ndesist from all public duty. At this time the general assembly of the \nchurch of Scotland decided to send a committee to Palestine to \ncollect information respecting the Jews, and McCheyne was included in \nthe number who set sail on 12 April 1839. The record of this journey \nwas written jointly by McCheyne and his companion Andrew Bonar (died \n1892), and was published in 1842. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his return at the end of 1839 McCheyne resumed his ministerial \nduties in Dundee with renewed energy. In the autumn of 1842 he \nvisited the north of England on an evangelical mission, and made \nsimilar journeys to London and Aberdeenshire. On his return from the \nlatter place he was seized with sudden illness, and died on Saturday, \n25 March 1843. He was buried beside St. Peter's Church, Dundee, where \nan imposing tombstone marks his grave.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcCheyne devoted all his energies to preaching; and although he was \nan accomplished Hebrew scholar, he left few permanent proofs of his \nerudition. He had refined musical taste, and was one of the first of \nthe Scottish ministers to take an active part in the improvement of \nthe congregational service of praise. Long after his death he was \nconstantly referred to as 'the saintly McCheyne.' Several hymns by \nhim  notably that entitled 'When this passing World is done'  are \nin constant use in the Scottish churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nM'Cheyne was a preacher, a pastor, a poet, and wrote many letters. He \nwas also a man of deep piety and a man of prayer. He never married.\u0014",

Your pastor has just died. He taught a heretical \ndoctrine--that Jesus wasn't really divine. Would your church riot \nover who to have as its next leader? Would it choose as its \ncompromise candidate a lawyer who had never even been baptized?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is just what happened in Milan, Italy, in 374. The bishop of \nMilan had supported the Arian heresy, which denied Christ was fully \nGod. When he died, the Milanese rioted. Some wanted an Arian bishop. \nOthers wanted an orthodox teacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmbrose was a 35 year old lawyer in town, the son of a nobleman, and \nso skilled in oratory that the governor of Northern Italy had \ndesignated him as his successor. This intelligent young man pushed \nhis way through the seething crowd and pleaded with them to maintain \nthe peace. His arguments must have been persuasive: Someone shouted, \n\"Ambrose for bishop!\" and soon everyone had picked up the chant.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmbrose protested. This was the furthest thing from his mind. Why, he \nhadn't even been baptized! But his protests were of no use. The \npeople wanted him. When Emperor Valentinian approved the selection of \nAmbrose and threatened severe penalties against anyone who helped \nhide the lawyer, Ambrose gave in and was baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nEight days later, on this day, December 7, 374,Ambrose was \nconsecrated bishop of Milan. He took his new responsibilities \nseriously. He gave all his possessions to the poor and boned up on \ntheology. With his legal skills and Greek learning, he defended the \nchurch and its people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oratorical skills of the lawyer did not desert him when he took \nthe pulpit. He spoke ad lib, not writing out his sermons. These were \nso good that the great Augustine of Hippo was won to Christ through \nlistening to him. Ambrose was a defender of orthodoxy against \nArianism. He kept up a frequent correspondence with Basil the Great, \na famed bishop of the Middle East. Because of Ambrose's writings, he \nis classed with Jerome, Augustine and Gregory the Great as one of the \nfour Latin church fathers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBold where the church was concerned, Ambrose even barred Emperor \nTheodosius from entering the sanctuary until the ruler publicly \nrepented of a massacre he had perpetrated in Thessalonica. One \nstipulation he placed on the emperor was that he must allow thirty \ndays to elapse between ordering any death sentence and carrying it \nout, so that he would have time to cool down and change his mind if \nnecessary.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe counseled gentleness rather than harshness with those who had \nbetrayed the faith under torture. \"Therefore the Lord Jesus had \ncompassion upon us in order to call us to Himself, not frighten us \naway. He came in meekness, He came in humility, and so He said: 'Come \nunto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh \nyou.' So, then, the Lord Jesus refreshes, and does not shut out nor \neast off, and fitly chose such disciples as should be interpreters of \nthe Lord's will, as should gather together and not drive away the \npeople of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmbrose died on Good Friday in 397. As he lay dying he extended his \narms like Christ on the cross. Christ appeared to him in his last \nagony. His death made such an impression on the public that five \nbishops could hardly cope with all the people who requested to be \nbaptized the next day.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ambrose, Saint, of Milan.\" New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of \nReligious Knowledge.

    "words": "January 7, 1275 \u0014\nRaymond of Penafort Wanted to Win Muslims\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nRaymond of Penafort was the kind of man that scholars listen to and \npopes honor. An example of this thirteenth-century scholar's \nqualities was his concerned to win Muslims to Christ. It was he who \nurged Thomas Aquinas to prepare definitive arguments that the \nDominican missionaries could use in reasoning with the Islamic \nphilosophers. It was probably because of Raymond's suggestion that \nthe renowned philosopher prepared his vast Summa contra Gentiles \n(Compendium against the Gentiles).\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn near Barcelona, Spain in 1175, Raymond was acutely aware of \nMuslims and Jews, because of the Moorish conquest of Spain. Much of \nhis life, he would be interested in winning them to Christ. He became \na notable teacher of such subjects as rhetoric and canon law. \nEventually he was invited to Italy, where he taught for several \nyears. But he wanted something more. The preaching of Reginald, the \nprior of the Dominicans in Bologna, attracted him. He decided to \nrenounce all of his honors and return to Spain in 1222 where he \njoined the Dominicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaymond wrote an important work on penitence. One of those who came \nto Raymond in repentance was Peter Nolasco. With assistance from \nRaymond and King James of Aragon, Peter formed the order called \nMercedarians to ransom Christians held by the Moors (North African \nMoslems). Raymond rebuked King James of Aragon for sin. Eventually \nJames repented, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Gregory IX commanded Raymond to collect and arrange a vast, \nscattered body of canon law. (These are church laws that govern \nmorals, faith and discipline.) Once Raymond completed this \ncollection, Gregory declared that it was the only collection with \nauthority. It alone was to be used in the schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Gregory wanted to make Raymond an archbishop. Raymond refused. \nThe Dominicans, however, chose him as their general. He served for \ntwo years, then resigned, saying his health wasn't up to the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the rest of his life, he worked hard to convert Muslims and Jews. \nTo help this cause, he established a school of Hebrew and Arabic \nstudies. By his death, an estimated 10,000 Muslims had taken baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaymond died in 1275. He was about ninety years old. In 1601, Pope \nClement VIII canonized him (named him a saint).

    "words": "January 4, 1934 \u0014\nReformed Churches Muzzled but Protest at Barmen\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler's Nazi regime in Germany was one of the most heinous in all \nhistory. However, when it first came to power, it was welcomed by \nmany German church members. One church leader even said that Hitler's \nrise was a gift of mercy from God's hand. We can understand his \nthinking only if we remember that it was still early in Hitler's rule \nand that many Germans were afraid the Communists would take over \ntheir country if not opposed by the Nazis. Furthermore, Hitler \nreplaced the decadent Weimar Republic that had produced a literature \nand art of despair. Large numbers of Germans hoped that Hitler would \nbring spiritual renewal because he talked about their history and \ntraditions. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the churches in Germany were Lutheran, organized into \nprovinces. A movement took fire to nationalize the church under a \nsingle Reichs-bishop. This was actually a trick to bring the church \nunder Nazi control. In May, 1933, the unified national church \nproduced its constitution. The so-called \"German Christians\" elected \nLudwig Mller, a fervent Nazi, to head it. In July, he placed two \nrestrictions on the clergy. A clergyman (1) must be politically \nreliable and (2) must accept the superiority of the Aryan race. \nHundreds of clergy accepted these demands.\u0014\n\u0014\nA small group of church leaders did not. They openly opposed those \nGerman Christians who did accept the government's terms. The \ndissidents insisted that the church must obey Christ apart from \npolitical influence. In September, 1933, Martin Niemoeller sent a \nletter to all German pastors, inviting them to join a Pastor's \nEmergency League to oppose the unified church. Karl Barth and \nDietrich Bonhoeffer were among those who joined him. In October, \nNiemoeller asked pastors to bind themselves by the scripture and the \nold confessions of faith. They pledged themselves to protest certain \nviolations of the faith, to stand with the persecuted, and to \nacknowledge that Aryanism (with its claim of racial superiority) was \na violation of Reformation and Christian teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheologian Karl Barth, world-famous for a commentary he wrote on St. \nPaul's letter to the Romans, issued a refutation of Unified Church \ndoctrines, and Fundamentals a paper against the teaching of the \nGerman Christians. He said that the source of all the errors of the \nso-called German Christians was that they asserted German \nnationality, history, and politics were to be given equal weight with \nscripture. Many pastors saw their error and resigned from the Unified \nChurch after Barth wrote this.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, January 4, 1934, Reich-bishop Mller issued a decree \nwhich he pretended was needed to restore order in the German \nEvangelical Church. This decree became known as the \"Muzzling Order,\" \nbecause it forbade ministers to say anything in their sermons about \nthe Church controversy. Mller ordered churchmen to preach nothing \nbut \"the pure gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut faithful ministers would not allow themselves to be kept out of \npolitics by such an order--not when politics violated the deepest \nprinciples of faith. In fact, the very day that Mller issued his \ndecree, three hundred and twenty elders and ministers were already \ngathered at Barmen, calling themselves the First Free Reformed Synod. \nThey accepted Karl Barth's \"Declaration on the Correct Understanding \nof the Reformation Confessions in the Evangelical Church...\" More \nmeetings were held in the months that followed. In April, pastors who \nopposed Hitler formed the Confessing Church, which they called the \n\"legal Protestant church of Germany.\" It included Lutheran, Reformed, \nand United churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Confessing Church took its name because it clung to the Church's \ngreat historical Confessions of faith. In May 1934, the Confessing \nChurch issued the Barmen Declaration, rejecting errors of the \nNazi-controlled Unified Church. The Confessing Church stood almost \nalone in Germany against Nazi lies during the terrible years of the \nthird Reich. Because of their boldness, its leaders paid a steep \nprice.

    "words": "January 22, 1973 \u0014\nRoe vs. Wade: Abortion's Religious Dimension\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL    A Conservative's View\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the U. S. Supreme Court handed down the Roe v. Wade decision, on \nthis day, January 22, 1973, they hoped to end increasing controversy \nover a practice which was allowed in limited instances in some states \nbut almost never in others. Instead, their decision polarized the \nAmerican people and American politics. In its ruling, the court \nstruck down a Texas law which prohibited abortion except when \nnecessary to save a mother's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs is usual when a ruling defies custom and popular conscience, the \ndecision could only be achieved through deception. The woman known as \nJane Roe (Norma McCorvey, now a Christian and a pro-life advocate) \nhas acknowledged that she perjured herself in her testimony. She also \nsays she was lied to by her counsel. Supreme Court memos show that \npro-abortion Supreme Court justices (especially William O. Douglas), \nknowing they had no precedent, plotted to \"finesse\" the issue.\" The \nruling flew in face of scientific evidence which increasingly shows \nthat a baby in the womb is very human. With modern technology, \npremature infants have survived at younger and younger ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the court did in its divided opinion was to develop a new \njudicial theory--that a woman has a constitutionally protected right \nto privacy. The U.S. Constitution does not mention any such right, \nbut the Court read it into the l4th Amendment which prohibits a state \nfrom unreasonably interfering with life, liberty, and property. The \ncourt expanded the meaning of the word \"liberty\" to guarantee a \nwoman's right to privacy in choosing an abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the court said that the liberty guaranteed by the fourteenth \namendment protects the woman's right to privacy, at the same time the \ncourt held that it did not protect the unborn, since the court \narbitrarily determined that a fetus is not a person and thus not a \nconcern of the court. Roe v. Wade further permitted abortion to \nprevent the mother from future mental or physical distress in caring \nfor the child. Thus the Court placed the personal choices of the \nmother above the life of her unborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nNumerous jurists--even those who favor abortion--have observed that \nRoe v. Wade ignored constitutional precedent. In fact, the decision \noverturned laws regulating abortions in every one of the fifty states.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians protest the Court's ruling as immoral. They see the \ndecision as an expression of an individualistic and secular society \nin which people try to live their lives independent of God's laws, \nprinciples, and truths. They teach that our bodies are not our own, \nbut on loan to us from God and humans are made in the image of God \nand therefore to be valued. Roe v. Wade has become a central issue in \nthe conflict over which principles should govern American society.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History story.\u0014\n\" 'Jane Roe' Tells True Story Behind Roe v.

    "words": "February 20, 1636 \u0014\n\u0014\nRutherford Exiled for Publishing\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNot many pastors rise at 3 A.M. to be sure they have sufficient time \nfor God and their people. Samuel Rutherford was one who did. Thus it \ncame as a great blow to him when he was compelled to leave the folk \nhe loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRutherford had published an Apology of Divine Grace against the \nheresy of righteousness based on human works. This work offended the \ngovernment. On February 20, 1636, Archbishop Laud, who controlled the \nestablished churches of Britain, exiled Rutherford to Aberdeen. He \nforbade him to preach anywhere in Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem Rutherford could not be blamed if he slipped into \ndepression. The years had not been kind to him. In 1630, after barely \nfive years of marriage, his wife died following a painful illness of \nthirteen months. Their two children also died, and Samuel himself \nsuffered a debilitating fever for three months. Now he was in exile, \nexcluded from the work he cherished most.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut rather than become depressed, he wrote encouraging letters to his \nfriends and his church home. These are full of wise and pithy \nsayings: \"Duties are ours, and events are the Lord's.\" Or, \"It is not \nfor us to set an hourglass to the Creator of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hundreds of letters he wrote in exile became a classic. Full of \nencouragement and loving devotion to Christ, they showed that \nRutherford had an intimate communion with the Lord and was not afraid \nto talk about it. He always wrote about Christ and the wondrous glory \nof His Person. Charles Haddon Spurgeon later said, \"When we are dead \nand gone, let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters \nto be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the \nwritings of mere man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638 Rutherford was restored to his church. His many sufferings \ngave him even greater sympathy for the suffering in his flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1640s, Rutherford represented the church of Scotland in \nthe Westminster Assembly in London. He helped author the Shorter \nCatechism, with its famous beginning, \"What is the chief end of man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGlimpses #95.

    "words": "Rape Apology to Give 'Closure'\u0014\nMarch 30, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nRecy Taylor hadnt asked for much. More than six decades after she \nwas raped by six white men in her hometown of Abbeville, Alabama  a \nhorrific crime that the sheriffs department covered up, never to \nspeak of again  she wasnt interested in reopening the case or \npressing charges. Taylor, now 91 years old, just thought an apology \nwas in order.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday the Alabama House finally acted. By a unanimous voice \nvote, the body passed a resolution apologizing for the states \nfailure to pursue justice for Taylor, who was a 24-year-old \nsharecropper in 1944 when she was kidnapped and raped at gunpoint. An \nall-white jury in Jim Crow-era Alabama refused to indict her \nassailants. A subsequent investigation initiated by the governor's \noffice elicited some admissions of guilt, but without an indictment \nin the county in which the crime took place, the case couldn't go \nforward.\u0014\n\u0014\nExpressing deepest sympathies and solemn regrets, the resolution \ncalled the states response morally abhorrent and repugnant. It now \nmoves to the Senate. The resolution comes a week after Abbeville \nMayor Ryan Blalock and Henry County Probate Judge JoAnn Smith held a \npress conference apologizing to Taylors family for the way she was \ntreated. The influx of attention has came as a bit of a shock.\u0014\n\u0014\nI couldnt believe it happened so fast, Taylors 74-year-old \nbrother, Robert Corbitt, who lives in Abbeville, told The Root. After \nworking tirelessly for years, to no avail, for government officials \nto even recognize that the crime happened, he says hes grateful for \nthe recent surge of activity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt means that we have some closure, he said. What hurt Recy maybe \nmore than anything was the lies that were told on her. These men \nadmitted that they kidnapped and raped her, but law enforcement said \nit didnt happen. Not only that, they tried to say she was a \nprostitute when she was a Christian lady. Things like that really \nbothered her, so shes gotten some closure in the apology.\u0014",

    "title": "RETHINKING THE DEATH PENALTY",
    "words": "In March, the state of Illinois became the sixteenth state to abolish \nthe death penalty. In his remarks after signing the bill, Governor \nPat Quinn didnt debate the morality of executing murderers. He \ndidnt discuss whether or not the death penalty deters heinous \ncrimes. He didnt even linger on the fact that all but fewer than 60 \nnations around the world reject capital punishment. No countries in \nEurope, except Belarus, practice it; other countries which continue \nto use the death penalty include Afghanistan, China, Cuba, Iran, \nIraq, North Korea, and, of course, the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuinn simply said that our system of imposing the death penalty was \ndefective. \"Since our experience has shown that there is no way to \ndesign a perfect death penalty system, free from the numerous flaws \nthat can lead to wrongful convictions or discriminatory treatment, I \nhave concluded that the proper course of action is to abolish it,\" \nthe governor said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit organization \ndedicated to serving the media and the public with analysis and \ninformation on issues concerning capital punishment, reports that \nsince 1973, more than 130 people have been released from death row \nafter having been found innocent of the crimes which brought them \nthere. About five people per year are released after DNA or other \nevidence establishes their innocence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that only in the past decade or so has such information \nabout our criminal justice systems faults, as they relate to capital \npunishment, been established and revealed, shifting the conversation \nabout capital punishment away from debating morality and toward \nexposing abuse in the criminal justice system. That is, its only \nbeen in the last 10 or 15 years that we have become aware, as a \nnation, that issues such as prosecutorial misconduct, eyewitness \nerror, and even the false confessions of those who are mentally ill \nor intellectually disabled have resulted in the wrongful convictions \nof innocent people.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigative journalist Maurice Possley has had a lot to do with \nopening our nations eyes to the problems in the criminal justice \nsystem. Possley, a Pulitzer prize-winning author whose most recent \nbook, Hitler in the Crosshairs: a GIs Story of Courage and Faith \n(Zondervan) will be published later this month, is currently an \ninvestigator for the Northern California Innocence Project at the \nUniversity of Santa Claras School of Law. Prior to joining the \nInnocence Project, Possley spent almost 25 years at the Chicago \nTribune where, during his tenure, he covered the criminal cases of \nTimothy McVeigh and Ted Kaczynski, among many others. Eric Zorn, a \nChicago Tribune columnist, raised a virtual toast to Possley and \nhis colleagues in a column following Quinns decision. \u0014\n\u0014\nI recently spoke with Possley about Illinois Governor Quinns \ndecision to abolish the death penalty, a decision  not surprisingly \n which Possley supports. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe system isnt as perfect as we think it is, Possley said. And he \nshould know. When we spoke, the Innocence Projects investigative \nefforts had recently established the innocence of two more people. \nOne had been in prison for more than twenty years for a crime he did \nnot commit. Turning the conversation about the death penalty away \nfrom debating its morality to establishing whether it can be used \naccurately is a positive step, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one flippantly says, Well, I dont mind if an innocent person is \nexecuted. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile anti-death penalty activists rejoice in Illinois about the \nrecent repeal, across the country in Connecticut, state legislators \nwho support capital punishment scramble to introduce an amendment to \nspeed up the death penalty process in that state in case the death \npenalty is repealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe believe that abolishing capital punishment would jeopardize the \nsafety of the people of Connecticut, said Representative Steve \nMikutel. For justice to exist, the punishment must fit the crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new conversation about capital punishment doesnt need to tangle \nitself around how or whether we are given the right  by God or by \nsociety  to exact justice on criminals. It makes us ask, if the \ninmates on Connecticuts death row are executed quickly to circumvent \nthe repeal of capital punishment there, will innocent people be \nkilled?\u0014\n\u0014\nI might want to kill a person who has murdered one of my loved \nones, Possley said. But that doesnt mean its right. Do I want him \nto be locked up for the rest of his life? Yes. Do I want him to \nrepent? Yes. I dont think anyone is beyond redemption in Gods eyes, \nno matter how bad they are. When we kill someone, weve decided that \nthey are beyond Gods redemption. I cant accept that.\"\u0014",

    "title": "RESCUING THE REAL UNCLE TOM",
    "words": "June 13, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nRescuing the Real Uncle Tom\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DAVID S. REYNOLDS\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe, born 200 years ago today, was an \nunlikely fomenter of wars. Diminutive and dreamy-eyed, she was a \nharried housewife with six children, who suffered from various \nobscure illnesses worsened by her persistent hypochondria. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, driven by a passionate hatred of slavery, she found time to \nwrite Uncle Toms Cabin, which became the most influential novel in \nAmerican history and a catalyst for radical change both at home and \nabroad. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, of course, the book has a decidedly different reputation, \nthanks to the popular image of its titular character, Uncle Tom  \nwhose name has become a byword for a spineless sellout, a black man \nwho betrays his race. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we tend to think of the novel itself as an old-fashioned, rather \nlachrymose affair that features the deaths of an obsequious enslaved \nblack man and his blond, angelic child-friend, Little Eva. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this view is egregiously inaccurate: the original Uncle Tom was \nphysically strong and morally courageous, an inspiration for blacks \nand other oppressed people worldwide. In other words, Uncle Tom was \nanything but an Uncle Tom. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, thats why in the mid-19th century Southerners savagely \nattacked Uncle Toms Cabin as a dangerously subversive book, while \nNorthern reformers  especially blacks  often praised it. The \nex-slave Frederick Douglass affirmed that no one had done more for \nthe progress of African-Americans than Stowe. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book was enormously popular in the North during the 1850s and \nhelped solidify support behind the antislavery movement. As the black \nintellectual W. E. B. Du Bois later wrote, Thus to a frail \noverburdened Yankee woman with a steadfast moral purpose we \nAmericans, both black and white, owe our gratitude for the freedom \nand the union that exist today in these United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book stoked fires overseas, too. In Russia it influenced the 1861 \nemancipation of the serfs and later inspired Vladimir Lenin, who \nrecalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first \nAmerican novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled \nantislavery causes in Cuba and Brazil. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the heart of the books progressive appeal was the character of \nUncle Tom himself: a muscular, dignified man in his 40s who is \nnotable precisely because he does not betray his race; one reason he \npasses up a chance to escape from his plantation is that he doesnt \nwant to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed \nbecause he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are \nhiding. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Little Eva, she bravely accepts her coming death and says she \nwould gladly give her life if that would lead to the emancipation of \nAmericas enslaved blacks. Together Tom and Eva form an interracial \nbond that offers lessons about tolerance and decency. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions \nof Uncle Toms Cabin that inevitably sprung from its immense \npopularity. Indeed, Stowes novel yielded the most popular and one of \nthe longest-running plays in American history. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first dramatization of the novel appeared in 1852, the year it \nwas published, and countless others followed. By the 1890s, there \nwere hundreds of acting troupes  so-called Tommers  that fanned out \nacross North America, putting on Uncle Toms Cabin in every town, \nhamlet and city. Some troupes even toured internationally, performing \nas far away as Australia and India. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe play, seen by more people than read the book, remained popular up \nto the 1950s and still appears occasionally, including a staging last \nfall at the Metropolitan Playhouse in New York. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut as the story moved from the book to the stage, Stowes \nrevolutionary themes were drowned in sentimentality and spectacle. \nEvas death was frequently a syrupy scene in which the actress was \nhauled heavenward by rope or piano wire against a backdrop of angels \nand billowing clouds. \u0014\n\u0014\nUncle Tom, meanwhile, was often presented as a stooped, obedient old \nfool, the model image of a submissive black man preferred by \npost-Reconstruction, pre-civil rights America. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was this Uncle Tom, weakened both physically and spiritually, who \nbecame a synonym for a racial sellout by the mid-20th century. Black \nmusicians, sports figures, even establishment civil rights leaders \nwere all tarred with the Uncle Tom label, often by younger, more \nradical activists, as a way of demeaning them in the eyes of the \nAfrican-American community. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it doesnt have to be that way; Uncle Tom should once again be a \npositive symbol for African-American progress. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, many people who over the years were derided as Uncle Toms \n Jackie Robinson, Louis Armstrong and Willie Mays, to name a few  \nare now seen as brave racial pioneers. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, during the civil rights era it was those who most closely \nresembled Uncle Tom  Stowes Tom, not the sheepish one of popular \nmyth  who proved most effective in promoting progress. \u0014\n\u0014\nRosa Parks didnt mind the Uncle Tom label, since she believed that \ngreat change could result from nonviolent moral protest. The Rev. Dr. \nMartin Luther King Jr., though often called an Uncle Tom, also stuck \nto principled nonviolence. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheir form of protest was just as active as Toms, and just as \nstrong. Both Stowe and Tom deserve our reconsideration  and our \nrespect. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid S. Reynolds, a professor of American studies and English at the \nGraduate Center of the City University of New York, is the author of \nMightier Than the Sword: Uncle Toms Cabin and the Battle for \nAmerica.\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBRANCES OF MY FATHER",
    "words": "Remembrances of My Father\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLES M. BLOW , June 18, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nOccasionally, without warning, the drunken wreckage of my father \nwould wash up on our doorstep, late at night, stammering, laughing, \nreeking of booze. \u0014\n\u0014\nBang! Bang! Bang! Beating on the door, pleading to my mother to open \nit. These my boys just like they is yours! \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was on his way home from drinking, gambling, philandering, or some \ncombination thereof, squandering money that we could have used and \nwasting time that we desperately needed. Sometimes he was a stones \nthrow from our house in rural northern Louisiana. As a parting gift, \nhe would drop by to bless us with an incoherent 30 minutes of drunken \ndrivel, crumbs that I hungrily lapped up, time that would be lost to \nhim in the fog of a hangover by the time day broke. It was as close \nas I could get to him, so I took it. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the late-1970s. My parents were separated. My mother was now \nraising a gaggle of boys on her own. She was a newly minted \nschoolteacher. He was a juke-joint musician-turned-construction \nworker. \u0014\nHe spouted off about what he planned to do for us, buy for us. But \nthe slightest thing we did or said drew the response, you jus blew \nit. In fact, he had no intention of doing anything. The one man who \nwas supposed to be genetically programmed to love us, in fact, lacked \nthe understanding of what it truly meant to love a child  or to hurt \none. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo him, this was a harmless game that kept us excited and begging. In \nfact, it was a cruel, corrosive deception that subtly and unfairly \nshifted the onus of his lack of emotional and financial investment \nfrom him to us. \u0014\n\u0014\nI lost faith in his words and in him. I stopped believing. Stopped \nbegging. Stopped expecting. I wanted to stop caring, but I couldnt. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his \nfathers family that rendered him cold. Maybe it was the pain and \nguilt associated with a life of misfortune. Who knows. Whatever it \nwas, it stole him from us, and particularly from me. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile my brothers talked ad nauseam about breaking and fixing things, \nI spent many of my evenings reading and wondering. My favorite books \nwere a set of encyclopedias  the greatest single gift of my life  \ngiven by my uncle. The volumes were bound in white leather with red \nwriting on the covers. They allowed me to explore the world beyond my \nworld, to travel without leaving, to dream dreams greater than my \nlife would otherwise have supported. Id pick a volume at random  G \n and off Id go: gemstones and Ghana, Galileo and gravity. It was \nfantastic. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely \nlost to my father. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe could relate to my brothers tactile approaches to the world but \nnot to my cerebral one. He understood the very real sensation of \ntouching things  the weight of a good wrench, the tension of a \nguitar string, the soft hairs on the nape of a harlots neck  more \nthan the ephemeral magic of literature and learning. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, not understanding me, he simply ignored me  not just \nemotionally, but physically as well. Never once did he hug me, never \nonce a pat on the back or a hand on the shoulder or a tousling of the \nhair. I was forced to experience him as a distant form in a heavy \nfog, forced to nurse a longing that he was neither equipped nor \ninclined to satisfy. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy best memories of him were from his episodic attempts at \nengagement. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the longest of these episodes, once every month or two, he \nwould come pick us up and drive us down the interstate to Truckers \nParadise, a seedy, smoke-filled, truck stop with gas pumps, a \nconvenience store, a small dining area and a game room through a door \nin the back. It had a few video games, a couple of pinball machines \nand a pool table. Perfect. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy dad gave each of us a handful of quarters, and we played until \nthey were gone. He sat up front in the dining area, drinking coffee \nand being particular about the restaurants measly offerings. \u0014\n\u0014\nI loved these days. To me, Truckers Paradise was paradise. The \nquarters and the games were fun but easily forgotten. It was the \npresence of my father that was most treasured. But, of course, these \ntrips were short-lived. My father soon sank back into his sewer of \nbooze and women. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it was. Every so often he would make some sort of effort, but \nevery time it wouldnt last. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasnt until I was much older that I would find something that I \nwould be able to cling to as evidence of my fathers love. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Commodore 64 personal computer debuted, I convinced myself \nthat I had to have it even though its price was out of my mothers \nrange. So I decided to earn the money myself. I mowed every yard I \ncould find that summer for a few dollars each, yet it still wasnt \nenough. The grass just didnt grow fast enough. So my dad agreed to \nhelp me raise the rest of the money by driving me to one of the \nwatermelon farms south of town, loading up his truck with wholesale \nmelons and driving me around to sell them. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe came for me before daybreak. I climbed into the truck, which was \nlittered with months-old coffee cups, dirty papers and rusty tools \nand reeked of cigar smoke and motor oil. We made small talk, but it \ndidnt matter. The fact that he was talking to me was all that \nmattered. We arrived at the farm, negotiated a price and fussed over \nthe ones we would take. We loaded them, each one seemingly heavier \nthan the last, and we were off. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was a teenager by then, but this was the first time that I had ever \nspent time alone with him. It felt great. We drove around a \nneighboring town all afternoon selling melons to his friends. I got \nto see a small slice of his life. People smiled when he drove up. \nThey made jokes, some at his expense. He smiled and laughed and \nrepeatedly introduced me as my boy, a phrase he relayed with a \npalpable sense of pride. We didnt get back home until it was dark. \nIt was one of the best days of my life. Small gestures are easily \nmagnified when there is nothing against which to measure them. \u0014\n\u0014\nALTHOUGH he had never told me that he loved me, I would cling to that \nday as the greatest evidence of that fact. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had never intended me any wrong. He just didnt know how to love \nme right. He wasnt a mean man. I had never once seen him angry. He \nhad never been physically abusive in any way. His crime and his \ncruelty was the withholding of affection  not out of malice but out \nof indifference. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo I took these random episodes and clung to them like a thing most \nprecious, squirreling them away for the long stretches of coldness \nwhen a warm memory would prove most useful. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt just goes to show that no matter how estranged the father, no \nmatter how deep the damage, no matter how shattered the bond, there \nis still time, still space, still a need for even the smallest bit of \nevidence of a fathers love. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy boy.\u0014",

    "title": "REVIEW OF \"QUIVERING DAUGHTERS\"",
    "words": "Hillary McFarland reveals the idolatry of patriarchal Christianity. \u0014\nReview by Gina Dalfonzo | posted 6/23/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us tend to react with righteous indignation when we read \nstories of women in foreign countries denied higher education, the \nchance to support themselves, and the freedom to live independently \nand make their own decisions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we react when women are denied those same freedoms here in \nAmericaby some of our fellow Christians?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian patriarchya loosely organized movement encompassing \nQuiverfull, Stay-at-Home Daughters, and similar lifestyleshas been \ngaining more and more mainstream attention lately. From the pages of \nTime to cable reality shows, we're growing used to seeing families \nwho deliberately have as many children as possible, dress \nultra-conservatively, and observe a clear and unbreachable division \nof gender roles, to the point of preventing girls from going to \ncollege or working outside the home.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlogger Karen Campbell, who has written extensively on this movement, \ncoined the term patriocentric, which emphasizes the heart of the \npatriarchal philosophy: Translated, it literally means \n\"father-centered.\" Campbell defines the movement's central teaching \nas follows: \"that God gives a 'calling' in life to only men, \nspecifically fathers, and that the purpose of the wife and children \nis to fulfill the father's calling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her book Quivering Daughters, Hillary McFarland offers the rare \nand valuable perspective of a woman who actually grew up in a \npatriarchal Christian home. She shares both her own story and her \nconversations with other women who have come out of a similar \nbackground. Unlike some others who have left patriarchy behind, \nMcFarland has not lost her faith; her book, which is saturated in \nScripture, critiques patriarchy from a Christian viewpoint. Though \nMcFarland clearly loves and respects her parents, she writes frankly \nabout the spiritual abuse that she argues is inherent in their belief \nsystem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile that system is steeped in Christian terminology, one theme that \nemerges here is the pattern of idolatry practiced by McFarland's \nfamily and other families like hers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIdolatry of the past. McFarland opens her story with an account of \nhaving her hair washed with kerosene to remove lice: \"I lay in it, \ndrenched, my body on fire. I know [my mother's] hands burned too.\" \nBut \"Grandma Millie, our neighbor, said it worked because that's what \nthey did in the old days.\" (Never mind that it never actually got rid \nof the lice.) Everything, according to her parents, had to be based \non \"what they did in the old days\" because the old days were \nunequivocally better, case closed. \"Living frugally and biblically  \nmeant not relying on the conveniences of modern culture, but \nwelcoming hardship.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIdolatry of the parents, especially the father. McFarland was \ntaught as a child that she could experience God's leading only \nthrough her father, and that it was wrong for her even to hope to \nexperience it herself. As she astutely observes, this led to an \nenormous burden for father and children alike, as he struggled to \nmicromanage every aspect of their lives. Some of her diary entries, \nrecalling her feelings of despair at her father's constant \nfault-finding, are difficult to read. Like the time he scolded her \nfor tucking in her blouse because that showed her \"crotch and butt\" \nand could lead to her getting raped. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIdolatry of religion. This is perhaps the subtlest form of all. As \nMcFarland puts it, \"As a perfectionist who read the Bible every day \nand clung to commands to be perfect, holy, and to sin not, I \ncommitted idolatry.  I missed the voice that said Come to Me. Rest. \nI thought my obedience was the standard, not the love of Christ.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen rules and standards are exalted above God, it's not surprising \nthat law is emphasized over grace. This leads, McFarland tells us, to \nchildren who feel that they have to keep working for love even though \nthey believe they'll never be good enough for it. Quotes from the \nvarious daughters of patriarchy who talked to McFarland drive this \npoint homequotes like \"I was never patient or perfect enough.\" \"The \nguilt would just increase.\" \"There is so much pressure to conform.\" \n\"I thought I might be okaynot good, but okayenough for God because \nI was still wearing my long skirts every day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, McFarland writes, \"While Quiverfull teaching exalts \nchildren as supreme blessings, it doesn't reveal its grim \nundersidethe silent reality that takes place in hundreds of homes \nevery day and of which I learned: I am only a blessing when I'm \nuseful, helpful, obedient, cheerful, kind, unselfish, submissive, \ncompliant, and responsible.\" Later, she adds, \"We [children of \npatriarchy] see cognitive dissonance as 'blessings' essentially \nbecome 'property' to be manipulated and controlled.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat's even more disheartening is what happens to many of these \nchildren who grow up, break free, and share their stories. There \nseems to be a lack of understanding within the larger Christian \ncommunity as to the actual nature of patriarchy. Sometimes the \npatriarchal lifestyle is even romanticized, as people marvel over how \nwell-behaved the children seem and how adorable the girls look in \ntheir long dresses. All too often, Quivering Daughters warns, we fail \nto see the \"fear-based living\" and endless struggle for perfection \nbehind the scenes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a young woman were to share her story of physical or sexual \nabuseand occasionally, according to McFarland and others quoted in \nher book, it has come to thatshe would receive sympathy and support \nfrom other Christians. But if that young woman describes having \nessentially taken over her mother's job at an early age, working \nevery minute of the day with zero opportunity for rest, being robbed \nof her own childhood while she raised other children, being so \nexhausted that she longed to diethen she's likely to be told that \nshe was just lazy, selfish, and whiny.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've seen this happen more than once. It's happened to McFarland \nherself since her book was released. Stacy McDonald, author of \nRaising Maidens of Virtue and Passionate Housewives Desperate for \nGod, has set up a blog (no comments allowed) for the purpose of \ndebunking McFarland's account of her own upbringing. McDonald accuses \nMcFarland of exaggerating, and states that she just needs to \"get \npast this and move on.\" At one point, reviewing McFarland's advice to \nother young women like her, McDonald likens her to \"Satan  \nwhispering into the ear of a struggling sinner.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be noted that McFarland doesn't even urge girls from \npatriarchal homes to get out, unless their homes are \"unsafe\"; she \nonly stresses that they need to find and follow God's leading for \ntheir own lives, whether that means staying home or leaving. If Satan \nwere this mild a tempter, we'd still be in Eden.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut reactions like McDonald's show why it was so important that \nMcFarland tell her story. For patriocentricity isn't just another \nquaint evangelical fad. Whenever legalism and idolatry are taught in \nChrist's nameand Quivering Daughters makes a strong case that this \nis what's happeningChristians need to call it what it is: bad \ntheology leading to harmful beliefs and practices. If our calling, as \nChrist told us, is to serve \"the least of these my brethren,\" then we \nmust speak for those who have been rendered voiceless, not only by \nmembers of other religions, but by members of our own as well.\u0014",

    "title": "REMEMBERING IRENAEUS, BISHOP OF LYONS",
    "words": "June 28, 177 \u0014\n\u0014\nRemembering Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus' heart was full. He wished his friend Marcianus could be \nwith him so that they could talk about Christ, but that was \nimpossible. So he picked up his pen. They might be separated by \ndistance but a letter could capture his feelings. He dipped the quill \nin ink and began to write:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Knowing, my beloved Marcianus, your desire to walk in godliness, \nwhich alone leads man to life eternal, I rejoice with you and make my \nprayer that you may preserve your faith entire and so be pleasing to \nGod who made you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus wrote many things, not only to Marcianus, but to others. \nThese writings are of the utmost importance, for they show the state \nof Christianity in the second century after Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse teaching (heresy) had gained destructive power. In another \nlengthy writing, Irenaeus listed these and gave Christian answers to \ntheir false claims. One of his arguments was that only the universal \nchurch had the truth which it had passed from bishop to bishop. \nIrenaeus was in a strong position when making this claim. He had \npersonally known Polycarp, the martyred bishop from Asia Minor who in \nturn had known St. John and other apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne heresy of the day that Irenaeus took the trouble to answer was \nGnosticism. Gnosticism claimed that one needed a special, hidden \nknowledge if one's soul was to be saved. Irenaeus must have had this \nin mind when he wrote Marcianus:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This then is the order of the rule of our faith, and the foundation \nof the building, and the stability of our conversation: God, the \nFather, not made, not material, invisible; one God, the creator of \nall things: this is the first point of our faith. The second point \nis: The Word of God, Son of God, Christ Jesus our Lord...And the \nthird point is: The Holy Spirit, through whom the prophets \nprophesied, and the fathers learned the things of God, and the \nrighteous were led forth into the way of righteousness; and who in \nthe end of the times was poured out in a new way upon mankind in all \nthe earth, renewing man unto God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And for this reason the baptism of our regeneration proceeds through \nthese three points: God the Father bestowing on us regeneration \nthrough His Son by the Holy Spirit. For as many as carry (in them) \nthe Spirit of God are led to the Word, that is to the Son; and the \nSon brings them to the Father; and the Father causes them to possess \nincorruption.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus became a leader in the church in Lyons, France. In 177, the \nLyons' leadership sent him to Rome with a message.

    "words": "REVELATION--ADOPTION INTO THE CANON\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation may be alluded to by Ignatius (A.D. 110117) and Barnabas \n(before 135) and is probably used by the author of the Shepherd of \nHermas (\\c. 150).\\73 As we noted above under Author, Revelation is \nquoted as authoritative by (perhaps) Papias (\\d. 130), Justin (middle \nof the second century), and Irenaeus (180), and is found in the \nMuratorian Canon (180200?). Marcion rejected Revelation from his \ncanon (see Tertullian, \\Adv. Marc. 4.5), but this is not surprising, \nsince he rejected any New Testament book that smacked of the Old \nTestament or Judaismand Revelation is filled with Old Testament \nallusions. Eusebius also mentions that Revelation was rejected by a \nGaius, a church official in Rome at the beginning of the second \ncentury (\\H.E. 3.28.12). His reason was probably the use to which \nthe Montanists, a Christian sect that stressed prophecy and the \nnearness of the eschaton, were putting Revelation. By denying \ncanonical status to one of their most important books, Gaius could \nhope to discredit the movement.\\74 The same reason probably lies \nbehind the rejection of Revelation on the part of the group known as \nthe Alogoi. In any case, these scattered rejections of Revelation \nin the Western church did not affect its canonicity, and from this \npoint forward there is no hint of doubt about Revelations full \ncanonical status in the West.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe situation in the East was quite different. The authority accorded \nto Revelation by Papias and Justin was seconded by third-century \nscholars such as Clement of Alexandria and Origen. But the Egyptian \nbishop Dionysius disagreed. As we have seen, he questioned the \napostolic authorship of the book in an effort to minimize its \nauthority. His questions led other churchmen in the East to question \nits canonicity, among them Eusebius, who says that many in his day \nquestioned its status (H.E. 3.25.14). The Council of Laodicea (360) \ndid not recognize it as canonical, and it is omitted from the \nearliest editions of the Syriac Peshitta.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first sight, these doubts about Revelation seem somewhat \ndisturbing. But on closer examination, they can be seen to be \nsomewhat extraneous to the issue of canonicity. As Maier has shown in \ngreat detail, the doubts about Revelation stemmed from no considered \nargument or historical knowledge but were the result of distaste for \nthe eschatology of the book.\\75 Revelation seemed to teach, and was \ninterpreted by many in the early church to teach, a doctrine of the \nlast things that was too earthly focused, too materialistic for many \nof the Eastern fathers. We should not, then, be much influenced by \nthem in our assessment of the canonicity of the book. A similar point \nmust be made about latter-day critics of the Revelation. Luther, for \ninstance, relegated it to a secondary status in his New Testament, \nsaying, My spirit cannot accommodate itself to this book. There is \none sufficient reason for the small esteem in which I hold itthat \nChrist is neither taught nor recognized.\\76 One might wonder at this \npoint whether Luther was reading the same book that we have in our \nBibles, the book that makes the Lamb that was slain the linchpin in \nGods plan for history and the end of history. At any rate, such \ntheological prejudice should not be allowed to affect our judgments \nabout the books rightful place in the canon.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\\d. died\u0014\n\\Adv.

    "title": "REFORMATION FIGURES OF IMPORTANCE",
    "words": "The Reformation era produced many influential figures, including: \u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus (c. 1466-1536): The leading Christian humanist of the early \n16th century, whose \"philosophy of Christ\" sought the gradual moral \nimprovement of Christendom. \u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther (1483-1546): An obscure monk and professor in 1517, but \nby the spring of 1521 he had defied both the pope and Holy Roman \nEmperor on behalf of his understanding of Christian faith and life. \nThe reaction of the Church drove him to more and more radical \npositions. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles V (1500-1558): Holy Roman Emperor from 1519 until 1556, and \nstaunch defender of Catholicism and opponent of Protestantism. In \n1521, he issued the Edict of Worms condemning Luther. \u0014\n\u0014\nHuldrych Zwingli (1484-1531): The reformer whose influence was \nresponsible for the abolition of Catholicism and the adoption of \nProtestantism in the Swiss city of Zurich. His sharp disagreement \nwith Luther over the nature of the Lord's Supper found dramatic \nexpression in the Marburg Colloquy of 1529, preventing a political \nalliance between Zwinglian and Lutheran cities and setting the \nLutheran and Reformed Protestant traditions on divergent paths. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Mntzer (c. 1490-1525): An apocalyptic reformer who preached \nviolent revolution during the Peasants' War of 1525. Originally \nsympathetic to Luther, Mntzer progressively moved away from and \nridiculed him as a panderer to princes. In 1525, he led several \nthousand underarmed peasants into battle at Frankenhausen, where they \nwere slaughtered. Shortly thereafter, Mntzer was captured and \nexecuted. \u0014\n\u0014\nHenry VIII (1491-1547): The English king at whose behest the country \nsevered its longstanding institutional links to the Roman Catholic \nChurch and created a separate national church under royal control. \u0014\n\u0014\nIgnatius Loyola (1491?-1556): The founder of the Society of Jesus \n(the Jesuits), the most important Catholic religious order of the \nReformation era. \u0014\n\u0014\nJan van Leiden (1509-1536): The self-proclaimed prophet-king and \nruler of the Anabaptist Kingdom of Mnster in 1534-1535. Under van \nLeiden, the \"New Jerusalem\" practiced communal ownership of goods and \npolygamy. A siege finally broke the regime in 1535, and Jan was \nexecuted. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin (1509-1564): The leading reformer and theologian in the \nsecond generation of the Protestant Reformation. Calvin's Institutes \nof the Christian Religion is the single most important Protestant \ntheological work of the Reformation era. Calvinism became the most \ndynamic, influential form of Protestantism in Europe in the second \nhalf of the 16th century. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Knox (c. 1514-1572): An impassioned, uncompromising Calvinist \nreformer who played a leading role in the Scottish Reformation. \u0014\n\u0014\nMenno Simons (c. 1496-1561): The most influential Dutch Anabaptist \nleader in the wake of the ill-fated Anabaptist Kingdom of Mnster. \u0014\n\u0014\nHenry IV (de Navarre) (1553-1610): The French king whose conversion \nfrom Calvinism to Catholicism in 1593 helped bring an end to the \nFrench Wars of Religion with the Edict of Nantes in 1598.\u0014",

    "title": "RACHEL'S LAST FUNDRAISER",
    "words": "By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\nPublished: August 10, 2011  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps every generation of geezers since Adam and Eve has whined \nabout young people, and today is no different. Isnt it clear that in \ncontrast to our glorious selves, kids these days are self-absorbed \nFacebook junkies just a pixel deep?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, actually thats wrong at every level. This has been a depressing \ntime to watch todays adults, whose talent for self-absorption and \npolitical paralysis makes it difficult to solve big problems. But \nmany young people havent yet learned to be cynical. They believe, in \na wonderfully earnest way, in creating a better world. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of this grim summer, my faith in humanity has been \nrestored by the saga of Rachel Beckwith. She could teach my \ngeneration a great deal about maturity and unselfishness  even \nthough shes just 9 years old, or was when she died on July 23. \u0014\n\u0014\nRachel lived outside Seattle and early on showed a desire to give \nback. At age 5, she learned at school about an organization called \nLocks of Love, which uses hair donations to make wigs for children \nwho have lost their own hair because of cancer or other diseases. \nRachel then asked to have her long hair shorn off and sent to Locks \nof Love. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe said she wanted to help the cancer kids, her mother, Samantha \nPaul, told me. After the haircut, Rachel announced that she would \ngrow her hair long again and donate it again after a few years to \nLocks of Love. And thats what she did. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen when she was 8 years old, her church began raising money to \nbuild wells in Africa through an organization called charity:water. \nRachel was aghast when she learned that other children had no clean \nwater, so she asked to skip having a ninth birthday party. In lieu of \npresents, she asked her friends to donate $9 each to charity:water \nfor water projects in Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\nRachels ninth birthday was on June 12, and she had set up a birthday \npage on the charity:water Web site with a target of $300. Alas, \nRachel was able to raise only $220  which had left her just a bit \ndisappointed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen, on July 20, as Rachel was riding with her family on the \nhighway, two trucks collided and created a 13-car pileup. Rachels \ncar was hit by one of the trucks, and although the rest of her family \nwas unhurt, Rachel was left critically injured. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch members and friends, seeking some way of showing support, \nbegan donating on Rachels birthday page  charitywater.org/Rachel  \nand donations surged past her $300 goal, and kept mounting. As family \nand friends gathered around Rachels bedside, they were able to tell \nher  even not knowing whether she couldnt hear them  that she had \nexceeded the $47,544 that the singer Justin Bieber had raised for \ncharity:water on his 17th birthday. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think she secretly had a crush on him, but she would never admit \nit, her mom said. I think she would have been ecstatic. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it was clear that Rachel would never regain consciousness, the \nfamily decided to remove life support. Her parents donated her hair a \nfinal time to Locks of Love, and her organs to other children. Word \nspread about Rachels last fund-raiser.\u0014\n\u0014\nContributions poured in, often in $9 increments, although one \n5-year-old girl sent in the savings in her piggy bank of $2.27. The \ntotal donations soon topped $100,000, then $300,000. Like others, I \nwas moved and donated. As I write this, more than $850,000 has been \nraised from all over the world, including donations from Africans \nawed by a little American girl who cared about their continent. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has been so inspiring about Rachel is that she has taught the \nadults, said Scott Harrison, the founder of charity:water. Adults \nare humbled by the unselfishness of this little girl. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet this is a story not just of one girl, but of a generation of \nyoung people working creatively to make this a better world. Mr. \nHarrison is emblematic of these young people. Now 35, he established \ncharity:water when he was 30, and it has taken off partly because of \nhis mastery at social media. (Hes not as experienced in \nwell-drilling, so the wells are actually dug by expert groups like \nInternational Rescue Committee.) \u0014\n\u0014\nYouth activism has a long history, but this ethos of public service \nis on the ascendant today  and todays kids dont just protest \nagainst injustices, as my contemporaries did, but many are also \nremarkable problem-solvers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Ms. Paul, shes planning a trip on the anniversary of her \ndaughters death next year to see some of the wells being drilled in \nAfrica in her daughters name. Itll be overwhelming to see Rachels \nwells, she said, to see what my 9-year-old daughter has done for \npeople all over the world, to meet the people she has touched. \u0014\n\u0014\nRachel Beckwith, R.I.P., and may our generation learn from yours.\u0014",

We spent the quarter in Pauls letter to the Romans, an \nexercise in cross-cultural and theological study.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when we got to Romans 13 the rooms felt different, still and \nconfused.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere Anabaptists, Mennonites who are descendants of an illegal \nbreakaway from the Catholic Church. Early Anabaptists were hunted \ndown, drowned, tortured, and burned for the anti-government action of \nbaptizing one another upon confession of faith in Jesus Christ. This \nwas a political act, one that defied the authorities of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what do we make of Attorney General Jeff Sessions citing Romans 13 \nas an argument for separating parents from children at the \nU.S.-Mexico border? \u0014\n\u0014\nLet every person be subject to the governing authorities, writes \nPaul, for there is no authority except from God, and those \nauthorities that exist have been instituted by God (Rom. 13:1). He \ngoes on to say that rulers are not a terror for those who do good \nworks but only for those whose works are rooted in evil. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is one of the strangest assertions in the Bible. By the time Paul \nwrites this he has experienced hostility from all sorts of \nauthorities. He has been threatened and imprisoned for breaking the \nlaw. Eventually he will die for these legal transgressions.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Sunday school class talked through these strange contradictions. \nPerhaps this was a way to reiterate that God is in control of \neverything. Human institutions are no exception. In this reading Paul \nis telling the church in Rome that Caesar, with his claims of \ndivinity, is no more than a puppet with God pulling the strings.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr perhaps this was a warning against religious zealotry developing \nin the city of Rome, enthusiasts who refused to pay taxes on \nprinciple. Pauls words could be a reminder that, in the words of \nErnst Kasemann, the political sphere is certainly provisional. But \nonly enthusiasts fail to see that our worship is to be accomplished \nin provisional things by doing what has to be done in the given \nsituation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOr perhaps we should give attention to a popular Mennonite \ntheological claim that Romans 13 is to be read in conjunction with \nRomans 12. This previous chapter speaks to the character of the \nbeloved community, the forms life will take within Gods life in \nJesus. The call in Romans 13 is to live this Romans 12 life in \nsubmission, but never in obedience. It may be incumbent upon our \nwitness to the gospel to participate in a sit-in protesting unjust \nlaws, but we submit to the arrest we know will take place.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr perhaps Paul was involved in a smuggling operation, saying in \nRomans 13 the correct words that would allow his letter to \nsuccessfully make its way through the empires checkpoints between \nCorinth and Rome. James Scott calls this ancient technique a hidden \ntranscript. The internal orientation of the readers determines the \ninterpretation. External readers see only what they want to see. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm grateful for the exegetical work that helps to make sense of this \nodd chapter of Pauls letter to Rome. On some days I am more \nconvinced by one of these approaches than by others. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I am certain of this: the Bible is a weapon in the hands of \ncoercive power. Jeff Sessions, like other tyrants before him, \nutilizes scripture for the good of the empire, to keep people silent, \nin line, submissive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I looked around my Sunday school class on the day we studied \nRomans 13, I saw the people for whom these words were written down. A \nwoman who escaped religious persecution in Russia as an infant, \nboarding a ship with no destination. A man who watches his daughter \nstruggle through mental illness and addiction. A widow who nursed her \nhusband through a slow death from cancer. Two doctors who have spent \ntheir careers working at clinics for indigent patients.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn that circle, within those stories, welling up from those \nlivesthat is where biblical interpretation is meant to take place. \nThat is how the words of the Bible will be intelligible in the face \nof the questions and catastrophes of this day, of this time. And it \nis out of these interpretive communities that the violent powers of \nJeff Sessions and those like him are coming, ever slowly, to an end.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMelissa Florer-Bixler is pastor of Raleigh Mennonite Church in North \nCarolina and author of a book forthcoming from Herald Press.\u0014",

In \nrare cases the whole body is conserved, for example in the case of \nDudjom Rinpoche, after his death his physical body was moved a year \nlater from France and placed in a stupa in one of his main \nmonasteries near Boudhanath, Nepal in 1988. Pilgrims may view his \nbody through a glass window in the stupa. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Buddha's relics are considered to show people that enlightenment \nis possible, to remind them that the Buddha was a real person, and to \nalso promote good virtue.\u0014",

    "words": "Mark 5:27-29\u0014\n When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and \ntouched his cloak, 28 because she thought, If I just touch his \nclothes, I will be healed. 29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and \nshe felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark 6:56\u0014\nAnd wherever he wentinto villages, towns or countrysidethey placed \nthe sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even \nthe edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.\u0014\n\u0014\nActs 19:11-12\u0014\n God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, 12 so that even \nhandkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, \nand their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early church the disturbance, let alone the division, of the \nremains of martyrs and other saints was not practiced. They were \nallowed to remain in their often unidentified resting places in \ncemeteries and the catacombs of Rome, always outside the walls of the \ncity, but martyriums began to be built over the site of the burial, \nand it was considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to \nthe remains of saints, several large \"funerary halls\" being built \nover the sites of martyr's graves, including Old Saint Peter's \nBasilica. These were initially not regular churches, but \"covered \ncemeteries\" crammed with graves, and celebrating funerary and \nmemorial services. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia it may have \nbeen thought that when the souls of the martyrs went to heaven on \nresurrection day they would be accompanied by those interred nearby, \nwho would gain favour with God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Second Council of Nicaea in 787 drew on the teaching of St. John \nDamascene that homage or respect is not really paid to an inanimate \nobject, but to the holy person, and indeed the veneration of a holy \nperson is itself honour paid to God.The Council decreed that every \naltar should contain a relic, making it clear that this was already \nthe norm, as it remains to the present day in the Catholic and \nOrthodox churches. The veneration of the relics of the saints \nreflects a belief that the saints in heaven intercede for those on \nearth. A number of cures and miracles have been attributed to relics, \nnot because of their own power, but because of the holiness of the \nsaint they represent. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany tales of miracles and other marvels were attributed to relics \nbeginning in the early centuries of the church. These became popular \nduring the Middle Ages. These tales were collected in books of \nhagiography such as the Golden Legend or the works of Caesarius of \nHeisterbach. These miracle tales made relics much sought-after during \nthe Middle Ages. By the late Middle Ages the collecting of, and \ndealing in, relics had reached enormous proportions, and had spread \nfrom the church to royalty, and then to the nobility and merchant \nclasses. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Trent of 1563 enjoined bishops to instruct their \nflocks that \"the holy bodies of holy martyrs ... are to be venerated \nby the faithful, for through these [bodies] many benefits are \nbestowed by God on men\". The council further insisted that \"in the \ninvocation of saints, the veneration of relics and the sacred use of \nimages, every superstition shall be removed and all filthy lucre \nabolished.\"[18] There are also many relics attributed to Jesus, \nperhaps most famously the Shroud of Turin, said to be the burial \nshroud of Jesus Christ.\u0014",

    "words": "Barb Brisson\u0014\nMay 13, 2015\u0014\n\u0014\nAs she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of \nschool, she told the children an untruth. Like most teachers, she \nlooked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. \nHowever, that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped \nin his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he \ndid not play well with the other children, that his clothes were \nmessy and that he constantly needed a bath. In addition, Teddy could \nbe unpleasant.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight \nin marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then \nputting a big \"F\" at the top of his papers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review \neach child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. \nHowever, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.\u0014\n\u0014\nTeddy's first grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is a bright child with a \nready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners... he is a \njoy to be around..\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis second grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is an excellent student, well \nliked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a \nterminal illness and life at home must be a struggle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis third grade teacher wrote, \"His mother's death has been hard on \nhim. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much \ninterest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't \ntaken.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTeddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't \nshow much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he \nsometimes sleeps in class.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of \nherself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas \npresents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for \nTeddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper \nThat he got from a grocery bag Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in \nthe middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to \nlaugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones \nmissing, and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume.. But she \nstifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the \nbracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her \nwrist. Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough \nto say, \"Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to.\" \nAfter the children left, she cried for at least an hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that very day, she quit teaching reading, writing and arithmetic. \nInstead, she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson paid particular \nattention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come \nalive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the \nend of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the \nclass and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the \nsame, Teddy became one of her \"teacher's pets..\"\u0014\nA year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling* \nher that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then \nwrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she \nwas still the best teacher he ever had in life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years after that, she got another letter, saying that while \nthings had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with \nit, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. \nHe assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite \nteacher he had ever had in his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he \nexplained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a \nlittle further. The letter explained that she was still the best and \nfavorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little \nlonger.... The letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story does not end there. You see, there was yet another letter \nthat spring. Teddy said he had met this girl and was going to be \nmarried. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago \nand he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit at the \nwedding in the place that was usually reserved for the mother of the \ngroom.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? She wore that bracelet, \nthe one with several rhinestones missing. Moreover, she made sure she \nwas wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on \ntheir last Christmas together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson's \near, \"Thank you Mrs. Thompson for* believing in me. Thank you so much \nfor making me feel important and showing me that I could make a \ndifference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, \n\"Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I \ncould make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(For you that don't know, Teddy Stoddard is the Dr. at Iowa Methodist \nHospital in Des Moines that has the Stoddard Cancer Wing.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWarm someone's heart today. . . pass this along. I love this story so \nvery much, I cry every time I read it. Just try to make a difference \nin someone's life today? tomorrow? Just \"do it\".\u0014\n\u0014\nRandom acts of kindness, I think they call it.\u0014",

    "words": "Remembering Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus' heart was full. He wished his friend Marcianus could be \nwith him so that they could talk about Christ, but that was \nimpossible. So he picked up his pen. They might be separated by \ndistance but a letter could capture his feelings. He dipped the quill \nin ink and began to write:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Knowing, my beloved Marcianus, your desire to walk in godliness, \nwhich alone leads man to life eternal, I rejoice with you and make my \nprayer that you may preserve your faith entire and so be pleasing to \nGod who made you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus wrote many things, not only to Marcianus, but to others. \nThese writings are of the utmost importance, for they show the state \nof Christianity in the second century after Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse teaching (heresy) had gained destructive power. In another \nlengthy writing, Irenaeus listed these and gave Christian answers to \ntheir false claims. One of his arguments was that only the universal \nchurch had the truth which it had passed from bishop to bishop. \nIrenaeus was in a strong position when making this claim. He had \npersonally known Polycarp, the martyred bishop from Asia Minor who in \nturn had known St. John and other apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne heresy of the day that Irenaeus took the trouble to answer was \nGnosticism. Gnosticism claimed that one needed a special, hidden \nknowledge if one's soul was to be saved. Irenaeus must have had this \nin mind when he wrote Marcianus:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This then is the order of the rule of our faith, and the foundation \nof the building, and the stability of our conversation: God, the \nFather, not made, not material, invisible; one God, the creator of \nall things: this is the first point of our faith. The second point \nis: The Word of God, Son of God, Christ Jesus our Lord...And the \nthird point is: The Holy Spirit, through whom the prophets \nprophesied, and the fathers learned the things of God, and the \nrighteous were led forth into the way of righteousness; and who in \nthe end of the times was poured out in a new way upon mankind in all \nthe earth, renewing man unto God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And for this reason the baptism of our regeneration proceeds through \nthese three points: God the Father bestowing on us regeneration \nthrough His Son by the Holy Spirit. For as many as carry (in them) \nthe Spirit of God are led to the Word, that is to the Son; and the \nSon brings them to the Father; and the Father causes them to possess \nincorruption.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIrenaeus became a leader in the church in Lyons, France. In 177, the \nLyons' leadership sent him to Rome with a message. While he was away, \nheathen authorities arrested his bishop and many other Christians and \nkilled them as martyrs in the arena in a savage spectacle. These \nincluded Blandina, one of history's best known martyr women.\u0014\n\u0014\nIreneaus' writings powerfully declared that the true church had the \ntruth because it had Scripture on its side as well as sound reason, \nthe guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the memories of those who had \nknown the apostles. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis feast is on this day, June 28. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n1.Aland, Kurt.

    "words": "Rene Goupil Tomahawked\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nRen Goupil longed to serve God as a Jesuit. When ill health forced \nhim to drop out of training at Paris, he volunteered to serve in \nCanada as a layman. For two years he did the dirty work at his new \nhome. Among his duties was to care for patients at the local \nhospital, where he demonstrated surgical ability. That led to him \nbeing sent to assist a Jesuit mission to the Hurons as a surgeon.\u0014\n\u0014\nRen traveled inland with the Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues, another \nlayman William Couture and a party of Hurons. The great enemies of \nthe Hurons were the Iroquois. A company of Iroquois ambushed the \nHurons. Ren was captured. Isaac Jogues, who had gotten away into the \nbrush, gave himself up to the Iroquois so he could pastor Ren and \nthe Hurons in their peril. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Indians fell on the Frenchmen and Hurons with dreadful savagery, \ntearing off their fingernails, beating them and biting through their \nfingers.as, \"Father [Jogues], may God be praised; He has allowed \nthis, He has wished it. May His holy will be done: I love it, I will \nit, I cherish and embrace it with all my heart.\" And he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nExposed to mosquitoes day and night and forced to carry heavy loads, \nhe staggered on as a prisoner for days. Whenever he reached an Indian \nvillage, he was forced to run the gauntlet. In the villages, he was \ntortured. In spite of his own wounds, he tended the sick whenever he \ncould. Isaac Jogues suffered the same misery and showed the same \nkindness to his enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt every opportunity, Ren instructed the Indians in the Christian \nfaith. He prayed constantly. At one point he said to Jogues, \"Father, \nGod has always given me an intense desire of consecrating myself to \nHis service by religious vows in the Society of Jesus. Heretofore, my \nsins have always rendered me unworthy of this grace. Nevertheless I \nhope that our Lord will find acceptable the offering which I wish to \nmake to Him now by pronouncing, as best I can, the vows of the \nSociety, in the presence of my God and before you.\" Jogues readily \nagreed to this and Ren became a Jesuit.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter weeks of torment, Ren was sick but still unbroken. On this \nday, September 29, 1642, he made the sign of the cross over some \nIroquois children. Their grandfather saw it and believed Ren was \nbewitching them. Shortly afterward, as Ren and Isaac Jogues walked \nin the woods by the Indian village, praying together, two Indian \nwarriors joined them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, one swung his tomahawk and struck Ren a blow into the \nskull. Gasping out the name of Jesus one last time, Ren fell. \nBelieving that his own time had come, Jogues knelt in prayer, ready \nto take a similar blow. He was not killed, however. The next day, he \nwent out to bury Ren's body. Animals had already torn it. The best \nhe could do was to sink it in a stream with stones. Later the Indians \ndumped it into a ravine.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdopted by the Indians, Isaac Jogues survived to tell Ren's tale. \nAfter escaping, he returned to mission work, was captured a second \ntime and killed by another Iroquois warrior.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nJogues, Isaac. \"Rene Goupil 16O8-1642.\" \nhttp://www.wyandot.org/goupil.htm\u0014\n\"Goupil, Ren.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "title": "REFORMATIONS THEN AND NOW",
    "words": "The saints have no extra credits: Reformations then and now\u0014\nOpinion Bill Leonard  |  October 21, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn All Hallows Eve (AKA Halloween), 1517, an Augustinian monk and \nprofessor named Martin Luther posted Ninety-five Theses on the church \ndoor of the Castle Church in the eastern German town of Wittenberg. \nThe door supposedly served as the bulletin board for the University \nof Wittenberg where Luther taught Bible. The theses included Luthers \nraging invective against the local manifestation of a churchwide \natrocity: the selling of indulgences.\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslated from Latin into German and circulated through a new social \nmedium, the printing press, the Ninety-five Theses sparked the \nProtestant Reformation, elements of which remain 502 years later.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes (indulgences) are simply a means of excusing behavior \nthats a long way from saintliness, resources we use to fool \nourselves into thinking were holy when were not.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndulgence selling was a medieval plan of salvation vested in papal \nauthority by which sinners could benefit from the merits of the \nsaints, a storehouse of Gods grace so abundant in the holiest \nChristians that it was more than enough for their salvation. In order \nthat such leftover grace not go to waste, God had given the Vicar of \nChrist authority to bestow it on less saintly Christians who could \nthen utilize such merit for themselves, their relatives, or friends. \nAll for a little cash.\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially, indulgences were dispensed to assure salvation for \ncrusaders fighting to retake the Holy Land from the Turks (nothing \nchanges). The practice was later expanded to those who, unable to \nmake crusade, would contribute funds to its support. Purchasers were \nrequired to make the appropriate contrition, confession and \nsatisfaction for their sins, yet over time that small print was \ngenerally ignored by populace and priest alike. Cash alone was \nsufficient.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndulgences thus became an ecclesiastical cash cow. Sixteenth-century \npopes the likes of Julius II and Leo X issued plenary (full) \nindulgences to secure funds for building great cathedrals, including \nSt. Peters Basilica in Rome. Toward that purpose, Leo X granted a \nplenary indulgence to Luthers Archbishop who hired the indulgence \nseller Johann Tetzel to preach (and peddle) the sale.\u0014\n\u0014\nTetzels sermons often included this bit of pious doggerel:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the coin in the coffer rings,\u0014\nThe soul from purgatory springs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd concluded: Will you not then for a quarter of a florin receive \nthese letters of indulgence through which you are able to lead a \ndivine and immortal soul into the fatherland of paradise?\u0014\n\u0014\nLong an opponent of indulgences, Luthers rage burned hot at their \npromotion in his territory. His theses denounced them as false \npromises of cheap grace and corrupt theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nPapal indulgences do not remove guilt, he wrote. Beware of those \nwho say that indulgences effect reconciliation with God. The saints \nhave no extra credits  If the pope does have the power to release \nanyone from purgatory, why in the name of love does he not abolish \npurgatory by letting everyone out?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe saints have no extra credits. Ive read those words repeatedly \nacross the years, but this October they came home with a vengeance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my view, United States Attorney General William Barr sold \nindulgences this October.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther used them to condemn a church that turned the merits of the \nSaints, personified in lives of holiness and self-sacrifice, into \ntawdry cash payments that let sinners off the gospel hook. Today, \nthe saints have no extra credits reminds us that indulgences didnt \nend with the Reformation; were all in danger of going Tetzel \nbefore we know it. Indulgences arent always cash cows. Sometimes \nthey are simply a means of excusing behavior thats a long way from \nsaintliness, resources we use to fool ourselves into thinking were \nholy when were not.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid 19th-century white southern Christians market the doctrine of \nbiblical infallibility as an indulgence by appealing to certain \nscripture passages as a means of excusing their support for chattel \nslavery? Richard Furman made that point in 1822, writing that in \nproving this subject [slavery] justifiable by Scriptural authority, \nits morality is also proven; for the Divine Law never sanctions \nimmoral actions. He concluded: If a man has obtained slaves by \npurchase, or inheritance, and the holding of them as such is \njustifiable by the law of God; why should he be required to liberate \nthem?\u0014\n\u0014\nAbolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass cut \nthrough those indulgence-like claims, repudiating biblical extra \ncredit for slaveholders. Garrison, editor of the antislavery \nperiodical, The Public Liberator, challenged evangelicals who sent \nout missionaries but ignored slavery, writing: Let anti-slavery \ncharity boxes stand uppermost among those for missionary, tract and \neducational purposes. On this subject, Christians have been asleep; \nlet them shake off their slumbers and arm for the holy contest.\u0014\nDouglass, himself a former slave, asserted: For of all slaveholders \nwith whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I \nhave ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and \ncowardly, of all others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose two prophets called the church to a new Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA hundred years later, Martin Luther King Jr. raised similar \nReformation prospects in response to Jim Crow legislation, \nsegregation and white supremacy. In one of his most profound \nwritings, Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963), King confronted a \ngroup of Birmingham moderate clergy, Christian and Jewish, who, \nthough well meaning, were peddling the indulgence of injustice in the \nname of law and order and common sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe saints have no extra credits. Ive read those words repeatedly \nacross the years, but this October they came home with a vengeance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Birmingham ministers written statement acknowledged that recent \npublic events have given indication that we all have opportunity for \na new constructive and realistic approach to racial problems. \nHowever, we are now confronted by a series of demonstrations by some \nof our Negro citizens, directed and led in part by outsiders. We \nrecognize the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes \nare slow in being realized. But we are convinced that these \ndemonstrations are unwise and untimely.\u0014\nKing reminded the ministers that he was in Birmingham because he had \nbeen invited by Civil Rights leaders because injustice is here and \nbecause injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. He \ninsisted: Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, \nprovincial outside agitator idea.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing confessed his grave disappointment with the white moderate, \nwhich led him to the regrettable conclusion that the Negros great \nstumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White \nCitizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who \nis more devoted to order than to justice. Even the indulgence of \norder could not excuse inaction against injustice and radical \nreformation.\u0014",

Practically nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nMen got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water.  Breakfast \nis strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., \nbut kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie \nand other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by \nthe two city boys that live on coffee. Their food,  plus yours,  \nholds you until noon when you get fed again. It's no wonder these \ncity boys can't walk much.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe go on 'route marches,' which the platoon sergeant says are long \nwalks to harden us.  If he thinks so, it's not my place to tell him \ndifferent.  A 'route march' is about as far as to our mailbox at \nhome. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sergeant is like a school teacher.  He nags a lot.  The Captain \nis like the school board.

I don't know why..  The bulls-eye is near as \nbig as a chipmunk head and don't move, and it ain't shooting at you \nlike the Higgett boys at home.  All you got to do is lie there all \ncomfortable and hit it.  You don't even load your own cartridges They \ncome in boxes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training.  You get to \nwrestle with them city boys I have to be real careful though, they \nbreak real easy.  It ain't like trying to castrate them young bulls \nat home.  I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug \nJordan from over in Fort Ashby. I only beat him once...  He joined up \nthe same time as me, but I'm only 5'6' and 130 pounds and he's 6' 6\" \nand near 300 pounds dry.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers \nget onto this setup and come stampeding in.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nYour loving daughter,\u0014\n  Alice\u0014",

For hundreds of years the word \n\"repent\" had been construed to mean \"do penance and feel miserable \nabout it.\"  Young Luther certainly did more than his share of penance \nand felt more miserable about it than almost anyone. Said Luther: \"I \nkept the rules of penance so strictly that I many say that if ever a \nmonk got to heaven by his sheer monkery, it was I.  Had I kept on any \nlonger, I should have killed myself with vigils, prayers, readings, \nand other works.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Luther's astounding discovery was that \"repent\" did not really \nmean to do penance but rather, as the Greek METANOIA indicates, to \nchange your mind, to think again or in a new way, to look at \neverything differently.  He noted also that when Jesus used the word, \nit was always linked with belief:  repent and believe.  Repenting and \nbelieving, however, are not two distinct steps to take, one after the \nother.  They are two aspects of a single process.  To repent is, in \neffect, to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Illustrations for Preaching\" by Clyde Chesnutt. Clergy Journal, \nFeb 1991.  Page 39.\u0014",

He hadn't been running for several \nmonths.  He watched John Landy run the mile under four minutes.  He \nwent up to Coach Percy Cerutty, one of the best coaches in Australia, \nand said, 'Mr. Cerutty, I want to run the mile in less than four \nminutes.'\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Cerutty looked at him and said, 'Son, do you know what it takes \nto run a mile under four minutes?  Do you know what it is to run \nuntil you can hardly stand up, to suck in hot air until you're almost \nunconscious?  Do you know what it is to run that kind of race?'\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Elliott said, 'I don't care what it takes; I want to run the \nmile under four minutes.'\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"The coach said, 'OK, come out to the track tomorrow.'  But \nCerutty didn't put him on the track; he took him out to a beach \nnearby, ran him uphill on the sand, and ran him over boulders and \nrocks.  He ran him over the most difficult obstacle course he could \nfind.  The kid kept running; he wouldn't give up.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Less than one year later, 20-year-old Elliott ran the mile in \n3:54.5, smashing the world record.

Mr. Berry was a jewel thief.  It got so \nthat his visits became a sort of status symbol among the upper-class \nladies around town.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But during one of his nocturnal visitations, the police caught up \nwith Berry and shot him.

After his release he \ntook up residence in a quiet New England town and led the life of a \nrespectable citizen.  Eventually when word got out that the famous \njewel thief was living in this small New England town, reporters \nconverged on his house seeking interviews.  One reporter came up with \nthis question:  \"Mr. Berry, you stole from a lot of different rich \npeople, but who did you steal the most from?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Berry didn't even have to stop and think about his answer.  He \nsaid, \"That's the easiest question I have ever been asked.  The \nindividual from who I stole the most was a man named Arthur Berry.  I \ncould have done anything, been an executive on Wall Street, a \nsuccessful businessman, or anything I wanted to be, but I took my \nGod-given talents and developed them illegitimately.  I could have \nmade it big in business, but I spent two-thirds of my life behind \nbars.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [The Preacher's Magazine, Sep-Nov 1997.  Page 51.]\u0014",
