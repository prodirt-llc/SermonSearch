Perception -- The responsibility of the speaker or writer is \nto ensure that the listener relations the communication to his/her \nown experiences.  Unless the hearer perceives the communicators' \nmeaning, there is no communication.\u0014\n      2. Expectation -- Be aware of the expectations of their \npeople.  Listen to them.\u0014\n      3. Demand -- Communication places demands on the hearer.  \nCommunication that does not fit with the audience's values is usually \nrejected.\u0014\n      4. Interdependence -- Perception and information are \ninterdependent elements of good communication.\u0014",

    "words": "The following was written by State Representative Mitchell Kaye \nfrom GA.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help \neveryone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more \nriots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure \nthe blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our\u0014\ngreat-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain \nand establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, \nguilt-ridden, delusional, and other liberal, bedwetters. \u0014\n\u0014\n We hold these truths to be self-evident: that a whole lot of people \nare confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a \nBill of No Rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV or \nany other form of wealth.  More power to you if you can legally \nacquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE II: You do not have the right never to be offended.  This \ncountry is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone - \nnot just you!  You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a \ndifferent opinion, etc., but  the world is full of idiots, and\u0014\nprobably always will be.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm.  If you \nstick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful.  Do not \nexpect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives \nindependently wealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing. \nAmericans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly \nhelp anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing \ngeneration after generation of professional couch potatoes who \nachieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of \nprofessional couch potatoes.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care.  That would \nbe nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not \ninterested in public health care.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE VI: You do not have the right physically to harm other \npeople. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, \ndon't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the \nelectric chair.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others. \nIf you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other \ncitizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock \nyou away in a place where you still won't have the right\u0014\nto a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE VIII: You don't have the right to demand that our children \nrisk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We \nhate oppressive governments, and won't lift a finger to stop you from \ngoing to fight, if you'd like. However, we do not enjoy\u0014\nparenting the entire world.  We do not want to spend so much of our \ntime battling every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny \nhat.\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE IX: You don't have the right to a job. All of us sure want \nall of you to have one, and will gladly help you along in hard times, \nbut we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education \nand vocational training laid before you to make yourself\u0014\nuseful.\u0014\n\u0014\nand,\u0014\n\u0014\nARTICLE X: You do not have the right to happiness.  Being an American \nmeans that you have the right to pursue happiness - which by the way, \nis a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over-abundance of \nidiotic laws created by those of you who were confused\u0014\nby the Bill of Rights.\"\u0014",

Finally he showed me  her copy \nof the memo, with her demand that I be fired -- and the word \n\"pedagogical\" circled in red.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up \nin his dictionary, and made a copy of the definition to send back to \nher, he told\u0014\nme not to worry. He would take care of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later a memo to the entire staff came out --\u0014\ndirecting us that no words which could not be found in the local \nSunday newspaper could be used in company memos.\u0014\n\u0014\nA month later I resigned. In accordance with company policy, I \ncreated my resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday \npaper.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. This gem is the closing paragraph of a nationally circulated memo \nfrom a large communications company:\u0014\n\u0014\n \"(Company name) is endeavorily determined to promote constant \nattention on current procedures of transacting business focusing \nemphasis on innovative ways to better, if not supersede, the \nexpectations of quality!\"\u0014",

The lowest price is $9 a \ngallon,\u0014\nand we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: What's the difference in the paint?\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you \nintend\u0014\nto use it?\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9\u0014\nversion?\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree \nto\u0014\nstart painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until \nat\u0014\nleast Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: You've got to be kidding!\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Sir, we don't kid around here.

You\u0014\nhave shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It \nmay\u0014\nbe the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any\u0014\ngiven weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: You mean the price went up while we were talking!\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of \ntimes\u0014\na day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with \nyour\u0014\npaint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing \nto happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. \nHow many gallons do you want?\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy\u0014\nsix gallons just to make sure I have enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then\u0014\ndon't use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible \nconfiscation of\u0014\nthe paint you already have.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: What?\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen,\u0014\nbathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you \ndo\u0014\nthe bedroom, you will be in violation of our tariffs.\u0014\n\u0014\nCustomer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? \nI\u0014\nalready paid you for it!\u0014\n\u0014\nClerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it\u0014\nis.

    "title": "BE CAREFUL ABOUT JUDGING PEOPLE",
    "words": "On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of \nquarters at a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for \ndinner with her husband in the hotel dining room. But first she \nwanted to stash the quarters in her room.  \"I'll be right back and \nwe'll go to eat,\" she told her husband and she carried the coin-laden \nbucket to the elevator.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men \nalready aboard.  Both were black.  One of them was big ... very big \n... an intimidating figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: \nThese two are going to rob me.  Her next thought was: Don't be a \nbigot, they\u0014\nlook like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are \npowerful, and fear immobilized her.  She stood and stared at the two \nmen. She felt anxious, flustered, ashamed. She hoped they didn't read \nher mind, but knew they surely did; her hesitation about joining them \non the elevator was all too obvious.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a mighty \neffort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and \nfollowed with the other foot and was on the elevator.  Avoiding eye \ncontact, she turned around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as \nthey closed.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second passed, and then another second, and then another.  Her fear \nincreased!  The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she \nthought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed!\u0014\n\u0014\nHer heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore.   \nThen....one of the men said, \"Hit the floor,\"  Instinct told her: Do \nwhat they tell you.  The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw \nout her arms and collapsed on the elevator carpet. A shower of coins \nrained down on her.  Take my money and spare me, she prayed. More \nseconds passed.  She heard one of the men say politely, \"Ma'am, if \nyou'll just tell us what floor you're going to, we'll push the \nbutton,\" The one\u0014\nwho said it had a little trouble getting the words out.  He was \ntrying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. She lifted her head and \nlooked up at the two men.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey reached down to help her up.  Confused, she struggled to her \nfeet.  \"When I told my man here to hit the floor,\" said the average \nsized one, \"I meant that he should hit the elevator button for our \nfloor.  I didn't mean for you to hit the floor, ma'am.\"  He spoke \ngenially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was having a hard time \nnot laughing.  She thought:  My God, what a spectacle I've made of \nmyself. She was too humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an \napology, but words failed her.  How do you apologize to two perfectly \nrespectable gentlemen for behaving as\u0014\nthough they were going to rob you?  She didn't know what to say.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her \nbucket.   When the elevator arrived at her floor they insisted on \nwalking her to her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, \nand they were afraid she might not make it down the corridor.  At her \ndoor they bid her a good evening. As she slipped into her room she \ncould hear them roaring with laughter while they walked back to the \nelevator.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman brushed herself off. She pulled herself together and went \ndownstairs for dinner with her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning flowers were delivered to her room-a dozen roses.  \nAttached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card \nsaid:  \"Thanks for the best laugh we've had in years.\"\u0014\nIt was signed,  Eddie Murphy and Michael Jordan.\u0014\n___\u0014",

Now for those of you who could care less\u0014\nabout football stick with me for just a minute. Bill Parcells\u0014\nwas one of those coaches, that as a player, you either hated or\u0014\nyou hated. I mean the guy was nothing short of ill-tempered and\u0014\ndifficult to please. He even told a player who was sick the flu,if \nyou will pardon the expression, \"to throw-up on his own time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFor all his bad qualities there was something to like. He got the job \ndone. He lead the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles and the \nNew England Patriots to an AFC crown before\u0014\njoining the Jets in 1997. He took the Jets from laughingstock to \ncontender, going 9-7, 12-4 (losing in the conference title game)and \n8-8 this season. A season which included some of his best work in \nspite of being ravaged by injuries and losing several close games \nearly.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust this week. At the end of the season. Coach Bill Parcells looked \ninto the mirror and discovered he couldn't go on. Monday night, as he \nstood with his players, he told them he was resigning as coach. He \nread to them this poem:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you get what you want in your struggle for Self\u0014\nAnd the world makes you king for a day\u0014\nJust go to the mirror and look at yourself\u0014\nAnd see what \"the man\" has to say\u0014\n\u0014\nFor it isn't your parents, your children, or wife\u0014\nWhose judgment upon you must pass\u0014\nThe Fellow whose verdict counts most in your life\u0014\nIs the one staring back from the Glass\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people may think you a straight-shooting chum\u0014\nAnd call you a wonderful guy\u0014\nBut the Man in the Glass says you're only a bum\u0014\nIf you can't look him straight in the eye\u0014\n\u0014\nHe's the fellow to please, NEVER MIND THE REST\u0014\nFor he's with you clear up to the end\u0014\nAnd you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test\u0014\nIf the Man in the Glass is your friend\u0014\n\u0014\nYou may fool the whole world down the pathway of Life\u0014\nAnd get pats on the back as you pass\u0014\nBut your final reward will be heartaches and tears\u0014\nIf you've cheated the Man in the Glass.\u0014",

Detectives recovered a knife and a \nbaseball bat believed to be the weapons, Glover said.\u0014\nThe sheriff said Joshua had confessed but the boys lawyer, Richard \nNichols, refused to label the statement a confession. He gave them a \nstatement about what happened, Nichols said.\u0014\nAuthorities had not yet decided whether to charge him as an adult. \nThe boy, who has no criminal record, would not be eligible for the \ndeath penalty because of his age.\u0014\nJoshua appeared in court today, wearing ankle and wrist shackles. He \ndid not speak during the two-minute hearing and Nichols did not enter \na plea.\u0014\nDuval County Judge James Ruth ordered the boy held under tight \nsecurity in isolation at a juvenile detention center.

She saw a liquid oozing from the bed Tuesday. When she pulled \naside the frame, she saw Maddies feet and summoned an officer \npatrolling the neighborhood, Glover said.\u0014\nHer body was securely entombed in the casement of that water bed, \nhe said.\u0014\nInvestigators believe the girl was killed in the house shortly after \nshe vanished. The boys parents were away at the time, the sheriff \nsaid.\u0014\nGlover said Maddie did not appear to have been sexually assaulted.\u0014\nThere was no indication she had any reason to be afraid or had any \napprehension to go with him, he added. \u0014\nHe Was Always a Good Kid\u0014\nSam Ilardi, who lives next to Joshua and allowed his 8-year-old son \nto play with the boy, said he never suspected Joshua could be \ninvolved.\u0014\nHe was a good kid.

I noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but \nclean\u0014\nhungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas. I paid for \nmy\u0014\npotatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas. I am a\u0014\npushover for creamed peas and new potatoes. Pondering the peas, I\u0014\ncouldn't help overhearing the conversation between Brother Miller and \nthe ragged\u0014\nboy next to me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hello Barry, how are you today?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"H'lo, Mr. Miller. Fine, thank ya. Jus' admirin' them peas......sure\u0014\nlook good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They are good, Barry. How's your Ma?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fine.

Do you have a red one like this at home?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not 'zackley .....but, almost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Tell you what. Take this sack of peas home with you and next trip\u0014\nthis way let me look at that red marble.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sure will. Thanks, Mr. Miller.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me. With \na\u0014\nsmile she said: \"There are two other boys like him in our community, \nall\u0014\nthree are in very poor circumstances. Jim just loves to bargain with\u0014\nthem for peas, apples, tomatoes or whatever. When they come back with \ntheir\u0014\nred marbles, and they always do, he decides he doesn't like red after \nall\u0014\nand he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an\u0014\norange one, perhaps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI left the stand, smiling to myself, impressed with this man. A short\u0014\ntime later I moved to Utah but I never forgot the story of this man, \nthe\u0014\nboys and their bartering. Several years went by each more rapid than \nthe\u0014\nprevious one. Just recently I had occasion to visit some old friends \nin\u0014\nthat Idaho community and while I was there learned that Brother Miller\u0014\nhad died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends \nwanted\u0014\nto go, I agreed to accompany them. Upon our arrival at the mortuary we\u0014\nfell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer \nwhatever\u0014\nwords of comfort we could. Ahead of us in line were three young men. \nOne\u0014\nwas in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark \nsuits and\u0014\nwhite shirts...very professional looking.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey approached Mrs. Miller, standing smiling and composed, by her\u0014\nhusband's casket. Each of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the\u0014\ncheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket.

    "title": "BROTHER MILLER'S ROADSIDE STAND",
    "words": "During the waning years of the depression in a small South eastern \nIdaho community, I used to stop by Brother Miller's roadside stand \nfor farm-fresh produce as the season made it available.\u0014\n\u0014\nFood and money were still extremely scarce and bartering was used, \nextensively.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne particular day Brother Miller was bagging some early potatoes for \nme. I noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but \nclean hungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas. I \npaid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green \npeas. I am a\u0014\npushover for creamed peas and new potatoes. Pondering the peas, I \ncouldn't help overhearing the conversation between Brother Miller and \nthe ragged boy next to me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hello Barry, how are you today?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"H'lo, Mr. Miller. Fine, thank ya. Jus' admirin' them peas......sure \nlook good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They are good, Barry. How's your Ma?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fine. Gittin' stronger alla' time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Good. Anything I can help you with?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, Sir. Jus' admirin' them peas.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Would you like to take some home?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, Sir. Got nuthin' to pay for 'em with.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, what have you to trade me for some of those peas?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"All I got's my prize marble here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is that right? Let me see it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Here 'tis. She's a dandy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can see that. Hmmmm, only thing is this one is blue and I sort of \ngo for red. Do you have a red one like this at home?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not 'zackley .....but, almost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Tell you what. Take this sack of peas home with you and next trip \nthis way let me look at that red marble.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sure will. Thanks, Mr. Miller.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me. With \na smile she said: \"There are two other boys like him in our \ncommunity,all three are in very poor circumstances. Jim just loves to \nbargain with them for peas, apples, tomatoes or whatever. When they \ncome back with their red marbles, and they always do, he decides he \ndoesn't like red after all and\u0014\nhe sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an \norange one, perhaps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI left the stand, smiling to myself, impressed with this man. A short \ntime later I moved to Utah but I never forgot the story of this man, \nthe boys and their bartering. Several years went by each more rapid \nthan the previous one. Just recently I had occasion to visit some old \nfriends in that Idaho community and while I was there learned that \nBrother Miller\u0014\nhad died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends \nwanted to go, I agreed to accompany them. Upon our arrival at the \nmortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and \nto offer whatever words of comfort we could. Ahead of us in line were \nthree young men. One was\u0014\nin an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark suits \nand white shirts...very professional looking.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey approached Mrs. Miller, standing smiling and composed, by her \nhusband's casket. Each of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the \ncheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket. Her misty \nlight blue eyes followed them as, one by one, each young man stopped \nbriefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the \ncasket. Each left the mortuary, awkwardly, wiping his eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur turn came to meet Mrs. Miller. I told her who I was and mentioned \nthe story she had told me about the marbles. Eyes glistening she took \nmy hand and led me to the casket.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Those three young men, that just left, were the boys I told you \nabout.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey just told me how they appreciated the things Jim 'traded' them. \nNow, at last, when Jim could not change his mind about color or \nsize...they came to pay their debt.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world,\" she\u0014\nconfided,\"but, right now, Jim would consider himself the richest man \nin Idaho.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her \ndeceased husband. Resting underneath were three, magnificently shiny, \nred marbles.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoral: We will not be remembered by our words, but by our kind deeds.\u0014",

The evening \nbefore Ellerbeck\u0014\n  was shot, Linda Jankelow, a woman in her mid-40s, left her home in \nCozy Close, a\u0014\n  secluded cul-de-sac in a wealthy suburb, to walk two doors away to \nattend a\u0014\n  neighborhood crime prevention meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Moments later she was shot several times.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Her head was split open like a burst watermelon,\" a neighbor told \nthe Johannesburg\u0014\n  Star newspaper on Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\n  She remained in a critical and unstable condition in a Johannesburg \nclinic on Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The residents of Cozy Close, a neighborhood of about 16 homes which \nhas suffered\u0014\n  10 crimes since January including break-ins and hijackings, say \nthey are too scared to\u0014\n  go outside.\u0014\n\u0014\n  South Africa's police force has launched a national crime crackdown \nand its elite\u0014\n  Scorpions unit is prowling the streets.

    "title": "BUDDHISM AND JESUS",
    "words": "The life stories of Jesus and the Buddha are strikingly similar. \u0014\nBoth are conceived without sexual intercourse and born to chaste \u0014\nwomen. [That matter is highly debated by some authorities.] Both \nleave home for the wilderness where each is tempted by a Satan \nfigure. Both return enlightened, work miracles and challenge the \nreligious establishment by their teachings. Both \u0014\nattract disciples and both are betrayed by one of them. Both preach \u0014\ncompassion, unselfishness and altruism and each creates a movement \u0014\nthat bears the founder's name. \u0014\n\u0014\nA contemporary Buddhist monk that has a large following here in the \u0014\nUnited States and in Europe sees Jesus and Buddha as \"brothers\" who \u0014\ntaught that the highest form of universal understanding is \u0014\nuniversal love. The similarities are between the two are striking \u0014\nand would be all the more so had they been contemporaries. But the \u0014\nman who started the Buddhist movement, Gautama Buddha, lived in the \u0014\n6th century (BC), was born into a noble family on the borders of \nIndia \u0014\nand Nepal, grew up as a Hindu, rejected certain tenants of his \u0014\nnative faith, and more than likely fashioned his own experiences. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe teachings of this man are summed up in what is reported to be \u0014\nhis very first sermon to his followers. He made four points [and I \u0014\nwould suggest that this is where he went wrong he should have kept \u0014\nit to three points (sorry had to inject some humor here)] and these \u0014\npoints are called the Four Noble Truths: 1. that sorrow is the \u0014\nuniversal experience of mankind 2. that the cause of sorrow is \u0014\ndesire, and the cycle of rebirths (reincarnation) is perpetuated by \u0014\ndesire for existence 3. that the removal of sorrow can only come \u0014\nfrom the removal of desire 4. that desire can be systematically \u0014\nabandoned by following the Noble Eight fold path. And, with the \u0014\ncessation of desire humans pass from this world of individual \u0014\nexistence into the world of pure Being (Nirvana). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe striking difference in the two religions is this: It is the \u0014\ngoal of every Buddhist to achieve Buddhahood, to become Buddha \u0014\nhimself, to achieve Nirvana. In Christianity a Christian can never \u0014\nbecome Christ nor should we ever try. It would be heresy to even \u0014\nbegin down such a road. Not to mention the fallacy in trying to \u0014\nescapee this individualistic life. What the Buddhist does to the \u0014\nChrist figure is strip him of his divinity, make him into a mere \u0014\nman, and transform him into a figure like Buddha. It is common, in \u0014\nBuddhist circles to regard Jesus as an emanation, a partial and \u0014\ninferior copy, a \"truth body\" [dharmakaya] they would say, of the \u0014\nBuddha. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Dalai Lama, who resides in India, and is a kind of \"Pope\" \u0014\nfigure for Buddhist is viewed as the vice-regent of the Buddha and \u0014\nthe reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama. He says that Christ \u0014\nwas either a fully enlightened being or achieved a very high \u0014\nspiritual realization.\u0014\n\u0014\nAS REPORTED IN \"NEWSWEEK\" MAGAZINE.\u0014",

JOHANN GUTENBERG\u0014\n  \u0014\nI'm sure there is hardly a person reading this letter who wouldn't \nargue with either the individual selections or the order in which \nthey are placed. I certainly have my quarrels with some of them. Can \nyou believe Margaret Sangeran undisputed racist and inspiration for \nthe modern abortion movementwas ranked number 50, ahead of Winston \nChurchill, Franklin Roosevelt, Benjamin Franklin and Jonas Salk? \nDwight D. Eisenhower, who led the Allies to victory in the greatest \nstruggle against tyranny in world history, didn't even make the cut! \nAnd how about Princess Diana making the list, but Queen Victoria, who \ninfluenced the entire Western world for decades, was completely \nignored? It is also disappointing, but not surprising I suppose, that \nthere were very few religious leaders designated. Passed over were \nDr. Billy Graham, Pope John Paul II, John Calvin, William \nWilberforce, William Booth, John Wesley, Dwight L. Moody, John Knox, \nDavid Livingstone and Hudson Taylor. Surely one or more of these \ninfluential men should have made the grade at some level. Oh well, \nwho ever said that life was fair?\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite my disagreements with some of the people named above, I am in \ncomplete accord with A&E's selection of the top gun. When all was \nsaid and done, Johann Gutenberg was proclaimed to be the most \ninfluential person of the past 1,000 years. His impact cannot be \nunderestimated. Gutenberg's invention of the moveable-type printing \npress in the middle of the fifteenth century changed society forever. \nThe Church Net UK News Service says that the printing method \n[Gutenberg] gave the world was the sole means of mass communication \nfor centuries and remained largely unchanged right through until the \ntwentieth century.2 While many of the individuals on A&E's list are \neither scientists, religious leaders or powerful politicians, \nGutenberg was a simple, hard-working German who was by no means a \ngenius, either by today's standards or those of the fifteenth century \nworld in which he lived. Nevertheless, most of the people who have \ndramatically impacted our world in the last 1,000 yearsfrom John \nLocke to Thomas Jefferson, Louis Pasteur to Adolf Hitlerare in \nGutenberg's debt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe invention of the printing press completely changed the way \ninformation could be shared and disseminated, signaling a dramatic \nshift from the isolated, city-state mentality of European monarchies \nto the interactive global culture that we recognize today. \nGutenberg's invention helped fuel some of the most important social \nand cultural changes that were to come, including the Reformation, \nthe Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. It also \norchestrated the creation of the middle class, as the free flow of \ninformation between common men and women gave power to the people and \nstruck a fatal blow to the absolute rule of the elite. Echoes of this \nshift are certainly evident in the democratic form of government that \nwe in North America enjoy today.\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg probably didn't realize at the time that his invention \nwould, either directly or indirectly, play a role in the toppling of \nkingdoms and the empowerment of the common people. Instead, he was \ndriven by a mission that was far simpler but had positively eternal \nramifications. Johann Gutenberg wanted to make the word of God \navailable to everyone and, in so doing, share the good news of Christ \nwith people all over the world. No mortal man ever set out to \naccomplish such a noble purpose for the cause of Christianity. \nSeveral quotes from Gutenberg reflect this passion. Consider the \nfollowing:\u0014\n\u0014\nGod suffers in the multitude of souls whom His holy word cannot \nreach. Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of manuscript \nbooks, which confine instead of spreading the public treasure. Let us \nbreak the seal which seals up holy things, and give wings to truth, \nin order that she may go and win every soul that comes into this \nworld, by her word, no longer written at great expense by a hand \neasily palsied, but multiplied like the wind by an untiring machine.3\u0014\n\u0014\nGutenberg also saw eternal potential in the invention itself:\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall soon flow \nin inexhaustible streams, the most abundant and most marvellous \nliquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of men! Through it, \nGod will spread His word. A spring of pure truth shall flow from it; \nlike a new star it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause \na light heretofore unknown to shine amongst men.4\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fruit of Gutenberg's labor was a three-volume, Latin version of \nthe Holy Scriptures. Completed in Mainz in 1455, the Gutenberg Bible \n(also known as the 42-Line Bible or the Mazarin Bible) was the first \nbook to have been printed using metal moveable type. It is not known \nhow many of the Bibles were printed (many historians believe there \nwere about 200). Only 47 copies survive today, most of them worn and \ntattered. Only three perfect copies are known to exist, one of \nwhich can be found in the Library of Congress.5\u0014\n\u0014\nSurely, Christians today should be mindful of the way the Lord used a \nhumble man in Mainz, Germany, to help spread the good news to every \nnation on earth. You and I owe our knowledge of God's word to the \nwork of his hands. Gutenberg's contributions can be seen in the \ncountless translations of Scripture that are now available around the \nworld, as well as in the many mediumsTV, radio, magazines, e-mail, \naudio and video tapes, films and the Internetthrough which the \ngospel is preached.\u0014\n\t\t\t\t\t\u0014\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObservation of James Dobson\u0014",

    "words": "BURNING CROSSES IN \nCYBERSPACE\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than 130 years, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has provided a model \nfor extremists by actively practicing and promoting bigotiy \nintimidation and violence. In the 1990s, Klan members remain active \nand violent, planning terrorist bombings and burning Black churches. \nIn April 1997, three Klan members were arrested in a plot to blow up \na natural gas refinery near Fort Worth, Texas. \u0014\n\u0014\nThree more men with links to the Klan were arrested in February 1~18 \nfOr planning to poison water supplies, rob banks, plant bombs, and \ncommit assassinations. In a July 1998 court judgment, the Christian \nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan, its South Carolina state leader Horace \nKing, and several other Klansmen were held responsible for their \nroles in a conspiracy to burn down a Black church.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike other white supremacist groups, the Klan has turned to the \nInternet as a means to revitalize their movement and attract a new \ncadre of supporters and activists. Up until last month, the Knights \nof the Ku Klux Klan Realm of Florida was very small, writes Brian K. \nBass of his Klan group. But now we have a website up, and our \nnumbers are growing dramatically. We picked up 6 new members in just \nthe last two weeks, and have other applications under consideration. \nI feel that this is due to the website.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Klans on the Web represent different factions and espouse \nvarious viewpoints, their Web sites are formatted in similar ways. \nMost Klan sites contain a membership application, a list of upcoming \nrallies, a statement of principles, an explanation of customs (such \nas cross burning), and a spurious account of Klan history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, some Klan sites link to other Klan sites with which they \nare not affiliated. For instance, the North Georgia White Knights Web \nsite links to many chapters of the Knights of the White Kamellia, the \nNew Order Knights, and the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The site for \nAmerica's Invisible Empire links to the Web pages of the Northwest \nWhite Knights and Knights of the White Kamellia, among others. Such \nlinks, as well as the similarities between KKK sites, demonstrate the \nbonds among the different Klan factions, despite their infighting.\u0014\nAlso common to many Klan Web sites is advocacy of Identity, a \npseudo-theology that claims to be a form of Christianity, but is in \nreality a hateful mixture of anti-Semitism, racism, and homophobia. \nIdentity holds that Jews are the offspring of Satan; that Blacks and \nother racial minorities are inferior; and that white AngloSaxons are \nthe true Israelites.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2000 Anti-Defamation League\u0014\n823 United Nations Plaza New York, NY 10017 www.adl.org\u0014\nThe Ku Klux Klan\u0014",

In the early 1800s, Elizabeth \nFry worried about the\u0014\n                          opposite-and for good reason. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          England's prisons were infamous for filth, \nbrutality, and extreme\u0014\n                          suffering. The idea was to punish not to \nreform prisoners. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          In the women's division, where Fry would \ndirect her greatest\u0014\n                          reform efforts, inmates were usually \ncrammed into one room: those\u0014\n                          tried and those awaiting trial, those \nguilty of misdemeanors and\u0014\n                          those guilty of capital offenses. Typically \na woman's children would\u0014\n                          accompany her to prison. Thus a woman who, \nwith her children,\u0014\n                          awaited her trial for stealing an apple \nlived in the same crammed\u0014\n                          space as a woman who may have been \nconvicted of murder. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          All basic human activities-eating, \nsleeping, defecation-were\u0014\n                          performed in the same confined area. Women \nand children lived in\u0014\n                          destitute poverty and obtained clothes, \nalcohol, even food by\u0014\n                          begging or stealing. Many women simply sat \naround in a drunken\u0014\n                          stupor stark naked. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Most prisoners who were not cared for by \nfamilies or charities\u0014\n                          remained clothesless or starved to death. \nChildren often remained\u0014\n                          in the prison until their mothers died or \nwere executed. They clung\u0014\n                          to their mothers and watched as they were \nled to the gallows and\u0014\n                          hung. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Elizabeth Fry was one of the few who sought \nto do something\u0014\n                          about all this. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Render them peaceable\u0014\n                          Fry was born Elizabeth Gurney, daughter of \na wealthy Norwich\u0014\n                          banker. When she was 18, she heard a sermon \nby American\u0014\n                          Quaker William Savery, and she rededicated \nher life to Christ and\u0014\n                          became a Quaker. In 1800 she married Joseph \nFry, and she\u0014\n                          eventually raised eleven children. Family \nresponsibilities, however,\u0014\n                          did not dampen her conviction, inspired by \nher faith, that she was\u0014\n                          called to help the downtrodden. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          During her life, Fry worked with the \nhomeless and helped establish\u0014\n                          a school for nurses. But her greatest \nlegacy was prison reform, and\u0014\n                          she began that work with almost daily \nvisits to Newgate prison\u0014\n                          beginning in 1811. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          In 1816 she founded a women's society, An \nAssociation for the\u0014\n                          Improvement of the Female Prisoners in \nNewgate. Its object was\u0014\n                          \"to provide for the clothing, instruction, \nand employment of the\u0014\n                          women; to introduce them to a knowledge of \nthe Scriptures; and to\u0014\n                          form in them, as much as possible, these \nhabits of sobriety, order\u0014\n                          and industry, which may render them docile \nand peaceable whilst in\u0014\n                          prison, and respectable when they leave \nit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Fry had six reform goals: \u0014\n\u0014\n                          1. Women should be under the care and guard \nof other women. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          2. Little communication should be allowed \nbetween inmates, and\u0014\n                          then only at specified times to instill \ndiscipline and to discourage\u0014\n                          women teaching each other how to commit \ncrimes once they were\u0014\n                          released. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          3. Inmates should not have to depend on \nfamily or friends for food\u0014\n                          or clothing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          4. Inmates should work and be paid for it, \nthe earnings going\u0014\n                          toward their support. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          5. Women should work and eat together but \nhave some privacy\u0014\n                          and sleep separately. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          6. Religious instruction should permeate \nall efforts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Fry spent countless hours inside prison \nbars-in spite of the many\u0014\n                          warnings she was given about the danger. \nShe taught women how\u0014\n                          to sew and quilt and how better to care for \nthemselves and their\u0014\n                          children. She read the Scriptures daily to \ninmates and obtained\u0014\n                          Bibles for those who wanted them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Fry also introduced education, discipline, \nand Bible instruction into\u0014\n                          the half-way houses released women would \nenter before they\u0014\n                          found jobs and fully re-entered society. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Dignitaries flock\u0014\n                          Her efforts produced what seemed like a \nmiracle: orderly,\u0014\n                          disciplined inmates who became known for \ntheir work ethic. So\u0014\n                          remarkable was the change at Newgate that \nlocal mayors, sheriffs,\u0014\n                          and aldermen visited Newgate and sought \nsimilar reform in their\u0014\n                          jails and prisons. Public interest was so \naroused, Fry was invited to\u0014\n                          tell both the queen and the House of \nCommons about her work. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Her reform ideas spread. Dignitaries from \nall over Europe visited\u0014\n                          Newgate prison, and she was invited by many \nEuropean\u0014\n                          governments to promote prison reform. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Danny Day is a freelance writer from Dixon, \nIllinois. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Copyright(c) 1997 by Christianity Today, \nInc/Christian\u0014\n                          History Magazine. \u0014\n                          Issue 53, Vol. XVI, No. 1, Page 38\u0014",

    "words": "Britney Spears Taken To Task For \"Spiritual \nInconsistency\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       ELIZABETHTOWN, PA (CHARISMA) -- She may be the biggest act in \nmusic at the\u0014\n       moment, but Britney Spears isn't No. 1 with the Center for \nParent/Youth Understanding\u0014\n       (CPYU). As the 18-year-old stages a sold-out world tour, the \nChristian parent-teen\u0014\n       organization has warned that the singer is sending out all the \nwrong messages. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Although she talks about her Baptist faith and nightly \nprayers, Spears' \"verbalized\u0014\n       commitment doesn't mesh with the sexual messages of her visual \nimage,\" says the\u0014\n       CPYU in an essay addressing \"The 'Spiritual Inconsistency' of \nBritney Spears.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       The Pennsylvania-based group, which helps churches and \ncommunity groups support\u0014\n       families through the challenges of adolescence, issued a \ntwo-part analysis because of\u0014\n       the singer's massive following among young girls and \nwidespread acceptance by\u0014\n       many parents for the lack of overtly sexual content to her \nsongs. \u0014\n\u0014\n       But the former \"Mickey Mouse Club\" member who sang \"Jesus \nLoves Me\" at the\u0014\n       audition that won her recording contract presents \"a confusing \npostmodern mix of\u0014\n       spirituality and teasing, schoolgirl sexuality,\" and \n\"apparently sees little inconsistency\u0014\n       between her faith and her view of sexuality,\" says the CPYU. \u0014\n\u0014\n       While acknowledging the talent that has racked up more than 12 \nmillion U.S. sales of\u0014\n       her first album, \"Baby One More Time,\" and 5 million of the \nfollow-up, \"Oops...I Did It\u0014\n       Again,\" since its release in May, the organization questions \nwhether Spears' music is\u0014\n       \"nothing but innocent fun,\" and suggests that parents, \neducators and youth workers\u0014\n       should be concerned about her \"music, image and influence.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       The article cites Spears' reaction to criticism for seductive \nposes in a \"Rolling Stone\"\u0014\n       magazine photo shoot--which she dismissed as harmless--as \nindicative of her mixed\u0014\n       messages. It says that her music is \"laced with subjectivity,\" \nwith the songs about love\u0014\n       celebrating feelings above all else. \u0014\n\u0014\n       But while Spears is \"a relatively simple and innocent \nperformer\" whom few parents\u0014\n       would prevent their children from listening to \"when music \nstores are stacked with\u0014\n       CDs...sporting 'parental advisory' stickers,\" the CPYU says \nthat adults should learn\u0014\n       some important lessons from the teen sensation. \u0014\n\u0014\n       For her music can play \"a powerful role in shaping the world \nand life view\" of children,\u0014\n       and also provide an opportunity to talk about emotional and \nrelational issues. More\u0014\n       importantly, the Spears phenomenon should drive parents to try \nto understand the\u0014\n       impact of postmodernity on young people. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Spears' defining marks are also those of the postmodern world, \nsays the CPYU.\u0014\n       \"First, she emphasizes feelings as the authority for \ndetermining right and wrong in all\u0014\n       matters. Outside authority is denied, and the self becomes \nsovereign. \u0014\n\u0014\n       \"And second, Spears' feeling-oriented self has determined that \nthere is no\u0014\n       inconsistency between speaking out about her Christian faith \nwhile immodestly\u0014\n       celebrating her sexuality in an ungodly manner...conversations \nwith most Christian\u0014\n       kids indicate they are moving in the same direction. It's an \nissue we must face,\u0014\n       understand and address.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       The essay in the CPYU quarterly newsletter says that young \npeople need to be\u0014\n       warned about the dangers of relying upon emotions and that \n\"life in a fallen and sinful\u0014\n       world often does not 'feel good.'\" And her popularity and \n\"postmodern brand of\u0014\n       spirituality should serve as a catalyst to aggressive youth \nministry that promotes the\u0014\n       integration of faith into all of life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n        2000, Charisma News Service\u0014\n\u0014\n       (Post date: July 20, 2000)\u0014",

He exuded physical toughness in \npart to combat\u0014\n                   classmates who teased him because he stuttered. \"I \nwas the John Gotti of\u0014\n                   my neighborhood,\" he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   But he wasnt as tough as his mother, who \nthreatened him with reform\u0014\n                   school after he and friends stoned several pigs to \ndeath at a nearby farm.\u0014\n                   By junior high school, however, Jackson had \ndecided to channel his energy\u0014\n                   into athletics. At McAdory High, he lettered in \nthree sports and won two\u0014\n                   state decathlon titles. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   An Alabama football assistant coach unwittingly \nsteered Jackson to\u0014\n                   Auburn by telling him, \"If you go there, youll \nnever beat Alabama.\" This,\u0014\n                   plus the promise of immediate playing time, sold \nhim on the Tigers. As a\u0014\n                   freshman in 1982, he scored the winning touchdown \nagainst the Crimson\u0014\n                   Tide to snap a decade- long losing streak. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   That win began Auburns renaissance, as the Tigers \nwent 11-1 behind\u0014\n                   Jacksons 1,213 yards rushing in 1983. A separated \nshoulder sidelined\u0014\n                   him for six games the next fall, but Jackson \nrecovered ahead of schedule to\u0014\n                   help Auburn finish 9- 4. In the spring, he played \ncenterfield for the baseball\u0014\n                   team, batting .401 with 17 homers and 55 runs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   He bolted from the gate his senior year as the \nclear Heisman favorite and\u0014\n                   collected 495 yards and six touchdowns in two \ngames. Auburn hit No. 1 in\u0014\n                   the polls, but losses to Tennessee in September \nand Florida in November\u0014\n                   knocked the Tigers from SEC contention. In both \ngames, Jackson left\u0014\n                   early with leg injuries, but he steeled himself \nfor the seasons stretch run.\u0014\n                   He played his final regular-season game with two \ncracked ribsan injury\u0014\n                   he tried to hide from Dye and still bulled his \nway to 142 yards and two\u0014\n                   scores against Alabama. \"Bo ran as tough as any \nback youll ever see,\"\u0014\n                   recalls Dye, who found out about the ribs two days \nbefore the game and\u0014\n                   outfitted his star in a flak jacket. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Jackson finished the fall with a school-record \n1,786 yards and 17\u0014\n                   touchdowns, and a career average of 6.6 yards per \ncarry. That dominance\u0014\n                   won over Heisman votersbarely. He edged Iowa \nquarterback Chuck\u0014\n                   Long by 45 points, the smallest margin ever. \"Its \nlike being in an elite\u0014\n                   fraternity,\" he says of the trophy, which he keeps \nin his suburban Chicago\u0014\n                   home. \"I was chosen out of thousands of athletes \nto get in that club.

In his fifth game, he \nsprinted into NFL lore with a\u0014\n                   221-yard, three-touchdown Monday Night Football \ngame against Seattle,\u0014\n                   including a breathtaking 91-yard TD run. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   From there he became an icon: the 1989 baseball \nAll-Star Game MVP (he\u0014\n                   homered and stole a base), a football Pro Bowler \nthe next year, a\u0014\n                   pitchman whose \"Bo Knows\" Nike commercials were \npop-culture\u0014\n                   classics. But a January 1991 hip injury in an NFL \nplayoff game ended his\u0014\n                   days with the Raiders and Royals. After undergoing \nhip replacement\u0014\n                   surgery, he played a few more baseball seasons \nwith the White Sox and\u0014\n                   Angels, but his extraordinary speed and power were \ngone. He retired in\u0014\n                   1995. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Now Jackson, 37, enjoys a peaceful life with wife \nLinda and their three\u0014\n                   children. He has a stake in two businesses: Gamer \nEnterprises, a nutritional\u0014\n                   foods distributor, and Jackson Pro Management, a \nfinancial services\u0014\n                   company. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   For a man accustomed to fame, his absence from the \npublic eye might\u0014\n                   seem surprising. But he learned early in life \nnever to take the predictable\u0014\n                   path. These days Bo knows contentment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   -- Alec Morrison\u0014",

Located just outside of Tampa Bay, the\u0014\n            city boasts palm trees, white beaches, sun, surf,\u0014\n            and six cruise tour companies with \"dolphin\u0014\n            sightings guaranteed.\" Liberally supplied with\u0014\n            spacious hotels within driving distance of the\u0014\n            Busch Gardens amusement park and the\u0014\n            Salvador Dali museum, Clearwater is a tidy burg\u0014\n            with street names like Gulf to Bay Boulevard and\u0014\n            Sunset Point Road.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Clearwater is also home to the most prestigious\u0014\n            international instructional center for the Church\u0014\n            of Scientology, one of the most controversial and\u0014\n            aggressive new religions worldwide. In the past\u0014\n            25 years, the growth of Scientology in\u0014\n            Clearwater has transformed the city's downtown\u0014\n            corridor, reshaped its religious climate, and\u0014\n            caused Christian churches to rethink their\u0014\n            response to religions that proclaim an unbiblical\u0014\n            message. \u0014\n\u0014\n            In 1975 Scientology owned two of the major\u0014\n            buildings in downtown Clearwater. Now the\u0014\n            Church of Scientology boasts 30, including a\u0014\n            newly constructed center that will expand its\u0014\n            ability to train new members by 400 percent.\u0014\n            Scientology's influence is felt in city planning,\u0014\n            community events, and service projects; many\u0014\n            Clearwater Christians are stunned by how\u0014\n            Scientology is redefining their community. To\u0014\n            reach out with cultural sensitivity, the Church of\u0014\n            Scientology employs many methods Christians\u0014\n            have used over the centuries: showing\u0014\n            compassion for the vulnerable and striving to be\u0014\n            a model corporate citizen. But individuals and\u0014\n            organizations tell stories of having been harassed,\u0014\n            threatened, or sued. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Some Christians in Clearwater call Scientology a\u0014\n            pushy, money-driven cult that preys on the\u0014\n            vulnerable. Others avoid confrontation, striving\u0014\n            to tolerate or even welcome Scientology as a\u0014\n            member of the religious community. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Bill Anderson, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church\u0014\n            of Clearwater for the past 25 years, says it has\u0014\n            been difficult to treat Scientologists with love\u0014\n            while countering their teachings with biblical\u0014\n            truth. \"This has really sharpened my focus about\u0014\n            the exclusivity of the gospel,\" Anderson told\u0014\n            Christianity Today. \"Part of my challenge as a\u0014\n            pastor has been trying to help my people live not\u0014\n            only as good people but to live as good\u0014\n            witnesses. Too often, I'm afraid, Christians are\u0014\n            afraid to stand on the fact that only Jesus can\u0014\n            save you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            After years of aloofness, several prominent\u0014\n            Clearwater churches are recommitting\u0014\n            themselves to work side by side in neighborhood\u0014\n            evangelism to reach the entire community,\u0014\n            including the Church of Scientology. As\u0014\n            Scientology expands internationally, Clearwater's\u0014\n            Christians hope that what they have learned from\u0014\n            dealing with Scientology will help other\u0014\n            Christians worldwide. \u0014\n\u0014\n            False religion?\u0014\n            J. Gordon Melton, a leading scholar of\u0014\n            contemporary religious movements, says\u0014\n            Scientology differs from many alternative\u0014\n            religions because Scientologists aim to utterly\u0014\n            remake the world instead of taking refuge from\u0014\n            it. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Unlike the Mormons [in the late 19th century]\u0014\n            who only wanted to be left alone, Scientologists\u0014\n            want to participate in culture,\" Melton says.\u0014\n            \"They have inherited a perspective from the\u0014\n            1960s social activists.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologists have made persistent and\u0014\n            persuasive efforts to win the favor of key officials\u0014\n            and municipal leaders in Clearwater. When\u0014\n            downtown Clearwater was in decline in the\u0014\n            1970s, the Church of Scientology bought real\u0014\n            estate, investing millions of dollars in its\u0014\n            properties. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientology members clean vacant lots, plant sea\u0014\n            oats to stop beach erosion, and hang holiday\u0014\n            decorations in December. They led volunteer\u0014\n            citizen councils to prepare the city for Y2K and\u0014\n            created their own Boy Scout and Girl Scout\u0014\n            troops. Scientologists hold annual parties for\u0014\n            local orphans, support anti-drug education in\u0014\n            community schools, and sponsor Winter\u0014\n            Wonderland, a children's carnival, every\u0014\n            Christmas season. \u0014\n\u0014\n            The Church of Scientology also opens some of\u0014\n            its facilities, including the historic Fort Harrison\u0014\n            Hotel's ballroom, to Clearwater residents and\u0014\n            organizations. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"One of the concepts of Scientology is that you\u0014\n            can't just survive and achieve happiness and\u0014\n            spiritual understanding for yourself,\" Mike\u0014\n            Rinder, director of the Church of Scientology\u0014\n            International, told CT in an lengthy interview in\u0014\n            Clearwater. \"You also have a responsibility for\u0014\n            the groups that you're a part of, the community\u0014\n            you live in, the people you deal with, your\u0014\n            neighbors, and a general responsibility for all\u0014\n            mankind.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Rinder's statement hints at what Scientology\u0014\n            holds out to spiritual seekers. Scientology: \u0014\n\u0014\n             Aims to unleash the godlike potential of each\u0014\n            person's immortal soul. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Values both science and spirituality. Religion\u0014\n            schol ar Frank K. Flinn has called Scientology\u0014\n            technological Buddhism. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Supports environmental causes and healthy\u0014\n            living. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Entrusts women, minorities, and young people\u0014\n            with key leadership roles. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Promises that members will accumulate power\u0014\n            and position as they advance in training. \u0014\n\u0014\n             Retains a hip aura. Film stars John Travolta\u0014\n            and Tom Cruise are in the small but influential\u0014\n            group of celebrities who publicly embrace\u0014\n            Scientology. \u0014\n\u0014\n            In Scientology's early years, religion scholars\u0014\n            considered it either a cult or a false religion.\u0014\n            Contemporary scholars, who are less likely to\u0014\n            use judgmental terms, call it a \"new religious\u0014\n            movement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Beneath the pop appeal and carefully\u0014\n            constructed image lies a central conviction of\u0014\n            Scientology: individuals are to be loyal to\u0014\n            Scientology first and foremost. Scientologists\u0014\n            determine what is ethical based on whether the\u0014\n            action in question contributes to Scientology's\u0014\n            survival. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologist author Regis Dericquebourg\u0014\n            describes this ethical yardstick in Scientology, a\u0014\n            reference work distributed by the Church of\u0014\n            Scientology International: \"The morality of an\u0014\n            individual is judged with regard to the actions he\u0014\n            accomplishes for survival. In such a perspective,\u0014\n            goodness is what is constructive, badness what\u0014\n            is against survival. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Scientology ethics are not a set of\u0014\n            recommendations. They are the result of an\u0014\n            understanding and interiorization of the meaning\u0014\n            of life, which acts as a personal compass. It\u0014\n            would be an open moral system.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            The cost of withdrawal\u0014\n            When Scientology arrived in Clearwater, it tried\u0014\n            to participate in the community. But several\u0014\n            congregations, determined to avoid\u0014\n            Scientologists, stopped interacting with anyone\u0014\n            outside of their immediate church community. \u0014\n\u0014\n            At the Upper Pinellas County Ministerial\u0014\n            Alliance, Bill Anderson and many other pastors\u0014\n            grew weary of bickering about whether\u0014\n            Scientologists could join the council. Anderson\u0014\n            says he left the association because the repeated\u0014\n            Scientology debates prevented members from\u0014\n            accomplishing the alliance's goals. Many\u0014\n            Christian congregations followed this same\u0014\n            pattern; they retreated to their safe sanctuaries\u0014\n            and grew extremely wary of ecumenical\u0014\n            activities. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"As a pastor, I'm regularly asked to accept them\u0014\n            as local clergy,\" says Rick Foster of Clearwater\u0014\n            Community Church. \"I get lots of invitations to\u0014\n            Scientology's charitable outreach events. I don't\u0014\n            attend because I don't want to legitimize them as\u0014\n            spiritual leaders in the community.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"There is a healthy sense of wanting to maintain a\u0014\n            distance from them, because if you tick them off,\u0014\n            then they are going to come after you full blast,\"\u0014\n            Foster adds. \"Once you arouse them, they have\u0014\n            no love or charity on their partwhich is kind of\u0014\n            a good thing, because Jesus said his followers\u0014\n            would be known for their love.. You tell\u0014\n            people to watch their methods, and people pick\u0014\n            up on their aggression pretty readily.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Outchurching the church\u0014\n            Scientologists say they were welcomed by some\u0014\n            religious leaders, including Otis and Barbara\u0014\n            Green of Everybody's Tabernacle, the rabbinic\u0014\n            leaders of Congregation of Beth Shalom, and the\u0014\n            United Church of Christ's hospice director,\u0014\n            Doyce Wise. Largely unwelcome in most of\u0014\n            Clearwater's religious circles, Scientologists\u0014\n            created their own interfaith council and launched\u0014\n            ministry projects for the community.\u0014\n            Scientologists also actively engaged in\u0014\n            community service, outchurching Clearwater's\u0014\n            Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\n            But some residents question their desire to serve.\u0014\n            \"Their true agenda is control,\" Anderson says.\u0014\n            \"They don't really want to be known. They want\u0014\n            to get along like a tiger wants to get along with a\u0014\n            rabbit. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"A lot of their community projects are modeled\u0014\n            after what Christians have been doing here all\u0014\n            along,\" Anderson says, listing Calvary Baptist's\u0014\n            prison ministry, children's programs, and special\u0014\n            events. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Ben Puckett, dean of enrollment at Clearwater\u0014\n            Christian College, agrees but adds that some\u0014\n            Scientology outreach in Clearwater is not openly\u0014\n            affiliated with the church. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"They have a great deal of good-will programs\u0014\n            that are so general and euphemistic that unless\u0014\n            you ask, you wouldn't know they are\u0014\n            Scientology-run,\" Puckett says, citing Narcanon,\u0014\n            Crimanon, and the True School, a Scientology\u0014\n            elementary school, as examples. \"Some things\u0014\n            they are very public about and others they keep\u0014\n            quiet for fear of community disapproval.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            The importance of appearing earnest\u0014\n            The Church of Scientology presents an\u0014\n            empathic, caring persona to outsiders. But some\u0014\n            Christian leaders see that as a mirage. \"The\u0014\n            church is very intentional about its pr and its\u0014\n            image in the community,\" says Ron Benefiel, a\u0014\n            former Nazarene pastor who dealt with\u0014\n            Scientologists in Los Angeles for two decades. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologists burnish their public image,\u0014\n            associating the movement with tradition,\u0014\n            structure, and credibility. Not only did they\u0014\n            purchase a historic hotel for their headquarters,\u0014\n            but the design for the new training building and\u0014\n            auditorium echoes the hotel's mission-style\u0014\n            architecture. The distinctive uniforms worn by\u0014\n            Scientology staff project an image of trustworthy\u0014\n            authority. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Many Scientology ceremonies and symbols\u0014\n            seem patterned after familiar Christian traditions.\u0014\n            A key symbol, displayed on the covers of\u0014\n            pamphlets, books, and even the roofs of many\u0014\n            church buildings, is an eight-point cross that\u0014\n            represents Scientology's eight dynamics: self,\u0014\n            family, groups, species, life forms, physical\u0014\n            universe, spirits, and infinity. \u0014\n\u0014\n            The church is also experimenting with weekly\u0014\n            Sunday services to introduce newcomers to\u0014\n            Scientology. Sermons, group exercises, and\u0014\n            instructions about seating arrangements all\u0014\n            appear in The Background Ministry,\u0014\n            Ceremonies, and Sermons of the Scientology\u0014\n            Religion. The book gives directions for five\u0014\n            different types of Scientology weddings, two\u0014\n            funeral ceremonies, and even a christening\u0014\n            service that opens with the minister placing a\u0014\n            drop of water on the baby's forehead. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologists do not believe in a personal God\u0014\n            but rather in an Infinity (\"the All-ness of All\").\u0014\n            Their formal prayer for total freedom, recited at\u0014\n            meetings, includes the words \"Freedom to be.\u0014\n            Freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom\u0014\n            to use and understand man's potentiala\u0014\n            potential that is God-given and godlike.\" The\u0014\n            prayer ends with \"May God let it be so.\"\u0014\n            Scientology official Mike Rinder says that prayer\u0014\n            expresses Scientology's vision for a new world;\u0014\n            it is not a petition to a personal God. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"In Scientology the concept of God is really\u0014\n            infinity, not a person that we pray to in the\u0014\n            traditional sense,\" Rinder says. He adds that the\u0014\n            cross and the Sunday meetings are not imitations\u0014\n            of Christian practice. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientology has its own symbols, style, and\u0014\n            practices, he says; for example, each individual\u0014\n            attends Scientology courses and undergoes\u0014\n            \"auditing\"one of Scientology's most distinctive\u0014\n            practices. During auditing, individuals are\u0014\n            electrically monitored with a polygraph-like\u0014\n            device as they recall crucial moments in their\u0014\n            lives, hoping to free themselves from harmful\u0014\n            feelings and reactions. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologists believe their church has been\u0014\n            maligned and stigmatized. Although their church\u0014\n            has fought and won the legal battle for legitimacy\u0014\n            in the United States, Scientologists say they still\u0014\n            are subjected to prejudice and bias in other\u0014\n            nations around the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n            But others say the Church of Scientology has\u0014\n            only itself to blame. Calvary Baptist's Anderson\u0014\n            told CT that Scientology's lack of candor is\u0014\n            longstanding. Anderson says an organization\u0014\n            known as United Churches of Florida\u0014\n            approached him in the 1970s and offered free\u0014\n            radio time. After Anderson started asking\u0014\n            questions, the individuals acknowledged they\u0014\n            worked for the Church of Scientology. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"My problem with them from the beginning has\u0014\n            been that they did not tell the truth about\u0014\n            themselves,\" Anderson says. \"They came into\u0014\n            Clearwater under the shade of night, and they\u0014\n            have systematically attempted to take over this\u0014\n            town.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientologists told CT they never tried to\u0014\n            deceive Clearwater. \"It is common practice for\u0014\n            any large and influential organization about to\u0014\n            establish itself in a new area to remain discreet\u0014\n            until details of the move are final,\" says\u0014\n            Scientology official Janet Weiland of Los\u0014\n            Angeles. She compared Scientology's purchases\u0014\n            in Clearwater to Disney's acquisition of Florida\u0014\n            land for its theme parks. \u0014\n\u0014\n            As for United Churches of Florida, Weiland says\u0014\n            it was a group launched by Scientology to unite\u0014\n            members of all faiths in solving social problems.\u0014\n            Scientology disbanded the group was disbanded\u0014\n            because it was \"misunderstood and distorted by\u0014\n            ill-minded religious isolationists.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Civic tensions\u0014\n            As the Church of Scientology expanded its\u0014\n            Clearwater instructional arm, the Flag Service\u0014\n            Organization, mistrust intensified between local\u0014\n            residents and Scientologists. The church's\u0014\n            attempts to discredit local opponents heightened\u0014\n            tensions. According to evidence uncovered by\u0014\n            the fbi and reported in The Washington Post,\u0014\n            Mayor Gabe Cazares was subjected to a 1978\u0014\n            smear campaign and was implicated in a\u0014\n            hit-and-run auto accident allegedly staged by\u0014\n            Scientologists. Cazares today considers the\u0014\n            church an \"international paramilitary terrorist\u0014\n            organization.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Relations between the city and Scientology\u0014\n            remained fractious during the 1990s. When\u0014\n            Brian Aungst was elected last year, he was the\u0014\n            first Clearwater mayor in a dozen years to\u0014\n            welcome dialogue with Scientology officials. His\u0014\n            opponent, former mayor Rita Garvey, says she\u0014\n            made it a habit never to speak with church\u0014\n            authorities. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Suspicions about the Church of Scientology's\u0014\n            true intentions for Clearwater have been around\u0014\n            at least since 1977. That year fbi agents raided\u0014\n            Scientology offices in Los Angeles and\u0014\n            Washington, D.C., uncovering plans to take over\u0014\n            parts of the federal government as well as\u0014\n            controlling Clearwater. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientology officials claimed the plans were\u0014\n            those of a rogue group within the church\u0014\n            infrastructure that included Mary Sue Hubbard,\u0014\n            the widow of founder L. Ron Hubbard. \u0014\n\u0014\n            The Scientology Guardian's Office group illegally\u0014\n            wiretapped several federal agencies, including\u0014\n            the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a perennial\u0014\n            Scientology foe. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Eleven church members were convicted in 1979\u0014\n            of stealing government documents to cover up\u0014\n            church activities. \u0014\n\u0014\n            As Scientology fought to be recognized as a\u0014\n            church, reports surfaced about practices\u0014\n            involving extrasensory perception and beliefs\u0014\n            about alien life. \u0014\n\u0014\n            At that time, the IRS said Scientology was not a\u0014\n            religion because members paid fees to attend\u0014\n            courses and auditing sessions. The IRS refused\u0014\n            to grant the Church of Scientology tax-exempt\u0014\n            status until 1993. By then, after almost 40 years\u0014\n            of lawsuits, the organization reportedly was\u0014\n            spending $1.5 million per month in legal fees. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Legal wrangling\u0014\n            Scientology has earned a reputation for pursuing\u0014\n            legal action against its critics. \"We do everything\u0014\n            within our power to keep cases from going to\u0014\n            court,\" Rinder told CT, with the caveat that if\u0014\n            negotiations fail, then Scientology will do what it\u0014\n            takes to ensure victory. \"We don't seek out\u0014\n            fights, but if forced into one, we'll give it\u0014\n            everything we've got.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            But in some of Scientology's most prominent\u0014\n            court battles, the out-of-court negotiations have\u0014\n            raised questions about Scientology's methods. \u0014\n\u0014\n            For example, after years of Scientology's legal\u0014\n            wrangling with the IRS, the U.S. Supreme Court\u0014\n            handed down a decision in 1989 (Hernandez v.\u0014\n            Commissioner of Internal Revenue) that the\u0014\n            payments Scientology collected for training and\u0014\n            auditing sessions were not tax deductible and\u0014\n            could not be classified as charitable\u0014\n            contributions. Undeterred, Scientologists\u0014\n            responded with more than 2,000 individual\u0014\n            lawsuits against the IRS. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Critics believed the church was employing a\u0014\n            tactic founder Hubbard outlined in a 1955\u0014\n            magazine article: \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The law can be used very easily to\u0014\n                 harass and discourage, rather than\u0014\n                 to win. and enough harassment\u0014\n                 on somebody who is simply on the\u0014\n                 thin edge anyway  will generally\u0014\n                 be sufficient to cause his\u0014\n                 professional decease. If possible,\u0014\n                 of course, ruin him utterly.\u0014\n\u0014\n            David Miscavige, chairman of the board of\u0014\n            Scientology's Religious Technology Center,\u0014\n            decided to meet with IRS officials in 1991. He\u0014\n            visited the Washington offices of then-IRS\u0014\n            Commissioner Fred Goldberg and negotiated a\u0014\n            two-year review process that ended with an\u0014\n            out-of-court settlement. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Under the settlement, Scientology would receive\u0014\n            tax-exempt status if it paid $12 million in back\u0014\n            taxes (compared to $33 million for legal\u0014\n            expenses in 1988, according to the St.\u0014\n            Petersburg Times). \u0014\n\u0014\n            The suits by individual Scientologists were\u0014\n            withdrawn. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Critics also raise concerns about the death of\u0014\n            Scientologist Lisa McPherson in 1995.\u0014\n            McPherson died in the care of Clearwater\u0014\n            Scientologists 17 days after a car accident left\u0014\n            her exhibiting signs of mental illness. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Medical examiner Joan Wood changed her\u0014\n            assessment of what caused McPherson's death\u0014\n            from \"undetermined\" to \"accident\" in February\u0014\n            2000. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Scientology officials had urged the examiner to\u0014\n            review her findings for four years. Scientology\u0014\n            officials and lawyers compiled mounds of\u0014\n            information for Wood's review, including\u0014\n            investigative studies on ketone (an organic\u0014\n            compound) and an elaborate reconstruction of\u0014\n            the accident. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Rinder told the St. Petersburg Times that\u0014\n            although the money spent on the case was\u0014\n            \"enormous,\" the church believed it was\u0014\n            necessary to supply Wood with \"the correct\u0014\n            information.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Local prosecutors later dropped criminal\u0014\n            charges against the church. Although the state\u0014\n            has more or less closed the McPherson case, the\u0014\n            woman's estate is proceeding with a wrongful\u0014\n            death suit against the church. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Brave new city\u0014\n            In spite of strained relations, Scientology\u0014\n            appears destined to become Clearwater's most\u0014\n            conspicuous corporate citizen. The past 25 years\u0014\n            stand as a social experiment in which a new\u0014\n            religion is remaking an existing city in its own\u0014\n            image. \u0014\n\u0014\n            With great tenacity, the Church of Scientology\u0014\n            has become heavily involved in a community that\u0014\n            simmered with hostility at its approach. Instead\u0014\n            of shunning Scientology, some city officials now\u0014\n            see it as a fixture in Clearwater and able to\u0014\n            contribute to the city's growth and prosperity. \u0014\n\u0014\n            As legal cases have been resolved, a new era of\u0014\n            cooperation between city leaders and the church\u0014\n            seems to be unfolding, says William B. Horne II,\u0014\n            Clearwater's assistant city manager. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Our new vision for the city is 'One city, One\u0014\n            future,' \" Horne says. \"It reflects our confidence\u0014\n            that all members of the community have a stake\u0014\n            in making this the best city to live and vacation\u0014\n            in.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Horne's immediate predecessor, Bob Keller,\u0014\n            called the Church of Scientology an economic\u0014\n            asset because it draws people with expendable\u0014\n            income to the area. Scientology has helped the\u0014\n            city council embrace this view by sponsoring\u0014\n            market analyses about which stores and\u0014\n            attractions would best cater to Scientologists'\u0014\n            needs. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"We're trying to treat all of our citizens with\u0014\n            respect,\" says Frank Klim, communications\u0014\n            director for the City of Clearwater. \"We're a\u0014\n            democracy, we care about public safety, and we\u0014\n            aren't targeting any special efforts.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Beneath the construction cranes, Scientology's\u0014\n            shuttle buses and uniformed students move\u0014\n            between buildings. Most of downtown\u0014\n            Clearwater's main thoroughfares are marked\u0014\n            with reminders of the religious activity that takes\u0014\n            place in the surrounding buildings. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"It's generally believed that fewer people visit the\u0014\n            downtown area because of the hundreds of\u0014\n            uniformed Scientologists walking the streets,\"\u0014\n            says Marshall Van Dine, minister of First United\u0014\n            Methodist Church of Clearwater. \"But most\u0014\n            people have accepted their presence in the\u0014\n            community.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"A lot of what they have done downtown has\u0014\n            been seen as positive and community-building,\"\u0014\n            Pastor C. Philip Whitener of Grace Lutheran\u0014\n            Church told CT. \u0014\n\u0014\n            But, he wonders, \"How much control will they\u0014\n            exert?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Intimidated no more\u0014\n            Even as city officials become less anxious about\u0014\n            the presence of Scientology, some Clearwater\u0014\n            church leaders are growing more open in\u0014\n            opposing Scientology. \u0014\n\u0014\n            But most Clearwater Christians have little direct\u0014\n            contact with Scientologists. Some say their\u0014\n            church is too far from the city center; others\u0014\n            admit they avoid Scientologists for fear of\u0014\n            unpleasant confrontations or reprisals. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Many of the largest churches around Clearwater,\u0014\n            surveyed by Christianity Today, are committed\u0014\n            to getting their members involved. These\u0014\n            congregations are pooling their resources to\u0014\n            assess how they can best present the gospel to\u0014\n            all of Clearwater. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Nick Champlin, pastor of Faith Christian\u0014\n            Church, says that instead of attacking\u0014\n            Scientology, he would like to focus on exalting\u0014\n            Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"We would like to see our church explode right\u0014\n            here in the center of Scientology city,\" Champlin\u0014\n            says. \"I don't want to protest against\u0014\n            Scientologists. I'd much rather lift up the Lord\u0014\n            and see the light of the church prosper and shine,\u0014\n            proving where sin abounds, much more does\u0014\n            grace abound.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            These mobilized churches are calling on\u0014\n            resources outside of Clearwater to better\u0014\n            understand Scientology. Craig Branch of the\u0014\n            Apologetics Resource Institute and former\u0014\n            Scientologist Brian Haney visited Clearwater in\u0014\n            April to encourage and educate church\u0014\n            members. \u0014\n\u0014\n            Branch says he senses a new urgency in local\u0014\n            pastors to stand up in a spirit of Christian love\u0014\n            against Scientology. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"We're concerned about the balance between\u0014\n            educating people on Scientology's false claims\u0014\n            and yet still urging them to act with love and\u0014\n            compassion toward Scientologists,\" he says.\u0014\n            \"These churches are committed to forming a\u0014\n            prayer front and developing a heart for people\u0014\n            who are really suffering spiritually.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n            Plans are also forming to host an\u0014\n            interdenominational educational meeting this fall\u0014\n            to help Christians know what resources and\u0014\n            truths they can offer Scientologists. Some of the\u0014\n            Christians who have been most outspoken about\u0014\n            Scientology believe it will take great effort to\u0014\n            change the spiritual climate of Clearwater. \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Many churches are afraid.

George \nAllen's anti-gay diatribe on his radio show a few years ago?  Didn't \nhurt him at all. Allen has taken his cowboy boots and ever-present \nchaw to the U.S. Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Rapper Eminem's latest CD has garnered four \nGrammy nominations, including one for the prestigious Album of the \nYear award. It includes such cuddly lyrics as \"My words are like a \ndagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're \na fag or a lez. Hate fags? The answer's 'yes.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Survivor\" castaway Rudy Boesch, the former Navy \nSEAL from Virginia Beach, has parlayed his brand of crusty homophobia \ninto post-\"Survivor\" celebrity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Boesch has been the object of chanting, cheering \nfans at public appearances. A toy maker immortalized him with an \naction-figure doll. And the Virginia General Assembly paid tribute, \nwith one member describing Boesch as a \"role model.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"It's a pretty high honor,\" Boesch told \nreporters afterward. \"I never expected to be here.

That ability - to neatly pare the bigoted from the sublime - \nis a gift both useful and dangerous. It can provide clarity and \nperspective. Or it can lead us to justify the truly repugnant.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I'm not arguing against Eminem's right to \nfreedom of expression. As a journalist, that would be foolish and \nhypocritical. But I  question whether such expression makes him \nworthy of one of his industry's most coveted awards.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I'm unconvinced there is a direct chain linking \nEminem, Marilyn Manson and gangsta rap to violence against gays, \nbloodshed in the schoolhouse and killings of police officers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I do believe, however, that music and other \nforms of expression can create a climate, however subtle, in which \nhatred, violence and bigotry are more acceptable. Or even rewarded.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Do we need more evidence?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Of course, homophobia is as much a part of \nhip-hop as two turntables and a microphone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But if the tables were turned, how would we feel?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     What if rappers conjured up dreadfully racist \nstereotypes of thong-clad black women and malt-liquor swilling black \nmen?

So before \none contemplates a lifetime commitment, some important questions need \nto be answered.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Why do you want to get married? All too often, couples get married \nfor the wrong reasons. Being in love with love is not sufficient \nreason for marriage. Or if marriage is to get out of a bad home \nsituation, bad matters can worsen. The only valid reason for marriage \nis a love so strong that one wants to spend the rest of life with the \nperson loved- for better or worse, rich or poor. ...\u0014\n\u0014\n.How much of life have you tasted? Have you learned to depend on \nself? Or, are you moving from parent dependen- cy to spouse \ndependency? My marriage and family classes often hear, \"Learn to be \none before you become two; and learn to become two before you become \nthree, or four, or more!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n.How happy are you now? A single person with a happy attitude before \nmarriage probably will be a happily married person-if a partner is \nwell chosen! But if one is an \"ole grouch,\" then saying \"I do\" isn't \ngoing to change things. The basic personality doesn't change just \nbecause one walks down the aisle and exchanges a few words. Whatever \nwe are like early in life simply magnifies as we get older. Charlie \nShedd says that marriage is not so much finding the right person as \nbeing the right person. So what are you going to be like to live with \nday by day? Or what is that person with whom you are about to make a \ncommitment going to be like in the morning, after a hard day's work, \nor after taking the wrong exit off the interstate?\u0014\n\u0014\n.How long have you known this special person? To really know a person \ntakes time. During early dating especially, couples are on their best \nbehavior. Only with time does one get \"real\" and reveal the true \nself. Before a couple makes a serious commitment, each should visit \nin the home of the potential mate. How does he or she talk to parents \nand siblings? Is it with kindness and consideration? This is a good \nindication ofhow you may be treated after you are married a while.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Are you good friends? The best basis for a good marriage is to be \ngood friends first. As friends, persons can be more objective about \neach other. After emotional involvement, many faults may be \noverlooked with an attitude of \"I'll change that after we're married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n.What attracts you to this person? Is it physical or inner beauty? \nThat beautiful hair may fallout, and that flawless skin will wrinkle. \nThat perfect figure or physique may rearrange itself in time. Will \nlife still be exciting and comfort- able? Inward beauty is far more \nimportant than outward beauty-\u0014\n\u0014\n.Do you like each other? In the movie Shenandoah, the young man says \nto the father of the woman he wants to marry, \"Sir, I would like to \nmarry your daughter.\"\u0014\nThe father says, \"Do you like her?\"\u0014\nIn exasperation the young man replies, \"Sir, I love her!\" The reply \ncame softly: \"Oh, I know you love her! But what I want to know is, do \nyou like her?\"\u0014\nLiking and loving are different. We probably could love several \npersons, but we could not live peaceably with them. Do you like each \nother? is an important question.\u0014\n\u0014\n.What is your attitude toward sex ? Sexual union within marriage is \nindeed a gift. from God. For good reason, He ordained it to be kept \nwithin the marriage bond. When it is misused or abused, serious \nconsequences result. When the sex act becomes part of the dating \nrelationship, it becomes predominant, excluding the more important \nareas of life that need to be dealt with during that period. In our \ninstant society we have instant rice, oatmeal, cookies, dinner. .. \nand on we go. This may lead us to think we need to wait on nothing. \nTo wait on good things in life makes us more ap- preciative and life \nmore exciting.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Are you a good problem solver? Life is a series of prob- lems. It \nisn't whether you as a married couple or family will have problems, \nit is which problems you will have. So to learn during the dating \nperiod to resolve differences is im- portant. Do you pout, slam \ndoors, or run away? Likely you will react in much the same way as you \nsaw your parents react-that is, unless you work to be different. This \nwlll require conscious and deliberate effort.\u0014\n\u0014\n.How well do you communicate? The glue that holds it all together is \ncommunication. To be able to talk to each other-about everything-is \nimperative. This is learned during dating. To be able to share \nthoughts, feelings, happiness, and sorrows is one key to a good \nmarriage-\u0014\n\u0014\n.What are your expectations? Are your goals compati- ble? Are you \nexpecting perfection? Many couples are disil- lusioned after a short \ntime because their expectations were too high. Jesus alone is \nperfect; no one else is. Therefore, no perfect marriages and, \ndifficult as it is for parents to admit, no perfect children exist.\u0014\n\u0014\n.What are your spending habits? Do you have similar views on saving \nand spending? In most relationships, money causes more friction than \nanything. Learning to live within the budget is of utmost importance. \nFrom the begin- ning, plans need to be made to give and to save part \nof ev- erything that is earned. Then learn to live on the rest. There \nis so much pressure in our society to buy today and pay tomorrow that \nmillions of families are in serious jeopardy because of that little \nplastic card without considering that payday will come. So, who is \ngoing to write the checks? How will you decide how the money is going \nto be spent?\u0014\n\u0014\n.Where does spiritual growth fit into your relationship? Homes need \nthe strength that only God's power can give. To have Christ at the \ncenter of your relationship and your home will afford peace in the \nstorms of life. That peace comes only from each partner knowing and \ntrusting Him with each area of life. A lot to ask, you say? That is \ntrue. But marriage requires a lot. \"But the greatest of these is \nlove\" (I Cor. 13:13, RSV)\u0014",

    "words": "Mainstream' network mobilizes Baptists against 'fundamentalism' \u0014\n                                          February 6, 2001 - Volume: \n01-12 \u0014\n                      By Bob Allen \u0014\n\u0014\n                      DALLAS (ABP) -- After more than two decades of \ndenominational infighting, the vast\u0014\n                      majority of Southern Baptists remain \"largely \nuninformed\" about causes of the\u0014\n                      conflict, said Houston layman John Baugh. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of the 13 million \"mainstream\" Baptists he \nestimated are still on the sidelines of the\u0014\n                      Southern Baptist Convention controversy, Baugh \nsaid \"it is unlikely that even 10\u0014\n                      percent\" are keenly aware of the dangers of \n\"fundamentalism\" facing their churches\u0014\n                      and the nation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mainstream Baptists, meanwhile, \"are only four \nor five major decisions away from\u0014\n                      arresting the progress of and breaking the \nfundamentalist hold,\" Baugh said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To do that, the movement must \"enlist fellow \nBaptists in this ministry of freedom, and\u0014\n                      they are there to be enlisted,\" he said. To \nBaptists who say \"I don't think we can do\u0014\n                      that,\" Baugh said, \"Please don't say that, or \njust get out of the way.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Baugh spoke at a national consultation of the \nNetwork of Mainstream Baptists Feb.\u0014\n                      5-6 in Dallas. Baugh, founder of the Sysco food \ncompany and longtime critic of\u0014\n                      fundamentalism, co-convened the meeting with \nBaylor University Chancellor Herbert\u0014\n                      Reynolds. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The network has been holding annual \nconsultations for \"three or four\" years, said\u0014\n                      Reynolds. \"These consultations have proven to \nbe helpful to us and I think have\u0014\n                      helped our efforts throughout the states to \npreserve soul freedom,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      New Mainstream organizations formed last year \nin Alabama, Georgia, Illinois,\u0014\n                      Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and \nVirginia, said David Currie, head of Texas\u0014\n                      Baptists Committed, the organization after \nwhich the Mainstream groups are\u0014\n                      modeled. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those bring to 11 the number of Mainstream \norganizations working to mobilize\u0014\n                      Baptists in their states against what is termed \nalternately the \"conservative\u0014\n                      resurgence\" or \"fundamentalist takeover\" of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention. Many\u0014\n                      Mainstream leaders are active in the \nCooperative Baptist Fellowship, an\u0014\n                      Atlanta-based alternative missions organization \nthat avoids overt politicking. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mainstream founders, however, believe they can \nappeal to churches the Fellowship\u0014\n                      can't reach. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Representing Virginia's new Mainstream group, \nBill Wilson described a number of\u0014\n                      churches in his state that \"know they aren't \nfundamentalist, don't know what they\u0014\n                      think about the CBF, and we believe are the \nvast majority.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We believe there is a vast untapped potential \namong laypeople and pastors who\u0014\n                      don't feel comfortable in either group and have \nnowhere to go,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The media and other observers of the prolonged \nstruggle for control and direction of\u0014\n                      the SBC since the late 1970s typically describe \ncompeting factions as \"moderates\"\u0014\n                      and \"conservatives.\" Baugh eschewed the use of \nthose terms in describing a new\u0014\n                      grassroots movement aimed at halting the \nadvance of fundamentalism through\u0014\n                      political processes in Baptist state \nconventions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One term has been used to imply \"that we are \nmerely 'moderate' in our commitment\u0014\n                      to Christ and God's Holy Word,\" Baugh said. And \nwhile the term conservative \"gains\u0014\n                      favorable impression\" among those opposed to \nchange, Baugh said, SBC\u0014\n                      fundamentalists weren't out to \"conserve\" \nanything. In fact, he charged, they are\u0014\n                      \"revolutionaries\" who have imposed a \"new \nreligion\" on Southern Baptists. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It is as erroneous to imply that mainstream \nBaptists are moderate about their beliefs\u0014\n                      as it is to describe fundamentalists as \ntheologically conservative,\" Baugh said. He\u0014\n                      called on the denominational and secular press \nto \"forego\" the use of those terms in\u0014\n                      reporting about Baptist life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Mainstream\" Baptists, Baugh said, \"are the \npeople who prayerfully determine and\u0014\n                      hold fast to our commitments. We adhere to the \n1963 'Baptist Faith and Message.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They are the people who believe the decision \nabout whom to ordain as ministers is\u0014\n                      \"solely vested in each autonomous body of \nbelievers,\" he continued, and not in\u0014\n                      Southern Baptists' recently revised faith \nstatement that says the Bible prohibits\u0014\n                      women from serving as senior pastors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mainstream Baptists are those who \n\"sacrificially funded\" the six Southern Baptist\u0014\n                      seminaries and other convention properties and \nwho led the SBC to become the\u0014\n                      largest non-Catholic religious body and, at one \ntime, the world's fastest growing faith\u0014\n                      group. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That ended in 1979, he said, when \nfundamentalists \"systematically stole\" all that\u0014\n                      mainstream Baptists had built. The group gained \npower, he alleged, through \"a\u0014\n                      strategy based on devious means and \nMachiavellian machinations.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Baugh described actions of the new Southern \nBaptist leadership that he said indicate\u0014\n                      they have departed from the mainstream. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Baugh described as \"startling\" a change in the \n\"Baptist Faith and Message\" approved\u0014\n                      at last summer's SBC annual meeting that he \nsaid \"significantly altered the role of\u0014\n                      Jesus in order to forward the new \nfundamentalist religion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A second \"astonishing\" action at the same \nconvention, Baugh said, was when a\u0014\n                      denominational leader spoke in opposition to a \nmessenger's motion to seek peace\u0014\n                      among warring factions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The revolutionary fundamentalist religion is \nevolving before our eyes,\" Baugh said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The forces that captured the SBC are now \nworking to \"transform other areas of\u0014\n                      Christendom\" with a view toward gaining control \nof governmental bodies and then to\u0014\n                      impose their religious views on the American \npeople, Baugh said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Some of the best-known fundamentalist leaders \nin control of the Southern Baptist\u0014\n                      Convention savor the day when the protective \nbarrier separating church and state is\u0014\n                      gone,\" Baugh said. \"Fundamentalists of all \nstripes savor victory and salivate over the\u0014\n                      potential of government power.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He urged mainstream Baptists to \"stand in the \nhalls of Congress\" to dispute those\u0014\n                      who would erode the separation of church and \nstate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We mainstreamers must engage them on every \nfront,\" Baugh said. \"I think we can\u0014\n                      and believe we will break this fundamentalist \nstranglehold on Baptist life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While any conflict has two sides, Baugh said, \n\"the actions of some fellow Baptists\u0014\n                      create a third side that inadvertently aids the \ncause of fundamentalism and impedes\u0014\n                      our efforts to arrest the growth of that \nmovement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some non-fundamentalist Baptists \"seemingly \nwish us to be mute in spite of all that\u0014\n                      has been seen and heard in 20 years,\" Baugh \nsaid. \"Their demand is don't be unkind\u0014\n                      and don't be strident.  Don't talk about the \nBaptist mess to anyone.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Some of the very finest of our fellow Baptists \nhave worked for reconciliation among\u0014\n                      our people,\" Baugh said. \"I wish reconciliation \nwere possible,\" but \"our capitulation is\u0014\n                      the only response acceptable to \nfundamentalists.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perry Sanders, pastor of First Baptist Church \nof Lafayette, La., urged churches to\u0014\n                      enlist their full quota of messengers for their \nstate convention and to enlist others to\u0014\n                      do the same. \"One victory is not enough,\" he \nsaid. \"We've got to persevere 10 years\u0014\n                      at the minimum.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We've got enough people if we simply have the \nperseverance  to stay with it and\u0014\n                      not to falter and hold back.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Neutrality is complicity with the opposition,\" \nSanders said.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nBlack Leader: Biography Assesses Du Bois\u0014\n\u0014\nREVIEWED BY CLIFF DICKINSON            Feb 18, 2001  TIMES-DISPATCH\u0014\n\u0014\nW.E.B. DU BOIS: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, \n1919-1963, by David\u0014\nLevering Lewis; Henry Holt, $35.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor three decades, from the death of Booker T. Washington (1915) to \nthe end of the Second World War (1945), W.E.B. Du Bois was the single \nmost outstanding African-American figure in the nation. One of the \nprimary organizers of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People (NAACP), premier architect of the American civil \nrights movement, chief founder of the Pan-African movement, and \nleading inspirer of the modern African Liberation movement, DuBois \nwrote 21 books and edited 15 volumes and thousands of essays, \ncolumns, articles, and pamphlets. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"To know Du Bois,\" writes David Levering Lewis, author of W.E.B. Du \nBois: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919-1963, and \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Professor of History at Rutgers University, \n\"was to become acquainted with the problem of the 20th Century - the \nproblem of the color line - in one of its most intensely complex \nembodiments.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIN HIS Pulitzer Prize-winning first volume (1993), Lewis thoroughly \nanalyzed Du Bois as scholar, artist, and race leader. In the \nlong-anticipated sequel, Lewis completes the definitive biography of \none of the century's most controversial and complicated personages, \nexploring Du Bois' long\u0014\nturbulent public career between the \"Red Scare\" of 1919 and his \nself-imposed exile in Ghana in 1961. In between, Lewis reveals much. \nFight for Equality and the American Century examines his struggle to \ncontrol an increasingly militant NAACP, his little-known political \nagenda in the Harlem Renaissance, and his shift leftward toward \nseparatism in the 1930s.\u0014\n\u0014\nDu Bois' struggle with Marcus Garvey's \"back to Africa\" movement, and \nhis involvement in international affairs through the Pan-African \nmovement, reveals much about the man who regarded himself as \"the \navatar of a race whose troubled fate he was predestined to interpret \nand to direct.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBATTLING his own ideological and personal excesses, Du Bois attempted \nvirtually every possible solution to the problem of 20th Century \nracism: scholarship, integration, propaganda, cultural and economic \nseparatism, international Communism, expatriation, and Third-World \nsolidarity. \"An extraordinary mind of color in a racialized century,\" \nasserts Lewis in a particularly powerful passage, \"Du Bois was \npossessed of a principled impatience with what he saw as the \negregious failings of American democracy that drove him, decade by \ndecade, to the paradox of defending totalitarianism in the service of \na global ideal of economic and social justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFight for Equality and the American Century restores this brilliant \nvisionary and complex man to his central place in American history. \nThe scope of the work is impressive. Magisterial in tone, \nindefatigably researched, and exquisitely written, the book is \nrequired reading for anyone hoping to understand the tortured history \nof race relations.\u0014\n-------------------------------------------\u0014\nCliff Dickinson teaches U.S. history at St. Christopher's School and \nis on the staff of the Museum of the Confederacy.\u0014",

    "words": "BLONDY'S DUDE - 1957 sorrel stallion named to \nHall of Fame  3/2001\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1960, Morgan Freeman was looking for a good stallion to breed to \nhis band of mares. But it had to be a good one. He wasn't about to \nspend a lot of time or money hauling an average horse back to his \nranch in Skiatook, Oklahoma. So when Freeman saw Harold \"Huddy\" \nHudspeth take a sorrel stallion named Blondy's Dude through a reining \npattern at a show in Skiatook, he knew he'd found his horse. Blondy's \nDude, a 1957 model by Small Town Dude and out of Blondy Queen, went \non to win reining that day, and by the time Free- man inquired about \nhim, the horse's owners, ].T. WaIters and Nick McN air, of Pryor, \nOklahoma, had already priced him pretty high. They knew they had a \ngood thing, and they wouldn't sell the stallion for less than $5,000, \nwhich was a lot of money to spend on a horse 40 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I needed to spend $5,000 on a horse about like I needed pneumonia,\" \nFreeman said in the September 1969 issue of The Cattleman. \"Luckily, \nit turned out to be the best investment I ever made.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the story goes, it took Freeman a few months to scrape together \nthe money to buy Blondy's Dude, but he finally made a deal that \nconsisted of cash, some feed and a few horses thrown in to boot.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreeman and his son Jerald would earn 18 grand champion and two \nreserve champion awards in two years on the road with Blondy's Dude. \n\"Dude\" loved reining, was good at cutting, and could stand at halter \nand walk out a winner, thanks to his superior, compact conformation \nand graceful, flowing neck.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a real intelligent horse,\" said Jerald, who is now a church \npastor and still very active in the family horse business. \"He \n(Morgan Freeman) bought him on the basis of what a performance horse \nhe was, but he could go on and do it all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBlondy's Dude was a two-time grand champion at the Tulsa State Fair \nand  was the 1962 grand champion at the Southwestern Exposition and \nFat Stock Show\\ Exposition in Ft. Worth and thanks to his proficiency \nas sire, he ranks 18th on AQHA's all-time leading sires list. His \n1,402 foals in 21 crops amassed more than 10,000 points. His \noffspring have gone on to produce 25 open and five youth champions \nwithin AQHA competition. They have competed in western pleasure, \nhunter under saddle, horsemanship, reining, working cow horse, \ncutting, western riding, team roping and calf roping.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to AQHA competition, offspring of Blondy's Dude have \nearned some $630,000 within the NRHA and more than $21,000 in NCHA \ncompetition.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He (Blondy's Dude) and Dad were quite a pair,\" Jerald said. \" At \nthat time, the Lord really used Blondy's Dude to put us in the horse \nbusiness. We'd roped and shown before, but he really put us in the \nindustry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter breeding a full book of mares in 1980, Blondy's Dude was laid \nto rest at the age of 23. The stallion was buried in the Freemans' \nfront yard where his headstone reads \"God gives his best to those \nthat leave the choice to him.\"\u0014",

Fifty years ago, an estimated 15 to 25 \npercent of the\u0014\n                      Palestinian Arab community was Christian. \nToday, in the\u0014\n                      West Bank, Christians are only about 1.5 \npercent of the total\u0014\n                      population. While suffering under attack from \nIsraeli gunfire,\u0014\n                      Arab Christians have occasionally become the \ntarget of\u0014\n                      Islamic extremists as well. Christian-owned \nliquor stores in\u0014\n                      Gaza have been attacked. Radical Islamic \npreachers\u0014\n                      occasionally have included Christians in now \nroutine\u0014\n                      messages of anti-Jewish hate. But the \nperpetrators of\u0014\n                      anti-Christian propaganda, unlike those who \nhate Jews, have\u0014\n                      been quickly silenced by the Palestine \nAuthority.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      According to the Jerusalem Post, an Israeli \nofficial has\u0014\n                      claimed that hundreds of Palestinians, mostly\u0014\n                      Bethlehem-area Christians who hold foreign \npassports, have\u0014\n                      left the country in the course of the recent \nconflict.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Arab church officials have hotly denied those \nreports, claiming\u0014\n                      that Israel, in circulating such stories, is \nattempting to drive a\u0014\n                      wedge between Christian and Muslim \nPalestinians. Arab\u0014\n                      Christian leaders have stated their loyalty to \nthe Palestinian\u0014\n                      cause.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christianswho enjoy a slightly higher economic \nstatus,\u0014\n                      better education, and business and marital \nlinks to the\u0014\n                      Westcan travel abroad more easily than most \nMuslims.\u0014\n                      Now more than ever, Christians fear becoming a \nmuseum\u0014\n                      piece in the land of Jesus' birth. For the vast \nmajority of\u0014\n                      Christians who remain, the reports of \nemigration are an ugly\u0014\n                      stain on their national loyalties, especially \nwhen the\u0014\n                      Palestinian national revolt against Israel has \ntaken on a\u0014\n                      distinctly Islamic flavor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This latest dispute began with Muslim-Israeli \nclashes at\u0014\n                      Jerusalem's key Islamic holy site, al-Aqsa \nMosque.\u0014\n                      Conflicting Jewish-Muslim claims to the area, \nregarded by\u0014\n                      Jews as the ancient Temple Mount, have played a \nmajor role\u0014\n                      in fueling the conflict, dubbed the \"al-Aqsa \nUprising.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The Arab Christian community in the \nPalestinian Territories\u0014\n                      is an integral part of the Palestinian people,\" \nsaid the Rev.\u0014\n                      Raed Abusahlia, chancellor of the Latin \n(Catholic) Patriachate\u0014\n                      in an outraged letter denying the reports that \nChristians are\u0014\n                      emigrating. \"It suffers with it, rejoices with \nit, and shares with\u0014\n                      it the same hopes and aspirations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Our position is that nobody should emigrate or \nleave,\" added\u0014\n                      Younan, the Lutheran bishop. \"They should stay \nin this\u0014\n                      country with all of the difficulties.

In Camp David, people felt that the peace \nthat they\u0014\n                      were offered was merely a surrender.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It was very clear people would react. We \ndidn't know how.\u0014\n                      But thanks to Ariel Sharon, a direction was \nfound,\" she said,\u0014\n                      referring to the Israeli opposition leader's \nSept. 28 visit to\u0014\n                      al-Aqsa, which touched off the first round of \nriots.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Torn between tolerance and justice\u0014\n                      Carmi's personal story is typical of many \nChristians in this\u0014\n                      region who are forced to navigate the \ntumultuous currents of\u0014\n                      Middle East history. A tall, gentle-faced \nredhead, she was\u0014\n                      born in Jerusalem to an Armenian family, which \nfled to\u0014\n                      Palestine in 1917 from Turkey, escaping the \nTurkish genocide\u0014\n                      of the Armenian community.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Her family was forced to flee again from a west \nJerusalem\u0014\n                      neighborhood to the city's eastern Arab sector \nwhen the city\u0014\n                      was divided between Israel and Jordan in 1948. \nCarmi thus\u0014\n                      became a refugee in the city of her birth. Like \nmany local\u0014\n                      Christians, Carmi has tried to maintain a \nbalance between her\u0014\n                      commitment to tolerance and reconciliation and \nher quest for\u0014\n                      justice for Palestinians.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both, she says, are rooted in her Christian \nfaith and\u0014\n                      experience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I grew up among the historic sites and the \nmonuments.

It was a mainline church, which meant \n(among other\u0014\n                      things) that the Scripture readings for each \nSunday were\u0014\n                      prescribed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the best of circumstances, set readings \nmotivate preachers\u0014\n                      to dig into a Bible passage not of their own \nchoosing and to\u0014\n                      listen there for the voice of God. In the worst \nof\u0014\n                      circumstances, preachers discover some phrase \nin the text\u0014\n                      that reminds them of something else they'd \nrather talk\u0014\n                      abouta joke, a favorite scene from a movie, \nsome\u0014\n                      therapeutic insight from a self-help book, or \nsome political\u0014\n                      agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The first Sunday I visited that church was \namong the worst of\u0014\n                      circumstances. It was the Sunday of the church \nyear devoted\u0014\n                      to celebrating the Trinity. The Old Testament \nreading from\u0014\n                      Exodus 3 told the story of Moses at the burning \nbush. There\u0014\n                      God reveals to Moses how he plans to fulfill \nthe pledge he\u0014\n                      made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by using \nMoses to\u0014\n                      liberate their descendants from slavery. God \nnot only renews\u0014\n                      his pledge in this story, he reveals his \nineffable name. This is\u0014\n                      a pivot point in the Bible, a hinge on which \nthe door of sacred\u0014\n                      history swings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the preacher existentialized and \ntrivialized it. He talked\u0014\n                      not about the doors of history but of life's \nstages. Moses was\u0014\n                      afraid to walk through the door set before him, \nthe preacher\u0014\n                      said, but he walked through it anyway. We too \nface doors\u0014\n                      that we must walk through. End of message. No \nGod. No\u0014\n                      divine plan revealed. No theophany. Just stages \nin the life\u0014\n                      cycle. The bulletin promised a different \npreacher for the next\u0014\n                      Sunday, so I came back.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The next Sunday's Old Testament lesson \nrecounted the voice\u0014\n                      of God speaking out of the whirlwind to Job. In \nJob 38, God\u0014\n                      asks Job if he knows who \"shut in the sea with \ndoors, when it\u0014\n                      burst forth from the womb\" and where he was \nwhen God\u0014\n                      \"prescribed bounds for\" the sea \"and said, \n'Thus far shall you\u0014\n                      come  and here shall your proud waves be \nstayed'?\" The\u0014\n                      Gospel lesson was from Mark 4, in which Jesus \nstills a storm\u0014\n                      on the lake and the awe-struck disciples wonder \naloud, \"Who\u0014\n                      then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Scripture leaflet in the church bulletin \nplaced this title\u0014\n                      over the Gospel story: \"Jesus stills the storm \nand shows that\u0014\n                      he is Lord of all creation.\" Mark took this \nevent as a\u0014\n                      theophany. But the preacher took it as a story \nabout our\u0014\n                      anxieties when we travel, and offered us a lame \njoke about a\u0014\n                      woman who was not comforted by knowing that \nthree bishops\u0014\n                      were flying on her airplane. The sermon may \nhave soothed\u0014\n                      some fears, but theologically it crashed and \nburned. I didn't\u0014\n                      come back the third Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not just a liberal problem\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It would be easy to write these bad sermons off \nas a\u0014\n                      symptom of a liberal malady. But many \nevangelical pulpits\u0014\n                      serve their own version of this liberal dish.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Evangelical preachers may not deny Jesus' \nmiracles, but they\u0014\n                      often strip them of their New Testament \nsignificance. Instead\u0014\n                      of viewing them as signs that Messianic \npromises are fulfilled\u0014\n                      in Jesus, they make these miracles into \npromises that\u0014\n                      contemporary believers will prosper and be in \nhealth. We dull\u0014\n                      the critical edge of Jesus' parables, which \nslashed original\u0014\n                      hearers for faithlessness, and reduce the \nparables to lessons\u0014\n                      for effective living. We deprive the moral \nteaching of Jesus of\u0014\n                      its eschatological context \n(the-coming-yet-already-present\u0014\n                      Kingdom), handing out mere moralisms and \nthree-step\u0014\n                      how-to's.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Each biblical passage is a pixel in a greater \npicture, a dot in a\u0014\n                      halftone; and thus we would be wise to keep in \nmind the great\u0014\n                      sweep of sacred historyfrom Creation and Fall \nto\u0014\n                      Restoration, from the eating of forbidden fruit \nto the tree\u0014\n                      whose leaves are for the healing of the nations.\u0014\n                      Consciousness of salvation history will help us \nkeep our\u0014\n                      messages on the message of the passages from \nwhich we\u0014\n                      preach.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The religions of the ancient Near East were \nvery different from\u0014\n                      the religion of Yahweh. They were not, by and \nlarge, ethical\u0014\n                      religions. They did not celebrate the God who \nbreaks into\u0014\n                      history to emancipate his people or who \npromises to bring\u0014\n                      ultimate justice. By means of imitative magic \nor ecstatic\u0014\n                      encounters, they tried to control the cycle of \ntime: the\u0014\n                      seasons of planting and harvest, of fertility \nand mortality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Old Testament reveals a very different \nreligionone in\u0014\n                      which time does not move in cycles but in a \ngrand arc from\u0014\n                      human disaster through a series of divine \nrescues to a grand\u0014\n                      conclusion. Each Jewish festival was an \nexercise in\u0014\n                      communal memory designed to preserve a believing\u0014\n                      community for a glorious future. They \ncommemorated the\u0014\n                      liberation from slavery, the giving of the law, \nand the years of\u0014\n                      wandering as pilgrims, making foundational \nevents present\u0014\n                      again. But they looked forward as well. \nConsider the closing\u0014\n                      words of the Passover Seder (\"Next year in \nJerusalem!\") and\u0014\n                      the empty chair reserved for Elijah, the \nprophet who is to\u0014\n                      come \"before the great and terrible day of the \nLord\" (Mal.\u0014\n                      4:56). When Jesus celebrated his last Passover \nmeal with\u0014\n                      his disciples, he not only asked them to do \nthis in memory of\u0014\n                      him but also pointed to the eschatological \nbanquet when he\u0014\n                      would again drink the cup with them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Preaching to the End\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In \"Big-Picture Faith\" (see p. 88), Timothy \nGeorge reviews the\u0014\n                      outline of salvation history. Not every sermon \nneeds to\u0014\n                      rehearse this history, but every preacher \nshould keep in mind\u0014\n                      that each scriptural passage is a part of the \nwhole, a whole\u0014\n                      that has a narrative shape and that moves \ntoward the End.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thus when we preach about holy living, we \nshould do it as\u0014\n                      Jesus and the apostles did. They anchored their \nethics to two\u0014\n                      dramatic high points in the salvation drama: \nJesus' sacrifice\u0014\n                      on the cross and the coming Day of the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Paul, for example, writes about how the \nrighteous act of the\u0014\n                      second Adam has reversed the curse brought on \nby the sin of\u0014\n                      the first Adam. He then asks how we can \ncontinue in sin in\u0014\n                      this new era of grace. For Paul, Jesus' \ndefinitive action in\u0014\n                      human history makes continued sin unthinkable. \nPeter,\u0014\n                      writing about the fire that will dissolve the \nelements in the Day\u0014\n                      of the Lord, asks what manner of persons we \nought to be \"in\u0014\n                      lives of holiness and godliness.\" Jesus' \nparables of\u0014\n                      justicefor example, the Rich Man and Lazarus \n(Luke\u0014\n                      16:1931) and the Separation of the Sheep from \nthe Goats\u0014\n                      (Matt. 25:3146)are framed by Last Things: \ndeath,\u0014\n                      judgment, heaven, hell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We should also preach messages of comfort and\u0014\n                      encouragement, but as the apostles did. They \nsecured their\u0014\n                      words of comfort to Jesus' triumph over death \nand the\u0014\n                      certainty of his second coming. And they tied \ntheir\u0014\n                      exhortations of encouragement to the \nfaithfulness of Jesus\u0014\n                      and the heroes of the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thus Paul uses both Jesus' resurrection and his \nfuture return\u0014\n                      to frame words of comfort to those grieving the \ndeath of fellow\u0014\n                      Christians (1 Thess. 4:1318). And the author \nof Hebrews ties\u0014\n                      his exhortation to endurance to Jesus' \nperseverance in the\u0014\n                      face of the cross and his elevation to God's \nright hand (Heb.\u0014\n                      12:12).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We should also preach messages about intimacy \nwith God,\u0014\n                      but as Jesus and the apostles did. Both \nholiness and\u0014\n                      intimacy are possible for Christians because of \nthe coming of\u0014\n                      the Holy Spirit marked by Pentecost. Jesus \nconfronted the\u0014\n                      disciples' separation anxiety in his farewell \ndiscourse by\u0014\n                      teaching that continued intimacy would be \nthrough the Holy\u0014\n                      Spirit he would send (John 1416).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This intimacy makes Paul look forward to the \nEnd: The fact\u0014\n                      that we have received a spirit of sonship and \nthat the Spirit\u0014\n                      bears witness with our spirits that we are \nchildren of God\u0014\n                      means that we are heirs with Christ of a future \nglory (Rom. 8).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A consciousness of the story of God's \nintervention in human\u0014\n                      history can keep our talk about holy living \nfrom turning into\u0014\n                      self-help chatter and our encouragements from \nbeing mere\u0014\n                      pep talks. It can keep our talk about intimacy \nwith God from\u0014\n                      turning to empty introspection and our messages \nof comfort\u0014\n                      from melting into sentimentality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Simply put, it brings a confidence, strength, \nand hope that\u0014\n                      much homiletic fare cannot match.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      David Neff is editor of Christianity Today.\u0014",

Often the letter writers wish \nto know if their\u0014\n                      beliefs about baptism are grounded in the \npractices of the\u0014\n                      early church. The answer is usually yes and no, \nfor while\u0014\n                      most churches retain some early baptismal \npractices (in\u0014\n                      altered form), I'm not aware of any church that \nrepeats the\u0014\n                      entire ancient ceremony. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In about A.D. 215 Hippolytus, an important \necclesiastical\u0014\n                      writer and theologian who was for some reason \nquickly\u0014\n                      forgotten after his death, recorded in detail \nthe process by\u0014\n                      which converts in Rome were baptized. As \nsummarized by\u0014\n                      scholar Michael Walsh, Hippolytus's account \nbegan:\u0014\n                      \"Immediately before the ceremony came a fast, a \nlong period\u0014\n                      of prayer, an all-night vigil in a darkened \nbuilding.

There \nwere repeated\u0014\n                      anointings with oil, the symbol of strength. \nOnce at least the\u0014\n                      naked candidate was anointed from head to toe. \nThen, oiled\u0014\n                      as if for bathing, the candidate entered the \nfont, climbing in \u0014\n                      or stepping down until knee-deep while a deacon \npoured\u0014\n                      water over the head, or pressed the candidate's \nhead down\u0014\n                      into the pool.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The baptismal candidate also had to answer a \nseries of\u0014\n                      questions, which Hippolytus lists: \"And when he \nwho is being\u0014\n                      baptized goes down into the water, he who \nbaptizes him,\u0014\n                      putting his hand on him, shall say thus: 'Dost \nthou believe in\u0014\n                      God, the Father Almighty?'\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"And he who is being baptized shall say: 'I \nbelieve.'\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Then holding his hand placed on his head, he \nshall baptize\u0014\n                      him once.

    "title": "BACKING HITLER",
    "words": "By Robert Gellately\u0014\nReviewed by Gerhard L. Weinberg\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Just over a decade ago people could see on \ntelevision how the population of the\u0014\n                   German Democratic Republic overthrew their \ngovernment in spite of its forty years to\u0014\n                   consolidate power and a huge police apparatus to \nmaintain it. Once it was clear that\u0014\n                   Red Army units stationed there had orders to stay \nin their barracks, to not put down\u0014\n                   the revolt as in 1953, the regime collapsed in the \nface of popular discontent. Robert\u0014\n                   Gellately's book provides the answer to the \nquestion: why did nothing like this\u0014\n                   happen in Nazi Germany, a system that had a twelve \nyear life and a far smaller\u0014\n                   police apparatus for a population four times as \nlarge?\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Outsiders become scapegoats\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Having earlier published a seminal study of the \nway in which the Gestapo, the secret\u0014\n                   police, actually operated, especially the extent \nto which it depended on popular\u0014\n                   acquiescence and denunciations from the public to \ninitiate proceedings, Gellately\u0014\n                   now offers a comprehensive examination of the vast \nmajority of the German public\u0014\n                   as it cooperatedoften enthusiasticallywith the \nregime. Although he takes too\u0014\n                   much of the silly criticism of the Weimar Republic \nat face value and overlooks its loss\u0014\n                   of public support already in the election of 1920, \nthe author shows a population\u0014\n                   prepared to accept a vast extension of police \npower to harass, imprison, and even kill\u0014\n                   any and all considered or imagined to be in any \nway harmful to othersor even\u0014\n                   suspected of possibly becoming harmful in the \nfuture. As long as victims could be\u0014\n                   pictured as outsiders, a regime always sensitive \nto public attitudes could be\u0014\n                   confident that the masses untouched by direct \nterror would approve.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Massive publicity about the wonderful activities \nof the police, enthusiastic coverage\u0014\n                   of the concentration camps, and the pretense that \ncrime rates were falling when in\u0014\n                   fact they were rising all contributed to a sense \nof increasing well-being by the vast\u0014\n                   majority. Gellately omits reference to the double \nmurder of Adolf Hitler's predecessor\u0014\n                   as chancellor and his wife in June 1934; the ready \nacceptance of this by the\u0014\n                   contemporary German public could be contrasted \nwith how people in this country\u0014\n                   might have reacted had President Reagan or \nPresident Clinton had their\u0014\n                   predecessors shot with their wives a year and a \nhalf after assuming office                      \u0014\n                   themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Very careful analysis of surviving police records \nas well as the relevant literature\u0014\n                   provides the author with a solid basis for his \nanalysis. We see the way in which\u0014\n                   massive denunciations by individuals to the police \nprovide the latter with an aura of\u0014\n                   ubiquity in the face of a reality of sparse \ncoverage. During the war, it was the\u0014\n                   millions of foreign workers and prisoners of war \nbrought into the country for forced\u0014\n                   labor that preoccupied the police. In this task \nalso, especially in regard to friendly\u0014\n                   and sexual relations between Germans and the \nforced workers, the police could rely\u0014\n                   on the flow of denunciations from neighbors often \nmotivated more by malice than\u0014\n                   ideological zeal. And as long as the harsh \nmeasures against Jews appeared to be\u0014\n                   orderly and pseudo-legaland offered opportunities \nfor personal enrichmentthese\u0014\n                   too were accepted with enthusiasm or indifference \nby most. It would have\u0014\n                   strengthened the author's case to allude to the \nconsiderable initiative of municipal\u0014\n                   governments in the early stages of persecution and \nto the silence of the Christian\u0014\n                   churches when hundreds of Jewish houses of worship \nwere burned in November\u0014\n                   1938.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Cooperative to the bitter end\u0014\n\u0014\n                   With lots of publicized death sentences for any \nconsidered outsiders, and on the\u0014\n                   other hand a large reservoir of public support for \nthe regime, the Germans held\u0014\n                   together and continued to back the regime into its \nlast days. Even in 1945 most\u0014\n                   opposition was devoted to sparing local \ncommunities from death and destruction,\u0014\n                   not to halting the last minute slaughter of \nprisoners, slave laborers, and other victims\u0014\n                   of the regime. The author generally stays away \nfrom the subject of the resistance to\u0014\n                   Hitler's regime that has attracted a great deal of \nattention.

Their attempt \nto seize power by a coup from\u0014\n                   above rather than an uprising from below reflects \nthe fact that their assessment was\u0014\n                   similar to the author's: that the German \npopulation stood solidly behind the regime.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   About the Author: Robert Gellately holds the \nStrassler Family Chair for the Study of\u0014\n                   Holocaust History at Clark University, and is the \nauthor of the acclaimed book \"The\u0014\n                   Gestapo and German Society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   About the Reviewer: Gerhard L.

    "words": "Beyond Flesh and Blood\u0014\n                      I used to disdain biblical talk of \"invisible \nspirits.\" No more.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Philip Yancey | posted 3/27/01\u0014\n                      Thoreau once remarked that the ancientswith \ntheir gorgons,\u0014\n                      unicorns, and sphinxesimagined more than \nexisted,\u0014\n                      whereas moderns cannot even imagine so much as \nexists. I\u0014\n                      confess that as a child of a reductionist age, \nI used to explain\u0014\n                      away biblical talk about supernatural \"powers.\" \nI would read\u0014\n                      accounts of demon possession in the Gospels and \ninstead\u0014\n                      see signs of mental illness or epilepsy. I \ncould not stomach\u0014\n                      the notion of a world ruled by invisible \nspirits. I have changed,\u0014\n                      however, for the simple reason that my \nreductionist instincts\u0014\n                      failed to explain the world around me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I saw one powerful force at work in downtown \nChicago, where\u0014\n                      I attended a church full of diversity. Homeless \npeople would\u0014\n                      sit on the pews next to M.B.A.s from \nNorthwestern and the\u0014\n                      University of Chicago. Some of the M.B.A.s \nattended a class\u0014\n                      I taught, and I knew them as reserved, \nsophisticated seekers\u0014\n                      after truth. Yet during the week, from a \nvisitors' balcony above\u0014\n                      the Chicago Board of Trade, I could watch these\u0014\n                      mild-mannered friends run around the floor, \nwaving their arms\u0014\n                      in the air and screaming at the top of their \nlungs. They would\u0014\n                      later explain to me that the price of futures \nin pork bellies had\u0014\n                      been fluctuating wildly, and they were acting \nlike madmen in\u0014\n                      order to lock in speculative shares of the \nprice of hog innards\u0014\n                      for their clients. Money exerts a most potent \nforce on human\u0014\n                      behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Jesus encountered this same force, which \ndrove people\u0014\n                      to build beautiful palaces on the shores of the \nSea of Galilee\u0014\n                      while some in Palestine lived as slaves, he \nrecognized it as a\u0014\n                      spiritual power and gave it the name of the god \nMammon.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Worse Than Beasts\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I had a conversation with Bob Seiple, then \npresident of World\u0014\n                      Vision, shortly after he had returned from \nRwanda following\u0014\n                      the 1994 massacres there. Standing on a bridge, \nhe had\u0014\n                      watched thousands of bodies float beneath him \non a river\u0014\n                      scarlet with their blood. Hutu tribesmen had \nhacked to death\u0014\n                      with machetes almost a million Tutsistheir \nneighbors, their\u0014\n                      fellow parishioners, their school \nclassmatesfor reasons no\u0014\n                      one could begin to explain. Seiple seemed badly \nshaken. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It was a crisis of faith for me,\" he said. \"I \nhad to ask myself\u0014\n                      whether the Spirit that is in me is truly \ngreater than the prince\u0014\n                      of this world. There are no categories to \nexpress such horror.\u0014\n                      Someone used the word bestialityno, that \ndishonors the\u0014\n                      beasts. Animals kill for food, not for \npleasure. They kill one or\u0014\n                      two prey at a time, not a million for no reason \nat all.\" As I\u0014\n                      listened to Seiple, I too could think of no \nforce in nature to\u0014\n                      explain what was happening in Rwanda, only a \nmalevolent\u0014\n                      force from supernature.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In his book \"The Powers That Be\", theologian \nWalter Wink\u0014\n                      makes clear that the powers and authorities are \nnot \"some\u0014\n                      kind of invisible demonic beings flapping \naround in the sky,\u0014\n                      occasionally targeting some luckless mortal \nwith their\u0014\n                      invisible payload of disease, lust, possession, \nor death.\" Yet\u0014\n                      Wink insists that the biblical language about \npowers and\u0014\n                      authorities speaks to actual realities that \ncannot be described\u0014\n                      in the reductionist language of sociology, \npolitics, and depth\u0014\n                      psychology.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Try to explain on rational grounds the mass \ninsanity that\u0014\n                      seized Germany in Hitler's day. Explain the \nlogic behind the\u0014\n                      Cold War arms race, in which both sides \naccepted the\u0014\n                      appropriately named policy of mad (Mutual \nAssured\u0014\n                      Destruction). Explain the rationale behind a \nNasdaq crash, or\u0014\n                      the sudden collapse of economies in Asia and \nLatin America.\u0014\n                      What keeps a wealthy nation like the United \nStates from\u0014\n                      finding shelter for its homeless population? \nWhat keeps the\u0014\n                      world from feeding the 30,000 people who die \nmalnourished\u0014\n                      each day? The experts have no answer but \n\"forces beyond\u0014\n                      our control.\" New Testament writers agree and \ndo not hesitate\u0014\n                      to name those powers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In view of all the evil, exploitation, and \nviolence in the world,\u0014\n                      perhaps the Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch has it \nright: You\u0014\n                      can only believe in God if you believe in the \ndevil as well.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I did not change my belief in the powers \nbecause I learned\u0014\n                      anything new about this world.

A further three gave \nmore subtle answers\u0014\n                       but still made clear their belief that the \nResurrection took place three\u0014\n                       days after the Crucifixion on Good Friday. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       About a quarter of the 43 diocesan bishops \ndeclined to respond,\u0014\n                       although some were on days off, on sabbatical \nor on Lenten retreats. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The poll has established a surprising \northodoxy in the Church of\u0014\n                       England, according to the author Lloyd Evans \nin tomorrows\u0014\n                       Spectator magazine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Bishops who hold traditional beliefs on the \nResurrection include the\u0014\n                       Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, and \nthe Archbishop of\u0014\n                       York, Dr David Hope. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       A spokesman for Dr Carey said: Jesus Christ \nis risen.

A spokesman for Dr Hope said: The \nArchbishop of York\u0014\n                       believes that the physical body of Our Lord \nwas raised from the dead\u0014\n                       on the first Easter morning and that it \nassumed a spiritual form which\u0014\n                       continued to sustain the apostles and the \nEarly Church until the\u0014\n                       Ascension. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Rev James \nJones, said: The fact\u0014\n                       that Jesus appeared to over 500 people at one \ntime shows that it was\u0014\n                       an objective experience.  \u0014\n\u0014\n                       While the bishops still hold orthodox \nChristian beliefs, a third of the\u0014\n                       public believes in the biblical version of the \nResurrection, according to\u0014\n                       a survey of 1,000 people by Fortean Times. \nHalf believed that there\u0014\n                       was an alternative explanation.

Mississippi \nprosecutors reopened the case\u0014\n                      more than a year ago but have yet to file \nmurder charges. \"The successful\u0014\n                      prosecution in Alabama shows juries are \nlistening to what you have,\" says\u0014\n                      James Ingram, who headed the FBI's civil rights \noffice in Mississippi in the\u0014\n                      mid-1960s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fresh information. Mississippi Attorney General \nMike Moore says several\u0014\n                      people contacted him last week offering fresh \ninformation in the 1964\u0014\n                      murder case, which had stalled because of the \ndeath of several prospective\u0014\n                      witnesses and defendants. Despite the setbacks, \nhe says there could still\u0014\n                      be indictments in the case later this year. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rita Schwerner Bender, the widow of Michael \nSchwerner, is eager for the\u0014\n                      case to come to trial. \"The reason for trying \nthis case is not to make family\u0014\n                      members feel better, but rather because it is \nan important piece of\u0014\n                      understanding the role of the state in creating \nan atmosphere of terror, in\u0014\n                      which violence can occur,\" she says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the Birmingham bombing, the most damning \npiece of evidence presented\u0014\n                      was a secretly recorded tape from an FBI bug in \nBlanton's kitchen. Blanton\u0014\n                      insisted he was innocent, but the jury of eight \nwhites and four blacks11 of\u0014\n                      them womenreturned a guilty verdict in just \nover two hours.

    "title": "BOB DYLAN: STILL BLOWING IN THE WIND",
    "words": "Bob Dylan: Still Blowin' in the Wind\u0014\n                      Christianity Today reviews Dylan's work before \nthe singer's conversion to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Daniel J. Evearitt | posted 5/24/01\u0014\n                      From the December 3, 1976, issue of \nChristianity Today: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sixteen years ago nineteen-year-old Robert \nZimmerman moved from\u0014\n                      Minnesota to New York City. He left behind his \npast, his family, and his name.\u0014\n                      Ahead was his new life as Bob Dylan, \ninfluential singer-songwriter. Over the\u0014\n                      years countless artists have recorded Dylan's \nsongs, and he has toured the\u0014\n                      world. Dylan is one of the three major \ntrendsetters in popular music, the other\u0014\n                      two being Elvis Presley and the Beatles. The \npress has hailed him as a\u0014\n                      prophet, a leader, a teacher, a messiah, a \npoet, the voice of young America,\u0014\n                      and the conscience of his generation. Dylan \nsays he's just a songwriter.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Throughout his career Dylan has reflected his \nreligious upbringing. Raised in a\u0014\n                      strict Jewish home, he fills his songs with \nreligious language, biblical\u0014\n                      references and characters, and theological \nquestions. He views man in the\u0014\n                      light of the cosmic struggle between good and \nevil. Man must choose to\u0014\n                      follow God and truth or fall into death, decay, \nand ultimate judgment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Gates of Eden\" (1965) says the world is evil \nbut \"there are no sins inside the\u0014\n                      Gates of Eden.\" Dylan sees the world as \"sick  \nhungry  tired  torn/It looks\u0014\n                      like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born\" \n(\"Song to Woody,\" 1962); as a\u0014\n                      \"concrete world full of souls\" (\"The Man in \nMe,\" 1970); and as a \"world of\u0014\n                      steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be \nfree\" (\"Shelter From the\u0014\n                      Storm,\" 1974). Technologically advanced America \nthreatens human freedom,\u0014\n                      feels Dylan, who confesses that \"the man in me \nwill hide sometimes to keep\u0014\n                      from being seen/ But that's just because he \ndoesn't want to turn into some\u0014\n                      machine.\" In \"It's AIright, Ma (I'm Only \nBleeding)\" (1965), his sermon in song\u0014\n                      line by line decries the phoniness of society's \ngames. \"Human gods\" make\u0014\n                      \"everything from toy guns that spark/ To flesh \ncolored Christs that glow in the\u0014\n                      dark.\" \"Not much is really sacred,\" Dylan \nconcludes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Early in his career Dylan wrote many \nfinger-pointing songs about man's\u0014\n                      inhumanity to man. He sang out against racial \nprejudice, hatred, and war.\u0014\n                      \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" perhaps his most famous \nsong, asks, \"How many ears\u0014\n                      must one man have/Before he can hear people \ncry?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Freedom and sin are major themes in a number of \nDylan's songs. \"With God on\u0014\n                      Our Side\" (1963) is a satirical justification \nof war. In \"Masters of War\" (1963)\u0014\n                      he lashes out at the war profiteers who make \nmoney from young men's lives.\u0014\n                      He concludes that \"Even Jesus would \nnever/Forgive what you do.\" This cool,\u0014\n                      calculated evil will be punished, for \"All the \nmoney you made/Will never buy\u0014\n                      back your soul.\" Dylan retells the story of \nAbraham and Isaac in \"Highway 61\u0014\n                      Revisited\" (1965). Abraham questions God, who \nreplies, \"You can do what you\u0014\n                      want Abe, but/The next time you see me coming \nyou'd better run.\" Abraham\u0014\n                      complies, knowing that peace with God comes \nonly through obedience to\u0014\n                      God's directives. Ten years later Dylan \nreiterated that in \"Oh Sister\": \"Is not\u0014\n                      our purpose the same on this earth/ To love and \nfollow His direction?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hard Rain, his most recent album, contains a \nlive concert version of \"Lay,\u0014\n                      Lady, Lay,\" written in 1969. Dylan adds these \nlyrics: \"You can have the\u0014\n                      truth/But you've got to choose it.\" Is man \nultimately responsible for sin? Is\u0014\n                      man really free? Yes, man is free to choose to \nobey or disobey divine\u0014\n                      directives, but he is responsible and will be \njudged (\"I'd Hate to Be You on\u0014\n                      That Dreadful Day\" and \"Whatcha Gonna Do?,\" \n1962).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan reads the Bible, and his favorite parts \nare the parables of Jesus. The\u0014\n                      album John Wesley Harding, recorded in 1968, \ntwo years after his nearly fatal\u0014\n                      motorcycle accident, contains a song patterned \nafter those parables. \"The\u0014\n                      Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\" tells \nof Frankie Lee's thirst for wealth\u0014\n                      and his sensual lust, which ultimately bring \nhis downfall and death. Frankie Lee\u0014\n                      denies that eternity exists. Dylan moralizes, \n\"Don't go mistaking Paradise for\u0014\n                      that home across the road.\" So many people fail \nto think of anything besides\u0014\n                      their own quest for wealth; eternity means \nnothing to them. \"Three Angels\"\u0014\n                      (1970) play horns atop poles as people, \noblivious, hurry by. \"Does anyone\u0014\n                      hear the music they play?/ Does anyone even \ntry?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan views man spiritually. In \"Dirge\" (1973) \nhe confesses, \"I felt that place\u0014\n                      within/ That hollow place/ Where martyrs weep/ \nAnd angels play with sin.\" In\u0014\n                      \"Simple Twist of Fate\" (1974) he writes of one \nwho \"Felt that emptiness\u0014\n                      inside/ To which he just could not relate.\" \nMan's spiritual cavity too often\u0014\n                      remains vacant.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan has criticized the established religious \ninstitutions. \"Got no religion.

Can't make up their\u0014\n                      minds and neither can I,\" he said early in his \ncareer. He hit at the attempts of\u0014\n                      churches and preachers to be relevant in \"Stuck \nInside of Mobile With the\u0014\n                      Memphis Blues Again\" (1966):\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Now the preacher looked so baffled\u0014\n                           When 1 asked him why he dressed\u0014\n                           With twenty pounds of headlines\u0014\n                           Stapled to his chest\u0014\n                           But he cursed me when I proved it to him.\u0014\n                           Then 1 whispered. \"Not even you can hide.\u0014\n                           You see, you're just like me.\u0014\n                           I hope you're satisfied.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Religious institutions are impotent: \"The \npriest wore black on the seventh day/\u0014\n                      And sat stone-faced while the building burned\" \n(\"Idiot Wind,\" 1974).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan views God pantheistically. \"I can see God \nin a daisy,\" he told an\u0014\n                      interviewer. \"I can see God at night in the \nwind and rain. I see creation just\u0014\n                      about everywhere. The highest form of song is \nprayer. King David's,\u0014\n                      Solomon's, the wailing of a coyote, the rumble \nof the earth.\" In his\u0014\n                      modern-day psalm \"Father of Night\" (1970), \nDylan praises God as the creator\u0014\n                      of night and day, heat and cold, loneliness and \npain. He is the Father of all\u0014\n                      \"who dwells in our hearts and our memories,\" \nthe \"Father of whom we most\u0014\n                      solemnly praise.\" Dylan's prayer for his \ngeneration and all succeeding people is\u0014\n                      outlined in \"Forever Young\" (1973): \"May God \nbless and keep you always,\"\u0014\n                      may you \"know the truth,\" be righteous, \nupright, and true and \"stay forever\u0014\n                      young.\" For as he wrote earlier, \"He not busy \nbeing born/ Is busy dying.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Sign on the Cross\" (1967), perhaps Dylan's \nmost enigmatic song, says that\u0014\n                      the sign on Jesus' cross can never be \nforgotten\"And it's still that sign on the\u0014\n                      cross/ That worries me.\" Men cannot escape that \nsymbol and what it means.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door (1972) deals with \ndeath. \"I Threw It All Away\"\u0014\n                      (1969) points to love as the ultimate force for \ngood in the world. \"Oh Sister\"\u0014\n                      tells of dying, being reborn, and being \n\"mysteriously saved.\" \"Shelter From the\u0014\n                      Storm\" finds Dylan wearing a crown of thorns \nand bargaining for salvation.\u0014\n                      \"Long Ago, Far Away\" (1962) warns that those \nwho promote brotherhood\u0014\n                      might end up hanging on a cross. \"Isis\" (1975) \nspeaks of quick prayers that\u0014\n                      easily satisfy.

The rhetoric of \nthose in leadership can be both confusing and disturbing as evidenced \nin Southern Baptist life.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrying to define Baptists today is like trying to define Americans. \nWhat categories do we use: cultural, geographical, financial, \npolitical? Obviously there are many ways to describe who we are as \nAmericans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut should it be the same when we speak of Baptists? Again the labels \nare myriad: conservative, moderate, Fundamentalist, independent, \nCalvinist, Arminian, Free Will, Seventh-Day, etc. But are there not \nsome well-defined historical, Biblical tenets that apply to Baptists? \nThere are certainly fundamentals that would be widely accepted by \nthose who call themselves Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this new century, we must distinguish between being fundamental \nand being Fundamentalist. The great axioms of Baptist life and \npractice are freedom, soul- competency and the priesthood of the \nbeliever. Yet in our day these grand truths are being redefined to \nfit into a Fundamentalist agenda. On the surface that sounds \nreasonable. However, there is a difference between being fundamental \nand being a Fundamentalist.\u0014\n\u0014\n[FUNDAMENTALISM TODAY HAS RAISED ITS LEGALISTIC HEAD AND HAS \nCORRUPTED THE FREEDOM AND INTEGRITY OF BAPTIST LIFE. MANY WHO ARE \nCAUGHT UP IN THIS CRUSADE DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES AS BEING DISRUPTIVE \nOR LEGALISTIC. THEY TRULY BELIEVE THEY ARE THE \"SAVIORS\" OF BAPTISTS.\u0014\n\u0014\nMAY IT BE SAID FIRMLY AND CLEARLY, BAPTISTS DO NOT NEED SAVIORS. WE \nALREADY HAVE ONE!]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first president and founder of the Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary in Louisville, Ky., James P. Boyce, made this statement in \nthe 19th century: \"I am fundamental but I am not a fundamentalist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fundamental is to believe in and declare the fundamentals of \nthe faith. These fundamentals are stated clearly in \"The Apostles' \nCreed.\"' These fundamentals are embraced by evangelicals and define \nthe content of our faith. Today's Fundamentalism tends to go beyond \nthese truths while presenting a pejorative rhetoric to establish its \nposition.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has become more and more difficult to be fundamental without \ntaking on the garments of Fundamentalism. In the 1920s when the \ndebate between modernism (liberalism) and Fundamentalism was at its \nheight, to be a Fundamentalist was a good thing. Men of the caliber \nof E.Y. Mullins and J. Gresham Machen, who was the founder of \nWestminster Theological Seminary, were considered Fundamentalists. \nThey upheld the fundamentals of the faith in the midst of a rising \ntide of liberalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHowever, in 2001 the term Fundamentalist has changed. Even in \nMachen's estimate of Fundamentalism, there were questions being \nraised concerning its direction and intent. In an article by John \nPiper entitled \"J. Gresham Machen's Response to Modernism,\" he quotes \nMachen's response to statements referring to him as a Fundamentalist.\u0014\n\u0014\n[THE \"GREAT CENTRAL CURRENT OF CHRISTIAN LIFE\" IS NOT USING THE BIBLE \nAS A WEAPON OF SUBMISSIVENESS TO COERCE MEN AND WOMEN INTO ONE'S \nPOLITICAL AND DOGMATIC IDEOLOGIES, BUT LETTING THE BIBLE SPEAK AS THE \nLIVING WORD OF GOD. \u0014\n\u0014\nJESUS' RESPONSE TO THE SADDUCEES RECORDED IN MATTHEW 22:29 FITS THE \nISSUE WELL: \"VOU ARE MISTAKEN, NOT UNDERSTANDING THE SCRIPTURES OR \nTHE POWER OF GOD.\" ]\u0014\nDo you suppose that I do regret my being called by a term that I \nclearly dislike, a \"fundamentalist\"? Most certainly I do. But in the \npresence of a great common foe I have little time to be attacking my \nbrethren who stand with me in the defense of the Word of God!\u0014\n\u0014\nMachen and Mullins fought a great fight against the erosion of \nBiblical truth and a demeaning of God's word. Today the battle is not \nabout the truthfulness or infallibility of the Bible, but about how \none interprets the Bible. The discussion has moved from establishing \nan exegetical, historical, Biblical meaning to the text, to \nestablishing a Fundamentalist interpretation that lines up with a \nsocial and political agenda. So the issue is not about whether we \nhave an infallible Bible, but whether we interpret that Bible \naccording to a Fundamentalist agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the above-mentioned article by Piper, he outlined the issues that \nMachen disagreed with concerning Fundamentalism. His estimation sums \nup the fallacy of Fundamentalism: (1) absence of a historical \nperspective; (2) lack of appreciation of scholarship; (3) \nsubstitution of brief skeletal creeds or confessions for historic \nconfessions; (4) lack of concern for precise formulation of Christian \ndoctrine; (5) pietistic, perfectionist tendencies (legalism); (6) \none-sided other- worldliness (i.e., a lack of effort to transform \nculture); and (7) a penchant for futuristic chiliasm \n(premillenialism). Add to this list control, a sense of superiority, \nand arrogance, and one has defined Fundamentalism in our day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis description of Fundamentalism demonstrates the radical departure \nfrom the fundamental aspects of faith. Too often this Fundamentalism \nseeks to indoctrinate rather than educate. It tends to suppress the \npursuit of truth by substituting a rigid, legalistic formula that is \nto be adhered to strictly by all who come under its sway.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times it appears that there is no room for scholarly debate and \ndialogue, or even an honest discussion on issues of doctrine and \npractice. To be a Fundamentalist is to walk in absolute conformity to \na dogma that stifles healthy discussion and removes the grandeur of \nour Baptist heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is offensive to many conservative, God-fearing, Bible-believing \nBaptists to be labeled as liberal because they do not buy into the \nlegalistic, Fundamentalist rhetoric. Again the words of Machen are \nprophetic:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term fundamentalism is distasteful to the present writer and to \nmany persons who hold views similar to his. It seems to suggest that \nwe are adherents of some strange new sect, whereas in point of fact \nwe are conscious simply of maintaining the historic Christian faith \nand of moving in the great central current of Christian life} \u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"great central current of Christian life\" is not using the Bible \nas a weapon of submissiveness to coerce men and women into one's \npolitical and dogmatic ideologies, but letting the Bible speak as the \nliving Word of God. Jesus' response to the Sadducees recorded in \nMatthew 22:29 fits the issue well: \"You are mistaken, not \nunderstanding the Scriptures or the power of God.\" The tragedy of \nFundamentalism in its purest form is that it can never be satisfied \nor rest until it dominates every sphere of life. It can brook no \nrival nor tolerate any question that would threaten its position.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism today has raised its legalistic head and has corrupted \nthe freedom and integrity of Baptist life. Many who are caught up in \nthis crusade do not see themselves as being disruptive or legalistic. \nThey truly be1ieve they are the \"saviors\" of Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay it be said firmly and clearly, Baptists do not need saviors. We \nalready have One! And it is by him that the Word of God must be \ninterpreted and proclaimed. He is the criterion, standard and measure \nby which we must judge all things, live to the glory of God, and \nembrace one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, can you be fundamental without being a Fundamentalist? \nAbsolutely! Can you be radically in love with Christ without being \nlegalistic? Absolutely! Can we walk together in unity without being \nuniform? Absolutely! To God be the glory!\u0014\n\u0014\nJess Smith is pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church, Huntsville, Ala.\u0014\n\u0014\nEndnotes:\u0014\nIThe Aoostles' Creed: \"1 believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of \nheaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord; who was \nconceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under \nPontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into \nhell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into \nheaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; \nfrom thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe \nin the Holy Spirit; the holy Christian Church; the communion of \nsaints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and \nthe life everlasting. Amen.\"\u0014\n21.

I\u0014\n                      could not stomach the notion of a world ruled \nby invisible spirits. I\u0014\n                      have changed, however, for the simple reason \nthat my reductionist\u0014\n                      instincts failed to explain the world around \nme. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I saw one powerful force at work in downtown \nChicago, where I\u0014\n                      attended a church full of diversity. Homeless \npeople would sit on the\u0014\n                      pews next to M.B.A.s from Northwestern and the \nUniversity of\u0014\n                      Chicago. Some of the M.B.A.s attended a class I \ntaught, and I knew\u0014\n                      them as reserved, sophisticated seekers after \ntruth. Yet during the\u0014\n                      week, from a visitors' balcony above the \nChicago Board of Trade, I\u0014\n                      could watch these mild-mannered friends run \naround the floor, waving\u0014\n                      their arms in the air and screaming at the top \nof their lungs. They\u0014\n                      would later explain to me that the price of \nfutures in pork bellies had\u0014\n                      been fluctuating wildly, and they were acting \nlike madmen in order to\u0014\n                      lock in speculative shares of the price of hog \ninnards for their clients.\u0014\n                      Money exerts a most potent force on human \nbehavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Jesus encountered this same force, which \ndrove people to\u0014\n                      build beautiful palaces on the shores of the \nSea of Galilee while\u0014\n                      some in Palestine lived as slaves, he \nrecognized it as a spiritual\u0014\n                      power and gave it the name of the god Mammon.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Worse Than Beasts\u0014\n                      I had a conversation with Bob Seiple, then \npresident of World Vision,\u0014\n                      shortly after he had returned from Rwanda \nfollowing the 1994\u0014\n                      massacres there. Standing on a bridge, he had \nwatched thousands\u0014\n                      of bodies float beneath him on a river scarlet \nwith their blood. Hutu\u0014\n                      tribesmen had hacked to death with machetes \nalmost a million\u0014\n                      Tutsistheir neighbors, their fellow \nparishioners, their school\u0014\n                      classmatesfor reasons no one could begin to \nexplain. Seiple\u0014\n                      seemed badly shaken. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It was a crisis of faith for me,\" he said. \"I \nhad to ask myself whether\u0014\n                      the Spirit that is in me is truly greater than \nthe prince of this world.\u0014\n                      There are no categories to express such horror. \nSomeone used the\u0014\n                      word bestialityno, that dishonors the beasts. \nAnimals kill for food,\u0014\n                      not for pleasure.

    "title": "BIOGRAPHY OF JOSEPH SMITH-AN LDS VIEW",
    "words": "Joseph Smith\u0014\n                                   by C. Clark Julius, MPS\u0014\n                                  The Philalethes - August 1987\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1827 Joseph Smith and his bride, Emma, arrived at her father's \nfarm near Great Bend in\u0014\nSusquehanna County, Pennsylvania. Here in this peaceful country along \nthe banks of the\u0014\nSusquehanna River, Joseph would spend the next two-and-a-half years \ntranslating the Book of\u0014\nMormon into English. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had been born twenty-one years earlier in Sharon, Vermont. His \nfather, also named Joseph, and\u0014\nhis mother, Lucy, had started their marriage auspiciously with Lucy's \nample dowry of one thousand\u0014\ndollars. But the dowry was quickly spent and the farm was overgrown \nwith weeds. In a last desperate\u0014\nattempt to recoup his losses, Joseph's father had invested everything \nhe had left in a shipment of\u0014\nginseng to China. He had heard that the Chinese would pay high prices \nfor the root of the ginseng\u0014\nplant, which grew wild in Vermont. When he failed to get a penny for \nhis ginseng, Joseph's father\u0014\nmoved his family to a farm near Palmyra, New York, in the western \npart of the state. There he fared\u0014\nlittle better than in Vermont. The Smith family often went hungry \nduring the winter months. As soon as\u0014\nthey were able to work, the Smith children had to help support their \nfamily. Consequently, Joseph\u0014\nobtained little schooling. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph was adolescent, an itinerant magician and diviner stopped \nover in Palmyra and\u0014\noffered his services to the local residents. The diviner claimed that \nhe could locate not only ground\u0014\nwater near the surface, but also treasure which had been buried by \nIndians many years before.\u0014\nSome farmers hired the diviner at three dollars per day to look for \nburied treasure on their lands. The\u0014\ndiviner had several magic stones which he looked into, in order to \ndiscover the sites of the buried\u0014\ntreasures. \u0014\n\u0014\nYoung Joseph Smith took a deep interest in the diviner's skills and \nspent as much time as he could in\u0014\nthe magician's company, trying to master the man's divining \nabilities. When no treasure was found\u0014\nand no more farmers would pay him, the diviner left town, but by that \ntime Joseph had picked up\u0014\nsome of his lore. Acquiring some magic stones of his own, Joseph was \nsuccessful in using the\u0014\nstones to locate some lost tools. \u0014\n\u0014\nA visitor to Palmyra who heard about Joseph's clairvoyance was \ninterested in meeting the young\u0014\nseer. The visitor was from the eastern part of New York State, and \nconvinced that Spaniards had\u0014\nonce deposited treasure on his property. Joseph agreed to accompany \nthe visitor east, and to help\u0014\nhim locate the treasure, provided that Joseph was paid three dollars \na day, the same fee the diviner\u0014\nhad charged. Joseph's father accompanied his nineteen-year-old son on \nthis expedition in 1825. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe site of the hoped-for treasure was the Susquehanna Valey near \nDamascus, New York, just north\u0014\nof the Pennsylvania border. While hunting for the treasure, Joseph \nand his father lived at a farm in\u0014\nPennsylvania, where the Susquehanna dips into that state near Great \nBend. \u0014\n\u0014\nA large party of diggers stowed up to help in excavating the \ntreasure. All of them contributed to\u0014\nJoseph's wage, in return for a share in the expected treasure. The \nwork progressed slowly. For the\u0014\nfirst few days the diggers worked with a will, anticipating the \nriches that would soon be theirs. But as\u0014\nthey dug and found nothing, their spirits began to sink. When Joseph \ntold them that the treasure had\u0014\nbegun to sink lower due to an \"enchantment,\" they suspected him of \nbeing a charlatan and felt that\u0014\nhe had made fools of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe search for treasure ended, and Joseph's father returned to his \nhome in Palmyra, but Joseph\u0014\nstayed on in the Susquehanna Valley. He had fallen in love with Emma \nHale, the daughter of Isaac\u0014\nHale, in whose house Joseph and his father had boarded during the \ntreasurehunt. Emma, who was\u0014\none year older than Joseph, was a beautiful and self-contained \nschoolteacher who kept herself aloof\u0014\nfrom Joseph. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Emma's coolness, Joseph took a job as a farmhand just over \nthe border in New York State,\u0014\nwithin walking distance of the Hale house in Pennsylvania. In his \nspare time he attended school to\u0014\nimprove his skill in reading and writing, very likely so that he \nwould seem a worthier suitor to a\u0014\nschoolteacher. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Joseph persisted in his courting of Emma, she gradually yielded to \nhis ardor. But when Joseph\u0014\nasked her father for Emma's hand in marriage, he was brusquely \nrefused. Mr. Isaac Hale had been\u0014\none of the original diggers for treasure under Joseph's direction, \nand one of the first to lose\u0014\nconfidence in the young diviner. He considered Joseph to be an \narrogant, fraudulent, and lazy\u0014\nyoung man, totally unworthy to marry his daughter. After being turned \ndown by Isaac Hale, Joseph\u0014\ncontinued to visit his daughter while Isaac was away on frequent and \nextended hunting trips. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the spring of 1826, some of the former treasure-hunters brought \nlegal charges against Joseph in\u0014\nthe court at Bainbridge, New York. Joseph was accused of \"disorderly \nconduct\" and also of being an\u0014\n\"impostor.\" One of the witnesses testifying against him was his \nsweetheart's father, Isaac Hale.\u0014\nJoseph was found guilty on both charges. There is no record of the \nsentence imposed on him. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite this public humiliation which was aided and abetted by her \nfather, Emma Hale remained\u0014\nattracted to Joseph. In January 1827, when Joseph was twenty-one, he \nsucceeded in persuading\u0014\nEmma to elope with him. After getting married in New York State, they \nwent to live with Joseph's\u0014\nparents in Palmyra. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the fall of 1827, Joseph and Emma returned to her parents' home in \nPennsylvania to pick up her\u0014\nbelongings. There was an emotional meeting between Isaac Hale and his \nson-in-law, in which Isaac accused Joseph of having stolen his \ndaughter. Amid tears, Joseph asked his father-in-law for\u0014\nforgiveness. Joseph promised to lead a more honest and responsible \nlife, and to be a worthy\u0014\nhusband to Emma. Isaac seemed reassured by Joseph's contrition, and \noffered to give the young\u0014\ncouple a small house on his property. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph and Emma moved into the small house, and Isaac expected that \nJoseph would help with the\u0014\nwork on his farm. Instead, Joseph kept himself occupied with some \nmysterious indoor activity. One\u0014\nday Isaac decided to investigate what was going on in the small \nhouse, and paid a visit to his son-\u0014\nin-law. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac found Joseph sitting at a table with a hat over his face, \nuttering long Biblical phrases. Emma\u0014\nsat behind a curtain, hidden from Joseph, while she wrote down the \nwords Joseph was speaking. On the table-top in front of Joseph sat \nsome square object concealed by a cloth. When Joseph removed his hat \nfrom his face, Isaac could see two stones in the hat, similar to the \nstones Joseph had used in divining the location of the \"buried \nSpanish treasure.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAlarmed, Isaac demanded an explanation of this strange activity. The \nexplanation that Joseph and\u0014\nEmma gave him only alarmed Isaac more. They told Isaac that Joseph \nhad seen a vision of an angel\u0014\nback in Palmyra. The angel had led Joseph to a place which Joseph \ncalled Cumorah, a hill near\u0014\nPalmyra. There, digging in the spot the angel indicated, Joseph had \nfound a set of golden plates\u0014\ncomprising a holy book, called the Book of Mormon. The book was \nwritten in symbols which Joseph\u0014\ncalled \"reformed Egyptian,\" but with the gold plates were two stones, \nwith which Joseph could\u0014\ndecipher the ancient symbols on the gold plates . \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph told Isaac that the gold plates were right in front of them on \nthe table, in a box covered by a\u0014\ncloth. It was not necessary for Joseph to see the plates in order to \ndecipher them. He could read the\u0014\nplates, understand them, and translate them into English, by gazing \ninto the stones. However, in\u0014\norder to see into the stones, he had to shut out all extraneous \nlight. Therefore, he put the stones into\u0014\nhis hat and covered his face with the hat. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Isaac asked to see the golden plates, Joseph refused permission. \nJoseph said that, if anyone\u0014\nbesides himself looked at the golden plates, it would mean instant \ndeath for the person. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo far as Isaac could tell, no change had occurred in Joseph since \nhis treasure-hunting days. Isaac\u0014\nlater said, \"The manner in which he pretended to read and interpret \nwas the same as when he looked for the money-diggers, with the stones \nin his hat, and his hat over his face.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac failed to notice that, although Joseph's occult techniques had \nnot changed, the purpose of\u0014\nJoseph's life had taken a new direction. Formerly, Joseph had been \nlooking for gold. Now, he\u0014\nseemed indifferent to money. As described by Joseph, the gold plates \nhe had found at Cumorah\u0014\nwere worth millions of dollars; yet Joseph valued only the message \nengraved on them. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac felt certain that there were no gold plates, and that Joseph \nwas plotting some elaborate fraud.\u0014\nBut Emma remained loyal to her husband, dutifully taking down \nJoseph's dictation, hour after hour,\u0014\nday after day. The words Joseph spoke through his hat told the story \nof Jewish families which had\u0014\nmigrated to America from Israel in the seventh century before Christ, \nbecoming the ancestors of the\u0014\nAmerican Indians. According to the scriptures which Joseph was \ntranslating, Christ himself had\u0014\ncome to America before his ascension. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his work of translation, Joseph received some financial \nsupport from a few acquaintances\u0014\nwho believed in the importance of his task. One man mortgaged his \nfarm to support Joseph. The\u0014\nman's wife, who considered Joseph's scriptures a hoax, was so \nincensed that she left her husband. \u0014\n\u0014\nEmma worked as Joseph's secretary until the summer of 1828, when she \ngave birth to a son who\u0014\nsurvived for only a few hours. Emma was so depressed by the death of \nher firstborn that Joseph was\u0014\ndeeply worried about her. To give Emma a rest, he called in one of \nhis supporters to serve as his\u0014\nscribe, and Emma regained her health and stability. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe following year 1829, the second secretary was replaced by a \nthird. Finally, in 1830, the work of\u0014\ntranslation was completed. Joseph was now twenty-four years old, and \nhad spent two and a half\u0014\nyears translating the Book of Mormon. He had dictated a total of \n275,000 words. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis translation complete, Joseph had one further use of the golden \nplates. To assure skeptics that the plates did, indeed, exist, he \nshowed them to several trusted witnesses, who signed statements\u0014\naffirming that they had beheld the plates. In preparation for viewing \nthe plates, the chosen witnesses\u0014\nprayed for several hours. After lengthy praying, one witness reported \nthat he saw only an empty box.\u0014\nJoseph sent him out for additional prayer, after which the golden \nplates were fully visible to the\u0014\nwitness. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph later announced that he had returned the plates to the angel \nwho had first led him to them.\u0014\nThe angel took them off to eternity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe manuscript of the translation then went to a printer in Palmyra. \nOn March 25, 1830, the Book of\u0014\nMormon went on sale in the bookstore in Palmyra. A week later the \nbook was reviewed in the\u0014\nnewspapers of Rochester, New York, under the headlines: \"Blasphemy!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLeaders of established churches were, in general, shocked by the \nemendations of the Bible that\u0014\nwere contained in the Book or Mormon. But many people/living in \nwestern New York State were\u0014\nfascinated by the Mormon narratives, which tied together their \nreligious and patriotic sentiments.\u0014\nUtilizing the popular theory that the Indians were the descendants of \nthe lost tribes of Israel, the Book\u0014\nof Mormon incorporated the history of the western hemisphere within \nBiblical history. The entire book\u0014\nwas written in the style of the King James Version of the Bible and \nabounded with phrases like, \"And\u0014\nit came to pass...\" Judeo-Christian and American traditions were \nwelded in the Book of Mormon, in\u0014\nwhich America's \"fruited plain\" was an extension of the Holy Land. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore and during Joseph's time, western New York State had seethed \nwith religious ferment.\u0014\nFantastic religious sects had arisen and briefly flowered there. Camp \nmeetings, with their unbridled\u0014\nexhibitions, had been frequent. Seasoned evangelists tended to avoid \nwestern New York State\u0014\nbecause they considered it \"burnt over territory.\" Its inhabitants \nhad participated in so many revivals\u0014\nthat they had become jaded with religious ecstasy. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were weary of agonizing guilt and had lost faith in the healing \npower of Christ's sacrifice.\u0014\nWestern New York was ripe for a new religious message, and for many \nthat message was contained in the Book of Mormon. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral days after the publication of the Book of Mormon, Joseph \norganized his first congregation of\u0014\nthe Mormon church. Among the converts who were baptized by total \nimmersion in Lake Seneca were\u0014\nhis parents and brothers. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph and Emma traveled back to her parents' neighborhood in the \nSusquehanna Valley, where\u0014\nthey made some converts. But they did not convert any of his former \nassociates in treasurehunting.\u0014\nJoseph's father-in-law, Isaac Hale, thought that Joseph was the same \ncharlatan as before, and was\u0014\nmerely practicing a new confidence game. With the encouragement of \nthe local Presbyterian\u0014\nminister, Joseph was once more put on trial on the charge of \n\"disorderly conduct.\" After the trial,\u0014\nJoseph and Emma left the Susquehanna Valley. Emma would never see her \nparents again. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite setbacks, the church grew and spread. Mormonism had distinct \nadvantages over\u0014\nconventional churches; it had its own unique scriptures and its own \nliving prophet, who had brought\u0014\nits sacred writings down from Cumorah Mount, as Moses had brought the \nten commandments down\u0014\nfrom Sinai. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph, whose powers as a writer had increased as he translated the \nBook of Mormon, now grew as an orator. Unlike the evangelists with \nwhom he was competing for souls, he did not terrify his\u0014\naudiences with vivid pictures of hellfire; in fact, Joseph's sermons \nwere punctuated with humor. His\u0014\naudiences laughed more than they quaked. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe held out for his converts not the dangers of hell but the likely \nprospect of eternal bliss. Heaven\u0014\nwas not hard to attain. Ordinary sinners like blasphemers and \nadulterers would not go to hell. It was\u0014\ntrue that frequent sinners would not go to the luxurious and carefree \nabode of the saintly, but the\u0014\nheaven of sinners would be comfortable enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph taught that every person contained some divinity which could \nbe augmented indefinitely,\u0014\ntransforming the human into a god. Each person who wanted such \nexalted status could one day\u0014\nbecome master or mistress of one of the many stars in the firmament. \nThere were plenty of stars in\u0014\nGod's creation to go around. For many people, Joseph was a welcome \nrelief from the itinerant\u0014\nfire-and-brimstone evangelists. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the early fall of 1830 there was only one person whom Joseph \nwanted to convert who had still not\u0014\njoined his church. That holdout was his wife, Emma. Why Emma refused \nto join Joseph's church for\u0014\nsix months we do not know, just as we do not know whether she \nbelieved in the existence of the\u0014\ngolden tablets. It was, of course, embarrassing for Joseph to be \nproselytizing for his new church\u0014\nwhile he was unable to win the soul of his own wife. Under \nconsiderable pressure from Joseph, the\u0014\nwoman who had recorded the first words of the Book of Mormon finally \nbecame a Mormon herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe membership of the Mormon church was significantly increased in \n1831, when a preacher in\u0014\nanother denomination in Kirtland, Ohio, converted and took his entire \ncongregation with him into the\u0014\nMormons. The church in Kirtland grew so rapidly that it became the \nlargest center of Mormons in the\u0014\ncountry. Joseph and his elders moved the headquarters of the new \nnational church to Kirtland, from\u0014\nwhere Joseph exerted a tight control over his rapidly expanding \nmovement. Joseph announced new\u0014\npolicies for the church as revelations which he had received direct \nfrom God. \u0014\n\u0014\nMormons were hard workers and their communities prospered. The \neconomy in Kirtland was at first\u0014\ncommunistic, like that of the early Christians. When communism proved \nitself impractical the\u0014\nMormons returned to free enterprise, with members paying one-tenth of \ntheir incomes to the church\u0014\nas tithes. Eventually a temple was built in Kirtland, an \narchitectural gem which was the grandest\u0014\nbuilding in the west. The Mormons' prosperity was consistent with \nJoseph's theology: the Kingdom of\u0014\nGod, he taught, was to prevail not only in heaven but on earth, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite their affluence, the Mormons were continually suffering abuse \nfrom their non-Mormon\u0014\nneighbors, whom the Mormons called \"gentiles.\" The Mormon beliefs \nstruck many gentiles as being\u0014\nstrange, distant from the mainstream of American life. The Mormons' \nserene assurance of the\u0014\ncorrectness of their beliefs impressed the gentiles as being smug. \nJoseph once said, \"Truth is\u0014\nMormonism. God is the author of it.\" A whispering campaign against \nthe Mormons was concerned\u0014\nlargely with what gentiles considered the bizarre sexual practices of \nthe Mormons. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph began to plan for an earthly paradise for Mormons that would \nbe far removed from people of\u0014\nother faiths. In 1832 Joseph was tarred and feathered by a gentile \nmob near Kirtland. The fury of the\u0014\nmob was ignited by rumors that Joseph had made sexual advances to a \nseventeen-year-old girl. The\u0014\nattack on his person intensified Joseph's determination to establish \na Mormon utopia far away from\u0014\nthe gentiles. The Mormon's new home, with its ideal society, would be \ncalled Zion. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Joseph placed his hope for Zion in Missouri. Although Joseph \nhimself remained in Ohio\u0014\nduring the middle 1830's, other Mormons settled in Independence, \nMissouri, then a frontier town. As\u0014\nsoon as the Mormons were settled and had begun to thrive in \nIndependence, however, gentiles\u0014\nbegan to harass them and drove them out of town. A new Mormon \nsettlement outside of\u0014\nIndependence was also harried, forcing a flight to a completely new \nsettlement in Missouri, which the\u0014\nMormons named Far West. Joseph, still maintaining his headquarters in \nKirtland, Ohio, began\u0014\nreferring to Far West as Zion. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Far West was attacked by the gentiles, Joseph decided that the \nMormons had taken enough\u0014\npunishment. He organised a company of armed Mormons in Ohio and \nmarched at their head to\u0014\ndefend their beleagured brethren in Missouri. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time the small Mormon fighting force arrived in Missouri, \nhowever, the gentiles had called out\u0014\nthe Missouri state militia and were waiting to do battle. Joseph was \noutnumbered ten-to-one and saw at once that a shoot-out with the \nMissourians would be suicidal for him and his men. He capitulated. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Joseph's surrender, he was charged with treason for appearing \nin Missouri in command of\u0014\nan armed force, and was also charged with plotting the murder of a \nMissouri gentile killed in a\u0014\nskirmish with Mormons. While Joseph was in jail awaiting trial, \ngentiles attacked Far West and drove\u0014\nthe Mormons east toward the Mississippi River. \u0014\n\u0014\nFifteen thousand Mormons crossed the Mississippi into Illinois in \n1839. There they were most\u0014\nunexpectedly welcomed by politicians of both the Whig and Democratic \npersuasions, who hoped the\u0014\nMormons would vote their way in the next elections. Joseph got out of \nhis Missouri jail by bribing the\u0014\nsheriff with a jug of whiskey and eight hundred dollars, then joined \nthe last straggling Mormon\u0014\nrefugees from Missouri in their retreat to Illinois. He was \nthirty-three years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Illinois, Joseph became mayor of a new Mormon town called Nauvoo. \nThanks to the eagerness of\u0014\nIllinois politicians to win the Mormon vote, he was commissioned as a \nlieutenant general in command of the Nauvoo militia. He delighted in \nwearing his general's uniform and reviewing his troops . In 1844, at \nage thirty-eight, he announced his candidacy for the office of the \nPresident of the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nOutwardly, Joseph's troubles seemed to be over, but appearances were \ndeceiving. Despite his titles,\u0014\ngaudy uniforms, and vaulting political ambitions, Joseph was standing \non a very shaky foundation.\u0014\nHis position was weakest within his own church. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll his life, Joseph had a tendency to quarrel with his closest \nfriends, who then became his bitter\u0014\nenemies. As a young treasure-hunter, he had made lifelong foes of the \nmen who had helped him dig\u0014\nfor treasure. After translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph had a \nseries of close friends and\u0014\ncolleagues who worked with him in building the Mormon church. After a \nlimited time of cooperation,\u0014\nhowever, Joseph quarreled with each friend. The former friend either \nleft the church or was\u0014\nexcommunicated from it by Joseph. Outside the church, these former \nfriends circulated malicious\u0014\nrumors about Joseph among the gentiles. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with breaks in his relationships with ecclesiastical \ncolleagues, a rift grew between Joseph and\u0014\nhis wife, Emma. Although Emma continued to live with Joseph and bear \nhim children, a problem\u0014\narose between them in the 1830's which was never resolved. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat problem was Joseph's pursuit of other women. Ever since Joseph \nhad founded the Mormon\u0014\nchurch, his status as a prophet had brought him the adoration of his \nfollowers, including many\u0014\nattractive women. Seducing Mormon women was easy for him, and was \napparently irresistible to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs much as she was able, Emma tried to ignore Joseph's infidelities \nand pretended they had not\u0014\nhappened. But once when she caught Joseph embracing a woman whom Emma \nconsidered her\u0014\ngood friend, Emma lost control of herself and attacked the woman with \na broomstick. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is evidence that Joseph started to think about making plural \nmarriage a moral practice within\u0014\nhis church as early as 1831, one year after the church was founded. \nHe knew, however, how\u0014\nshocking such a practice would be not only to many Mormons, but to \nthe gentiles also. He intended\u0014\nto postpone the announcement of the new practice until people were \nmore ready to accept it.\u0014\nMeanwhile, he let a few trusted colleagues know that plural marriage \nhad been sanctioned by God in\u0014\na special revelation to Joseph. God, said Joseph, was no more opposed \nto polygamy in 1831 than\u0014\nHe had been in the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who all had \nlarge harems. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, although Joseph had not announced God's sanction of plural \nmarriage to the entire\u0014\nchurch, Joseph himself was practising it. He proposed what he called \n\"celestial\" marriage to a\u0014\nnumber of women, some of whom were already legally married to other \nmen. Joseph considered\u0014\ncelestial marriages to be on a higher plane than earthly marriages, \nlasting forever, and taking\u0014\nprecedence over mundane marriages. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly polygamy - the custom of one man taking multiple wives was \nsanctioned. Women were not\u0014\nallowed to have more than one husband. Joseph taught that a woman's \npossibility of entering heaven depended largely on the worthiness of \nher husband, rather than on her own worthiness. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph mentioned his revelation about plural marriages to Emma, \nshe was beside herself with rage. She had helped him translate the \nBook of Mormon and had never asked to see his gold plates. She had \nborne him children. She had scraped tar and feathers from his naked \nand bruised body.But she was not going to bless her husband's \npractice of polygamy. He might have God's permission to sleep with \nother women, but he would never get her permission. She begged him to \nrenounce the new doctrine. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than one former colleague with whom Joseph fell out was the \nhusband, brother, or father of a\u0014\nwoman to whom Joseph had proposed celestial marriage. In 1844 a major \nschism occurred among\u0014\nthe Mormons of Nauvoo which resulted directly from Joseph's proposals \nof marriage to the wives of\u0014\nseveral leaders of the church. The husbands who felt wronged by their \nprophet challenged Joseph's\u0014\nleadership of the church, bought a printing press, and issued a \ndissident Mormon newspaper with\u0014\neditorials attacking Joseph's policies. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph ordered his followers to destroy the printing press of his \nopponents. After the press was\u0014\nwrecked, the governor of Illinois charged Joseph with violating the \nFirst Amendment of the\u0014\nConstitution of the United States, and ordered his arrest. The state \nmilitia marched to Nauvoo and\u0014\ntook Joseph into custody. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe governor did not send the militia because, he expected mass \nresistance by the Mormons to\u0014\nJoseph's own protection. The governor feared that, if peace officers \ntried to conduct Joseph to jail,\u0014\ngentile mobs would overwhelm the lawmen in order to lynch Joseph. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe militia conducted Joseph to the jail in Carthage, Illinois, and \nlocked him up with other loyal\u0014\nMormon leaders in a cell on the second floor. The militia was \nstationed outside the jail to guard it. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the second day of Joseph's imprisonment, other militiamen who had \nbeen dismissed by the\u0014\ngovernor, marched into Carthage. Their faces were painted to conceal \ntheir identities. They were\u0014\nobviously about to commit some mayhem. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the disguised militiamen approached the jail, the guards on duty \ndid nothing to impede their\u0014\nprogress. As they mounted the steps of the jail, the vigilantes fired \nseveral shots. Joseph, who had a\u0014\nsix-shooter, opened fire on the first vigilantes to reach the second \nfloor. He wounded several of the\u0014\nattackers: then his pistol was emptied. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the vigilantes came on unopposed, Joseph ran for a window. As he \nstraddled the window sill he\u0014\nwas shot from behind by vigilantes inside the jail. At the same time, \nhe was shot by their comrades\u0014\non the ground below. Calling out, \"Oh, my God!\" Joseph fell to the \nground. He was still alive when he\u0014\nhit the earth. Vigilantes standing over him put several more shots \ninto him, ending his life at age\u0014\nthirty-eight. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen his body was brought home to Nauvoo, Emma flung herself across \nit and moaned, \"Oh\u0014\nJoseph, Joseph, they have killed you at last.\"\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                              Joseph \nSmith\u0014\n                                                                \n1805-1844\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont, \nto\u0014\n                       Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph Smith Jr. \ngrew\u0014\n                       up on a series of tenant farms in Vermont, New\u0014\n                       Hampshire, and New York. Though in his youth\u0014\n                       Joseph was largely deprived of a formal \neducation,\u0014\n                       he was \"instructed in reading, writing, and \nthe ground\u0014\n                       rules of arithmetic.\"1 Joseph's mother said \nthat he\u0014\n                       was often \"given to meditation and deep \nstudy.\"2 \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Affected by the great religious excitement \ntaking\u0014\n                       place around his home in Manchester, New York, \nin\u0014\n                       1820, fourteen-year-old Joseph was determined \nto\u0014\n                       know which of the many religions he should \njoin. He\u0014\n                       encountered a passage in the Bible instructing \nany\u0014\n                       who lacked wisdom to \"ask of God\" (James 1:5). \nEarly\u0014\n                       one morning in the spring of 1820, Joseph went \nto a\u0014\n                       secluded woods to ask God which church he \nshould\u0014\n                       join. According to his account, while praying \nJoseph was visited by two \"personages\"\u0014\n                       who identified themselves as God the Father \nand Jesus Christ. He was told not to\u0014\n                       join any of the churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       In 1823, Joseph Smith said he was visited by \nan angel named Moroni, who told him\u0014\n                       of an ancient record containing God's dealings \nwith the former inhabitants of the\u0014\n                       American continent. In 1827, Joseph retrieved \nthis record, inscribed on thin golden\u0014\n                       plates, and shortly afterward began \ntranslating its words by the \"gift of God.\"3 The\u0014\n                       resulting manuscript, the Book of Mormon, was \npublished in March 1830. On April 6,\u0014\n                       1830, Joseph Smith organized The Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and\u0014\n                       became its first president. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Joseph married Emma Hale on January 18, 1827, \nand was described as a loving\u0014\n                       and devoted husband. They had eleven children \n(two adopted), only five of whom\u0014\n                       lived past infancy. During the thirty-nine \nyears of his life, Joseph established thriving\u0014\n                       cities in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois; \nproduced volumes of scripture; sent missionaries\u0014\n                       throughout the world; orchestrated the \nbuilding of temples; served as mayor of\u0014\n                       Nauvoo, one of the largest cities in Illinois, \nand as general of its militia, the Nauvoo\u0014\n                       Legion; and was a candidate for the presidency \nof the United States. He was a\u0014\n                       controversial figure in American \nhistorybeloved of his followers and hated by his\u0014\n                       detractors. Joseph was persecuted much of his \nadult life and was killed along with\u0014\n                       his brother Hyrum by a mob in Carthage, \nIllinois, on June 27, 1844. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Footnotes\u0014\n\u0014\n                         1.History of Joseph Smith, Jr., by himself, \nin Joseph Smith's Letter Book at\u0014\n                            Kirtland, November 27, 1832 to August 4, \n1835 (Church Historian's Library,\u0014\n                            Salt Lake City, Utah). \u0014\n                         2.History of the Prophet Joseph, Improvement \nEra, vol. 5, p. 257. \u0014\n                         3.Book of Mormon, title page.\u0014",

    "words": "Monday, Sep. 24, 2001, TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                Bioterrorism: The \nNext Threat?\u0014\nShould we be concerned about biological, chemical or nuclear attacks? \nNot yet,\u0014\nsay the experts. But we should be prepared\u0014\nBY MICHAEL D. LEMONICK\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the ultimate war game for armchair strategists. A dozen \nexperts gathered\u0014\nat Andrews Air Force Base for two days in June for a germ-warfare \nassault on\u0014\nAmerica's heartland. The exercise was called Dark Winter. The \nscenario:\u0014\nOklahoma, Georgia and Pennsylvania have been deliberately targeted \nwith\u0014\nsmallpox virus. The mission: to marshal the full resources of the \nFederal\u0014\nGovernment and limit the damage. But even though the players included\u0014\nseasoned leaders--former Senator Sam Nunn acting as the President, \nformer\u0014\npresidential adviser David Gergen as National Security Adviser, \nOklahoma\u0014\nGovernor Frank Keating playing himself--the situation got quickly out \nof hand.\u0014\nWithin two weeks, 16,000 Americans were infected, and 6,000 were dead \nor\u0014\ndying. \u0014\n\u0014\nDismal as that performance was, it all seemed\u0014\nrather theoretical at the time. Not anymore. In the\u0014\naftermath of the attack two weeks ago, the idea\u0014\nthat weapons of mass destruction might be\u0014\ntrained on the U.S.--not by such rogue nations as\u0014\nIraq but by rogues like Osama bin\u0014\nLaden--suddenly seems a lot less unthinkable.\u0014\nOrdinary Americans are waking up in the middle\u0014\nof the night with nightmares about poisoned water\u0014\nsupplies and miniature nuclear weapons set off in\u0014\ncity streets.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the chances of such an attack happening\u0014\nanytime soon are remote, most of the terrorism\u0014\nexperts consulted by TIME agree. For starters, it\u0014\ntakes a lot more money to build, research or steal\u0014\na weapon of mass destruction than to hijack a\u0014\nplane or unleash a truck bomb. It also takes a lot\u0014\nmore brainpower. Says Amy Smithson, a chemical\u0014\nand biological weapons expert at the Henry\u0014\nStimson Center in Washington: \"I can sit here and\u0014\ndream up thousands of nightmare scenarios, but\u0014\nthere are a lot of technical and logistical hurdles\u0014\nthat stand between us and those scenarios.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe experts also agree, however, that they must\u0014\nrethink their assumptions. The Sept. 11 attacks\u0014\ntook patient planning and training; no terrorist\u0014\ngroup had ever carried out so complex a mission.\u0014\n\"I was not at all alarmist about this threat based\u0014\non the historical record,\" says Jonathan Tucker of\u0014\nthe Monterey Institute of International Studies in\u0014\nWashington, \"but given what happened, we need\u0014\nto reassess the threat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the three major types of weapons of mass\u0014\ndestruction, biological agents may pose the\u0014\ngreatest potential threat, followed by nuclear\u0014\nbombs and chemical weapons. Here's how our\u0014\nexperts gauge the relative dangers:\u0014\n\u0014\nChemical Weapons\u0014\nRanging in sophistication from rat poison to\u0014\npowerful nerve toxins, chemical weapons are by\u0014\nfar the most popular among terrorists. That's\u0014\nbecause the raw materials are relatively easy to\u0014\nget, and the finished products don't have to be\u0014\nkept alive. But chemical weapons aren't well\u0014\nsuited for inflicting widespread damage. Unlike\u0014\ngerms, chemical agents can't reproduce,\u0014\nobserves Tucker. \"You have to generate a lethal\u0014\nconcentration in the air, which means you need\u0014\nvery large quantities.\" To kill a sizable number of\u0014\npeople with sarin, for example, which can be\u0014\nabsorbed through the skin as a liquid or inhaled\u0014\nas a vapor, you would need something like a\u0014\ncrop-dusting plane--which is why investigators\u0014\nlast week were so alarmed to find a manual for\u0014\noperating crop-dusting equipment while searching suspected terrorist \nhideouts.\u0014\nStill, to attack a city with sarin, you would probably have to fly \nthousands of\u0014\npounds back and forth over heavily populated areas--not something \neasily\u0014\ndone, especially now. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, the most devastating nonmilitary chemical attack ever, by the \nAum\u0014\nShinrikyo cult in Tokyo in 1995, killed only a dozen people. One \nreason is that\u0014\nthe delivery method was crude: cultists dropped plastic bags of sarin \n(smuggled\u0014\nin lunch boxes and soft-drink containers) on a subway platform and \npierced\u0014\nthem with umbrella tips. Also the amounts were relatively small. Says \nSmithson:\u0014\n\"Any bozo can make a chemical agent in a beaker, but producing tons \nand tons\u0014\nis difficult.\" Aum Shinrikyo tried to make the stuff in bulk, \nrecruiting scientists\u0014\nand spending at least $10 million, but it failed. \u0014\n\u0014\nTerrorists could try to tap into the more ample supplies of chemical \narms\u0014\nbelieved to be stockpiled by Iraq and other outlaw states. But Tucker \npoints out\u0014\nthat the leaders of such countries would probably be reluctant to let \nweapons\u0014\nbanned by international treaty out of their direct control; if they \nwere traced\u0014\nback it could lead to swift retaliation. \"We know Saddam Hussein is \nruthless,\" he\u0014\nsays, \"but generally he is not reckless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNuclear Weapons\u0014\nMore than 25 years ago, in an eerie foreshadowing of the World Trade \nCenter\u0014\nattack, the writer John McPhee explored with nuclear physicist Ted \nTaylor the\u0014\nquestion of how you could topple the Twin Towers with a small atomic \nbomb.\u0014\nPositioned correctly, McPhee reported, a nuke a tenth as powerful as\u0014\nHiroshima's could knock a tower into the Hudson River.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that assumes you could manufacture the bomb and put it into \nposition. A\u0014\nterrorist would first have to get hold of some sort of fissionable \nmaterial--ideally,\u0014\nsays Princeton University nuclear proliferation expert Frank von \nHippel,\u0014\nenriched uranium. North Korea, Iraq and Libya are believed to have \nuranium\u0014\nstockpiles but would probably be loath to let them go. A more likely \nsource is\u0014\nthe former Soviet Union, where bombmaking supplies are plentiful, the\u0014\neconomy is in upheaval, and security has collapsed. \u0014\n\u0014\nBin Laden reportedly tried to obtain uranium from the breakaway \nSoviet states,\u0014\nbut his sources bilked him, offering instead low-grade reactor fuel \nand\u0014\nradioactive garbage. Even if he had been successful, says von Hippel, \nit would\u0014\ntake at least 150 lbs. of uranium plus hundreds of pounds of casing \nand\u0014\nmachinery to make a weapon. \"Nobody's going to be carrying a bomb \naround in\u0014\na suitcase,\" he says. \u0014\n\u0014\nFar likelier is an attack on a nuclear power plant with conventional\u0014\nexplosives--a fact recognized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nwhich\u0014\nhas staged mock commando raids on U.S. plants for years. Alarmingly, \nthese\u0014\nwar-game assaults have often succeeded, sometimes \"releasing\" more\u0014\nradiation than Chernobyl (an accident, it's worth remembering, that \nby some\u0014\nestimates caused 30,000 deaths). \u0014\n\u0014\nBiological Weapons\u0014\nGerm warfare has been around since at least the Middle Ages, when \narmies\u0014\nbesieging a city would catapult corpses infected with the black \nplague over the\u0014\nwalls. Today the bugs authorities most fear are anthrax (a bacterium) \nand\u0014\nsmallpox (a virus). Both are highly lethal: the former kills nearly \n90% of its\u0014\nvictims, the latter some 30%. Anthrax is not communicable; smallpox, \non the\u0014\nother hand, can be transmitted with horrifying ease from one person to\u0014\nanother. \"The feelings of uncertainty, of who is infected, of who \nwill get infected,\u0014\nare the main advantages of biowarfare,\" says Stephen Morse of the \nColumbia\u0014\nUniversity School of Public Health.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the cold war, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union began \ndeveloping\u0014\nanthrax as a biological weapon. Today 17 nations are believed to have\u0014\nbiological weapons programs, many of which involve anthrax. \nOfficially, the only\u0014\nsources of smallpox are small quantities in the labs of the Centers \nfor Disease\u0014\nControl in Atlanta and at Vector in Koltsovo, Russia. But experts \nbelieve that\u0014\nRussia, Iraq and North Korea have all experimented with the virus and \nthat\u0014\nsignificant secret stashes remain. Even more worrisome are reports \nthat Russia\u0014\nused genetic engineering to try to make anthrax and smallpox more \nlethal and\u0014\nresistant to antibiotics and vaccines. (The U.S. put a similar \nprogram on hold.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever form the next attack takes, all evidence suggests that the \nnation is\u0014\nstill largely unprepared. That's beginning to change. The NRC has \nplans to\u0014\nbeef up already heightened security at power plants, and public \nhealth officials\u0014\nare beginning to get serious about staving off biological assaults. \nLast year, for\u0014\nexample, the CDC authorized a private company to cook up 40 million\u0014\nadditional doses of smallpox vaccine to add to the U.S. stockpile--a \njob that will\u0014\ntake several years. \"We also need to develop new drugs and vaccines \nagainst\u0014\nother organisms that might be a threat,\" says Dr. Margaret Hamburg of \nthe\u0014\nWashington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"And we need to do \nresearch to\u0014\nbetter understand how some of these organisms cause disease.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy not just vaccinate every American against every possible \ngerm-warfare\u0014\nagent? That would be impractical, if not impossible, and the side \neffects of the\u0014\ninoculations would pose a significant health risk. Instead, says \nMichael\u0014\nOsterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and \nPolicy at\u0014\nthe University of Minnesota, we should strengthen the country's \npublic health\u0014\nsystem. After Sept. 11, hospitals in New York City were asked to \nreport any\u0014\noutbreaks of unusual symptoms. Health experts know that in the event \nof\u0014\nbiological attack, the earlier an epidemic is detected, the easier it \nis to contain. \u0014\n\u0014\nExperts in antiterrorism share their concern. At the turn of the past \ncentury,\u0014\nsays Brian Jenkins of the Rand Corp., epidemics of diseases like \nyellow fever\u0014\nand cholera kept health workers on their toes. Now, after a decade of \ncutbacks,\u0014\n\"our ability to treat large numbers of casualties has been reduced,\" \nhe says.\u0014\n\"The notion of reinvesting to create a muscular public health system \nis not a\u0014\nbad idea, even if there is no terrorism.\"\u0014",

In\u0014\n                      principle, the business and interest groups say \nthey support a strong U.S. effort to\u0014\n                      choke off the finances of terrorists. \nNevertheless, with their own lucrative overseas\u0014\n                      dealings at stake, they are balking at proposed \nantiterrorism measures that will, in\u0014\n                      effect, curb all business in the secretive \nworld of offshore finance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"There are outside parties in the banking \nindustry who do not want heightened due\u0014\n                      diligence, and they have been trying to get \nthis out of the bill,\" said Rep. John LaFalce\u0014\n                      of New York. He voiced frustration as the House \nFinancial Services Committee, on\u0014\n                      which he serves as ranking Democrat, last week \ntackled a succession of\u0014\n                      amendments that would have given the U.S. \ntreasury secretary discretion to exempt\u0014\n                      banks from new requirements. LaFalce said he \ndidn't want to leave such decisions up\u0014\n                      to the Bush administration, which had shown \nlittle interest in tough money-laundering\u0014\n                      controls earlier this year: \"It wasn't until \nSeptember 11 and after that they saw the light\u0014\n                      on this issue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The fine print. The American Bankers \nAssociation, the lead industry lobbying\u0014\n                      organization, released a letter praising the \nlegislation that emerged from a House\u0014\n                      committee last week. But that was after it had \nmanaged to insert into the bill a\u0014\n                      requirement that government officials embark on \na likely lengthy process of writing\u0014\n                      regulations to put the law into effect.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We've asked for what I think are reasonable \nadjustments,\" says John Byrne,\u0014\n                      association senior counsel. He said that U.S. \nbanks have rallied behind President\u0014\n                      Bush's move, expanded last week, to freeze the \nassets of Osama bin Laden and to\u0014\n                      reconstruct the money trail. But, says Byrne, \n\"what we're not committed to is simply\u0014\n                      passing laws that have been sitting around for \na while in the current environment\u0014\n                      simply because the time has come to put them \ninto play.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, money-laundering legislation, stymied \nfor years by bank lobbying, moved to the\u0014\n                      fast track after the devastating September 11 \nattacks. The measure would crack\u0014\n                      down especially on dealings with banks in \ncountries with high levels of bank secrecy.\u0014\n                      In effect, the legislation would reverse the \nBush administration's pre-September 11\u0014\n                      policy of backing off from the international \nmovement to pressure those countries to\u0014\n                      change their laws. \"Money laundering is the \ntransmission belt that gives terrorists the\u0014\n                      means to carry out their campaigns,\" said \nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Paul\u0014\n                      Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, as he pushed \nforward with the package. But the\u0014\n                      going hasn't been easy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Case in point: The proposal currently moving \nforward on Capitol Hill would bar U.S.\u0014\n                      banks from doing business with foreign \"shell \nbanks,\" that is, financial institutions that\u0014\n                      have no physical offices but simply exist to \nmove money from one place to another in\u0014\n                      secrecy. Many U.S. banks already shun \nrelationships with shells, and the American\u0014\n                      Bankers Association agrees with a prohibition. \nBut, according to congressional\u0014\n                      staffers, lobbyists for giant Citigroup had \nurged lawmakers to make an exception for\u0014\n                      shell banks affiliated with financial services \ncompanies. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Because it is so easy to set up an unregulated \nfinancial service firmOsama bin Laden\u0014\n                      allegedly had one, called Taba \nInvestmentsproponents feared such an exception\u0014\n                      would render the new legislation meaningless. \nCitigroup's proposal was removed from\u0014\n                      both Senate and House bills just before \ncommittee votes. And Citigroup spokeswoman\u0014\n                      Christina Pretto, who would not comment \nspecifically on the shell issue, said the\u0014\n                      corporation \"strongly supports\" the current \nbill. \"We have been working . . . to achieve\u0014\n                      the most effective means to ensure that the \nbanking system worldwide is never used\u0014\n                      by terrorists and other criminals,\" she said. \nCitigroup has taken heat for its dealings\u0014\n                      with offshore institutions in the past. An \ninvestigation spearheaded by Democratic\u0014\n                      Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan earlier this year \ntook aim at Citigroup for opening a $7.7\u0014\n                      million account for a Cayman Islands shell bank \nwhose assets were eventually seized\u0014\n                      in an illegal-drug investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The new legislation would force U.S. banks and \nother financial institutions to step up\u0014\n                      efforts to determine the source of deposits \nfrom foreign countries. Banking industry\u0014\n                      officials have called the proposal impossible \nto enforce. Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.,\u0014\n                      banking consultant, calls it an effort \"to turn \nbanks into spymasters\" that won't\u0014\n                      succeed in nabbing terrorists. \"The bad guys \nfigure how to get around these things, or\u0014\n                      we would have won the war on drugs long ago,\" \nEly says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps the most importantand \ncriticizedprovision would give the treasury\u0014\n                      secretary power to sanction any country or \nfinancial institution he deems to be \"a\u0014\n                      primary money laundering concern.\" He might \nlimit or outright prohibit any dealings with\u0014\n                      U.S. banks. Former government officials say \nthat's the kind of clout that the United\u0014\n                      States has been lacking in international money \nlaundering probes such as the pursuit\u0014\n                      of bin Laden.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"This is a very, very deep problem,\" says \nWilliam Wechsler, a special adviser at the\u0014\n                      Treasury Department in the Clinton \nadministration. \"A simple law enforcement\u0014\n                      investigationfollowing the money trail and \ngoing to the country, and saying, 'We need\u0014\n                      some legal assistance'is not going to get the \ncooperation we need. You need to have\u0014\n                      leverage over these countries, to be able to \nshow that there is a price that's going to\u0014\n                      be paid for not cooperating.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tax haven rights. But libertarian groups, led \nby an organization called the Center for\u0014\n                      Freedom and Prosperity, are engaged in what \nthey call a \"nonstop effort\" against the\u0014\n                      measure. The center, which declines to reveal \nits supporters, fights for the right of\u0014\n                      small \"tax haven\" countries in the Caribbean \nand elsewhere to maintain bank secrecy\u0014\n                      laws in the face of mounting international \npressure. Provisions ostensibly meant to\u0014\n                      curb money laundering are, in fact, the center \ncontends, \"designed to give an\u0014\n                      ideologically driven treasury secretary \nunchecked powers to impose sanctions on\u0014\n                      economically successful low-tax jurisdictions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The center's critics charge that it is lobbying \non behalf of wealthy individuals or\u0014\n                      institutions that stow money in the secret \noffshore banking system to avoid taxes.\u0014\n                      \"You do everything the same way, if you're a \ncrook, a terrorist, or a tax evader,\" says\u0014\n                      one Senate staffer. \"If you start to open up \nbank secrecy for terrorism, these folks\u0014\n                      start to worry that the next stop will be tax \nenforcement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Opponents of the legislation say there's no \nevidence any of the proposed new\u0014\n                      controls over U.S. dealings with foreign \ninstitutions would have prevented last month's\u0014\n                      catastrophic terrorist attack.

    "words": "Review: Biblical Authority: The Critical \nIssuefor the Body of Christ \u0014\n                        by James T. Draper, Jr., and Kenneth Wheatley\u0014\n Reviewed by T C.. Pinckney (a fundamentalist view)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis small book (144 pp.) is excellent, especially for the layman. It \nis an updated version of the first edition, initially published in \n1984 during the most critical period of the conservative resurgence \nin the Southern Baptist Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe authors have a facility for penetrating the smokescreens so often \nlaid down by liberal antagonists and drawing out the true issue. For \nexample in chapter one -only nine pages -they point out that there \nare really only three basic, possible claims to truth: \"(1) human \nreason, (2) ecclesiastical authority, and (3) divine revelation.\" \nThey briefly but convincingly discuss human rea- son and \necclesiastical authority and demon- strate that each of these \ndethrones Scripture as ultimate authority, replacing it with man 's \nreasoning or ecclesiastical decisions (which are also based on man 's \nreasoning) .\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second chapter, \"The Dramatic Shift Away from Biblical \nAuthority\", Draper and Wheatley attribute the shift to four factors: \nthe emergence of the historical-critical approach, existential \nphilosophy (which maintains that it is impossible to know objec- tive \ntruth), the rise of naturalistic-uniformi- tarian science (the laws \nof nature reign supreme), and the study of comparative reli- gions. \nThe latter produces pluralism which holds that God uses all religions \nto save their devotees; all religions are valid ways of wor- ship. \nEach of these four factors is examined in some detail but in terms \nfully understand- able to the non-theologian. As a layman I \nappreciated the clarity of this discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nChapter 3, \"The Church's Historical Position on Biblical Authority\", \nmakes a solid case that Christians have always believed the Bible is \ndivinely inspired and therefore inerrant. The major part of this \nargument is comprised of quotations from well-known Christians with \nthe first being Clement of\u0014\nRome who died in 102 A.D. Clement said, \"Look carefully into the \nScriptures which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit.\" Other \ncitations take us from Clement of Rome to Jonathan Edwards \n(1703-1758).\u0014\n\u0014\nTurning from Christians in general to Baptists, the fourth chapter \noffers a selection of quotes from prominent Baptists, starting with \nJohn Smyth, pastor of the first \"modern\" Baptist church in Amsterdam \nin 1609. The chapter includes quotes from Thomas Helwys, Roger \nWilliams, John Gill, John L. Dagg, James Boyce, Basil Manly, John \nBroadus, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and B. H. Carroll. The last nine \npages (out of 23) of the chapter discuss the Baptist Faith and \nMessage as adopted in June 2000, focussing on its position regarding \nbiblical authority.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Bible Speaks about Itself' well describes chapter five, and \nchapter six, \"Biblical Authority: What We Do and Don't Mean\", covers \nsome of the practical considerations of the question. For example, \nthat figures of speech and approximations are contained in the Word, \nand that only the originals are fully inerrant, not any translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe final two chapters look to the future: \"The Next Big Issue for \nChristians: The Sufficiency of Scripture\" and \"The Southern Baptist \nConvention and Authority: What to Do Now?\". In the former, Draper and \nWheatley assert that \"The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture is \nbeing undermined in our church-\u0014\nes with three dangerous errors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is the error of adding to the word of God. ..., replacing \nof the Word of God is the second danger. ..with modern psychological \ntheory... The third danger [is] the displacing of the Word of God .. \nwhen the preaching and teaching of the Bible are relegated to the \nperiphery of the worship of the church. Each of these is examined.\u0014",

    "words": "I' m confused ...you're confused \u0014\n\u0014\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This editorial appeared in the May 24, 2001, edition \nof the Religious Herald. It's reprinted here with permission of the \nauthor, Mike Clingenpeel, editor of the Virginia Baptist news \npublication.\u0014\n\u0014\nOkay. I admit it. I'm confused.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past 22 years the self-appointed, now messenger-appointed, \nguardians of orthodoxy i n the Southern Baptist Convention have \ntrashed moderate Southern Baptists for their aberrant and heretical \nviews of the Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey accused moderates of holding a low view of the Bible, picking \nwhich passages are accurate and believable and which are not, basing \npersonal faith on subjective interpretations of Bible texts, \nbelieving the Bible contains human errors and failing to describe the \nScriptures with the words inerrant and infallible.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week I received an advance copy of \"Biblical Authority: The \nCritical Issue for the Body of Christ,\" by James D. Draper, Jr. and \nKenneth Keathley. The book is a rewrite of Draper's original work \ntitled Authority: the Critical Issue for Southern Baptists, published \nin 1984 when he was SBC president.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a chapter on what biblical authority does and does not mean, \nDraper and Keathley make several statements that, well, confuse me.\u0014\n\u0014\nTry this one. \"Biblical inspiration does not mean that the \ntranslations or editions or versions are inspired. Only the original \nmanuscripts, the autographa, are.\" Obviously none of us have ever \nseen the originals, and the earliest manuscript fragments of the New \nTestament postdate the originals by almost a century. Therefore, in \nthe absence of the autographs, the only Bible I possess is the one on \nmy shelf or nightstand. According to Draper and Keathley, that Bible \nis not inspired, only the original was.\u0014\n\u0014\nI confess that my understanding of inspiration involves not only the \nauthorship of the originals, but also the transmission of the text \nthroughout the ages, so that whatever sleepy scribes and crafty \neditors did to the text, God's word and Word still come through the \nBible I bought from lifeWay Christian Resources or Oxford Press. Is \nit possible that my view of the Bible is actually higher than that of \nconservatives?\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider another one.\" As far back as Augustine, there was clear \nunderstanding of the difference between the original manuscript and \nthe copy or edition which he might have in his hand. If there was an \nerror, it might be in the copy, but it would not be in the original.\" \nSo it is possible, imply these authors, that your copy and my copy of \nthe Bible, the only one available to us, contain errors.\u0014\n\u0014\nI thought the rationale of the SBC takeover movement was to purge our \ninstitutions, doctrinal statements and not a few of our churches of \npeople who believe their Bible has errors. Now the SBC's own \npublishing house promotes a book that implies that the only Bible \nwithout errors is one that doesn't exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to the words inerrant and infallible, try this one. \n\"The terminology can even be dispensed with. No one word is \nessential, and everyone is not required to use the same words. One \nmight choose true, or accurate, or whatever word conveys the same \nidea.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1980s and 1990s it was not sufficient for moderates to say, \n\"my Bible is true\" or \"my Bible is accurate.\" The \"I\" words were the \nmagic passwords necessary to prove one's orthodoxy. That they are not \nessential now makes one wonder whether they were essential then.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's room for one more. The authors admit the Bible employs \nmetaphor , hyperbole and other figures of speech. \"The Scriptures are \nmeant to be interpreted normally rather than saying we hold that the \nBible should be interpreted literally.\" They say, for example, that \nthe feeding of the 5,000, Jesus' miracle mentioned in all four \nGospels, could just as well have been 5,115 or 4,910 people present, \nbut that when John says 153 fish were caught in the net it did not \nmean 152 or 154.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis makes sense to me, at least until the authors say that \"the \nBible is either reliable altogether or else it is not necessarily \nreliable at all and thus may be suspect at any point.\" The authors, \nin defiance of this logic, seem about as likely as a moderate Baptist \nto decide for themselves what is metaphor or literal, precise or an \napproximation.\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, at some points Draper, Keathley and I agree on our \nunderstanding of biblical authority. Where we disagree, I honestly \nbelieve I and most moderates have a higher view of Scripture than \nthey do.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow I'm really confused. Why were moderates the bad guys~ Why did \nconservatives use the Bible to splinter our convention~ Was the Bible \njust a red herring~\u0014\n\u0014\nAm I speaking literally here, or metaphorically~\u0014\n\u0014\nNow you're confused.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou get my point. .MBN\u0014",

    "words": "Bigger than boxing \u0014\n\u0014\n                 By William Nack \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Behind the wheel of his Rolls-Royce, \ntooling north on\u0014\n                                a two-lane highway in southern \nMichigan, Muhammad\u0014\n                                Ali was heading home to Berrien \nSprings one\u0014\n                                December afternoon in 1991 when all \nat once he\u0014\n                 crunched the brakes and swerved to the shoulder, \nraising a bloom of\u0014\n                 dust from the road. Turning hard to the left, he did \na quick U-turn across\u0014\n                 the highway and slowly drove back about 200 yards to \nwhere a small\u0014\n                 party of college students, like mourners at a wake, \nstood solemnly\u0014\n                 around the raised hood of their car. Parking in \nfront of them, Ali climbed\u0014\n                 out and walked unsteadily to the rear of his Rolls. \nBack in the 1970s,\u0014\n                 when Ali was trotting the globe, there were whole \ncountries that couldn't\u0014\n                 pick Jimmy Carter out of a lineup but recognized Ali \nat a glance. His face\u0014\n                 was the most familiar on earth, and wherever he went \nthe whispers\u0014\n                 always went up - \"Ali ... Ali ...\" -- as crowds \nmoiled around him in rural\u0014\n                 villages and city streets, and the world's children, \ntrying to get a foothold\u0014\n                 on his lap, clambered up him as if on a backyard \noak. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Now he was turning 50, and while age and Parkinson's \nsyndrome had\u0014\n                 stolen the graceful swank and unending banter of \nold, the\u0014\n                 moon-cheeked visage was still as familiar and \nseductive as ever. \"Isn't\u0014\n                 that ... ?\" whispered a wide-eyed young female \nstudent. Her companion\u0014\n                 rolled his eyes. Moments later, after fishing around \nin his trunk, Ali was\u0014\n                 observed standing on the side of the road trying to \nuntangle a set of\u0014\n                 jumper cables. Honking trucks and cars roared by. \nHands waved\u0014\n                 yoo-hoo from passing windows. A car in the far lane \nskidded to a stop\u0014\n                 and backed up to where Ali was; four white faces \nappeared, pumpkinlike,\u0014\n                 in two windows and said, \"Ali, we love you! You are \nthe greatest!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 And there was the three-time heavyweight champion of \nthe world holding\u0014\n                 the cables in his left hand while blowing kisses to \nthe pumpkins with his\u0014\n                 right. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Ali fought professionally for more than 20 years, \nfrom 1960 to 1981, and\u0014\n                 his life was so brassy and daring, so filled with \nwonders and adventure,\u0014\n                 and so enlarged by the magic of his personality and \nthe play of his mind\u0014\n                 that no one remotely like him has ever been seen on \nthe sporting scene.\u0014\n                 Dancer, poet, fighter, mime, he was sui generis -- \nthe most gifted and\u0014\n                 unforgettable athlete-performer of his time. He \ninspired the era of\u0014\n                 globally televised megabuck fights, but no stage was \never large enough\u0014\n                 for his range of expression. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"I'm bigger than boxing,\" he used to say, and he \nwas. Ali came of age\u0014\n                 during a period of social upheaval growing out of \nthe civil-rights\u0014\n                 movement and the Vietnam War, and he not only came \nto personify the\u0014\n                 turbulent '60s but also became one of the decade's \nmost hated figures.\u0014\n                 In 1964, as the world's new heavyweight champion, he \nbroke from the\u0014\n                 nation's Judeo-Christian tradition by joining the \nNation of Islam and\u0014\n                 changing his name from Cassius Clay; and then, in \n1967, he stirred the\u0014\n                 country's patriotic gore by refusing induction into \nthe armed forces on\u0014\n                 the grounds that he was a Muslim minister. \"I ain't \ngot nothing against\u0014\n                 them Viet Congs,\" Ali said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 As punishment, at the age of 25 he was\u0014\n                 stripped by boxing authorities of his title and\u0014\n                 consigned to a 43-month exile from which, in\u0014\n                 some ways, he never recovered. The ban\u0014\n                 divided his boxing career into halves. In the\u0014\n                 first, during which he whipped Sonny Liston\u0014\n                 for the title in 1964 and then toyed with the\u0014\n                 likes of Cleveland Williams and Zora Folley,\u0014\n                 he was a 210-pound man who moved around\u0014\n                 the ring like a lightweight, with darting hands\u0014\n                 and the quickest feet ever owned by a big\u0014\n                 fighter. In fact, young Ali was rarely punished\u0014\n                 for having failed to learn the most\u0014\n                 fundamental ring skills. Instead of bobbing\u0014\n                 under hooks and slipping straight punches,\u0014\n                 he used his reflexes to escape punches by\u0014\n                 moving or leaning backward -- sins for which\u0014\n                 ordinary mortals would have paid heavily. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 By his return from exile, however, he was 28, and \nhis idleness had stolen\u0014\n                 those surpassing legs and left him a slower, more \nvulnerable target. The\u0014\n                 intriguing irony of his career is that his two most \ninspired, memorable\u0014\n                 triumphs -- his eight-round knockout of George \nForeman in Kinshasa,\u0014\n                 Zaire, on Oct. 30, 1974, to regain the title stolen \nfrom him in 1967, and\u0014\n                 his 14-round war with Joe Frazier 11 months later in \nManila -- came\u0014\n                 years after he had lost his best stuff. Surely \nnothing else that Ali ever did\u0014\n                 inside the ropes was quite as spectacular as his \ndismemberment of\u0014\n                 Foreman, who had arrived in Africa with a menacing \nglower and a ring\u0014\n                 history that had Ali followers fearing for their \nman's life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Fearing no one, Ali alone was unmoved. He had been \npromising for\u0014\n                 weeks to pull off the greatest miracle since \"the \nresurrection of Christ,\"\u0014\n                 and Hugh McIlvanney, in his column for The Observer \nof London,\u0014\n                 expressed most eloquently the stunning turn of \nevents in that Sunday's\u0014\n                 newspaper, writing, \"We should have known that \nMuhammad Ali would\u0014\n                 not settle for any ordinary old resurrection. His \nhad to have an additional\u0014\n                 flourish. So, having rolled away the rock, he hit \nGeorge Foreman on the\u0014\n                 head with it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 His skills, though, grew ever more diminished \nthrough time and trial. Even\u0014\n                 in his other signature fight, the Thrilla in Manila, \nAli took 440 blows from\u0014\n                 Frazier, many of them murderous left hooks. Two of \nAli's greatest virtues\u0014\n                 as a fighter, the depth of his bravery and the \nstrength of his chin, worked\u0014\n                 their wickedness on him in the end. He took some \nterrible punishment,\u0014\n                 and that bravery and that chin kept him standing \nthere, lolling wearily on\u0014\n                 the ropes, long after the rest of him had vanished. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 If Ali was not the greatest of all time -- and a \nmore persuasive case can\u0014\n                 be made for him than for any other prizefighter -- \nhe is certainly the most\u0014\n                 important figure that the game has ever produced and \nits largest, most\u0014\n                 charismatic performer. Today, navigating the sweet \nland of liberty and\u0014\n                 religious freedom, he is as loved and embraced as he \nwas once scorned\u0014\n                 and despised. Now they gather round him in airports. \nNow they wave to\u0014\n                 him from passing cars. Now they stand back watching \nhim untangle\u0014\n                 jumper cables. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 He never did get that car started, but he gave two \nstudents a lift back to\u0014\n                 campus. As he was about to leave, the wide-eyed \nstudent approached\u0014\n                 him hesitantly, in a whisper. Standing by his car, \nAli took out a pamphlet\u0014\n                 on Islam, signed it and handed it to her. Then he \nleaned forward and\u0014\n                 pointed to his left cheek. Cautiously, she leaned \nforward and kissed it.\u0014\n                 Opening his arms, he swooned grandly and fell back \nagainst the car, as\u0014\n                 if in a faint; little wide- eyes stepped back with a \nstartled laugh. Ali had\u0014\n                 fooled 'em all again. Coming to, he grinned. And \nwinked. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 From \"40 For the Ages,\" a Sports Illustrated special \nissue September 19,\u0014\n                 1994 \u0014\n\u0014\n                   \u0014\n                  Related information\u0014\n                  Stories\u0014\n                   SI Flashback: Thrilla in Manila\u0014\n                   SI's Sportsman of the Year: 1974\u0014\n                   Ali's Ring Record\u0014",

Gates\u0014\n                         could probably buy Haiti without a mortgage, \nbut  he isnt looking to rescue\u0014\n                         a particular country. His goal is to bridge \nthe most fundamental gap separating the poor                          \ncountries of the world from the rich ones: the gap in human health. \nHis\u0014\n                         manner doesnt betray a lot of softhearted \nemotion; he\u0014\n                         rocks slightly as he talks, using eye \ncontact only as\u0014\n                         punctuation. He speaks more freely of \nstrategies than\u0014\n                         goals, and seems more moved by numbers than \nby\u0014\n                         anecdotes. But the numbers are daunting and \nhe knows\u0014\n                         them by heart. Infections that can be \nprevented or treated\u0014\n                         for pennies are killing 11 million people \nevery year. Two\u0014\n                         billion lack access to basic, low-cost \nmedicine, such as\u0014\n                         penicillin. As U.S. life expectancy \napproaches 80, some 27\u0014\n                         countries have yet to achieve life \nexpectancies of 50.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         FOCUS ON HEALTH\u0014\n                                To a man like Gates, this is not just \nan outrage but an\u0014\n                         opportunityone he is uniquely positioned to \nseize. Over\u0014\n                         the past several years, Gates and his wife, \nMelinda, have\u0014\n                         created what is now the largest foundation \nin history. Its\u0014\n                         assets stand at more than $24 billion. And \nthough it\u0014\n                         supports some programs to improve schools \nand wire\u0014\n                         libraries to the Internet, its primary focus \nis health. Nothing\u0014\n                         about the foundation is conventional. \nInstead of turning it\u0014\n                         over to a board of directors, Gates placed \nhis dad and a\u0014\n                         longtime friend in charge. And applying his \nlegendary\u0014\n                         business sense to the enterprise, he has \nhelped create a\u0014\n                         whole new model of philanthropya spare, \nlean,\u0014\n                         entrepreneurial model that employs leverage \ninstead of\u0014\n                         largesse to make things happen.\u0014\n                                 Any student of Gatess mind and \nmethods will find the\u0014\n                         strategy familiar. In his 20s, he made \nMicrosoft a giant by\u0014\n                         leveraging the power of its software, \nlicensing it to\u0014\n                         computer makers and helping to create a vast \nnew market\u0014\n                         for PCs. In his 30s, his critics argue, he \nleveraged\u0014\n                         Microsofts dominance in operating systems \nto give an\u0014\n                         unfair advantage to the firms other \nproducts. Now in his\u0014\n                         40s, hes using similar strategies to get \nthe most out of his\u0014\n                         philanthropic buck. The Gates Foundation \noften makes\u0014\n                         grants only on condition that governments or \nother\u0014\n                         nonprofits match them, and requires that \nrecipients meet\u0014\n                         regular goals for performanceor risk losing \ntheir funding.\u0014\n                         (That hardball approach has met with \ncriticism from some\u0014\n                         members of the philanthropic community, who \nargue that\u0014\n                         holding people to ambitious standards may \nmake sense in\u0014\n                         Redmond but not in places where millions \ncant read.) And\u0014\n                         experts have calculated that improvements in \nhealth care\u0014\n                         themselves have a huge ripple effect in the \npoorest\u0014\n                         countries: if parents believe their children \nwill live longer,\u0014\n                         they save more and reproduce less. That will \nhelp create\u0014\n                         capital for investment, which will spur more \ndevelopment\u0014\n                         and so on, in a positive feedback loop, as \nthe techies like\u0014\n                         to say in Redmond.\u0014\n   \u0014\n                          As you enter the Gates Foundations newly \nfinished\u0014\n                         Seattle headquarters, the term venture \nphilanthropy\u0014\n                         immediately makes sense. In contrast to the \nposh style of\u0014\n                         an old-line charity, this one is housed in a \nrefurbished\u0014\n                         check-processing plant that abuts a working \ndock on Lake\u0014\n                         Union. There is no imposing nameplate on the \nbuilding,\u0014\n                         just a street number. The interior is all \nclean lines;\u0014\n                         up-to-the-minute workstations sport dockable \nlaptops. In\u0014\n                         the hallways, junior staffers mix casually \nwith senior\u0014\n                         officers and global health experts. The only \nnecktie on the\u0014\n                         premises belongs to Dr. Gordon Perkin, the \nphysician and\u0014\n                         family-planning expert who directs the \nfoundations global\u0014\n                         health program. But no one is in retirement \nmodenot\u0014\n                         even the nearly seven-foot-tall \npaterfamilias Bill Gates Sr.,\u0014\n                         a retired lawyer who serves as the \nfoundations CEO. Patty\u0014\n                         Stonesifer, the former Microsoft executive \nwho co-chairs\u0014\n                         the foundation with Bill Sr., is under 50 \nbut works full time\u0014\n                         without a salary, having cashed out enough \nMicrosoft\u0014\n                         stock to live on. Joe Cerrell, the \nfoundations public-affairs\u0014\n                         director, worked in the Clinton White House \nas an aide to\u0014\n                         Al Gore, but says nothing he did there had \nthe intensity of\u0014\n                         this missionor the sense of possibility.\u0014\n                                 Its little wonder. The whole staff \nincludes only 216\u0014\n                         people, and any one of the foundations \nprojects could\u0014\n                         employ them all. The core health efforts \ninclude a drive to\u0014\n                         cut maternal mortality in poor countries, \nwhere women die\u0014\n                         during pregnancy and childbirth at rates up \nto 200 times\u0014\n                         those seen in the United States; a program \nto expand\u0014\n                         access to traditional childhood vaccines in \n74 countries;\u0014\n                         an effort to speed the introduction of new \nvaccines in the\u0014\n                         developing world (high prices normally keep \nthem out until\u0014\n                         patents expire), plus initiatives to develop \nthe first effective\u0014\n                         vaccines against AIDS and malaria, which \ntogether kill 4\u0014\n                         million people a year.\u0014\n         \u0014\n                         A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE\u0014\n                                The Gates Foundation pursues academic \nsolutions to\u0014\n                         killer diseases, but it also works to remove \nsome of the\u0014\n                         absurd obstacles to health that are so \ncommon in the\u0014\n                         developing world. Even the poorest countries \ncan usually\u0014\n                         obtain the half-dozen basic vaccines that \nAmerican kids\u0014\n                         have received for the past half century.

According to protocol, for \ninstance,\u0014\n                         fieldworkers usually discard a vaccine if \ntheyre unsure of\u0014\n                         its freshnessa precaution that results in \nimmense waste.\u0014\n                         One of Perkins favorite breakthrough \ntechnologies is a\u0014\n                         three-cent sticker containing a polymer that \ndarkens in\u0014\n                         response to heat, enabling anyone to tell \nwhether the\u0014\n                         contents of a vial are spoiled.

In\u0014\n                         Indonesia, where a lot of babies are exposed \nto hepatitis B\u0014\n                         during birth, you can have midwives immunize \nthem right\u0014\n                         away. It stops the infection.\u0014\n                                 How did Bill Gates become so \ndedicated to world\u0014\n                                 health? Many people find it \nsurprising, if not suspicious,\u0014\n                         that the cold-eyed supernerd who built \nMicrosoft would\u0014\n                         focus so intently on the plight of women and \nchildren in the\u0014\n                         Third World. Critics accused him of taking \nup charity to\u0014\n                         soften his image during the governments \nantitrust lawsuit\u0014\n                         against Microsoft, but that ended and his \nresolve has not\u0014\n                         faded. In truth, his family and friends say \nGatess new\u0014\n                         mission is not a departure but an extension \nof two forces\u0014\n                         that were there all along: his familys \nlongstanding\u0014\n                         involvement in philanthropy, and his own \npassion for\u0014\n                         high-stakes investing and problem-solving.\u0014\n                                 It did take a nudge to get him \nstarted. During the late\u0014\n                         80s and early 90s, as Microsoft became a \nbehemoth, the\u0014\n                         pressure to give something back was \nenormous. But\u0014\n                         young Bill was content to ignore it. His \nmother and I were\u0014\n                         always pushing and prodding about doing the \nappropriate\u0014\n                         thing in terms of good citizenship, recalls \nhis father, who\u0014\n                         along with Gatess late mother, Mary Maxwell \nGates, was\u0014\n                         active in Seattle-area civic activities. \nThe consistent\u0014\n                         answer was, Mother, Mother, Ive got a \ncompany to run.\u0014\n                         The best thing I can do for the community is \nto have this\u0014\n                         business succeed. Concerned that too many \npleas were\u0014\n                         going unanswered, Bill Sr. eventually \nvolunteered to keep\u0014\n                         track of the mail and send out responses.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                         OTHER POSSIBILITIES\u0014\n                                By 1994, that errand had blossomed \ninto a full-time\u0014\n                         job, and the father had persuaded Bill and \nMelinda to\u0014\n                         consolidate a growing patchwork of \ncharitable efforts by\u0014\n                         forming a foundation. Bill Sr. and \nStonesifer signed on as\u0014\n                         co-chairshe acting as CEO, she as \npresidentand they\u0014\n                         started meeting regularly with Bill and \nMelinda to thrash\u0014\n                         out possibilities for doing good. Entrusted \nwith a modest\u0014\n                         $94 million, they focused at first on \ngetting computers into\u0014\n                         schools and libraries (an effort sometimes \ncriticized for\u0014\n                         helping expand the software market). But \nBill Sr.\u0014\n                         encouraged the couple to think about other \npossibilities,\u0014\n                         and in 1998 they stumbled onto health.\u0014\n                                 For Bill Jr., the impetus was a \ncompelling set of\u0014\n                         statistics. Stonesifer describes Melinda as \na see it, touch\u0014\n                         it, feel it person, Bill as an academic \nlearner who was\u0014\n                         shocked by a 1998 newspaper article \ndocumenting the\u0014\n                         discrepancies in income, health care and \nlife expectancy in\u0014\n                         different parts of the world. Poor countries \nwere carrying\u0014\n                         90 percent of the worlds disease burden but \nreceiving\u0014\n                         only 10 percent of its health resources. And \nthese\u0014\n                         widespread medieval health conditions were \nthwarting\u0014\n                         social and economic development.

But the Gateses unveiled a \nlarger, $750\u0014\n                         million vaccine fund a year later. The huge \npledge made\u0014\n                         news around the world, but its size was no \nmore significant\u0014\n                         than the way it was set up. Instead of \nkeeping the new\u0014\n                         fund isolated within the foundationand \nduplicating the\u0014\n                         efforts of the half-dozen agencies already \nworking to\u0014\n                         increase vaccine usehe linked it to the \nGlobal Alliance\u0014\n                         for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), a \ncoalition\u0014\n                         representing all those agencies. As GAVIs \nfinancial arm,\u0014\n                         the Vaccine Fund became a magnet for other \ndonors (it\u0014\n                         has grown to $1.2 billion). And with such \nresources at\u0014\n                         hand, health advocates who had spent a \ndecade fighting\u0014\n                         over crumbs discovered they could work \ntogether.\u0014\n                         Suddenly it wasnt a question of getting \nyour share, says\u0014\n                         William Muraskin, a medical historian at \nQueens College in\u0014\n                         New York. There was enough for everybody.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                         WERE HERE TO ACT AS A CATALYST\u0014\n                                The Gates Foundation has since grown \nvastly larger\u0014\n                         than the Vaccine Fund, but it still employs \nthe same\u0014\n                         principles. It treats grant recipients as \nbusiness partners,\u0014\n                         auditing their performance and demanding \nthat they\u0014\n                         contribute whatever they can to a project. \nGovernments,\u0014\n                         however strapped, typically have to increase \ntheir own\u0014\n                         health spending to qualify for help. And \nbefore funding a\u0014\n                         new initiative, the Gates team demands \nevidence that it will\u0014\n                         become self-sustaining in the future. Were \nnot here to\u0014\n                         feed a machine, says Stonesifer. Were \nhere to act as a\u0014\n                         catalyst.\u0014\n                                 Nor does Gates defer quietly to the \nexperts he has\u0014\n                         assembled. He participates directly in the \nfoundations\u0014\n                         affairs, signing off on each major grant the \norganization\u0014\n                         approves. And though he doesnt travel as \nmuch as\u0014\n                         Melinda, he has gained a reputation for \ndevouring\u0014\n                         immunology texts and development reports \nduring family\u0014\n                         vacations, and for questioning grant \nproposals with the\u0014\n                         zeal of a dissertation adviser. We send him \na two-foot\u0014\n                         stack of reading material every few months, \nsays Perkin.\u0014\n                         He comes back with technical questions that \ntake real\u0014\n                         work to answer. At this point, I think he \nknows as much\u0014\n                         about vaccines as we do.\u0014\n                                 Well, not quite as much, but Gates \nhas lit a bonfire\u0014\n                         under the companies that make them. \nTechnology is\u0014\n                         created in response to market pressures, \nUnited Nations\u0014\n                         experts wrote in a recent development \nreport, not the\u0014\n                         needs of poor people, who have little \npurchasing power.\u0014\n                         Health advocates have traditionally blamed \nthe drug\u0014\n                         industry. As a businessman, Gates knows that \nprivate\u0014\n                         companies cant rationally spend their money \ndeveloping\u0014\n                         vaccines for people who have no money to buy \nthem.\u0014\n                         Instead of scolding them, the foundation \nfinances their\u0014\n                         long-shot R&D efforts and helps ensure that \nbreakthrough\u0014\n                         products will be used. The Gates-backed \nInternational\u0014\n                         AIDS Vaccine Initiative now has a half-dozen \ncompounds in\u0014\n                         development. And the Malaria Vaccine \nInitiative is pushing\u0014\n                         eight separate efforts to arm the body \nagainst the\u0014\n                         mosquito-borne plasmodium parasite.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Even with good luck, plentiful funds and the \nwork\u0014\n                         schedule of a software tycoon, these efforts \nwill take a\u0014\n                         decade or more to bear fruit. But the \nfoundation is pushing\u0014\n                         more immediate measures as well, and many of \nthem are\u0014\n                         changing peoples lives. In Mozambique, \nwhere 20 percent\u0014\n                         of all children die before the age of 5, the \nfoundation is\u0014\n                         funding local programs aimed at training \nhealth workers\u0014\n                         and vaccinating kids against tetanus, \ndiphtheria, pertussis\u0014\n                         and hepatitis B. Gates-backed researchers \nare closely\u0014\n                         tracking malarial incidence in the rural \nManhica region,\u0014\n                         using bicycles, motorbikes and handheld \nglobal positioning\u0014\n                         devices to monitor every household within a \n10-kilometer\u0014\n                         radius of the local hospital.

And beginning this \nsummer,\u0014\n                         volunteers from around the area will take \npart in a\u0014\n                         Gates-funded vaccine trial.\u0014\n                                 Saving peoples lives is sometimes \neven simpler.\u0014\n                         Three hours north of Port-au-Prince, high \nabove the\u0014\n                         coastal town of Montrouis, sits a tiny \nvillage called Ivwa.\u0014\n                         The peasants who live there coax corn, beans \nand\u0014\n                         sorghum from the rocky hillsides, and count \nthemselves\u0014\n                         lucky when they have enough to eat. The \nsettlement lacks\u0014\n                         water most of the year, so the women fill \nbuckets at a well\u0014\n                         n Montrouis and haul them up the mountain on \ntheir\u0014\n                         heads.

When the groups \nHaitian country director,\u0014\n                         agronomist Cantave Jean-Baptiste, arrived in \nthe village, it\u0014\n                         still had no latrine. Farmers were using \nsticks instead of\u0014\n                         pickaxes to till the land, and most were \nplanting seeds\u0014\n                         borrowed from usurers at interest rates of \n200 percent.\u0014\n                         Armed with little more than information, \nJean-Baptiste and\u0014\n                         two community organizers helped the peasants \nstart a tool\u0014\n                         bank, a seed bank and a savings-and-loan \nwith assets of\u0014\n                         $2,200. Thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, \nIvwa also\u0014\n                         has a burgeoning grass-roots health program. \u0014\n\u0014\n                         The Gates Charity Team\u0014\n                         The close-knit Gates family runs the charity \nwith help from ex-Microsoft\u0014\n                         employees and health and fund-raising \nexperts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Launched in 1999, the Gates-backed health \neffort\u0014\n                         employs a pair of nurses who travel from \nvillage to village,\u0014\n                         training local health volunteers who then \nbecome teachers\u0014\n                         themselves. Every Wednesday morning, several \ndozen\u0014\n                         volunteers visit the areas churches and \noutdoor markets\u0014\n                         to share the insights theyve gained. Their \ntools are\u0014\n                         humblecondoms, chlorine tablets, oral \nrehydration\u0014\n                         formulabut the knowledge they share is \ntransforming.\u0014\n                         People accustomed to blaming voodoo magic \nfor their\u0014\n                         maladies discover that hygiene and clean \nwater count, too.\u0014\n                         Midwives learn to recognize trouble in a \npregnancy before\u0014\n                         its too late to trek to a clinic. And \ncouples discover the link\u0014\n                         between family planning and prosperity. \nStatistics are\u0014\n                         scarce in this region, but when the peasants \nmet recently\u0014\n                         in Ivwas cinder-block meeting hall, they \nloudly affirmed\u0014\n                         they were having fewer babies, and seeing \nmore of them\u0014\n                         grow up.\u0014\n                                 Gates has more than met his dads \nexpectations.\u0014\n                         When the elder Gates stood up recently to \naccept a medal\u0014\n                         of philanthropy from the Carnegie \nCorporation, he spoke\u0014\n                         of being one proud father, then teared up \nas he said, I\u0014\n                         only wish his mother were here to see this. \nBut the task at\u0014\n                         hand is still huge. When world leaders rang \nin the new\u0014\n                         century with a Millennium Summit in New York \ntwo years\u0014\n                         ago, they embraced the ideal of basic health \nfor all and set\u0014\n                         a series of specific goals for the year \n2015. Some 66\u0014\n                         countries are now on track to reduce \nchildhood deaths by\u0014\n                         two thirds, as the leaders resolved. Yet the \nUnited Nations\u0014\n                         reports that 93 countries are either falling \nbehind in the\u0014\n                         effort or actively losing ground, thanks \nmainly to a lack of\u0014\n                         political will. Gates says his own dream is \nto get rich-world\u0014\n                         health conditions to be a human right that \nyou take for\u0014\n                         granted. Will he live to see that happen? \nProbably not, he\u0014\n                         concedes. But the prospect of smaller \nvictories keeps his\u0014\n                         spirits up. You cant address all the \npolitical, social and\u0014\n                         environmental issues at once, he says. But \nwith tools like\u0014\n                         vaccination you can reduce peoples \nsuffering. As health\u0014\n                         improves and birthrates decline, social and \neconomic\u0014\n                         progress almost always follow. As Gates \nlikes to say,\u0014\n                         better health is an end in itself, but it \nhas countless\u0014\n                         virtuous side effects. Its a lever, in \nother words, and hes\u0014\n                         got $24 billion pushing it.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n\u0014\n                         With Tom Masland in Mozambique and Anne \nUnderwood\u0014\n                         in New York\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                                 2002 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

    "words": "Baptist Women: Separate Spheres\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Carol Ann Vaughn   06-20-00 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The first great wave of Baptist women mission \nvolunteers coincided with the first American movement for womens \nrights, in the 1840s.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 At that time mainstream American religion prescribed \nthe role of \"domestic evangelists\" for women. Their  ministry was to \noccur in the private \"sphere\" of the home, \"separate\" from men. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 As Baptists competed with Methodists and Disciples \nof Christ for members, social roles and gender stereotypes for both \nwomen and men divided the denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Southern Baptists seceded from the national \nconvention in 1845 over slavery. When one of the Southern Baptist  \nConventions first missionaries spoke in 1851, the all-male \nconvention voted to suspend its business before hearing from a woman. \nAt that time many Southern Baptist men believed womens mental \nabilities inferior to mens, and they advocated corporal punishment \nof wives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In 1885, Arkansas sent two female messengers to the \nSBC. Male messengers voted 202 to 112 not to seat the women, fearing \nmore women would follow. The majority changed the SBC constitution to \nread \"brethren\" rather than \"messengers.\" The minority 112 men \ncontinued, in varying degrees, to support womens representation, \nshared decision-making responsibilities, and the spread of the Gospel \nby any means. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In 1888, white women leaders formed a missions \nauxiliary to the Southern Baptist Convention. The Womans  Missionary \nUnion (WMU) was led by, among others, the talented Annie Armstrong \nand Fannie Heck. Armstrong  worked closely with leaders of the \nWomans Auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention, which emerged \nwhen freed slaves left Southern Baptist churches after the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Both the WMU and the Womans Auxiliary addressed \nvarious gender-related issues within their respective conventions. \nThe WMU eventually became one of the most effective mission agencies \nin Protestant history, making it an attractive target to other \ninterests later. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 WMU named its largest missions offering in honor of \nLottie Moon, who noted that women missionaries followed her to China \nseeking the \"free opportunity to do the largest possible work\" for \nGods kingdom. Congregationalist missionary women criticized Moon for \ndemanding equal voting rights in mission meetings and decision-making.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Womens suffrage became the issue of the second \nAmerican womens movement at the turn of the 20th century. \nSignificantly for Baptists, this wave of Feminism in America \ncoincided with the rise of 20th-century \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Fundamentalism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 As Baptists wrangled over Fundamentalism-Modernism, \ndebates over the roles of women often took center stage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Carol Ann Vaughn, Ph.D., is director of the \nChristian Women's Leadership Center at Samford University in \nBirmingham, Alabama.

There the \nofficial from the bureau stressed repeatedly, You are not allowed to \nhave Christian gatherings. You are not allowed to read a Bible sent \nfrom overseas. You are not allowed to have private gatherings. Any \nactivity in violation of any part of the above regulation is illegal \nand counterrevolutionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nShi said, We did not shout in our gatherings. Why do you identify us \nas part of the Shouter Sect (branded as cult in China)? The \nofficial of the Religion Bureau replied, You are Shouter Sect if you \nshout loud; you are also Shouter Sect if you lower your voice \nshouting. We think you are still Shouter Sect even if you mumble \nwords in your mouth! The Shouter Sect is counterrevolutionary.\u0014\nOn April 25, 1983, officers from the Public Security Bureau declared \nthat Shi was arrested on the charge of illegal counterrevolutionary \ngatherings.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few months later, he was sent to a labor camp. He was released in \nApril 1987 after he had served a three-year sentence. On July 10, \n1989, Shi held a gathering at a nearby home in Northern Heights \nVillage. As the group was having lunch, Yang Shou-shan, Lao Yue, and \nothers from the Public Security Bureau broke in with handcuffs and \nbatons.\u0014\n\u0014\nYang Shou-shan cursed, Old diehard! It is you again!\u0014\n\u0014\nHe handcuffed him, cursing, You never repent, even when your death \ntime comes!\u0014\nThen Shi Yun-chao was taken to the Qing Feng Jail. His howls and \nshrieks under torture rang out so far that those Christians locked in \nthe jail could hear it clearly.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 10, 1993, he was released from prison.

Vernon, GA.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Union of Church and State\u0014\nJohn Leland (1754-1841), the radical proponent of religious liberty \nin colonial America, knew firsthand the evils of the union of church \nand state. His warning still rings true: \"Uninspired, fallible men \nmake their own opinions tests of orthodoxy, and use their own \nsystems, as Procrustes used his iron bedstead, to stretch and measure \nthe consciences of all others by. Where no toleration is granted to \nnon-conformists, either ignorance and superstition prevail, or \npersecution rages.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndividual Experience\u0014\nWalter Rauschenbusch (1861-1918) was an American Baptist who taught \nchurch history at Colgate-Rochester Divinity School during the first \npart of the twentieth century. Known as the \"father of the social \ngospel,\" Rauschenbusch spoke to the issue, \"Why I am a Baptist.\" He \nemphasized that Baptists \"set spiritual experience boldly to the \nfront as the one great thing in religion.\" What did \"thing\" mean? \nRauschenbusch continued, \"We are an evangelistic body. We summon all \nmen to conscious repentance from sinWe ask a man: have you put your \nfaith in ChristIf anyone desires to enter our churches we ask for \nevidence of such experience and we ask for nothing else. We do not \nask him to recite a creed or catechism. The most simple and heartfelt \nthe testimony is, the better we like it. If it is glib and wordy, we \ndistrust it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFreedom\u0014\nIn 1962, Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) delivered an address \nbefore the National Press Club. In speaking to the issue of civil \nrights, King said that there is no such thing as partial freedom. \nKings words speak to any situation where the shackles of bondage \nwreak havoc: \"We have come to the day when a piece of freedom is not \nenough for us as human beings nor for the nations of which we are \npart. We have been given pieces, but unlike bread, a slice of which \ndoes not diminish hunger, a piece of liberty no longer suffices. \nFreedom is like life. You cannot be given life in installments. You \ncannot be given breath but no body, nor a heart but no blood vessels. \nFreedom is one thingyou have it all, or you are not free.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLove Your Neighbor\u0014\nClarence Jordan (1912-1969), the twentieth century Baptist social \nprophet for race relations, once saw a tombstone that read: \"Here \nlies J. H. S. In his lifetime he killed 99 Indians and lived in the \nblessed hope of making it 100 until he fell asleep in the arms of \nJesus.\" Jordans commentary still speaks to Baptists and others in \nthe \"Southern Zion\": \u0014\n\u0014\nNow you could kill 99 Indians in Mississippi and fall asleep in the \narms of Jesus and be buried in the Baptist cemetery. But if you \nkilled one white man in Mississippi, you fell asleep in the nooseWe \nlearned to limit our love to our own race, to our own people, and we \nthink its not murder beyond that. \u0014\n\u0014\nConfessions and the Local Church \u0014\nS. G. Hillyer (1809-1900) was a prominent Georgia Baptist pastor and \nprofessor at Mercer University in the nineteenth century. In the book \nReminiscences of Georgia Baptists (1902), Hillyer described the \nrelationship of confessions to the Bible in the life of local \nchurches. He said, \"The Baptists of Georgia, from the very beginning \nof their development in this State, acknowledged no authority in \nmatters of 'faith and of practice,'\" except the Scriptures. It is \ntrue, each church had what was called its abstract of principles or \nits confession of faith. But this abstract, or confession, was \nadopted by each church, as an independent body, for itself, and it \nwas held to be valid only so far as its subscribers believed it to be \nin harmony with the Bible. In controversies with their opponents, \nBaptists never appeal to the confessions found in their church \nrecords, but directly and exclusively to the inspired Word. And so \ndid our fathers of the long ago. They were loyal to the Scriptures as \nthey understood them.\u0014",

A \nfaith statement becomes a creed when it becomes a requirement for \nemployment. Where will the next changes go?

Doctrinal uniformity has been the goal of \nfundamentalists since the inception of the so-called 'conservative \nresurgence.'

Lott, a layman from Hendersonville, Tennessee wrote:\u0014\n\"I am not and neither should anyone else, including SBC missionaries, \nbe surprised at the action of the IMB. SBC Missionaries are employees \nof the SBC, and having them subscribe to the 2000 BFM is consistent \nwith similar actions taken previously with other employees. I am \nsaddened that some SBC missionaries who do not agree with the 2000 \nBFM will have to leave their work or be dishonest about their \nbeliefs.

As a \nformer missionary (1983-1992), I have spoken with several \nmissionaries. Most of the ones I have spoken with, while they may \ndisagree with the document, will not allow it to distract them from \nfocusng on their assigned task. I believe most will sign it, not \nbecause they necessarily agree with it but because either retirement \nis too close or they refuse to be diverted from their work.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Gary Furr, Pastor, Vestavia Hills Baptist Church, Birmingham, \nAlabama, wrote:\u0014\n\"The decision to require missionaries to subscribe to the BFM 2000 \nand the aftermath to follow show us some interesting realities. \nFirst, it is clear that this statement does not represent a consensus \nof belief, as good doctrinal statements should, nor is it a very good \nconfession to guide us. Second, while I am not offended by a board \nhaving the right to require agreement with a statement, the place to \ndo it is during hiring, not twenty or thirty years down the road--it \namounts to a violation of covenant. Unless the real agenda is to \nforce certain people to leave (which seems to be the case), then it \nimplies that the IMB staff and board members do not have the \nspiritual depth, competence, and discernment to evaluate individuals \nbut must have a \"contract\" full of fine print to do it. A sad day in \nBaptist life, but not surprising.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Fred Anderson, Executive Director, The Virginia Baptist \nHistorical Society wrote:\u0014\n\"Like our spiritual ancestors I have an aversion-as natural among \nBaptists as breathing-to signing any human-devised creed. In 1783 \nVirginia Baptists adopted the Philadelphia Confession with the \nunderstanding that `to prevent its usurping a tyrannical power over \nthe consciences of any, we do not mean that every person is to be \nbound to the strict observance of everything therein contained nor do \nwe mean to make it any respect superior or equal to the scriptures. \nTwo centuries ago John Leland explained: `Why this Virgin Mary \nbetween the souls of men and the Scriptures. I question whether there \nnow is, or ever was, a body of men, who should cooly compose a creed \nof faith... but upon examining it once a year, would annually see \ncause to alter parts of it. Shall human creeds then, mixed at least \nwith imperfection, be made a standard to measure the conscience by? I \nwould not write a creed of any length and bind myself to live or die \nby it for the price of my head. In 1945 John Ellyson, the black \npresident of Virginia Union University, was asked by a Baptist \nconvention to sign its Statement of Principles and he sought advice \nfrom his white friend, the respected Baptist historian Garnett \nRyland, who responded: 'While ready at all times to state my faith in \nmy own words, I share the Baptist aversion to having some other \nperson impose his form of words on me.'\"\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTIST CONFESSIONS AND THE ATTACK OF CREEDALISM",
    "words": "BAPTIST CONFESSIONS AND THE ATTACK OF CREEDALISM J. Michael \nRobertson\u0014\nApril 27, 2002\u0014\nIn one of the comic strips in the Calvin & Hobbes series, the \ncharacter Calvin is grousing about having to write a paper on bats. \nHe wonders aloud to his friend Hobbes, How am I supposed to write a \nreport on a subject I know nothing about? Hobbes tries to reason \nwith him by suggesting some research. Calvin replies, Oh, like Im \ngoing to learn about bats and then write a report?! Give me a break!\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently Southern Seminary President Al Mohler displayed a distaste \nfor research remarkably close to Calvins. In an April 16 speech to \nthe seminarys trustees, Mohler once again played loose with \nhistorical fact. Opponents of confessions, or what the rest of the \nworld calls creeds, he said, reflect either an abysmal ignorance or \na willful misrepresentation of the Baptist heritage.\\[1] If only it \nwere so. \u0014\nTraditionalist Baptists in recent years have become accustomed to \nsuch charges. They are both baseless and careless. A brief look at \nthe real history behind Baptists and their confessions illustrates \njust how much like Calvin Mohler is.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, we have to deal with the definitions. What Mohler is eager to \ncall a confessionthe 2000 version of the Baptist Faith and Message \nstatementfunctions like a creed. Many people are indifferent to the \ncontroversy in Baptist life over the past two decades. But others, \nparticularly seminary professors, board and agency employees, and now \nmissionaries, cannot afford to be. Southern Baptist missionaries, for \ninstance, are being forced to signify their acceptance of the new \nBaptist Faith and Message statement, or face loss of their jobs. This \ncoercion, until recent years, has been alien to Baptist traditions. \u0014\n\u0014\nFamiliar to many other Christian sects, creeds until recently were \nantithetical to Baptist beliefs. A creed prescribes what must be \nbelieved if you are to call yourself a part of the group that uses \nthe creed. The Vatican requires agreement among its priests on \ncertain teachings of the Catholic Church, or they risk being \ndisciplined. Lutherans require adherence to creeds, as do other \nProtestant sects. (It should be noted that creeds have done nothing \nto promote true accountability in either the far-flung Catholic \nChurch, or to prevent fragmentation between the Lutheran \nChurch-Missouri Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. \nThe desire to control seems far more effective at doing that.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBy contrast, in Baptist history, confessions have made claims on no \none. Confessions are statements describing what an individual or \ngroup believes at a particular time about their faith. They have been \nused to protect Baptists against charges of heresy from other \nChristians by showing how alike other Christians Baptists really \nwere. They have been used among Baptists to gloss over points of \ndisagreement. But no one is required to sign a confession. No one can \nbe held accountable for signing a particular confession. Instead, \nBaptists have always left responsibility for these statements between \nhuman being and Creator.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohler, in the same speech, makes a plea for expediency in claiming \nauthority for the Baptist Faith and Message; he claims it is \nnecessary if there is to be any true accountability.\\[2] You may \nagree or disagree with him on that, but there is nothing in Baptist \nhistory to support confessions as enforcers of doctrine. Instead, \nBaptists have always followed in the steps of vehement opponents of \ncreeds like John Leland, who claimed for himself no directory but \nthe Bible.\\[3]\u0014\n\u0014\nFor centuries different types of Baptists managed to get along. \nDuring the uncertainties and dangers of the English Civil War of the \n1640s and 1650s even a Calvinistic Baptist like Henry Jessey \nmanaged to paper over differences within even his own church, and \nover as basic an issue as baptism.\\[4] In times of great distress \nBaptists at times facing the question of survival used confessions to \nexpress differences without turning on each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the same period, Baptists in London expressed their \ndifferences in confessions without leading to calls that one side or \nthe other was not really Baptist. In fact, the First London \nConfession of 1644 found the sole source of revelation to be in \nscripture, while seven years later a collection of Thirty \nCongregations produced a confession that found creation itself worthy \nof revelation.\\[5] In 1654 the True Gospel Faith confession broke \nwith the traces of Calvinism that could be found in some earlier \nconfessions and found that all believers were saved, not just the \nelect.\\[6] The First London document even takes aim at creeds \nwritten by humans:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rule of this Knowledge, Faith, and Obedience, concerning the \nworship and service of God, and all other Christian duties, is not \nmans inventions, opinions, devices, lawes, constitutions, or \ntraditions [written or] unwritten whatsoever, but onely the word of \nGod contained in the Canonicall Scriptures.\\[7]\u0014\nAt times when there was reason to emphasize how alike Baptists were, \nand how alike other Christians Baptists were, some basic differences \nwere allowed to shine through. None were forced to sign, and none \nwere excluded for their beliefs. When the foundation was laid, it was \nlaid on a bedrock of tolerance and acceptance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptist martyrs knew the consequences of not accepting creeds all too \nwell. John Bunyan in England spent years in jail for failing to \naccept the governments and the Church of Englands creed. Thomas \nHelwys paid a higher price and died in King James jail. In America, \nRoger Williams paid dearly for deviating from Puritanism. Obadiah \nHolmes was flogged; John Waller, John Burruss, and many others were \njailed, all for preaching contrary to a creed. Al Mohlers rather \nflippant comment that the church has always been watered by the \nblood of the martyrs makes good copy, but makes no effort to \nunderstand why they were martyred.\\[8] In no small number of cases it \nwas because some sought to coerce the belief of others. All too \noften, it was the supposed Christians who did the persecuting. Until \nrecently, that was never the Baptist way.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile supporters of the 2000 Baptist Faith and Message are eager to \nportray it as a revision of the documents earlier versions of 1925 \nand 1963, they are at pains to do it. The 2000 version will ensure \nthat the martyrs will keep on coming. The process continues in the \nseminaries, in Southern Baptist Convention agencies, and even inside \nstate conventions. It has destroyed churches. Now it has reached the \nmission field. Soon it will reach into local associations, if it \nhasnt already done so. \u0014\nIt was precisely to prevent this sort of occurrence that the \ncommittee that produced the 1925 version, including among its members \nE.Y. Mullins, L.R. Scarborough, and R.H. Pitt, used these words in \npresentation: The Baptist Faith and Message represented a consensus \nof opinion and was not a uniform view, and its articles were not \ncomplete statements of our faith, having any quality of finality or \ninfallibility. Confessions, they added, are only guides to \ninterpretation, having no authority over the conscience. \\[9] It \nmakes a difference whether you call it a confession or a creed, as \nthose luminaries knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as we all should know. It would prevent those who confuse the \npurposes of creeds and confessions from making attacks on people who \nhave devoted themselves, and their families, to the same cause. The \ncreator of Calvin & Hobbes, Bill Watterson, describes Calvin as a \nkid who wants everything his own way.\\[10] Other Calvins will \ncontinue to have everything their way, too, until Baptists of \nconscience decide to stand up and stop them.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\n\\[1] Trennis Henderson, Mohler: 2000 Faith Statement Is A Blessing \nand a Gift, Associated Baptist Press, April 24, 2002.\u0014\n\\[2] In the same sentence he also once again misuses the term \nconfession.

    "words": "Believing the Bible isn't 'enough,' conservative Texas leader claims \u0014\nBy Mark Wingfield \u0014\nAssociated Baptist Press - www.abpnews.com\u0014\nApril 4, 2002\u0014\nVolume: 02-27-3147\u0014\n\u0014\nDALLAS (ABP) -- \"It is not enough to say we believe every word of the \nBible to be true to be a Baptist,\" according to Jim Richards, \nexecutive director of the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention. \u0014\nRichards made the declaration in his column, \"Speaking the Truth in \nLove,\" in the April-May issue of the Southern Baptist Texan magazine. \nThe magazine and a related newspaper are published by the breakaway \nTexas Baptist convention. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"Baptist Faith and Message\" as revised by the Southern Baptist \nConvention in 2000 is the answer to this theological problem, \nRichards wrote, because it \"leaves no wiggle room for neo-orthodoxy.\" \u0014\n\"The 'Baptist Faith and Message' statement 2000 is the final \nexpression of the conservative resurgence,\" he added, referencing the \nmovement that gained control of the SBC in the 1980s and '90s and has \nreshaped its agencies and institutions. \u0014\n\u0014\nRichards' column is devoted to defending the 2000 \"Baptist Faith and \nMessage\" against criticism from the Baptist General Convention of \nTexas. Although he does not specifically name BGCT Executive Director \nCharles Wade, Richards counters what have become well-known Wade \ncriticisms of the SBC faith statement. \u0014\n\u0014\nWade, for example, has called the 2000 \"Baptist Faith and Message\" a \nnon-Baptist creed and has said he will gladly sign every page of the \nBible but not any man-made creed. Wade has championed the historic \nBaptist confession of \"no creed but the Bible.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRichards said those who oppose the signing of creeds by Baptists \nleave the door open to all manner of theological error by individuals \nwho still might claim to believe every word of the Bible. As an \nexample, he cited Alexander Campbell, who led a major schism among \nBaptists in the 19th century that created the Church of Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"To say we have no creed is to say we have no beliefs,\" Richard \nwrote. \u0014\nThe \"signing of documents\" should not be a concern to faithful \nBaptists, Richards insisted. \"When people hide behind nuances of \nwords or a perverted view of the priesthood of believers, then it \nbecomes necessary to have an instrument of accountability. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Southern Baptists expect those who receive the Lord's money through \nSouthern Baptist giving channels to represent what Southern Baptists \nbelieve,\" he also wrote. \"We should encourage and support our \nSouthern Baptist leadership who are making the difficult decisions to \nmake this happen.\" \u0014\nEnsuring doctrinal conformity has been a major theme of the SBC's \nconservative movement since its public debut in 1979. The focus \ninitially was on the convention's six seminaries, where \nfundamentalists accused liberals of hiding out and corrupting the \nminds of young ministers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe need for doctrinal accountability was sounded forcefully through \nthe years by Memphis pastor Adrian Rogers, three-time SBC president \nand a powerful figure in the movement. \u0014\nRogers quipped in 1987, while he was SBC president, that \"if Southern \nBaptists believe that pickles have souls, then professors must teach \nthat.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the six seminaries now fully in line with the desires of the new \nSBC leadership, attention has turned to foreign missionaries, an area \nwhere many moderates and centrists have continued to find common \nground with conservatives. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the new requirement that IMB missionaries sign an \naffirmation of the 2000 \"Baptist Faith and Message\" has created rifts \nin this missions coalition. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Southern Baptist Texan newspaper, a companion piece to the \nmagazine published by the SBTC, Editor Gary Ledbetter devoted his \nMarch 19 editorial to rebutting the concerns of the BGCT regarding \nmissionaries. IMB missionaries, he suggested, do not need to be \n\"rescued\" from the threat of creedalism as stated by the BGCT and \nmoderate Baptists. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jerry Rankin's request that missionaries affirm their denomination's \nconfession of faith is not insulting, offensive or even surprising,\" \nLedbetter wrote. \"A benefit of this move is that it puts our \nmissionaries on the same plane as other denominational workers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Some moderates have behaved as though it is possible to hold the \nseminaries and other agencies in contempt and still support the \nmissionaries.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThose who don't support the new direction of the SBC shouldn't \nappoint themselves as \"rescuers\" of SBC missionaries, Ledbetter \nasserted. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why would they want anything to do with SBC missions? Most of these \nfolks (the missionaries) were trained at the same seminaries \nmoderates distrust. Our missionaries were interviewed and approved \nand appointed by a staff and board the moderates now call idiots and \nwolves. Wouldn't some of that bad stuff rub off on the missionaries?\"\u0014",

    "title": "BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS WITHOUT  A SOUL",
    "words": "May 15, 2002 \u0014\nBeautiful buildings without a soul \u0014\nTony Blankley\u0014\n\u0014\nWith news accounts that the Catholic Church is turning predatory \nlegal tactics loose on the victims of known priest/rapists, it is \nnakedly obvious that the church hierarchy has lost sense of its \nreason for existing. These princes of the church should ask \nthemselves what millions of Christians ask every day of their own \nconduct: In my situation, what would Jesus do?\u0014\nWhen Jesus was on the cross he said: \"Forgive them Father, they know \nnot what they do.\" But when Cardinal Bernard Law was in deposition, \nconveniently forgetting what he saw and did, he effectively said: \nForgive me, I know not what I did (while almost certainly breaking \nhis oath to God in so saying).\u0014\n \u0014\nThe cardinal claimed in his legal brief that the negligence of a \nsix-year-old priest/rape victim contributed to his rape (he and his \nmother should not have let him be alone with a priest, was the \nfactual basis for this abominable claim). But Jesus taught that the \nvulnerable have a special dignity and that unless you are like a \nchild, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Where Jesus threw \nthe money-changers out of the temple, the church hierarchy is trying \nto cut financial deals and buy the silence of their victims.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn case the bishops think they are somehow above the injunctions they \noffer to the laity, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \n\"This work is intended primarily for those responsible for \ncatechesis: first of all the bishops, as teachers of the faith and \npastors of the church. It is offered to them as an instrument in \nfulfilling their responsibility of teaching the People of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Catechism goes on to say the Jesus' Beatitudes in The Sermon on \nthe Mount are the heart of his preaching, and of the Catechism. As \none browses through that sermon, the rape victim/altar boys the \nchurch has turned its lawyers against are precisely those who are to \nbe blessed (the pure of heart, seekers of righteousness, the meek, \netc.).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the great calamity that the church hierarchy is bringing down \nabout it, is perhaps best understood by Jesus' admonition in the \nSermon on the Mount at 5 Matthew 14-16: \"You are the light of the \nworld . . . let your light shine before others, so that they may see \nyour good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is those good works that are in peril, along with the faith and \nsupport of the church's laity. Even for non-Catholics, the church has \nbeen, arguably, the greatest endeavor for good on this planet. It has \nbeen a bountiful provider of education, medical care and research, \nfood and shelter for the poor and so many other blessings. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut just as important  probably more important  is that over the \ncenturies it has been an indomitable force for moral conduct. Both by \nits example and by its actions it has pushed a struggling, sinful \nhumanity toward better conduct. So if it doesn't soon lance the boil \nof its greatest crisis since the Reformation, not only Catholics, but \nProtestants, Jews, Muslims  even atheists  will be the worse for a \ndegraded church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd with even good Catholics in Boston calling for the RICO corrupt \npractices act to be criminally applied against cardinals and bishops, \nthere is no time to lose.\u0014\nFor someone who, regrettably, has had substantial experience at \ndamage control in the political world, the mistakes of the church are \neasy to spot. Its first mistake was the natural human instinct to \ncover up an embarrassment. At a practical (non-ethical) level the \ncover-up makes sense  if it is successful. The problem for the \nchurch, as for politicians on the run, is that they have failed to \nend the cover-up when it stopped working. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first stage of the post-cover up fiasco is the public denial. \nThis is embarrassing for politicians, but more destructive for the \nchurch  from which better conduct is expected. At about this time, \nthe second mistake is made. The politician (or the church) confuses \nhonest public criticism for the cheap shots of their historic enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe saw this in the Catholic Church response. They have been the \nvictims of bigotry and prejudice for centuries. Just as the \npolitician discounts the attacks as merely partisan opportunism, so \nthe church saw the public criticism as merely the voice of the bigots \nand atheists. Out of instinct and anger they insisted on denying the \nundeniable.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomewhere between the failed cover-up and the public denials comes \nthe third mistake  hiring the lawyers and accountants. They can \nlimit criminal or civil liability  but at the price of your \nreputation. This is a price that exposed politicians or businessmen \nare rational to pay. \u0014\nBut for the church, that price is higher than the cost of admitting \nerror. The church has many beautiful buildings, but they are worth \nnothing if they are empty. What good is a staff for a shepherd who \nhas lost his flock? (Perhaps he can beat off attacking wolves, but he \nhas lost his mission, his purpose.) It is time for the church to \nreject the Pharisees and money-changers and embrace the Sermon on the \nMount  which is what Jesus did.\u0014\n\u0014\nTony Blankley is a columnist for The Washington Times.\u0014",

By the time the Arizona native burst onto \nthe Triple Crown scene at\u0014\n                  the age of 43 in 1996 when the California-bred \ngelding Cavonnier lost the\u0014\n                  Kentucky Derby (gr. I) by a nose, Baffert had been \ngrooming, breaking,\u0014\n                  training, or riding horses for more than 30 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  His father, Bill Baffert, owned a ranch in Nogales, \nAriz., and raced a small string of Quarter\u0014\n                  Horses at the bush tracks of Arizona and New Mexico \nand in match races at places that didn't\u0014\n                  have names. \"We went everywhere together and he's \nthe one who started me,\" Bob Baffert\u0014\n                  says of his father. \"I was his groom, jockey, and I \ntook care of them. I did everything. That's the\u0014\n                  way I grew up. I've been around horses all my \nlife.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Bill Baffert dreamed of the big time in horse \nracing, but the reality of a working ranch and\u0014\n                  seven hungry kids raised by him and wife Ellie kept \nhim close to home. \u0014\n                  \"I'm living my dad's dream,\" Bob Baffert said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  He's living it large. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Baffert now has eight Triple Crown race wins over a \nsix-year period, putting him behind just\u0014\n                  six other trainers: Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and D. \nWayne Lukas, with 13 each; R.W. Walden,\u0014\n                  12; James Rowe Sr., 11; and Max Hirsch and Ben \nJones, nine each. He's won the same\u0014\n                  number as Woody Stephens. And he doesn't appear \nclose to being finished. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Baffert's done it with homebreds (Point Given), a \nyearling purchase (Pegram's Real Quiet), a\u0014\n                  2-year-old purchase (Bob and Beverly Lewis' Silver \nCharm), and now with War Emblem, a\u0014\n                  horse he bought privately for Salman just weeks \nbefore the Kentucky Derby. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In Baffert's 1999 autobiography, \"Baffert: Dirt \nRoad to the Derby\" (written with Steve Haskin\u0014\n                  and published by The Blood-Horse, Inc.), Bill \nBaffert said of his son: \"He was a natural\u0014\n                  horseman, and even when he was a kid he could pick \nout a good horse. At 12 and 13, he\u0014\n                  already had the ability to tell me right away if a \nhorse was good or not. He had great balance\u0014\n                  and broke all the horses at the ranch. You'd look \nat this skinny kid and would never think he'd\u0014\n                  ever be able to handle these kind of horses, but he \nbroke everything...Those same attributes\u0014\n                  he had as a kid, he uses now.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Today, though, Baffert doesn't have to get on the \nhorses to evaluate their ability, yet he sees\u0014\n                  things that many others do not. When War Emblem \nbreezed under Dana Barnes at Churchill\u0014\n                  Downs four days before the Preakness (gr. I), many \npeople frowned at the final time of\u0014\n                  1:031?5 for five furlongs. In fact, the slow time \nled some to speculate there was something\u0014\n                  wrong with the horse, especially since the trainer \nis known for putting fast works into his\u0014\n                  runners. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Baffert was downright giddy afterwards. \"Did you \nsee that?\" he asked one observer, who\u0014\n                  responded with a blank look. \"See what?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"He broke off really quick, going his first furlong \nin 12 seconds, so I asked Dana to slow him\u0014\n                  down,\" Baffert explained. \"He just shut it down, \neasy. After a little while I told her to pick it up\u0014\n                  again, and he did with no problem. He's really \nturning into a push-button kind of horse.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The transformation didn't happen overnight. Since \nthe speed-crazy colt was transferred to\u0014\n                  Baffert's care, exercise rider Mick Jenner, a \nformer steeplechase jockey in England, has\u0014\n                  worked with War Emblem, settling him down in his \ndaily gallops. The work is paying off. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The ultimate payday could be June 8 at Belmont \nPark. \u0014\n\u0014\n                              Copyright  2002 The Blood-Horse, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\u0014",

    "words": "It is significant that Jesus ended the Sermon on the Mount with the \nparable\u0014\nof the Wise and Foolish Builders. Throughout the long day Jesus had \nbeen\u0014\npreaching to the vast multitude. They listened to him with amazement \nand\u0014\nawe. But Jesus warned them that that was not enough. It is never \nenough\u0014\nsimply to listen to the words of Jesus, even though we may listen with\u0014\nreverent approval. If His words are to have any genuine effect in our \nlives\u0014\nwe must not only hear them but also act upon them. We must \nincorporate them\u0014\nin the events of our day-to-day living.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo drive the point home Jesus told the compelling story of two \nbuilders who\u0014\neach built a home. Standing inside these homes, going from room to \nroom,\u0014\nthere was little to no difference between. Even from the outside one \nmight\u0014\nsay they were virtually indistinguishable from one another. But, said \nJesus,\u0014\nthe foundations, one built upon the rock and the other upon sand. \nWhen Jesus\u0014\nspoke about houses and foundations he knew what he was talking about. \nHe was\u0014\na stonemason by trade and his family was most likely in the \nconstruction\u0014\nbusiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people there, listening to Jesus' teaching, understood well the\u0014\nsignificance of building upon rock verses sand. But very few people in\u0014\nancient Palestine wanted to live in the rocks. It meant grading the \nside of\u0014\na slope and hauling up materials. Living in the hills made for more\u0014\ndifficult travel. Water had to be toted and winter winds were colder. \nMost\u0014\npeople followed the path of least resistance and built along the \nriverbeds.\u0014\nThe scenery more pleasant, the water more conveniently located, and \nthe\u0014\nhouse was sheltered from the cold winds of winter. And though \nflooding was a\u0014\ndanger, most of the year the streams trickled pleasantly down the \nhillsides\u0014\ninto the river nearby.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on rare occasions, perhaps only once a generation, the 100-year \nflood\u0014\nwould come. There would be a combination of an unusually heavy snow, \na quick\u0014\nspring thaw, a torrential downpour. The result was a vicious \nflashflood\u0014\nwhich swept away everything in its path. Entire hamlets washed away. \nHouse\u0014\nafter house gone and great would be the fall.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the image drawn here in Matthew 7. It comes from the life of \nthese\u0014\npeople gathered around Jesus on that day he delivered this sermon. \nJesus was\u0014\nnot simply telling here what I call a preacher story. A preacher \nstory is an\u0014\nillustration that may very well fit the point that is being made, but \none\u0014\nthat doesn't sound very believable. On the contrary, Jesus was \ntalking about\u0014\na situation that was very real in the life of the people.\u0014",

    "words": "Booze: 'Perhaps We Should Start Being Honest About It, Too'\u0014\n\u0014\nROSS MACKENZIE\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH COLUMNIST  Jul 18, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\n              When I went off to boarding school my physician father \nsaid, \"Except for food, don't put anything into your mouth that isn't \ngiven to you by a doctor.\" The advice helped make that teen-ager a \nnon-smoker. In college, it helped him avoid the peyote, mescalin, and \nmarijuana that in the early Sixties were beginning to worm their way \ninto the collegiate - and national - culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n              It did not help with alcohol. Fraternity drink- ing \nbouts still are the stuff of legend, and even now a drink or two goes \ndown rather nicely. This rare bit of personal history is set down \nhere to inform the reader, prior to what follows, that the writer is \nnot a total prig.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the hour is at hand to talk about booze. It is insidiously \neverywhere. It's the elephant in the living room that most \ninsistently refuse to notice.\u0014\n\u0014\nYES, IT HAS been around for millennia. Yes, alcoholic merriment was \nrooted on college campuses at least as far back as the 12th Century, \nwhen a bunch of Oxford divinity students composed one of the most \nenduring drinking songs, \"Gaudeamus Igitur.\" Yes, drinking was so bad \non UVa's campus, causing student riots, that in the 1820s founder \nThomas Jefferson urged that alcohol and other\u0014\n\"vicious irregularities\" be banned.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the impression - how to quantify it even in this age of \nquantification? - is that alcohol infuses this society to an extent \nrarely seen. Advertising glorifies it. Without it most parties bomb. \nThe shelves of wineshops spill over with bottles from around the \nglobe, and \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein stores \nare not far behind. (Never mind the divine aroma; never mind the \nunique blend of barley and hops: We're talking here about\u0014\nvariant flavors of an addictive drug.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWith not much success, colleges across the land struggle to deal with \nthe drinking \"rite of passage.\" The latest effort is \"social-norm \nmarketing,\" extensively funded by brewers and others. Colleges having \ngiven up on trying to convince students that drinking can be \ndangerous, this is the nifty notion that pushing the health benefits \nof moderation (ah yes: \"drinking, the healthy choice\") is far better \nthan\u0014\nemploying the scare tactics of abstinence - which suggests nothing \nquite so much as that the game is over.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now the news columns and rumor mills are full of stories about \nthe things high-schoolers and middle-schoolers are doing as a \nconsequence of alcohol - to others and to themselves. Even as the \nexperiments in combatting this scourge proliferate, the ages of those \nusing alcohol descend.\u0014\n\u0014\nLOOK AT the numbers.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember the campaigns to combat \"binge drinking\" on campus? A major \nstudy has found that on an average day four college students die in \naccidents involving alcohol. An additional 1,370 suffer injuries tied \nto drinking, and 192 are raped by their dates or sexually assaulted \nafter drinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the culture at large, let's see: According to the Justice \nDepartment, alcohol is a factor in one-fourth of aggravated assaults, \none-third of sex crimes, one-half of homicides, and two-thirds of \ndomestic violence cases. And there are those staggering numbers about \nthe role of booze in highway maimings and deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo as everybody knows, alcohol liberates anger. It promotes stupid \nbehavior. It prevents learning. It drives its abusers down. It shreds \nemotions, it wounds, and it kills.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet we look the other way, give it a wink and a nod, tell ourselves \nwe are immune to its effects, pretend it is not there or is not a \nproblem, dismiss how it plays out in riots as \"racial tension\" or \n\"mob psychology\" or \"inadequate law enforcement,\" and respond to its \nspreading use ineffectually - or not at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd abjectly grateful parents say of their drinking children, \"At \nleast they're not on drugs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nANYONE WITH a sure-fire remedy would lead the charts as the planet's \nrichest individual.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Responsible drinking\" may be almost as much an oxymoron as \n\"responsible premarital (or non-marital) sex.\" In this country, the \nonly way may be raising the drinking age to, say, 25 - which of \ncourse never is going to happen - and getting stricter with \npunishments (as we should with even initial drug use).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is hardly an appeal for what Winston Churchill called - as he \nfamously could - \"intemperate self-restraint.\" Yet without a massive \ncultural change, which isn't going to happen either, it seems the \nnation's drinking problem is destined to grow worse. And we are to \nwince at its consequences and to read periodic observations such as \nthese from two women - the first a Yale sophomore, the second\u0014\nthe lately late author (Caroline Knapp) of Drinking: A Love Story.\u0014\n\u0014\n(1)\"A large number of undergraduates at Yale are alcoholics . . . .I \nalways have to laugh when my parents ask if anyone 'binge drinks' at \nYale, because there isn't any other kind of drinking here. A good \nnumber of people start drinking around 9 p.m. and just keep going \nuntil they throw up, pass out, run out of alcohol, or manage to make \nit back to their room with the object of their desires, at which \npoint they\u0014\nare usually too drunk even to get their clothes off.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(2)\"Tobacco has been vilified in this culture. The war on drugs is \nwaged on illegal narcotics: crack, heroin, cocaine. Ecstasy is now \nenjoying its place in the spotlight, the social ill du jour. Alcohol, \nmeanwhile, is abused by some 14 million Americans and contributes to \nthe deaths of 100,000 each year. Our culture bottles it, buys it, \nuses it, glamorizes it, needs it. Perhaps we should start being honest\u0014\nabout it, too.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BRITISH DOCTOR KILLS 215 PATIENTS",
    "words": "British Inquiry Finds Doctor Killed 215 of His Patients\u0014\nBy WARREN HOGE\u0014\n\u0014\nHYDE, England, July 19  Dr. Harold Shipman, the suburban family \ndoctor convicted two years ago of murdering 15 of his patients, \nactually killed at least 215 of them, an official investigation \nreported today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe leader of the inquiry, Dame Janet Smith, a High Court judge, said \nthe killing spree stretched over a 23-year period in which the \ngray-bearded, soft-spoken general practitioner built up a reputation \nfor attentive and trustworthy medical care while systematically \ninjecting the people in his care with lethal doses of the painkiller \ndiamorphine. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He betrayed their trust in a way and to an extent that I believe is \nunparalleled in history,\" Dame Janet said. But officials said no \nfurther trials were likely. \u0014\n\u0014\nReading from the findings of the yearlong inquiry in the hushed \ncouncil chamber of Manchester Town Hall, Dame Janet said she also had \n\"real cause\" to suspect Dr. Shipman of killing 45 additional \npatients, but could not attach the same certainty to them as she \ncould to the 200 new killings she reported. Of the 493 suspicious \ndeaths beyond the 15 for which he was convicted, Dame Janet also \nfound 210 to be due to natural causes and another 38 were \nindeterminable because of lack of evidence. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Deeply shocking though it is, the bare statement that Shipman has \nkilled over 200 patients does not fully reflect the enormity of his \ncrimes,\" Dame Janet said. \"As a general practitioner, Shipman was \ntrusted implicitly by his patients and their families.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe continued: \"Shipman's `nonviolent' killing seems almost more \nincredible than the violent deaths of which we hear. The way in which \nShipman could kill, face the relatives and walk away unsuspected \nwould have been dismissed as fanciful if it had been described in a \nwork of fiction.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report said systems that should have safeguarded patients against \nmisconduct of this scope had failed, and added that it was \"deeply \ndisturbing\" his killings did not arouse suspicion for so many years.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the 2,000-page report provided as conclusive a count of victims \nas will ever be known, Dame Janet said: \"The true number of victims \nis far greater and cannot be counted. I include as victims the \nthousands of relatives, friends and neighbors who have lost a loved \none or a friend before his or her time, in circumstances that will \nleave their mark for ever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report, a trial transcript and other information is online at \nwww.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk.\u0014\n \u0014\nProsecutors at Dr. Shipman's trial argued that his drive to kill was \nfueled by a desire for godlike power over life and death. But Dame \nJanet said her inquiry had been unable to come up with any easy \nexplanation. Recalling that he had been convicted in his 20's for \ndrug abuse, she said, \"It is possible that he was addicted to \nkilling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report turned up evidence that Dr. Shipman did seem to have a \nmorbid interest in death; many of his victims were themselves in a \nstate of recent bereavement. \u0014\n\u0014\nJudith Page, a patient of his who worked as a household helper, told \ninvestigators that Dr. Shipman once asked her if she had had the \nexperience of finding a client dead. When she said \"yes,\" he asked if \nit did not give her a \"buzz.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the report, a Shipman killing would follow a typical \npattern. He would call on an elderly patient, usually a woman living \nalone, on a weekday afternoon. Sometimes it was in response to a \ncomplaint of an ailment of some kind. Other times, it was presented \nas a routine checkup.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there, Dr. Shipman would administer the deadly injection. Most \nof his victims were found sitting in their living room chairs, \nlooking as if they had just fallen asleep. Sometimes he would stay on \nthe scene and report the death to relatives himself. Other times, he \nwould leave and wait to receive word, then return. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn every case, he would have a ready explanation for the sudden death \nand would assure relatives that no autopsy was needed. In their \nshocked and bereaved state, the families would accept his word. \u0014\n\u0014\nKnown for having a good bedside manner, Dr. Shipman could turn abrupt \nand flippant in the immediate aftermath of one of his killings. \"When \nmy mum died, he put his hand on my right shoulder and said, `I think \nI'll stay here a while in case she wakes up so she doesn't scare \npeople,' \" said Barry Swan, 52, a plumber whose mother, Bessie, 79, \nwas murdered by Dr. Shipman in 1997. \"I didn't think anything of it \nat the time, but I do now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he had just killed Mary Coutts in April 1997, the report said, \nher son and daughter-in-law asked him about the circumstances, and he \nsaid, \"Well, I don't believe in keeping them going.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHyde is a Manchester suburb of two- and three-story redbrick houses \nwith a main street of small storefronts, one of which was the office \nwhere Dr. Shipman, now 56, ran his practice from 1992 until his \narrest in 1998. Townspeople are still struggling to work out their \nfeelings about having had England's most prolific serial killer in \nthis otherwise unremarkable community.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Wagstaff, 54, whose mother, Kathleen, 81, was a victim, said \nthe doctor was \"one of the most evil men in history\" but added: \"I do \nnot think I have met anybody who said they hate him. It is just too \ndifficult to understand and try to work out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe families wonder at how they believed in Dr. Shipman. Fanny \nNichols, 84, was murdered by Dr. Shipman in 1993, but her son Brian, \n58, a retired hospital worker, said today he was so trusting that he \ncontinued under Dr. Shipman's care even after being interviewed three \ntimes by the police. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I saw the first newspaper story saying, `Hyde Doctor Under \nInvestigation,' I remember saying, `Never in a month of Sundays is \nthere any way that man could have done what they are saying,' \" Mr. \nNichols said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThough respected, Dr. Shipman was not popular. Today's report \nportrayed him as a man without real friends, someone who was a member \nof medical societies and other groups that usually produce social \nfriendships but who remained a loner. He is the father of four \nchildren, and his wife, Primrose, has remained quietly steadfast, \nvisiting him in prison in Durham. She has moved from Hyde and has not \nbeen seen in public.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the new findings, the police say there will be no new \nprosecutions of Dr. Shipman because of the impossibility of finding \njury members who have not heard of him. Dr. Shipman was jailed for \nlife in 2000, and last week the home secretary, David Blunkett, \ndeclared that there would be no review of that sentence. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Shipman maintained his innocence through his trial, and he has \nrefused to discuss the case with detectives despite their repeated \nefforts. A copy of today's report is being sent to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one here has much hope of ever getting an answer to the question \nposed by Jane Ashton-Hibbert, 35, whose grandmother Hilda was killed \nby Dr. Shipman. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I cannot reconcile the doctor I know who came to look after my \nsister and who delivered my daughter, to the doctor I know now, who \nhas caused the betrayal of trust that has affected us all,\" she said. \n\"The eternal question we live with in Hyde is, why did he do it ?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDame Janet was asked if she thought the motive would ever become \nclear. \"The short answer is no,\" she said. \"Only he could answer that \nquestion, and at the moment it seems very unlikely he will.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Times, 7/20/02\u0014",

    "title": "BLESS YOUR PARENTS",
    "words": "Preached by Dr. David M. Hughes\u0014\nFirst Baptist Church\u0014\nWinston-Salem, NC\u0014\nMay 9, 1999\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE BIG TEN - GOD'S RULES FOR THE GAME OF LIFE\u0014\nRULE NO. 5:  BLESS YOUR PARENTS\u0014\nExodus 20:12\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\tThe last thing Helen wanted to do was see her father.  You see, he \nhad physically abused her throughout her childhood.  Helen's dad was \nan alcoholic who hugged  you one minute, and hit you the next.  The \nfirst chance Helen had to leave home, she was out the door. When her \nmom and dad divorced, Helen was confident she would never see her dad \nagain, which was just fine with her.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThen, Helen's life changed.  A co-worker introduced Helen to Jesus \nChrist, and Helen became a Christian.  She became involved in a \nchurch, and received lots of spiritual nurture from her fellowship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOver time, Helen noticed something interesting about her life.  In \nsome areas, she was really growing, but in other areas, she was \nlagging behind badly.  She still had a tendency to criticize other \npeople, and she still lost her temper in a hurry.  At first Helen \nthought she wasn't growing in these areas because she didn't have \nenough faith or didn't spend enough time in the Word.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThen one day, Helen discovered the root of her problem.  The problem \nwas not a  lack of faith, or too little time in scripture.  The \nproblem wasshe was not willing to honor her father.  For all her \nChristian growth, she still hated her father bitterly for the past, \nand she had not allowed God to heal that broken part of her life.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat really concerned Helen was that she realized that the older she \ngot, the more she resembled the person she hated the mosther dad.  \nUntil she dealt with the stranglehold he had over her, she would \ncontinue to struggle in her spiritual life and personal relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tEven after she understood her problem, Helen resisted the \npossibility of dealing with her dad.  Just thinking about him ripped \nher up inside.  But Helen eventually resolved to do something about \nher relationship with her dad, because she came to see that God \nhonors those who honor their parents, and she was hurting herself \nmore than anyone else by avoiding him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhere did Helen get the idea that God honors those who honor their \nparents?  From the fifth of the Ten Commandments, our focus on this \nMother's Day.  Today we continue our series entitled The Big \nTenGod's Rules for the Game of Life.  Rule number five is, Honor \nyour father and your mother.  Or put another way, Bless your parents.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNotice that rule number five is a transitional commandment.  The \nfirst four commandmentsI am the Lord your God, and I shall be your \nonly God; You shall have no substitutes for me; You shall not take my \nname in vain; Remember the Sabbath, and observe it faithfullydeal \nwith our relationship with God.  The remaining six commandments deal \nwith our relationships with other people in light of our relationship \nwith God..\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNotice, too, that the commandment says we are to honor our fathers \nand mothers.  These days when Mother's Day is frankly a bigger deal \nthan Father's Day, honoring mothers only seems natural.  But 3,500 \nyears ago when the Israelites first received the Big Ten, it was \nclearly a man's world, and for mothers to be mentioned at all is \nremarkable.  Even then, the Israelites understood that the birth of a \nbaby involved a three-way partnership between God, a father, and a \nmother.  And to honor Dad without Mom would make no sense.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut why should this commandment be fifth on the list?  Why should it \ntake precedence over rules about murder and stealing?  What is so \nimportant about honoring parents, anyway?  \u0014\n\tThe answer in a nutshell is this: the family is the cornerstone of \ncivilization, and parents are the cornerstone of the family.  \nDishonor the parents and you've destroyed the family.  Destroy the \nfamily and you destroy civilization.  John Ruskin was right when he \nsaid that the history of the world is not the record of its great \nwars but the history of its households. God knew that for the \nIsraelites or any nation to ultimately prevail, it's families had to \nprevail.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tEven so, many of you have dreaded the sermon on this commandment \nmore than any other because like Helen, your relationship with your \nparents is less than perfect.  Even on Mother's Dayespecially on \nMother's Daywe are confused and even a little cynical about what it \nmeans to honor Mom and Dad.  Maybe you've seen that bumper sticker \nfor parents that reads, Be nice to your children, they pick your \nnursing home.  And then there's the sticker for kids that says, Humor \nthy father and mother, they haven't written their wills yet.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tEven on Mother's Day, it's hard to cover over some of the nasty \nhistory we have with our parents, isn't it?  Even those of us who \ndon't have alcoholics for parents usually have unpleasant memories of \nangry conflicts and confrontations.  How are we to honestly honor our \nparents if we are still sore about stuff from the past?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMaybe the Apostle Paul can give us some help.  Paul repeats rule \nnumber five in Ephesians 6.  Children, obey your parents in the Lord, \nfor this is right.  Honor your father and motherthis is the first \ncommandment with a promise: so that it may be well with you and you \nmay live long on the earth.  (Ephesians 6:1-3)\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMost commentators rightly point out that rule number five, contrary \nto what we may think, was originally targeted at adults rather than \nchildren.  Yes, you heard me right.  The original purpose of rule \nnumber five was to encourage Israelite adult children to give their \nsenior adult parents their due.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut Paul is also right when he understands that young children can \nalso honor their parents by obeying them.  Most of this sermon will \nnot be about how children should obey their parents and others in \nauthority over them, like their teachers. But make no mistake about \nit, rule number five has plenty to say to those kids who have made \nBeavis and Butthead their role-models for how to disrespect and \ndisobey their parents.  If you want to know at least one reason our \nhigh schools in America are in such turmoil right now, review the \nwisdom of rule number five which says, When respect for parents goes \ndown the drain, respect for everything and everybody else goes, too. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut rule number five is first and foremost about adults honoring \ntheir fathers and mothers.  Paul reminds us rule number 5 is the \nfirst commandment with a promiseif we obey it, we are promised long \nand blessed lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut what exactly does it mean to honor our parents?   The Hebrew \nword for honor means weighty.  Today, when the President or someone \nelse of great importance speaks, we say their words carry a lot of \nweight.  Essentially, to honor others is to treat them as \nheavyweights, as persons of great significance.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat's interesting is that the Hebrew word for curse means to make \nlight of. In other words, we dishonor or curse others when act as \nthough their words carry little weight.  To dishonor is to treat \nsomeone like a lightweight.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn Ephesians 6, Paul is echoing God's words in Exodus 20.  When we \ntreat our fathers and mothers with the respect due persons of weighty \nstature, we not only honor them, we honor God.  And our lives will be \nblessed because we've blessed our parents.  But if we treat our \nparents lightly, like human lightweights, we dishonor God, and we \ndiminish the quality of our own lives.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSo how do we adult children honor our parents?  This is a question \nthat causes many of us to struggle.  Does honoring our parents means \nalways doing what they ask, even if what they ask is manipulative, or \na violation of our personal integrity? Some people think so.  Does \nhonoring our parents mean never placing them in retirement or nursing \nhomes, but always moving them in with us when they can no longer fend \nfor themselves?  Some people think so.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tExactly how do we honor our parents? I have been helped on this \nquestion by a wonderful book called, The Blessing.  This book \nwritten, by Gary Smalley and John Trent, focuses primarily on the \ntremendous power of the blessing in scripture, and how parents can \nbless their children.  But there is one chapter devoted to adult \nchildren blessing their parents, and what follows comes from that \nchapter.  \u0014\n\tTo honor our parents, says Smalley and Trent, is to bless them.  And \none of the ways we bless our parents is through meaningful touch.   \nThis week I heard John Trent talk on a taped broadcast about Michael \nReagan, the son of President Ronald Reagan.  Michael says that when \nhe was young, his father would rarely hug him.  Michael knew his dad \nloved him, but his dad just wasn't a big hugger, and sometimes \nMichael wondered if his famous daddy cared for him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThese days, Ronald Reagan suffers from Alzheimer's disease.  And \nMichael visits his dad regularly now.  He loves those visits even \nthough his dad no longer recognizes him.  And the reason he loves the \nvisits is because he now gives his dad big hugs, and his dad hugs \nback.  Michael believes that even though his dad's brain doesn't know \nwho Michael is, his heart does.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome of us grew up with Moms and Dads who didn't hug.  But now, even \nthough it may be awkward, we can honor them with our touch.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAnother way we bless our parents is with spoken words of love's \naffirmation.   Today, Mother's Day 1999, will be the busiest day for \ninterstate phone calls this year.  The good news is, today millions \nof mothers will hear spoken words of love and support from their \nchildren.  The bad news is, many of those same mothers will have to \nwait a year before they hear again from their children.  And dads may \nhave to wait longer than that.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tI'm in the spoken word business.  You might call me highly \nverbal.  But I can get as tongue-tied as anybody else when it comes \nto speaking words of affirmation to my family.  I know, like you, \nthat those three little words, I love you, can be the hardest to \nsay.  And they are the ones we need to say most of all.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe also bless our parents by walking with them through all of life's \nstages.  If they live long enough, the roles reverse, don't they?  \nThe children become the parents, and the parents become the \nchildren.  I've watched my parents parent their own parents.  I've \nwatched them gradually take over their finances, place them in \nretirement homes, and manage their lives.  Even today, my father \nstill cares for his 102 year old father.  And I am awed at what I \nhave seen my parents, and many of you do for your parents.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut wait a minute, you say.  You've never met my parents.  They \nwere complete jerks, and you can't possibly mean I'm supposed to \nbless them now!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNotice that rule number 5 has no conditions or caveats.  As Dr. \nLaura Schlessinger, (In The Ten Commandments, p.144) observes, rule \nnumber five doesn't command us to [love] our parents.  Nor does it \nsay we are to honor them only if they deserve it, or we feel like \nit.  The fact is, some of us may never have warm fuzzies around our \nparents for a complicated variety of reasons.  But we can still bless \nthem if only in small ways, for two reasons:  they brought us into \nthis world; and God tells us to. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut wait a minute, you say.  My parents are dead.  And we ended up on \nlousy terms. What can I do now to bless my parents?  Plenty, say \nSmalley and Trent.  You can deal with your memories of your parents, \nwhich are likely still vivid.  One small suggestion.  Sit down a \nwrite a letter to each departed parent.  Say what you would say if \nyou could talk in person.  Be as honest as you can be.  But search \nfor ways to honor your parents with your words.  And if need be, \ndiscuss your letter with a Christian counselor.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFortunately for Helen, she got an opportunity to bless her dad in \nperson.  She spoke with her pastor about her broken relationship with \nher father.  With his encouragement, she finally decided to try to \nsee him.  From the pastor's office, she called her dad one afternoon, \nsecretly praying her father would not be home.  After the fifth ring, \nher father answered the phone.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHello, Dad?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAfter a long silence on the other end, he replied, Helen?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHelen told her dad she wanted to fly to his town and come see him.  \nHer father immediately agreed.  Four days later, still quivering in \nher boots, Helen boarded a plane and flew to see her dad.  When she \nwalked through his apartment door, she saw not the large, loud, \nbeer-drinking man of her memories, but an old, tired-looking man. \nSitting next to her dad on a couch, Helen poured out her heart to her \ndad.  She told him about becoming a Christian and how her life had \nchanged.  And hardest of all, she confessed to her father how she had \nhated him for so many years.   Then she asked for his forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBy now, both Helen and her father were in tears.  Helen's dad asked \nher to forgive him for all the terrible things he did to her as a \nchild.  Finally, four hours later, just before she left, Helen hugged \nher dad and said those four words she never thought she'd hear \nherself say, I love you, Daddy.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAnd in that moment, she not only blessed her Daddy.  Her Heavenly \nFather blessed herimmeasurably.\u0014",

    "words": "Preached by Dr. David M. Hughes\u0014\nFirst Baptist Church\u0014\nWinston-Salem, NC\u0014\nMay 23, 1999\u0014\n\u0014\n                                              THE BIG TEN - GOD'S \nRULES FOR THE GAME OF LIFE\u0014\n                                                                     \nRULE NO. 7:  BE FAITHFUL\u0014\n\n                                                                                  \nExodus 20:14\u0014\n\u0014\n\tJason is a college student who took a class on leadership.  One day \nthe class was talking about downsizing in the corporate world.  The \nprofessor asked the class if they had to downsize the Ten \nCommandments, what commandments would they eliminate. \u0014\n\u0014\nJason reports that most of the students, including himself, thought \nthe commandment not to commit adultery should be removed.  Why? \nBecause this commandment is outdated, and nobody obeys it anywayso \nwhy have it?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIs Jason and his college class right?  That's what we'll be \nexploring today as we continue our series on the Ten Commandments \nentitled, The Big TenGod's Rules for the Game of Life  Today our \nfocus shifts to what is surely the least popular and most provocative \nof the Ten Commandments.  Rule number seven says, You shall not \ncommit adultery.  Or put another way, Be faithful.  Be faithful to \nyour marriage, yourself, your God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHow could Jason's class reach the conclusion that rule number 7 \nshould be cut from the list?  Because, says Dr. Laura (Schlessinger), \nwe live in an adultery culture.  In other words, we live in a \nculture that glamorizes, promotes, and defends having sexual \nrelationships outside of marriage.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tFor decades now, Americans have been on the receiving end of a tidal \nwave of sex-saturated media that has all but normalized sex outside \nof marriage.  An article in Elle magazine tells us that an affair \ncan be sexually recharging, an escape from a worn-out relationship, \nand a way into something better.  Movies like The Horse Whisperer \nmake us cheer for infidelity despite ourselves, and make us feel \ndisappointed that the wife doesn't leave her husband and live with \nRobert Redford happily ever after.  No less than Ted Turner, the \nfounder of CNN, said just a few months ago that rule number 7 ought \nto be cut from the list.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAnd sometimes it does seem like everybody else is doing it.  Surveys \ntell us that 30-40% of all married men, and 20-25% of all married \nwomen are unfaithful to their marriages sometime during their married \nlives.  Researchers also refer to the 70/70 phenomenon which holds \nthat 70% of all men who earn more than $70,000 a year have affairs.  \nWhat better example than our President, who makes 200 grand a year, \nand who recently had to confess inappropriate contact with Monica \nLewinski?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut the biggest contributor to our culture of adultery is our poor \nunderstanding of sexuality.  As Jim Dethmer says, today when school \nteachers provide sex education for children, they don't tell them too \nmuch.  They tell them too little.  By law our teachers have to \nconfine themselves to the physical mechanics of sex.  So our kids \nwind up with a decent understanding of how sex works.  But they're \noften never told what sex means.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSometimes folks in church are squeamish about sex.  Not the Bible.  \nIt is explicit and eloquent on the subject.  Without a hint of \nembarrassment the Bible says that God created Adam and Eve, and they \nwere naked and unashamed.  God provided Adam and Eve with sexual \nhormones and desires, and when he told them to be fruitful and \nmultiply, they didn't say, Do we have to?!  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut the Bible also makes it clear that when two people become one \nflesh, something very profound happens.  Their bodies fuse, but more \nimportantly, their souls fuse, too.  That's what the Apostle Paul was \ntrying to say in 1 Corinthians 6.  Our bodies aren't just glorified \npieces of meat.  They are temples of the Holy Spirit.  And when we \nhave sex with another, we are actually intermingling spirit with \nspirit, soul with soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tJim Dethmer has a graphic illustration of this principle.  If you go \noutside in the dead of winter in sub-freezing temperatures and place \nyour tongue on a metal pole, you'll leave a piece of your tongue \nbehind if you try to pull away from the pole.  In the same way, every \ntime you have sex with somebody, you leave a piece of your soul with \nthem.   That's why Demi Moore couldn't have been more wrong in the \nmovie Indecent Proposal.  As she ponders Robert Redford's offer to \nhave sex with him for 1 million dollars, she tells her husband it \nwon't be that big a deal because all she'll be giving Redford is her \nbody, not her mind and her soul.  But what Demi and many people today \nmiss is that you can't separate the body from the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tToday people think that when two people have sex all that happens is \nthat their bodies have intimate contact for a few minutes.  The truth \nis, when two people have sex their souls have intimate contact in a \nway that lasts for all eternity.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tNow so far, I've made it sound like there's only one kind of \nadulteryphysical adulterybut that's not true.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tMany of us, for example, have flirted with emotional adultery.  \nWe've never actually consummated a relationship with someone, but we \nhave become very attached emotionally.  Jesus has emotional adultery \nin mind in Matthew 5:27-28 when he says, You know the commandment \nwhich says, Be faithful in marriage.  But I tell you that if you \nlook at another woman and want her, you are already unfaithful in \nyour thoughts.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIs it wrong for woman to take a second look at Brad Pitt, or a man \nto take notice of Julia Roberts?  No, it's only human for men and \nwomen to notice one another.  But when you begin to fixate on \nsomebody, confide deep secrets to somebody, lean heavily on somebody, \nwant somebody other than your spouse, you are into emotional \nadultery. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSpiritual adultery is a huge concern in scripture.  The book of \nHosea in the Old Testament compares Israel to Hosea's wife Gomer, who \nis an adulterous prostitute.  The Hebrew word for adultery means to \nadulterate or contaminate, and spiritually it refers to adulterating \nour relationship with God by mixing other gods into our lives.  As a \nrule, those who commit physical adultery have already committed \nspiritual and emotional adultery.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tToday, psychologists also talk about cyber-adultery.  That is to \nsay, many people are now cruising the Internet, stopping at \npornographic web sites and chat rooms and conducting affairs through \ntheir computers and telephone.  The Internet contains some 28,000 \nsites peddling almost 1 million pieces of pornographic information, \ngenerating a billion dollars of revenue a year.  Every year, more and \nmore people leave marriages for cyber-mates, people they have met on \ntheir computers. There are lots of ways to leave your spouse, and \ncyber-adultery is one of them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat are the primary causes of adultery?  Anger is certainly on the \nlist.  Years ago I heard Winston-Salem's own David Mace say in a \nconference on marriage that nothing destroys a marriage like \nunresolved anger.  Anger that festers between husband and wife can be \nlike a cancer that eats away at the relationship.  A wife is sick and \ntired of the way or husband mistreats her.  Suddenly she finds a man \nwho seems to understand her and value for who she is.  Before long, \nshe's in the arms of that other man.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tRebellion is another root cause of adultery.  Sometimes we just get \ntired of the rules and want to break free.  We begin to think that \nthe wag who said monogamy was nothing more than monotony was exactly \nright.  There's something about forbidden fruit that makes it seem \nmighty fine.  And we find ourselves wanting to re-write the rules, \nand make our own rules as we go.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThat's precisely what King David did.  He saw beautiful Bathsheba \ntaking a bath, and he wanted her.  He said, Even though I'm not \nsupposed to have her, I'm the king, and I'm going to have her.  And \nhe did.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat goes through our minds as we think about rewriting the rules?  \nJust a lot of lies and rationalizations.  \u0014\n\tNo one will ever know.\u0014\n\tThere won't be any consequences\u0014\n\tI wasn't looking for an affairit just happened.\u0014\n\tWe are soulmates.\u0014\n\tI have needs my spouse can't fulfill.\u0014\n\tI thought I was in love when I marriedbut this is the real thing.\u0014\n\tI've been under a lot of stress\u0014\n\tShe/he really understands me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMaybe you are wrestling with these rationalizations right now.  If \nyou are, just remember that these very rationalizations have ruined a \nlot of lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tActually, I'm convinced that good, old-fashioned loneliness is the \ngreatest cause of adultery.  Many a lonely soul has stared at \npornographic pictures or videos, or reached out for another body in \nthe hopes of curing loneliness.  But our deepest kind of soul \nloneliness cannot be cured by a picture, or a body.  Only one thing \ncan ultimately cure this kind of soul loneliness, and that is an \nintimate relationship with the God. John Ortberg is right when he \nsays the best way to keep our sexual energy properly harnessed and \nunder control is to develop a close and intimate relationship with \nJesus Christ.  No other substitute will do. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSomebody within the sound of my voice may be having sex outside of \nmarriage (Yes, that includes sex between two unmarried people, \ntoo/adultery and fornication is one in the same), and you're still \nwondering why not.  Here are some pitfalls of adultery you may want \nto consider.  Having sex outside of an exclusive, permanent, and \npublic relationship leads to a disconnection within yourself.  To use \nJim Dethmer's image, you are leaving little pieces of your soul all \nover the place. Soon, you feel broken and fragmented inside, split \noff from yourself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYou also feel disconnected from God.   It is very difficult, yea \nimpossible, to feel intimate with God with you are being sexually \nintimate with the wrong person.  Anybody caught up in adultery or \nenslaved in pornography will tell you that fully and freely \nworshipping God is tough because the barrier of disobedience is \nthere.  And to not be able to connect with God is a very lonely place \nto be.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tObviously, if you are being unfaithful to your marriage, you are \ndisconnected to your spouse.  I've heard wives say that even when \nthey are making love with their husbands their husbands seem far \naway.   Of course they are.  Their bodies may be temporarily \ntogether, but their souls are in some other bed.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBesides disconnection, destruction is the fruit of adultery.  \nProverbs 6:32 says He who commits adultery has no sense; he who does \nit destroys himself.  And, we might add, most everything he loves.  \nHow many children have been devastated, and families destroyed, by \nadultery?  Look at the number of children from broken homes today and \nall the problems they bring with them and ask yourself again, Is it \ntrue that adultery, the number one cause of divorce, is really no big \ndeal?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tRecently, a successful professional was in my office.  He confessed \nto me that his infidelity destroyed his first marriage.  What finally \nmade him stop and get counseling was not just that his infidelity was \nhurting his marriage or his kids. Finally, he realized his infidelity \nwas destroying his soul, slowly but surely.  Adultery may look \nharmless to Jason and his classmates, to Ted Turner and Hollywood.  \nBut ask Bill Clinton just how destructive it can be.  There never has \nbeen, and there never will be a non-devastating affair.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tDoes remaining faithful to your spouse, yourself, your God have \nbenefits?  You betcha!  It's hard work being faithful.  But fidelity \npays in spades.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tRemaining true to your spouse assures that you will remain whole \ninside.  You will not be disconnected on the inside.  You will be \nwhole.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYou will also keep your connection with the Lord strong.  This \nbenefit is impossible to overstate.  Who can place a value on a \nconscience free from guilt!  To be able to come into God's presence \nand rejoice rather than retreat is worth more than all the gold at \nFort Knox!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYou will also keep your connection with your spouse strong.  \nObviously, if you are not involved with someone else emotionally or \nphysically, your own marriage has a better chance at growing strong.  \nIf you're having trouble with your spouse, don't bail out.  Get help.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome pastoral words, and we are done.\u0014\n\tIf you have remained sexually pure your whole life, celebrate!  \nRefuse to feel like an oddball just because the world seems to think \nyou are old-fashioned and passe.  Rejoice that you are whole and \nconnected to God in the best way possible.\u0014\n\tIf you are currently engaged in sex outside of marriagepremarital \nsex, or extramarital sexconsider stopping immediately.  Make that \nphone call, write that letter, have that conversation in which you \nexplain to your mister or mistress that you now understand adultery \nis a big deal, and it's time to stop.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThere's another category of people that I will not be able to give \njustice to today, but I will mention it anyway.  If you are someone \nwho has been sexually abused, someone who has lost part of her soul \ninvoluntarily, don't despair.  Jim Dethmer puts it well when he \nreminds us that the God of the universe can perform soul surgery and \nreturn all the pieces of the soul, whether you gave them away \nvoluntarily or they were taken by force.  Get Christian counseling if \nyou need to, and hold on to the hope that God can heal you and make \nyou whole.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIf you are someone who has sinned in this area, remember that the \nsame Jesus who forgave the woman caught in adultery is ready to \nforgive you.  Sexual sin is not unforgivable sin.  If you will \nconfess your sins, God is gracious, and will cast your sins into the \ndeepest seas where they will be long-forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tA concluding thought.  You know what's beautiful?  Richard Burton \nand Elizabeth Taylor made a striking couple, but they eventually \nsplit.  Bruce Willis and Demi Moore made a striking couple, but they \nalso split.  But a beautiful pair that came to my mind is E.E. and \nRuth Phelps, long-time members of this church.  These days, Ruth \nPhelps lies dying of cancer, and E.E. visits her in the hospital \nfaithfully.  You ask Ruth how she is doing, and all she can talk \nabout is how her Sweetie E.E. will do after she is gone.  There \nthey are, after 60 plus years of faithful marriage, hand in hand, in \nsickness in health, caring for each other until their last breath.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThat, my friends, is a thing of beauty!\u0014",

    "title": "BROKEN DRILL SLOWS RESCUE EFFORT",
    "words": "Broken Drill Slows Rescue Effort for 9 Coal Miners\u0014\nBy FRANCIS X. CLINES     New York Times 7/27/02\u0014\n\u0014\nQUECREEK, Pa., July 26  Stymied through the day after a drill \nsnapped off in the rescue shaft, emergency crews labored tonight to \nresume their way down toward nine trapped coal miners, with no new \nsignal that the men were still alive in the air pocket where they \nfled on Wednesday as a flood burst in on them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They know we're coming after them,\" Joseph A. Sbaffoni, chief of the \nState Bureau of Deep Mine Safety, insisted, even though the bit of \nthe high-power drill broke off overnight about a third of the way \ndown toward the miners.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nine men are generally thought to be crouching in 50-degree water \n240 feet under the surface of the earth in a four-foot-high coal seam \nwhere they had raced to gasp for survival in a pocket of trapped air. \nTheir location was determined when they tapped on the drill pipe that \nsunk a six-inch hole to the air pocket.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe miners had unexpectedly breached an abandoned mine that was \nthought to have been a safe distance away but turned out to be filled \nwith millions of gallons of water that sent the men fleeing for their \nlives at 9:50 p.m. on Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorkers spent an excruciating 14 hours of \"fishing\" for the broken \ndrill bit 100 feet down the rescue shaft in hopes of retrieving and \nrepairing it. But until this evening, their repeated efforts were in \nvain as the 1,500-pound bit slipped from a grappler and fell back \ndown. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most hopeful estimates were that after drilling finally resumed \nat 8 o'clock tonight, rescuers would still need 7 to 10 hours to sink \nthe 30-inch shaft to the men. After that would come an intricate \nrescue maneuver involving the use of an air lock at the top of the \nshaft to retrieve the men one by one in the face of decompression \ndangers.\u0014\n\u0014\nA midday effort to use electronic sensors to hear further signs of \nlife from the air pocket was pronounced inconclusive, because of the \nnoise of nearby rescue equipment. The last clear tapping signals were \nheard on Thursday afternoon. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince 3 a.m. on Thursday, the air pocket has been steadily reinforced \nwith compressed air delivered through an emergency six-inch pipe sunk \nto hold back the surrounding waters and deliver oxygen to the miners. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn holding out hope for survival, rescuers prepared to deal with the \nthreats of hypothermia from the cold, wet environment and the bends \nfrom the lengthy period of breathing compressed air, providing that \nthe shaft reaches the men.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We've got a long way to go,\" said Gov. Mark S. Schweiker as word was \nawaited that the drilling had resumed. Because of the broken drill, a \nsecond shaft was started this morning as a parallel escape route, 70 \nfeet beyond the first. It had reached just 40 feet down by 6 p.m. \u0014\n\u0014\nWatching from her farm where emergency specialists have worked around \nthe clock since the disaster struck, Lori Arnold saluted rescuers who \nsurrendered to catnaps under trees as they refused to leave the \nrescue patch of rolling pasture directly above the miners.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When the drill broke this morning,\" Mrs. Arnold said, \"one guy had \nto go tell the miners' families, and he was crying.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're all stricken,\" she said of the eerie scene beyond her house, \npart pastoral with cows watering picturesquely, part desperate with \nrescue pumps and drills hammering away at the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We know some of the wives personally,\" she said. \"They are part of \nthis community, a place that is incredibly giving.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Arnold described sudden prayer vigils at her kitchen sink.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rescue effort is particularly challenging because the waters \nflooded the passages around the miners to a level well above them, \nand the rescue shaft has to remain air locked from above to avoid \nexploding the pocket of compressed air upward and injuring the miners \nafter the ceiling is breached.\u0014\nEmergency pumping from 12 points to surface creeks finally began \nlowering the 50 million-gallon mass of water from the two mines, \nofficials said. But the general level remained 10 feet above the \nminers at 6 p.m., with the pumps lowering the flood at the rate of a \nfoot an hour. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We want to get that water below 1,830 feet,\" Mr. Sbaffoni \nemphasized, referring to the number of feet above sea level where the \nminers waited. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat lowering of 10 more feet of water could occur by early morning, \nand it would ease the risk to the men when the shaft breaks through, \nthe official noted. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe news of the retrieved drill bit caused cheers and shouts among \nscores of relatives of the miners. They have been gathered in daily \nvigil, holding prayer circles at the Sipesville Fire Department. The \nrelatives were kept removed from a throng of reporters and camera \ncrews, whom the police threatened with arrest for any intrusions on \nthe families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis day of lost time and deep frustration was met with terse resolve \nfrom the rescue workers. \u0014\n\"We've got to keep working,\" Mr. Sbaffoni said. \"We need a little bit \nof luck.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if the men are reached and found alive, rescuers emphasized, \nthere can be no sudden rush to the surface. An escape basket has been \nready for the task, and rescuers practiced how to descend safely. \nOfficials said the basket had to be lifted very slowly because of the \nrisk of the bends, the formation of dangerous air bubbles in the \nbloodstream from fast decompression after breathing compressed air.\u0014\nA Navy specialist at the mine, Capt. Henry Schwartz, said \ndecompression would be required because the miners will have been \nliving the equivalent of 40 feet under water for two days or more. \nNine decompression chambers were ready.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough this day of slim progress, rescue specialists cited disasters \nin which miners survived, including one flood in which survivors \nclung to life with their heads in air pockets for a week.\u0014\nAs he arrived here on Thursday, Mr. Schweiker buoyed the families by \nsaying the 30-inch shaft might be sunk by as early as dawn today. But \nat 2:30 a.m., the bit's rod shaft snapped, halting the effort 140 \nfeet above the men.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It could be 8 hours from now, it could be 12 hours from now,\" the \ngovernor estimated tonight.\"\u0014\nThe estimate of where the men ran to was confirmed when the air shaft \nbroke early Thursday after engineers had mapped the most likely spot. \nNo water rushed up, and the miners quickly tapped on the drill pipe \nto signal their survival.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir air pocket is said to be in a mine corridor 48 to 52 inches \nhigh. The mined-out stretch would typically be 12 feet wide and 70 \nfeet long, although rescuers have no clear idea whether the crouching \nminers have much room for lateral movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all the setbacks in drilling the rescue shaft, the most grievous \nproblem was the lack of discernible tapping signals from below for \nmore than a day. Privately, a friend of the trapped miners watching \nthe rescue scene conceded to losing hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Schweiker paused at length in fielding a question about what the \nsilence suggested. \"Well,\" he gently responded, \"it's a problem.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Basic Documents Lack Christian Connections\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor, Times-Dispatch: As a professor who regularly assigns works by \nMadison, Jefferson, Franklin, and Paine, I find recent letters on \nAmerica's Christian essence both misinformed and dispiriting. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne correspondent quotes the Constitution's insistence that \"Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" and on \nthe basis of this clause concludes, \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is no required so-called separation of church and state \ndeclared in the Constitution.\" The definition of \"to establish\" \nrelevant here is not \"to found,\" but, in the words of The Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary, \"to place (a church or a religious body) in the \nposition of a state church.\" A church bearing Congress' seal of \napproval is precisely what the Constitution forbids. If that's not \nseparation, what is?\u0014\nDepictions of the Founders' generation as a uniformly pious lot are \nsimilarly misleading. Thomas Paine lumped together Christianity and \nGreek mythology, since both tell stories about gods who get women \npregnant. He said so in print, and got into a lot of trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers were more circumspect. Jefferson privately re-wrote the \nGospels, preserving the moral teachings of Jesus while cutting out \nreferences to his divinity, and founded a university not affiliated \nwith a church, the first such institution the world had ever known.\u0014\n\u0014\nA rather vague being referred to as \"Nature's God\" and \"divine \nProvidence\" does make cameo appearances in the Declaration of \nIndependence, but Providence shows up in the Constitution only as a \ncity in Rhode Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth documents would have a very different flavor if phrases like \n\"Jesus Christ\" appeared in them, and those who imagine that the \nUnited States was set up as a fundamentally Christian country have to \ntell us why the Founders somehow failed to mention it. One thing is \nclear. If the founding documents of our nation were accused of being \nChristian, there wouldn't be enough evidence to convict them. Thomas \nPeyser. Richmond.\u0014",

    "words": "Aug 10, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\nBelief in miracles requires trust, accepting the unknown\u0014\n\u0014\nSTACY HAWKINS ADAMS\u0014\nINSPIRATIONS \u0014\n\u0014\nEven among people who believe in God, differences of opinion are \ncommon.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the matter of miracles, for example.\u0014\n\u0014\nI asserted in a column last week that we should consider as miracles \nthe July 28 rescue of nine men from a flooded Pennsylvania mine, as \nwell as many daily occurrences we often take for granted.\u0014\n\u0014\nI intimated that rather than good fortune, miracles are blessings \ndelivered in God's way and God's timing.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany readers agreed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey shared details of situations in which a miracle saved lives. \nThey expressed gratitude for the reminder not to disregard life's \nsimple gifts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut some found the column disturbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey believe in God, they said, but question whether it's accurate to \ncredit him with performing modern-day feats.\u0014\nIf God is in the miracle-making business, one reader asked, why does \nhe do it so selectively?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy didn't he save 5-year-old Samantha Runnion of California from \nbeing kidnapped and murdered by a former neighbor?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy didn't he intervene before terrorists killed seven people, \nincluding five Americans, at Hebrew University in Jerusalem nine days \nago?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does God allow good people to die young and individuals who have \ncommitted terrible deeds to continue living?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you explain being in the wrong place at the wrong time?\u0014\n\u0014\nI'll readily admit that I don't have the answers. And I know how it \nfeels to be in the center of a storm, unable to immediately see how \nGod can produce a miracle from the circumstances, either for me or \nfor someone else.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut my personal belief - that the Creator is wise, powerful and \nbenevolent enough to decide when and how best to intervene in a \nsituation - is a matter of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the questions deserved a response, because they're the kind of \nissues I, and others who believe in miracles, wish we understood.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe fret over the violence and evil occurring around the world just \nlike others. We question why bad things happen to good people, and \nvice versa.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet many of us accept that it is beyond our human ability to \nunderstand God's motivations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We find ourselves in the 21st century in a world in which everything \nhas an explanation and everything is measurable and can be calculated \nand, we believe, everything can be understood,\" said Rabbi Merrill \nShapiro, leader of Congregation Or Atid, a Jewish synagogue in \nHenrico County.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But God is well beyond that realm,\" Shapiro said. \"To think we can \nunderstand why God takes the life of a 25-year-old, or even a \n2-year-old, or why God created conjoined-at-the-head twins is \narrogant or egotistical of us. It's also arrogant of us to think we \ncan second-guess God or understand why God does one thing and not the \nother.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, a longtime friend who has suffered for the past year with a \ncrippling and painful ailment told me after the column ran that she \nstill experiences miracles, despite her daily struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What people fail to realize is, it's the mountains that bring you \ncloser to God,\" she said. In tackling those mountains, she said, we \noften encounter miracles.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if we'll allow it, we can be used by God to help give life to the \nmiraculous.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One of the miracles God created was human beings that have free \nwill,\" Shapiro said. \"Evil comes into the world through the hands of \nhuman beings who make the wrong choices.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The rescuers of the nine miners could have chosen to stay home with \ntheir families, go out to eat at a restaurant, watch TV or go to a \nmovie, but they made good choices,\" he said. \"They said, 'This is \nwhat is important,' so they brought good to the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message? To believe in miracles is to believe in the power of an \nunseen God to orchestrate and deliver his blessings in his divine \nwisdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt requires us to blindly trust him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt requires us to accept that there are some things we may never \nunderstand while we live on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if we can believe that God performs miracles, even when we don't \nsee one on the horizon, we can believe that somehow, he'll yield \nfruit from a tragic or heartbreaking situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat fruit could be an overflowing goodness from mankind, like that \nseen after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when strangers befriended \none another and people from across the nation filled coffers with \ndonations to help survivors and grieving families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fruit could be a person's discovery of his or her ability to \npersevere through challenges and in the process, become more mature.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fruit could be an unexpected blessing from an unexpected source, \nor a person's newfound zest for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to biblical Scriptures, one cannot view situations from a \nspiritual perspective without opening one's heart to faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet even when we do so, we must accept that attempting to know God's \nways is a never-ending process.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we continue to seek him, however, we'll become better at detecting \nmiracles in the making, even amid trials.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs one reader put it, \"We just need to be aware and listen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Stacy Hawkins Adams at (804) 649-6578 Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTISTS:PARADOX PEOPLE WITH A PERSONAL FAITH",
    "words": "Baptists: Paradox people with a personal faith\u0014\n\u0014\n By James M. Dunn\u0014\n\u0014\n A handsome, stocky, youngish man tapped on my office door. (Now that \nI'm 70, everyone is\u0014\n youngish.) Turns out he had come to my nest in the steeple of Wait \nChapel, high above the\u0014\n Wake Forest University campus, to see if he and his teenage son \ncould go on up higher in the\u0014\n tower. They couldn't.\u0014\n\u0014\n But then he confessed to being a Missouri Synod Lutheran pastor and \npolitely began asking\u0014\n questions about our divinity school. I probably told him more than \nhe wanted to know. He, trying\u0014\n to wrap up the conversation and extricate himself, said: \"So, you'd \nsay that the divinity school is\u0014\n conservative.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \"No,\" I said, \"we couldn't rightly be called liberal or \nconservative. We're Baptist, and that's\u0014\n neither.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Reflecting on that answer, I remembered Brooks Hays' response to a \nquery about whether he\u0014\n was liberal or conservative. \"We are all both,\" he said. \"Take my \nold dog, Fergus, here. He's\u0014\n liberal when he chases a rabbit, but conservative when he buries a \nbone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Brooks was right. At times we are either or neither or both. That is \nvery Baptist.\u0014\n\u0014\n I am persuaded there is a Baptist way of being Christian; that there \nis something distinctly\u0014\n Baptist in the way we do theology and ethics and politics. We call \nit \"soul freedom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n It avoids the Manichean dualism that plagues Western thought. It \novershoots the\u0014\n \"it's-gotta-be-this-or-that\" mentality. It has a capacity for \nambiguity that leaves room for faith\u0014\n and promotes wholeness, not fragmentation. It does not fear \nambivalence, but humbly accepts\u0014\n that dimension of the human condition. It gives us a chance to face \na world that is no longer\u0014\n black and white, but comes at us in living color.\u0014\n\u0014\n The baptist beast has some distinctive markings in the Christian \nzoo. Neither liberal nor\u0014\n conservative, but Baptist, may be our secret weapon, our answer to \nthe heart hunger of lots of\u0014\n folks who seek immediacy, honesty, reality in religion. That's the \nquestion, isn't it?\u0014\n\u0014\n Martin Marty in a watershed article in 1983, \"Baptistification Takes \nOver,\" noted the trend in this\u0014\n country \"to zero in on the key issue that modernity poses for \nreligion: choice.\" A decade later in\u0014\n an insightful book, The American Religion, Harold Bloom hit the same \nnote and affirmed the\u0014\n competence of the individual before God as a distinctly Baptist \ntheme and a hallmark of this\u0014\n nation's religious ethos.\u0014\n\u0014\n Bloom, America's premier literary critic, stepped off his usual turf \nto describe what he takes to\u0014\n be a peculiarly American religion that insists upon \"soul competency \n[that] destroys\u0014\n fundamentalism ... sanctioning endless interpretive possibilities.\" \nSounds pretty baptist to me.\u0014\n\u0014\n In his \"baptistification\" piece Marty pled for both the churchly or \ncatholic approach and the\u0014\n sectarian or baptistic way of doing religion. Marty sees the two \nsides as opposite, but always\u0014\n complementary forces. He contends that the baptist side calls for \nchoice, individual freedom,\u0014\n decision and knowing who one is in the family of faith -- as Bill \nMoyers says, \"a grown-up's\u0014\n religion.\" On the catholic side one is born into one's church.\u0014\n\u0014\n Marty sees the two approaches coexisting because the Holy Spirit \nneeds both. Without this\u0014\n complementarity, Marty sees one's faith as incomplete. He pleads for \nboth catholic and baptist\u0014\n styles because \"both draw on the common Christian story of God's \nactivity in Jesus Christ,\u0014\n witnessed to by the power of the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures and \nin the testimony of believers.\u0014\n We need both styles to be healthy, open, developing and interactive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Baptists have always dealt in dyads: General and Particular, \nSeparate and Regular,\u0014\n independent and interdependent, truth and freedom, sola scriptura \nand sola fide. We have\u0014\n been necessarily dialogical. We were dialectical before being \ndialectical was cool. Some may\u0014\n even say diabolical, always fussing and fighting over contradictions.\u0014\n\u0014\n We need not fear contradictions. According to a recent Newsweek \narticle, \"the contradictions in\u0014\n Jesus' legacy are thick and epic. In defeat there is victory; in \nhumility, strength; in surrender,\u0014\n gain; in darkness, light. All counterintuitive ideas.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n So whether we talk about paradox, mystery, complementarity, conflict \nor contradictions, we\u0014\n have to deal with tensions between our freedoms and our beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\n We hold a faith that is PERSONAL rather than propositional, \nEXPERIENTIAL rather than\u0014\n academic, DYNAMIC rather than static, ACTIVE rather than passive, \nand LIVELY rather than\u0014\n dead-letter.\u0014\n\u0014\n According to Ansbro, the academic agenda for Martin Luther King Jr. \nwhen he went to Boston\u0014\n was to champion the personal: a personal God, a personal faith, a \npersonal theology. He saw\u0014\n the church as \"beloved community.\" Tillich turned him off. He was \nnot interested in propping up\u0014\n faith with propositions.\u0014\n\u0014\n Our baptist brand is not so much liberal or conservative as \nPERSONAL. We sing with the\u0014\n Apostle Paul \"I know whom I have belived,\" not \"I know what I have \nbelieved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Experience was a key for E.Y. Mullins, a Massachusetts pastor who \nknew and appreciated Will\u0014\n James. His 1908 book, Axioms of Religion, written for American \nBaptists, became the classic\u0014\n definition of what it means to be Baptist: a symphony of freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n In fact, Bloom, in the book mentioned above, nominates Edgar Young \nMullins as the \"Calvin or\u0014\n Luther or Wesley of Baptists ... the definer of their creedless \nfaith.\" Bloom believes that \"Mullins\u0014\n is the most neglected of major American theologians. Pragmatically, \nhe is more important than\u0014\n Jonathan Edwards, Horace Bushnell and the Niebuhrs because [he] ... \nformulated the faith of a\u0014\n major American denomination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Mullins' central contribution was the concept of the competence of \nthe individual before God, or\u0014\n EXPERIENTIAL religion. We say with the man born blind: \"Whether he \n[Jesus] is a prophet or\u0014\n not, I know not. One thing I do know, that I was blind but now I \nsee.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Dynamic and dissenting, not static, describes the biblical doctrine \nof Baptists. For Bloom,\u0014\n Mullins sets out the baptist way. For him, \"the weird metaphor of a \n'liberal' or 'inerrant' reading\u0014\n totally vaporizes.\" Every believer has the right and responsibility \nof personal interpretation. This\u0014\n dialectical tension has cursed and blessed baptists from our \nbeginnings. We have never been\u0014\n very good at accepting creeds or norms.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Choose ye this day\" could read for us, \"choose ye each day.\" There \nis a volitional and\u0014\n therefore cognitive aspect to our faith. We have to keep on deciding \nto follow Jesus. It is the\u0014\n \"awful burden of freedom\" of which Brunner spoke.\u0014\n\u0014\n Samuel Stillman was the only Massachusetts Baptist minister listed \namong the 118 members of\u0014\n a society for the abolition of slavery. Yet he owned at least one \nslave, Jephthah, his body\u0014\n servant. Stillman could preach an artillery sermon and other \npatriotic stemwinders for the\u0014\n American revolution and at the same time passionately support a \nseparation of church and\u0014\n state. To quote Emerson, \"A foolist consistency is the hobgoblin of \nlittle minds, adored by little\u0014\n statesmen and philosophers and divines.\" Being baptist means we are \nstill trying to decide.\u0014\n\u0014\n We respond to Bonhoeffer's insistence that no one can possess the \nWord of God for a single\u0014\n instant other than in the doing of it. Ours is a practiced faith, \nACTIVE, not merely an academic\u0014\n exercise. Missionary, maybe too much. Moral, maybe moralistic. \nEvangelistic, even\u0014\n proselytizing. Ethical, often pontifical in our certainty, but \nactive. Our hyperactive faith may look\u0014\n liberal or conservative depending on what you're compared to. In \nJohn 7:17, Jesus challenged\u0014\n searchers: \"If any ... will do his will, he shall know the doctrine \nwhether it be of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The \"lively experiment\" entered into by Roger Williams when he was \nbanished from\u0014\n Massachusetts had much in common with baptistness. To paraphrase \nBuckminster Fuller,\u0014\n Baptist is a verb. We \"baptist.\" We are more a process, a journey, a \nmovement than an\u0014\n organized religion or an institution.\u0014\n\u0014\n We are always juggling, always struggling. Ed Gaustad, speaking of \nRoger Williams' \"lively\u0014\n experiment,\" suggests that Williams was \"out to do nothing less than \nalter the institutional\u0014\n structure of the Western world.\" LIVELY! Sounds pretty liberal, but \nsome consider following any\u0014\n 17th century white European male decadently conservative. But, it's \nquick and powerful and\u0014\n sharper than a two-edged sword -- this faithful freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n So, maybe a baptist alternative to the TULIP of constipated \nCalvinists of the five-principle sort\u0014\n would be PEDAL, for a faith that is personal, experiential, \ndissenting, active and lively.\u0014\n\u0014\n But living such a fluid faith, not neatly creedal, seldom \npolitically correct, makes extreme\u0014\n demands. We need an extra dose of modesty and humility that is born \nof a biblical awareness\u0014\n of our sin and fallibility and frailty. We must pray for the wisdom \nthat only God can give. We will\u0014\n surely be tempted and tried and oft made to wonder why it should be \nthus all the day long.\u0014\n\u0014\n So what if being Baptist calls us to fight pigeonholing and to \nresist libel by label?\u0014\n\u0014\n What does it mean to this generation of Baptists that some of us \nrefuse to be called\u0014\n \"evangelical\" unless you let us define the word?\u0014\n\u0014\n What does it do for pluralism if we claim that anyone's religious \nliberty denied means that\u0014\n everyone's religious liberty is in danger?\u0014\n\u0014\n What does it matter that one reason Baptists have always stood firm \nfor separation of church\u0014\n and state is that we have room for liberals and conservatives of all \nsorts and are convinced that\u0014\n neither church nor state have any business messing with our personal \nrelationships to God?\u0014\n\u0014\n I may admire, learn from and stand in awe of conservatives cut from \ntheological or political\u0014\n templates, but I cannot be one. That does not mean I'm content to be \nlabeled liberal. I insist on\u0014\n being free to be either, neither or both. Just tag me a Baptist with \na capital \"B.\".\u0014\n\u0014\n Perhaps our best contribution is to be who we have been, to dissent, \nto be ourselves, to greet\u0014\n tension and with energy turn it creative, to suffer because the more \nwe know the joy of\u0014\n freedom, the more we hurt.\u0014\n\u0014\n (James M.

    "words": "Basic Documents Lack Christian Connections\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a professor who regularly assigns works by Madison, Jefferson, \nFranklin, and Paine, I find recent letters on America's Christian \nessence both misinformed and dispiriting.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne correspondent quotes the Constitution's insistence that \"Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" and on \nthe basis of this clause concludes:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is no required so-called separation of church and state \ndeclared in the Constitution.\" The definition of \"to establish\" \nrelevant here is not \"to found,\" but, in the words of The Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary , \"to place (a church or a religious body) in the \nposition of a state church.\" A church bearing Congress' seal of \napproval is precisely what the Constitution forbids. If that's not \nseparation, what is?\u0014\n\u0014\nDepictions of the Founders' generation as a uniformly pious lot are \nsimilarly misleading. Thomas Paine lumped together Christianity and \nGreek mythology, since both tell stories about gods who get women \npregnant. He said so in print, and got into a lot of trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers were more circumspect. Jefferson privately re-wrote the \nGospels, preserving the moral teachings of Jesus while cutting out \nreferences to his divinity, and founded a university not affiliated \nwith a church, the first such institution the world had ever known.\u0014\n\u0014\nA rather vague being referred to as \"Nature's God\" and \"divine \nProvidence\" does make cameo appearances in the Declaration of \nIndependence, but Providence shows up in the Constitution only as a \ncity in Rhode Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth documents would have a very different flavor if phrases like \n\"Jesus Christ\" appeared in them, and those who imagine that the \nUnited States was set up as a fundamentally Christian country have to \ntell us why the Founders somehow failed to mention it.

That was the \nmistake we made over that old\u0014\n                      Pearl Harbor thing. We rashly jumped to the \nconclusion that one particular Asia-based\u0014\n                      group was responsible, thus touching off World \nWar II, instead of setting up tolerance\u0014\n                      programs. The NEA is willing to concede that \n\"someone is at fault\" for September 11,\u0014\n                      but who that someone might be is apparently \nsupposed to remain a mystery in the\u0014\n                      schools.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The NEA tried to wriggle off the hook  by \narguing that the no-group-is-responsible\u0014\n                      text comes from a link to an outside site.  \nYes, but the link is clearly presented as\u0014\n                      part of NEA's recommended treatment of 9/11 \nunder the heading \"Tips for parents and\u0014\n                      schools.\" The entire, sprawling \"Remember \nSeptember 11\" site is a peculiar mess.\u0014\n                      Maybe half the material is about  feelings and \nhow schools must help validate them in a \u0014\n                      nonjudgmental way. Students in grades three to \nfive are urged to respond to 9/11 by \u0014\n                      identifying personal health needs in their \ndaily lives, then by blowing bubbles as a way to \u0014\n                      shed bad feelings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is endless emphasis on \"healing tools\" \nand \"the circle of feelings\" but almost\u0014\n                      nothing on the facts and meaning of September \n11. Everything is carried into the\u0014\n                      abstract. The attacks are lumped with random \nacts of violence and natural disasters.\u0014\n                      Even a section labeled \"Communicating the \nFacts\" is fact free, instructing teachers\u0014\n                      vaguely to identify student perceptions and to \n\"determine what further information is\u0014\n                      needed to form rational opinions\" about \nSeptember 11. Spend a half-hour with this site,\u0014\n                      and you will be hard pressed to find any 9/11 \nfacts at all.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Kamping with Karl. Many of the suggested 9/11 \nclass projects seem like rainy-day\u0014\n                      activities at a Marxist summer camp. In one, \nchildren are assigned to different power\u0014\n                      groups, then asked to treat one another in \nterms of how much power each student\u0014\n                      has. It's a simple-minded, Marxist class \nanalysis posing as a response to 9/11. In\u0014\n                      another activity, all children in a class are \ncharged the same fee for lunch, but a few\u0014\n                      get a \"sumptuous\" meal, many get beans and \nrice, and most get only rice and water.\u0014\n                      Again children are asked to express their \nfeelings about all this. (Possible answer:\u0014\n                      Loved paying for a whole meal and getting rice \nand water instead! Marx was right!\u0014\n                      Can't wait to do it again!)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The folly of the NEA is staggering, but the \ngroup insists that it offers plenty of\u0014\n                      \"patriotic\" material. Well, yes, but almost \nnone of this material is included in the NEA\u0014\n                      lesson plans (or wasn't until late last week \nwhen it altered the site). Before that, I\u0014\n                      found one reference to \"the documents\" \n(apparently the Constitution and the\u0014\n                      Declaration of Independence, among other texts) \nin a lesson plan. Here's the\u0014\n                      recommendation: Parcel out various patriotic \ndocuments to sections of the class, then\u0014\n                      after a few minutes, ask students in each group \nhow they felt about the document\u0014\n                      they just read.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is a museum-quality example of NEA \nculture: Don't actually teach anything,\u0014\n                      certainly nothing about American traditions and \nvalues. Instead, turn everything into a\u0014\n                      class activity based on the gathering of \noff-the-cuff, uninformed impressions, all of\u0014\n                      which are valid because all opinions and \nattitudes are equal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This mind-set is the dominant one in the \nschools of education and on various education\u0014\n                      Web sites now offering advice about September \n11. \"It's rotten advice, relativistic,\u0014\n                      nonjudgmental (except about the United States), \npacifist, and anything but patriotic,\"\u0014\n                      writes Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the \nThomas B. Fordham Foundation.

Precisely what you do depends on your \nstrength, your confidence and your assessment of the assailant's \nintentions. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are faced with an armed mugger who wants your cash, it may be \nsafer to hand it over rather than to risk getting seriously injured \nin a fight. \u0014\n\u0014\nFaced with a potential killer and no way to escape, on the other \nhand, you may have nothing to lose by fighting. The techniques listed \nhere need some practice but not extensive training. All are dangerous \n-- some are lethal. Never use them in earnest except in an emergency, \nand never use more than sufficient and reasonable force. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you fight, never give a warning. Strike swiftly and as hard as you \ncan. Be ready to repeat the blow or follow up with a different one. \nScream or shout as you fight. Keep on until you can escape or your \nassailant collapses. \u0014\n\u0014\nTechniques to Fight Off an Attacker \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Stomach Jab\u0014\nYou can use this technique if an assailant attacks you from behind, \nwith his arms around your neck. Twist your body slightly, clench your \nfist, and raise your arm. Then, jab backward with your elbow into the \nattacker's stomach as hard as you can, aiming to wind him. This \nshould force him to relax his grip enough for you to break free. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scrape and Stamp\u0014\nIf the stomach jab fails to break his grip, lift a foot and scrape \nthe edge of your shoe down the front bony part of his shin. \nHigh-heeled shoes are particularly effective. Stamp hard on the \nattacker's foot. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Finger Twist\u0014\nIf he grabs your throat, grasp his little fingers and wrench them up \nand away from your neck. This will cause extreme pain and will \nprobably break his fingers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Throat Jab\u0014\nHold the fingers of one hand rigidly straight and jab them into his \nthroat, using either the ends of your fingers or the edge of your \nhand. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Knee in the Groin\u0014\nMove in close and bring your knee up sharply into his groin. This \nwill not work, though, if he is wearing a coat or if he twists away \nfrom you. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Eye Jab\u0014\nDrop anything you are carrying to free your hands. Make a V with two \nfingers and poke them hard into the attacker's eyes.\u0014",

If that's not \nseparation, what is?\u0014\n\u0014\nDepictions of the Founders' generation as a uniformly pious lot are \nsimilarly misleading. Thomas Paine lumped together Christianity and \nGreek mythology, since both tell stories about gods who get women \npregnant.

    "title": "BEYOND 1Q: 7 QUOTIENTS FOR LEADERS",
    "words": "Beyond IQ: 7 Quotients for Leaders\u0014\n   by Alan Nelson, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   As a spiritual leader, you're in the people business. Your job\u0014\n   is to build big people who in turn build strong organizations.\u0014\n   Strong means more than size; it means high quality, health,\u0014\n   and vitality. Spiritual leaders, far more than their non-\u0014\n   spiritual counterparts, elevate the development of people over\u0014\n   the building of organizations, knowing that when they take\u0014\n   care of the part, the whole will be healthy. Failing to\u0014\n   develop the part, the whole stands less of a chance of being\u0014\n   productive over the long haul. Keeping that in the forefront\u0014\n   of your thinking and planning becomes a challenge; the natural\u0014\n   leader part of you will want to elevate the organization over\u0014\n   the individual.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Matching people to roles according to their gifts is\u0014\n   essential. The purpose of an organization is to maximize the\u0014\n   strengths of people and minimize their weaknesses. By\u0014\n   harnessing the abilities and talents of people, you'll create\u0014\n   a synergistic effect. An effective leader is a matchmaker who\u0014\n   marries people and roles. There are no wrong people, just\u0014\n   wrong positions. The leader's job is to help people succeed.\u0014\n   The best chance of this is by placing them in positions that\u0014\n   unleash their talents. Don't worry about working on a\u0014\n   weakness, unless it sabotages a strength.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Mere aptitude tests can fall short in unveiling strengths.\u0014\n   Here is a brief list of organizational quotients to assess and\u0014\n   observe:\u0014\n\u0014\n   IQ (Intelligence Quotient): Spiritual leaders sometimes\u0014\n   underestimate the role of IQ. This is pretty much a God-given\u0014\n   factor. It does not reflect education, but rather a capacity\u0014\n   to process information. Put low-IQ people in demanding\u0014\n   situations and you'll overwhelm them, stressing them out and\u0014\n   frustrating others. Place people with higher IQs in simple\u0014\n   roles and you'll bore them to death.\u0014\n\u0014\n   AQ (Attitude Quotient): Attitude is contagious, so make sure\u0014\n   you place high-AQ people in places where they can infect\u0014\n   others with their positive energy. Low-AQ people are negative,\u0014\n   pessimistic, and melancholy in nature, so try to keep them\u0014\n   away from where their attitudes will adversely affect other\u0014\n   people and decision making.\u0014\n\u0014\n   RQ (Resource Quotient): First analyze the type of resources a\u0014\n   person has: time, talent, or treasure. Especially in volunteer\u0014\n   organizations, time and treasure factors become as big as\u0014\n   talent issues. People who have talents but limited time must\u0014\n   be used strategically. People with treasures but little time\u0014\n   can provide needed capital to fund projects.\u0014\n\u0014\n   PQ (People Quotient): High-PQ people are good relationally.\u0014\n   They shine among others. Place these people in front-end\u0014\n   customer service roles. They'll make your organization appear\u0014\n   better than it is. Low-PQ people are good behind the scenes,\u0014\n   where they won't bore, offend, or alienate others. Use their\u0014\n   other gifts, but keep them out of public or team-leading\u0014\n   venues.\u0014\n\u0014\n   MQ (Maturity Quotient): Emotional and spiritual maturity\u0014\n   provide great stability within people. Decision makers,\u0014\n   mentors, and influencers need a certain level of consistency,\u0014\n   insight, and discernment. Talented people lacking maturity are\u0014\n   attractive, but they can be organizational kindling, starting\u0014\n   unnecessary fires and making messes.\u0014\n\u0014\n   EQ (Energy Quotient): There are turtles and there are rabbits.\u0014\n   You can't do a lot about energy levels. Don't overwhelm\u0014\n   turtles or you'll lose them. Conversely, let the rabbits run,\u0014\n   but put measures in place to ensure accuracy and completeness.\u0014\n   Provide them with plenty of things to do and don't team them\u0014\n   up with turtles and therefore frustrate them. High EQs can\u0014\n   handle a lot on their plates and thrive on busyness.\u0014\n\u0014\n   CQ (Commitment Quotient): CQ is the key to unlock the other\u0014\n   quotients. The greatest frustration for any leader is to have\u0014\n   people with high quotients who lack motivation and commitment.\u0014\n   Low-CQ people will hold back, while high-CQ people will go the\u0014\n   extra mile. One of the primary tasks of spiritual leaders is\u0014\n   to raise the level of commitment among followers and potential\u0014\n   followers.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Once you've assessed a person's quotients, matching the person\u0014\n   to the role becomes the final task. The better you are at\u0014\n   matching strengths with organizational needs, the more\u0014\n   effective you will be. If people flounder in the roles you've\u0014\n   assigned them, assume first that you've failed.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The most effective leaders:\u0014\n\u0014\n      1. Know the strengths of their people\u0014\n      2. Match these strengths with organizational roles\u0014\n      3. Don't worry about weaknesses (unless they deplete\u0014\n         strengths).\u0014\n\u0014\n   Alan Nelson is pastor of Scottsdale (AZ) Family Church and\u0014\n   author of Spirituality & Leadership (NavPress, 2002).\u0014",

But here is the crucial point: Baptists \nmuscular affirmations of their own truth claims never kept them from \npleading for freedom for others. \u0014\n\u0014\nEmerging from seventeenth century English Puritanism with what they \nthought to be the absolute truth of God, Baptists in America wanted \nonly to be free to place their beliefs alongside the beliefs of \nothersChristian and non-Christianwho could freely and passionately \nargue their case in the same free marketplace of ideas. Thats the \nBaptist Way!\u0014",

    "title": "BISHOP KNEW BOSTON PRIEST PRAISED MAN-BOY SEX",
    "words": "October 29, 2002\u0014\nBishop Knew Boston Priest Had Praised Man-Boy Sex\u0014\nBy PAM BELLUCK\u0014\n\u0014\nBOSTON, Oct. 28  When he was a top official in the Roman Catholic \nArchdiocese of Boston, Bishop Thomas V. Daily, who now heads the \nDiocese of Brooklyn, promoted a priest to lead a suburban parish in \n1983 even though he had received numerous complaints that the priest \nwas advocating sex between men and boys, according to a deposition \nreleased today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe priest, the Rev. Paul R. Shanley, has since become a central \nfigure in Boston's clergy sexual-abuse scandal, and is accused of \nmolesting at least 25 people, six of whom say they were abused as \nyoung children at that suburban parish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the deposition, taken in August in lawsuits filed by three of \nFather Shanley's accusers, Bishop Daily became the most senior church \nofficial to admit knowledge of complaints against Father Shanley \nyears before he was placed in a parish.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop also acknowledged that he did little in response to a \nstring of complaints that Father Shanley was giving speeches outside \nof Boston that endorsed sex between men and boys and was attending \nthe formative meetings of the North American Man-Boy Love Association.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Bishop Daily, who was the Boston Archdiocese's second \nhighest-ranking official from 1975 to 1984, was asked in the \ndeposition about accusations he received in 1977 that Father Shanley \nhad said in a speech that \"the adult is not the seducer; the kid is \nthe seducer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily responded that he could not imagine priests saying such \nthings unless they were \"drunk or something like that,\" and added, \n\"They would have to be out of their mind to say something like this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRoderick MacLeish Jr., the plaintiffs' lawyer, asked, \"Even if they \nwere drunk or out of their minds, you would want to investigate the \nmatter further, would you not?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, no question,\" Bishop Daily said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Because you would not want someone like this to be in a parish \nministry, is that correct?\" Mr. MacLeish asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not in a priestly ministry to anybody,\" Bishop Daily replied.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet in the deposition, Bishop Daily acknowledged that there was no \nindication that the archdiocese investigated those or subsequent \nsimilar accusations, discussed them with Father Shanley or did \nanything to reprimand him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily also acknowledged that as early as 1974, he knew that \nFather Shanley was a \"troubled priest\" in need of help. Yet he said \nthere was no evidence that Father Shanley was sent to a psychiatrist \nor otherwise given professional help, only that he was asked to meet \nwith Cardinal Humberto Medeiros, then the Archbishop of Boston.\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Shanley, 71, was indicted in June on 10 counts of child rape \nand 6 counts of indecent assault and battery, accused of repeatedly \nmolesting six boys while at St. Jean's parish in Newton, Mass., from \n1979 to 1989. He has pleaded not guilty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a separate case today, The Boston Herald reported that Bishop \nDaily intervened in 1977 after police officers in Nahant, Mass., \ncaught a priest, The Rev. Edward T. Kelley, engaged in sexual \nactivity with a teenage boy in a car.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a deposition, one officer, Gerard D. Perry, said the police called \nthe archdiocese, and \"Bishop Daily, he came down.\" Officer Perry \ncontinued: \"A conversation occurred. The chief and the bishop agreed \nthe bishop would handle this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficer Perry testified that Bishop Daily said Father Kelley would be \nsent for treatment, but there was no indication that happened. In \ncivil suits, Father Kelley has been accused of molesting several boys \nfrom the 1960's to the 1980's.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily's spokesman, Frank DeRosa, said the bishop was referring \nall questions about legal proceedings against him to lawyers \nrepresenting the Archdiocese of Boston, who declined to comment \ntoday. Timothy O'Neill, a lawyer for Bishop Daily, also declined to \ncomment.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he has been accused of negligence by several people who say \nthey were abused by priests, Bishop Daily has said little publicly \nabout the sexual-abuse scandal. In March, he apologized to the \nvictims of another priest in the scandal, John J. Geoghan, saying in \na statement that \"in hindsight I profoundly regret certain decisions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1970's, Father Shanley was a street minister working with \n\"alienated youth,\" but church documents indicate that in 1979, after \nthe complaints about his involvement with the man-boy love \nassociation and other complaints that he was promoting homosexuality, \nCardinal Medeiros put him in St. Jean's parish.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo restrictions about contact with children were placed on Father \nShanley, Bishop Daily acknowledged, and parishioners were not \ninformed of his background. The documents suggest that archdiocesan \nofficials saw the assignment as a way to keep Father Shanley out of \nthe limelight and discourage him from making such scandalous \nstatements.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily testified that he did not advise the cardinal or voice \nany objections to placing Father Shanley in the parish. But in 1983, \nafter Cardinal Medeiros's death but before Cardinal Bernard H. Law \nbecame archbishop, Bishop Daily made the decision on his own to \npromote Father Shanley to acting pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Didn't you have some concerns about Paul Shanley potentially coming \ninto contact with young people?\" Mr. MacLeish asked, reciting the \nlist of complaining letters Bishop Daily had received.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would say I had some concerns,\" Bishop Daily said, but added that \nhe was not aware of any complaints that Father Shanley had committed \nany of the acts he had publicly espoused. Bishop Daily said he had \nnot seen a 1966 complaint filed by a priest who accused Father \nShanley of molesting several boys in a cabin in the woods, but he \nsaid it was possible the complaint was in archdiocesan files at the \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Do you still believe it was appropriate for you to appoint Paul \nShanley as acting pastor of a family parish in Newton in 1983?\" Mr. \nMacLeish asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would have to agree that it would be extraordinary,\" Bishop Daily \nreplied. \"The only thing, the only saving feature of it is that we \nare talking about ideas and opinions in his promotion verbally, that \nthe only saving feature is that to my knowledge at the time, he \nwasn't involved in activities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily continued: \"But having even said that, if in fact he was \npromoting ideas and God knows what at St. Jean's parish, that would \nbe terrible. And there was no evidence he was at St. Jean's parish \ndoing that; he was doing that in other parts of the country. But \nhaving said that, I would have very profound regrets.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. MacLeish asked, \"You have regrets you made the appointment?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Daily replied, \"I think I would have done much better if I \nhadn't made the appointment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1984, shortly after Bishop Daily left to head the Diocese of Palm \nBeach, Fla., Cardinal Law appointed Father Shanley permanent pastor \nof St. Jean's. Bishop Daily said that he did not recall telling \nCardinal Law anything about Father Shanley's background but that the \ncardinal would probably have been aware of any complaints received \nafter his tenure began.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was clear from Bishop Daily's deposition that Father Shanley had a \nreputation as a difficult priest from the early 1970's. Bishop Daily \ntestified he could not recall another priest he had had to deal with \nmore often. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet the deposition suggests that the archdiocese did little to rein \nFather Shanley in. Mr. MacLeish asked about the archdiocese's options \nfor dealing with a priest who persisted in making statements that \nwere contrary to church teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I could get a little crude and say send him to the back room, but, I \nmean, he would certainly be talked to and talked to severely, I would \nthink,\" Bishop Daily said. But despite mentioning a few meetings \nbetween archdiocesan officials and Father Shanley, the deposition \nyielded no indication that the priest was dealt with severely at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "title": "BEHIND THE KILLER SMILES",
    "words": "Time, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2002\u0014\nBehind the Killer Smiles\u0014\nBroke and homeless, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Malvo traveled \ntogether and are accused of killing together too. A story of two \nlives gone bad \u0014\nBy AMANDA RIPLEY\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEach night the man and the boy sat hunched over the  same table, \nplaying chess in Stuart's Coffee House in the seaside town of \nBellingham, Wash. Sometimes they would play until midnight. The man, \nJohn Allen Muhammad, 41, did what little talking had to be done. The \nboy, 17-year-old Lee Malvo, listened. Whenever cafe employees \nintruded with small talk, he would glance to Muhammad, as if for \npermission, before answering. They drank only plain coffee, as the \ncollege students and patrons around them indulged in smoothies and \ntarts and poetry readings. And each game ended the same way: with \nMuhammad winning. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEverywhere they went last summer, people assumed the pair were father \nand son. It was a myth that Muhammad would actively perpetuate over \nthe next several months as the two made their way across the country. \nHe would also tell people he was a music producer or a fitness-club \nowner. In reality, Muhammad had had trouble finding work of late. And \nhe had lost custody of four of his children in a series of noxious \nlegal battles.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut together with his imagination, his Army-style duffel bag and his \nwell- mannered \"son,\" Muhammad had apparently cobbled together a \nworld for himself--one that, for a time at least, obeyed his will. \"I \nalways thought of them in an endearing way,\" Peter David, one of the \ncoffee-shop workers would later say. \"How often do you see a teenage \nson with his father? There was such respect.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was deep within that concocted universe that Muhammad and Malvo \nslept in the early hours of Oct. 24, tucked into their blue Chevrolet \nCaprice with the sniper perch built into the trunk. They must have \nslept soundly, since they didn't hear federal agents and police \ncreeping up on all sides, armed with submachine guns. Appropriately, \nthey were seized in the same benign setting in which they had \nallegedly stalked their victims--a nondescript parking lot off a \nhighway outside Washington. It is hard to imagine what castles of \ndelusion came crashing down when the tactical team smashed in the \nwindows of the Caprice and dragged the two out into the nighttime \nchill. The air was filled with screams, but witnesses could not \ndiscern if they emanated from the suspects or their captors. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin 48 hours, the man and the boy would stand accused of one of \nthe most terrifying murder rampages in the country's history, one \nthat had led the White House to contemplate opening up military bases \nso children could go trick-or- treating in safety and that had \ninduced otherwise rational residents to scurry in a zigzag formation \nacross bland suburban parking lots. In three weeks, the case elicited \n138,000 tip-line calls, seven times the number the Unabomber case \nyielded over 18 years. The 14 shots took 10 lives, though the tally \nmay still not be complete. The fbi is investigating whether unsolved \nmurders and petty thefts in other locales, from the West Coast to the \nSouth and up the Eastern Seaboard, may also be linked to the duo. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf john allen muhammad is convicted of these crimes, it will be a \ngrim epilogue to a life spent groping for a narrative. First in the \nmilitary and then in two marriages, Muhammad, a man who could be by \nturns charming and stern, seemed to find contentment just out of \nreach. And each time he faced a loss, he would fight \nback--frantically, mercilessly--for control. Two ex-wives have \naccused him of taking their children over the years. A court granted \none of his ex-wives a permanent restraining order after he allegedly \nthreatened to kill her. Acquaintances say he manipulated those around \nhim--none more so, it may turn out, than young Malvo. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is unusual for serial killers to find partners. \"In all the \nnotorious serial or spree killings in the U.S., 20% or less are \nduos,\" says N.G. Berrill, a forensic psychiatrist who teaches at John \nJay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"It's hard for them to \nfind someone who shares the vision.\" But as a pair, the killers may \nhave operated like one mind. \"When we do see duos,\" Berrill says, the \nsecond person is \"emotionally dominated by the person whose vision \nthey're acting out.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad--then named John Allen Williams--tried on his first identity \nin his hometown of Scotlandville, a Mississippi River community in \nBaton Rouge, La. In high school he was a top football player, says \nJames Johnson, an alumnus of the school who worked with the booster \nclub. \"I remember him as a good team player.\" After graduating in \n1978, Williams enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard, working \nas a carpenter and welder in a unit that repaired buildings. Three \nyears later, he married his high school sweetheart, Carol Kaglear, \nand they had a son, Lindbergh, whom he liked to show off to co- \nworkers. \"He had a million-dollar smile and was very outgoing,\" says \nRafael Miranda, Muhammad's commander at the time. \"I thought he was \ngoing to get promoted and maybe become a platoon sergeant.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nQuickly, though, the well-ordered life showed signs of strain. In \n1982 he was fined $100 for failing to show up for duty and was \ndemoted one rank. In 1983 he was fined again, this time for hitting a \nnoncommissioned officer. \"I saw flashes of anger,\" Miranda remembers. \n\"Something was going on in his personal life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1985 Muhammad made what would be one of many radical breaks from \nhis life. He separated from Carol Williams, converted to Islam, left \nthe National Guard and joined the Army. The job change even cut him \nloose from his hometown, sending him to Fort Lewis, Wash. Three years \nlater, Muhammad had completely reinvented himself. He married Mildred \nGreen, who had followed him from Louisiana. Both became members of \nthe Nation of Islam and attended a Seattle mosque. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1990 Muhammad was sent abroad, first to Germany and then to the \nMiddle East to support the Persian Gulf War. As part of a \ncombat-engineer unit, it was Muhammad's job to help destroy bunkers \nat a military site later found to have stored chemical weapons. \nAlthough there is no conclusive evidence that the soldiers suffered \nill health effects, the Pentagon did acknowledge in 1996 that \nsoldiers from some units, including Muhammad's, may have been exposed \nto low levels of chemical agents. In 1992 he was sent back to the \nStates. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years Muhammad would be awarded a chestful of decorations \nfor his military service. But, says an Army official after reviewing \nMuhammad's personnel file, \"all but one of them are basically awarded \nfor just showing up.\" The exception is the Army Achievement Medal. \nArmy officials have so far not been able to detail what he did to \nmerit that decoration.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBut one of Muhammad's greatest talents was rewarded in the military: \nhis aim. He advanced through three levels of Army marksmanship with \nthe standard M- 16 rifle, reaching the \"expert\" level. \"You have to \nbe pretty good,\" recalls Tim O'Brien, a Vietnam veteran, prizewinning \nwriter and author of the novel July, July. \"I didn't get one. There's \na lot of tension, and there's pressure, and you're shaking. You have \na drill sergeant yelling in your ear, 'Shoot straight!'\" The \nBushmaster .223 rifle, which was found in Muhammad's trunk and has \nbeen linked by police to 11 of the 13 victims, is a civilian version \nof the M-16. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps out of frustration with his middling career, Muhammad left \nthe army in 1994. Without the anchor of the service, his pursuits \ndrifted. He and Felix Strozier, a martial arts teacher, opened a \nkarate school. Muhammad promised to draw legions of Muslims to the \nschool, Strozier says. But the crowds never arrived. In what would \ncome to be something of a pattern, Muhammad also embellished his \nprofile, bragging that he had been a special-forces member in the \nmilitary, Strozier says. And he took an inappropriate interest in a \nyoung female student, showing up unannounced at her doorstep multiple \ntimes, Strozier says. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad's aggressive behavior with women turned menacing when \nchildren became involved, court documents show. While many serial \nkillers are plagued by dysfunctional sexual urges, Muhammad seemed to \nbe shadowed by a need to control the children in his life. In 1995  \nMuhammad did not return his son to his first wife after a scheduled \nvisit, Carol Williams and her relatives have told reporters. She \nengaged in a legal battle to retrieve him from Washington State. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1999 Muhammad's second family also began to fissure. Mildred filed \nfor divorce, and in March 2000 she was granted a restraining order \nagainst her husband. Not only did she complain that Muhammad had \nphysically intimidated her, but she also said he claimed to have \ntapped her phones and said he was collecting information with which \nto ruin her. \"I have had my phone number changed three times in five \ndays,\" she wrote on a court form. \"I am afraid of John. He is \nbehaving very, very irrational.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTen days later, Muhammad picked up their three children and vanished, \naccording to court documents filed by Mildred. In Bellingham, Wash., \n120 miles away, Muhammad jump-started yet another life. He reportedly \nenrolled the kids, two of them age 8, one age 10, in school using \nfalse names. In June he went to Antigua and successfully applied for \na passport, using a birth certificate that may have been falsified, \naccording to a spokesman for the Antigua Prime Minister's office. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout a year later, he changed his last name from Williams to \nMuhammad, citing religious reasons. Shortly thereafter, he returned \nto Antigua for a brief period, reportedly with the children. It was \nthere that Muhammad may have first encountered Malvo. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of that summer, though, Washington police somehow \nretrieved the children, and Mildred gained custody. She had not heard \nfrom them for more than a year, according to court filings. A Pierce \nCounty, Wash., court cut off all Muhammad's visitation rights. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe loss decimated Muhammad, says J. Mills, his lawyer from the \ncustody dispute. Through what Mills terms \"very sophisticated legal \nmaneuvering,\" Mildred allegedly won custody without Muhammad's \nknowledge. \"The system could do nothing to help John. He banged his \nhead against the wall for three months with no success,\" says Mills. \nEventually, after two custody hearings had to be canceled because \nMildred could not be located, Mills says, Muhammad gave up. \"That \nhappens a lot. If the frustration level is high enough, some turn to \nviolence.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this crucial moment, just when Muhammad had lost his family, Malvo \nreappeared. Lee Malvo was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on Feb. 18, \n1985, according to Jamaican documents. His father, Leslie Samuel \nMalvo, and half- brother, Rohan Malvo, who still live there, have \nappeared before the media, baffled and teary, to confirm that the boy \ndid live there. But he left when he was 13. Rohan told reporters that \nhis brother wasn't a bad or violent person. But he conceded to Time \nthat he hadn't seen his half-sibling in years: \"It's been such a long \ntime.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Malvo left Jamaica, he and his mother may have gone to Antigua, \nthough their exact route remains unclear. By August 2001, they were \nboth living illegally in Fort Myers, Fla. After a short time, though, \nMalvo left his mother to live with Muhammad in Washington State. \nStarting in October 2001, Malvo and Muhammad slept on adjacent bunks \nat the Light House Mission, a shelter for the homeless in Bellingham. \nAnd Malvo briefly enrolled in school. Stacey Gugich, 18, a student at \nWhatcom Community College, was a classmate at Bellingham High School. \nShe remembers a \"really friendly guy\" who was generous with his \ncompliments. She also recalls that when the class worked on a essay \nabout the Vietnam War, Malvo \"seemed to know all the technical terms \nand strategies. He seemed to know what he was talking about when it \ncame to warfare. He said his dad was in the Gulf War.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in December Malvo's mother took a bus from Florida to Bellingham \nto find her son, says a Bellingham police spokesman, Detective Lieut. \nDac Jamison. She asked the police for help. Simultaneously, the high \nschool asked the police about Malvo's missing records, and the \ndepartment referred the case to the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. Muhammad and Malvo were briefly detained as illegal \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa, \nthen released to await a hearing. Malvo, however, continued to be \nseen at Muhammad's side around Bellingham. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLight House Mission resident manager Jerry Page says he became close \nto Muhammad around this period. \"We used to sit and talk for hours \nabout the Bible and the Muslim religion,\" says Page. \"He said that he \nbelieved in the Prophet Muhammad and that everything we do on this \nearth has a cause and effect and also has an effect on other people.\" \nWhen he lost custody of his children, he put on a stoic face, Page \nsays. \"He said it wasn't meant for him to have them right now, and \nwhen the time came, the Lord would deliver them to him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the fall of 2001, now bereft of both a job and his children, \nMuhammad's behavior had become increasingly bizarre. In October \nMuhammad and Malvo began frequenting Stuart's Coffee House. Muhammad \ntook an intense interest in a redheaded street guitarist named Hannah \nParks, 20, and her son Jazz, 4. For three weeks he badgered Parks for \nher phone number and address, telling her he was a record producer \nand inviting her to come to New York with him. \"He knew a lot about \nmusic. He offered to buy me a drink and showed me a fat wallet of \nmoney,\" Parks recalls. \"I had a bad feeling about him. He took an \ninterest in my son, and that freaked me out the most.\" He asked Jazz, \nwho is half black, about his ethnicity. Parks told him not to \nquestion the boy again, and the relationship chilled. Says Parks: \"He \nwould sit there and watch me. He stopped saying hi, and he got grim. \nI'd wave, but he gave me the willies. I'd look over, and he'd stare \nat me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn February Muhammad was arrested for shoplifting veggie burgers, \nsteaks and tea worth a total of $27.37 from a Tacoma grocer. Two \nmonths later, he visited an old Army buddy, Robert Edward Holmes, who \nclaims that Muhammad showed him two rifles and a book on silencers, \naccording to the arrest warrant that the feds would later use to nab \nMuhammad. \"Can you imagine the damage you would do if you could shoot \nwith a silencer?\" Muhammad allegedly asked Holmes. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLast summer Muhammad and Malvo left Washington for good and headed \neast. In July they showed up in Baton Rouge, surprising his ex-wife \nCarol. Later that summer he apparently tracked down Mildred despite a \nrestraining order. Vincent Davis, 26, who lives in a town house \nadjacent to Mildred's, says he recalls seeing Muhammad talking to her \nin front of her home three or four months ago. One night more \nrecently, during the weeks of the shootings, another neighbor, Steven \nPerry, 31, saw the blue Caprice parked outside Mildred's house with a \nfigure reclining in the front seat. It appeared that Muhammad was \nmaking the rounds of all his lost homes. But it was the suburbs of \nMaryland, tantalizingly close to the children he had most recently \nlost, that Muhammad allegedly chose as his killing fields. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sept. 10, Muhammad bought the Caprice at a Trenton, N.J., auto \ndealer. \"He was impatient. He talked back rude,\" says Fernando \nMaestre, 20, the salesman who dealt with Muhammad. Even though he \ndidn't ask Muhammad why he was buying a car, Muhammad volunteered \nthree different explanations, Maestre says. First he said he wanted \nit for his son; then he said it was for himself; and finally he said \nhe wanted to use it as a taxi. \"He didn't want us to find out a lot \nabout him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLess than two weeks later, the shootings began, starting in Alabama \nand then clustering around Washington. At least 10 times in three \nweeks, police ran a check on the Caprice's license-plate number but \nnever found any reason to detain the man or the boy, according to the \nWashington Post. With each escape, the pair got bolder. In the \nsniper's letter to the police, after nine killings, the sudden demand \nfor $10 million suggested a tone more giddy than calculated. The \ndemand--to set up an account so the killers could withdraw the money \nfrom any atm in the world with a stolen credit card in their \npossession--was \"preposterous,\" says an investigator. \"He's going to \nget out $300 a day in front of atm cameras?

White House sources \ntell Time that fbi profilers even went over the text of President \nBush's remarks about the sniper last Wednesday to ensure that nothing \nin his speech would \"goad\" the shooter. (Bush had planned to mention \nall the resources that law-enforcement personnel were using to catch \nthe sniper, but, says a senior White House aide, profilers vetoed \nthat approach, thinking that it might tip off the sniper.) The \nalleged killers had even influenced the words of a President. But \nripped from their mobile nest and stripped of their weapons, the \nsuspects were left to contemplate the next chapter in a narrative no \nlonger under their control.

There is something in the story that lures us back to it year \nafter\u0014\nyear; we never seem to grow tired of hearing its message. The main \ncharacter\u0014\nin the story is a surly old man named Scrooge, who lives a miserly\u0014\nexistence. He sees no benefit in being generous with the poor, or even\u0014\nproviding a living wage to dedicated workers. He clutches onto his \nmoney and\u0014\ndespises the thought of parting with any of it. But it is not only \nhis money\u0014\nthat Scrooge withholds from others, it is his entire being. He \nwithholds\u0014\nlove and kindness, he withholds warmth and friendship. Then, one \nnight,\u0014\nScrooge undergoes a profound crisis. He sees himself through the eyes \nof\u0014\nothers. He has a vivid vision of his past; and then his present. But \nwhat is\u0014\nmost frightful to him - what shakes him to the core of his being - is \nwhen\u0014\nhe is granted the opportunity of a lifetime. He is allowed to witness \nhis\u0014\nfuture. But his future proves to be so dark and frightening, that it \nprompts\u0014\nwithin him a dramatic change. He undergoes a radical transformation \nand\u0014\nbecomes an entirely new person. Rather than being cold and \nindifferent to\u0014\npeople, he becomes generous and compassionate.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a heart-warming story. But more than that, it is a hopeful \nstory. It\u0014\nprovides us with the hope that we too can make needed changes in our \nlives.\u0014\nWe can break free from the ruts we have burrowed, and the negative \nbehaviors\u0014\nwe have cultivated. We can become kind and compassionate, humble and\u0014\nhospitable, joyful and generous.\u0014",

    "words": "Bush Is Right on Islam, Robertson Is Wrong\u0014\nBY Robert Parham \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Bush is morally right to continue speaking positively about \nIslam and practicing acts of kindness toward Muslims. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday, the president took off his shoes and entered the Islamic \nCenter of Washington to observe the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy \nmonth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAcknowledging that Ramadan was a time when mercy was practiced, Bush \nsaid that Muslims demonstrate \"a spirit of tolerance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The spirit behind this holiday is a reminder that Islam brings hope \nand comfort to more than a billion people worldwide,\" Bush said. \n\"Islam affirms God's justice and insists on man's moral \nresponsibility. This holiday is also an occasion to remember that \nIslam gave birth to a rich civilization of learning that has \nbenefited mankind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe characterized American Muslims as fellow citizens who \"lead lives \nof honesty and justice and compassion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBush's visit and remarks marked the 17th time since Sept. 11, 2001, \nthat he has noted the peaceful nature of Islam, according to the \nWashington Post.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost recently, Bush told reporters in a mid-November meeting with \nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that \"Islam, as practiced by the \nvast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that \nrespects others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Some of the comments that have been uttered about Islam do not \nreflect the sentiments of my government,\" he said, distancing himself \nfrom the Christian right.\u0014\n\u0014\nBush's comments then drew a sharp and sustained attack from Christian \nfundamentalists.\u0014\nThe most visible and vociferous critic has been TV evangelist Pat \nRobertson, who told the Washington Times that Bush \"is not elected as \nchief theologian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAppearing on ABC's \"This Week\" last Sunday, Robertson stepped up his \nattacks on Bush, accusing the president of \"playing geopolitics\" and \nsinking to \"political correctness.\"\u0014\nRobertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, said Bush was ignoring \nhistory when he refused to point out that Islam is \"violent at its \ncore.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBush's positive statements about Islam have \"caused a great deal of \nconsternation, especially among his base, who know better,\" Robertson \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm one of his biggest supporters. I think I played a significant \nrole in getting him elected,\" claimed Robertson.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerein is the real, albeit unstated, reason that Christian \nfundamentalists are disappointed, even furious, with Bush. They are \nangry that Bush is not using his presidency to promote their \nreligious views. Bush is not acting as the \"evangelist in chief.\" \nBush is not tearing down the wall of separation between church and \nstate to further their cause. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristian fundamentalists believe that if the White House will \ndemonize Islam, then their distorted brand of Christianity has a \nsmoother cruise toward national and international dominion. They \nreason that when the White House speaks well of another religion, it \nmakes their mission much more difficult.\u0014\nWe elected him. He owes us, big time. He should be promoting our \nreligion, so they think. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Bush refuses to cradle Christianity and to crusade for Christian \ndomination, he values the separation of church and state, advances \nreligious liberty for all and retains the role of a political leader, \nnot a religious one. \u0014\n\u0014\nBush is right to give positive regard to Islam. Robertson, Jerry \nFalwell, Franklin Graham and the other fundamentalists are wrong, \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics.\u0014",

    "words": "British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) was a novelist \nlong before he gained fame as a politician. He published Vivian Grey \nin 1826 at the urging of the family of Jane Austen, and although this \nand other works earned him enough money to live on until he entered \ninto politics, they were panned by nearly every critic, dismissed as \ntrashy love stories. Undeterred, Disraeli wrote numerous romantic \nnovels throughout his life, most notably Coningsby, Sybil, and \nTancred. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter losing several elections, Disraeli won a seat in the House of \nCommons in 1837, becoming the first person of Jewish descent in \nBritain to hold elected office. (His family had converted to \nChristianity when he was 17.) He became prime minister in 1868 for a \nshort time, and served again from 1874 to 1878. He was one of \nEngland's most important prime ministers of the 19th century, \ninfluential both in foreign policy and in reshaping the Conservative \nParty.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisraeli was well known for his caustic wit, both in writing and in \nspeaking. In Sybil, he wrote, \"Mr. Kremlin himself was distinguished \nfor ignorance, for he only had one idea--and that was wrong.\" When \nasked why he wrote novels, Disraeli replied that every so often he \nwas overcome by the urge to read a novel, so he would write it \nhimself.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a favorite of Queen Victoria, at least partially because he \nspent hours thinking up compliments for her. (It was largely due to \nhis efforts that she was named Empress of India in 1876.) She even \nvisited his grave shortly after his death in 1881, which was an \nextreme rarity for her.\u0014",

    "words": "Bill Moyers on the costs of war\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Iraq is not Vietnam, but war is war. Some of you \nwill recall that I was press secretary to Lyndon Johnson during the \nescalation of war in Vietnam. Like the White House today, we didn't \ntalk very much about what the war would cost. Not in the beginning. \nWe weren't sure, and we didn't really want to know too soon, anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 If we had to tell Congress and the public the true \ncost of the war, we were afraid of what it would do to the rest of \nthe budget - the money for education, poverty, Medicare. In time, we \nhad to figure it out and come clean. It wasn't the price tag that \nhurt as much as it was the body bag. The dead were coming back in \nsuch numbers that LBJ began to grow morose, and sometimes took to bed \nwith the covers pulled above his eyes, as if he could avoid the \nghosts of young men marching around in his head. I thought of this \nthe other day, when President Bush spoke of the loss of American \nlives in Iraq. He said, \"I'm the one who will have to look the \nmothers in the eye.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 LBJ said almost the same thing. No president can \nhelp but think of the mothers, widows, and orphans. Mr. Bush is \namassing a mighty American armada in the Middle East - incredible \nfirepower. He has to know that even a \"clean war\" - a war fought with \nlaser beams, long-range missles, high-flying bombers, and remote \ncontrols - can get down and dirty, especially for the other side. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 We forget there are mothers on the other side. I've \noften wondered about the mothers of Vietnamese children like this \none, burned by American napalm. Or Afghan mothers, whose children \nwere smashed and broken by American bombs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 On the NBC Nightly News one evening I saw this \nexclusive report from Afghanistan - those little white lights are \nheat images of people on foot. They're about to be attacked. That \nfellow running out in the open - were he and the people killed \nmembers of al Qaeda, or just coming to worship? We'll never know. But \nsurely their mothers do. And there will be mothers like them in Iraq. \nSaddam won't mind - dead or alive, and we won't mind, either. The \nspoils of victory include amnesia. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Ah, the glories of war; the adrenaline that flows to \nmen behind desks at the very thought of the armies that will march, \nthe missiles that will fly, the ships that will sail, on their \ncommand. Our secretary of defense has a plaque on his desk that says, \n\"Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world \naffords.\" I don't think so. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 To launch an armada against Hussein's own hostages, \na people who have not fired a shot at us in anger, seems a crude and \npoor alternative to shrewd, disciplined diplomacy. Don't get me \nwrong. Vietnam didn't make me a dove; it made me read the \nConstitution. That's all. Government's first obligation is to defend \nits citizens. There's nothing in the Constitution that says it's \npermissible for a great nation to go hunting for Hussein by killing \nthe people he holds hostage, his own people, who have no choice in \nthe matter, who have done us no harm. Unprovoked, the noble sport of \nwar becomes the murder of the innocent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 http://www.pbs.org/now/commentary/moyers14.html\u0014",

You will have to look hard to find any who have ever given more \njoy to the world than German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Even now \nmore than 250 years after he died, Bach's music still lifts the heart \nand energizes the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach wrote his music for God. Most of his works are explicitly \nbiblical. The famous missionary doctor Albert Schweitzer, who was \nalso an expert on  Each, called him \"the Fifth Evangelist.\" Bach's \nmusic is indisputably in a league by itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nFine Tuning the Soul\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's heavenly sounds were conceived in a life beset by earthly \nstruggles and trials. Born into a family of musicians, Johann learned \nto sing and play several instrument-; at an early age. But both \nparents died before he as ten. Johann got his first organist job at \nage 17, but even then there were conflict with the church leaders. \nThey insisted that he direct the choir which was notably lacking in \nmusical ability. Already, Bach was writing innovative choral pieces, \nbut his singers couldn't handle them. And he lacked the patience to \nput up with them. One night, Johann even got into a street fight with \none choir member, whom he had called a \"nanny-goat bassoonist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe moved to another church, and a new conflict. Well-meaning Pietists \nwere demanding simple music. Couldn't Bach write something less \nornate -something that would draw attention to God and not to the \nmusic itself. Bach strongly protested that his aim was to create \n\"well-regulated church music to the glory of God.\" He took a new job \nwith the Duke of Weimar, a respected, religious man who appreciated \ngood music. This was a fertile period in Bach's life. He fathered \nseven children and gave birth to a new cantata each month.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeverance Pay?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the relationship with the duke deteriorated. When Bach decided to \ntake anoth- er job, the duke had him arrested and jailed for a month. \nThe struggles continued. Shortly after taking the new job, his wife \ndied, leaving him with a house full of children. A second marriage \nwas a happy one, however. Anna Magdalena supported his musical work, \nsang his com- positions in a bold soprano, and bore him many more \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach lived until age 65, always the feisty musician, fiercely \ndedicated to quality, passionately creating music for the glory of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Cantata a Week?!!\u0014\n\u0014\nBach set before himself and accomplished the seemingly impossible \ntask of preparing a differ- ent cantata for every Sunday for a \nthree-year period. And remember that he not only had to create the \nmusic but also get it copied for the performers and rehearse with \nthem.\u0014",

    "title": "BEYOND THE RIVER -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Celebrating the people of the Underground Railroad, February 9, 2003 \u0014\n                     Reviewer: Carl Westmoreland from Cincinnati, OH \u0014\n\u0014\n                     I have read and reread Beyond the River by Ann \nHagedorn. I have found the book to be\u0014\n                     compelling and believable. Ms. Hagedorn takes us \nbeyond where most Americans are\u0014\n                     comfortable when it comes to examining the \nhistory of slavery, race, gender and class in\u0014\n                     America. With firm, powerful language, and with \ndocumented historical accuracy, she allows\u0014\n                     the reader to understand that Abolition was more \ncomplicated than the hiding of helpless\u0014\n                     people of African decent by the good Whites in \nthe North and the bad Whites in the South.\u0014\n                     Ms. Hagedorn makes us understand that most \nWhites in the North did not support Abolition,\u0014\n                     and most Abolitionists did not support what we \nwould today call integration. \u0014\n                     She immerses the reader in the physical, \npolitical, and cultural landscape of Southwest Ohio,\u0014\n                     Northern Kentucky and the America of the \n1830s-1860s. Her depiction of the \"face off\"\u0014\n                     between the sons of John Rankin, their mother \n(Rankin was out of town during the incident),\u0014\n                     and an armed group that attempted to burn the \nRankin barn places the reader in the middle\u0014\n                     of the action.\u0014\n                     When a man can pass on a noble idea to his sons \nand daughters, as well as to his\u0014\n                     neighbors, he has left a legacy. Sons and \ndaughters often run from the awesome weight\u0014\n                     associated with their parents' \"Moral Crusades.\" \nJohn Rankin's son Lowry resisted his\u0014\n                     father's urgings to become a \"Major\" in the war \nagainst slavery until hi witness the sale of a\u0014\n                     Black woman docked at Ripley (the Kentucky \nborder extends north to the low water mark of\u0014\n                     the Ohio River) to a young man. The young woman \nwas to serve as a mistress, a \"sexual\u0014\n                     toy,\" to her new owner and in the tradition of \nthe day she had no say in the matter. Ms.\u0014\n                     Hagedorn's description of the physical \nexamination of the Black woman who was reduced to\u0014\n                     physical intrusions reserved for prostitiutes, \nfelons and farm animals confronts the reader\u0014\n                     with a major unspoken element of slavery, sexual \nexploitation.\u0014\n                     Interracial cooperation between Black and White \nAbolitionists did not occur on a widespread\u0014\n                     basis in America, but in the region which \nincludes Ripley,Ohio a few partnerships of\u0014\n                     longstanding existed between Rev. John Mahan \n(Sardinia, Ohio), John D. Hudson (Gist\u0014\n                     Settlement), Moses Cumberland, and several other \nBlack people who in the Gist Settlement\u0014\n                     became involved in several violent \nconfrontations with those who assisted the \"Slave\u0014\n                     Regime\". During one confrontation in the Gist \nSettlement during wich time a group of 18\u0014\n                     'vigilantes' were attempting to take Moses \nCumberland into custudy the Black residents, John\u0014\n                     Mahan and his supporters rallied to his support. \nIn the violence that followed John Hudson's\u0014\n                     sister Sally was shot in the back. Un-armed, \nSally Hudson scratched, kicked, bit, fought,\u0014\n                     outfought Grant Lindsey, and another man on \nSunday, April 30, 1839. Breaking free, Sally\u0014\n                     ran towards her home only to be shot, her spine \nsevered: two weeks later she died.\u0014\n                     Ann Hagedorn's pen has revived Sally Hudson's \nbrave story, she has rescued Ms. Hudson\u0014\n                     from obscurity, and the trite images too often \nreserved for women. She captured Sally's fire,\u0014\n                     she has given Sally Hudson's passion for \nfreedom, life and Sally's spirit is as big as that of\u0014\n                     any man who has walked thi earth. Ann Hagedorn \nallows us to legitimately, and with historic\u0014\n                     accuracy, expand the definition of Abolitionist \nHeroes to include women, youth, people of\u0014\n                     African descent, and to understand that the most \nheroic were those who had been enslaved\u0014\n                     and most of the time made the most diffucult \npart of their journey with the help of other\u0014\n                     enslaved people.\u0014\n                     Using the larger than life images of John \nRankin, and John Parker as a palette, Ms.\u0014\n                     Hagedorn celebrates the secret weapon of the \nUnderground Railroad, people of conscience,\u0014\n                     and good will.\u0014\n                     Carl Westmoreland, Senior Advisor, National \nUnderground Freedom Center \u0014\n----------------------------------------------------\u0014\nDr. Martha D. Bone (see more about me) from Maysville, Kentucky USA \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Ann Hagedorn's new book, Beyond The River: The \nUntold Story of the Heroes of the\u0014\n                     Underground Railroad has taken a story people in \nthis area already know and given it flesh\u0014\n                     and blood. Her characters were real, live, \nbreathing human beings, and they come to life\u0014\n                     again in her writing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hagedorn came to live in Ripley, Ohio, to get \nthe flavor of the river and to do research for her\u0014\n                     book. Beyond The River is meticulously \nresearched using primary sources: letters, journals,\u0014\n                     newspaper articles, and memoirs. Beyond The \nRiver is also meticulously written, and the\u0014\n                     descriptions of the land and the people, the \nsuffering and the courage are all engrossing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Most of us have read about the Civil War, but \nHagedorn brings the fifty years leading up the\u0014\n                     war right into our living rooms, where in fact \nthey did occur. I have always known, of course,\u0014\n                     that the Ohio River is part of the Mason-Dixon \nline which divides north from south, but I never\u0014\n                     considered people from Maysville and Mayslick \nand Augusta actually attacking the folks\u0014\n                     across the river in Ripley and Georgetown. \nRuffians, bounty hunters, and slave catchers\u0014\n                     from the slave state of Kentucky did just that. \nSome of the wealthiest families in the area\u0014\n                     supported slavery, and some of the wealthiest \nfamilies in Ripley were closet abolitionists.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The community of these people who risked life \nand family to help the oppressed was a new\u0014\n                     idea to me. Rankin involved his entire family, \nof course, but other large families in the area\u0014\n                     and on the Ripley line as it ran north were also \ninvolved. Many of these families intermarried\u0014\n                     and were otherwise associated. Adam Lowry, John \nand Jean Rankin's oldest son, was\u0014\n                     attending Lane Theological Seminary in \nCincinnati when he fell ill and could not take a\u0014\n                     hidden slave north. He wasn't sure whom he could \ntrust except for Professor Calvin Stowe.\u0014\n                     Stowe had never been involved in the Underground \nRailroad, but he stepped into the\u0014\n                     breech. And he, of course, was the husband of \nHarriet Beecher Stowe.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Hagedorn tells the story of Eliza, the escaped \nslave who returned to rescue her daughter and\u0014\n                     grandchildren from slavery, risking her own \nhard-earned freedom. Harriet Beecher Stowe\u0014\n                     combined this story with others for her \nfictional Eliza. But Hagedorn reveals the irritating fact\u0014\n                     that Eliza's daughter wouldn't leave without two \nto three hundred pounds (!) of goods that\u0014\n                     she had saved all her life. This attachment to \nmaterial goods made the escape much more\u0014\n                     difficult, and Eliza's daughter and six \ngrandchildren had to hide for an entire day, with dogs\u0014\n                     and slave catchers searching for them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     One thing I simply cannot imagine is getting \naway from slavery and then going back for other\u0014\n                     people. This, I believe, is the highest form of \nbravery. The white people who worked on the\u0014\n                     Ripley line risked their lives, their \nlivelihood, and their families. They risked being jailed for\u0014\n                     aiding \"property\" to escape. Some were, in fact, \njailed for long periods of time. Many died\u0014\n                     while in jail. But the free black people and the \nescaped slaves who went back into slave\u0014\n                     territory to help others risked all these things \nas well as being enslaved again. Hagedorn tells\u0014\n                     us about Billy Marshall, Polly Ann Jackson \nCaldwell, Eliza, and John Parker. They could have\u0014\n                     gone north to Canada and rested in safety, but \nthey chose the better path.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     There are many more stories in Beyond The River: \nThe Untold Story of the Heroes of the\u0014\n                     Underground Railroad. Many people worked on the \nRipley line, and Ann Hagedorn has\u0014\n                     included them. As she has done, readers should \ngo to the source-a beautifully written,\u0014\n                     engrossing, and inspiring book.\u0014",

    "title": "BENEDICT ARNOLD: WAR TIME HERO OR BITTER TRAITOR?",
    "words": "At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in April 1775, Col. Benedict \nArnold received permission to attack the British at Fort Ticonderoga. \nHearing that Ethan Allen was advancing on the fort independently, \nArnold rushed there without his troops and tried to assume command. \nAllen agreed to share command, and the two leaders achieved a key \nvictory for the colonists. Arnold, however, was angered that Allen \nreceived most of the credit, and that civilian authorities did not \nreimburse him properly for his expenses. This self-interest \nultimately ruined what otherwise would have been an exemplary \nmilitary career. \u0014\n\u0014\nArnold's next plan, capturing the city of Quebec, failed, but the \nattack did keep British forces in Quebec aaaaaaaaaaaaa up for six \nmonths. Promoted to brigadier general for his gallantry during the \nbattle, Arnold then defeated superior British forces in two naval \nengagements on Lake Champlain, thwarting a British plan to divide the \ncolonies. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite George Washington's support, other generals disapproved of \nArnold's brash style, and the Continental Congress promoted five \njunior officers over him. Dissuaded from resigning by Washington, \nArnold was victorious again in 1777, breaking the British siege of \nFort Stanwix and leading an unauthorized charge at Saratoga that \ncontributed to one of the most important victories of the war. \u0014\nNo longer able to fight because of injuries suffered at Quebec and \nSaratoga, Arnold grew increasingly bitter over his wartime debts and \nCongress's snubs. In 1780, he obtained command of the strategic fort \nWest Point--intending to sell it to Britain for the modern equivalent \nof $1 million. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen British intelligence officer Maj. John Andre was captured with \nevidence of Arnold's plan, the general fled, leaving Andre to be \nhanged as a spy. From that point on, not even Loyalists trusted \nArnold, and he moved to England, where he received land and a \npension. Nevertheless, he complained constantly about money until his \ndeath.\u0014",

    "title": "BASTILLE: GUEST HOUSE OF THE KING",
    "words": "Despite its age-old reputation as a place of terror and torture, the \nBastille was not all that different from a modern-day country club \nprison. It was built in 1370 as a fortress--not as a prison--so its \ninmates were legally considered \"guests\" of the French king, and \nenjoyed privileges inconceivable to ordinary prisoners. Torture was \nunheard of. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe great majority of the Bastille's inmates were harmless \"enemies \nof the state,\" meaning forgers, debtors, blackmailers, and political \ndissidents whom the government preferred to stash away rather than \nbring to trial. Noble families also occasionally asked to have \ntroublesome relatives held. Over the years the \"guest list\" also \nincluded such celebrated writers as Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost accommodations in the eight huge towers had high ceilings, \nfireplaces, and large (albeit barred) windows. Rooms were minimally \nfurnished, but if the prisoner preferred he could bring his own \nappointments, including paintings, musical instruments, and extensive \nlibraries. If they could afford them, inmates were even allowed \nservants, who received a pension from the king if they agreed to \nserve as long as their masters were incarcerated. \u0014\nThe most distinguished inmates were allowed to entertain, and \nimprisoned nobility threw balls as grand as anything given outside \nthe prison walls. Food was plentiful and well prepared, with menus \nthat might include crawfish bisque, sweetbreads, and dessert. Wine \nflowed freely. \u0014\n\u0014\nThose with less influence were less comfortable, and could be \npunished for any infraction of the rules. They might be chained for \nweeks at a time and made to sleep on straw, but their jailors did not \ndiscipline them beyond reasonable rules. Nor were they deprived of \ndecent food and drink. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the famous storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, at the \nbeginning of the French Revolution, the angry mob found only seven \nprisoners (none political) to liberate--four forgers, a libertine, \nand two madmen. One of the latter had drunk 167 bottles of wine, 121 \nbottles of \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein, and 12 \nbottles of brandy in just three months.\u0014",

Many Englishmen blamed their new king for the boy's \nsubsequent death, sowing the seeds of mistrust that would lead to a \ndevastating battlefield betrayal two years later. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wars of the Roses--the dispute between the houses of York and \nLancaster for control of the English throne--had been raging for 30 \nyears by the time Henry Tudor challenged the Yorkist king Richard III \nin the summer of 1485. The odds seemed to be against Tudor and his \nforce of 6,000: He had little military experience compared with the \nking, and when the two sides met near the village of Market Bosworth \non August 22, Richard had the better position and an army twice the \nsize of Tudor's. The king had lined 10,000 men along the top of a \nhill and another 4,000 men under the command of Sir William Stanley \nand his brother, Lord Thomas Stanley, on his flank. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Richard didn't know was that the Stanleys secretly had pledged \ntheir support to Tudor before the battle. After an initial exchange \nof archery and artillery fire, the two sides' infantries engaged in \nclose combat. Richard then ordered the Stanleys' troops to join his \nown and end the Lancaster threat, but not only did Lord Thomas refuse \nto engage, Sir William actually attacked Richard's flank. As the \nYorkist army quickly began to break ranks, the desperate king charged \nstraight at Tudor, killing his rival's bodyguard before being \nunhorsed and killed. (Shakespeare depicted the fallen king crying \nout, \"My kingdom for a horse!\") \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the coronation following the battle of Bosworth Field, Sir William \nStanley placed the crown of England on Henry Tudor, who became Henry \nVII.

They wrote a \nthank-you note and stowed the Bible away on a closet shelf.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs time passed, the grandfather repeatedly asked the couple how they \nliked the Bible. The rancher was confused as to how to respond. \nHadn't he already expressed his appreciation? But the grandfather \npersisted. Eventually, the young man dug out the gift. As he leafed \nthrough it, $20 bills fluttered out, 66 in allone at the beginning \nof Genesis and in each succeeding book.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the rancher had left a monetary treasure waiting to be \ndiscovered, he had also left something even more valuable untouched \nbetween those pages: spiritual riches. All because he had not opened \nthe Book.\u0014\nIn American homes the Bible has taken on the status of an icon with \nlittle practical value. When asked, \"What book has most influenced \nyour life?\" in a recent Library of Congress survey, respondents \nawarded the Bible the top position. But only 34 percent of American \nChristians read God's Word on their own during the week, and of that \ngroup, only 13 percent claim to read it daily. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Americans revere the Bible,\" says pollster George Gallup, Jr., \"but, \nby and large, they don't read it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy not?\u0014\n\u0014\nExcuses, excuses\u0014\nReading the Bible is not illegal here as it is in Laos.

It doesn't cost a \nweek's wages to obtain a copy as it does in the Philippines.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we do not battle external obstacles to reading the Biblesuch \nas laws or financial restrictionswe face internal barriers every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps you rank among the majority of Americans who do not read the \nBible regularly. You've considered it, been exhorted to try it, and \neven attempted it a few times, yet you can't seem to make it a habit. \nWhat can you do?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we truly believe that the Bible is divinely inspired and that it \ninstructs us in righteous living and equips us for every good work (2 \nTim. 3:16-17), then we should be eager to delve deep into it pages. \nUnfortunately, even though we understand intellectually that reading \nthe Bible will help us grow spiritually, we can't quite seem to get \naround those internal obstacles. Here are seven excuses that prevent \nus from cracking the Bookand how to overcome them.\u0014\n\u0014\n1 \"I don't have time to read.\"\u0014\nBut we do have timeif we read in spurts. Unleashing Connection \nreports that in one year, the average American reads 3,000 forms or \nnotices, 100 newspapers, and 36 magazinesbut only three books. These \ntrends suggest why the USA Today format is so popular. We like to get \nour information in short doses that are easy to digest.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Half the books of the Bible can be read in 10 to 45 minutes each, \nand many of them can be read in less than 20,\" says Nashville-based \npastor and author Robert Morgan. \"The entire Old and New Testaments \ncan be read aloud slowly and with expression in less than 71 hours.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRead just one chapter of the Bible each day, and in a month you will \nhave completed the book of Proverbs (31 chapters) once or the epistle \nof James (five chapters) six times.\u0014\n\u0014\n2 \"I don't know where to begin.\"\u0014\nIf starting \"In the beginning\" with Genesis seems too daunting, flip \nto the Psalms or Proverbs and start there. Or begin your journey in \nthe New Testament with Matthew. You can also poll Bible-reading \nfriends and ask them what their favorite book isthen try reading it. \nOr use a Bible with a built-in reading plan, such as The One-Year \nBible (Tyndale House) or The Daily Bible (Harvest House). These \ndevotional Bibles present Scripture in manageable portions and work \nthrough it in logical sequences.\u0014\n\u0014\n3 \"I just don't get it.\"\u0014\nMany of us think of the Bible as a technical manual written in \nChristian-ese. But there are \"biblical help\" buttons a reader can \npush to get some quick guidance:\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslations. Choose an easy-to-read translation, like the New \nInternational Reader's Version (nirv; written at a third-grade level) \nor a paraphrase, like The New Living Translation (NLT) .\u0014\n\u0014\nReference tools. Invest in a few basic references, such as a Bible \ndictionary(an index of biblical-word definitions) a Bible atlas (a \ncollection of maps of biblical lands), and a concordance (a biblical \nword locator) to bring clarity to the text.\u0014\n\u0014\n4 \"The Bible is so dull.\"\u0014\nNot if you enjoy romance (Ruth), adventure (Jonah, Acts), or conflict \n(Judges). There are tales of conquest and war (Joshua), scandal and \nsuspense (David and Bathsheba in 2 Samuel), and deceit and corruption \n(Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5).\u0014\n\u0014\nGod stocked his library with a variety of genres: narrative, letters, \npoetry, history, and prophecy. If you naturally gravitate to the \nbiography section in a bookstore, start with the Gospels (Matthew, \nMark, Luke and John). If you love poetry, spend some time exploring \nPsalms or Song of Solomon.\u0014\n\u0014\n5 \"I don't see how the Bible applies to my life.\"\u0014\nThe Bible offers practical advice on issues we face every day: love \n(1 Corinthians 13), leadership (Nehe-miah), marital bliss (Song of \nSolomon), courage (Esther), and investments (Matthew 25). It has \nhow-to articles (Proverbs 31) and time-management models (Matthew \n6:33).\u0014\n\u0014\nGet a topical Bible (a Bible arranged according to subject) and read \nevery passage about an issue that challenges you. Take notes as you \nread. Become an expert on what the Scriptures say about that \nparticular subject.\u0014\n\u0014\n6 \"I hear Bible readings in church every Sunday. Isn't that enough?\"\u0014\n\"The Bible,\" says Billy Graham, \"is the road map for life.\" When I \nexamine a map, an expert like my pastor can show me the most \neffective route to take. But I become more familiar with how to \nnavigate the roadlifewhen I read the map and follow it myself.\u0014\n\u0014\n7 \"The Bible makes me feel uncomfortable.\"\u0014\nMany of us associate the Bible with negative experiences. Instead of \nexamining Scripture on its own merits, we plop it onto a \"discard \npile\" along with dry worship, hypocritical congregations, and \ninsensitive Christians from our past. We'd rather label it and put it \nin a box than face up to what it might be telling us about ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut conviction is an important and necessary function of Scripture. \n\"For the word of God is living and active,\" says the writer of \nHebrews. \"Sharper than any double-edged sword . . . it judges the \nthoughts and attitudes of the heart\" (4:12, NIV).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we read the Bible we may find we have to face some hard truths \nabout ourselves and our inner motives. Is that worthwhile? Said the \nancient Greek philosopher Plato, \"The life which is unexamined is not \nworth living.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStatistics say that 92 percent of all Americans have at least three \nBibles in their homes. Perhaps like the South Dakota rancher, yours \nis secreted away in a closet. And like him, you don't suspect that \nthere's a fortune hidden within its pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's a priceless treasure within your reach right now. Get it off \nthe shelf and read it today.\u0014\n\u0014\nReprinted from Signs of the Times (October 2002),  2002 Kathy \nWidenhouse.\u0014",

    "words": "There was once a term frequently used in the church. In the old days \nit was used often. You rarely ever hear it today. Indeed, in my 12 \nyears in the ministry I have never preached a sermon on the topic \nuntil now. Despite the infrequency with which it is mentioned, the \nconcept, I think, is still valid. It is backsliding.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term backsliding, I discovered in my research, was popularized in \nthe 1600's by John Bunyan in his very famous allegory Pilgrim's \nProgress. In the story, you may recall, the character of Christian \nand Hopeful are on their religious pilgrimage. While on the journey \nthey begin to discuss an individual by the name of Temporary. He had \nstarted the pilgrimage, but along the way he fell by the wayside, or, \nas Banyan worded it, backslid. That term was picked up, particularly, \nbut not exclusively by the Methodists in early America and became a \nstock phrase. It referred to those once faithful individuals who had \nlost interest in their Christian pilgrimage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are some denominations who do not affirm the concept. They say \nonce saved always saved. Methodists have never affirmed that, because \nit implies that if a person becomes a Christian then he loses his \nfree will to turn away. The individual who was free to choose the way \nof Christ, we insist, is still free to turn his back on it. Man can \nexperience no level of grace that is beyond the possibility of \nfalling.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can then understand why in verse 66 of chapter 6 we read that \nmany of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. Notice \nwhat is said, they turned back! They quit following. They became \nTemporary. I don't think a single reason can be identified as to why \nso many stopped following, a combination of issues probably, as we \nhave already note: His teaching confused some. His images offended \nothers. But primarily, I think it was his claim to be the new source \nof life, his claim to be greater than Moses, a new Manna. Either way, \nthey weren't buying it and they left. Just like that. One day they \nwere disciples and the next they were not. They became backsliders.\u0014",

Dr. Eskew \ntaught at NOBTS for almost four decades and is a prolific writer on \nBaptist hymnology.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Amazing Gifts of Baptist Singing School Teachers\u0014\nBy Harry Eskew\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists often take their musical heritage for granted. Many of us \nhardly have an inkling of the kind of contributions our fellow \nbelievers made to worship as we know it today and to the worship \nrepertoire of many other denominations. Some of our hymns and hymn \ntunes have gained great acceptance in our churches and in other \nchurches and have even spilled over into the non-religious venues of \nour society. Especially the Baptist singing school teachers of the \nnineteenth century made rich deposits into our treasury of hymn tunes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1800s, before the development of music education in \npublic schools, the most common means of learning to read vocal music \nwas the singing school. Singing schools were taught by itinerant \nteachers who held schools of a week or two in churches and other \ncommunity buildings. About 1800 the invention of shape notes enabled \nbeginners in singing schools to learn to read music more quickly. The \nshapes stood for the solmization syllables, either the earlier \nfa-sol-la system or the later do-re-mi system. By learning the \nshapes, singers were able to avoid the complexities of mastering key \nsignatures and the letters of the lines and spaces. A typical singing \nschool textbook, called a tunebook, consisted of an introduction \nexplaining the rudiments of music and an anthology of up to several \nhundred pieces of music, mostly settings of sacred texts. Tunebooks \nwere not commonly used in worship services, but they nevertheless \ncontained music suitable for church use. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning about the second decade of the nineteenth century, along \nwith the earlier mixture of psalm and hymn tunes, fuging tunes, and \nanthems found in singing school tunebooks of the Northeast, there \nappeared a fresh type of tune based on Anglo-American folk tradition \ncommonly known today as a folk hymn. Based on a style derived from \noral tradition, folk hymns were notated and harmonized in a sturdy \npioneer style of harmony and published by singing school masters in \nshape-note tunebooks, especially in the South and Midwest. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the shape-note tradition moved into the South from Pennsylvania \nthrough the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia into Tennessee, South \nCarolina, and Georgia, two of the most significant of the shape-note \ntunebook compilers were Baptists. In a sense, what Bach and \nPalestrina had done by creating their great choral masterworks for \nLutherans and Roman Catholics, Baptist musicians William Walker and \nBenjamin Franklin White accomplished by providing miniature \nmasterworks of congregational tunes for rural and small-town America.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Walker (1809-1875) of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is best \nknown for his tunebook, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion \n(1835, later eds. to 1854). Among the folk hymn tunes Walker \npublished for the first time in The Southern Harmony are RESTORATION, \nthe tune to Come, ye sinners, poor and needy, WONDROUS LOVE, to the \ntext What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul (1840 ed.), \nand THE PROMISED LAND,\u0014\n\u0014\nthe original minor-key setting of On Jordans stormy banks I stand. \nPerhaps Walkers greatest contribution in The Southern Harmony, \nhowever, is his wedding of the text of Amazing Grace to its now \nfamiliar tune from the folk hymn tradition, which Walker named NEW \nBRITAIN. \u0014\n\u0014\nWalkers brother-in-law, Benjamin Franklin White (1800-1879), born \nnear Spartanburg, moved about 1840 to Hamilton, in western Georgia, \nwhere in 1844 he published with Elisha J. King The Sacred Harp, which \nafter the Civil War became the Souths leading shape-note tunebook. \nKing died shortly after The Sacred Harp was published. White, \nhowever, lived more than three decades after its publication and \nexerted considerable influence on the revisions (in 1850, 1859, and \n1869) and on the establishment of singing conventions to support \nSacred Harp singing. The Sacred Harp is by far the most popular of \nshape-note tunebooks, and in the closing decades of the twentieth \ncentury its use spread from the South to practically all of the \nUnited States and into Canada. In contrast, Walkers Southern Harmony \nis used mainly in a famous annual singing at Benton, Kentucky, and \nhis later tunebook, Christian Harmony (1867), is used in singings in \nMississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and western North Carolina. Two folk \nhymn tunes which were first published in The Sacred Harp are \nWARRENTON (\"Come, thou fount of every blessing\") and \"BEACH SPRING, a \nmelody now used with a number of hymn texts, including Jesus, at \nyour holy table, Come, all Christians, be committed, Lord, whose \nlove in humble service, and We are travlers on a journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther shape-note tunes of the Anglo-American folk tradition published \nin The Southern Harmony, The Sacred Harp, and other early tunebooks \nfound in hymnals of today include FOUNDATION (\"How firm a \nfoundation\"), \"HOLY MANNA\" (Brethren, we have met to worship and \nGod, who stretched the spangled heavens) and \"NETTLETON (\"Come, \nthou fount of every blessing\"). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe amazing impact of these Baptist singing school teachers on our \nworship becomes clear when we realize that practically every American \nhymnal published in the last thirty years includes a number of folk \nhymns from Walkers Southern Harmony, White and Kings The Sacred \nHarp and other early shape-note tunebooks. The legacy of Baptist \nsinging-school teachers such as William Walker, Elisha J. King, and \nBenjamin Franklin White has immeasurably enriched the music of \ncongregational song in America today. Who could have foreseen that at \nleast one of the folk hymns of that era would cross all social and \neducational lines, be embraced by presidents, pop artists, opera \nsingers, jazz musicians, and prison choirs, and become the subject of \nbooks and documentaries?\u0014",

Revivalism was \nan effort to reach the masses for Christ, ranging from the frontier \ncamp meetings of the early nineteenth century to the urban revivalism \nof the latter nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Sunday school \nwas an evangelistic effort focused on reaching children with the \nmessage of the Christian faith. The gospel hymn was the product of \nthese two movements, which were often inseparable in practice, each \nbeing energized by the other. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Reaching the uneducated masses \nrequired simple, personal hymns in popular musical styles that could \nbe easily learned and remembered. These hymns were characterized by \nfrequent repetitions and refrains. When Ira D. Sankey, the associate \nof  Dwight L. Moody, compiled a hymnal in the 1870s containing these \nsimple hymns, he entitled it Gospel Hymns. Thus was born the enduring \nterm for these hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Although the roots of the gospel hymn \nlie in the frontier revivals of the early decades of the nineteenth \ncentury, they are more immediately traceable to the rapidly growing \nSunday school movement from about the 1850s, for which numerous small \nrectangular-shaped collections with both words and music were \npublished. Perhaps the most influential of the composer-compilers of \nthe Sunday school songs was the Baptist William B. Bradbury of New \nYork City. He composed the music to Jesus Loves Me, the most \npopular of all childrens hymns. Also in Bradburys Sunday school \nsongbooks were his tunes to He leadeth me, Sweet hour of prayer, \nJust as I am, My hope is built on nothing less, and Savior, like \na shepherd lead us. Others who contributed significantly to Sunday \nschool collections were the Baptist pastor Robert Lowry, writer of \nboth words and music to Shall we gather at the river, and the \nBaptist layman  William Howard Doane, particularly known for his \nmusical settings of Fanny Crosbys hymns, such as To God be the \nglory, great things he hath done.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Beginning in the 1870s the \nSunday school hymns were republished in the collection Gospel Hymns \nand came to be known as gospel hymns or gospel songs. Two Baptists \ncollaborated with Sankey in this famous collection of revival hymns. \nPhilip Paul Bliss, one of the most gifted of the gospel hymn \ncomposers, wrote the words and music to  Wonderful Words of Life \nand the music to It Is Well with My Soul. George C. Stebbins was \nthe composer of the music to Jesus is tenderly calling thee home \nand Have thine own way, Lord.\u0014\n \u0014\n                                      The dominant stream of early \ngospel hymnody represented by each of these hymnists was in the \nNortheast.  A pioneer Southern Baptist gospel hymnist was the \nevangelist William E. Penn, a revival preacher and hymnist \ncontemporary with Moody and Sankey whose ministry was in the \nSouthwest. Penn wrote both words and music to There is a Rock in a \nweary land, found in the 1975 Baptist Hymnal\u0014\n.\u0014\n                                      As these hymns, originally \nwritten for use in Sunday schools and revival meetings, came to be \nused in the regular worship services of Baptist churches, they gained \nsuch a dominant position that they threatened to crowd out the \nstandard hymns that had been used for many generations. This concern \nwas well expressed by the Baptist leader and hymnal compiler Basil \nManley, Jr. in 1891: \u0014\n                          For some years it has been apparent that \nthe rage for novelties in singing, especially in our Sunday schools, \nhas been driving out of use the old precious, standard hymns. They \nare not even contained in the undenominational songbooks which in \nmany churches have usurped the place of our old hymn books. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Manleys lament can still be \nheard in Baptist churches of today. Gospel hymnody has continued to \nbe widely used among Southern Baptists throughout the twentieth \ncentury and beyond. Revivalism and the Sunday School movements fueled \nthe change in the hymn repertory of the church leading to the \ninclusion of gospel hymns. The conflict between the old and the new \ndescribed by Manly continues in the church today. How can our hymnals \nprovide an appropriate selection of hymns representing the rich hymn \nheritage of the church with an appropriate selection of hymns in  \ncontemporary styles?\u0014",

For\u0014\n                     decades their stories were largely myths, \ncontaining a combination of popular folklore and carefuly crafted FBI \nfables. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     In recent years historians have generated a more \nfactual look at the life and times of the various Depression-era \ndesperados. Until now\u0014\n                     Baby Face Nelson has remained as enigmatic and \none-dimensional as he was then, portrayed by J.

Finally the full story of his short \nlife can be told. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Using new information that comes from the \nformerly classified files of the FBI, the Nelson who emerges from the \npages of Baby Face\u0014\n                     Nelson: Portrait of a Public Enemy is a more \nparadoxical and interesting figure than one might expect.

In a surprising\u0014\n                     departure from the gangster norm, Nelson and his \nwife remained fiercely devoted to one another, and between holdups \nthey often lived a\u0014\n                     quiet domestic life with their two children and, \nat times, Nelsons mother. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The main focus of this biography is on Nelsons \nremarkable criminal career, from sensational bank robberies and \nblazing gun battles up to\u0014\n                     his death at the age of twenty-five.

A babysitter and trusted neighbor confessed that \nhe bludgeoned a 9-year-old girl to death with a brick and then \ndismembered her, hiding her head, hands and feet at his home and \ndumping the rest of her remains nearby, police said Tuesday. \u0014\n\u0014\nAllen County sheriff's investigators said in an affidavit that \nMichael Plumadore, 39, admitted he killed Aliahna Lemmon last Friday. \u0014\nAccording to the affidavit, Plumadore told police that after beating \nAliahna to death, he stuffed her body into trash bags and hid her in \nthe freezer at his trailer. He said he later chopped up her body and \nstuffed her remains into freezer bags. \u0014\n\u0014\nPolice said Plumadore told them he had hidden Aliahna's head, feet \nand hands at his trailer and that he had discarded her other remains \nat a nearby business.

He has yet to be formally charged in Aliahna's \ndeath. \u0014\n\u0014\nAliahna and her two younger sisters were staying with Plumadore, a \nneighbor, because their mother had been sick with the flu. \u0014\n\u0014\nPlumadore told The Journal Gazette on Sunday that Aliahna disappeared \nfrom his home Friday morning while he was sleeping after having gone \nto a gas station about a mile away to buy a cigar.

    "words": "January 4, 1809 \u0014\nBlind Louis Braille Gave Reading to the Blind\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAt four o'clock in the morning on this day, January 4, 1809, in \nCoupvray, France, a local midwife eased tiny Louis Braille into the \nworld. Louis was the fourth child of his mother, Monique, and his \nfather Simon, a leather worker. The pair formed a sturdy middle-class \ncouple, devout and prosperous. But the boy appeared frail, so they \narranged to have him baptized right away.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis quickly showed himself to be a bright-eyed child, prying into \neverything. The early death that had been feared for him did not \nhappen. However, another disaster struck. Three-year-old Louis had \nbeen warned not to play with his father's tools. But temptation was \nstrong. One day, when no one was looking, he took up a sharp knife \nand tried to cut a piece of leather. The blade slipped, gouging one \nof his eyes. The wound became dangerously infected. Then the \ninfection spread to his good eye. Louis was blind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe town's old priest died. Father Jacques Palluy took his place. He \nsaw the potential of young Louis and began to teach him. Afterward, \nPalluy arranged for a newly appointed schoolmaster to instruct Louis. \nThe good priest later got Louis admitted to the Royal Institution for \nBlind Youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the institute, Louis proved to be an apt pupil. In addition to his \nregular subjects, he learned to play the piano. Playing religious \nmusic on the organ would become one of the joys of his later life.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain Barbier introduced a system of raised dots to the Royal \nInstitute. It had serious flaws. Young Louis was still just a boy, \nbut he set out to solve the problems of Barbier's system. The captain \nwas reluctant to accept suggestions from a boy, so Louis began to \nexperiment at night. At fifteen, he created the world's first really \ngood system for blind reading. At nineteen years of age, he developed \na Braille system of writing music. At twenty, he was a teacher at his \nown school.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn writing of his own system, Louis never sought glory, happy to \nremind his readers how much he owed to Captain Barbier. This, despite \nthe fact that Barbier fought Louis' system and tried to get his own \nmethod made the official medium of instruction. Louis showed true \nsaintliness. His frustration must have been great, because teachers, \nafraid of losing their jobs, also resisted the improved system.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeeply modest, Louis hid his many acts of kindness and charity. These \nwere often sacrificial. For instance, he gave up a position he loved, \nplaying organ for a church, simply because another blind person \nneeded it more than he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis developed tuberculosis in young manhood. As he lay dying he \nsaid, \"God was pleased to hold before my eyes the dazzling splendors \nof eternal hope. After that, doesn't it seem that nothing more could \nkeep me bound to the earth?\" He asked for final communion about \nmidday on January 6, 1852. After three and a half hours of agony late \nthat afternoon, he died at seven-thirty in the evening.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFeldman, Anthony. Scientists & Inventors.

    "title": "BILL OF RIGHTS GUARANTEED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY",
    "words": "December 15, 1791 \u0014\nBill of Rights Guaranteed Religious Liberty\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1787 a convention in Philadelphia drafted what is usually \nrecognized as the most extraordinary political document of history. \nThe Constitution of the United States created a federal system with \nchecks and balances on power. The world had never seen anything like \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite its benefits, there was doubt it would be ratified by the \nindividual states. Having recently escaped one tyranny, the people of \nthe United States did not want to subject themselves to another. They \nfeared the new constitution because, while it specified the rights of \nthe new government, and gave such rights as the writ of habeas \ncorpus, it did not list other rights that the people felt it should. \nThese could be inferred, but the majority of Americans felt safer \nhaving them spelled out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the most part, those who were for the federal system were for the \nconstitution as it stood. Those who opposed a federal system, wanted \nmore guarantees of rights. Several state conventions asked for such a \nbill. Thomas Jefferson urged that they be given their wish. A \"bill \nof rights is what the people are entitled to against every government \non earth, general or particular, and what no just government should \nrefuse, or rest on inference.\" The U. S. Congress agreed and by a two \nthirds majority passed ten amendments to the constitution, called the \nBill of Rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified. It \nis significant to church history because of its first Amendment: \n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof..\" This amendment was the \nresult of long centuries of efforts by religious groups such as the \nQuakers and Baptists to obtain religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first amendment meant that the Federal government of the United \nStates could not establish a national church, such as was common in \nmany other nations. Anyone could worship as he or she pleased and the \nFederal government could not say \"boo\" except under special \ncircumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederal civil rights are not obligatory for states, however. At the \nstate level, established churches continued to exist for some years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany battles have been fought in the courts over just what this \namendment means. Today, when its words are used as an excuse to \nforbid children to pray in school or read a Bible on school property, \nit is good to remember that in the understanding of the generation \nthat adopted the amendment was not that the government should oppose \nreligion or deny it the same rights of expression enjoyed by other \norganizations, but rather that it not impose a national religion nor \nstop people from engaging in their preferred form of worship. It \nguaranteed freedomfor worship, not freedom from religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bill of Rights in the United States of America.\" \nhttp://www.magnacartaplus.org/usa-rights/\u0014\nBowen, Catherine Drinker.

Rather, the phrase represents an \nunderstanding of the First Amendment, popularized (but not invented) \nby a correspondence between a Baptist church and President Thomas \nJefferson.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1801, the Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut wrote a letter to \nJefferson, claiming that Connecticuts outdated state constitution \ndidnt prohibit the government from meddling with religious affairs \nthrough legislature. The state was abusing that lack of prohibition, \ndespite the freedom of religion offered to all citizens in the \nConstitution of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe letter from the church said, Religion is at all times and places \na matter between God and individuals, that no man ought to suffer in \nname, person, or effects on account of his religious opinions, [and] \nthat the legitimate power of civil government extends no further than \nto punish the man who works ill to his neighbor. But sir, our \nconstitution of government is not specific. Our ancient charter, \ntogether with the laws made coincident therewith, were adapted as the \nbasis of our government at the time of our revolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jeffersons famous reply helped create the often misunderstood \nwall that is the separation of church and state:\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely \nbetween man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his \nfaith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach \nactions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign \nreverence that act of the whole American people which declared that \ntheir legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a \nwall of separation between church and State.\u0014\n\u0014\nLets take a look at why Thomas Jefferson interpreted the First \nAmendment this way. The whole amendment states:\u0014\n\u0014\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to \nassemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe establishment clause (the section that says, no law respecting \nan establishment of religion) has, historically, been broadly \napplied to the federal government, which in turn applies to state \ngovernments through the due process clause (which states that no \nperson shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due \nprocess of law) of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court \nultimately decides how far these protections reach.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts worth noting, here, that many of the colonists who settled in \nNorth America (perhaps most notably, the Puritans) were actually \nfleeing state-established religionsthe Church of England and the \nRoman Catholic Churchwhen they came here. The unification of church \nand state historically resulted in the persecution of those who did \nnot share the religious beliefs of the state. The cultural and \ndenominational melting pot of America would not allow the formation \nof another government that dictated what its citizens could believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, the wall Jefferson interpreted in the amendment was to \nprotect the diversity of beliefs in the United States and to prevent \nthe perpetuation of persecution for religious beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, however, some people see this wall as the source of \npersecution in the United States.\u0014",

    "words": "November 28, 1628 \u0014\nBestselling Author, John Bunyan\u0014\nCurtis, Lang, Peterson\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bunyan was born in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England on this day, \nNovember 28, 1628. His home was a small thatched cottage, and his \nfather was a tinker, who spent his days pushing a cart along the \nroads, stopping at homes to fix metal pots and pans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung John received a grammar-school education, but like most sons of \nhis day, he learned his father's trade. During the English Civil War \nhe served as a soldier-- probably on the Puritan side. At nineteen he \nmarried, and his Christian wife led him to try to reform his life. \nBut John found himself constantly slipping back into old habits. \nThough he lived well enough to impress his neighbors, he described \nhimself as a \"painted hypocrite.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1651, John began attending an independent meeting at Bedford and \nwas moved by the pastor's intense biblical preaching. He began to \npore over the Scriptures, until the conflict within him ended in the \nassurance of God's grace in his life. Salvation had come to John \nBunyan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined the Bedford congregation and began to preach there, amazing \npeople at the abilities of a \"mere\" tinker. Though King Charles II \nhad at first promised freedom of religion, increasingly the Anglican \nchurch became England's only accepted church. Dissent was not \nencouraged, and in 1661 the authorities sent John to Bedford jail for \nhis preaching. His times in prison were hard on his family and his \nblind daughter. He remained there until 1672, when Charles issued the \nDeclaration of Indulgence, extending leniency to non-Anglicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his release, the Independent meeting house called him as their \npastor. He received a license to preach and became known as Bishop \nBunyan-- perhaps becoming the organizing genius of Independents in \nthe area, But the toleration was not to last.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1675 Bunyan again found himself in prison, and began his greatest \nwork: The Pilgrim's Progress. This allegory of salvation and the \nChristian walk has given us such colorful phrases as \"Vanity Fair,\" \n\"the Slough of Despond,\" \"House Beautiful,\" \"Muckraking,\" and, \n\"Hanging is too good for him.\" Drawing only on his own experience and \nthe Bible, this largely unlettered preacher created a captivating \npiece of literature that appeals to those who travel - or would \ntravel - on the spiritual pilgrimage from the City of Destruction to \nthe Celestial City.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps because so many readers experienced the same sort of \npilgrimage in their lives, The Pilgrim's Progress, became the world's \nbest-selling devotional book. Bunyan describes the most intimate \nstates of the Christian soul. His realization of the depth of God's \ngrace in his own life gave Bunyan an ability to speak to many people, \neven generations, of their own spiritual state. Bunyan's other \nworks,Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, The Life and Death of \nMr. Badman, and The Holy War, never achieved the popularity ofThe \nPilgrim's Progress. This one humbly written work touched thousands of \nlive sand became a classic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's book Dates With Destiny by \nCurtis, Lang and Petersen.

    "title": "BLAISE PASCAL'S CONVERSION",
    "words": "November 23, 1654 \u0014\nBlaise Pascal's conversion\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever we see a genius who has many talents--Leonardo da Vinci, \nThomas Jefferson, or Benjamin Franklin, for instance,--we call that \nperson a Renaissance man. Blaise Pascal of France was a Renaissance \nman. He was a prominent mathematician, physicist, inventor, and \nChristian writer. He made important contributions to geometry, \ncalculus, and helped develop the theory of probability. Pascal's law \nis the basis for hydraulic operations. At l9, he invented the world's \nfirst mechanical calculator. The computer language known as PASCAL \nwas named after him.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal grew up accepting the Bible as God's word, but in a rather \nabstract way. He looked into Jansenism, a Catholic reform movement \nthat emphasized the Augustinian (and Calvinist) concept of grace. \nNonetheless, he lived with a sense of spiritual desperation. \nDisgusted with himself he once wrote: \"If one does not know himself \nto be full of pride, ambition, concupiscence, weakness, pettiness, \ninjustice, one is very blind. And if, knowing this, a man does not \ndesire to be delivered, what can one say to him?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, November 23, 1654, Pascal's horses bolted and plunged \noff a bridge. Pascal was thrown into the roadway. He saw this as a \nwarning directly from God. That night he experienced a Christian \nconversion that would cause his outstanding scientific work to take \nsecond place in his pursuits. Light flooded his room. He recognized \nJesus, the Word. For the rest of his life Pascal carried around a \npiece of parchment sewn into his coat--a parchment inscribed with \necstatic phrases:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers \nand scholars...Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy...'This is life eternal \nthat they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom \nyou have sent.' Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ...May I not fall from him \nforever...I will not forget your word. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that day forward, Blaise Pascal realized even more deeply that \nhe must live primarily for God. He started out by giving much more to \nthe poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal closely associated himself with the Jansenists, a group of \nCatholics that emphasized morality in all aspects of life. In 1657 \nPascal published his Provincial Letters which criticized the moral \nteaching of the Jesuits, the rationalism of Descartes, and \nMontaigne's skepticism; and which urged a return to Augustine's \ndoctrines of grace. Voltaire described the collection as \"the first \nwork of genius to appear in France,\" (meaning the first such in \nFrench colloquial literature); it continues to be recognized as such.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal also wrote that we come to know God's truth not only by \nreason, but even more through the heart by faith. It is through our \nheart that we come to know God and to love Him. It is by faith that \nwe can come to know Christ--and God alone gives us faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBell, Eric Temple.

    "title": "BONIFACE: SALVATION IF YOU SUBMIT TO POPE",
    "words": "November 18, 1302 \u0014\nBoniface: Salvation if You Submit to Pope\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Boniface VIII published a bull on this day, November 18, 1302, \ntitled Unam sanctam. It still generates deep controversy. The bull \ndenies salvation to any human being who does not submit to the Roman \nCatholic Church and its head, the pope. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"...There is one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, outside of which \nthere is neither salvation nor remission of sins...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...Indeed we declare, say, pronounce, and define that it is \naltogether necessary to salvation for every human creature to be \nsubject to the Roman Pontiff.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA bull is a solemn papal letter. The form was given this name because \nit was sealed with a bulla, a round lead seal. This particular bull \nwas written as the latest round in an ongoing war of words between \nthe pope and King Philip IV \"the Fair\" of France.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope had denounced the sins of Philip as a bad example to the \nnation he ruled. Boniface called a council of bishops to consider \nreform of the French church. Philip refused to allow French bishops \nto attend. Philip said that the pope claimed feudal lordship over of \nFrance. Boniface denied this but acknowledged that he was prepared to \ndepose the French king just as earlier popes had deposed other French \nkings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe date of the council came and Philip still refused to allow his \nbishops to attend. Pope Boniface VIII then published Unam sanctam.\u0014\n\u0014\nApologists for the Roman Church now say that it applied only to \nCatholics, who were all under the jurisdiction of the Roman church. \nProtestantism had not yet appeared on the scene, they note. And only \nthe last line, they insist, provides a new statement of \ndoctrine--saying there is salvation only for those who submit to the \npope.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants find that last line the most troubling, of course. They \ncan agree that salvation is possible only in the church, because they \ndefine the true church as everyone who loves Christ and lives in him. \nThey can accept Unam sanctam's lines about the Greeks, because Greek \nbishops can demonstrate succession back to the apostles. What they \ncannot agree upon is that all must submit to the pope.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnam sanctam also seems to disagree with decisions of Vatican II, \nwhich acknowledge that some Protestants--and even some pagans--will \nbe saved. According to Vatican II, the divine design of salvation \nembraces all human beings; and those \"who without fault on their part \ndo not know the Gospel of Christ and His Church but seek God with a \nsincere heart, and under the influence of grace endeavor to do His \nwill as recognized through the prompting of their conscience,\" they \ntoo in a manner known only to God \"can obtain eternal salvation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoniface's bull raises controversy about the infallibility of the \npopes. Because it has implications for other doctrines of the Roman \nChurch, as well as on the possibility of ecumenical cooperation, a \ntrue interpretation of Unam sanctam remains important to scholars and \nChristians to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarry, William.

    "title": "BISHOPS RIDLEY AND LATIMER BURNED",
    "words": "October 16, 1555 \u0014\nBishops Ridley and Latimer Burned\u0014\n\u0014\nQueen Mary ascended the throne of England in 1553. In subsequent \nyears, she had at least two hundred people put to death (often by \nfire) for their religious convictions. To history she became known as \n\"Bloody Mary,\" although, in truth, she killed far fewer people per \nyear than her brutal father. It was the godliness of many of her \nvictims made them stand out.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary's father, King Henry VIII had separated the Church of England \nfrom the Roman Catholic church, but he had not reformed the church's \npractices or doctrines. On Henry's death, his young son Edward became \nKing. Many of Edward's advisors tried to move the English church in \nthe direction of a more Bible-based Christianity. Two such men were \nNicholas Ridley and Hugh Latimer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scholar Nicholas Ridley had been a chaplain to King Henry VIII \nand was Bishop of London under his son Edward. He was a preacher \nbeloved of his congregation whose very life portrayed the truths of \nthe Christian doctrines he taught. In his own household he had daily \nBible readings and encouraged Scripture memory among his people.\u0014\n\u0014\nHugh Latimer also became an influential preacher under King Edward's \nreign. He was an earnest student of the Bible, and as Bishop of \nWorcester he encouraged the Scriptures be known in English by the \npeople. His sermons emphasized that men should serve the Lord with a \ntrue heart and inward affection, not just with outward show. \nLatimer's personal life also re-enforced his preaching. He was \nrenowned for his works, especially his visitations to the prisons.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Mary became Queen of England, she worked to bring England back \nto the Roman Catholic Church. One of her first acts was to arrest \nBishop Ridley, Bishop Latimer, and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. After \nserving time in the Tower of London, the three were taken to Oxford \nin September of 1555 to be examined by the Lord's Commissioner in \nOxford's Divinity School.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ridley was asked if he believed the pope was heir to the \nauthority of Peter as the foundation of the Church, he replied that \nthe church was not built on any man but on the truth Peter confessed \n-- that Christ was the Son of God. Ridley said he could not honor the \npope in Rome since the papacy was seeking its own glory, not the \nglory of God. Neither Ridley nor Latimer could accept the Roman \nCatholic mass as a sacrifice of Christ. Latimer told the \ncommissioners, \"Christ made one oblation and sacrifice for the sins \nof the whole world, and that a perfect sacrifice; neither needeth \nthere to be, nor can there be, any other propitiatory sacrifice.\" \nThese opinions were deeply offensive to Roman Catholic theologians.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Ridley and Latimer were burned at the stake in Oxford on this \nday, October 16, 1555. As he was being tied to the stake, Ridley \nprayed, \"Oh, heavenly Father, I give unto thee most hearty thanks \nthat thou hast called me to be a professor of thee, even unto death. \nI beseech thee, Lord God, have mercy on this realm of England, and \ndeliver it from all her enemies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRidley's brother had brought some gunpowder for the men to place \naround their necks so death could come more quickly, but Ridley still \nsuffered greatly. With a loud voice Ridley cried, \"Into thy hands, O \nLord, I commend my spirit...\", but the wood was green and burned only \nRidley's lower parts without touching his upper body. He was heard to \nrepeatedly call out, \"Lord have mercy upon me! I cannot burn..Let the \nfire come unto me, I cannot burn.\" One of the bystanders finally \nbrought the flames to the top of the pyre to hasten Ridley's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nLatimer died much more quickly; as the flames quickly rose, Latimer \nencouraged Ridley, \"Be of good comfort, Mr. Ridley, and play the man! \nWe shall this day light such a candle by God's grace, in England, as \nI trust never shall be put out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe martyrdoms of Ridley, Latimer, and Thomas Cranmer are today \ncommemorated by a Martyrs' monument in Oxford. The faith they once \ndied for can now be freely practiced in the land.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Hugh. The Reformation.

    "words": "\u0014\nBy JEFFREY GETTLEMAN,  NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\nPublished: January 12, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nPIBOR, South Sudan  The trail of corpses begins about 300 yards from \nthe corrugated metal gate of the United Nations compound and \nstretches for miles into the bush. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is an old man on his back, a young woman with her legs splayed \nand skirt bunched up around her hips, and a whole family  man, \nwoman, two children  all facedown in the swamp grass, executed \ntogether. How many hundreds are scattered across the savannah, nobody \nreally knows. \u0014\n\u0014\nSouth Sudan, born six months ago in great jubilation, is plunging \ninto a vortex of violence. Bitter ethnic tensions that had largely \nbeen shelved for the sake of achieving independence have ruptured \ninto a cycle of massacre and revenge that neither the American-backed \ngovernment nor the United Nations has been able to stop. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States and other Western countries have invested billions \nof dollars in South Sudan, hoping it will overcome its deeply etched \nhistory of poverty, violence and ethnic fault lines to emerge as a \nstable, Western-friendly nation in a volatile region. Instead, \nheavily armed militias the size of small armies are now marching on \nvillages and towns with impunity, sometimes with blatantly genocidal \nintent. \u0014\nEight thousand fighters just besieged this small town in the middle \nof a vast expanse, razing huts, burning granaries, stealing tens of \nthousands of cows and methodically killing hundreds, possibly \nthousands, of men, women and children hiding in the bush. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe raiders had even broadcast their massacre plans. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe have decided to invade Murleland and wipe out the entire Murle \ntribe on the face of the earth, the attackers, from a rival ethnic \ngroup, the Nuer, warned in a public statement. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United Nations, which has 3,000 combat-ready peacekeepers in \nSouth Sudan, tracked the advancing fighters from helicopters for days \nbefore the massacre and rushed in about 400 soldiers. But the \npeacekeepers did not fire a single shot, saying they were greatly \noutnumbered and could have easily been massacred themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe attack was presaged by a fund-raising drive for the Nuer militia \nin the United States  a troubling sign that behind the raiders \ntoting Kalashnikovs and singing war songs was an active back office \nhalf a world away. Gai Bol Thong, a Nuer refugee in Seattle who \nhelped write the militias statement, said he had led an effort to \ncobble together about $45,000 from South Sudanese living abroad for \nthe warriors food and medicine. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe mean what we say, he said in an interview. We kill everybody. \nWe are tired of them. (He later scaled back and said he meant they \nwould kill Murle warriors, not civilians.) \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch ethnic clashes were unnervingly common here in 2009, before the \nfinal push for independence. More ominous than the small-scale cattle \nraids that have gone on for generations, the attacks often seemed \nlike infantry maneuvers, fueling accusations that northern Sudanese \nleaders had shipped in arms to destabilize the south. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut southerners seemed to rally together as the historic referendum \non independence from the north drew near. The exuberance brought \nreconciliation. Major ethnic clashes all but disappeared. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe respite was short lived. Fighting broke out almost immediately \nalong the border between north and south. Then, only a month after \nSouth Sudan celebrated its independence last July with a new national \nanthem and a countdown clock that blared Free at Last, Murle \nfighters killed more than 600 Nuer villagers and abducted scores of \nchildren. That attack set this months massacre into motion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe makeshift medical clinic here in Pibor now stinks of decaying \nflesh. It is full of Murle children with bullet holes drilled through \ntheir limbs. Many have trudged for days to get here, through swamps \nand murky rivers, and their wounds are suppurating and gangrenous. \nThe doctors take one look and whisper the word: amputation. \u0014\n\u0014\nSouth Sudans government has been extremely reluctant to wade into \nthese feuds, because the government itself is a loosely woven \ntapestry of rival ethnic groups that fought bitterly during Sudans \nlong civil war. The Nuer are a crucial piece of the governing \ncoalition, and the Lou Nuer, the subgroup that led the raid on Pibor, \nsupply thousands of soldiers to South Sudans army. \u0014\n\u0014\nNuer fighting Nuer? said a Western diplomat in South Sudan, \nconsidering the complications of a military intervention to stop the \nmassacre.

    "words": "January 16, 1756 \u0014\nBackus Bucked Formalism, Formed Baptist Church\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if you asked your pastor how you could be rescued from God's \nwrath and he said he didn't know? That is what happened to Isaac \nBackus. The Great Awakening was in full swing in America. Evangelists \nwakened Americans to realize they needed to repent of sin, and Isaac \nwas afraid.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen his pastor could not show him how to get right with God, Backus \nwent about his business. For weeks he prayed desperately that God \nwould show him how to save his soul. He felt powerless and very \nfrightened. Peace came one morning as he mowed a field. \"I was \nenabled by divine light to see the perfect righteousness of Christ \nand the freeness and riches of his grace,\" he later wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus was determined that no one else should suffer as he had by not \nknowing how to find salvation. He studied Scripture so that he could \nexplain to others that Jesus took our sin to the cross with him and \nthat forgiveness is ours if we confess our sins to God, believing he \nis able to restore us.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople noticed the young man's zeal. Backus was about 22 when he \nbegan to preach and 24 when a little \"separate\" church in \nMiddelborough, Massachusetts asked him to be their pastor. Separates \nwere those who were converted in the Great Awakening and left the \nestablished church thinking its ministers were cold fish who knew \ntheology but didn't know Jesus Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nAware of his great responsibility, young Backus pleaded earnestly \nwith the Lord that \"he wouldn't suffer me to settle down in any snare \nor evil way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus would have stayed with the Separates, but when he changed his \nviews on baptism, his congregation grew cold toward him. And so, on \nthis day, January 16, 1756, he formed the first Baptist church in \nMiddleborough. It is as a Baptist that Backus is famous. When he was \nborn, there were only 1,500 Baptists in New England. When he died, \nthere were 21,000-- many of them converted through his efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackus is most famous for his long battle against taxation to \nsupported state churches. It is wrong to force a person against their \nconscience, he said. \"In Christ's kingdom, each one has equal right \nto judge for himself.\" His recorded the testimony of hundreds who \nsuffered harassment because they refused to pay the religious tax. \nThese included several members of Backus's own family, who went to \njail or lost their property. Once he himself was seized by a \npoliceman, but someone paid the tax for him. Through letters, \ntestimony and civil disobedience, Backus forced Massachusetts to face \nits religious problem. He made others aware of the situation, too, \nriding 1,200 miles a year on horseback to inform them about it. He \nprinted pamphlets.

    "words": "January 26, 1800 \u0014\nBold Oncken, Begetter of European Baptists\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder God's direction a man can accomplish immense things. John \nGerhard Oncken demonstrated that.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was born in Varel, Germany on this day, January 26, 1800. At \nfourteen, he sailed on a Scottish ship to England, where he was \nconverted to Christianity. John joined a Congregational church. He \nthought of his homeland and its need for a more convincing religion. \nMany of Germany's state Lutheran churches were stagnant. When the \nContinental Society was formed to bring evangelical faith to Europe, \nOncken volunteered as a missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1823, he began work in Bremen and Hamburg. The established church \nwas furious at his success and tried to squash his work, but God \ncannot be defeated. Oncken persisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudying the scripture, he became convinced that only adult believers \nshould be baptized. At that time, he was unacquainted with Baptist \ndoctrine. He asked that someone be sent from England or Scotland to \nbaptize him and a handful of like-minded believers. He had to wait \nfive years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In 1834 a little company of seven believers were rowed across our \nbeautiful Elbe, in the dead hour of night, to a little island, and \nthere descending into the waters, were buried with Christ in baptism. \n. . The next day we were formed into a church, of which I was \nappointed the pastor.\" Germany's first modern-day Baptist church was \nborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists were despised by most Germans. You would understand why if \nyou could travel in a time machine back to sixteenth-century Munster. \nThe city fell into the hands of a so-called Anabaptist group who \nacted on wild prophecies. They taught a fighting brand of \nChristianity that allowed polygamy and communism. Lutherans and \nCatholics alike were scandalized by these \"Anabaptists\" and stamped \nthem out. Ordinary Germans thought the Baptists were a new form of \nthe Munster radicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of his country's bad memories, John Oncken and two other \nhelpers (one a converted Jew) led the Baptists to success after \nsuccess. Their numbers grew at a prodigious rate. The opposition and \nharassment of the state church could not hold them back. Oncken was \nthrown into prison. Everything he owned was taken to pay fines. Other \nBaptists were treated just as badly. Even protests by England and the \nUnited States could not stop the persecution. Still the church grew. \nIt sent missionaries to Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Hungary, \nPoland, Russia, and Switzerland. As in Germany, the Russian churches \nproved indestructible.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists in all these nations look back to one man as their \nforefather: John Oncken.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "words": "October 9, 1664 \u0014\nBenjamin Keach Testified\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin Keach appeared before Lord Chief Justice Hyde on this day, \nOctober 9, 1664. A Baptist minister, Benjamin's crime was to publish \na book of instruction for children; its doctrine did not conform to \nthe teachings of the Church of England. Although not a single copy \nexists today, from Benjamin's forty other publications, it is safe to \nconjecture that he disagreed with the established church over infant \nbaptism. He believed that only adults who understood what they were \ndoing should be baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge sought grounds to impose a sentence of death on his victim, \nbut could not find any. When the jury found Benjamin guilty only of \nmisquoting a single verse of Scripture, Hyde bullied the jurors into \nfinding the defendant guilty of other charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs soon as the guilty verdict was reached, the judge declared, \n\"Benjamin Keach, you are here convicted for writing, printing, and \npublishing a seditious and schismatical book, for which the court's \njudgment is that you go to jail for a fortnight without bail, and the \nnext Saturday stand upon the pillory at Aylesbury in the open market \nfor the space of two hours, with a paper upon your head with this \ninscription, 'For writing, printing, and publishing a schismatical \nbook entitled The Child's Instructor, or a New and Easy Primer,' and \nthe next Thursday to stand in the same manner and for the same time \nin the market of Winslow; and then your book shall be openly burnt \nbefore your face by the common hangman in disgrace of you and your \ndoctrine. And you shall forfeit to the king's majesty the sum of \ntwenty pounds; and shall remain in jail until you find sureties for \nyour good behavior and appearance at the next assizes, there to \nrenounce your doctrines and make such public submission as shall be \nenjoined upon you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin stood in the pillory in both towns. Usually a person in this \ndevice could expect to be jeered at and pelted with stones. But so \ngreatly did the onlookers respect Benjamin's holy life that they were \nkind to him. They listened as he defended his Baptist views. He was \nso convincing that the sheriff threatened to gag him. When a Church \nof England minister raised his voice against Benjamin, it was the \nChurch of England man that the crowd reproached for his godless life.\u0014\n\u0014\nPunishment did not stop Benjamin from preaching. Neither did other \narrests. He was fined several times. Once a troop of horsemen seized \nand bound him. They were about to trample him to death under their \nhorses when an officer stepped in and saved his life. He was taken to \nprison where he suffered many things.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike his contemporary John Bunyan, Benjamin was a great writer. His \nbooks and pamphlets sold well. In them, he championed baptism, \neducation for children and the use of hymns in worship. He also \npleaded with his readers to make sure that they really were \nChristians.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of his tracts he wrote \"What can render the state of a person \nworse than to be an enemy of God, Jesus Christ, and the power of \ngodliness; and yet to think he is holy and a good Christian?\" He went \non to explain the difference between reformation (outward change) and \nregeneration (heart change). One of the proofs of regeneration that \nhe listed is to hate sin so much that one would be willing to lose \neverything or undergo the greatest possible suffering rather than sin \nagainst God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin's church grew so rapidly that it had to be enlarged several \ntimes. Eventually, he pastored the church that became Charles \nSpurgeon's. In his autobiography, Spurgeon included a short account \nof Benjamin's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "title": "BEZA, LAST OF THE GREAT REFORMERS",
    "words": "October 13, 1605 \u0014\nBeza, Last of the Great Reformers\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nEach day, two of Geneva's ministers came to check on Theodore Beza. \nThe old reformer was dearly loved and they were concerned for his \nfailing health. On this day, Sunday, October 13, 1605, the sick man \nfelt well enough to dress. Theodore asked his visitors, \"Is the city \nin full safety and quiet?\" He was assured that all was well. Moments \nlater, he lost all strength and collapsed to the floor. Friends \ngathered and prayed at his bedside as he passed peacefully away \nwithin a few minutes. The last of the great reformers was dead. His \nhad been a life of much sorrow, hard work and grueling adventure.\u0014\nTheodore Beza was born in Burgundy in 1519, the son of a county \nbailiff. His father had marked out one course for him, but it seemed \nGod had another. At nine years of age he was sent to study with a \nfamous Greek scholar Melchior Wolmar. Wolmar's sympathy with the \nLutherans rubbed off on his pupil. What fruit this would bear was not \nyet apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeza's father wanted him to become a lawyer and Beza did the \npreliminary studies. However, he preferred literary studies and \nconvinced his father to allow him to switch fields. He became honored \nas a Latin poet and wit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough family connections, he received church benefices to live on. \nMeanwhile, like many clergymen of the day, he contracted a secret \nmarriage. His wife was Claudine Denosse. Then Beza fell dangerously \nill. As he lay in bed, he realized that he was a hypocrite, taking \nmoney from the Roman Church while secretly married and at heart a \nProtestant. As soon as he recovered sufficiently to do so, he fled \nfrom France with his wife, leaving behind fame and fortune.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse starts aren't all bad. His wit remained with him throughout his \nlife. Appealing to the king of Navarre, he once said, \"Sire, it is in \ntruth the lot of the Church of God, in whose name I am speaking, to \nendure blows, and not to strike them. But also may it please you to \nremember that it is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClaudine was one of the deepest joys of his life. Their marriage \nlasted until her death forty years later. Theodore himself became a \nleading Huguenot theologian, and eventually Calvin's successor as \nleader of the Swiss Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his long life he risked dangerous journeys again and again \ninto Catholic France, even traveling by night to escape detection. On \nthese trips he was in danger from Judas friends. Yet he argued the \nProtestant case before great theologians and political leaders. On \noccasion he accompanied Huguenot armies and preached for them. Using \nthe diplomatic skills honed during his upbringing, he visited the \nProtestant courts of Europe to win support for the suffering French \nProtestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notice of his death read, \"What the haven is to those that sail, \nthat is the removal into another life to those whose death is \nprecious in the eyes of the Lord.\" All were \"invited, in the name of \nthe pastors and professors, today at noon, to pay this last honor due \nto so great a man and one that has died in so pious a manner and \nattend his funeral...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaird, Henry Martyn.

    "title": "BAPTIST MISSISONARY SOCIETY FORMED IN ENGLAND",
    "words": "October 2, 1792 \u0014\nBaptist Missionary Society Formed in England\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gathering of young men who met in Mrs. Beeby Wallis' parlor on \nthis day, October 2, 1792 was not a likely group to begin major \nworld-wide missionary work. The twelve ministers were all from small \nchurches in the district of Kettering, England. Two had churches with \ncongregations of less than 25 each. But they had become increasingly \nconvinced that their churches should send the gospel message to the \nfar-flung corners of the globe. Surprisingly, many Christians in the \neighteenth century accepted the argument that the heathen had \nrejected the gospel and would be held accountable for their rejection \non the coming day of judgment. Some even argued that if God wanted \nthe heathen saved, he would enlighten them without any human help.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young pastor William Carey couldn't accept such views. He said \nthe Apostles were commanded to teach all nations; and since the \npromise of the gospel was still true, surely the command to teach the \nnations was still true as well. Carey set down on paper his thoughts \non the state of the world in his day, the need for missions, and the \nmethods which should be used in carrying out the task. In May 1792 he \npublished these as An Enquiry into the Obligation of Christians to \nuse Means for the Conversion of the Heathens.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoint by point Carey answered objections which had been put forward \nagainst missionary activity. Were heathen lands too distant? \nNavigation had improved greatly in the last centuries. Were the \nheathen ways barbarous? Merchants and traders didn't seem to mind the \ninconvenience of dealing with them. Was there physical danger to \nmissionary activity or difficulties in procuring supplies or language \nbarriers? If these all could be overcome in the interest of commerce \nand profit, surely they could be overcome for the Kingdom of Christ. \nCarey encouraged his readers to \"Expect great things from God; \nAttempt great things for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCarey's pamphlet and impassioned address on missions at the \nsemi-annual minister's meeting at Kettering stirred the young men to \naction. When they met on October 2 in Mrs. Wallis' parlor, they \nformed the Baptist Missionary Society for spreading the gospel among \nthe heathen. Andrew Fuller was appointed Secretary, and a small snuff \nbox with a picture of St. Paul's conversion on the lid became the \ntreasury. Each minister wrote down what he thought he could give, and \n13 20s 6d was promised. It was very little for such a grand purpose, \nbut hadn't the Lord done much with a boy's five loaves and two fishes?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next year the society sent out William Carey to India. Carey \ntranslated the New Testament into Bengali; his influence alone \nextended throughout much of the East, to Burma, the East Indies, and \nChina.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Baptist Missionary Society was the first foreign missionary \nsociety created by the Evangelical Revival of the last half of the \neighteenth century. In short order other missionary societies were \nestablished, and a new era in missions began as the faith was \nincreasingly spread outside of the West, to the regions of Africa and \nAsia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe work which began in Mrs. Wallis' parlor continues today. Two \nhundred years later the Baptist Missionary Society still works in \nIndia in cooperation with the native church. There are 33 mission \nstations in the Indian sub-continent under its auspices with numerous \nchurches, schools, hospitals, clinics, and agricultural programs. In \n1981 the society had a total of 191 foreign missionaries throughout \nAsia and Africa.

    "words": "September 15, 1963 \u0014\nBirmingham Blast: Why Children?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was this day, Sunday, September 15, 1963. The place was 16th \nStreet Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. The lesson for the day \nwas, \"The Love that Forgives,\" based on Matthew 5:43, 44. \"You have \nheard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But \nI tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\" \nA prayer was to accompany the lesson: \"Dear God, we are sorry for the \ntimes we were unkind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lesson would prove to be grimly appropriate. But it was never \nfinished. At 9:22 A.M., before it could be completed, the church \nexploded.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen or fifteen sticks of dynamite planted under the back steps of the \nbuilding erupted with terrific force. The explosion hurled yellow \nbricks through cars, shattered nearby businesses and smashed a fist \nof terror through the church. The rest rooms at the rear of the \nchurch absorbed the brunt of the blast. Nonetheless, the shock was \nsufficient to collapse the church rafters, shred pews and shatter \nwindows. Members of this black congregation--wounded, bleeding, and \nblinded,--staggered into the street as rescue crews rushed to the \nscene. In place of hymns, screams and sobs and cries of protest \nfilled the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn angry mob of blacks gathered. Black ministers called on them to \npray for the men who had perpetrated this outrage. \"We must have love \nin our hearts for these men.\" But the anguish and bitterness of the \nmoment spoke louder. The mob began to pelt rescue workers and police \nwith stones as they dug into the rubble. Police fired over the head \nof the crowd to disperse them. Once again hatred prevailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBirmingham was no stranger to bombings. Since World War II, fifty had \nbeen directed against blacks. But none of the previous bombers had \nstruck against churches. Or targeted children.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, children were missing. Fears turned to stark reality as the \nwreckage was peeled aside from what had been the rest room. One man \nuncovered the remains of his own granddaughter. Torn and mangled \nbodies came to light: little bodies, the bodies of four girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley \ndied. Seventeen other people were wounded. The death toll could have \nbeen much higher. Four hundred people were in the church at the time. \nChrist could only have grieved. He taught us to love our neighbor as \nourselves, and yet the very churches built in his name were \nsegregated and subject to mindless violence as men battled for \npolitical control of a race-crazed city. One reporter noted that \nChrist's head in a stained glass window was blown off.\u0014\n\u0014\nKlansman Robert Chambliss was convicted of his part in the crime \nfourteen years after the blast. Two other conspirators, Tommy Blanton \nand Bobby Cherry were finally brought to justice in 2001 and 2002 \nrespectively.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nNews reports in Time, Newsweek and other news sources.\u0014\nSikora, Frank.

After graduating from Oxford University (where he also \ntutored), he went to work for the British Museum in 1889. Nine years \nlater he had become assistant keeper of manuscripts. By 1909 he was \nits director and head librarian. A renowned scholar of ancient \nlanguages, he also took a deep interest in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis position offered him many opportunities to study ancient papyri \nin the Greek language. Papyri are documents written on Egyptian reed \n\"paper.\" He showed that there are parallels between things written in \nthe Greek documents and the text of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars as great as Frederick often write in such a way that few \npeople can follow what they say. But Frederick had a gift for making \nhis words understandable to ordinary people. He wrote books such as \nOur Bible and the Ancient Manuscripts. He was convinced that science \ndoes not disprove the Bible, but rather supports it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting about the Bible, he showed that our documentary evidence for \nit is very good compared to the documentary evidence for other events \nin ancient history. For instance, here is what he has to say about \nSophocles: \"We believe that we have in all essentials an accurate \ntext of the seven extant plays [plays for which we still have copies] \nof Sophocles; yet the earliest substantial manuscript upon which it \nis based was written more than 1,400 years after the poet's death.\" \nBy comparison, the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament date to \nless than 100 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus and \nalmost every verse of the New Testament had been quoted in a writing \nby someone somewhere by the third century. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The number of manuscripts of the New Testament, or early \ntranslations from it in the oldest writers of the Church, is so large \nthat it is practically certain that the true reading of every \ndoubtful passage is preserved in some one or other of these ancient \nauthorities. This can be said of no other ancient book in the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick concluded from his researches that, \"The Christian can take \nthe whole Bible in his hand and say without fear or hesitation that \nhe holds in it the true Word of God, handed down without essential \nloss from generation to generation, throughout the centuries.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1920, Sir Frederick became president of the British School of \nArchaeology in Jerusalem. He had been knighted in 1912. Between 1933 \nand 1936, Frederick published the famous Chester Beatty papyri in \nfive volumes. The British museum had acquired these. They dated from \nabout 200 AD and included most of the Epistles of Paul.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick was not only interested in the Bible, but in the era of \nAristotle and the poetry of Robert Browning. The great scholar died \non this day, August 23, 1952. He was 89 years old, but had lived long \nenough to learn of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis daughter Kathleen also became an archaeologist and began \nexcavating Jericho the year her father died. She came to conclusions \nthat differed from her dad's. Today, Frederick's conclusions are \nseldom mentioned outside Christian circles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Kathleen Mary Kenyon.\" http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/ \nbiography/klmno/kenyon_kathleen.html\u0014\nKenyon, Frederic G.

    "words": "January 30, 1750 \u0014\nBoston Preacher Mayhew Ignited Revolution\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we witness the power of Islamic clergymen to sway masses of \nfaithful Muslims, it reminds us of the impact religious ideas have \nhad in our own history. Pope Urban preached a rousing sermon and \nlaunched the first crusade. John Knox urged discouraged Scottish \nrebels not to rely on their own arms but on God and the Scottish \nreformers took new heart. From his Boston pulpit, Jonathan Mayhew \ncalled for the repeal of the stamp act and the stamp riots followed. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever one thinks of Jonathan Mayhew's theology--it was so liberal \nthat the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers would not \nadmit him--no one can deny his influence on the American Revolution. \nNot only did he preach the sermon that led to the stamp riots, but he \npreached another which John Adams called \"the spark that ignited the \nAmerican Revolution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was on this day, January 30, 1750 that Jonathan Mayhew preached \nhis Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-resistance to \nthe Higher Powers. In it he took to task those who used some words by \nPaul in the New Testament to argue that the colonists must obey King \nGeorge III whether he was right or wrong. Paul had written that we \nare to obey authorities. They are instituted by God, serve God, and \nexist to do us good. We should obey not just for fear of punishment \nbut for conscience's sake. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Here the apostle argues, that those who resist a reasonable and just \nauthority, which is agreeable to the will of God, do really resist \nthe will of God himself; and will, therefore, be punished by him,\" \nsaid Mayhew. \"But how does this prove, that those who resist a \nlawless, unreasonable power, which is contrary to the will of God, do \ntherein resist the will and ordinance of God? Is resisting those who \nresist God's will, the same thing with resisting God?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Common tyrants, and public oppressors, are not intitled to obedience \nfrom their subjects, by virtue of any thing here laid down by the \ninspired apostle.\" To illustrate his point Mayhew raises a similar \ncase. \"Suppose God requires a family of children, to obey their \nfather and not to resist him...Suppose this parent at length runs \ndistracted, and attempts, in his mad fit, to cut all his children's \nthroats: Now, in this case, is not the reason before assigned, why \nthese children should obey their parent while he continued of a sound \nmind, namely, their common good, a reason equally conclusive for \ndisobeying and resisting him, since he is become delirious, and \nattempts their ruin?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMayhew's lengthy, carefully reasoned sermon was printed and widely \nread in the colonies. Many Americans accepted its arguments. Among \nthem were John Adams, James Otis, and Josiah Quincey, leaders of the \nrevolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n\"V.

    "words": "Bishops Play Church Queens as Pawns\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MAUREEN DOWD   4/28/12  New York Times\u0014\nWASHINGTON \u0014\n\u0014\nIT is an astonishing thing that historians will look back and puzzle \nover, that in the 21st century, American women were such hunted \ncreatures. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven as Republicans try to wrestle women into chastity belts, the \nVatican is trying to muzzle American nuns. \u0014\n\u0014\nWho thinks its cool to bully nuns? While continuing to heal and \neducate, the community of sisters is aging and dying out because few \nyounger women are willing to make such sacrifices for a church \ndetermined to bring women to heel. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet the nuns must be yanked into line by the crepuscular, medieval \nmen who run the Catholic Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts not terribly unlike the days of yore when they singled out \npeople in the rough days of the Inquisition, said Kenneth Briggs, \nthe author of Double Crossed: Uncovering the Catholic Churchs \nBetrayal of American Nuns. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow can the church hierarchy be more offended by the nuns \nimpassioned advocacy for the poor than by priests sordid pedophilia? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you take spiritual direction from a church that seems to be \nlosing its soul? \u0014\n\u0014\nIt has become a habit for the church to go after women. A Worcester, \nMass., bishop successfully fought to get a commencement speech \ninvitation taken away from Vicki Kennedy, widow of Teddy Kennedy, \nbecause of her positions on some social issues. And an Indiana woman \nnamed Emily Herx has filed a lawsuit saying she was fired from her \njob teaching in a Catholic school and denounced as a grave, immoral \nsinner by the parish pastor after she used fertility treatments to \ntry to get pregnant with her husband. \u0014\n\u0014\nCardinal Timothy Dolan of New York recently told The Wall Street \nJournal that only a tiny minority of priests were tainted by the \nsex abuse scandal. But its a global shame spiral. The church \nleadership never recoiled in horror from pedophilia, yet it recoils \nin horror from outspoken nuns. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Philadelphia, Msgr. William Lynn, 61, is the first church \nsupervisor to go on trial for child endangerment. He is fighting \ncharges that he may have covered up for 20 priests accused of sexual \nabuse and left in the ministry, often transferred to unwitting \nparishes. \u0014\n\u0014\nSomehow the Philadelphia church leaders decided that the Rev. Thomas \nSmith was not sexually motivated when he made boys strip and be \nwhipped playing Christ in a Passion play. Somehow they decided an \naltar boy who said he was raped by two priests and his fifth-grade \nteacher was not the one in need of protection. \u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of looking deep into its own heart and soul, the church is \ngoing after the women who are the heart and soul of parishes, schools \nand hospitals. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe stunned sisters are debating how to respond after the Vaticans \nscorching reprimand to the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, \nthe main association of American Catholic nuns. The bishops were \nobviously peeved that some nuns had the temerity to speak out in \nsupport of President Obamas health care plan, including his \ncompromise on contraception for religious hospitals. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Vatican accused the nuns of pushing radical feminist themes, \nand said they were not vocal enough in parroting church policy \nagainst the ordination of women as priests and against abortion, \ncontraception and homosexual relationships. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a blatant Shut up and sit down, sisters moment, the Vaticans \ndoctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, \nnoted, Occasional public statements by the L.C.W.R. that disagree \nwith or challenge positions taken by the bishops, who are the \nchurchs authentic teachers of faith and morals, are not compatible \nwith its purpose. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Benedict, who became known as Gods Rottweiler when he was the \ncardinal conducting the offices loyalty tests, assigned Archbishop \nJ. Peter Sartain of Seattle to crack down on the climate of \ncorporate dissent among the poor nuns. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the nuns push for social justice, theyre put into stocks. Yet \nArchbishop Sartain has led a campaign in Washington to reverse the \nstates newly enacted law allowing same-sex marriage, and hes a \nchurch hero. \u0014\n\u0014\nSister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network, a Catholic \nlobbying group slapped in the Vatican report, said it scares the \nchurch hierarchy to have educated women form thoughtful opinions and \nengage in dialogue. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe told NPR that it was ironic that church leaders were mad at \nsisters over contraception when the nuns had committed to a celibate \nlife with no families or babies. Given the damage done by the \npedophilia scandals, she said, the churchs obsession, at times, \nwith the sexual relationships is a serious problem. \u0014\n\u0014\nAsked by The Journal if the church had a hard time convincing the \nflock to follow its strict teachings on sexuality, Cardinal Dolan \nlaughed: Do we ever! \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders behave like adolescent boys, blinded by sex. Thats \nthe problem with inquisitors and censors: They become fascinated by \nwhat they deplore. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope needs what the rest of us got from nuns: a good rap across \nthe knuckles.\u0014",

    "words": "Bullies on the Bus\u0014\nBy CHARLES M. BLOW\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: June 22, 2012  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMaking the Bus Monitor Cry. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThats the name of the video. Its more than 10 minutes long, but if \nyou make it through more than three of them with your eyes not \ngetting misty and your blood not boiling then you are a rock, or at \nleast your heart is. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe video shows Karen Klein, a 68-year-old grandmother and bus \nmonitor in upstate New York, being relentlessly tormented by a group \nof young boys. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey hurl profanities. One asks for her address because he says he \nwants to go urinate on her door. Others are more explicit about \ndefiling her. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne boy tells her that she doesnt have a family because they all \nkilled themselves because they didnt want to be near you. (Her \neldest son committed suicide.) \u0014\n\u0014\nOne suggests that if he were to stab her, his knife would go through \nher like butter. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince the video was posted to YouTube, there has been an outpouring \nof shock and outrage. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn online campaign set up to raise $5,000 to send Klein on a vacation \nhad raised more than $500,000 by midday Friday, Klein has made the \nmedia circuit recounting her ordeal and some of the children have \napologized. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut what, if anything, does this say about society at large? Many \nthings one could argue, but, for me, it is a remarkably apt metaphor \nfor this moment in the American discourse in which hostility has been \ndrawn out into the sunlight. \u0014\n\u0014\nThose boys are us, or at least too many of us: America at its \nugliest. It is that part of society that sees the weak and vulnerable \nas worthy of derision and animus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of behavior is not isolated to children and school buses \nand suburban communities. It stretches to the upper reaches of \nsociety  our politics and our pulpits and our public squares. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhether it is a Republican debate audience booing a gay soldier or \nRush Limbaughs vicious attack on a female Georgetown law student or \nNewt Gingrichs salvos at the poor, bullying has become boilerplate. \nHiss and taunt. Tease and intimidate. Target your enemies and torture \nthem mercilessly. Maintain primacy through predation. \u0014\n\u0014\nTraditionally inferior identity roles are registered in a variety of \nways. For Klein, she was elderly and female and not thin or rich. For \nothers, it is skin color, country of origin, object of affection or \nsome other accident of birth. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe country is changing, and that change is creating friction: \nbetween the traditional ruling classes and emerging ones; between \ntraditional social structures and altered ones; between a long-held \nvision of an American ideal and growing reality that its time has \npassed. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that change is coming with an unrelenting swiftness. \u0014\n\u0014\nLast month, the Census Bureau reported that for the first time in the \ncountrys history, minority births outnumbered those of whites. And \nThe New York Times recently highlighted a Brookings Institution \ndemographers calculations that, minorities accounted for 92 percent \nof the nations population growth in the decade that ended in 2010. \u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, there are now more women in college than men, and a Pew \nResearch Center poll published in April found that, in a reversal of \ntraditional gender roles, young women now surpass young men in the \nimportance they place on having a high-paying career or profession. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Gallup poll released Thursday found that a record number of people \n(54 percent) say that they would be willing to vote for an atheist \nfor president, and a Gallup poll last month found that more people \nsupport same-sex marriage than oppose it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese dramatic shifts are upending the majority-minority paradigm and \nare making many people uneasy. \u0014\nThe Republican-Democratic divide is increasingly becoming an \nall-white/multicultural divide, a male/female divide, and a more \nreligious/less religious divide  the formers the traditional power \nclasses, and the latters the emerging ones. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis has led to some increasingly unseemly attacks at traditionally \nmarginalized groups, even as  and possibly particularly because  \nthey grow more powerful. \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are under attack. Hispanics are under attack. Minority voting \nrights are under attack. The poor are under attack. Unsurprisingly, \nthose doing the attacking in every case are from the right. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeldom is power freely passed and painlessly surrendered, \nparticularly when the traditionally powerful see the realignment as \nan existential threat. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe bullying on that bus was awful, but so is the bullying in our \npolitics. Those boys were trying to exert power over a person placed \nthere to rein them in. But bullying is always about power  \nprojecting more than you have in order to accrue more than your \nshare. \u0014\n\u0014\nSounds like the frightened, insecure part of American society.\u0014",

    "words": "Baptism of Indian Warrior Geronimo\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nLate one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few \nwomen and children who told us that Mexican troops from some other \ntown had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, \ncaptured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, \nand killed many of our women and children...when all were counted, I \nfound that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children \nwere among the slain. There were no lights in camp, so without being \nnoticed I silently turned away and stood by the river. How long I \nstood there I do not know, but when I saw the warriors arranging for \na council I took my place...\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I had no weapon, nor did I hardly wish to fight, neither did I \ncontemplate recovering the bodies of my loved ones, for that was \nforbidden. I did not pray, nor did I resolve to do anything in \nparticular, for I had no purpose left...I was never again contented \nin our quiet home. True, I could visit my father's grave, but I had \nvowed vengeance upon the Mexican troopers who had wronged me, and \nwhenever I came near his grave or saw anything to remind me of former \nhappy days my heart would ache for revenge upon Mexico...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was the beginning of the violent career of Geronimo, one of the \nmost feared Indian fighters of the old West. His people decided to go \non the warpath and sent him to woo the support of other tribes, which \nhe did. About a year later, the Apache and their allies encountered \nthe Mexicans. They chose Geronimo to lead them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was no chief and never had been, but because I had been more \ndeeply wronged than others, this honor was conferred upon me, and I \nresolved to prove worthy of the trust. I arranged the Indians in a \nhollow circle near the river, and the Mexicans drew their infantry up \nin two lines, with the cavalry in reserve. We were in the timber, and \nthey advanced until within about four hundred yards, when they halted \nand opened fire. Soon I led a charge against them, at the same time \nsending some braves to attack the rear. In all the battle I thought \nof my murdered mother, wife, and babies--of my father's grave and my \nvow of vengeance, and I fought with fury. Many fell by my hand, and \nconstantly I led the advance. Many braves were killed...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGeronimo harassed the Southwest for many years, but was captured in \n1886. He escaped and renewed his raids. It took the U.S. army \neighteen months to nab him. He remained in military custody until his \ndeath in 1909, but was allowed to raise stock.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 1, 1903, the Apache fighter was baptized into the \nMethodist Church in Medicine Creek, Oklahoma Territory. \"Believing \nthat in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating \nwith Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the \nChristian religion...I am not ashamed to be a Christian...I have \nadvised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that \nreligion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to \nlive right.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWas he really born again into Christ by the Holy Spirit as Methodists \nteach? If so, Geronimo \"backslid,\" for he soon drifted back into \nalcoholism and out of church fellowship. However, he was not \ncompletely hardened. A sense of dissatisfaction with his course made \nhim ask later if he could be reunited with the church; and he was.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGeronimo.

    "words": "July 2, 862 \u0014\nBeloved Bishop St. Swithun\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPromise me one thing.\" On his bed, old bishop Swithun struggled to \nspeak.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What is it, Father?\" asked the men who stood around him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Promise me, when I die, that you will bury me outside the north wall \nwhere passers-by can pass over my grave and raindrops from the eaves \ncan drop upon it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLittle more is known about St. Swithun's personal likes and dislikes \nthan that. He may have been a Benedictine monk and the Prior of \nWinchester, but even that is not certain.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is known is that King Egbert of the West Saxons employed Swithun \nas one of his two principle advisors. Swithun is thought to have \ntaught the future king, Ethelwulf, father of Alfred the Great. Their \nsignatures and his are on an ancient parchment which gives the church \n1/10th of the lands of Wessex for its support. In 852, Ceolnoth, \nArchbishop of Canterbury, consecrated Swithun as bishop of \nWinchester. Probably the appointment was made at the King's request.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvidently Swithun won the affection of his folk among whom he labored \nfor the better part of a decade. He was famous for building bridges \nand churches. Patterning himself after Christ Jesus, he gave gifts to \nthe poor and needy. When he died on this day, July 2, 862, he was \nburied in a common grave outside of Old Winchester Cathedral as he \nhad requested. His body lay there for about a century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen it was moved into a church building. Supposedly it rained for \nmany days then (or the rain may have occurred at an earlier attempt \nto move his body). At any rate, a folk saying emerged, \u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Swithun's day if thou dost rain \u0014\nFor forty days it will remain \u0014\nSt. Swithun's day if thou be fair\u0014\nFor forty days 'twill rain no more. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Swithun's remains were transferred to the cathedral, many people \nclaimed miraculous cures. The common folk regarded this as proof he \nhad indeed been a saint. A typical Medieval cult grew up around him. \nSwithun's tomb became one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in \nEngland. Pieces of his body were borrowed for other shrines, his head \ngoing to Canterbury and an arm to Peterborough Abbey.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwithun's body was moved into yet another Winchester church in the \nfollowing century. It remained in this final home until the \nReformation. In 1538, English reformers destroyed Swithun's shrine \nand scattered its relics. They considered it idolatry to bow and pray \nat such shrines and unnecessary anyhow, because Christians are free \nto go directly to God through Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAelfric, Abbot of Eynsham.

    "words": "BUTTONS IN THE OFFERING PLATE\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Sunday morning in my first pastorate, I noticed the lead usher \nrummaging through the collection plate during the offering. He was \ntaking what looked like money out of the plate and was putting it in \nhis pocket.\u0014\n\u0014\nI caught up with him after the service. He laughed when he saw me \ncoming.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Don't worry,\" he said. \"I'm not embezzling the offering. One of the \nbus kids put some buttons in the offering plate. I was just taking \nthem out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe kids in question were youngsters we picked up each Sunday in a \ndecrepit school bus we bought from the county. These were poor kids \nwho lived in a rundown neighborhood not far from our church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut kids or not, the worship service was no time to be playing games. \nI took the buttons from the usher and headed for the bus. The \nchildren were laughing and making noise, but fell silent when they \nsaw me standing in the aisle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who put these buttons in the offering plate today?\" I asked, holding \nthe buttons in the palm of my hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nA tiny little girl with big green eyes, bigger now because of her \nfear, slowly raised her hand.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I did, Brother Jim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why did you do that?\" Apparently, she heard the disapproval in my \nvoice. Her big green eyes filled with tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith her voice breaking, she said, \"I didn't mean to do anything bad. \nI just wanted to make an offering to God, like you said we should. \nBut I don't have any money like the other people. So I asked my Momma \nwhat could I give and she gave me those buttons from her sewing box. \nShe said maybe somebody could use the buttons to help someone make \nsome clothes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe weight of my stupidity fell on me like a brick.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You didn't do anything wrong,\" I said, fighting back my own tears. \n\"I just wanted to thank you for your special offering. Thank your \nMomma, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose buttons in the offering plate have given me much to think about \nthrough the years. They have helped me understand how often we make \nthe same mistake with other kinds of offerings.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, in our culture, churches that are able to grow larger \nand larger every year are regarded as successful, vital churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmall congregations that bury as many members as they baptize are \nregarded as less vital. Sometimes they are called dying churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut is that true? Is the offering of worship and prayer in a small \nchurch any less important, any less valuable than the mega-church \ndown the road? Does a church only gain validity if it is growing?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd how about the ministers that serve those churches?

The man described how thousands of scorched, \ntwisted bodies writhed on the ground in the final throes of death, \nwhile those still on their feet wandered aimlessly in shockflesh \nseared, melted, and falling off. The crewmans description raised a \nstifled cry from the depths of Zabelkas soul: My God, what have we \ndone? Over the next twenty years, he gradually came to believe that \nhe had been terribly wrong, that he had denied the very foundations \nof his faith by lending moral and religious support to the bombing of \nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Zabelka died in 1992, but his message, in \nthis speech given on the 40th anniversary of the bombings, must never \nbe forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe destruction of civilians in war was always forbidden by the \nchurch, and if a soldier came to me and asked if he could put a \nbullet through a childs head, I would have told him, absolutely not. \nThat would be mortally sinful. But in 1945 Tinian Island was the \nlargest airfield in the world. Three planes a minute could take off \nfrom it around the clock. Many of these planes went to Japan with the \nexpress purpose of killing not one child or one civilian but of \nslaughtering hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of children \nand civiliansand I said nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nI never preached a single sermon against killing civilians to the men \nwho were doing it. I was brainwashed! It never entered my mind to \nprotest publicly the consequences of these massive air raids. I was \ntold it was necessarytold openly by the military and told implicitly \nby my churchs leadership. (To the best of my knowledge no American \ncardinals or bishops were opposing these mass air raids. Silence in \nsuch matters is a stamp of approval.)\u0014\n\u0014\nI worked with Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Civil Rights \nstruggle in Flint, Michigan. His example and his words of nonviolent \naction, choosing love instead of hate, truth instead of lies, and \nnonviolence instead of violence stirred me deeply. This brought me \nface to face with pacifismactive nonviolent resistance to evil. I \nrecall his words after he was jailed in Montgomery, and this blew my \nmind. He said, Blood may flow in the streets of Montgomery before we \ngain our freedom, but it must be our blood that flows, and not that \nof the white man. We must not harm a single hair on the head of our \nwhite brothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI struggled. I argued. But yes, there it was in the Sermon on the \nMount, very clear: Love your enemies. Return good for evil. I went \nthrough a crisis of faith. Either accept what Christ said, as \nunpassable and silly as it may seem, or deny him completely.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the last 1700 years the church has not only been making war \nrespectable: it has been inducing people to believe it is an \nhonorable profession, an honorable Christian profession.

    "title": "BAPTISM IN BECOMING A JEW",
    "words": "\"As many of you,\" says Paul, \"who have been baptized into Christ \nhave put on Christ.\" There are two vivid pictures here. Baptism was a \nJewish rite. If a man wished to accept the Jewish faith he had to do \nthree things. He had to be circumcised, to offer sacrifice and to be \nbaptized. Ceremonial washing to cleanse from defilement was very \ncommon in Jewish practice (compare Lev 11-15). \u0014\n\u0014\n     The details of Jewish baptism were as follows: The man to be \nbaptized cut his hair and his nails; he undressed completely; the \nbaptismal bath had to contain 40 seahs, that is 2 hogsheads, of \nwater. Every part of the body had to be touched with the water. He \nmade confession of his faith before three men who were called \nfatherly of baptism. While still in the water, parts of the law were \nread to him, words of encouragement were addressed to him, and \nbenedictions were pronounced upon him. When he emerged he was a \nmember of the Jewish faith; it was through baptism that he entered \ninto that faith. \u0014\n     By Christian baptism a man entered into Christ. The early \nChristians looked on baptism as something which produced a real union \nwith Christ. Of course, in a missionary situation where men were \ncoming direct from heathenism, baptism was for the most part adult \nbaptism and the adult would necessarily have an experience a child \ncould not have. But just as really as the Jewish convert was united \nwith the Jewish faith, the Christian convert was united with Christ \n(compare Rom 6:3ff.; Col 2:12). Baptism was no mere outward form; it \nwas a real union with Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Paul goes on to say that they had put on Christ. There may be \nhere a reference to a custom which certainly existed later. The \ncandidate for baptism was clothed in pure white robes, symbolic of \nthe new life into which he entered. Just as the initiate put on his \nnew white robe, his life was clothed with Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The result is that in the Church there was no difference between \nany of the members; they had all become sons of God. In Gal 3:28 Paul \nsays that the distinction between Jew and Greek, slave and free man, \nmale and female is wiped out. There is something of very great \ninterest here. In the [Orthodox] Jewish morning prayer, which Paul \nmust all his pre-Christian life have used, the Jew thanks God that \n\"Thou hast not made me a Gentile, a slave or a woman.\" Paul takes \nthat prayer and reverses it. The old distinctions were gone; all were \none in Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n     We have already seen (Gal 3:16) that Paul interprets the \npromises made to Abraham as specially finding their fulfilment in \nChrist; and, if we are one with Christ, we, too, inherit the \npromises--and this great privilege comes not by a legalistic keeping \nof the law, but by an act of faith in the free grace of God. \u0014\n     Only one thing can wipe out the ever sharpening distinctions and \nseparations between man and man; when all are debtors to God's grace \nand all are in Christ, only then will all be one. It is not the force \nof man but the love of God which alone can unite a disunited world. \u0014\n\u0014\nBarclay's Daily Study Bible (NT).\u0014",

    "title": "BIRTH CONTROL PILLS CAUSE EARLY ABORTION- A RADICAL VIEW",
    "words": "\"Birth Control\" Pills cause early Abortions    (CLEARLY A RADICAL \nVIEW OF BIRITH CONTROL)\u0014\n\u0014\nby J. T. Finn \u0014\nPhysicians across America -- and around the world -- are now \nconfirming that the Pill, IUDs, Depo-Provera, and \u0014\nNorplant cause early abortions. First, a look at the Pill. Research \nshows that in many cases the Pill causes early abortions -- abortions \nthe mother may not even know she's having. You may find this \nshocking, but the facts are clear. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy the big secret? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy aren't most women aware that the Pill causes early abortions? \nLet's look at the large pharmaceutical compa- \u0014\nnies who advertise, market, and sell the Pill. They make huge profits \nfrom the Pill -- and they'll continue to make megaprofits -- if women \nare convinced they're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and \ntaking the Pill everyday. But are they being honest with you? Have \nthey clearly explained that their products \u0014\ncause millions of early chemical abortions each year? Most women take \nthese \"contraceptives\" because they don't want to have a baby. But \nhow many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become \npregnant while using these \"contraceptives?\" Very few! And how many \nof these women know that\u0014\nif they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION, these \n\"contraceptives\" will almost always kill any son or daughter they've \nconceived?\u0014\n \u0014\nMost people don't know the real facts about how \"contraceptives\" \nwork. And because of this lack of knowledge, most women are not aware \nthat they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS, and conceiving \nchildren that are killed very early in the pregnancy. Wom- \u0014\nen using these \"contraceptives\" almost never perceive that they have \nbecome pregnant, or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby. \u0014\nWhat is Breakthrough Ovulation? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile using the Pill and other chemical \"birth control\" products, \nmany women's ovaries continue to release eggs. This is called \n\"Breakthrough Ovulation\" and it occurs in millions of women each \nyear. Once an egg has been released via ovulation, a woman can become \npregnant. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou can still conceive a child ... \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you're using \"birth control\" products and you have a breakthrough \novulation that releases an egg, sperm can then reach and fertilize \nyour egg. At that moment -- you would be pregnant! Fertilization \nmeans conception has taken place and you now have a brand new son or \u0014\ndaughter who is as complete genetically as he or she will ever be \nthroughout life. \u0014\n\u0014\nBetrayed! \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are taking these products to avoid pregnancy (and abortion), \nnow you know that the makers and promoters of \"birth control\" \nproducts have betrayed you and your children. It has been proven many \ntimes that these products do not completely stop ovulation and \nconcep- \u0014\ntion. In fact, depending upon the product you're using, you could be \nat risk of ending the life of a newly conceived son or daughter every \nmonth by birth control's chemical abortions. That is potentially 12 \nabortions each year, by you! \u0014\n\u0014\nThe real medical truth. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's very important to understand that when a sperm penetrates one of \nyour eggs, you have conceived a child. Again, this is called \nfertilization or conception, and from that point on, you have a brand \nnew, genetically complete son or daughter. Every conception is a very \nunique mo- ment. For example, at your own conception, 46 chromosomes \nwith 30,000 genes combined to determine all your physical \ncharacteristics; sex, facial features, body type, color of hair, \neyes, and skin. Even more amazing, intelligence and personality -- \nthe way you think and feel -- were already in place within your \ngenetic code. At the moment of conception, you were essentially and \nuniquely \"you.\" This is the same for every human being at the moment \nof conception. \u0014\n\u0014\nRemember, the pharmaceutical industry has a multi-billion dollar \nbusiness selling these abortifacients. Unfortunately, many of the \npeople who prescribe these products are not aware of their homicidal \nproperties. They may have a sincere desire to help women, but their \nlack of knowledge makes them uninformed accomplices to these early \nabortions. As recently as 25 \u0014\nyears ago, most doctors took the Hippocratic Oath. They pledged never \nto perform an abortion. Tragically, many working in the medical \nprofession today betray your trust by renouncing this ethic. Many \nknow the truth but do not inform you that \"birth control\" devices are \nabortifacients \u0014\nwhich cause abortions. Did you know abortion was defined in a Public \nHealth Service document published by the U.S. Department of Health, \nEducation and Welfare as follows: \"All the measures which impair the \nviability of the zygote anytime between the instant of fertilization \nand the completion of labor constitute, in the strict sense, \nprocedures for inducing abortion\" \u0014\n(source: Public Health Service Leaflet no. 1066, US Dept of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare, 1963, 27). This includes chemical abortions \nlike those caused by the Pill, Depo-Provera and Norplant. \u0014\nNow That You Know The Truth ... \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you have used these products, this is very sobering news. \nPharmaceutical companies and medical providers have made many parents \nunwitting accomplices to their own children's death by birth control \nabortion. The Pill and its \"cousins\" kill children earlier in their \nlife than surgical abortion. In America, chemical abortions are \nestimated to kill more than 7 million babies each year -- while \nsurgical abortions kill about 1.5 million babies each year. Which is \nworse? \u0014\nWhat will you do? \u0014\n\u0014\nScientists agree that a new human life begins at the moment of \nconception. If you believe this, then you know that abortion is wrong \nno matter how early in the pregnancy. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow that you know the facts, statistics show that if you continue \nusing abortifacient products, you will be aborting (killing) your own \nchildren each year. Do more research if you need to, but please stop \nusing abortifacient chemicals immediately.\u0014",

When some of the transcripts of \nthe Nixon presidency were publicly released in 2002, Dr. Graham was \nheard commenting about the stranglehold that Jews had on America. His \ncomments caused an uproar across the country. Dr. Graham was \ndevastated not by the revelation of the tape, but by his own \ndistasteful remarks made thirty years earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the June 28, 2002 Billy Graham Crusade in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dr. \nGraham was invited to visit with a local Jewish organization. Before \nall the pleasantries were exchanged and the Jewish leaders could \nproperly receive him, Dr. Graham said, \"I should be coming here on my \nhands and knees begging you for your forgiveness.\" -- Les T.

A 10-year-old boy told police that he figured \nthat if he killed his neo Nazi father, he might not get in trouble \nbecause that's what happened on a television program he had watched.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A bad father did something to his kids and the kid did the exact \nsame thing I did  he shot him,\" the boy said in a videotaped \ninterview with detectives, as reported by the Riverside \nPress-Enterprise. \"He told the truth and wasn't arrested and the cops \nbelieved him. He wasn't in trouble or anything. I thought maybe the \nexact same thing would happen to me,\" he said of the episode of \n\"Criminal Minds.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors played the video in court on Wednesday, the second day of \nthe boy's murder trial. He is accused of shooting Jeff Hall with a \n.357 Magnum at point-blank range while he slept on a sofa in their \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a judge finds the boy murdered his father, he could be jailed \nuntil he is 23. The Associated Press is not identifying the boy \nbecause he is a juvenile.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prosecution claims the boy, now 12, killed his dad to keep him \nfrom splitting up with his stepmom, while the defense says the \nstepmother manipulated the boy to shoot Hall because she was angry he \nmight leave her for another woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy says in the video that he wanted to end his father's abuse \nand to ensure he would live with his stepmother because he thought \nthe couple was going to divorce. He said he was scared and angry \nabout his father's temper and threats.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I thought it would be a good idea to end it - to shoot my dad in the \nhead,\" he said in the video. \"I shot him because I was upset. He was \nalways taking off. He also hit me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point in the video, the boy says he thought his dad would \nrecover. \"I was choosing who should leave and I chose my dad,\" the \nboy said. \"I thought he would get out of the hospital and maybe we \ncould go back to being friends and start over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the video was shown, the boy clanked his ankle chains and rested \nhis head on the table. The judge stopped the video at one point \nbecause the boy was falling asleep\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little sister of the boy tearfully testified earlier in the day \nthat her brother had plotted the shooting days in advance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of the shooting, the girl was asleep, but she said her \nbrother told her of his plans four days earlier.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Did you know ahead of time that someone planned to shoot your \nfather?\" Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Soccio asked her.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl, now 11, also testified that she lied to authorities that \nstepmother Krista McCary told the boy to shoot Hall.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcCary initially told police she killed Hall, but testified Tuesday \nthat she was lying to protect the boy. She has pleaded guilty to one \nfelony count of child endangerment and criminal storage of a firearm.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoccio said the white supremacist beliefs of Hall, an unemployed \nplumber who was a regional leader of the National Socialist Movement, \nhad nothing to do with the crime and that the boy's history of \nviolence dated to his first day of kindergarten when he stabbed a \nteacher with a pencil.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defense claims the boy was influenced by being raised in an \nabusive, violent, racist environment where he was taught to shoot, \nattended Nazi rallies and was taken to the border once on a mission \nto learn how to keep Mexicans out of the U.S.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

    "title": "BILLY GRAHAM CAN'T RESIST POLITICAL INFLUENCE--OR IS IT HIM?",
    "words": "Religion and Politics Are Poor Teammates\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Mitch Carnell\u0014\n November 5, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tragedy of Billy Graham's endorsement of Mitt Romney is not \nGraham's choice for president of the United States. It would be the \nsame had he endorsed President Obama. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tragedy is that he made an endorsement at all. His removal of \nMormonism from his list of cults and his endorsement are simply the \nresults of human frailties.\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Graham, like so many of us, is unable to resist the warmth \ngenerated by the perception of power.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe thought that he had learned his lesson from being burned by \ngetting too close to Richard Nixon. Apparently we were wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us have placed Graham on a pedestal and assumed he could do \nno wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has all of the fame and adoration that one person could possibly \nenjoy; however, the lure of political influence is too strong for \nmere mortals to resist.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Billy Graham has the same right as any other American \ncitizen to endorse whomever he wishes  except that Graham is not any \nother citizen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe occupies the position of spiritual counselor to the world. He is a \nrole model for millions of people.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has sacrificed a spiritual leadership position on the altar of \npartisan politics. He has become one more role model tarnished by the \nallure of political influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have marveled at his ability to resist the temptations that money \ncan bring, and he has not been touched by the sins of the flesh that \nhave engulfed so many other televangelists.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe is a truly gifted communicator who can deliver a message to \nmillions of people. He has neared the finish line of a remarkable \ncareer with very few blemishes on his record.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy would he sacrifice all of this for a fleeting moment of political \ninfluence?\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of us can manage the really big moments in our lives, but it is \nall those pesky little problems that arise in the meantime that cause \nus so much heartburn and heartache.\u0014\n\u0014\nPower is a powerful magnet, and no matter how much of it we have, it \nis never enough. Politics seems to be Graham's Achilles heel. He is \nunable to stay away from its lure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem may lie with us in that we expected too much from another \nmere mortal. When the election is over and the results are known, \nGraham will get much of the credit and the far right will be \nstrengthened if Romney wins. Religious leaders will be encouraged to \nenter the political wars.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the president wins, Graham will have sacrificed his influence to \npolitics. Either way he will be the loser, and so will we.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am glad that God did not trust me with the responsibility of \njudging who on the national stage is more Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause I believe that there are no levels of Christians, I am \nautomatically disqualified as a judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nI also believe that there are no levels of sinners. We have all \nsinned and fallen short. I do know that it is un-Christian to leave \npeople without health care, food or hope. I can judge those things.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho am I as a layperson to criticize Billy Graham? I am just another \nflawed human being striving to find enough light to make it through \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am reminded of my conversation with the late Dr. John Hamrick, \nlong-term pastor of Charleston's First Baptist Church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dr. John,\" I asked, \"does it ever make you anxious about preaching \nhere where so many great pastors of the past have preached?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"At first it did until I realized that I didn't have \nto please Richard Furman. I only had to please God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Graham does not have to please Mitch Carnell. He only has to \nplease God.\u0014\n\u0014\nMitch Carnell is a consultant specializing in interpersonal and \norganizational communication\u0014",

    "words": "Why Huckabee's Wrong to Blame Public Schools \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Helms\u0014\n December 31, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nI often hear people say that the reason for our country's moral \ndecline is because we can't read the Bible in the classrooms and \nbecause we took prayer out of the schools. \u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, former Arkansas governor and Southern Baptist minister Mike \nHuckabee was asked about the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 28 \npeople dead, including 20 children.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"How could God let this happen?\" asked Fox news host Neil Cavuto.\u0014\n\u0014\nHuckabee retreated to a tired response that has been trumpeted many \ntimes by evangelicals who say the cause for much of the moral decay \nin our country is that \"we've systematically removed God from our \nschools.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHuckabee then asked, \"Should we be so surprised that schools would \nbecome a place of carnage?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAre we to believe that such an attack happened because God isn't \npresent enough in that school, or schools like Sandy Hook?\u0014\n\u0014\nMany evangelicals contend that this is the case. The blame lies with \nour government and courts, which have limited how much \"God language\" \ncan be spoken by teachers and administrators in the classrooms.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, this 20-year-old man could have attacked a place of worship \nand killed children attending Sunday school just as easily as he did \nSandy Hook Elementary School. Or this could have been a Christian \nschool.\u0014\n\u0014\nWouldn't these be places where Huckabee would say that God is present?\u0014\n\u0014\nSandy Hook was not attacked because teachers didn't lead students in \nmorning prayers or read to them from the Holy Bible every day  the \nkinds of things Huckabee would see as \"signs\" that God is present in \nthe schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nTeachers could do these things every day and not be a people of \nintegrity or even good Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, how could one simply lead prayers and read Scripture \nwithout imparting one's own personal theology in the process? Is that \ntruly the role of a public school teacher?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I understand the Christian faith, we carry the love of God with us \nwherever we go. We cannot divorce our faith from our daily lives, and \nwe shouldn't. The Spirit of Christ lives within us and is manifested \nin and through all aspects of our lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, wherever we are, Christ is there. Wherever we work, Christ \nworks. You can never systematically remove God from schools unless \nyou remove all Christians from schools. Even that would not keep God \nfrom showing up.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur government has protected the minority among us by making religion \nneutral in the schools, not by removing religion all together.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents may still pray together and Bibles are not banned, either. \nStudents can witness to friends and religious clubs can still be held \non school campuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe First Amendment is now more uniformly enforced than in past \ngenerations. It keeps the religious group in the majority in any \ncommunity, town or city from imposing its brand of religion on \nothers, while ensuring their right to practice and teach their \nreligion as they deem appropriate, just not under the umbrella of the \ngovernment.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians should be comfortable with this. It is really an extension \nof the Golden Rule.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we were in the minority as a religious group, we would want the \ngovernment protecting our rights while keeping religious beliefs of \nthe majority from being imposed upon us.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that there isn't government-sponsored prayer or Scripture \nreading does not mean God is absent from our schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod is there in the hearts and lives of many of these teachers who \nhave answered a calling to teach and lead our children. God is \nevident in how they do their work and how they love these children.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod is evident in how they respond to their needs and the requests of \ntheir parents. God is there in the faces and the laughter of the \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nI realize that there is such a loss of hope in the lives of many \ncommunities and families, and schools reflect this.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason for America's moral decline isn't that the Bible and \nprayer have been taken out of our schools, but it's that they been \ntaken out of our homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe schools are just symptomatic of the deeper problem. That's not \nthe teachers' fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt makes the challenges of learning greater in a community that is \ndevoid of love and hope. It's all the more reason why the love of \nJesus needs to be embodied by people who truly care for the students.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could the teachers and administrators at Sandy Hook have cared \nany more for the students there?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Helms is pastor of First Baptist Church in Jefferson, Ga.\u0014",

    "title": "BEFRIENDING THE DARKNESS",
    "words": "Befriending the Darkness \u0014\nThe psalms of lament shone God's hope into my manic depression. \u0014\nJohn E. Colwell \u0014\n\u0014\nI can't remember much of the conversation in that consulting room. \nJust two words lodged in my mind: manic depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil I began to respond to a sense of call to Christian ministry my \nlife had been directionless and mostly \"gray,\" but it was not until I \nwas a theological student that depression began to take a hold. I had \na driving job, delivering photographic equipment to retailers. I \nwould be driving from one delivery to another weeping. I was scared. \nI didn't know why I was crying. I wasn't consciously unhappy about \nanything (I had just gotten engaged to the woman who would become my \nwife). I wasn't consciously worried about anything. I was just \nweeping uncontrollably.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter seeing a number of general physicians, I was prescribed \nanti-depressants and referred to a psychiatrist. Once a month, I saw \nthe psychiatrist to ensure that my moods were stabilizing. I am one \nof the fortunate people for whom lithium works. Lithium is not a \n\"cure\" but an effective means of limiting the extremes of mood swing. \nWhen the lithium \"kicked in\" and my mood stabilized, life became \nmanageable. Imagine the horror of my physician when, after barely two \nyears of continuous stability, I announced that I wanted to stop \ntaking the tablets. They made me feel truncated.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Letter-boxed\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA while ago, Stephen Fry presented a series of television programs on \nthe subject of manic depression. One of his interviewees described \nbeing on lithium as being \"letter-boxed.\" When some films shot in \nwide-screen format are shown on television, the top and the bottom of \nthe television screen are blanked-out. That is precisely what it \nfeels like to be on lithium: the extremes of mania and despair have \ngone, but so has a third of your personality. You feel \ntemperamentally castrated.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll but one of those interviewed did not wish to be other than they \nwere. I'm sure this is incomprehensible to those peering in from the \noutside: who would want the despair of depression; who would want the \nembarrassment of mania?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I would do anything to be rid of the numbing desolation of \ndespair, but I note in puzzlement that, while I can write rhymes at \nany time, I can only write poetry of any approximation to quality \nwhen I am depressed. And without the mania, I never feel enthusiastic \nor completely engaged. For all the pain of it, I would rather be as I \nam than live with the unremitting grayness that was life on lithium. \nAs is true in so many aspects of life, that for which I am most \ngrateful is inextricably bound up with that which I most regret and \nloathe. I would welcome healing if I could lose the despair without \nlosing the insight and sensitivity, if I could lose the mania without \nlosing the enthusiasm and passion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut since I'm not convinced that these things can be so easily \ndistinguished, I'm not sure I want to be \"healed.\" I would rather, \nwith the apostle Paul, cling on to the promise that God's grace is \nsufficient in my weakness, and even that God is glorified in and \nthrough my weakness rather than by its removal. The one who is risen \nremains the one who was crucified. The glorified Jesus still bears \nthe wounds of his crucifixion.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiturgies of lament\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the psalms of lament, Psalm 88 is the bleakest. It seems \nentirely devoid of hope. All that is left is despair and desolation. \nBut even this psalm, for all its despair, is not entirely hopeless. \nIt is, after all, a prayer. It is addressed to God even though it \noffers no assurance that God is listening. And what a strange and \nenigmatic way for the psalm to end: \"The darkness is my closest \nfriend.\" Can it really be that the darkness itself can become a \nfriend?\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the Psalter, the traditional liturgy of the Church has been \nrich with lament and thereby remained pastorally pertinent. Sadly, \none must seriously question whether this remains the case within the \nchurches with which I am most familiar. No collection of hymns or \nsongs has ever been flawless, and every generation of the church has \nmanaged to produce its fair share of poetic and musical dross. But it \nis fair to say that the majority of contemporary songs are up-beat in \ntempo and that the balance between the affective and the confessional \nand declaratory has swung in favor of the former. This style of \nworship focuses almost exclusively on praise, adoration, and \nthanksgiving, with clapping and other expressions of exuberance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis form of worship renders it difficult to opt out, to observe, to \nsit, and to pray quietly while the performance proceeds. For the \nperson who comes as this psalmist comes, for the person wrestling \nwith any form of clinical depression, for the person tortured by the \nbreaking down of relationships, for the recently bereaved, all this \nis unrelieved torture.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny liturgy that does not include regular and broad engagement with \nthe Psalter could, in these respects, be similarly faulted. Time and \nagain the psalmists put into words, with disarming candor, feelings \nand prayers that most of us would struggle to express but echo \nnonetheless.\u0014\n\u0014\nAm I angry with God? There are psalms that name this anger. Am I \nisolated and opposed? There are psalms that express this loneliness. \nAm I despairing of justice in human society or international \nrelations? That same despair finds voice here. Am I fearful \nconcerning the future for myself and for those I love? There are \npsalms that reassure me that I am not alone in such fears.\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that the Resurrection overwhelms the Cross, but not in a \nway that negates it or obscures it. It is the crucified one who is \nrisen just as it is the risen one who was crucified. The risen and \nascended Christ still bears the marks of slaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespair is not the last word\u0014\n\u0014\nI have not taken lithium for almost thirty years. As my closest \nfamily and friends will tell you, I have certainly not \"recovered.\" \nI've just spent thirty years developing strategies for coping.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some respects the depression has easedI am rarely rendered \ncompletely numb and incapable. I rarely now descend to uncontrollable \nweeping (though it still can happen). But in other respects it is \nworse; it is more continuous. There used to be periods when I felt \nentirely \"normal,\" but now, even in the best of times, the darkness \nis a lingering presence on the margins of my mind, never wholly \nabsent, always threatening. Is this darkness truly unending? Will it \nendure forever?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Psalm 22 the psalmist cries out: \"My God, my God, why have you \nforsaken me?\" But he also confesses God's faithfulness while knowing \nno relief from his distress, no light in the darkness, no break in \nthe silence. Christ's cry of dereliction on the cross echoes the \npsalmist's cry, but we know that his cry was not the last word, nor \nthe end of the story. Our cries can similarly echo the psalmist's \ncry, and when we struggle to express our anguish, we can make his \nwords our own. But we cannot pray his prayer without coming to his \nconfession, without knowing that, as an outcome of Jesus' unique \nsuffering, our suffering and distress is not the last word. We do not \nsuffer alone and our suffering cannot possibly be final or ultimate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Son of Man has suffered, and nothing, not even our despairing \ndesolation, can ever be quite the same again.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted from Why Have You Forsaken Me?

    "title": "BREAST IRONING, A RITUAL MUTILATION OF GIRLS IN CAMEROON",
    "words": "An activist fights breast ironing, a ritual mutilation practice of \ngirls in Cameroon \u0014\nby Nia Hamm | February 20, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Cameroon, the breast, one of the most conspicuous signs of a \nwomans femininity, is a target for ritual mutilation. Breast \nironing, a practice that involves flattening a young girls breasts \nwith highly-heated stones, pestles, spatulas or coconut shells among \nother objects, is often carried out by an older female relative on a \nvictim.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is considered a human rights violation by the Friends of the \nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNPFA).\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to UNPFA, one out of every four girls in Cameroon has been \naffected by breast ironing, equating to nearly 4 million young women. \nBreast ironing is primarily practiced in the Christian and Animist \nsouth of Cameroon, and less frequently in the Muslim north, where \nonly 10 percent of women are affected. It is also practiced in \nGuinea-Bissau, Chad, Togo, Benin, and Guinea among African countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a 14-year-old girl, Chi Yvonne Leina, now 32, became a witness to \nthis custom, which is practiced by all 200 ethnic tribes in Cameroon. \nShe often went to her grandmothers hut after school, which is \nlocated in the Northwest region of Cameroon, and usually heard the \nsounds of her cousins playing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one particular day, the hut was eerily quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\n[W]hen I approached the hut I heard my cousin crying inside, Leina \ntold theGrio. I was curious, so I peeped through a small crack in \nthe door.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Leina saw next would change her life forever. I heard my cousin \ngroaning and I saw my grandmother warming a small grinding stone. \n[G]randma was using that small stone, which she warmed on the fire, \nto press my cousins breast, and was pressing hard on the breast, and \nshe was crying.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was Leina s first encounter with breast ironing. Although this \npractice can result in physical damage in addition to retarding \ndeveloping breasts, many elders condone it. Mothers or close \nrelatives of young girls who perform the practice believe breast \nironing will deter sexual predators.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who carry out breast ironing hope to minimize young girls \nsexual activity, so they get an education and become financially \nindependent. Teen pregnancy out of wedlock is on the rise in the \nregion. Such a life event curtails any hope a young woman has of \npursuing a lucrative career.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn its 2011 human rights report on Cameroon, the U.S. State \nDepartment explained the cultural motivation for stunting breast \ngrowth among adolescent girls. The procedure was considered a way to \ndelay a girls physical development, thus limiting the risk of sexual \nassault and teenage pregnancy, the report states. Girls as young as \nnine were subjected to the practice, which resulted in burns, \ndeformities, and psychological problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, there is strong evidence that breast ironing does not achieve \nthe desired goals. Statistics confirm that in addition to being a \nhuman rights violation, the practice is ineffective in deterring \npre-marital pregnancy, according to a Friends of the UNPFA press \nrelease. One-third of unwanted pregnancies occur between the ages of \n13 and 25, with more than half falling pregnant after their first \nsexual encounter.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many women, including Leinas cousin, the negative effects can be \ndeep, long-lasting, and counterproductive to personal growth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll I know is she became suddenly a shy person, which she wasnt \nbefore, Leina said. And she fell out of school and got pregnant \nsome years after.\u0014",

    "words": "Acts 5:27-32\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the first in the series of First Lesson texts from Acts of \nApostles rather than from the Older Testament designated to be read \non the Second through the Seventh Sundays of Easter in Series C. It \nis, unfortunately, a text in which Jewish religious leaders rather \nthan Roman political leaders are condemned as the ones who killed \nJesus by hanging him upon a cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe as Christian Ministers of Word and Sacrament are called to \nproclaim a message that is pro-Christ, not one that is anti-Jewish. \nSome redactional modifications will be suggested here, therefore, as \nnecessary in adapting Acts 5:27-32 for use in Christian worship \nduring our time. These are redactional modifications that should have \nbeen made prior to or during the time in which Acts of Apostles was \ncanonized and approved as Scripture for use in the Church. Since the \nmodifications were not made when they should have been made, we must \nmake them now. The Word of God is of tremendous importance to us, but \nthe People of God are of even greater importance. In instances where \nthe Word of God has hurt and continues to hurt the People of God \n(both Jewish and Christian), it must be modified redactionally. To \nparaphrase the Markan Jesus in Mark 2:27, The Word of God was made \nfor the People, not the People of God for the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nActs 5:27-32 is a thespians delight. The inspired Lukan playwright \nprovided for us a historical drama with villains and heroes. The \nreading and hearing audience is pleased when the villains in the play \nare made to look ridiculous. The audience, clearly partisan, knows \nthat in spite of great odds and difficulties God is on the side of \nthe heroes and that their success is assured. This text is not unlike \na TV drama written for our time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following redactional modifications are suggested here as \nappropriate in adapting this scene for use in our time so that the \ndrama will be effective. Doing this is somewhat analogous to what a \ndirector does in adapting a drama script to a specific modern \naudience for greater effectiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proclamation of obedience to God and the witness to the belief \nthat God has raised Jesus from the dead come across much more clearly \nwhen the vicious anti-Jewish polemic of Acts 5:30b and 31b is \nrelegated to a footnote, or at least is not used. The following is an \nexample of an expression of Acts 5:29b-31 that utilizes this kind of \nsensitivity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt begins with what in a drama presentation would be delegated to a \nchorus, We must obey God rather than obey people! From within that \nchorus Peter would continue alone with the sterling confession, We \nbelieve that the God of Our Fathers raised Jesus from the dead and \nhas exalted him as our Leader and Savior to the right hand of God \nin order to provide for our repentance and the forgiveness of our \nsins. In this sensitive expression the onus is taken from Israel \nand from the villains of this scene. Instead, the confessional \nnature of Peters speech is highlighted. The necessity of our \nrepentance and the need for the forgiveness of our sins is \nacknowledged in a manner that theologically is far more attractive \nthan if repentance is demanded of other people while it is assumed \nthat we have no need for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostolic witness that is expressed in Acts 5:32 is enhanced by \nthis biblical expression because it puts the emphasis on our \nconfession of faith. When the emphasis remains only on the alleged \nguilt of other people (the Jews) and on their need for repentance, \nthe witness is robbed of much of its power. The zeal of the inspired \nLukan writer to incorporate anti-Jewish polemic so frequently in this \nscene and elsewhere in Acts of Apostles detracts from the witness and \nfrom the confession of faith of the writer. It was the purpose of the \nLukan playwright to deflect persecution by the Romans of early \nfollowers of Jesus from these followers of Jesus to the Jews, to \nscapegoat the Jews. Other followers of Jesus in their usage of this \nmaterial and by their incorporation of it into their new canon of \nsacred Scripture obviously gave their approval. The lives of the \nfollowers of Jesus were considered to be precious; the lives of Jews \nwho remained Jews apparently were thought to be of little value. \nWithin a mature Christianity, however, we are no longer bound to the \npurpose of the Lukan writer, especially when the vicious anti-Jewish \npolemic that is present in Acts of Apostles and in other Newer \nTestament documents has been shown to have contributed to the loss of \nhuman rights and of human life to Jews for nineteen centuries and \nwhen it also detracts from an otherwise clear confession of Christian \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: This is not a conventional view of this passage\u0014",

    "words": "Bruno, Last Heretic Burned by Roman Inquisition\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn 1591, a restless philosopher named Giordano Bruno traveled to \nVenice at the invitation of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni \nMocenigo. When Bruno refused to share \"magic\" secrets with him, \nMocenigo denounced him to the Inquisition.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe Inquisition was only too happy to arrest Bruno. A former \nDominican monk, Bruno had written satirical words against Christian \nsystems in his book The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast. For years \nhe had moved from city to city in Europe, falling out with his hosts \nwherever he went because he found fault and quarreled with every one \nand every system, especially Aristotalianism. He published heretical \nbooks and obscene plays.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBruno was enthusiastic about the Copernican theory that the planets \ncircle the sun and he believed there are many other planets around \nother stars, some of them with life. (The chances of another \nearth-like planet existing without supernatural intervention are one \nin ten to the 173rd power.) Rejecting the authority of Scripture, \nBruno fell into other serious scientific errors in the remainder of \nhis cosmology. For example, he held that the universe was infinite (a \nclaim also disproved by modern astronomy). He adopted pantheistic \ntheories. God is the universal world-soul, he taught, and all \nparticular material things are manifestations of that one infinite \nprinciple. (Recent scientific and mathematical advances have refuted \nthis notion also, showing that space and time came into being from \noutside).\u0014\n\u0014\n          In theology, Bruno denied both the Trinity and the Virgin \nBirth. Questioned by the Inquisition, he may have wavered, but on the \nwhole, he stuck to his heresies, although tortured for weeks on the \nrack. Venetian authorities forwarded the records of his hearing to \nRome.\u0014\n\u0014\n         The Roman Inquisition extradited him from Venice. For six \nyears it kept him in prison without a trial. Then it ordered him to \nrecant his false beliefs. Although he knew what fate awaited him, \nBruno refused.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Giordano Bruno took his last walk early on this day, \nFebruary 17, 1600. A stake awaited him in the Campo di Fiora. Dressed \nas a heretic, his tongue clamped so that he could say nothing against \nthe church or in defense of his unacceptable views, authorities \nburned him to death.\u0014\n\u0014\n         His case was significant for several reasons. For one, he \nwas the last victim burned by the Roman Inquisition. For another, \nfear of a similar fate caused Galileo to recant his belief in the \nheliocentric theory a few years later. And lastly, Bruno's ideas \ninfluenced the pantheism of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and \nthe monadism of German thinker Gottfried von Leibniz.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bruno, Giordano.\" Dictionary of the History of Ideas.

BLOW          New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Friday President Obama picked at Americas racial wound, and it \nbled a bit. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite persistent attempts by some to divest the Trayvon \nMartin-George Zimmerman tragedy of its racial resonance, the \npresident refused to allow it. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring a press briefing, Mr. Obama spoke of the case, soberly and \ndeliberately, in an achingly personal tone, saying: You know, when \nTrayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my \nson. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me \n35 years ago. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith that statement, an exalted black man found kinship with a buried \nblack boy, the two inextricably linked by inescapable biases, one \nexpressing the pains and peril of living behind the veil of his brown \nskin while the other no longer could. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith his statements, the president dispensed with the pedantic and \nmade the tragedy personal. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe spoke of his own experiences with subtle biases, hinting at the \npsychological violence it does to the spirit  being followed around \nin stores when shopping, hearing the locking of car doors when you \napproach, noticing the clutching of purses as you enter an elevator. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is in these subtleties that black folks are forever forced to box \nwith shadows, forever forced to recognize their otherness and their \ninability to simply blend. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn The Souls of Black Folk, W. E. B. Du Bois described this \nphenomenon thusly: \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of \nalways looking at ones self through the eyes of others, of measuring \nones soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt \nand pity. One ever feels his two-ness  an American, a Negro; two \nsouls, two thoughts two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in \none dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn \nasunder. \u0014\n\u0014\nSurely, much has changed in America since Du Bois wrote those lines \nmore than a century ago  namely, bias tends to be expressed \nstructurally rather than on an individual level  but the two-ness \nremains. The reality of being marked, denied and diminished for being \nAmericas darker sons persists, even for a man who rose to become one \nof Americas brightest lights. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while words are not actions or solutions, giving voice to a \npeoples pain from The Peoples house has power. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Friday the president reached past one man and one boy and one case \nin one small Florida town, across centuries of slavery and oppression \nand discrimination and self-destructive behavior, and sought to place \nthis charged case in a cultural context. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt can be too easy when speaking of race, bias, stereotypes and \ninequality to arrive at simplistic explanations. There is often a \ntendency to separate legacy traumas and cultural conditioning from \npersonal responsibility, but it cannot be done. The truth is that \nracial realities are complicated, weaving all these factors into a \nsingle fabric. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no denying that an enormous amount of violence  both \nphysical and psychological  is aimed at black men. That violence is \nboth interracial and intraracial. Too many black men inflict that \nviolence on one another, feeding a self-destructive cycle of \nvictimization until hope is crushed to the ground and opportunity \nseems beyond the sky. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this must be considered when we speak of race, and those \nconversations cannot be a communion of the aggrieved. All parties \nmust acknowledge and accept their role in the problems for us to \nsolve them. Only when the burden of bias is shared  only when we can \nempathize with the feelings of the other  can we move beyond \ninjury to healing.\u0014",

    "words": "Bipolar Disorders Most \nSurprising Symptoms \u0014\n\u0014\nIt may be buzz-worthy these days, but many people dont fully \nunderstand bipolar disorder and the symptoms that can lead to proper \ndiagnosis and treatment. Bipolar, also sometimes called \nmanic-depressive disorder, is characterized by shifts from extreme \nhighs (known as mania) to emotional lows (depression), with normal \nmoods in between. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts bipolar disorders manic phase that most sets it apart from \nother common mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. \nWhile many people associate mania with high energy and exaggeratedly \ngood moods, these other key symptoms are more subtle: \u0014\n\u0014\n\tReckless spending. If a friend is blowing her paycheck on shopping \nsprees she cant afford, watch out. A person in a manic phase of \nbipolar disorder is more likely to take big risks, including spending \nsplurges that can lead to mountains of unmanageable debt. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSuper-charged sex drive. A sudden revving up of a person's sex \ndrive, obsessively thinking or talking about sex, or engaging in \nsexual encounters he otherwise wouldnt (like a one-night stand or \nsex with someone he doesn't know well) are all symptoms of \nhypersexuality, another less-obvious mania clue. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAlcohol or drug abuse. These often go hand-in-hand with manic \nepisodes: As many as 60 percent of people with bipolar disorder have \nabused alcohol or drugs at some point in their lives. Depressants \nsuch as alcohol or pain pills can send a person with mania straight \ninto depression, while stimulants like cocaine can have the opposite \neffect. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSkimping on shut-eye. Little need for sleep is another red flag \nthat a person may be having a manic episode.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeep in mind that bipolar disorder can vary greatly in severity, and \nnot everyone experiences every symptom. In fact, some patients \nexperience hypomania, a less mild form of mania. But even hypomania, \nif left untreated, could spin into depression or develop into \nfull-blown mania. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne important takeaway from the Archives study is that across all \ncountries, patients with bipolar disorder faced challenges in their \ndaily lives and were at increased risk of such health problems as \npanic attacks, substance abuse, and suicide. Untreated bipolar \ndisorder can also lead to troubled relationships with friends and \nfamily and problems at work. If\u0014",

    "title": "BOTH SIDES OF THE GOSPEL",
    "words": "It is easy to get sidetracked from the central message of the gospel. \nThe prophets often had to remind the people about God's main \npurposes. Thus in Isaiah 1 the Lord is reported to have asked: \"What \nto me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\" (v. 11). The Lord \nindicates there has been \"enough of burnt offerings\" and that there \nis no divine delight in blood sacrifice. \"When you come to appear \nbefore me, who asked this from your hand? Bringing offerings is \nfutile; incense is an abomination to me\" (vv. 12-13). The Lord \ncommands that the people, \"Trample my courts no more\" (v. 12c), and \nthat they \"learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, \ndefend the orphan, plead for the widow\" (v. 17).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is interesting to put this narrative of Jesus' \"keynote\" alongside \nJohn Updike's novel In the Beauty of the Lilies. This novel is the \ntale of a turn-of-the-century minister, Clarence Wilmot, who lost his \nfaith in the God he was taught in seminary. The God Wilmot was \ntaughtrationalistic, all powerful, and in controlmade no sense in \nlight of the poverty he was seeing around him. His seminary teachings \nwere like the \"twigs of an utterly dead tree,\" such \"sad sap,\" \"paper \nshields against the molten iron of natural truth\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWilmot concluded that his genteel professors had sold him on a \nmessage that was half wishful thinking, half self-promoting lies. \n\"The doctrine had for these years past felt to Clarence like an \ninvalid, a tenuous ghost scattered invisibly among the faces that \nfrom sickbeds and Sunday pews and oilclothcovered kitchen tables of \ndisrupted, impoverished households beseeched him for hope and \ncourage, for that thing which Calvin in his Gallic lucidity called la \ngrace.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point in his ministry, Wilmot decided against expanding the \nchurch buildings; he could not justify adding underused \necclesiastical structures when poor immigrants down the street slept \nsix to a room. Apparently his education did not provide him the \nwherewithal to see in that decision any link either to his faith or \nto his ministerial calling. He considered a turn to the poor to be a \nturn away from the all-powerful God. The moderator of the presbytery \nidentified his problem as having been shaped by a conservatism that \nwould not adapt to the vicissitudes of life and history. Having \nstudied the two Hodges and Warfield, theologians who could not bend, \nWilmot's faith shattered when the storms of life overwhelmed his \ndoctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe moderator was correct, but too late. The litany \"There is no God\" \nkept repeating in Wilmot's head. He never saw an alternative to the \nGod of the inflexible doctrines he learned. Wilmot ended up peddling \nencyclopedias to people who could not afford them (but bought them \nanyway), mirroring the doctrinal peddling he was trained to do as a \nminister.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilmot, steeped in authoritative Christologies, somehow missed Luke's \nJesus. If only Wilmot and his professors had opened Luke and found \nthe place where it was written: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, \nbecause he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFeasting on the Word: Preaching the Revised Common Lectionary - \nFeasting on the Word  Year C, Volume 1: Advent through \nTransfiguration.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeasting on the Word: Preaching the Revised Common Lectionary - \nFeasting on the Word  Year C, Volume 1: Advent through \nTransfiguration.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nBy JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   JAN. 10, 2014  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMayor Bill de Blasio ordered an investigation on Friday into the \ndeath of a 4-year-old boy who was beaten, tortured and starved for \nthree weeks by his caregiver, as new details of the boys horrific \nordeal emerged in court. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a tragedy in every sense, Mr. de Blasio said at a news \nconference. It was something that should never happen in this city. \nWere going to do everything in our power to save every child. That \nis our mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after the mayor spoke, the woman charged in connection with \nthe childs death, Kryzie King, 27, was brought in handcuffs before a \njudge in criminal court in Manhattan and charged with assault, \nreckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. A \nprosecutor, Nicole Blumberg, told the judge that Ms. King was under \ninvestigation for murder and that the state would likely bring \nadditional charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Blumberg said the boy, Myls Dobson, had endured three weeks of \ntorture after his father was arrested and left him in Ms. Kings care \nin mid-December. She said Ms. King admitted to the police that she \nbeat the child with a belt buckle and an electric cord, seared his \nlegs with an oven rack, gagged him with a rag and bound his wrists \nand ankles for two or three hours at a time. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. King also forced the boy to stand on an 11th-floor balcony in his \nunderwear during frigid weather on Tuesday as a punishment. She also \nstarved the child, feeding him nothing in the last days of his life. \nHe lost more than 20 pounds, prosecutors said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. King initially told detectives that Myls had fallen from a \nbathroom counter into an empty tub.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe described watching Myls die right in front of her eyes, Ms. \nBlumberg said. He was slumped over in the bathroom. His eyes were \nfluttering. He couldnt focus, until his body was completely shut \ndown. Ms. King waited a half-hour before calling 911, and called \nsome friends first, the prosecutor added.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was unclear how Myls ended up in the care of Ms. King, who had \ndated his father, Okee Wade, when Mr. Wade had relatives in New York \nand in South Carolina. Mr. de Blasio said he had directed the deputy \nmayor for health and human services, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, and the \nchildrens services commissioner, Gladys Carrion, to lead the \ninquiry. He asked them to produce a report within a week, he said, \nso we can learn what could have been done differently\u0014\n\u0014\nFor much of his life, Myls was monitored by city social workers in \nthe Administration for Childrens Services. In August 2011, the city \nagency accused the childs mother, Ashlee Dobson, of neglect and \nasked a family court judge to remove the boy from her custody, a \ncourt official with knowledge of the case said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Dobson told reporters at a news conference on Friday morning in \nManhattan that the citys Administration for Childrens Services had \ntaken her son from her because they were living in a homeless \nshelter. Through her lawyer, she said she had weekly visitations with \nMyls but had not seen him since November. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn August 2012, a New York court awarded Mr. Wade custody, but the \njudge required Mr. Wade to remain under the supervision of child \nservices social workers for a year. That supervision ended in August.\u0014",

    "words": "Study Shows US Bible Belt Has Highest Rate of Family Break-Ups; Is it \nAbout Faith or Race?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Tyler O'Neil , CP Reporter   February 14, 2014\u0014\n\u0014\nA study on family breakup as it effects children on the cusp of \nadulthood revealed that more children experience family breakup \nbefore adulthood in the South, well-known for its religious \"Bible \nbelt,\" according to the Family Research Council.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Bible belt is in deep, deep trouble on family,\" Pat Fagan, \ndirector of The Family Research Council's Marriage and Religion \nResearch Institute (MARRI), told The Christian Post in an interview \non Thursday. \"Those who worship less have more family intactness and \nthose who worship more have less,\" Fagan marveled.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Harry R. Jackson Jr, senior pastor of Hope Christian Church \nand founding president of High Impact Leadership Coalition, explained \nthe nuances of different ethnic groups, most notably the high rates \nof family dislocation in the black community. \"I think black families \nare experiencing the worst of the social trends, but they are leading \nin that direction,\" Jackson declared. \"Half of our children do not \nfeel that they are loved and accepted in their families.\" While the \nAsian family has the lowest rates of breakup, Jackson argued that \nthey are going the same way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Study and Its Results\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fourth Annual Index of Family Belonging and Rejection, published \nWednesday, measures whether or not kids who are about to become \nadults have experienced a breakup in their family. For those \"age \n15-17, towards the end of their childhood at home,\" the study \nmeasures \"what proportion of children are still in an intact, married \nfamily,\" Fagan explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the study, only 46 percent of today's youth ages 15 to \n17 were raised with both their biological parents married to each \nother since before or around the time of their birth. The parents of \n54 percent of these children have rejected each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegionally, the South, or the Bible belt, has the lowest rate of \nfamily belonging (42 percent) and the Northeast has the highest (50 \npercent). Among states, Utah ranked number one with 57 percent and \nthe District of Columbia ranked dead last with 17, followed by \nMississippi at 32 percent and Louisiana at 36 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAsians proved to be the racial group with the most families intact \namong these kids (65 percent grew up in intact families) and blacks \nhad the least (17 percent).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Failures of the Church\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christians are not living out their faith in family in the South,\" \nFagan declared. He explained that the highest churchgoing states in \nthe country are in the south, and normally high church attendance \ndrives people to keep their families intact. But this is not \nhappening. \"For the Christian church in the South, something is \nreally going wrong sexually.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to another study, published last month, divorce rates are \nhigher among conservative Protestants and evangelicals who are strict \non sexual morality than among more liberal Christians. Nevertheless, \nthe study's author admitted that \"secularism seems to be more \nconducive towards divorce than conservative Protestantism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Black Family\u0014\n\u0014\nFagan explained that the lowest rates of family belonging in the \nnation occurred in the black community  9 percent among African \nAmericans in the District of Columbia and 7 percent in Milwaukee. \n\"The black family is just in meltdown crisis on family and on \nmarriage,\" the researcher argued, \"and that's what locking them into \npoverty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson agreed, tracing the roots of this civil collapse back to \nPresident Lyndon Johnson's \"War on Poverty,\" the era of Segregation, \nand even slavery. \"I think that the baggage of the family breakdown \nworked as a cancer,\" the black pastor explained. He argued that even \nin the pre-Civil Rights days, when African American families \ngenerally stuck together, they were still under assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson traced the \"emotional erosion of our African American men \nregarding their role in family, their value as individuals,\" through \nslavery, Jim Crow, and into the 1960s. \"When the War on Poverty \nhappened in the sixties, Washington initiatives wound up exacerbating \nthe familial problems of poverty,\" Jackson claimed. The new relief \nprograms made it acceptable and economically possible for a woman to \nlive on her own and raise a family without a man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Asian-American Family\u0014\n\u0014\nDJ Chuang, a strategy consultant, ideator, connector, and Asian \nAmerican, explained the cultural ideas behind the strength of the \nAsian family. \"Generally speaking, Asian cultures have very strong \nvalues of loyalty, duty, and responsibility to care for their family \nmembers,\" Chuang argued. \"These values are culturally reinforced by \nthe societal expectations for staying in marriages, some of which are \narranged, and avoiding the social stigma and shame of divorces.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson agreed, and claimed that first generation immigrants from \nAfrica also have a similar dedication to family.\u0014\n\u0014\nFagan, however, argued that the problems are still deep, even in the \nAsian family. \"The Asian family now is where the black family was in \nthe sixties when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his book,\" the \nresearcher explained. Moynihan wrote in order to combat the \ndisintegration of the black family, and now every race is facing the \nsame challenges.\u0014",

There are about \ntwo lunar eclipses per year, according to NASA, but what's unusual \nthis time around is that there will be four blood moons within 18 \nmonths  astronomers call that a tetrad  and all of them occur \nduring Jewish holidays.\u0014\n\u0014\nA string of books have been published surrounding the event, with \nauthorsreferring to a Bible passage that refers to the moon turning \ninto blood. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into \nblood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord, Joel 2:31says.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the New Testament, Acts2:20echoes the same doom: The sun shall be \nturned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and \nnotable day of the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent books capitalizing on the event include Blood Moons: Decoding \nthe Imminent Heavenly Signs by Washington state author Mark Biltz; \nBlood Moons Rising: Bible Prophecy, Israel, and the Four Blood \nMoonsby Oklahoma pastor Mark Hitchcock; andFour Blood Moons: \nSomething Is About to Change by Texas megachurch pastor John Hagee.\u0014\n\u0014\nHagee's book is drawing the most attention, with his book now No. 4 \non The New York Times best-seller list in the advice/how to section, \nand No. 80 on USA Today's best-seller list.

The ones in April occur \nduring Passover, and the ones in October occur duringthe Jewish Feast \nof Tabernacles.\u0014\n\u0014\nJewish holy days revolve around a lunar calendar with Passover \nbeginning on the first full moon after the beginning of spring, and \nthe Feast of Tabernacles occurring on the first full moon after the \nbeginning of fall.Hagee writes that every time a tetrad occurs on \nJewish feast days, something traumatic and world-changing happens \nto Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain and Christopher Columbus \ndiscovered America, giving the Jews a place to go. In 1948, the \nmodern state of Israel was born, and in 1967, Israel won the Six-Day \nWar and recaptured Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 300-year interval from 1600 to 1900, there were no tetrads \nat all, according to NASAeclipse expert Fred Espenak.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time, Hagee suggests that a Rapture will occur where Christians \nwill be taken to heaven, Israel will go to war in a great battle \ncalled Armageddon, and Jesus will return to earth. Hagee planned a \nspecial televised eventon Tuesday(April 15) on theGlobal Evangelism \nTelevisionchannel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut NASA does not consider tetrads as especially rare, saying in a \nstatement that there will be eight sets of tetrads before the year \n2100.

    "title": "BAPTISTS IN VIRGINIA MARK 300 YEARS OF UNCOERCED FAITH",
    "words": "Baptists in Virginia mark 300 \nyears of uncoerced faith\u0014\n\u0014\nA two-day event celebrated the appeal for help from a small group of \ncolonists to Baptists in Great Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Robert Dilday,  Assocxiated Baptist Press\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1714, a small group of Baptists in Virginia asked their spiritual \ncolleagues in Britain to send messengers to strengthen the \nfledgling religious movement in the colony. The result was the first \ndocumented Baptist congregation in Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree centuries later  almost to the day  Baptists marked the \nanniversary of that event with a two-day observance in Richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur people have come a long, long way, said historian Fred Anderson \nat a service of remembrance and thanksgiving May 16. From no people \nthey have become a recognized people. From a despised people, they \nhave become prominent contributors in every walk of life.  From one \nchurch have sprung an unknown number, certainly numbering around \n3,000 churches and maybe  counting all the various groups of \nBaptists  perhaps even a million Baptists in Virginia alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nExhibits welcomed participants to the campus of the University of \nRichmond as Baptists in Virginia marked 300 years. (ABPnews/Herald \nphoto)Anderson, executive director of the Virginia Baptist Historical \nSociety and the Center for Baptist Heritage & Studies, was keynote \nspeaker at the service, which also featured an organ recital of hymns \nfamiliar to generations of Baptists. Among them was Ill Be a \nSunbeam, the theme song of the Sunbeam Band, a mission education \norganization for children created in Nelson County, Va., in 1886 \nwhich spread to most Baptist churches in the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remembrance service, organized by the two Baptist historical \ngroups, was held in the pillared sanctuary of River Road Church, \nBaptist  a marked contrast to the log structure in Prince George \nCounty which probably housed Virginias first Baptist congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut those simple beginnings inspired a Christian movement ready to \nanswer key questions of spiritual life, said John Upton, executive \ndirector of the Baptist General Association of Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists emerged, in my mind, as a way for each believer to offer \nGod their own answers rather than having some religious organization \nanswer them for us, Upton, who also is president of the Baptist \nWorld Alliance, told participants at the remembrance service. \nBaptists gave each believer a way to answer those questions in their \nmany layers rather than just the surface ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn particular, he added, they urged believers to come as you are and \nrisk a personal new experience of faith  uncoerced.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe anniversary celebration continued the next day on the campus of \nthe University of Richmond  founded by Baptists in 1830 to train \nministers  with about 40 exhibits by Baptist agencies, institutions \nand churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nScattered beginnings\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first Baptist congregation in America is generally thought to be \nFirst Baptist Church in Providence, R.I., organized in 1638. Some \nevidence also exists of a Baptist presence in Virginia in the 17th \ncentury, but the group was small, scattered along the south side of \nthe James River, and faced legal restrictions imposed by the official \nAnglican Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking for assistance, the struggling group sent a letter to the \nBaptist church in Canterbury  ironically, the episcopal seat of the \nAnglican Church  which passed the appeal along to the Kentish \nBaptist Association in southeast England. On May 19, 1714, the \nassociation appointed two messengers to go to Virginia with all \nconvenient speed.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater that month the general assembly of English Baptists endorsed \nthe action, instructing the messengers to preach the gospel where it \nis not known; to plant churches where there is none; to ordain elders \nin churches remote; and to assist in dispensing the Holy Mysteries.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne messenger died on the Atlantic crossing but the other, Robert \nNorden, arrived the following spring and by June 1715 had organized a \nchurch in Prince George County. The congregation worshipped in a \nprivate residence which the county court had approved as a publick \nmeeting house for these persons called Annabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next year Norden wrote Baptists in England of the promising \nprospect to plant the Gospell in those parts and reported that he \nhad in a little time baptized and settled 18 Persons in Gospell \norder. Norden died in 1725.\u0014\n\u0014\nA familiar fate\u0014\n\u0014\nAnderson said its uncertain what became of that first church, though \nsome records suggest it was decimated by theological divisions and \nbecame extinct.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first Baptist church in Virginia appears to have suffered the \nfate of many Baptist churches  implosion from doctrinal controversy, \nthe relocating of members and the gradual decline of what had been an \nactive congregation, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nVirginias legal and religious establishment regarded Baptists as an \nignorant and illiterate sect, and placed restrictions on their \nability to preach and worship. In some places they were tolerated; in \nothers, they were openly persecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe genius of those early Baptists, however, is clear, said Anderson:\u0014\n\u0014\n Out of persecution they birthed the principles of religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\n The essence of their polity was free and autonomous congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\n They readily embraced a concept of world mission which took them \nbeyond their small meeting houses.\u0014\n\u0014\n A commitment to mission led inevitably to a wide array of Christian \neducational and benevolent organizations.\u0014\n\u0014\n They turned out generations of well-trained, well-equipped laity \nand clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Norden was planting seeds of Baptist principles three \ncenturies ago, said Anderson. Every phase of Baptist work in \nVirginia has sprung from those seeds. The seeds are still hidden in \ncrevices and cracks and when conditions are ripe, suddenly Baptist \nprinciples and Baptist work blooms once more.\u0014",

    "title": "BIRTHDAY OF CONGREGATIONALISM",
    "words": "Birthday of Congregationalism?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes your church have a congregational government? If local members \nmake its decisions rather than an outside bishop or presbytery, then \nyour form of church government is congregational. It is one of the \nmost common ways that Protestants govern their churches throughout \nthe world today.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did congregationalism begin? There are several suggestions. Some \nwriters say the earliest churches planted by the apostles were run by \nlocal congregations. However, most historians look at it as arising \nwithin a tide of democratic ideals in the sixteenth century which it \nfed and to which it contributed. They often point to this day, June \n19, 1567 as a red letter day in its origin.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was the day that Richard Fitz and several others were arrested \nin Plumber's Hall, London. To understand why, we need to remind \nourselves of conditions of that day. Many Englishmen and women were \nunhappy with the Church of England. According to some it went too far \nin reform. According to others, not far enough. Some of this last \ngroup called for purifying the church. They were called Puritans. \nOthers wished to separate themselves entirely from the Church of \nEngland. They became known as Separatists.\u0014\n\u0014\nAround 1550 small, secret congregations of Separatists sprang up. One \nwas led by Richard Fitz and John Robinson (who later played a key \nrole as leader of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to America). Their \nmovements are hard to trace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Separatists really surfaced when they established what they \ncalled a \"Privye\" or private church, one that would not answer to \nEnglish bishops or to Rome or any other religious authority. In \nshort, it would be governed by its own pastor and members. This put \nthem on a collision course with the queen who was head of the Church \nof England and personally liked the color, splendor and ritual of \nworship that the Puritans and Separatists detested.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne particular band of Separatists, reported as a hundred strong, \nrented Plumber's Hall to celebrate a wedding. Before the nuptials \nwere fairly under way, the sheriff broke up the meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe and his men arrested Richard Fitz, a deacon and others. Many of \nthese Plumber's Hall Separatists spent time in prison for illegal \nreligious activities. We know from a petition later put forth by the \nSeparatists that Fitz and several others paid for their religious \nviews with their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDale, R. W.

    "words": "Bruno, Last Heretic Burned by Roman Inquisition\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn 1591, a restless philosopher named Giordano Bruno traveled to \nVenice at the invitation of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni \nMocenigo. When Bruno refused to share \"magic\" secrets with him, \nMocenigo denounced him to the Inquisition.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe Inquisition was only too happy to arrest Bruno. A former \nDominican monk, Bruno had written satirical words against Christian \nsystems in his book The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast. For years \nhe had moved from city to city in Europe, falling out with his hosts \nwherever he went because he found fault and quarreled with every one \nand every system, especially Aristotelianism. He published heretical \nbooks and obscene plays.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBruno was enthusiastic about the Copernican theory that the planets \ncircle the sun and he believed there are many other planets around \nother stars, some of them with life. (The chances of another \nearth-like planet existing without supernatural intervention are one \nin ten to the 173rd power.) Rejecting the authority of Scripture \nBruno fell into other serious scientific errors in the remainder of \nhis cosmology. For example, he held that the universe was infinite (a \nclaim also disproved by modern astronomy). He adopted pantheistic \ntheories. God is the universal world-soul, he taught, and all \nparticular material things are manifestations of that one infinite \nprinciple. (Recent scientific and mathematical advances have refuted \nthis notion also, showing that space and time came into being from \noutside).\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn  theology, Bruno denied both the Trinity and the Virgin Birth. \nQuestioned by the Inquisition, he may have wavered, but on the whole, \nhe stuck to his heresies, although tortured for weeks on the rack. \nVenetian authorities forwarded the records of his hearing to Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Inquisition extradited him from Venice. For six years it \nkept him in prison without a trial. Then it ordered him to recant his \nfalse beliefs. Although he knew what fate awaited him, Bruno refused.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiordano Bruno took his last walk early on February 17, 1600. A stake \nawaited him in the Campo di Fiora. Dressed as a heretic, his tongue \nclamped so that he could say nothing against the church or in defense \nof his unacceptable views, authorities burned him to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis case was significant for several reasons. For one, he was the \nlast victim burned by the Roman Inquisition. For another, fear of a \nsimilar fate caused Galileo to recant his belief in the heliocentric \ntheory a few years later. And lastly, Bruno's ideas influenced the \npantheism of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and the monadism \nof German thinker Gottfried von Leibniz.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bruno, Giordano.\" Dictionary of the History of Ideas.

    "title": "BIBLICAL ADVERTISING: MESSAGE OF HOPE OR DESPAIR",
    "words": "Biblical Hospital Advertising: Message of Hope or Despair?\u0014\n06/29/2014 , Maria Mayo, Ph.D. Huffington Post\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Thomas Health is the second-largest hospital system in Nashville, \nTennessee. This spring, they launched a sweeping multi-media \nadvertising campaign centered on a verse from the Gospel of Luke: \n\"For with God, nothing shall be impossible - Luke 1:37.\" On \nbillboards, park benches, city buses, and television commercials, \nthis text accompanies striking photographs of newborn babies, cancer \nsurvivors, and other exuberant patients being cared for in \nwheelchairs or hospital beds. Like a promise, the ads suggest to \nfaithful Christians that miracles are possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy daily commute takes me past St. Thomas's west Nashville location. \nAs often as I see ambulances or helicopters arrive at the hospital, I \nalso see slow-moving hearses pass below the banner as they exit the \ncomplex. For every \"miracle\" that happens in those buildings, \nsuffering and death rain down tenfold. I began to wonder how grieving \nfamilies or patients discharged from the hospital with serious pain \nor disability might read that scripture. \"Miracles can happen,\" it \nseems to say, \"just not to you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a surgery at St. Thomas two years ago that left her with \nchronic pain even today, Eve Davidson, 34, received the message this \nway. \"The ads make me feel like I am unworthy of being healed,\" she \nreflects. \"Every time I see that banner I am reminded that 'nothing \nshall be possible' to heal me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, the campaign strikes a negative chord for many. Rev. Viki \nMatson is the director of Vanderbilt Divinity School's Field \nEducation program and formerly a chaplain at St. Thomas Health \n(1985-1996). \"At times of great spiritual anguish for patients and \nfamilies, I find it completely inappropriate that the hospital that \nis charged with their care would make promises about God they simply \ncannot keep,\" she says. \"Implying that miracles happen in this \nhospital, that the impossible is somehow possible, is a slickly \nmarketed version of snake oil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer hospice chaplain Peter Capretto expresses a similar concern. \n\"The ad campaign walks a fine line between expressing an essential \nChristian motivation in healthcare and capitalizing on the religious \nexpectations of vulnerable individuals and families,\" he says. \"While \nthe fiscal outcomes of the message may be measurable, the social and \nspiritual consequences to patients and their loved ones are not, \nwhich is precisely the danger.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLess grandiose than its current advertising campaign, St. Thomas's \nlong-standing mission reads, \"Rooted in the loving ministry of Jesus \nas healer, we commit ourselves to serving all persons with special \nattention to those who are poor and vulnerable,\" it reads. A typical \nday at St. Thomas begins with a prayer over the hospital-wide \nintercom, and a crucifix hangs on the wall of every patient room. St. \nThomas is unapologetic about its Catholic foundation and commitment \nto the spiritual health of patients. However, the advertising \ncampaign appears to take this a step further and move from spiritual \nhealth to spiritual manipulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nRepresentatives of St. Thomas Health and the Bohan Advertising Agency \nwere quick to defend and celebrate the campaign as well as cite the \neffort they put into getting it right. \"We wrestled with this \n[concern] a lot,\" says Jeremi Griggs, who directs the St. Thomas \naccount with Bohan. \"What does this mean to people in bad situations?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGriggs explains that the scripture isn't a promise that miracles will \nhappen, but rather an expression of hope. \"We believe that with God, \nthe impossible can happen,\" he says. \"If it doesn't turn out that \nway, with God I can move on, I can see a bigger plan, or I can \nrecover.\" He points out that St. Thomas Health views itself as a \nministry, and this message of hope is its defining feature.\u0014\n\u0014\nRebecca Climer, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications \nOfficer of St. Thomas Health, agrees and points out that the campaign \nis the product of a two-year \"purpose initiative\" and process of \ndiscernment. \"[We] are not ignoring or insensitive to the fact that \nlives end, injuries and illness happen, and work is difficult,\" reads \na disclaimer of the campaign on the hospital's website. \"We are \nsaying that, by working together as one healing community and within \nthe will of God, we bring about the reign of God here on earth.\" Like \nGriggs, Climer emphasizes the \"hopeful\" message and notes that the \ncampaign is \"inspirational and aspirational.\" And like Griggs, she is \nquick to point out, \"We do not want to trade on our faith.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Griggs and Climer insist that St. Thomas Health does not want to \n\"trade on its faith.\" But by presenting Luke 1:37 as the central \nmotif of a large, multimedia advertising campaign, that is exactly \nwhat they are doing. The scripture combined with inspirational \nphotographs of people at various stages of surviving various ailments \nsuggests that such survival is possible, and it is especially \npossible at St. Thomas Health because God is on their side.\u0014",

He brought with him thirty other recruits. \nWith that kind of zeal, it is not surprising that three years later \nhe was appointed abbot of his own monastery. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe monastery was as yet only in the mind. He and twelve followers \nset out to build it. On this day, June 25th, 1115, in an isolated \nvalley in Champagne, France, he founded the famed monastery of \nClairvaux. As was true of other Cistercians, he sought a return to \nthe strict rule of St. Benedict. Bernard disciplined himself so \nstrictly with fasts and hard work that his health was permanently \ndamaged. His followers had to appeal to him for a relaxation of the \nstern regimen, for they could not bear the austerities he demanded of \nhimself and of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite this, Clairvaux grew so rapidly that it soon founded sister \nmonasteries. Bernard himself founded 70. These in turn founded \nothers. Thanks to his zeal, the Cistercian order was among the \nfastest growing order of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis stirring sermons lent impetus to Cistercian growth. Catholics and \nProtestants alike have held his writings in high esteem. Protestants \nhave an especial regard for On Grace and Free Will, a carefully \nreasoned treatise on the perplexing subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard was spiritually minded. His teachings focus on love and \nholiness. They are saturated with allusions to scripture and, indeed, \nthe Cistercians gave prominence to God's word. Bernard also discussed \nthe role of the Holy Spirit. He argued vehemently against those, like \nAbelard, who would introduce a spirit of doubt into theology. He \nwanted God to be known and adored. Many spiritual hymns are \nattributed to him, for example:\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the very thought of thee,\u0014\nwith sweetness fills my breast;\u0014\nbut sweeter far thy face to see\u0014\nand in thy presence rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time Bernard was a practical and active man. Not only \ncould he cause monasteries to spring up where none had been before, \nbut he also took part in the affairs of his day. He preached in \nsupport of the Second Crusade. It failed. He threw all his influence \nbehind Innocent II against rival claimant Anacletus II. Thanks in \nlarge part to Bernard, Innocent II was acknowledged as true pope. \nBernard wrote the rule for the new order of the Knights Templars, \nsworn to defend the Holy Land. He sent hundreds of influential \nletters to the leaders of his era and made peace between a French \nking and his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what became of Clairvaux? After the French Revolution, its cells \nceased to house monks and housed prisoners instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux.

    "words": "Baseball Hero's Faith in Tragedy\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Denison | Denison Forum on Truth and Culture | Thursday, July 31, \n2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1950, CBS broadcast the first television program in color. The \nDiner's Club card became the first \"credit card\" to be accepted at \nmultiple retail establishments. The Soviet Union began putting \nnuclear missiles on submarines. And Vin Scully began announcing \nDodgers baseball games. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe team was in Brooklyn, and Red Barber was its other announcer. In \n1953, Barber went to work for the rival New York Yankees, and Scully \ntook over as the Dodgers' primary play-by-play man. He has continued \nin this role for 65 years, and announced Tuesday night that he will \nreturn next year for his 66th season. \u0014\n\u0014\nScully is already a legend in the game. He is the youngest-ever World \nSeries broadcaster (he was 25 when he announced the World Series in \n1953). He is one of the few baseball announcers who broadcasts all \nnine innings, by himself. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame \nin 1982. No one in sports broadcasting is more beloved. And no one \nhas endured more tragedy with greater faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nScully grew up in New York City, the child of a devout Roman Catholic \nhomemaker. He has been a committed Catholic Christian since \nchildhood. His faith was severely tested in 1972 when his 35-year-old \nwife died of an accidental medical overdose, leaving him with three \nchildren. In 1994, his oldest son died in a helicopter crash at the \nage of 33. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow has he coped with such loss? According to Scully, \"the worst \nthing you can do in times of trial is to stop praying. The tough \nmoments are when you need God the most. He's always there and more \nthan happy to give us his help; we need only ask for it. There are so \nmany good things about the Church, but that might be the most \nessential thing I've learned from it: the importance of continual \ncommunication with God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nVin Scully is not unique in his commitment to Jesus and the power of \nprayer, of course. But he has a unique platform by which to make that \ncommitment public. He has lived with such integrity that Los Angeles \nand the larger baseball world venerate him. When his return for next \nseason was announced at the Dodgers game, the crowd of nearly 50,000 \ngave him a 75-second standing ovation. His decision made headlines in \nthe sports world, and continues to be discussed today. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou may not speak to millions of listeners for 66 years, but God has \ngiven you a voice that is just as unique for those you influence. Do \nyou know your Kingdom assignment? Are you submitted to God's Spirit \nand call on your life today? Do you believe that the Father will use \nyour every act of obedience for his eternal glory and your greatest \ngood? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Dodgers fans finally ended their ovation Tuesday night, Vin \nScully responded simply: \"All I can say is thank God and please God \nfor another year.\" Thank God and please GodI don't know a better way \nto live today.

    "words": "Herod Antipas smiled and nodded with approval. His step-daughter \nSalome* swayed and twirled in front of him and his birthday-party \nguests, her graceful figure filling them with longing. Her \nperformance done, Herod and the guests applauded. What a dance! \nInflamed by his senses and the mood of the moment, Herod cried, \"Ask \nme what you want--up to half my kingdom--and it is yours!\" And he \nswore a great oath to confirm his promise.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Tetrarch (ruler of one quarter of a Roman province) Herod was \nmore than able to provide a handsome gift even by first century \nstandards. Would Salome ask for a jeweled necklace? A dowry? A house? \nHerod and the guests waited to hear her request. The girl herself \nhesitated. Uncertain what to ask for, she whispered with her mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nDown in the dungeons of Herod's fortress (named Machaerus) a man's \nfate was about to be decided. John the Baptizer was under lock and \nkey in one of those gloomy holds. The cause was this: he had rebuked \nHerod for stealing another man's wife--Herodias. This woman had been \nmarried to Herod's quiet half-brother, Phillip. Herodias was furious, \nand convinced Herod to arrest John. Herod was only too willing; he \nwas suspicious of the large crowds John attracted.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, once Herod got John in his lockup, he talked with him and \nfound he liked the guy. He didn't understand what John was saying \nabout holiness and salvation, but it seemed to be something he should \nhear. Instead of executing John, he gave him visitation privileges. \nExecution would be a bad idea, anyway: John had a lot of followers; \nwhy make them mad and risk rebellion?\u0014\n\u0014\nSalome approached Herod. Evidently she had made up her mind. The \nguests and the king turned to hear what she would ask.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Give me now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter!\" said the \ngirl. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven that reckless, hardened lot must have drawn sharp breaths at the \ngruesome request. How quickly the indulgent mood melted. Did Herod's \nface change? Here was an awkward demand! Used to thinking of people \nas objects, used to beheading men at a whim, it never occurred to him \nto say, \"An incorruptible prophet like John the Baptizer is worth \nmore than my whole kingdom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking around at his guests, he saw only one thing.

The attack occurred June 1 in Attagara, \nGwoza district, an area that is now controlled by the Muslim \nextremist militants. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the attack, Attagara was swarmed by more than 100 Boko Haram \nmembers on a rampage to kill residents. Men women and children were \nattacked with machetes and militants opened fire at the village. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe six-year-old child was wounded from machete slashes, but survived \nthe initial attack. When a villager found him, Boko Haram militants \nswiped the boy from the villagers arms and beheaded the child. The \nvillager, Sawaltha Wandala, was then beaten and left to die. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, Boko Haram returned to Attagara for another attack \ntargeting Christians and Shiite Muslims. Christian resident John \nYakuba was captured in the attack. \u0014\n\u0014\nMilitants reportedly said, We know youre John. You must convert to \nIslam or else you will die a painful death. \u0014\n\u0014\nYakuba responded, You can kill my body, but not my soul. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was brutally attacked while tied to a tree, but miraculously \nsurvived. Yakuba now says he forgives the evil acts of the \nterrorists. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Voice of the Martyrs, the two attacks on Attagara \nvillage killed approximately 200 people. \u0014\n\u0014\nPublication date: August 29, 2014\u0014",

Many young men have been \nordained; few began as rich Borden or used their wealth as generously \nfor the sake of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Borden's wealth which showed him the need for Evangelization \nof the world. Few sixteen year olds can afford a world tour. Borden \ncould. It was while making this tour that he woke to the desperate \nneed of the world's people for the gospel. He determined to carry the \nmessage to the most difficult clientele he could imagine, Chinese \nMuslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpiritually precocious, Borden was a director of Moody Bible \nInstitute, National Bible Institute, and the China Inland Mission in \nhis early twenties. Among the leaders of the Christian world movement \nwho influenced him were Samuel Zwemer, Apostle to Islam, and John R. \nMott of Student Evangelism Movement fame.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe trained at Yale University (accordingly, he is often called Borden \nof Yale) and at Princeton. Many do not avail themselves of the \nopportunities that are at hand. Borden, however, did not wait to \nreach China to begin his missionary work. He funded the Yale Hope \nMission while still training. It was while he was at Princeton that \nhe was ordained.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1912 Borden offered himself for the China Inland Mission. Upon his \nacceptance, he sailed for Cairo, Egypt, proposing to study Arabic in \nNorth Africa before going on to his work among China's Muslims. But \nin Egypt he contracted cerebrospinal meningitis and died in 1913. He \nwas only 26.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis loss of a rich young ruler who had given up all for Christ \ngalvanized many Christians into action. Mrs. Howard Taylor wrote a \nbiography of him which inspired a multitude of recruits for mission \nservice. Even his wealth effectively advanced his purposes after he \nwas gone, for in his will he left almost a million dollars to \nChristian causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor, Mrs. Howard.

    "title": "BROTHER WHO DOOMED ETHEL ROSENBERG DIES",
    "words": "David Greenglass, the Brother Who Doomed Ethel Rosenberg, Dies at 92\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ROBERT D. McFADDEN   OCT. 14, 2014    New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the most notorious spy case of the Cold War  the conviction \nand execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for passing atomic \nsecrets to the Soviet Union  and it rested largely on the testimony \nof Ms. Rosenbergs brother David Greenglass, whose name to many \nbecame synonymous with betrayal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor his role in the conspiracy, Mr. Greenglass, an Army sergeant who \nhad stolen nuclear intelligence from Los Alamos, N.M., went to prison \nfor almost a decade, then changed his name and lived quietly until a \njournalist tracked him down. He admitted then, nearly a half-century \nlater, that he had lied on the witness stand to save his wife from \nprosecution, giving testimony that he was never sure about but that \nnevertheless helped send his sister and her husband to the electric \nchair in 1953.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Greenglass died on July 1, a family member confirmed. He was 92. \nHis family did not announce his death; The New York Times learned of \nit in a call to the nursing home where he had been living under his \nassumed name. Mr. Greenglasss wife, Ruth, who had played a minor \nrole in the conspiracy and also gave damning testimony against the \nRosenbergs, died in 2008.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn todays world, where spying has more to do with greed than \nideology, the story of David Greenglass and the Rosenbergs is an \nenduring time capsule from an age of uncertainties  of world war \nagainst fascism, Cold War with the Soviets, and shifting alliances \nthat led some Americans to embrace utopian communism and others to \ndenounce such ideas, and their exponents, as un-American.\u0014\nMr. Greenglass, who grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in a \nhousehold that believed Marxism would save humanity, was an ardent, \npreachy Communist when drafted by the Army in World War II, but no \none in the barracks took him very seriously, much less believed him \ncapable of spying.\u0014\nHe was not well educated, but his skills as a machinist  and pure \nluck  led to his assignment in 1944 to the Manhattan Project at Los \nAlamos, where Americas first atomic bombs were being developed. \nAfter being picked to replace a soldier who had gone AWOL, he lied on \nhis security clearance report and was assigned to a team making \nprecision molds for high-explosive lenses used to detonate the \nnuclear core.\u0014\n\\\u0014\nWhen Mr. Rosenberg, already a Soviet spy, learned of his \nbrother-in-laws work, he recruited him. Security was often lax at \nLos Alamos, with safes and file cabinets left unlocked and classified \ndocuments lying on desks. Mr. Greenglass had no need for Hollywood \nspy tricks. He kept his eyes and ears open, and in mid-1945 sent Mr. \nRosenberg a crude sketch and 12 pages of technical details on the \nbomb.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat September, after the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki were \ndestroyed with atomic bombs, ending the war, David and Ruth \nGreenglass visited the Rosenbergs apartment in New York. What \nhappened there later became a matter of life and death, for as Mr. \nGreenglass delivered his latest spy notes, a woman  either his wife \nor his sister  sat at a Remington typewriter and typed them out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe significance of that act did not become evident for five years. \nBy then the Soviet Union, once Americas ally, had become a Cold War \nfoe, witch hunts for suspected Communists were underway, and spy \nnetworks were being broken up. Klaus Fuchs, a physicist who had \nworked at Los Alamos, was caught, and named Harry Gold as a courier. \nMr. Gold then named the Greenglasses and the Rosenbergs, who were \narrested in 1950.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Greenglass admitted passing secrets to Mr. Rosenberg, but refused \nat first to implicate his sister. But just before the Rosenberg \ntrial, Mr. Greenglass changed his story. Told that Ruth had informed \nF.B.I. agents that Ethel had typed his notes, he supported his wifes \naccount and agreed to testify against his sister and her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Greenglass was under intense pressure. He had not yet been \nsentenced, and his wife, the mother of his two small children, faced \npossible prosecution, though her role had been minimal. In federal \ncourt in Manhattan in 1951, Mr. Greenglasss testimony  corroborated \nby his wifes  clinched the case against Mr. Rosenberg and \nimplicated Mrs. Rosenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nReferring to Ethel Rosenberg in ringing hyperbolic phrases, the chief \nprosecutor, Irving H. Saypol, declared, Just so had she, on \ncountless other occasions, sat at that typewriter and struck the \nkeys, blow by blow, against her own country in the interests of the \nSoviets.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jury found the Rosenbergs guilty of espionage conspiracy, and the \npresiding judge, Irving R. Kaufman, sentenced them to death. Appeals \nfailed, and the Rosenbergs, who rejected all entreaties to name \ncollaborators and insisted they were not guilty, were executed at \nSing Sing on June 19, 1953. A co-defendant, Morton Sobell, was also \nconvicted and was imprisoned for 18 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Greenglass was not prosecuted. Mr. Greenglass was sentenced to \n15 years, but was released in 1960 after nine and a half. He rejoined \nhis wife and for decades lived quietly in the New York area, working \nas a machinist and inventor.\u0014\n\u0014\nA 1983 book by Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton, The Rosenberg File: A \nSearch for the Truth, rekindled interest, concluding that Mr. \nRosenberg was a dedicated spy but that his wife had played only a \nminor role, and raising questions about the evidence and the \ngovernments tactics in the case. Mr. Radosh and Sol Stern also \ninterviewed Mr. Greenglass for an article in The New Republic.\u0014\n\u0014\nSam Roberts, a Times editor and reporter, later found Mr. Greenglass \nand, after a 13-year effort, obtained 50 hours of interviews that led \nto a book, The Brother: The Untold Story of the Rosenberg Case. In \nthe book, Mr. Greenglass admitted that, to spare his wife from \nprosecution, he had testified that his sister typed his notes. In \nfact, he said, he could not recall who had done it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont remember that at all, Mr. Greenglass said. I frankly think \nmy wife did the typing, but I dont remember.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said he had no regrets. My wife is more important to me than my \nsister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 2008 interview with Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sobell admitted that he had \ngiven military secrets to the Soviet Union, and concurred in what has \nbecome a consensus among historians: that the Greenglass-Rosenberg \natomic bomb details were of little value to the Soviets, except to \ncorroborate what they already knew, and that Ethel Rosenberg had \nplayed no active role in the conspiracy.\u0014",

The world had never seen anything like \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDespite its benefits, there was doubt it would be ratified by the \nindividual states. Having recently escaped one tyranny, the people of \nthe United States did not want to subject themselves to another. They \nfeared the new constitution because, while it specified the rights of \nthe new government, and gave such rights as the writ of habeas \ncorpus, it did not list other rights that the people felt it should. \nThese could be inferred, but the majority of Americans felt safer \nhaving them spelled out.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFor the most part, those who were for the federal system were for \nthe constitution as it stood. Those who opposed a federal system, \nwanted more guarantees of rights. Several state conventions asked for \nsuch a bill. Thomas Jefferson urged that they be given their wish. A \n\"bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every \ngovernment on earth, general or particular, and what no just \ngovernment should refuse, or rest on inference.\" The U. S. Congress \nagreed and by a two thirds majority passed ten amendments to the \nconstitution, called the Bill of Rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified. It \nis significant to church history because of its first Amendment: \n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof..\" This amendment was the \nresult of long centuries of efforts by religious groups such as the \nQuakers and Baptists to obtain religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first amendment meant that the Federal government of the United \nStates could not establish a national church, such as was common in \nmany other nations. Anyone could worship as he or she pleased and the \nFederal government could not say \"boo\" except under special \ncircumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederal civil rights are not obligatory for states, however. At the \nstate level, established churches continued to exist for some years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany battles have been fought in the courts over just what this \namendment means. Today, when its words are used as an excuse to \nforbid children to pray in school or read a Bible on school property, \nit is good to remember that in the understanding of the generation \nthat adopted the amendment was not that the government should oppose \nreligion or deny it the same rights of expression enjoyed by other \norganizations, but rather that it not impose a national religion nor \nstop people from engaging in their preferred form of worship. It \nguaranteed freedom for worship, not freedom from religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bill of Rights in the United States of America.\" \nhttp://www.magnacartaplus.org/usa-rights/\u0014\nBowen, Catherine Drinker.

Although they are not \nsharing this, Geo the Dad was recently laid off so you can imagine \nhow truly these clothes were a godsend.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you could please share with Cindy's family how much their \nthoughtfulness meant to us. At a very difficult time and with such a \ndifficult loss, I hope they know how much their kindness meant to \nCarol, Sara and myself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThanks again,\u0014\nGayle\u0014\nJanuary 25, 2015\u0014",

    "title": "BRUNO, LAST HEERETIC BURNED BY ROMAN INQUISITION",
    "words": "Bruno, Last Heretic Burned \nby Roman Inquisition\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1591, a restless philosopher named Giordano Bruno traveled to \nVenice at the invitation of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni \nMocenigo. When Bruno refused to share \"magic\" secrets with him, \nMocenigo denounced him to the Inquisition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Inquisition was only too happy to arrest Bruno. A former \nDominican monk, Bruno had written satirical words against Christian \nsystems in his book The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast. For years \nhe had moved from city to city in Europe, falling out with his hosts \nwherever he went because he found fault and quarreled with every one \nand every system, especially Aristotalianism. He published heretical \nbooks and obscene plays.\u0014\n\u0014\nBruno was enthusiastic about the Copernican theory that the planets \ncircle the sun and he believed there are many other planets around \nother stars, some of them with life. (The chances of another \nearth-like planet existing without supernatural intervention are one \nin ten to the 173rd power.) Rejecting the authority of Scripture \nBruno fell into other serious scientific errors in the remainder of \nhis cosmology. For example, he held that the universe was infinite (a \nclaim also disproved by modern astronomy). He adopted pantheistic \ntheories. God is the universal world-soul, he taught, and all \nparticular material things are manifestations of that one infinite \nprinciple. (Recent scientific and mathematical advances have refuted \nthis notion also, showing that space and time came into being from \noutside).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn theology, Bruno denied both the Trinity and the Virgin Birth. \nQuestioned by the Inquisition, he may have wavered, but on the whole, \nhe stuck to his heresies, although tortured for weeks on the rack. \nVenetian authorities forwarded the records of his hearing to Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Inquisition extradited him from Venice. For six years it \nkept him in prison without a trial. Then it ordered him to recant his \nfalse beliefs. Although he knew what fate awaited him, Bruno refused.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiordano Bruno took his last walk early on this day, February 17, \n1600. A stake awaited him in the Campo di Fiora. Dressed as a \nheretic, his tongue clamped so that he could say nothing against the \nchurch or in defense of his unacceptable views, authorities burned \nhim to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis case was significant for several reasons. For one, he was the \nlast victim burned by the Roman Inquisition. For another, fear of a \nsimilar fate caused Galileo to recant his belief in the heliocentric \ntheory a few years later. And lastly, Bruno's ideas influenced the \npantheism of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and the monadism \nof German thinker Gottfried von Leibniz.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bruno, Giordano.\" Dictionary of the History of Ideas.

    "words": "BOSTON'S WINTER FROM HELL\u0014\n\u0014\nBy E. J. GRAFFFEB. 20, 2015 NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass.  BY now youve seen the starkly beautiful shots of \nBoston buried under snow: the panoramic city under a white blanket; \nsnowbanks so high they crest over parked cars; piercing icicles \nglinting for two full stories from gutters dammed with ice; \ncoat-muffled people dwarfed by snow-walled corridors that once were \nsidewalks.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou may have seen the funny images as well: the man snowboarding down \nan all-but-empty major boulevard, pulled by his friends snowmobile; \ndrunk men diving out of second-floor windows into six-foot snowbanks; \nwindows that merely frame a wall of snow.\u0014\n\u0014\n           But for those of us living here, its not a pretty \npicture. We are being devastated by a slow-motion natural disaster of \nhistoric proportions. The disaster is eerily quiet. There are no \nfloating bodies or vistas of destroyed homes. But theres no denying \nthat this is a catastrophe. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn just three weeks, between Jan. 27 and Feb. 15, we have had four \nepic blizzards  seven feet of precipitation over three weeks  which \ncrushed roofs, burst gutters, destroyed roads and sidewalks, closed \nschools and businesses, shut down highways, crippled public transit \nand trapped people in their homes. The infamous Blizzard of 1978 \nbrought around 27 inches of snow and shut down the region for a week. \nIn less than a month, weve seen more than three times as much snow. \nThe temperature has hovered between 5 and 25 degrees, so the snow and \nice havent melted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDecades of underinvestment and alleged mismanagement of the \nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, known as the T, have \nmeant that the nations oldest subway system has been partly or \nentirely halted for nearly a month. (The head of the agency abruptly \nresigned last week amid criticism.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn Twitter, a satirical map of the transit system has circulated, \nwith entire subway and bus lines scribbled out with a black line, \nmarked with LOL, and Dont even. Across the region, mile-long \nlines of people stand for an hour or more, freezing in bitter winds, \nwaiting for shuttle buses that are supposed to replace the trains and \ntrolleys. Some have given up and walked home.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFor workers paid by the hour, the impossibility of getting to work \nmeans disaster, especially since high housing prices have pushed poor \npeople out of the city to outlying communities like Brockton, \nLawrence and beyond. When I commiserated with a checkout clerk at my \ngrocery store yesterday  hes been missing work when the buses break \ndown or just dont come  thinly veiled panic showed in his eyes. \nPeople will be losing their houses, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tEven if you have a car, you cant rely on it. Not everyone is \nspending the hours needed to dig it out, over and over again. Driving \nis a game of blind chicken, because the intersections are blocked by \n12-foot mounds of plowed snow.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAll roads are narrowed by plowed snow walls and snowed-under cars \nand deep slush that just cant get cleared fast enough. And once a \ncar turns into a putatively two-way street thats now just one lane, \nwhos going to back up into traffic to let the other through? Once \nyou arrive, where do you park?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThink about how annoying it is when one or two of your usual routes \nis temporarily shut down. Thats happened to every street here  with \nno end in sight. \tCar insurance companies are swamped with accident \ncalls. Walking is treacherous: The Massachusetts Avenue Bridge over \nthe Charles River, a major pedestrian artery that links Boston and \nCambridge, is still inches deep with snow, but you cant reach the \nrailings because they are lined with snowbanks plowed in from earlier \nblizzards.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWorking parents are desperate: When classes were canceled, they had \nto stay home, leave their kids alone or scramble to find child care. \nEven when the schools are open, many parents cant work a full day: \nYou drop off the child, spend two hours driving to work and have to \nleave early to get the child before after-school programs close.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome years ago I did a lot of reading on ice ages. It was \nsurprising how little it takes to start the cycle, and it all has to \ndo with snow...\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut everybody is desperate. Were all having to spend time and \nmoney we dont have on plowing, car and house repairs, and heating \nbecause of the record-low temperatures. People who survive by holding \ndown additional part-time jobs have had to skip those extra shifts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBusinesses have been hammered: Whos going out to eat, shop or see \na movie? How can businesses manufacture and deliver products or \narrange deals if their workers just cant show up? Some companies can \nlet people work from home occasionally, but not every day for a \nmonth. Snow-removal services, roofers, chiropractors, and auto \nmechanics and body shops will profit  but that cant possibly make \nup for what is drained from nearly every other business and household.\u0014\n \u0014\n\tAnd its devastating for state and local governments. The City of \nBoston has spent $35 million on snow removal, more than twice what it \nhad budgeted. That doesnt include Cambridge or any of the \nsurrounding towns, or the state. It doesnt include how much it will \ncost to repair the devastated roads, sidewalks and bridges that will \nhave been worn away by snow, freezing, salt and rust. Incoming tax \nrevenues will fall because business and personal incomes are down. \nThe state government expects to see a drop of $30 million in the next \nmonths.\u0014\n \u0014\n\tSure, its not the same as an earthquake: The snow will melt, \neventually. But that will bring more woes. The flooding will hurt the \nT, ruin roofs and basements and clog roads still more.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhere are the federal disaster funds, the presidential visit, \nAnderson Cooper interviewing victims, volunteers flying in, goods and \nservices donated after hurricanes and tornadoes? The pictures may be \npretty. But we need help, now. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIts snowing as I write this. Were expecting more, along with \nfreezing rain, this weekend. And the misery wont end even when it \nall melts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tE. J. Graff is a senior fellow at the Schuster Institute for \nInvestigative Journalism at Brandeis University. \u0014\n\tA version of this op-ed appears in print on February 20, 2015, on \npage A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Bostons Winter \nFrom Hell.\u0014",

    "title": "BIBLE IDOLATRY",
    "words": "Mike Slaughter. Ministry Matters   3/6/15\u0014\n\u0014\nI recently blogged about the heresy of the nation-state, one of three \nheresies addressed in Renegade Gospel: The Rebel Jesus. Our \ncommitment to Jesus must always supersede our commitment to Caesar! \nYet, the nation-state is not the only heresy that waylays some along \nthe radical road to the cross. Many within the church have also begun \nto practice Bible idolatry, acting as if the written word were the \nhighest authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow please dont misunderstand me. The Bible, to which I dedicate the \nfirst moments of each day, is the most important book in the world. \nBut, when Jesus left he didnt say he would leave us with a book, but \nwith his presence in the form of the Holy Spirit. But when he, the \nSpirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will \nnot speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will \ntell you what is yet to come (John 16:13). In interpreting this holy \nbook, I need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and collective wisdom of \nthe community of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the ages and continuing today, the church has used the \nwritten word as an excuse or justification for not obeying the \ndirectives of Jesus. The written word has been deployed to justify \nwar, slavery, genocide, racism, sexism and a whole host of other \nisms that do not reflect Kingdom values. I believe we are to commit \nour all, our whole being, to the directive of the Logos, the Living \nWord, but we are not to subjugate the Logos to the written word.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus himself made it clear that he superseded the written word. Look \nat Matthew 5. At six points in this chapter, Jesus quoted the books \nof Moses or other parts of the Torah, and then he changed them. He \ndid this in reference to murder, adultery, divorce, solemn pledges, \nretribution and love. Jesus began each section with the words You \nhave heard that it was said, then followed with But I say to \nyou.... Lets look more carefully at one example.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew 5:38, Jesus said, You have heard that it was said, Eye \nfor eye and tooth for tooth.' This expression appears in the Old \nTestament in Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, and Deuteronomy 19:21. \nLets place this law in a contemporary setting. Ginghamsburg Church \nis just north of Dayton, Ohio, a city once known as a thriving center \nfor the tool and die industry. Through the years many Ginghamsburg \nmembers have made their living as machinists in local shops. Lets \nsay that one of those members was hurt because of defective \nmachineryperhaps a hand was crushed. Based on the law of eye for \neye and tooth for tooth, worker compensation would take the form of \nthe machine shop owners hand, or foremans hand, being crushed as \nwell a just retribution. But Jesus said that that type of \nretribution was not Gods intention. Jesus, noting that his authority \nsuperseded the authority of the written word, told his followers, If \nanyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek \nalso (Matthew 5:39). If we make the written word, the Bible, our \nhighest authority, then much of the world would become toothless and \nblind!\u0014\n\u0014\nI find much in the Old Testament that does not seem to align with the \nteachings of Jesus, especially those passages in which God commands \nbiblical heroes to destroy entire communities, killing all men, women \nand even children. When I encounter those difficult passages, I \nreturn to the red letters, the words of Jesus found in the New \nTestament, and then reread the troublesome passages through the lens \nof Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever I teach on this subject, someone inevitably will ask me, \nBut doesnt the New Testament say that the word of God endures \nforever? In response, lets take a closer look at 1 Peter 1:23, the \npassage theyre referring to: For you have been born again, not of \nperishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring \nword of God. This is another example in which the English \ntranslation is inadequate to express the original Greek text. The \nword referred to as living and enduring in the latter part of the \nverse is Logos in the Greeka direct reference to Jesus as the Living \nWord, not to the Bible as the written word. The Logos of God endures \nforever. When Jesus returns and the perfect comes, we will not need \nthe Scriptures any longer. They are all truly fulfilled and perfected \nin Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nMother Teresa once gave a pastor acquaintance of mine some of the \nbest preaching advice I have ever heard. My friend was traveling \nthrough India and on a whim decided to visit the Missionaries of \nCharity headquarters, where he was surprised to meet the tiny yet \nindefatigable Mother Teresa in person. He asked her, What advice \nmight you have to offer a young preacher? Her response: Preach \nJesus, the true Jesus, the real Jesus, the resurrected Jesus, and not \na Jesus of peoples imaginations. As Christ followers, all of us \nthis Lenten season must commit ourselves to realigning our lifestyles \nwith the renegade gospel of the real and rebel Jesus.\u0014",

    "words": "BEST DERBY EVER?\u0014\nBy Bill Finley, special to ESPN\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen was the last time a group this good lined up to\u0014\nstart in the Kentucky Derby? Think about it. Twenty\u0014\nyears ago? Forty years ago? Never?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe usual refrain around this time of year is the\u0014\ncurrent 3-year-old crop is not a strong one. It's not that\u0014\nwe have any real evidence to base that on. We just like\u0014\nto say it. But no one is saying it this time around, and if\u0014\nthey did, they'd have to be either be crazy or ignorant\u0014\nor a combination of both. This year's Kentucky Derby\u0014\nfigures to be quite the treat as the group of horses\u0014\nabout to assemble in Louisville is nothing short of\u0014\nphenomenal.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt starts with American Pharoah. With any of these\u0014\nhorses it's too early to tell just how good they are or\u0014\nwhether they will live up to the hype. But, then again,\u0014\nthere's every chance he could be one of the greatest\u0014\nhorses of our times. He reminds you of Seattle Slew.\u0014\nIt's more than he beats his competition. He just flat out\u0014\noutruns them, flaunting his superiority every step of the\u0014\nway.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe'll be the Kentucky Derby favorite. In 19 years out\u0014\nof 20 it would be his stablemate, Dortmund, who\u0014\nwould be the chalk. He's never lost in six career starts,\u0014\nran away and hid from his opposition in the Santa Anita\u0014\nDerby and has twice beat an exceptional horse in Firing\u0014\nLine.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan you find a fault in Carpe Diem? I can't. He is so\u0014\nwell bred he cost $1.6 million at the yearling sales and\u0014\nhas looked like he's worth ten times that much this\u0014\nyear at the races. He dominated in the Tampa Bay\u0014\nDerby and the Blue Grass Stakes. He's quality through\u0014\nand through. Like Dortmund, in any other year he\u0014\nwould be a solid Kentucky Derby favorite.\u0014\nIs Materiality a freak? Based on what he did at\u0014\nGulfstream, winning the Florida Derby in just his third\u0014\nlifetime start, he very well could be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese four horses will likely make up the four betting\u0014\nfavorites in the race and their record is a combined 17\u0014\nfor 19.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd let's not forget about the UAE Derby winner\u0014\nMubtaahij. That race has never produced a serious\u0014\nKentucky Derby contender, but this is a very different story.\u0014\nNow that that the race is back on dirt he proved that he's more than \na synthetic\u0014\nsensation and he obliterated the field he faced in Dubai.\u0014\nPlus, he's trained by one of the most able men in the\u0014\nbusiness in Mike De Kock, and is exceptionally wellbred\u0014\nhimself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe group is so good that no one is talking about a\u0014\nhorse like International Star, who won all three of the\u0014\nmajor preps in Louisiana this year, or Frosted, another\u0014\nexceptionally well-bred horse that just happened to win\u0014\nthe Wood Memorial.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether or not this is actually one of the best Derby\u0014\nfields ever won't be determined for some time. We\u0014\nhave to see how these horses do down the road. If too\u0014\nmany fizzle out, this class won't look nearly as\u0014\nglamorous. But I seriously doubt that's going to\u0014\nhappen.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to the best Derby fields in modern\u0014\ntimes here are a handful that comes to mind:\u0014\n\u0014\n1973:\u0014\nThe presence of Secretariat alone makes this among\u0014\nthe greatest Derby fields ever. Sham, of course, was a\u0014\nterrific horse, who might have won the Triple Crown if\u0014\nnot for the fact he was born the same year as\u0014\nSecretariat. The field also included Hall of Famer\u0014\nForego, but he wasn't Forego at the time. He had had\u0014\njust seven starts and was just an allowance winner at\u0014\nthe time.\u0014\n\u0014\n1978: You not only had a Triple Crown winner in\u0014\nAffirmed and a fellow Hall of Famer in Alydar, but also\u0014\nBelieve It and Sensitive Prince. Believe It was a stalwart\u0014\nout of the Woody Stephens barn and Sensitive Prince\u0014\ncame into the race at 6-for-6 for Allen Jerkens.\u0014\n\u0014\n1988: Winning Colors remains the last filly to win the\u0014\nKentucky Derby. Runner-up Forty Niner was a fantastic\u0014\nhorse. Risen Star finished third and was probably the\u0014\nbest of that group. Seeking the Gold finished seventh,\u0014\nbut went on to make $2.3 million.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAs things stand now, I'll take the class of 2015 over\u0014\nany of them.\u0014",

    "title": "BILLY GRAHAM: AMERICA'S PASTOR",
    "words": "Martin Marty\u0014\nApril 13, 2015  \u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Graham and the Shaping of a Nation is the subtitle of the book, \nAmericas Pastor, an acclaimed sort-of-biography by acclaim-worthy \nDuke University historian Grant Wacker. Last weekend Wacker discussed \nhis book at the Cushwa Center of the University of Notre Dame with a \ncrowded, hall-full of historians of American Christianity who have \nbeen invited to enjoy the hospitality of that Center for now three \ndecades.\u0014\n\u0014\nWackers book was critiqued by Richard Bushman, expert on Mormonism \nand much more, and Christian Smith, a sociologist who strains beyond \nthe disciplinary confines of his field. Both were laudatory, and, \nafter three hours of my note-taking, I find that I (almost) never \nheard a disparaging word, though questions were apt and expertly \nhandled by the panel of three.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome seasons ago we historians enjoyed a dry-run or preview of the \nbook at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois, the \nevangelists alma mater. There and then many participants talked \nabout how their students, even at evangelical-rooted colleges \n(including Wheaton), have a hard time locating and relating to much \nof Grahamism. \u0014\n\u0014\nGraham, now far into his nineties and afflicted by Parkinsons \ndisease, cannot participate in book-related events, but, humble \nthough he isaccording to all accounts which were heard at Notre \nDamehe could take justifiable pride in the record of his \nachievements as Americas Pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not a review of the rich, 400-paged, hyper-indexed Wacker \nbook, but an attempt in a brief space to locate him. The author is by \nno means uncritical, but he did not need to blame or praise Graham, \nwhose stature and record among Americas religious leaders have been \nmuch appraised and appreciated. (The more critical assessments from \nearly in the evangelists career are remembered, but are not focal or \nnewsworthy any more.) \u0014\n\u0014\nWacker told us of letters to Graham in his prime, delivered weekly by \nthe semi-truck full, or when Madison Square Garden was overflowing \nnightly during the 1957 Crusade. Certainly, no other Christian \nfigure has been heard by as many people and potential converts as has \nGraham, who led rallies in ninety nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe friend of U.S. Presidents, the intentionally non-political \npreacher was inevitably drawn into politics, and is remembered there \nfor a mixed record, e.g. in the social justice areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow: how would I frame him? More and more I would locate his years as \none episode in the long career of episodic American religious \nphenomena. At Notre Dame no one could come up with the name of a true \npotential successor, and most agreed that his legacy is mixed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut they also saw Graham as a leader in a revival that came and went.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn its peak years foes and friends alike planned strategies in light \nof where Grahamism might go. Some thought his version of Christian \ngathering and activity was becoming and would remain normative. But \nthat was in the 1950s, and the episode was replaced during the fabled \n1960s and ever since. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs implied here, Graham once belonged to the public, but now he \nbelongs to the historians and sociologists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat should surprise no one and does not detract from his legacy. It \nmerely shows that the moment and movement that he enjoyed and \nfashioned, or which in many ways fashioned him is now past, thanks to \ncultural shifts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral commentators, led by Wacker, stressed that changes in family \nstructure and ethos during and after the 1960s helped form our \ncurrent episode with its declining religious participation and \nfavor, and with its polarization in theology, politics, and practice. \nAll of these changes make it hard to conceive of any forthcoming \nAmericas Pastor or a flock for one.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat does not mean that religion as such will fade and its record \nwill only show decline. But it calls for new assessments, \nstrategies, and for the religious, new resourcing in the reservoirs \nof hopewhich, in his episodeGraham drew upon and, remarkably, fed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources:\u0014\n\u0014\nWacker, Grant.

    "words": "Bipolar Disorder Signs and Symptoms\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides the manic and depressive episodes, there are other things \nthat can be indicators of bipolar disorder. These additional features \ninclude:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAnxiety  Feeling very anxious, tense, or restless for no \nparticular reason can be a symptom of bipolar disorder. It can also \ncause trouble concentrating, worrying, irrational fear of something \nbad happening, or the feeling that you are losing control of your own \nactions. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tGeneral melancholy  Bipolar disorder can cause you to feel a loss \nof pleasure in most or all activities that will persist even when \ngood things happen in your life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tMixed or atypical features  Sometimes individuals with bipolar \ndisorder exhibit symptoms that dont go along with the normal \nsymptoms of the disease. For example, you might exhibit symptoms for \nboth a manic episode and a depressive episode at the same time. Or \nyou could be having a depressive episode but still have an improved \nmood when something good happens. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPsychosis  In severe cases, manic or depressive episodes can \nresult in detachment from reality. This can include delusions and \nhallucinations. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRapid cycling  If you experience at least four rapid mood swing \nepisodes during the period of one year, with full or partial \nremission of symptoms in-between, this is a indicative of bipolar \ndisorder. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tCatatonia  Bipolar disorder can sometimes cause individuals to \nproduce no response to the environment around them. This can also \ninclude holding your body in a strange position, refusing to speak, \nor mimicking the way another person speaks or moves. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSeasonal pattern  Sometimes the episodes associated with bipolar \ndisorder can be correlative with the seasons of weather, meaning that \nyou can produce different symptoms depending on your surroundings. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPeripartum onset  Occasionally, bipolar disorder symptoms can \npresent themselves during pregnancy or during the first month after \ndelivery.\u0014",

    "title": "BUSH:BOOK REVIEW OF GEORGE W. BUSH PRESIDENCY",
    "words": "Book review: 'Bush'\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted: Saturday, July 16, 2016 10:30 pm \u0014\n\u0014\nBook review (nonfiction): 'Bush' Associated Press | \u0014\n\u0014\nThe successes of George W. Bush's two terms as president were vastly \novershadowed by the invasion of Iraq, a horrendous decision that \nsprang from gut instinct and defied reasoned analysis, an acclaimed \nhistorian concludes in a comprehensive biography that pulls no \npunches.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn what Jean Edward Smith calls a blunder of historic proportions, \nBush took down Saddam Hussein in a war predicated on baseless claims \nthat he was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction and then \ncompounded the error by attempting to bring Western-style democracy \nto Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether George W. Bush was the worst president in American history \nwill be long debated, the author concludes, but his decision to \ninvade Iraq is easily the worst foreign policy decision ever made by \nan American president.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 43rd president took office when the nation enjoyed a budget \nsurplus, low unemployment and a decade in which no Americans had been \nkilled in combat. When he left office, the economy was in shambles \nand the nation was enmeshed in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nBush was ill-prepared for the complexities of being president and had \nscant experience and little interest in foreign affairs, the author \nasserts. Yet he prided himself on his decisiveness, most notably in \nhis response to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. He strutted around like \na cowboy and then picked a fight with Iraq, Smith writes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaintaining that Bush's most critical decisions were his and his \nalone, the book brushes aside any suggestions that key administration \nfigures, such as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, \nprodded the president toward war. More of a factor was Bush's \nborn-again religious faith that reinforced a world view that defined \ngeopolitics in terms of good and evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving he was the agent of God's will, and acting with divine \nguidance, George W. Bush would lead the nation into two disastrous \nwars of aggression, Smith writes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biographer is more charitable to his subject when it comes to \ndomestic issues. Although faulting Bush for tax cuts whose main \nbeneficiaries were the wealthy, the book applauds his education \nreform initiatives that broke with Republican orthodoxy and \nexemplified the compassionate conservatism he promoted. The \npresident's fruitless push for comprehensive immigration reform and \nhis success in shepherding legislation to ease the financial crisis \nthrough a skeptical Congress also draw praise.\u0014\nAmid all the criticism, including the dilatory response to Hurricane \nKatrina, Smith is most effusive in support of Bush's commitment to \nlead the global fight against AIDS, an often overlooked achievement \nof his presidency. The billions of dollars earmarked for drugs to \nAfrica stands as the world's largest health initiative to target a \nsingle disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book draws on Bush's public papers as well as memoirs of \nadministration officials and other key figures from the period. Smith \nsaid Bush refused to be interviewed for the book because Smith had \nwritten a book that was highly critical of George H.W. Bush's \ndecision to launch the first Gulf War.\u0014\nSmith ranks among the most eminent of today's American biographers, \nhaving written critically acclaimed books on Dwight Eisenhower, \nFranklin D. Roosevelt, Ulysses S. Grant and John Marshall, among \nothers. Although his latest work excoriates Bush for the Iraq \ninvasion, the author credits his efforts in other spheres and \npresents a fair, comprehensive and highly readable account of a \ncritical period that is sure to be reassessed by historians over the \ncoming decades.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\ 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\u0014\n-----------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nEditorial: Bush's faith created catastrophe\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Republican National Convention has convened in Cleveland. Jean \nEdward Smiths Bush begins with a wallop more forceful than an \nopening gavel. Rarely in the history of the United States has the \nnation been so ill-served as during the presidency of George W. \nBush, the first sentence of the biography of the 43rd president \nsays. Sundays Books & Authors section reviewed the magisterial \nvolume. The author, an acclaimed historian, calls the invasion of \nIraq the worst foreign policy decision ever made by a U.S. president. \nThe Times-Dispatch agrees. Sixteen years ago in Philadelphia, \nRepublicans nominated Bush. Conventions matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith gives Bush credit for various initiatives but the errors \nregarding the invasion overwhelm even the most enlightened programs, \nsuch as the campaign against AIDS in Africa. Iraq not only involved \nthe . in a quagmire; it also contributed to economic distress. Its \nconsequences will exact a toll for many years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\t\tThe broader implications relate to religions role in politics. \nBush, Smith makes clear, acted in Iraq not because he was a tool of \nDick Cheney and other vulcans in the administration but because he \nconsidered himself an agent of God. The invasion was Gods will; Bush \nacted as Gods chosen one. Prior to becoming president, Bush had no \nexperience in foreign policy. He did not appear to have any interest \nin it, either. He lacked curiosity about the broader world. Although \nreligion facilitated his personal redemption and saved him from a \nlife of dissipation, faith, or at least his version of it, led him to \ncommit grievous errors.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe saw the world as black and white, right and wrong. Religion \nencourages humility yet in Bush it promoted  as it promotes in \nothers  a certainty unsuited to a world conceived in sin. Bush \ngoverned with a swagger absent from Abraham Lincoln and Franklin \nRoosevelt, the two greatest commanders in chief. They led the nation \nduring desperate wars but did not presume to unfold the great mystery \nof the incarnation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe religious right rallied to Bush. His failure has not inspired \nself-exploration. Jerry Falwell Jr.s endorsement of Donald Trump \ninsults the flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso on Sunday, the Faith & Values column included a submission by \nWilliam Mims, a regular contributor. A justice on the Supreme Court \nof Virginia and a former Republican member of the General Assembly, \nMims wrote that he turned to the Bible as he contemplated events in \nDallas, Baton Rouge and Minneapolis.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have read the Bible enough to realize that Jesus teachings are \nnot a manifesto for governing, he explained. Other than the \ninstruction to render under Caesar that which is Caesars, there is \nhardly a mention of specific governing principles. Rather, Jesus \nspoke of the transformation of individuals. Yet in those \ntransformational teachings, could I find general principles that \nwould indeed provide guidance  and, yes, comfort  during stormy \ntimes in the public realm?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, he discovered, yes. He cited the gift of empathy, a topic he has \naddressed with eloquence before. We must love one another, the Bible \nsays. Grace is granted, not earned. All political roads lead to Rome, \nspiritual roads to Emmaus. The religious right has taken a detour.\u0014\n\u0014\nBush says he does not do nuance. When believers recite the Creed, \nthey assert absolutes, but in a fallen world faith relies on \nambiguities. Jesus told his disciples that he taught in parables \nbecause the people would not understand him otherwise. Even the \ndisciples missed the point from time to time. Faith ought to make \npoliticians cautious, not confident. A chip on the shoulder does not \nbecome the religious right or left\u0014\n.\u0014\nSmith has composed a cautionary tale. Mims has recorded what the \nangels sing. The biography and the column belong on the bedside \ntables of delegates assembled this week.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tPosted in \tOUR OPINION, View-editorial on Monday, July 18, 2016 \n10:30 pm.

    "title": "BLACKS MUST SOLVE BLACK PROBLEMS",
    "words": "Monday, July 18, 2016  \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Walter E. Williams \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prospects for a better future are nearly hopeless for roughly 20 \npercent of black people  those who reside in big-city crime-infested \nand dysfunctional neighborhoods. There is virtually nothing that can \nbe done about it without a major rebuilding of the black community \nfrom within. Lets examine some of the aspects of the problem and the \ndismal prognosis, given the status quo.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most important social unit is the family. Many talk about the \nbreakdown in the black family when a far more accurate \ndescription is that the family doesnt form in the first place. About \n73 percent of black babies are born to unwed mothers. By the way, \nthat percentage was 25 in 1963 and 11 in 1938. The absence of fathers \nis crucial. Even President Barack Obama recognized this when he said \nthat children who grow up without a father are five times more \nlikely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to \ndrop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. \nFemale-headed households are a devastating problem, but the solution \nlies almost exclusively within the black community. Its a massive \njob for black churches and social organizations. If there is a role \nfor government to play, its to stop subsidizing such behavior with \nhandouts.\u0014\n\u0014\nEducation and skills acquisition are vital to upward mobility. But \nwhat goes on in many predominantly black schools is no less than a \nbetrayal to those blacks and whites who sacrificed their blood, sweat \nand tears during the civil rights struggle of the 1940s, 50s and \n60s in an effort to secure better educational opportunities. \nNationally, an average of 1,175 teachers and staff were physically \nattacked each day of the 2011-12 school year. Most of this occurred \nat predominantly black schools. In Baltimore, each school day in \n2010, an average of four teachers and staff were assaulted. Some \nChicago teachers are treated for post-traumatic stress. Given this \nclimate of fear, intimidation and disorderliness, one should not be \nsurprised by an outcome that shows that the average black student who \nmanages to graduate from high school has an academic achievement \nlevel of a white seventh- or eighth-grader.\u0014\n\u0014\nI do not believe that the disgraceful academic performance by black \nstudents is preordained. In other words, it just doesnt have to be \nthat way. The first order of business for education to occur is the \nprovision of an orderly, safe teaching and learning environment. The \neducation establishment and civil authorities have ignored their \nresponsibility  or have been thwarted in their efforts  to create \nsuch an environment. Rather than watch future generations of black \npeople have their educational opportunities destroyed, black people \nwho really care need to act. They can readily discover the miscreants \nand use whatever methods at their disposal to stop them from making \neducation impossible for others. The bottom line is that if civil \nauthorities will not act to ensure a safe and orderly learning \nenvironment, there is no reason for black people to accept such \ninability and its results.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeres an experiment. Meet with black people such as Reps. John \nConyers (age 87), Charles Rangel (86), Eddie Bernice Johnson (80), \nAlcee Hastings (79) and Maxine Waters (77). Ask them whether their \nparents would have tolerated their assaulting and cursing teachers or \nany other adult. I bet you the rent money that their parents  or any \nother parents they knew when they were growing up  would not have \naccepted the grossly disrespectful behavior seen today among many \nblack youngsters, using foul language and racial epithets. Older \nblacks will tell you that had they behaved that way, they would have \nfelt serious pain in their hind parts. If blacks of past generations \nwould not accept such self-destructive behavior, why should todays \nblacks accept it?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bottom line is that only black people can solve our problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason \nUniversity.\u0014",

    "title": "BIRMINGHAM CHURCH BOMBER DENIED PAROLE",
    "words": "Birmingham 16th Street Baptist Church bomber denied parole\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Steve Visser and Leigh Waldman, CNN\u0014\nUpdated 11:21 AM ET, Wed August 3, 2016 \u0014\n\u0014\n(CNN)    The last living convicted bomber in one of the most \nnotorious terrorist attacks in American history has been denied \nparole.\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Ku Klux Klan member Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. avoided justice \nfor 38 years in the deaths of four girls in Birmingham's 16th Street \nBaptist Church on September 15, 1963, before being convicted in 2001. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 86-year-old Blanton had asked the Alabama Board of Pardons and \nParoles to let him die as a free man, but the panel denied his \nrequest Wednesday morning. He won't be eligible again until 2021, the \npanel decided. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlanton was convicted in 2001 of murdering Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia \nWesley, Carole Robertson, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11, and \nsentenced to life in prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe powerful bomb was planted under the church steps and it collapsed \na basement wall into a lounge the four girls used for changing into \ntheir choir robes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe former U.S. attorney who convicted him, Doug Jones, opposed the \nparole request. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fact of the matter is he bombed a house of God on Sunday morning and \nkilled four children and needs to do the time for his crimes,\" Jones \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2008, during an interview on NPR, Chris McNair recalled seeing his \ndaughter's body on the day that shocked the nation. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We drove over to a hospital, and we fumbled around, and we found \nsomebody else who had been in the morgue,\" he told reporter Michele \nNorris. \"And there lay all four of them, there side by side on the \ntable. And Denise was lying out there with a piece of mortar, it \nlooked like a rock, mashed in her head.\" \u0014\nJustice was delayed not because the case was a bona fide mystery. \nWithin days, the FBI suspected that Blanton and his KKK cohorts \nRobert Edward Chamblis, Bobby Frank Cherry and Herman Frank Cash were \nresponsible for the attack after civil rights protests and other \nbombings had rocked the city nicknamed \"Bombingham.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAlabama Attorney General Bill Baxley convicted the then-73-year-old \nChambliss in 1977, after reopening the case in 1971, and then the \ncase remained dormant for decades. \u0014\n\u0014\nBaxley contended that the FBI, which had informants in the Klan in \nthe 1960s and wiretaps on klansmen, wouldn't share the information \nthat would allow him to build a case against Blanton, Cherry and \nCash. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in 1997, after other successful prosecutions for Civil Rights \nEra murders, the FBI Birmingham office reopened the case. Jones, the \nU.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama during the Clinton \nadministration, made it a personal crusade. \u0014\n\u0014\nChamblis and Cherry, who was convicted in 2002, died in prison. Cash, \nwho died in 1994, was never charged in the case. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Klan targeted the church because it was a leading \nAfrican-American institution and served as a staging spot for the \nmarches that met fierce resistance from city Commissioner of Public \nSafety Bull Connor, brutality that has lived on in television footage \nand defines the city for many people to this day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Klan hoped the attacks would derail the movement -- the marches \nhad wrung concessions from local leaders and the state had begun \nintegrating schools days before the bombing -- but historians contend \nthe church bombing marked a turning point in the civil rights \nmovement and contributed to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlanton is held in the St. Clair Correctional Facility near \nBirmingham, where he is serving four back-to-back life sentences. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlabama allows a convict to be considered for parole after 10 years \nor after serving one-third of his sentence, whichever comes first, \naccording to the parole board website. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is unknown if Blanton had an attorney representing him for \nWednesday's parole board hearing. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlanton has never shown remorse or accepted responsibility for \nkilling children, which alone should have disqualified him for \nparole, Jones said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Would we let a terrorist out after 15 years? I don't think so,\" he \nsaid before the panel's decision. \"That's the issue. The law says he \ngets punished for it. That's what should happen.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTISTS AND CHRISTMAS",
    "words": "BAPTISTS AND CHRISTMAS\u0014\nby Bruce T. Gourley\u0014\n\u0014\nThis month most Baptist congregations will do something relatively \ninnovative in the annals of Baptist history: celebrate Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nEaton Hopewell Academy in Rhode Island, founded in 1756, was the \nfirst Baptist educational institution in America and the forerunner \nof Brown University. Christmas break was not on the school calendar. \nQuite the opposite, in fact.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Jones, a student at the academy, maintained a diary. On \nDecember 25, 1757 he wrote: Christmas Day! But our school goes on as \nusual. The only difference was that we had two big turkeys for \ndinner. Mr. E(aton) told us that he did not observe Christmas as he \nwas certain that our Savior was not born on the twenty-fifth or any \nother day in December.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith very few exceptions, Baptist churches, too, treated Christmas as \nany other day of the year. Even when Christmas fell on Sunday in a \ngiven year, recognition of the holiday rarely occurred. For Baptists \nand most Protestants alike, the pagan origins of Christmas were \nsimply too off-putting.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorically, various ancient cultures celebrated the shortest days \nof winter with festivals often associated with pagan mythology and \naccompanied by drinking, merriment and other frivolous activity. Amid \nthe annual revelry, the Roman Catholic Church in the fourth century \ndecided that Jesus birth should be formally celebrated. As the Bible \nprovided no indication of Jesus birth date, Pope Julius I chose \nDecember 25 in an effort to Christianize pagan winter celebrations. \nSoon, a tradition of fasting on the days prior to Christmas \n(eventually known as Advent) developed to counter the debauchery \noften associated with the season.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Churchs efforts yielded mixed results. December remained a month \nof revelry more than righteousness.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, some Christians came to revere Nicholas, a fourth century \nbishop from Eastern Christendom legendary for his generosity, \nespecially to children. Eventually in some countries a day of gift \ngiving and generosity was established in honor of Nicholas. December \n6 in Western Christendom and December 19 in Eastern Christendom \nbecame St. Nicholas Day. Still later, some European immigrants \nbrought to the New World their reverence for the ancient, gift-giving \nbishop.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe celebratory nature of pagan festivals, Roman Catholic calendar of \nChristmas, and remembrance of Nicholas generosity to children \neventually converged. In the early 1800s more Americans gradually \ncelebrated Christmas day with lively recreation, special foods, and \ngifts to children. Roman Catholics and some Protestants reflected on \nthe birth of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the difficult days of the American Civil War, illustrator \nThomas Nast sketched dozens of Christmas drawings for Harpers \nWeekly, including depictions of a jolly, gift-giving Santa Claus (a \nname of Dutch origins with roots in St. Nicholas) that soon became \ningrained in popular imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1870 the twenty-fifth day of December, commonly called Christmas \nDay, was set aside by President Ulysses S. Grant as a day of public \nfast or thanksgiving. No religious significance was attached to the \nholiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe establishment of Christmas as a federal, secular holiday \nironically paved the way for many Protestants to recognize Christmas \nas a Christian holiday. In the 1880s a number of Baptist churches \nacross America began observing the holiday with Christmas sermons and \nhymns. Some Baptist womans groups, capitalizing on the giving theme \nof the holiday, began collecting Christmas offerings for foreign \nmissions.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new congregational tradition had begun. Over one hundred years \nlater, many Baptist churches also gradually embraced Advent in the \nweeks leading up to Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the late twentieth century the spiritual celebration of Christmas \nhad become so well established in Protestant churches that many, \nBaptists included, began taking offense to a growing detachment of \nreligion from Christmas in much of society and culture. Forgetful \nthat their own faith traditions had historically refused to recognize \nChristmas as a holy day, many critics each December ironically \ncomplain that Christ has been taken out of Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians in America today choose (at least in part) to \ncelebrate Christmas in a religious sense, with many also observing \nAdvent. Many Baptist congregations choose to celebrate the Christmas \nseason as a remembrance of Christs coming into the world. This \nDecember churches will have Christmas parties, sing Christmas hymns, \nobserve a season of Advent, and reflect on the birth of Christ. \nCongregations will celebrate together in unity as congregants search \ntheir own hearts in quiet moments.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist has come. He is with us. Peace and hope mark his presence in \nour lives. We rejoice that Christ is transforming us and the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet we know the reconciliation of humanity and the world to God is \nfar from complete. Too many persons have no hope, too little peace \ncharacterizes our world. We acknowledge the need for further \ntransformation in our lives, the lives of others, and the whole of \nour planet. The journey continues.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so this Christmas season we embrace Christ as ever arriving \nwithin and around us.

    "title": "BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS",
    "words": "READING THE BIBLE TODAY: Blessed are the Peacemakers  Matthew 5:9\u0014\nby Mark E. Biddle\u0014\n\u0014\nMark E. Biddle, Dr.Theol (Zrich), is Russell T. Cherry Professor of \nOld Testament at Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond. He has \nauthored six books, ten translations, and more than 150 articles, \nreviews, and lectures. He is editor of R&E, and of the Reading the \nOld Testament (Smyth & Helwys) and the Smyth & Helwys commentaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace  Jeremiah 8:11.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus began the Sermon on the Mount with nine Beatitudes that \nreaders often unfortunately reduce to platitudes. The seventh, \nBlessed are the peacemakers, for example, can sound like a call to \npassivity and placidity: Blessed are those who accept life with \nserenity, remaining calm, preserving calm, spreading calm. Both the \ncontext and a careful examination of the central term peacemaker \nsuggest, however, that such an understanding misapprehends the \nfundamental thrust of Jesus teaching. The peacemaker beatitude \nmarks a shift in the beatitudes from a focus on the blessed attitudes \nthat characterize citizens in the Kingdom of God (poverty of spirit, \nteachability/meekness, purity of heart, etc.) to an emphasis on \nbehavioral expressions of these attitudes, expressions that will \nlikely and ironically elicit persecution (mentioned three times in \nvv 10-12). Placidity does not elicit persecution. Jesus did not say, \nBlessed are the peaceful. More to the point, it is easy to read \nMatt 5:9 and allow the concept of peace itself to misdirect ones \nattention away from the active force of the term peacemaker.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, on Jesus lips even the term peace implies much more \nthan passivity and placidity. Jesus very likely spoke the beatitudes \nin Hebrew or, even more likely, in closely-related Aramaic. The \nHebrew/Aramaic term translated peace ??? refers, primarily, not to \nthe absence of strife, as the English term peace often implies. \nInstead, it denotes a condition of wholeness, wellness, and balance: \nthings as they should be. Many relationships not characterized by \nopen strife nonetheless fall far short of wholeness, wellness, and \nbalance. Jesus peace is not a negative condition (absence of war), \nbut a positive condition of well-being.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, Jesus pronounced blessed those who recognize when \nthings are not as they should be and undertake active measures to \nmake peace in these situations. Jesus did not bless the kind of \npeace-keeping efforts that merely intervene between warring parties \nto separate them, preventing open hostility. Such efforts may produce \n(temporary) absence of war, but they rarely result in well-being. \nJesus blessed those who intervene to bring reconciliation and \nrestoration.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntervening in situations to make peace is risky and dangerous. One \nor more parties may not welcome the intervention, especially not the \nparty most responsible for the lack of peace, the party that will be \nrequired to change most. Peacemaking may evoke persecution. The \nministry of the Prince of Peace led to the cross. Yet, since the Son \nof God came to make peace, the children of God manifest their kinship \nwhen they, too, seek to make peace  even if it costs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point, a Baptist theologian/preacher might normally \nextrapolate from Jesus beatitude a call for the church to identify \ninstances in the world in which there is no peace and to engage \nactively in peacemaking: poverty, hatred, racial discord, injustice \nof all kinds, etc. Kairos-time of now has revealed the fissures that \nfracture American society. It has also revealed that these fissures \nrun deep even in the church. Might it be that, before the church can \neffectively make peace in the greater world, it must address internal \ndisharmony?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, through a former student, I know of a local congregation \nin danger of open hostility compounded by the good services of social \nmedia. During, and after, the recent presidential campaign, church \nmembers  deacons and Sunday School teachers  divided into partisan \ncamps and launched verbal assaults on one another via Facebook. On \nSunday, they worshiped together in an atmosphere of passive \naggression. The ministerial staff knows about the situation (many of \nthem utilize social media, too, after all) and has discussed it. In \nthe end, however, the staff has concluded that it would threaten \npeace to address the partisan hostility lying just under the \nsurface of Sunday mornings passivity  they have opted to preserve \npeace where there is no peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, the issues dividing even the church come with potent \nemotional force: reproductive ethics, sexual ethics, race relations, \nand economic justice top the list. All of them are powder kegs. Many \nof them seem to resist black-and-white analysis. The staff of the \nexample church rightly senses that making peace in their context will \nbe risky and dangerous. Nevertheless, the status quo begs the \nquestion as to whether this church or any other can be effective as \nministers of reconciliation, ambassadors for Christ (2 Cor 5:18-20), \nbringing the Gospel of peace to the world while disharmony and \ndistrust prevails within the church itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not confusing harmony and unity with unanimity and homogeneity. \nThe issues that divide the church (and society at-large) are \ncomplicated and nuanced. It will be impossible to achieve total \nagreement. At the same time, however, I hear voices from all sides \nthat express more misunderstanding about the positions of others than \nreasons for their own stance. Partisans attribute to their \nopponents bad faith, amorality or immorality, and heartlessness or \nheadlessness. The church needs people of good will and great \ncourage to open avenues of understanding and trust. Christians should \nbe able to talk about areas of disagreement without doubting the \nsincerity (and Christianity, in some cases) of those holding contrary \npositions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIncidentally, true dialogue requires openness to the possibility that \nsomeone else may have a point.\u0014",

    "words": "Mahalia Jackson's story is one of many in which people overcome great \nobstacles in order to reach their full potential. The children of \nIsrael, themselves a people without a home, wandering around in the \ndesert after escaping from their own Duke-like task masters, came to \nthe banks of the flooded Jordan River and saw it as an insurmountable \nobstacle to the realization of their hopes and dreams. The promised \nland lay just on the other side, but the barrier was too great. Too \ngreat, of course, unless it's God who's leading the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo wonder the Jordan River and the promised land were favorite \nmetaphors for the slaves of the Civil War era and in the civil rights \nmovement. Michael P. Graves and David Fillingim in their bookMore \nThan Precious Memories: The Rhetoric of Southern Gospel Music, shed \nsome light upon the imagery and metaphor of the Jordan river and the \npromised land for the Civil War-era slave: \"The themes of 'Jordan' \nand 'Canaan' have biblical connotations, but surely there is some \ninfluence from another source of songs in the South. The Jordan River \nwas a euphemism among Southern slaves for the Ohio River. If slaves \ncould cross the Ohio River into free states, then they would be made \nfree. In essence, the area north of the Ohio river was viewed as the \npromised land. Slave songs used the Jordan River and the promised \nland to communicate about freedom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs they stand at the river's edge, God offers the Israelites freedom, \nbut with it comes a challenge -- step into the raging water, and see \nwhat I will do. Trust me, be faithful and watch what happens. This \nisn't the kind of miracle that simply happens for the Israelites. In \norder to see it become a reality, they have to be willing to take a \nstep -- a risky step -- toward the promise that waits on the other \nside of the river.\u0014",

    "title": "BELIEVING DESPITE GRIEVOUS SUFFERING",
    "words": "Believing despite grievous suffering\u0014\n\u0014\nMolly T. Marshall | January 3, 2017   Baptist Global News\u0014\n\u0014\nCarnage surrounds the birth of the child Jesus. All was not peace and \ngood will. The Gospel reading for the first Sunday following \nChristmas recounts the fury of Herod and his order to kill all male \nchildren who were 2 years old and younger living in and around \nBethlehem (Matthew 2:16). The magi had outwitted him, and his new \nawareness that a rival, albeit a baby, was on the scene drove his \nunhinged response. Pastors rarely preach the slaughter of the \ninnocents, for it is nearly an unredeemable narrative.\u0014\n\u0014\nVisual representations of this heinous order, repugnant with grisly \ndetails, are a form of artistic protest. Fully armed soldiers, \nprotecting themselves against the helpless, brandish bloody swords in \nthe foreground; they are surrounded by a panorama of dismembered \nchildren, wailing mothers and fathers bowed down in grief, and the \ncrush of bewildered townsfolk. Peter Paul Rubens Massacre of the \nInnocents was closely linked with the suffering of his own land, \nparticularly Antwerp, where over 8,000 were slaughtered in the \nreligious wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The scene \nin Bethlehem is far from an isolated event\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did Jesus learn of this murderous act? It is not clear, but as he \nmatured he observed that his ministry would bring a sword, and \ndivision of households would accompany his teaching. Religious zeal \nmatters, but not when it turns to violence. While still a child, he \ndoes not yet know of the suffering catalyzed by his mysterious birth, \nbut his parents carried an extra burden. Surely the news had spread \nfrom Bethlehem to Nazareth about the rampage of the soldiers. Had \nJoseph and Mary returned with the child to Bethlehem, the absence of \nany playmates his age would have been stunning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey returned to Nazareth instead, guided once more by an angelic \nmessenger through a dream. Here they will make their home and try to \nfit into the social circles they once knew. One can imagine that they \nreturned to rumors and sotto voce remarks when Mary and her son \nwalked by. They remembered a very pregnant newlywed who left town \nbefore the birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis tragic story is one of the hardest texts of Scripture, and we \nprefer to bask in the lingering glow of the birth narratives rather \nthan engage this tale of terror. The providence of God  sparing one \nlittle boy while others perished  is scandalous, as Frank Tupper \ndescribes it. Too bad the other families of Bethlehem did not get the \nword. Only later will some proportionality return: the one will give \nhis life for the many. Yet, this is of little comfort to those who \nhave lost children because of some larger purpose, such as the return \nto Nazareth being a fulfillment of prophecy (Matthew 2:23).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the great difficulty of faithful belief, discerning the hand \nof God while human suffering continues unabated. It is one of the \nmajor Jewish protests against believing that the Messiah has truly \ncome. Would things not look different if he had?\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring Herods time, there was little people could do to protect \ntheir family, other than flee. Sadly, this scenario is being played \nout around our globe, and the great migrations of people too often \ncompound misery.\u0014\n\u0014\nDaily we witness the bloodbath in Aleppo, only one place among the \nmany contexts where people are stripped of security. Hill tribes in \nMyanmar continue to experience threat in remote areas, and warfare is \nnever vanquished for long. They have been forced off of their tribal \nland, and they make their way to camps along the Burma-Thai border. \nVillages in Africa dare not forsake their vigilance in resisting Boko \nHaram, for many lives are at risk, especially those of young women. \nLike the voice heard in Ramah, the grief of these resounds throughout \nthe world:\u0014\n\u0014\nwailing and loud lamentation,\u0014\nRachel weeping for her children;\u0014\nshe refused to be consoled, because they are no more (Matthew 2:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven this ongoing reality, what is our task as Christians? We cannot \nsettle for clichs about everything happens for a reason. Nor can \nsimplistic notions of the soul-making value of suffering be our \nresponse. Not surprisingly, we usually apply this worn verity to \nsomeone elses life. Even though divine purpose may escape us, we \nstubbornly trust that Holy Wisdom is at work in all of life; however, \nthe hiddenness and imperceptibility of Gods action is hard to bear.\u0014",

They had a hot conversation going \nand ignored me and kept on talking as I went through. According to \nthem, two men in our town, business competitors who were on the outs, \nhad an altercation. The older and more established one, Sam, had \ngone to the business of the other one, Jim, and tried to assault \nhim, had actually backed him up the stairs of his establishment \ntrying to do him harm.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat sounded unbelievable to me. I knew both men. I could not imagine \na scenario like that. So I called Jim and asked him if that had \nhappened. He said, No. Of course not. I havent even seen Sam in \nmonths.\u0014\n\u0014\nI went back to the secretarys office and told them I had called Jim \nand he had denied the whole story. They sat there in sullen silence, \ngiving me dirty looks, until I went back to my office.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I entered my office, I heard one of them say, Well, its the sort \nof thing Sam would do, and they were off and running with more \nstories of what he would do that I am sure soon became stories of \nhe did.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were not bad women. They were church women who taught Sunday \nSchool and cooked meals for the youth fellowship. They helped keep \nthe church going. But they believed the unbelievable, even with clear \nevidence to the contrary. Because that is what they wanted to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know why they wanted to believe those things. The majority of \nfolks in our church would not have believed that story of Sam and \nJim. They also taught Sunday School and chaperoned the youth \nfellowship and cooked meals.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were the same people, in the same town, in the same church, \nsome believing the believable, and some believing the unbelievable.\u0014\n\u0014\nI learned in 60 years of pastoring that its possible to help those \nwho believe the believable to become better believers. Unfortunately, \nits almost impossible to do anything about those who believe the \nunbelievable. Indeed, in theology, they consider themselves better \nbelievers because they believe the unbelievable. Their faith must be \neven stronger and better, they think, if they believe by faith what \nis unbelievable by evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know what to do about those folks. I must respect them, which \nmeans taking them and what they believe seriously, and explaining the \nevidence and asking them to believe the believable rather than the \nunbelievable, and accepting paradoxes and mysteries. But I cant let \nthem make decisions for me or the church or the nation on the basis \nof their unbelievable beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nJRMcF\u0014\njohnrobertmcfarland@gmail.com\u0014",

    "title": "BUNDLING",
    "words": "\u0014\nBundling, or tarrying, is the traditional practice of wrapping one \nperson in a bed accompanied by another, usually as a part of courting \nbehavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the \nNetherlands or in the British Isles and later became common in \ncolonial United States,\\[1]\\[2] especially in Pennsylvania Dutch \nCountry. Some Nebraska Amish may still practice it. When used for \ncourtship, the aim is to allow intimacy without sexual intercourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is possible the precedent for bundling came from the biblical \nstory of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an \nolder wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage \nroom while not touching; the pair later get married.\u0014\n\u0014\nCourtship practice\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at \nthe residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the \ngirl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. \nOccasionally a bundling board or bundling sack was placed between the \nboy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn United States \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Colonial United States, Jonathan Edwards and other preachers \ncondemned bundling; yet the practice continued into the period of the \nearly Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were \npermitted to bundle with locals. This seemingly strange practice \nallowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed. Some hotels \nrented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a \nbed entailed an additional fee.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost \neverywhere, with only isolated mentions of the practice amongst the \nAmish in Ohio and Pennsylvania.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nBundling is usually associated with the Amish as a form of courtship \nin which the young people, fully clothed except for their shoes, \noccupy the same bed. The custom seems to have been quite general \namong them until the beginning of the 19th century. Somerset County \n(Pennsylvania) Amish ministers condemned the practice in a conference \nin 1830. Later several families left Somerset County to found a \ncolony in Iowa hoping to leave the custom behind, but their efforts \nwere not entirely successful. In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the \ncustom died out in some sections before 1880. Although disapproved by \nthe Amish ministers and many family heads, the custom lingered on in \nparts of northern Indiana and elsewhere. One reason for the \npersistence of bundling among the Amish probably is their extreme \nreluctance to relinquish the customs practiced by the forefathers. \nSuch long-established customs have acquired an almost religious \nsignificance. Either the custom is not so generally practiced as is \ncommonly believed, however, or Amish young people observe it in a \nspirit of self-restraint. At any rate cases of illegitimacy are rare \namong the Amish. Bundling was not a custom confined to Amish \nfamilies, but according to a research article in The Mentor (October \n1929) it was imported to America in the 17th and 18th centuries with \nthe Welsh, the English, the Dutch, the Germans, and even the \nCalvinistic Scottish. Jonathan Edwards preached against bundling, and \nBoston, Salem, and New York proscribed it by law. In the 1950s it was \nstill to be found in a few townships in New England, survived in \nvestige form in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and was practiced in the \nmountains of Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina.\u0014\n\u0014\n---Global Amish Dictionary\u0014",

One wonders if it will extend beyond the \nSBC's life as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nTBMB, the state's connection to the SBC, seems more interested in \ntheological homogeneity than diversity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is troubling because the great strength of Baptists historically \nhas been in the diverse voices that paint a vibrant kaleidoscope of \nGod's love for all.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we narrow those voices, we narrow our opportunities to experience \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Biblical authority: They misuse Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only rationale I heard in the meeting for not seating the church \nwas a vague proof-text reference to what I presume was 1 Timothy \n2:12, \"I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man; \nshe is to keep silent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might be interesting to consider other verses that appear in the \nsame chapter: \"I desire, then, that in every place the men should \npray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument; also, that the \nwomen should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable \nclothing, not with their hair braided, or with gold, pearls or \nexpensive clothes\" (1 Timothy 2:8-9).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are to accept these verses as literal instructions from God for \nworship, then my congregation should get kicked to the curb also. I \nsee designer clothes, pearls and gold every Sunday and often a woman \nwill pray publicly.\u0014\n\u0014\nProof-texting as means of biblical interpretation does not work. It \nis a disrespectful, inappropriate use of the holy text to cherry-pick \nverses and selfishly use them to control and undermine people.\u0014\n3. Our mission: There are people who have left the church because of \nits sexist views about a woman's place in society, home and, of \ncourse, the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the reality of our culture today. One of the things I see in \nJesus' life, ministry, death and resurrection is a radical \nreinterpretation of the beliefs handed to him by religious \nauthorities.\u0014\nAs he deconstructs what was handed to him by his tradition, he widens \nand deepens the love of God. He calls us to steward our lives \naccordingly.\u0014",

    "words": "Back from Captivity, Jews Completed New Temple\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 539 BC, Babylon fell to a coalition of Medes and Persians. The new \nrulers of the Mid East made it their policy to restore captive \nnations to their respective homelands. Among those captives were the \nJews. They returned to Judah with authority to rebuild their temple. \nSeventeen years later, construction still languished, and God raised \nup the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to rebuke the neglect of his \nhouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 520 Haggai preached \"Is it time for you to live in your paneled \nhouses while this house lies in ruin?\" Through Haggai, the Lord asked \nthe Jews how they had fared since their return. \"You have sown much \nand harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, \nbut you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is \nwarm; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with \nholes\" (Haggai 1:6, Revised Standard Version). Haggai said God wanted \nthem to bring wood and rebuild His house.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudah's political and religious leaders listened. Under their \nleadership, the remnant of exiles who had returned to Israel rebuilt \nGod's house, which was completed on this day, March 12, 515 BC But it \nwasn't much to look at.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it not in your sight as nothing?\" the Lord asked them. Well, they \nshould not think that way. God's Spirit was with them. And a day was \ncoming when the Lord would shake Heaven and earth, the sea and the \ndry land. \"I will fill this house with splendor,\" God promised. \"The \nlatter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former,\" said \nthe Lord. \"From this day on, I will bless you,\" he promised.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe temple, rebuilt in 515 BC, was rebuilt yet again by Herod the \nGreat, who restored it in stone and covered it with gold. It was that \ntemple that Christ visited in his life, bringing it glory. A \ngeneration after Christ's death and resurrection, Herod's temple was \ncast down by the Romans. A mosque now stands on its platform.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaggai also prophesied that all the nations would bring their \ntreasures to the temple.  \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBible. O.T.

    "title": "BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF RUFFIN AND GO FOR WAND",
    "words": "Thirty years later, the death of Ruffian after the infamous match \nrace against Foolish Pleasure would be written about quite \ndifferently. In 1975, her iron will and fierce speed was packed into \nan almost mythical female package. The big black filly also had an \nundeniably fiery personality that was as big a part of her reputation \nas her racetrack accomplishments. Ruffian's breakdown at Belmont came \nduring a televised event, and the failure of a subsequent surgery \nadded an extra layer of heartbreak to the fans who loved her. \u0014\n\u0014\nCoverage of Ruffian's demise was sympathetic in a way previous media \ntreatment of breakdowns had not been, and that sympathy was just as \nraw even decades after the event. Much was made of the fact she came \nout of anesthesia with legs flailing as though she were still \ngalloping, trying to catch Foolish Pleasure. One 1990 Louisville \nCourier-Journal headline read, 15 years ago, Ruffian died as she had \nlived  fighting.\u0014\n\u0014\nHorses have (lacrimal) glands, wrote Jack Mann. The tears were \nstreaming down Ruffian's face when the ambulance delivered her to \ntrainer Frank Whiteley's barn. Dr. Manuel Gillman removed the air \ncast and put her bleeding foot into a bucket of ice, which \nimmediately assumed the color of cola. The ankle mechanism was not \nmerely fractured, but shattered.  \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the aftermath, reporters provided not just gut-punching, \nanthropomorphic tributes to a horse who captured a nation, but \nexplainers to educate distraught fans about the injury she suffered \nand why it proved irreparable. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1980s, trade publications and newspapers began publishing the \nfirst studies looking for fatal injury risk factors. Those early \nreports weren't as broad-based as the modern Equine Injury Database, \nand some of their conclusions would later be contradicted by the EID, \nbut there was an interest in understanding the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in the early 1990s, racing had another bad run. In 1990, Go for \nWand broke down in especially horrifying fashion in the stretch run \nof the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park. Mr. Nickerson went down \nsoon after the start of that year's Breeders' Cup Sprint of an \napparent heart attack, and Shaker Knit injured his spinal cord when \ntripping over Mr. Nickerson. In 1992 at Gulfstream Park, Mr. Brooks \ndied in the Sprint, seriously injuring rider Lester Piggot, who had \nallegedly been unhappy with the way the horse warmed up. All of it \nwas on television. Some stations replayed Go for Wand's falter and \ndangling, shattered ankle ad nauseam after the injury. Before the \n1993 Breeders' Cup, Sports Illustrated ran a multi-page spread with a \nstory by Bill Nack, framed almost entirely with photos of the great \nfilly stumbling, falling, legs in the air, broken leg dangling \nghoulishly, and finally lying still on the dirt track. \u0014\n\u0014\nNack's lead began: Go for Wand was lying on the racetrack near the \nwinner's circle, her eyes showing panic and rimmed with white, when \nall at once she stopped struggling and was motionless, except for the \nrapid rising and falling of her sides, like a bellows. Outrider Steve \nErck was kneeling at Go for Wand's head, his right knee pressed into \nher neck so that she could not rise, while a woman, crying \nhysterically, pleaded with him from behind a fence a few feet away: \n'Help herPlease help her.'\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's impossible to read Nack's reporting of the event without feeling \nsome degree of horror and sadness, whether you're a hardened horseman \nor a total outsider, and part of the reason is his attention to the \nfrightened horse's pain, panic, and confusion throughout the \nexperience.\u0014",

    "title": "BONNIE AND CLYDE",
    "words": "Bonnie \nand Clyde\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie Parker was a high school honor roll student turned notorious \ncriminal. \u0014\n\u0014\nClyde Champion Barrow and his companion, Bonnie Parker, were shot to \ndeath by officers in an ambush near Sailes, Bienville Parish, \nLouisiana on May 23, 1934, after one of the most colorful and \nspectacular manhunts the nation had seen up to that time.\u0014\nBarrow was suspected of numerous killings and was wanted for murder, \nrobbery, and state charges of kidnapping.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe FBI, then called the Bureau of Investigation, became interested \nin Barrow and his paramour late in December 1932 through a singular \nbit of evidence. A Ford automobile, which had been stolen in \nPawhuska, Oklahoma, was found abandoned near Jackson, Michigan in \nSeptember of that year. At Pawhuska, it was learned another Ford car \nhad been abandoned there which had been stolen in Illinois. A search \nof this car revealed it had been occupied by a man and a woman, \nindicated by abandoned articles therein. In this car was found a \nprescription bottle, which led special agents to a drug store in \nNacogdoches, Texas, where investigation disclosed the woman for whom \nthe prescription had been filled was Clyde Barrows aunt.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther investigation revealed that the woman who obtained the \nprescription had been visited recently by Clyde Barrow, Bonnie \nParker, and Clydes brother, L. C. Barrow. It also was learned that \nthese three were driving a Ford car, identified as the one stolen in \nIllinois. It was further shown that L. C. Barrow had secured the \nempty prescription bottle from a son of the woman who had originally \nobtained it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 20, 1933, the United States Commissioner at Dallas, Texas, \nissued a warrant against Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, charging \nthem with the interstate transportation, from Dallas to Oklahoma, of \nthe automobile stolen in Illinois. The FBI then started its hunt for \nthis elusive pair.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackground\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde met in Texas in January, 1930. At the time, Bonnie \nwas 19 and married to an imprisoned murderer; Clyde was 21 and \nunmarried. Soon after, he was arrested for a burglary and sent to \njail. He escaped, using a gun Bonnie had smuggled to him, was \nrecaptured and was sent back to prison. Clyde was paroled in February \n1932, rejoined Bonnie, and resumed a life of crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to the automobile theft charge, Bonnie and Clyde were \nsuspects in other crimes. At the time they were killed in 1934, they \nwere believed to have committed 13 murders and several robberies and \nburglaries. Barrow, for example, was suspected of murdering two \npolice officers at Joplin, Missouri and kidnapping a man and a woman \nin rural Louisiana. He released them near Waldo, Texas. \u0014\nNumerous sightings followed, linking this pair with bank robberies \nand automobile thefts. Clyde allegedly murdered a man at Hillsboro, \nTexas; committed robberies at Lufkin and Dallas, Texas; murdered one \nsheriff and wounded another at Stringtown, Oklahoma; kidnaped a \ndeputy at Carlsbad, New Mexico; stole an automobile at Victoria, \nTexas; attempted to murder a deputy at Wharton, Texas; committed \nmurder and robbery at Abilene and Sherman, Texas; committed murder at \nDallas, Texas; abducted a sheriff and the chief of police at \nWellington, Texas; and committed murder at Joplin and Columbia, \nMissouri.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Crime Spree Begins\u0014\n\u0014\nLater in 1932, Bonnie and Clyde began traveling with Raymond \nHamilton, a young gunman. Hamilton left them several months later and \nwas replaced by William Daniel Jones in November 1932.\u0014\n\u0014\nIvan M. Buck Barrow, brother of Clyde, was released from the Texas \nState Prison on March 23, 1933, having been granted a full pardon by \nthe governor. He quickly joined Clyde, bringing his wife, Blanche, so \nthe group now numbered five persons. This gang embarked upon a series \nof bold robberies which made headlines across the country. They \nescaped capture in various encounters with the law. However, their \nactivities made law enforcement efforts to apprehend them even more \nintense. During a shootout with police in Iowa on July 29, 1933, Buck \nBarrow was fatally wounded and Blanche was captured. Jones, who was \nfrequently mistaken for Pretty Boy Floyd, was captured in November \n1933 in Houston, Texas by the sheriffs office. Bonnie and Clyde went \non together. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn November 22, 1933, a trap was set by the Dallas, Texas sheriff and \nhis deputies in an attempt to capture Bonnie and Clyde near Grand \nPrairie, Texas, but the couple escaped the officers gunfire. They \nheld up an attorney on the highway and took his car, which they \nabandoned at Miami, Oklahoma. On December 21, 1933, Bonnie and Clyde \nheld up and robbed a citizen at Shreveport, Louisiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn January 16, 1934, five prisoners, including Raymond Hamilton (who \nwas serving sentences totaling more than 200 years), were liberated \nfrom the Eastham State Prison Farm at Waldo, Texas by Clyde Barrow, \naccompanied by Bonnie Parker. Two guards were shot by the escaping \nprisoners with automatic pistols, which had been previously concealed \nin a ditch by Barrow. As the prisoners ran, Barrow covered their \nretreat with bursts of machine-gun fire. Among the escapees was Henry \nMethvin of Louisiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Last Months\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 1, 1934, Bonnie and Clyde encountered two young highway \npatrolmen near Grapevine, Texas. Before the officers could draw their \nguns, they were shot. On April 6, 1934, a constable at Miami, \nOklahoma fell mortally wounded by Bonnie and Clyde, who also abducted \na police chief, whom they wounded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe FBI had jurisdiction solely on the charge of transporting a \nstolen automobile, although the activities of the Bureau agents were \nvigorous and ceaseless. Every clue was followed. Wanted notices \nfurnishing fingerprints, photograph, description, criminal record, \nand other data were distributed to all officers. The agents followed \nthe trail through many states and into various haunts of the Barrow \ngang, particularly Louisiana. The association with Henry Methvin and \nthe Methvin family of Louisiana was discovered by FBI agents, and \nthey found that Bonnie and Clyde had been driving a car stolen in New \nOrleans.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 13, 1934, an FBI agent, through investigation in the \nvicinity of Ruston, Louisiana, obtained information which definitely \nplaced Bonnie and Clyde in a remote section southwest of that \ncommunity. The home of the Methvins was not far away, and the agent \nlearned of visits there by Bonnie and Clyde. Special agents in Texas \nhad learned that Clyde and his companion had been traveling from \nTexas to Louisiana, sometimes accompanied by Henry Methvin.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe FBI and local law enforcement authorities in Louisiana and Texas \nconcentrated on apprehending Bonnie and Clyde, whom they strongly \nbelieved to be in the area. It was learned that Bonnie and Clyde, \nwith some of the Methvins, had staged a party at Black Lake, \nLouisiana on the night of May 21, 1934 and were due to return to the \narea two days later.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore dawn on May 23, 1934, a posse composed of police officers from \nLouisiana and Texas, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, concealed \nthemselves in bushes along the highway near Sailes, Louisiana. In the \nearly daylight, Bonnie and Clyde appeared in an automobile and when \nthey attempted to drive away, the officers opened fire. Bonnie and \nClyde were killed instantly. Some say they were hit with more than 50 \nbullets each; others say it was 25 apiece. Either way, Bonnie and \nClyde died instantly.\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notorious couple made headlines during the Great Depression\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Charles Montaldo \u0014\nUpdated November 02, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde were notorious outlaws who made headlines across the \ncountry during the Great Depression. During those tough times for \nmany Americans, the flamboyant pair was seen by some as a romantic \nyoung couple looking for adventure, though they were blamed for \nkilling 13 people and committing countless other crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie Parker was just shy of 5 feet tall, all of 90 pounds, a \npart-time waitress and amateur poet from a poor Dallas home who was \nbored with life and wanted something more. Clyde Barrow was a \nfast-talking, small-time thief from a similarly destitute Dallas \nfamily who hated poverty and wanted to make a name for himself. \nTogether, they became the most notorious crime couple in American \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir story, though often romanticized on the silver screen, was \nhardly glamorous. From summer 1932 until spring 1934, they left a \ntrail of violence and terror in their wake as they crisscrossed the \ncountryside robbing gas stations, village groceries, and the \noccasional bank and taking hostages when they got into a tight spot.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Dallas Observer noted about Bonnie: \"although the authorities who \ngunned down the 23-year-old in 1934 conceded that she was no \nbloodthirsty killer and that when taken into custody she tended to \ninspire the paternal aspects of the police who held her...there was a \nmystifying devolution from the high school poet, speech class star, \nand mini-celebrity who performed Shirley Temple-like as a warm-up act \nat the stump speeches of local politicians to the accomplice of \nrage-filled Clyde Barrow.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the poem \"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde\" by Bonnie herself, she \nwrote,\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Some day they'll go down together\u0014\nAnd they'll bury them side by side.\u0014\nTo few it'll be grief,\u0014\nTo the law a relief\u0014\nBut it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the two were not destined to lie together, as she had written. \nParker initially was buried in the Fishtrap Cemetery in Dallas, but \nin 1945 she was moved to the new Crown Hill Cemetery, also in Dallas.\u0014\nClyde was buried in the city's Western Heights Cemetery next to his \nbrother Marvin.\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Clyde Barrow Wrote a Letter to Henry Ford \u0014\nBy Jennifer Rosenberg \u0014\nUpdated January 21, 2020 \u0014\n\u0014\nClyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker are infamous for their two-year crime \nspree from 1932 until their deaths in a hail of bullets in 1934. More \namazing than his novice murders and robberies was Clyde's uncanny \nability to evade the police even when he was surrounded.\u0014\n\u0014\nPart of Clyde's ability to evade capture was in his skill as a \ndriver, while the other part was most definitely in the choices of \ncars that he stole. Quite often, Clyde would be in a car that could \noutmaneuver and outrun any of the police cars that attempted to \nfollow him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditionally, living a life on the run meant that Clyde and Bonnie \nspent days and even weeks at a time in their car while traveling long \ndistances and sleeping in their car at night.\u0014\n\u0014\nClyde Barrow and the Ford V-8 \u0014\nThe car that Clyde preferred, one that offered both speed and \ncomfort, was the Ford V-8. Clyde was so thankful for these cars that \nhe wrote Henry Ford a letter on April 10, 1934.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe letter read:\u0014\n\u0014\nTulsa, Okla\u0014\n10th April\u0014\nMr. Henry Ford\u0014\nDetroit Mich.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Sir: --\u0014\nWhile I still have got breath in my lungs I will tell you what a \ndandy car you make. I have drove Fords exclusively when I could get \naway with one. For sustained speed and freedom from trouble the Ford \nhas got ever other car skinned and even if my business hasen't been \nstrickly legal it don't hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you \ngot in the V8 --\u0014\n\u0014\nYours truly\u0014\nClyde Champion Barrow\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years, many have questioned the authenticity of Clyde's \nletter to Henry Ford, based on a discrepancy over handwriting. The \nletter is currently on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, \nMichigan.\u0014",

    "title": "BALLLINGTON BOOTH FOUNDED VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA",
    "words": "Ballington Booth Founded Volunteers of America\u0014\n\u0014\nBallington Booth was born on this day, July 28, 1857 into one of the \nmost extraordinary families the world has known. His father and \nmother were the famous evangelists William and Catherine Booth, \nfounders of the Salvation Army, and their children were trained to \nbecome evangelists themselves. Ballington did, playing at church as a \nchild. As he grew older, he possessed a tall, handsome and striking \nappearance and exhibited great natural gifts, so that he commanded \nattention wherever he went.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis talent equalled his looks. A reporter once remarked that when \nBallington \"devoted himself to religion, the stage lost a good actor, \nthe forum an orator.\" He did not hesitate, for instance, to twist his \nblack hair into mock horns as he spoke of the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nBallington married the lively and beautiful Maud Charlesworth. The \ntwo would work well together. After serving in various capacities, \nincluding as leaders of the Australian Salvation Army, Ballington was \nasked to head the American work, which would still be directed from \nEngland. He and Maud arrived in the United States in 1887, under the \nclear understanding that this was to be a temporary assignment. The \ntwo fell in love with the country and became naturalized American \ncitizens.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, the administrative structure which tried to manage the \nAmerican Army from across the Atlantic in England did not work well. \nBallington introduced a more democratic and patriotic tone. Friction \ngrew with the home office. In 1895, William reassigned his son. \nBallington refused to leave. He seceded from the Salvation Army in \nJanuary 1896 and asked its leaders to join him in forming a new \norganization. He had barred his sister Eva from the meeting.

    "words": "Bishop Tweets #WrongTrump following the Death of Robert Trump\u0014\nMilton Quintanilla | Contributor for ChristianHeadlines.com | \nTuesday, August 18, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the death of Donald Trumps younger brother Robert, the \nhashtag #WrongTrump started trending, implying that the President \nshould have been the one to die instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne post that gained particular steam came from Bishop Talbert Swan, \na radio host, activist and president of the NAACP, The Blaze reports. \nSwan has been an outspoken critic of Trump as well as his White \nevangelical supporters on social media.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christian Headlines previously reported, last month, Swan was \njoined by Actress Alyssa Milano and other guests in a virtual panel \narguing that White evangelicals contribute to systemic racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sunday, Swan, amongst others Trump critics, used the hashtag \n#wrongtrump, resulting in over 100,000 posts as it trended on Twitter.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Grim Reaper, you took the #wrongtrump, Swan wrote on Sunday \nmorning.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwans post was met with criticism from Christians and Trump \nsupporters, including conservative black commentators.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou [are] going to hell. The Bible warned us of fake pastor, Black \nconservative activist McKayla J wrote to Swan.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwan quipped in response, Do you want me to tell your mother or any \nof your other family members you said hi when I get there?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This person is a bishop?? another black commenter asked. Who \nordained him please? The devil??\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother black user wrote,  \"1 John 4:20 - If anyone says, 'I love \nGod,' and hates his brother, he is a liar, for he who does not have \nlove for his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not \nseen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral hours later, Swan preached a sermon for the Spring of Hope \nChurch of God in Christ in Springfield, Massachusetts. During the \nopening prayer of the service, a woman asked God to provide His \nblessings and to \"touch those that are grieving this morning, touch \nthose that lost loved ones this morning, in the name of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of the service, Swan subtly addressed the backlash he \nreceived over his tweet.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I know some of y'all are getting salty with me already ... the \ntrolls are already mad with me ... they've been calling the church \nall morning, leaving messages all morning, they've been all over our \nlivestream, he noted. They mad, they big mad, but you know what? I \nfound out that ... when you get the devil mad like that, you must be \ndoing something right.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSwan went on to add, \"for those of y'all who are salty with me, I \nreally don't care\" and then laughed before adding, \"Jimmy crack corn \n...\"   referencing the popular childrens song that blackface \nminstrel groups first performed in the 1840s.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the sermon, Swan asserted that God will draw all people from \nall walks of life to Himself, including white people, black people \nand other ethnicities, as well as \"the gay ... the straight ... the \ntransgender ... the asexual ... the bisexual ... the conservative ... \nthe liberal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In this dark world, in this pandemic season, in this moment of civil \nunrest, what the world needs now is the love of God,\" Swan added, \n\"and the love of God only comes through the people of God, and you \nare the children of God, and the Lord wants to untie you from your \nhabits and untie you from your way of thinking and untie you from the \nmundane things of this world and to set you free.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're too caught up in our own selfish agendas to be a part of God's \nagenda,\" he stressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday, Swan said that he had received 517 vitriolic, racist, \nthreatening voicemails, 249 emails, 432 social media inboxes, and \nover 4000 racist comments across social media from conservative, \nTrump-supporting, so-called Christians since his post on Sunday \nmorning.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheyve threatened to castrate me, put a bullet hole in my head, \nhang me, murder me, kill my family, and shoot up my church, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe went on to state he has contacted the FBI and other law \nenforcement to track down those who threatened him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd they wonder why we believe Trump supporters are all racists and \nthat white evangelicalism is nothing but white supremacy in drag, \nSwan said.\u0014",

    "words": "Baptists Must Reckon with Their Past Backing of Slavery\u0014\nby Scott Stearman | Aug 20, 2020 |\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact Baptists dont broadly recognize how our backing of slavery \nand its offspring, structural racism, was based on our religion is \nitself a testimony of all the whitewashing that has taken place in \nour written history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Baptists were advocating for those of other faiths to worship \nin freedom, those same Baptists, particularly in the South, were also \nsubjecting people of African descent to violence. This is true not in \nspite of religious commitments but because of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious ideology, rooted in biblical interpretations, allayed the \nconscience of the slave trader, gave harbor to the heart of the slave \nowner and compelled many who hated the evil done to generations of \nother humans to remain silent.\u0014\n\u0014\nA key cornerstone of this ideological pathology was the curse of Ham. \nIn Genesis, we find this story of Noah who provoked by his son Ham, \nwho saw the nakedness of his father, cursed Hams son, Canaan, and \nhis lineage to perpetual servitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many scholars agree the original purpose was likely to justify \nthe subjection of the Canaanite people to the Israelites, later the \nstory was interpreted as an origin story for those with black skin \nand a justification for enslavement.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil very recently, the Latter-Day Saints used the curse of Ham to \nprevent the ordination of Black men.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Julian Lucas sums it up well in a 2019 essay in The New York \nTimes, The passage makes no reference to Africa, but centuries of \nMuslim, Jewish and Christian commentators have tethered Hams curse \nto blackness, thereby justifying slavery from the plantations of the \nDeep South to the salt mines of the Sahara.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that a strain of this ideological sickness is still present \nin many of the Baptist traditions is evident in current polling.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent article, Robert Jones provides compelling evidence that \nin public opinion polls white Christians are consistently more \nlikely than whites who are religiously unaffiliated to deny the \nexistence of structural racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals in the U.S. south (of which Baptists make up the \nmajority) are among the worst in this regard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one clear explanation for this unsettling reality. It is \nonly in recent decades that white Baptists would understand that \nsubjugation and slavery were antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTIST CALVINISTS DEFEND SLAVERY OF SBC FOUNDERS",
    "words": "Baptist Calvinists defend slavery of Southern Seminary founders\u0014\n\u0014\n    BRIAN KAYLOR  |  SEPTEMBER 9, 2020    BAPTIST NEWS GLOBAL\u0014\n\u0014\nAs some Black Southern Baptists urge their denominations flagship \nseminary to remove honors to enslavers, prominent white Calvinists \nassociated with the school are defending not only the founders but \neven slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nDwight McKissic, pastor of Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, \nTexas, is leading the push for changing campus building names at \nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.\u0014\n \u0014\nSouthern Seminary founders, clockwise from top left: Boyce, Manly, \nWilliams, Broadus.\u0014\nIn 2018, SBTS released a 71-page report detailing how its four \nfounders  James Boyce, John Broadus, Basil Manly Jr. and William \nWilliams  together enslaved more than 50 persons. Additionally, \nBoyce served in the Confederate Army, and Broadus was a Confederate \nchaplain. Each are still honored today on campus with building names \nand even on memorabilia like coffee mugs.\u0014\nBut amid calls for removing the names of the enslaver founders from \nbuildings, some white Calvinists are pushing back.\u0014\nNettles: Wrong to remove names of founders\u0014\n\u0014\nTom Nettles, a longtime professor at SBTS before retiring in 2014, \npenned a column Aug. 26 on the website of Founders Ministries  a \ngroup devoted to promoting Calvinism within the Southern Baptist \nConvention  in which he defended the seminarys honors to its \nenslaver founders.\u0014\n\u0014\nNettles characterized McKissics call for removing from buildings the \nnames of the enslaver founders wrong, undesirable and impossible. \nNettles is the author of several books, including James Petigru \nBoyce: A Southern Baptist Statesman.\u0014\nNettles insisted in his Founders Ministries column that being \nantebellum slave owners and even post-bellum white supremacists \ndoesnt mean men like Boyce were necessarily heretical.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding support for slavery in the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the enslavers he defends, Nettles sees support for slavery in \nthe Bible and suggested it was immoral for enslaved persons to \nchallenge or escape the institution of slavery. And he grounds his \njustification for slavery in biblical infallibility and in the \nrevelatory ministry of the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlaves were to do their service gladly to their masters, even to \nthose who were harsh, embracing the opportunity for sanctification \nand for emulation of Christ, Nettles wrote. They were to consider \nthat their work transcended a merely earthly task and was done as \nunto the Lord. In their faithful service, considering their master as \nworthy of all honor, they would adorn gospel doctrine.\u0014\nBelieving the Bible allowed slavery and required submission by the \nenslaved, Nettles even suggests freedom from slavery should only be \nachieved by lawful means.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreedom is superior as a temporal condition to slavery and should be \nachieved when a lawful opportunity arises, he wrote.\u0014\nSBTS President Albert Mohler, a Calvinist who insists the SBTS \nfounders should be honored as champions of Baptist orthodoxy, has \nsimilarly argued that enslaved Black people were wrong to seek to \nescape slavery by unlawful means. Earlier this year, he apologized \nfor comments on Larry King Live in 1998 in which he criticized \nHarriet Tubman and others for running away from slavery, since Mohler \nbelieved the Bible condemned that behavior by the enslaved.\u0014\n\u0014\nNettles also argues that Christians biblically could enslave fellow \nChristians.\u0014\n\u0014\nMasters, like slaves, will be judged according to an absolute \nstandard of justice, Nettles wrote. They were to consider one \nanother, even in this relationship of slave and master, as beloved \nbecause graciously and eternally loved by God and as brothers because \nof having received the Spirit of adoption whereby both cry Abba, \nFather.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, Nettles insists that as long as an enslaver was not an abusive \nenslaver and fought against abuses in the system  even while \nliterally fighting to preserve that abusive system in the Confederacy \n then it is disturbing to call such an enslaver a heretic or \nview his character and doctrine with suspicion.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, however, Nettles urges people to simply overlook the \nslavery legacies of Boyce and the other SBTS founders.\u0014\nDesire to separate the founders from slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mohler has tried, Nettles attempts to separate being an enslaver \nand preaching support for slavery from the theology of the seminarys \nfounders. This perspective says that viewing Black people as lesser \nthan white people is not a theological issue and therefore cannot be \nheld against the teachings of the enslaver founders.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe elimination of slavery by the Emancipation Proclamation and the \nSouths defeat in the Civil War did not change the theology of Boyce \nand the seminary cohort in any of these truths of revelation, \nNettles insists.\u0014\n\u0014\nNettles also argues that if the names had to come off the buildings, \nthen everything the founders taught or believed would also have to be \nremoved  even though McKissic had previously explained that he still \nthought the men should be taught, just not so honored. For Nettles, \nhowever, if the founders are rejected in any area for heresy, then \napparently all their theology and writings must be removed.\u0014\nOne must realize how deeply entwined is the very soul of the \nfounders in the ongoing ministry of the school, Nettles wrote. In \norder not to be tainted by the impact of Boyce, should we raze (SBTS) \nlike Jericho and warn against restoring its gates?\u0014\n\u0014\nA Black pastor responds\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Aug. 28, McKissic responded to Nettles, insisting he is fully \nsupportive of the educational mission of SBTS and was instead \nmerely arguing for the removal from their current place of honor the \nnames of Boyce and others who bought, sold or continued to hold \nkidnapped human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am arguing for this so that Southerns mission can be maintained \nwith integrity, McKissic added. As long as our seminary makes \nheroes of those who were men-stealers, she elevates those who \ntaught contrary to the sound teaching (1 Timothy 1:10).\u0014\nLets keep Boyce in our studies. But lets not exalt him as a hero, \nMcKissic added.\u0014\n\u0014\nInsisting that racist chattel slavery is not biblical and not \nhumane, McKissic said Southern Seminarys founders should not be \nhonored on buildings. And he rejected arguments by Nettles that \nattempts by enslavers to evangelize the enslaved means the enslavers \nshould be honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nI appreciate the founders concern for the souls of my ancestors, \nbut there was a better way to bring them the gospel than by \nkidnapping them, chaining them, abusing them, selling them, buying \nthem and holding them as property, McKissic wrote. Evangelism is \nvery, very important, but the human beings we evangelize are \nimportant, too. The founders could have followed Jesuss Great \nCommission by going to my ancestors with the biblical message of \nfreedom rather than by forcing them to come in chains to the \nmasters who bought them like things.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd McKissic isnt alone. As Southern Seminarys fall term started \nlast week, one Black student publicly wrote about his uneasiness of \nattending a preaching class in a chapel named for Broadus, an \nenslaver.\u0014\n\u0014\nOddly enough the man who this chapel is named after would have \nlikely observed me as an individual that he just had to deal with or \neven in his own words, one who belongs to a very low grade of \nhumanity, Deryk Hayes wrote on Aug. 25, along with a selfie of \nhimself wearing a mask in the chapel. As Ive walked across the \ncampus today, I realize that an unfortunate reality is that the \nattitude and heart of John A. Broadus still exists.\u0014\n \u0014\nBrian Kaylor serves as editor of Word & Way in Jefferson City, Mo.\u0014",

    "title": "BEWARE OF SEDITION LAWS",
    "words": "John Adams undoubtedly belongs among the pantheon of the Founding \nFathers, along with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James \nMadison and Benjamin Franklin.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet as the nations second president, Adams was not successful. He \nwas obstinate, opinionated, vain, impatient and he lacked good \njudgment. He was a poor administrator. Furthermore, he was \nthin-skinned and intolerant even of mild criticism directed at him \nand his Federalist Party, especially when it came from his political \nopponents under the influence of Republican Thomas Jefferson.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe struggle between the two factions revolved around monetary \npolicy, state versus federal authority and foreign affairs. Adams and \nhis fellow Federalists favored Great Britain in its seemingly endless \nconflict with France, while Jeffersons followers were Francophiles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe clamor against Adams was relentless, with much of it coming from \nrecent immigrants. Included among them were French aristocrats who \nhad fled their countrys bloody revolution, anti-Royalist English \nradicals and Irish nationalists. Most of these newcomers were \nAnglophobic and staunch backers of the Jeffersonian Republicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we tend to think that the rhetoric invoked by politicians and \ntheir respective media today such as Fox News and MSNBC are partisan \nand sharp-edged, it almost seems tame compared to the invective used \nat the turn of the 19th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth factions engaged in a bitter war of words, pulling no punches. \nEach side outright owned newspapers that trumpeted their respective \nparty lines, and regularly peddled dubious stories of corruption and \nscandal about its opponents.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederalists in Congress decided that it was time to muzzle the \ncritics of Adams. In the summer of 1798, Congress passed four highly \nrestrictive measures collectively known as the Alien and Sedition \nActs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first, a new Naturalization Act, increased the length of \nresidence in the U.S. necessary to attain citizenship from five to 14 \nyears. It also required all aliens to register and to give five \nyears notice of their intention to become citizens.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext came the Alien Act, which permitted the president to expel any \nimmigrant whom he deemed dangerous to the peace and safety of United \nStates. If the alien refused to obey, the president could have him \njailed for up to three years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third, the Alien Enemies Act, empowered the president to imprison \nor banish any alien who was a subject of an enemy nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast came the most controversial measure  the Sedition Act. Clearly \naimed at rival Republicans, it imposed large monetary fines and \nimprisonment of up to two years for anyone who should write, print, \nor utter any false, scandalous and malicious writing ... against the \ngovernment of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe act also included punishment for anyone who criticized or defamed \nmembers of Congress or the president. If that wasnt enough, the \naccused person could be fined for as much as $5,000 (more than \n$100,000 today) and given a jail sentence of up to five years. The \nentire concept of freedom of speech and the press guaranteed in the \nBill of Rights seemed in jeopardy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jeffersonian Republicans denounced the Sedition Act as despotic, \nan alarming assault on free speech and unconstitutional. On the other \nhand, with Adams approval, the Federalists argued that they were \nessential in light of the threat posed by civil unrest fomented by \nrecent immigrants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the power to suppress almost any form of dissent, the \nFederalists went into action. Citing the Sedition Act, Federal \nauthorities arrested 24 Republican newspaper editors, including \nBenjamin Franklins grandson. James Callender, editor of the Richmond \nExaminer, was sentenced to nine months in prison. Many of the \nsedition trials were blatant parodies of justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nCongressman Matthew Lyon, an Irish immigrant, was convicted on three \ncounts of libel and sent to jail in Vermont for a letter he had \npublished questioning Adams sanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson was determined to have these laws overturned. Today, \nresolving the constitutionality of legislation is decided by a \nprocess known as judicial review, whereby the Supreme Court \njustices rule on a laws legitimacy based on their interpretation of \nthe Constitution.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of the courts role and authority as one of three equal \nbranches of government, however, did not come until later. As a \nresult, Jefferson and James Madison attacked the new laws by secretly \ngoing through the Virginia and Kentucky legislatures. The Virginia \nand Kentucky Resolutions, written by Madison and Jefferson, declared \nthe Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional and that in such \ncases, states are duty bound to interpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe acts remained on the books for another decade, but they no longer \nwere enforced, and eventually were repealed or allowed to lapse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey, however, left a permanent stain on the reputation of John \nAdams. His Federalist Party was disrupted and demoralized, never to \nregain control of the national administration. Since then, the few \ntimes that sedition legislation has been imposed, it has created more \ndiscord than ever was intended.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr urged federal prosecutors \nto consider filing sedition charges against protesters in several \nAmerican cities. Although reserved for those who have posed an \nimmediate threat to government authority, such measures usually are a \nviolation of the First Amendment of the Constitution and are \nrescinded by the courts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSilencing free speech is one of the first steps on the road to \ntyranny. Jefferson vehemently opposed any measure that curtailed the \nability of citizens to speak their minds. The threat posed by a \npresident and government with too much power is well worth remaining \nvigilant against today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles F.

    "words": "Bestselling Author, John Bunyan\u0014\nCurtis, Lang, Peterson\u0014\n\u0014\nBestselling Author, John BunyanJohn Bunyan was born in Elstow, \nBedfordshire, England on this day, November 28, 1628. His home was a \nsmall thatched cottage, and his father was a tinker, who spent his \ndays pushing a cart along the roads, stopping at homes to fix metal \npots and pans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung John received a grammar-school education, but like most sons of \nhis day, he learned his father's trade. During the English Civil War \nhe served as a soldier-- probably on the Puritan side. At nineteen he \nmarried, and his Christian wife led him to try to reform his life. \nBut John found himself constantly slipping back into old habits. \nThough he lived well enough to impress his neighbors, he described \nhimself as a \"painted hypocrite.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1651, John began attending an independent meeting at Bedford and \nwas moved by the pastor's intense biblical preaching. He began to \npore over the Scriptures, until the conflict within him ended in the \nassurance of God's grace in his life. Salvation had come to John \nBunyan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined the Bedford congregation and began to preach there, amazing \npeople at the abilities of a \"mere\" tinker. Though King Charles II \nhad at first promised freedom of religion, increasingly the Anglican \nchurch became England's only accepted church. Dissent was not \nencouraged, and in 1661 the authorities sent John to Bedford jail for \nhis preaching. His times in prison were hard on his family and his \nblind daughter. He remained there until 1672, when Charles issued the \nDeclaration of Indulgence, extending leniency to non-Anglicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his release, the Independent meeting house called him as their \npastor. He received a license to preach and became known as Bishop \nBunyan-- perhaps becoming the organizing genius of Independents in \nthe area, But the toleration was not to last.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1675 Bunyan again found himself in prison, and began his greatest \nwork: The Pilgrim's Progress. This allegory of salvation and the \nChristian walk has given us such colorful phrases as \"Vanity Fair,\" \n\"the Slough of Despond,\" \"House Beautiful,\" \"Muckraking,\" and, \n\"Hanging is too good for him.\" Drawing only on his own experience and \nthe Bible, this largely unlettered preacher created a captivating \npiece of literature that appeals to those who travel - or would \ntravel - on the spiritual pilgrimage from the City of Destruction to \nthe Celestial City.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps because so many readers experienced the same sort of \npilgrimage in their lives, The Pilgrim's Progress, became the world's \nbest-selling devotional book. Bunyan describes the most intimate \nstates of the Christian soul. His realization of the depth of God's \ngrace in his own life gave Bunyan an ability to speak to many people, \neven generations, of their own spiritual state. Bunyan's other works, \nGrace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, The Life and Death of Mr. \nBadman, and The Holy War, never achieved the popularity of The \nPilgrim's Progress. This one humbly written work touched thousands of \nlives and became a classic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's book Dates With Destiny by \nCurtis, Lang and Petersen.

    "title": "BILL OF RIGHTS GUARANTEED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY",
    "words": "Bill of Rights Guaranteed Religious Liberty\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1787 a convention in Philadelphia drafted what is usually \nrecognized as the most extraordinary political document of history. \nThe Constitution of the United States created a federal system with \nchecks and balances on power. The world had never seen anything like \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite its benefits, there was doubt it would be ratified by the \nindividual states. Having recently escaped one tyranny, the people of \nthe United States did not want to subject themselves to another. They \nfeared the new constitution because, while it specified the rights of \nthe new government, and gave such rights as the writ of habeas \ncorpus, it did not list other rights that the people felt it should. \nThese could be inferred, but the majority of Americans felt safer \nhaving them spelled out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the most part, those who were for the federal system were for the \nconstitution as it stood. Those who opposed a federal system, wanted \nmore guarantees of rights. Several state conventions asked for such a \nbill. Thomas Jefferson urged that they be given their wish. A \"bill \nof rights is what the people are entitled to against every government \non earth, general or particular, and what no just government should \nrefuse, or rest on inference.\" The U. S. Congress agreed and by a two \nthirds majority passed ten amendments to the constitution, called the \nBill of Rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified. It \nis significant to church history because of its first Amendment: \n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof..\" This amendment was the \nresult of long centuries of efforts by religious groups such as the \nQuakers and Baptists to obtain religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first amendment meant that the Federal government of the United \nStates could not establish a national church, such as was common in \nmany other nations. Anyone could worship as he or she pleased and the \nFederal government could not say \"boo\" except under special \ncircumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nFederal civil rights are not obligatory for states, however. At the \nstate level, established churches continued to exist for some years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany battles have been fought in the courts over just what this \namendment means. Today, when its words are used as an excuse to \nforbid children to pray in school or read a Bible on school property, \nit is good to remember that in the understanding of the generation \nthat adopted the amendment was not that the government should oppose \nreligion or deny it the same rights of expression enjoyed by other \norganizations, but rather that it not impose a national religion nor \nstop people from engaging in their preferred form of worship. It \nguaranteed freedom for worship, not freedom from religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bill of Rights in the United States of America.\" \nhttp://www.magnacartaplus.org/usa-rights/\u0014\nBowen, Catherine Drinker.

It convinced them that leaving slavery was \nnot running away from proper authority; it was escaping injustice. \nThe numerous spirituals composed and revised by enslaved Christians \nreveal this understanding of the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, many spirituals speak of the redemptive power of Christ \nand identify with Jesuss suffering. But a large portion of them sing \nof Moses, Pharaoh, the Promised Land, and the River Jordan. Harriet \nTubman, who composed her own spirituals, sang Im bound for the \nPromised Land, on the other side of Jordan within hearing of her \npuzzled enslaver the night before she fled slavery. She regularly \nsang of Egypt and Canaan while leading fugitives away. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Christians were drawn to a God who explained his character to \nthe children of Israel by saying repeatedly, I am the LORD your God, \nwho brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of \nslavery (Exodus 20:2). Black Christians saw this deliverance as a \ncritically important feature of Gods character and his plan for \nhumanity. Those biblical themes continue to animate Black \nChristianity today. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis Black biblicism emerged in dialogue with, and in reaction to, a \nsociety dominated by Whites. Not only were 90 percent of African \nAmericans in the early nineteenth century enslaved, they were vastly \noutnumbered by White Americans. In this social reality, White \nAmerican Christians could easily deflect difficult questions that \nslavery raised for their faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nA large proportion of northern White Christians considered slavery \nwrong but did not yet conclude from the Bible they ought to support \nabolition, which they viewed as a radical movement. Many nonenslaving \nWhites, North and South, justified slavery with simplistic readings \nof selective biblical texts. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile Christian enslavers shaped the biblical message, \nconsciously or unconsciously, to their interests because they \ncontrolled discussions with enslaved Christians. Until the issue came \nto a head in the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations \nin the 1840s, most Whites were not compelled to listen seriously to \nantislavery arguments from the Bible. After each of those \ndenominations split over slavery, White southerners heard even fewer \nopposing interpretations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian HIstory\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTISM FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW",
    "words": "The apostles read the Old Testament as a preview of Jesus, full of \nblurry snapshots of the coming Savior. Jesus is the last Adam (Rom \n5:1221). Hes the seed of Abraham, a resurrected Isaac (Heb \n11:1719), the living temple of God (John 1:14; 2:1322), the son of \nDavid (Rom 1:14), a prophet like Moses who leads his people in a new \nexodus from the Egypt of sin and death (Luke 9:31; Acts 3:22; 7:37). \nJesus is the key to all the puzzling riddles of the Old Testament. \nThe second-century Greek bishop Irenaeus used a beautiful image to \nexplain this: the Old Testament contains the fragments of a mosaic; \nwhen you put all the pieces together, the mosaic portrays the face of \na handsome prince, Jesus, the Prince of Peace.1 The church fathers \ncalled the Old Testament fragments types (from the Greek, typoi) \nand saw Jesus as the fulfillment or antitype that pulled all the \npieces together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe baptism of Jesus \u0014\n\u0014\nThis has everything to do with baptism. Jesus baptism is the primary \nbaptism. In a sense, it is the one and only baptism. Every other \nbaptism unites us to the baptism of Jesus. Thats why the apostles \nfound blurry snapshots of baptism in the Old Testament, along with \nsnapshots of Jesus. Like Jesus himself, baptism gathers together all \nthe great events and characters of the Bible. Baptism makes us living \nepistles of God, full of his living words.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism is the reality prefigured by the waters of creation and Eden, \nNoahs flood (1 Pet 3:1822), and Israels exodus through the sea (1 \nCor 10:15). The church fathers found types of baptism in Joshuas \nriver-passage into Canaan, Elijahs drenched sacrifice, Elishas \nfloating axe head, the cleansing of the Syrian commander Naaman, and \nJesus healing of the lame man at Bethsaida and of the man born \nblind.3 Jesus arranges all the shiny fragments of the mosaic into a \nbeautiful picture. When were baptized to become members of the \nwhole Christ, all the pieces of Jesus portrait become part of our \nportrait. All the types that prefigure Jesus also prefigure the \nbaptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine explains the distinction between the old and new covenants \nwith a grammatical illustration. Using the future tense, we say, The \nMessiah will be raised. In the perfect tense, we say, The Messiah \nhas been raised. The root word is identical; the two phrases refer \nto the same reality. In Latin, the ending is the only thing that \nchanges, but that tiny alteration of form generates a momentous shift \nin meaning, the difference between I hope for a new life and Ive \nstarted a new life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblical rites are like root words of a language. All of them share a \ncommon meaning. All of them signify Gods promises, which are \nfulfilled in Jesus. Jesus is the meaning of every biblical ritual, \nbut the form of the rituals varies with the times. As a future-tense \nrite, circumcision signified Israels hope for the Messiahs advent \nand triumph. As a present-tense sign, baptism announces the Messiah \nhas come. Jesus is the word of promise, conjugated by the rites of \nIsrael and the Church.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe meaning of baptism\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism is a present-tense sign of the gospel, the good news that \nIrenaeuss prince has arrived in the world. And so baptism makes a \nclaim about the world. It tells us we dont live in the world of \nAbraham, Moses, David, or Jeremiah. We live in a new world and a new \ntime, the world of King Jesus, who rules in the age we call AD (Anno \nDomini, Year of our Lord). The mere fact that Christian baptism \ncascades over planet Earth tells us something has happened to the \nworld, the happening we call Jesus. Baptism shouts, The time is \nfulfilled! The kingdom has come! It tells us that Jesus and the \nSpirit have completed, and are completing, all that the Father \npromised (2 Cor 1:2022), restoring the world to the harmony of \npeace. Baptism is the sign of all of this. It heralds a new time.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism doesnt just picture an announcement. Baptism announces. It \ndoesnt portray preaching; it preaches. Prophets compared the coming \nkingdom to a bursting spring of living water (Isa 44:3), a flood of \ngentiles bearing gifts (Isa 66:12), a cleansing fountain (Zech 13:1). \nAs baptismal water gushes across the globe, God declares these \npromises fulfilled. Baptism is the gospel, good news from a distant \nland (Prov 25:25).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gospel in baptism\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism preaches because its Gods work. Baptism isnt simply water, \nnor water poured, nor water over which a Trinitarian formula is \nintoned. Baptism is an act of the Church, using water in the name of \nthe Trinity to bathe a person entering the Church. Because Jesus \ncommands baptism, it is an act of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hand that dunks or pours is the hand of the minister, but the \nSpirit baptizes us into the one body (1 Cor 12:1213). When the rite \nis done, the baptized person isnt just wet. He or she is baptized, \nby God. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt every baptism, God himself preaches the good news of his Son. \nEvery baptized person is a fresh announcement of Gods promise, \ncommissioned to proclaim the good news.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism is more than an announcement. Its an effective announcement. \nChristians have always denied that baptism is a mere or empty sign. \nNo naked signs, Reformer John Calvin insists.8 As God preaches in \nbaptism, he makes the gospel visible, earthly, and real.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptized into one body\u0014\n\u0014\nLets think about this by considering circumcision. Yahweh told \nAbraham to circumcise the males of his household as bearers of \npromise (Gen 17:927). By circumcision and covenant, Abrahams family \nwas separated from the nations and promised gifts of land and seed, \nso that Abrahams family would eventually bless the nations (Gen \n12:13). At every circumcision, Israels vocation was inscribed in \nflesh.\u0014\n \u0014\nJesus fulfills Yahwehs promise to Abraham. He shatters the wall \nbetween Jew and gentile (Eph 2:1122) so that Gods blessing immerses \nthe nations. Baptism doesnt just picture what Jesus has done in \nuniting Jews and gentiles in one body. Baptism unites them. Every \nconverted Jew is washed; every converted gentile is washed. Every man \nis washed, and every woman. At baptism, the Spirit knits all peoples \ninto one body, blessed with the blessing of Abraham (Eph 4:46). The \ngood news of Jesus, who fulfills the promise to Abraham, comes true \nat every baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the same token, baptism doesnt announce a new priesthood \nsomewhere. It is an initiation rite for priests, and it forms the \npriesthood. Baptism doesnt just portray a new Israel following a new \nJoshua into battle; it musters the new-Israel army.9\u0014\nThrough baptism (and preaching, confession and absolution, the \nSupper, and the communion of saints), the gospel takes a local \nhabitation. Through baptism, salvation takes form as the Church. \nBaptism retunes discordant humanity. Every baptism proclaims good \nnews to the world and makes that good news real.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sign of baptism\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism is, of course, good news to baptized individualsthe good \nnews of forgiveness, cleansing, justification, sanctification, and \nglorification. For individuals, as for the world, baptism is a sign, \nbut its more than a sign. That more is often captured by the term \nseal.\u0014\n\u0014\nA seal is a mark of ownership and identity. None of us is autonomous. \nAs our very names attest, we all belong to someone. A seal tells us \nwho we are by telling us to whom we belong. Early Christians compared \nthe seal (Greek, sphragis) of baptism to a brand on an animal,11a \nmark on a slave,12 or a regimental tattoo on a Roman soldier.13 \nSealed with the Triune name, the baptized belongs to the Triune God. \nGod seals him or her as a member of the flock of God, a servant in \nthe Fathers house, a warrior under the command of King Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism tells us we dont belong to ourselves (1 Cor 6:1920), but it \ndoesnt merely tell us. It makes it so. In baptism, God redeems us \nfrom the devils prison to the free family of Jesus and raises us \nfrom the grave to resurrection life. Baptism is a transfer of \nownership from the world to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeals impose demands. Sheep must follow the shepherd. Slaves obey \ntheir master. Soldiers must be ready to fight and die. Seals are also \npromises. Good shepherds care for their sheep. Good masters love \ntheir slaves. Good generals provide for their troops. Sealed with \nbaptism, we are taken from the old and brought into the new. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs baptism announces the gospel, it plunges the baptized into the \nreality of the gospel. Because baptism seals, it saves, because \nbelonging to God is being saved.\u0014\n\u0014\n***\u0014\nIn Baptism: A Guide to Life from Death, a soul-stirring entry in the \nChristian Essentials series, Peter Leithart reunifies a Church \ndivided by baptism. In conversation with Scripture and Christian \ntradition, he explores the meaning of baptism and recovers the \nbaptismal imagination of the Bibleand shows how the waters of \nbaptism can unite us all.\u0014",

    "title": "BILLY GRAHAM'S VIEW OF HELL",
    "words": "Over the course of Grahams career, he talked less and less about \nhell until the end (of his career), when he barely mentioned it, \nWacker told the Charlotte Observer. Indeed, a Google search on Billy \nGraham and hell yields few results that are not related to the \nrecent book. Several articles that do turn up criticize the \nevangelist for soft-pedaling the idea. For example, The Baptist \nPillar (Canadas Only TRUE Baptist Paper) once stated that Billy \nGraham has declared his allegiance with the blasphemous apostasy of \nour day by preaching that hell might be more metaphorical than \nactual.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1983 sermon that roused the Baptist Pillars ire provides an \ninteresting comparison between spoken words that were indisputably \nGrahams, published words that were basically Grahams, and words \nthat appear in Where I Am. The published title of the sermon was, \nThere Is a Real Hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nThanks to Liberty Universitys archives, anyone can watch Graham \npreach this sermon to a large crowd in Sacramento, California. In it, \nGraham described hell as an unpopular, controversial, and \nmisunderstood subject. He continued, Ive heard some preachers \npreach on hell as though they were glad there was a hell and glad \nthat people were going there. But Im not. I dont like to preach on \nit. I do it only because Im commanded in Scripture to preach the \nword. And its against the backdrop of Gods love, mercy, and grace \nthat I must preach it. Regarding that backdrop, Graham stated, You \ncan never understand hell, though, until first you understand the \ngreat love, mercy, and grace of God, and it should never be preached \nby any preacher without tears. (Graham did not tear up at any point \non the video, though he described himself as speaking with a broken \nheart.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHell was not, Graham asserted, created for human beings, but for the \ndevil and his angels. Humans find themselves in hell when they reject \nGodand hell begins in this life, not in the next. According to \nGraham, The Bible teaches that there are at least three kinds of \nhell. The first, hell in the heart, is humanitys sinful nature, \npresent in children at birth and manifested as soon as they start \nmaking their own bad choices. Acting on this sinful nature can \nproduce a related hell of guilt, such as that experienced by a \nunnamed man whom Graham described as cheating on his wife. Impulses \nbubbling up from sinful nature can also produce a hell of unrest, \nthe sort of fruitless seeking for inner peace that, in Grahams view, \ndrove the Beatles to India.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecondly, according to Graham, theres hell around us. It appears \nas lust, greed, and hatred. It spawns wars and riots. Graham \nrepeatedly linked his thoughts on hell with his concerns about the \nstate of the world, at times paying more attention to the latter than \nthe former. He preached, A lady said sometime ago, I hate the very \nthought of hell. So do I! And I also hate the sin that sends them \nthere. I hate war. I hate the fact that people are starving in the \nworld. Unfortunately, Graham admitted, hating these things did not \nmake them go away.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the third kind of hell, hell in the future, was connected in \nGrahams sermon to present-day concerns. The future hell is a \nprojection of the hell that you have now in your heart, in your home, \nin our world, except it goes on and on, he said. Perhaps there would \nbe fire, smoke, and stench. Graham observed that Gary, Indiana, \nlooked a bit like hell if you peered down from an airplane. But \nperhaps hellfire was metaphorical. Graham mused, [Jesus] uses the \nword fire, and I have often wondered if that is a terrible fire \nwithin our hearts for God, for fellowship with God, that can never be \nquenched. Weve rejected God. Weve turned our back on God. We can \nnever know God.  [Hell is] the banishment from the presence of all \nthat is joyous and good and righteous and happy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe printed version of this sermon appeared in the July-August 1984 \nissue of the BGEA magazine Decision. The article, with Grahams \nbyline, began with the preachers reluctance to address the topic, \nstated that hell was created for the devil and his angels, described \nthe three kinds of hell, and speculated that the fire of hell was a \nburning in the heart for fellowship with God. Many of the words of \nthe article were exactly those Graham had preached. The article was, \nhowever, much shorter. It did not include the stories about the \ncheating husband, the Beatles, or flying over Gary, Indiana. It also \nskipped most references to the worlds problems and any reference to \ntears or a broken heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Elesha Coeman, November 2, 2015\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nA YouTube video critical of Graham includes footage of a 1997 \nconversation between the evangelist and Robert Schuller, in which \nGraham raises the possibility that people who do not even know Christ \nmight yet be saved. Similarly, he told Meacham in 2006 that it would \nbe foolish for him to speculate whether only Christians could get \nto heaven. I believe the love of God is absolute, Graham said then. \nHe said he gave his son for the whole world, and I think he loves \neverybody regardless of what label they have.\u0014",

    "title": "BISHOP BUTLER DIED IN BATH",
    "words": "Bishop Butler Died in Bath\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Butler was in Bath. He hoped that the natural hot springs \nwould do him good, for he was not feeling at all well. Just in case \nthe remedy should prove unsuccessful, he gave orders that his \nspeculative, unfinished manuscripts be burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Bishop of the Church of England, Butler had written the most famous \napologetic of his age. This was the Analogy of Religion, Natural and \nRevealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature. A religious \nphilosophy known as Deism agreed that God had made the world but \ndenied he had used prophets, visions, angels or revelations to teach \nmen about himself. Deists attacked the Bible, saying it had \nimperfections that proved it wasn't from the hand of God. Butler's \nbook was written to answer the Deists.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies earlier, the Greek theologian Origen had said, \"Those who \nbelieve the author of nature to be also the author of scripture must \nexpect to find in scripture the same sorts of difficulties that they \nfind in nature.\" Butler's Analogy used Origen's argument.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, a Deist might complain that scripture says God visits \nthe iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and \nfourth generation. How could that be fair? Butler replied that nature \ndoes the same thing. To give a modern example, a pregnant woman takes \nLSD. Her daughter is born with deformities and in turn she gives \nbirth to another defective child either because of carrying \nLSD-mutated genes or because of labor difficulties owing to her own \nmalformation. It was unreasonable to accept nature as coming from God \nbut to deny the revelation that affirmed the very principle that we \nsee in nature. The point is, our decisions do affect other people and \nso we should endeavor to make decisions that take into account the \ninterests of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is just what the scripture teaches, although it adds grace to \nthe equation--God often breaks the cycle of nature and sets things \nright. The natural equivalent of grace would be for the daughter or \ngrandchild to receive medical attention that corrects the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nButler argued that nature itself suggests man is immortal. Some \nthings make sense only if this life is a probationary period. The \nexistence of conscience is a strong support for the Christian claim \nthat there is a moral law, he said. The Analogy was a cool and \nreasoned piece of writing, so much so that Butler scarcely discussed \nsin or Hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid Butler get infected with the disease he was trying to cure? After \nhe met John Wesley, he condemned \"the pretending to extraordinary \nrevelations and gifts of the Holy Spirit\" as \"a horrid thing--a very \nhorrid thing.\" He also described revelation as a \"horrid thing,\" \nwhich seems a peculiar statement for a defender of Divine revelation \nto make! But, while acknowledging that the great doctrines of \nChristianity cannot be proven by philosophy, Butler showed that \nChristianity has enough probability to make its acceptance a \nreasonable response.\u0014\n\u0014\nButler died, after all, while at Bath, on this day, June 16, 1752. \nJust as he had requested, his manuscripts were burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBagehot, Walter.

    "words": "How this enslaved mans story could persuade more Black Americans to \nget vaccinated\u0014\nBy Clyde W. Ford Aug 23, 2021  Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Clyde W. Ford\u0014\n\u0014\nFewer than 25% of Black Americans have been fully vaccinated, the \nlowest vaccination rate of any group the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention tracks. This unacceptably low rate is the result of \nmany factors, including disproportionate representation in \nessential-worker settings, a lack of access to quality health care, \nand racism and associated chronic stress.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooming large in vaccination hesitancy among Blacks is distrust in \nAmerican health care rooted in medical racism and experimentation. \nThe many strategies employed in an attempt to overcome this distrust \nhave included ministers in the community spearheading vaccination \ncampaigns and Black health care professionals answering questions \nduring the pandemic about past medical malfeasance and current \nmedical practice.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne untried strategy that could make a difference: an information \ncampaign that would highlight how people of African descent have been \ncrucial to the development of vaccines in the U.S.  going back more \nthan 300 years. This strategy offers a source of pride instead of \nfear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe historical record shows that the very notion of inoculation \nagainst a virus first was introduced in early America by an enslaved \nAfrican man named Onesimus. In 1706, a Boston congregation gave him \nto their minister as a gift  thats right, churchgoing Christians \nthought it was perfectly fine to present another human being to their \nspiritual leader as a gift. The recipient was Cotton Mather, the \nacclaimed Puritan minister and author.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmallpox had been known and feared for some time when Onesimus told \nMather around 1716 about an inoculation method to prevent smallpox \nthat had been used on him as a child in Africa. Onesimus most likely \ncame from Ghana, which had been ruled by several Islamic dynasties, \nand Arabic medical science had developed several methods aimed at \npreventing smallpox by the 17th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Mather, Onesimus explained that scraping the skin of an \nuninfected person with a thorn dipped in juice from a smallpox \nvesicle of someone already infected could protect that person from \ndying. Mather struggled to accept a slaves wisdom. He verified this \nrecounting by speaking with other Africans, and with other ministers \nwho had heard similar reports from enslaved people they owned or \ninterviewed. Mather also learned that the inoculation method Onesimus \nhad described was common throughout the Middle East, the Far East and \nAfrica.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter to what then was called the Royal Society, Mather called \nOnesimus a pretty Intelligent Fellow. Mather soon became a believer \nin inoculation, advocating for it from his pulpit and in his \nwritings. This drew the ire of his fellow white Bostonians, who \nresented the idea that knowledge obtained from a so-called \nuneducated, uncivilized African could be useful.\u0014\n\u0014\nNewspapers inveighed against Mather. Ministers preached his \ndamnation. An explosive device was thrown through the window of his \nhome. Then, on May 26, 1721, the sailing ship Seahorse arrived in \nBoston harbor from the Caribbean, and Mather wrote in his diary: The \ngrievous Calamity of the Small-Pox has now entered the Town.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the epidemic spread from the ship to citizens in Boston, Mather \npartnered with Zabdiel Boylston, a physician, to administer vaccines \nvia Onesimus method. Boylston inoculated his son and his enslaved \nAfrican workers before inoculating other Bostonians. Only six of the \n242 people inoculated using Onesimus method died, a mortality rate \nof 1 in 40. Among those who had not undergone the procedure, the \nmortality rate was 1 in 7.\u0014\n\u0014\nLives were saved. Mather was vindicated. Boylston was lauded. The \nBoston inoculations helped pave the way for English physician Edward \nJenner, in 1796, to develop the smallpox vaccine, a similar but safer \ninoculation technique. The procedure was called vaccination because \ncowpox was used; in Latin, vacca means cow.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnesimus role largely was lost to history until 2016, when medical \nhistorians voted him one of the 100 Best Bostonians of All Time in \nBoston Magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe historical record also shows that enslaved people were the \nsubjects of vaccine experimentation. For example, in 1801 Thomas \nJefferson had 50 of those he enslaved at Monticello injected with a \nsmallpox vaccine, then daringly exposed them to the live smallpox \nvirus. Only after they showed no symptoms would he allow two dozen of \nhis family members to be vaccinated.\u0014\n\u0014\nA direct line can be drawn between inoculation in Boston in the early \n1700s and the COVID-19 vaccine today. For instance, the Pfizer and \nModerna vaccines use pieces of a virus genetic material (mRNA) to \ncreate an immune response.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Americans should rightly be suspicious of an American health \ncare system that has, through the centuries, treated them as \ndisposable laboratory rats. But by highlighting Onesimus role in the \ndevelopment of vaccines, public health officials might be able to \npersuade more Black Americans to roll up their sleeves and receive \nthe COVID-19 vaccine with pride, knowing the history of the injection \ntheyre receiving can be traced back to an enslaved African man.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nClyde W. Fords latest book is the forthcoming Of Blood and Sweat: \nBlack Lives, and the Making of White Power and Wealth. He is a \ncontributing opinion writer for the Los Angeles Times.\u0014",

    "title": "BIRMINGHAM BLAST: WHY CHILDREN?",
    "words": "Birmingham Blast: Why Children?\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was this day, Sunday, September 15, 1963. The place was 16th \nStreet Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. The lesson for the day \nwas, \"The Love that Forgives,\" based on Matthew 5:43, 44. \"You have \nheard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But \nI tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\" \nA prayer was to accompany the lesson: \"Dear God, we are sorry for the \ntimes we were unkind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lesson would prove to be grimly appropriate. But it was never \nfinished. At 9:22 A.M., before it could be completed, the church \nexploded.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen or fifteen sticks of dynamite planted under the back steps of the \nbuilding erupted with terrific force. The explosion hurled yellow \nbricks through cars, shattered nearby businesses and smashed a fist \nof terror through the church. The rest rooms at the rear of the \nchurch absorbed the brunt of the blast. Nonetheless, the shock was \nsufficient to collapse the church rafters, shred pews and shatter \nwindows. Members of this black congregation--wounded, bleeding, and \nblinded,--staggered into the street as rescue crews rushed to the \nscene. In place of hymns, screams and sobs and cries of protest \nfilled the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn angry mob of blacks gathered. Black ministers called on them to \npray for the men who had perpetrated this outrage. \"We must have love \nin our hearts for these men.\" But the anguish and bitterness of the \nmoment spoke louder. The mob began to pelt rescue workers and police \nwith stones as they dug into the rubble. Police fired over the head \nof the crowd to disperse them. Once again hatred prevailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBirmingham was no stranger to bombings. Since World War II, fifty had \nbeen directed against blacks. But none of the previous bombers had \nstruck against churches. Or targeted children.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, children were missing. Fears turned to stark reality as the \nwreckage was peeled aside from what had been the rest room. One man \nuncovered the remains of his own granddaughter. Torn and mangled \nbodies came to light: little bodies, the bodies of four girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley \ndied. Seventeen other people were wounded. The death toll could have \nbeen much higher. Four hundred people were in the church at the time. \nChrist could only have grieved. He taught us to love our neighbor as \nourselves, and yet the very churches built in his name were \nsegregated and subject to mindless violence as men battled for \npolitical control of a race-crazed city. One reporter noted that \nChrist's head in a stained glass window was blown off.\u0014\n\u0014\nKlansman Robert Chambliss was convicted of his part in the crime \nfourteen years after the blast. Two other conspirators, Tommy Blanton \nand Bobby Cherry were finally brought to justice in 2001 and 2002 \nrespectively.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nNews reports in Time, Newsweek and other news sources.\u0014\nSikora, Frank.

    "title": "BEZA, THE LAST OF THE GREAT REFORMERS",
    "words": "Beza, Last of the Great Reformers\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL 2010 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nEach day, two of Geneva's ministers came to check on Theodore Beza. \nThe old reformer was dearly loved and they were concerned for his \nfailing health. On this day, Sunday, October 13, 1605, the sick man \nfelt well enough to dress. Theodore asked his visitors, \"Is the city \nin full safety and quiet?\" He was assured that all was well. Moments \nlater, he lost all strength and collapsed to the floor. Friends \ngathered and prayed at his bedside as he passed peacefully away \nwithin a few minutes. The last of the great reformers was dead. His \nhad been a life of much sorrow, hard work and grueling adventure.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheodore Beza was born in Burgundy in 1519, the son of a county \nbailiff. His father had marked out one course for him, but it seemed \nGod had another. At nine years of age he was sent to study with a \nfamous Greek scholar Melchior Wolmar. Wolmar's sympathy with the \nLutherans rubbed off on his pupil. What fruit this would bear was not \nyet apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeza's father wanted him to become a lawyer and Beza did the \npreliminary studies. However, he preferred literary studies and \nconvinced his father to allow him to switch fields. He became honored \nas a Latin poet and wit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough family connections, he received church benefices to live on. \nMeanwhile, like many clergymen of the day, he contracted a secret \nmarriage. His wife was Claudine Denosse. Then Beza fell dangerously \nill. As he lay in bed, he realized that he was a hypocrite, taking \nmoney from the Roman Church while secretly married and at heart a \nProtestant. As soon as he recovered sufficiently to do so, he fled \nfrom France with his wife, leaving behind fame and fortune.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalse starts aren't all bad. His wit remained with him throughout his \nlife. Appealing to the king of Navarre, he once said, \"Sire, it is in \ntruth the lot of the Church of God, in whose name I am speaking, to \nendure blows, and not to strike them. But also may it please you to \nremember that it is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClaudine was one of the deepest joys of his life. Their marriage \nlasted until her death forty years later. Theodore himself became a \nleading Huguenot theologian, and eventually Calvin's successor as \nleader of the Swiss Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his long life he risked dangerous journeys again and again \ninto Catholic France, even traveling by night to escape detection. On \nthese trips he was in danger from Judas friends. Yet he argued the \nProtestant case before great theologians and political leaders. On \noccasion he accompanied Huguenot armies and preached for them. Using \nthe diplomatic skills honed during his upbringing, he visited the \nProtestant courts of Europe to win support for the suffering French \nProtestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notice of his death read, \"What the haven is to those that sail, \nthat is the removal into another life to those whose death is \nprecious in the eyes of the Lord.\" All were \"invited, in the name of \nthe pastors and professors, today at noon, to pay this last honor due \nto so great a man and one that has died in so pious a manner and \nattend his funeral...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaird, Henry Martyn.

    "title": "BURNING OF LOLLARDS IN ENGLAND",
    "words": "Between 14501517, Lollardy was almost wholly restricted to the rural \ndistricts, and little mention is made of it in contemporary records. \nAt Amersham, one of its centres, four were tried in 1462, and some \nsuffered death, as William Barlowe in 1466, and John Goose a few \nyears later. In 1507, three were burnt there, including William \nTylsworth, the leading man of the congregation. At the crucial moment \nhe was deserted by the members, and sixty of them joined in carrying \nfagots for his burning. This time of recantation continued to be \nknown in the district as the Great Abjuration. The first woman to \nsuffer martyrdom in England, Joan Broughton, was burnt at Smithfield, \n1494, as was also her daughter, Lady Young. Nine Lollards made public \npenance at Coventry, 1486, but, as late as 1519, six men and one \nwoman suffered death there. Foxe also mentions William Sweeting and \nJohn Brewster as being burnt at Smithfield, 1511, and John Brown at \nAshford the same year. How extensively Wyclifs views continued to be \nsecretly held and his writings read is a matter of conjecture. Not \ntill 1559 was the legislation directed against Lollardy repealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere seems to have been agreement among the Lollards in denying the \nmaterial presence of Christ in the eucharistic bread and in \ncondemning pilgrimages, the worship of images and auricular \nconfession. They also held to the right of the people to read the \nScriptures in their own tongue.642 The expression, Gods law, was \nwidely current among them, and was opposed to the canon law and the \ndecisions of the Church courts. Some denied purgatory, and even based \ntheir salvation on faith,643 the words, \"Thy faith hath saved thee,\" \nbeing quoted for this view. Some denied that the marriage bond was \ndependent upon the priests act, and more the scriptural warrant and \nexpediency of priestly celibacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLollardy was an anticipation of the Reformation of the sixteenth \ncentury, and did something in the way of preparing the mind of the \nEnglish people for that change. Professed by many clerics, it was \nemphatically a movement of laymen. In the early Reformation period, \nEnglish Lutherans were at times represented as the immediate \nfollowers of Wyclif. Writing in 1523 to Erasmus, Tonstall, bishop of \nLondon, said of Lutheranism that \"it was not a question of some \npernicious novelty, but only that new arms were being added to the \ngreat band of Wycliffite heretics.\u0014",

One of those \nrepresentations is of an African girl, Manchi Masemola. (Her first \nname is often spelled Manche, but the family prefers Manchi.)\u0014\n\u0014\nMasemola was born into the Pedi tribe of South Africa around 1913. \nChristian missionaries had brought the gospel to the region in the \neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A minority of the Pedi accepted \nthe new faith but it was distrusted by the majority who held the \nancient tribal religion and considered Christianity treasonous \nbecause of its association with the colonialists. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1919, Augustine Moeka, an Anglican priest, established a mission \nat Marishane in behalf of the Anglican Community of the Resurrection. \nMasemola began attending baptismal classes with her orphaned cousin \nLucia. Fearful that she would not be marriageable and thus not bring \nthem a dowry, her parents demanded she quit the classes. Each time \nshe defied them, they beat her. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn part their severity may have been because class attendance took \nher away from field work for a few hours. The beatings became so \nsevere she predicted she would be killedand baptized in her own \nblood. To keep Masemola from attending classes, her mother took her \nclothes. When this did not prevent her following Christ, her parents \nbrought her to a spiritist who prepared a concoction they compelled \nher to drink. Masemola, however, would not be dissuaded from her \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe end was not far off. As the story has long been told, on or \naround this day, 4 February 1928, Masemolas parents killed her and \nburied her beside a granite rock. Lucia confirmed this account. \nHowever, Masemolas mother, who became a Christian in 1969, denied \nthe charge of murder; and Masemolas father planted euphorbia trees \nin remembrance of Masemola and a younger sister who died about the \nsame time. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut beyond dispute, Masemola suffered severely for Christ. She was \nprobably fifteen when she died. Her ordeal was not without fruit. In \n1935, people began to visit her grave. Over subsequent years a \nmovement grew to honor her memory. Today pilgrims visit her grave \nannually on the first weekend of August. They hear a sermon that \nencourages them to walk in faith like Masemola.\u0014",

Then, we worked closely with a midwife who \nprepared us to confidently labor alone (together) in our home. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen labor began at 5am, we prepared our home for your birth: we \nmoved our cars out of the driveway; we hung a sign outside for our \nmidwife; we gathered blankets and a pot for herbs, lit candles. The \nsunroom was where you were to be born and we filled the space with \nsoftness and warmth. We designated a place for the birth and a place \nto rest immediately following your birth. We dimmed all of the lights \nand turned on soft music and drew a bath. And then, we labored. \nQuietly. Beautifully. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur midwife called to check on us each hour and she could tell by my \nbreathing how well we were doing. We continued on. Quietly. \nBeautifully. There wasnt a single fear in the space. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen our midwife joined us, we discovered our first surprise you \ndesigned for us: you were coming out bottom first! At 8 cm with \ncontractions coming fast, my midwife dressed me and we all drove to \nthe hospital for no reason other than we wanted to be extra safe in \nresponse to your little positioning surprise! \u0014\n\u0014\nWe arrived at 5pm12 hours after labor beganand then you were born \n(vaginal, unmedicated, frank breech) at 7:21pm. You didnt cry much \nat all; instead you were ready to cuddle. And then eat! You latched \nquickly, beautifully while the students who watched your birth (to \nlearn from it) thanked us (already a teacher).\u0014\n\u0014\nYou were strong right away; curious right away.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour birth went exactly as planned because our plan was only to go \nwith the ease and flow. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou did great work during your birth!

In many (some may say most) circumstances, a \nbreech baby would mean immediate C-section, but you held in there and \ndid the work with your dad and me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is still one of my most treasured days.

It has taken so many women traveling the road \nbefore me and then reaching back to check on me, encourage me, teach \nme that I feel it's hard to pin down where my own woman-ness started \nand theirs left off. Some days, I think the delineation matters \nnaught.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then there are decisions my own mother heart has made, held up by \nthe supporting arms of my husband and resourced by my the women who \ntaught me the \"how\" of it all. Those decisions that my husband and I \nhold dear include our planned home birth and breastfeeding.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere isn't a single room in our home that doesn't resonate with the \nmemory of our laboring; as I labored, my husband prepared our home: \nhe moved around furniture, drew a bath; created a place for the birth \nand then a nest for recovery; prepared food to nurture the bodies in \nour home--mine, our baby's, our in-home medical providers. We still \nfeel the intimacy and empowerment of that decision reverberating \nthrough our shared love and space.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then breastfeeding, a decision I'm so glad I made and stuck to, \nand I'm thankful my body (resourced by community support) has been \nproducing. The non-verbal closeness and the connection breastfeeding \nhas gifted my son and me is precious to me. \u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes it's hard to feel proud of decisions you've made without \nworrying you're possibly offending or hurting someone else who made \ndifferent decisions. But if there's anything birth work has taught me \nit's that everyone makes decisions based on their comfort levels, \ncircumstances and needs, and I understand how beautiful and how \nchallenging variances of normal can be.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, though, I still find lasting, lasting (continuously lasting) \nbeauty in the decisions we've made for our family.

    "words": "Billy Graham Took a Bombshell\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nFor two years Billy Graham planned a Greater London Crusade, to kick \noff March 1st, 1954. This crusade was the greatest test of his \nministry up to that point. The British were suspicious of the Yank \nand his \"hot gospel.\" An Anglican Bishop predicted Billy would return \nto American with his tail between his legs. Even backers were uneasy. \nNothing could shake spiritually-dull England, they thought. Hold the \nCrusade in outlying regions first, they urged, and test the waters. \nGraham refused. God did not need a pilot program.\u0014\n\u0014\nDifficulties mounted. The crusade committee had trouble booking an \nauditorium. They finally settled on Harringay arena, which speakers \nhad seldom been able to fill two nights in a row. Funds were short. \nDuring the crusade Billy and his coworkers took pay cuts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times Billy faltered. \"To go to London for a campaign is indeed \nfrightening and humbling. If anything is done for Christ, it will \nhave to be the Lord's doing.\" Bob Jones, Sr. accused Billy of going \nout of pride.\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly sailed for England. Aboard ship on this day, February 22, 1954, \nhe was handled a telegram. \"A Labor Member of Parliament announced \ntoday that he would challenge in Commons the admission of Billy \nGraham to England on the grounds the American evangelist was \ninterfering in British politics under the guise of religion.\" This \nwas referring to the fact that a Crusade brochure had mentioned the \nwoes brought on by Socialism. The Labor Party took it as an attack.\u0014\n\u0014\nLondon media demanded Graham's scalp. Lukewarm supporters \nbackpedalled. Momentarily, Graham felt the crusade was ruined. Yet \nGod had led him this far: he would go on. Meanwhile he sent an \napology. When he disembarked in Britain he was mobbed by hostile \nreporters; he said he believed God was going to pour out revival upon \nEngland. As he passed through customs, an agent thanked him for \ncoming. So did a cab driver. Billy's spirits lifted.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless he was all nerves before the first meeting, shaking like \na leaf. He spent the day on his knees. A senator called to withdraw \nhis promised attendance. Someone rang to announce that only 2,000 \npeople had showed up to the 11,000 seat arena. Again Billy dropped to \nhis knees.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe negative publicity proved to be a blessing, however. The arena \nwas jammed for three months. Wherever Billy went he was mobbed by \nfriendly crowds. His team had to schedule extra meetings. Over two \nmillion people attended. Thousands came to Christ. Londoners sang \nhymns in the subways. Winston Churchill met Billy and heard the \ngospel in private. That London crusade did much to establish Mr. \nGraham's international ministry, which continued to expand over the \nnext four decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nPollock, John.

    "words": "Jeremy was born with a twisted body and a slow mind. At the \nage of 12 he was still in second grade, seemingly unable to learn. \nHis teacher, Doris Miller, often became exasperated with him. He \nwould squirm in his seat, drool, and make grunting noises. At other \ntimes, he spoke clearly and distinctly, as if a spot of light had \npenetrated the darkness of his brain. Most of the time, however, \nJeremy just irritated his teacher.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOne day she called his parents and asked them to come in for a \nconsultation. As the Forresters entered the empty classroom, Doris \nsaid to them, \"Jeremy really belongs in a special school. It isn't \nfair to him to be with younger children who don't have learning \nproblems. Why, theres a five year gap between his age and that of \nthe other students.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMrs. Forrester cried softly into a tissue, while her husband spoke. \n\"Miss Miller,\" he said, \"theres no school of that kind nearby. It \nwould be a terrible shock for Jeremy if we had to take him out of \nthis school. We know he really likes it here.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tDoris sat for a long time after they had left, staring at the snow \noutside the window. Its coldness seemed to seep into her soul. She \nwanted to sympathize with the Forresters. After all, their only child \nhad a terminal illness. But it wasn't fair to keep him in her class. \nShe had 18 other youngsters to teach, and Jeremy was a distraction. \nFurthermore, he would never learn to read and write. Why waste any \nmore time trying?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAs she pondered the situation, guilt washed over her. Here I am \ncomplaining when my problems are nothing compared to that poor \nfamily. Lord, please help me to be more patient with Jeremy. From \nthat day on, she tried hard to ignore Jeremy's noises and his blank \nstares. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThen one day, he limped to her desk, dragging his bad leg behind \nhim. \"I love you, Miss Miller,\" he exclaimed, loud enough for the \nwhole class to hear. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe other students snickered, and Doris' face turned red. She \nstammered, \"Wh-why that's very nice, Jeremy. N-now please take your \nseat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSpring came, and the children talked excitedly about the coming of \nEaster. Doris referred to the story of Jesus, and then to emphasize \nthe idea of new life springing forth, she gave each of the children a \nlarge plastic egg. \"Now,\" she said to them, \"I want you to take this \nhome and bring it back tomorrow with something inside that shows new \nlife. Do you understand?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\"Yes, Miss Miller,\" the children responded enthusiastically-all \nexcept for Jeremy. He listened intently; his eyes never left her \nface. He didnt even make his usual noises. Had he understood what \nshe had said? Did he understand the assignment? Perhaps she should \ncall his parents and explain the project to them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThat evening, Doris' kitchen sink stopped up. She had to shop for \ngroceries, iron a blouse, and prepare a vocabulary test for the next \nday. She completely forgot about phoning Jeremy's parents.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe next morning, 19 children came to school, laughing and talking \nas they placed their eggs in the large wicker basket on Miss Miller's \ndesk. After they completed their math lesson, it was time to open the \neggs. In the first egg, Doris found a flower. \"Oh yes, a flower is \ncertainly a sign of new life,\" she said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe next egg contained a plastic butterfly, which looked very real. \nDoris held it up. \"We all know that a caterpillar changes and grows \ninto a beautiful butterfly. Yes, that's new life, too.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tNext, Doris found a rock with moss on it. She explained that moss, \ntoo, showed life. Billy spoke up from the back of the classroom, \"My \ndaddy helped me,\" he beamed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThen Doris opened the fourth egg. She gasped. The egg was empty. \nSurely it must be Jeremy's she thought, and of course, he didnt \nunderstand her instructions. If only she had not forgotten to phone \nhis parents. Because she didnt want to embarrass him, she quietly \nset the egg aside and reached for another. Suddenly, Jeremy spoke up. \n\"Miss Miller, aren't you going to talk about my egg?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tFlustered, Doris replied, \"But Jeremy, your egg is empty.\" He looked \ninto her eyes and said softly, \"Yes, but Jesus' tomb was empty, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tTime stopped. When she could speak again, Doris asked him, \"Do you \nknow why the tomb was empty?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\t\"Oh, yes,\" Jeremy said, \"Jesus was killed and put in there, but God \nraised Him up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe recess bell rang. While the children excitedly ran out to the \nschool yard, Doris cried. The cold inside her melted completely away.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThree months later, Jeremy died. Those who came to pay their \nrespects at the mortuary were surprised to see 19 eggs on top of his \ncasket, all of them empty. What had he really said to the other \nchildren?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYes, Jeremy, the tomb was empty, but thats not the whole story \neither. Turn the viewfinder just a tad, and there is something more. \nBecause that tomb was empty, the believer can say, Beyond that tomb \nthere is new life, life everlasting, and thats the biggest news the \nworld has ever heard. And if I could, I would like to say to Jeremy, \nYou got it right, son; you got it right, and thats why we can sing:\u0014\n\u0014\n\t      Because he lives I can face tomorrow,\u0014\n               Because he lives all fear is gone;\u0014\n               Because I know he holds the future,\u0014\n               And life is worth the living\u0014\n               Just because he lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Easter is for those who have been to the cemetery and saw \nsomething else.\u0014",

    "title": "BOARDING SCHOOL DEATHS COUNTED FOR THE FIRST TIME",
    "words": "U.S. Counts Boarding School Deaths For the First Time But Has a Long \nWay to Go\u0014\nBy Graham Lee Brewer  is a national reporter for NBC News  MAY 11, \n2022\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least 500 Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian \nchildren died while attending Indian boarding schools run or \nsupported by the U.S. government, a highly anticipated Interior \nDepartment report said Wednesday. The report identified over 400 \nschools and more than 50 gravesites and said more gravesites would \nlikely be found.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report is the first time in U.S. history that the government has \nattempted to comprehensively research and acknowledge the magnitude \nof the horrors it inflicted on Native American children for decades. \nBut it falls well short of some independent estimates of deaths and \ndoes not address how the children died or who was responsible. The \nreport also sheds little new light on the physical and sexual abuse \ngenerations of Indigenous children endured at the schools, which were \nopen for more than 150 years, starting in the early 1800s. \u0014\n\u0014\nInterior Department report finds over 500 Native children died in \nboarding school system\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report and an accompanying news release acknowledge the harms to \nIndigenous children but stop short of offering an apology from the \nfederal government, which tribal leaders have been requesting for \ndecades. Last month, Pope Francis apologized for the Roman Catholic \nChurchs role in Canadas boarding school system, and First Nation \nleaders there are asking him to apologize in person when he visits \nthe country this summer. \u0014\n\u0014\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland's grandparents were both 8 years old \nwhen they were forced to attend boarding school, she said Wednesday \nat a news conference. Many children like them never made it back to \ntheir homes. Each of those children is a missing family member, a \nperson who was not able to live out their purpose on this Earth \nbecause they lost their lives as part of this terrible system, \nHaaland said, holding back tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trauma caused by federal Indian boarding school policies  \nincluding the separation of children as young as 4 years old from \ntheir families  dates back generations and is ongoing, Halaand said. \nThe report is the first step toward understanding what assistance \npeople need to overcome that trauma, she said, including mental \nhealth services and language revitalization, since children were \nabused and forbidden from speaking their native languages at the \nschools.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Even though its ceased or stopped in many places, the vestiges of \nit is still continuing today,\" said James LaBelle, Sr., who is \nInupiaq and a vice president of the National Native American Boarding \nSchool Healing Coalition, a nonprofit that helped compile the report \nand advocates for survivors of Indian boarding schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report identified more than 500 child deaths after examining \nrecords for 19 of the facilities, a small share of the total number \nof schools identified. As the investigation continues, the \nDepartment expects the number of recorded deaths to increase, it \nstates. The number is significantly less than some estimates, which \nare in the tens of thousands. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States doesnt even know how many Indian students went \nthrough these institutions  let alone how many actually died in \nthem, said Preston S. McBride, an Indian boarding school historian \nand a Comanche descendent. McBride has found more than 1,000 student \ndeaths at the four former boarding schools he has studied, and \nestimates the overall number of deaths could be as high as 40,000.\u0014\nBasically every school had a cemetery, he said. There are deaths \nat or deaths because of virtually every single boarding school.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose deaths were the result of everything from illness to abuse, \nMcBride said, based on his review of historical records, including \nletters written by students, parents and administrators. Getting to \nthe true number would take a significant amount of time and research, \nMcBride said. I think we have a long way to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report notes the investigation will likely \"reveal the \napproximate number of Indian children who died at Federal Indian \nboarding schools to be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Interior Departments investigation located 53 gravesites across \nthe country  a number that is also expected to increase  but did \nnot name the schools to prevent well-documented grave-robbing, \nvandalism, and other disturbances to Indian burial sites.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaaland, a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American \nto lead the department, announced the investigation last June. It is \nintended to provide a basis for how the U.S. government will reckon \nwith its troubling history by researching and locating potential \ngravesites, repatriating childrens remains and offering resources \nand access to the affected Indigenous communities to address the \nongoing impact of the boarding schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssistant Secretary of the Interior Bryan Newland, who led the \ninvestigation and is a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community \n(Ojibwe), said most of the staff who worked on the report for the \ndepartment are Indigenous.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir work has helped place the Indian boarding school system in its \nhistorical, legal and policy context, he said, Its been an \nexhausting and emotional effort for them to confront this horror on a \ndaily basis to bring this information to you, Newland said at the \nnews conference, pausing several times to collect himself. This has \nleft lasting scars for all Indigenous people. Theres not a single \nAmerican Indian, Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian in this country \nwhose life hasnt been affected by these schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaginaw Chippewa tribe uncovers death records of 227 Indigenous \nchildren\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in the early 1800s, the U.S. government stole Native \nAmerican children from their communities and forced them to attend \nIndian boarding schools, where they were stripped of their languages \nand traditions, given English names and trained to perform military \ndrills. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report found 408 schools in 37 states that were established from \n1801 to 1969 and received funding or other forms of support from the \nfederal government. Half of them also received support from religious \ninstitutions or organizations, including funding, infrastructure, \nand personnel, the report found. Many of the religious institutions \nwere also paid by the government for each Indigenous child they \nplaced in the boarding school system.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report found that the U.S. government targeted Indigenous \nchildren as part of its efforts to assimilate them and dispossess \ntheir tribal nations of land, and it lays out the history of that \nmethod, developed largely by Thomas Jefferson. While the history may \nbe new to many Americans, it is familiar to many in Indian Country. \nSurvivors and their families have documented countless examples of \nsystemic abuse and generational trauma, as some of the schools \nremained open into the 1990s.\u0014\n\u0014\nA memorial outside the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in \nBritish Columbia on July 15. A search of the property using \nground-penetrating radar found the remains of 215 children buried \nnear the former school. Darryl Dyck / Canadian Press via AP\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report, which is intended to be a first step, includes a \nrecommendation for a continuing investigation and additional funding. \nOther recommendations include creating a repository for the \ninformation gathered from federal agencies and private institutions \nand providing more funding for the Native American Graves Protection \nand Repatriation Act, the federal law that regulates the repatriation \nof Indigenous remains. \u0014\nWhile the report acknowledges an era of violence perpetrated on \nNative American children, it does not ensure that the government will \ntake any immediate steps to address the devastation left by its \npolicies. The report notes that the federal government has never \nprovided a forum for survivors or their descendants to voluntarily \ndetail their experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report is just a first step and only scratches the surface of the \nboarding school-era's legacy, Haaland said. She will be conducting a \nyear-long tour of Indian Country to give survivors the opportunity to \nshare their stories and create a permanent oral history, she said, as \nwell as connect them with trauma-informed support.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Canada, following the establishment of a truth and reconciliation \ncommission, the government recently set aside $4.7 billion to support \nIndigenous communities affected by its residential schools. The U.S. \nhas no similar commission. Congress has provided $7 million to the \nDepartment of Interior for its investigation, Newland said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo measures before Congress could change that. Bills by Sen. \nElizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., a citizen \nof the Ho-Chunk Nation, would create a truth and reconciliation \ncommission on Indian boarding schools, offering a framework for how \nthe government responds to the tribal nations and citizens its \npolicies have negatively affected. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe House Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on the \nlegislation Thursday, and boarding school survivors can submit \ntestimony about their experiences until May 26. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if the measures pass, they would still leave open legal \nloopholes that limit the governments ability to investigate the \nhistory of boarding schools, including an exemption that allows some \nreligious organizations to opt out. The Native American Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act applies only to land that is under \nfederal control or institutions that receive federal funding. The \ngovernment has little control over gravesites on private land and \nrecords held by private organizations  like the Catholic Church, \nwhich operated several Indian boarding schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report does not address that issue, but it does recommend that \nthe second phase of the investigation compile a list of organizations \nthat supported and benefited from the Indian boarding school system. \nAnd it recommends consultation with tribes for the reclamation and \nco-management of burial sites. Still, the recommendations do not \ninclude a clear path to action. \u0014\n\u0014\nSurvivors are long overdue a formal apology from the U.S., said \nSamuel Torres, deputy CEO of the National Native American Boarding \nSchool Healing Coalition. If and when it comes, he said, it needs to \nbe followed up with action.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the federal government really wants to be a part of a truth \nspeaking, of an accountability process, and wants to be able to lay a \nfoundation to be able to open up pathways towards healing, nows the \ntime.\"\u0014",

The report, produced by a third-party investigator and \ntotaling almost 300 pages, alleges that the denominations top \nleaders had suppressed reports of sexual abuse, opposed proposals for \nreform, and denigrated and discouraged abuse victims who approached \nthem for help.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the reports most shocking revelations was the existence of an \ninternal list of 703 people suspected of abuse, compiled by an \nemployee of the denominations executive committee, its national \nleadership body.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the report, an executive committee staff member compiled \nand maintained the list over the course of a decade and shared it \nwith D.

The hotline will be functional as soon \nas Wednesday morning, Mr. Besen said in an interview.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Besen announced in the meeting that the committees leadership is \nalso looking into whether it has the authority to revoke Mr. Botos \nretirement benefits.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe creation of an Offender Information System was one of the new \nreports primary recommendations.

That year an investigation by \nThe Houston Chronicle and The San Antonio Express-News revealed that \nnearly 400 Southern Baptist leaders, from youth pastors to top \nministers, had pleaded guilty or been convicted of sex crimes against \nmore than 700 victims since 1998.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrista Brown maintained her own list of some 170 credibly accused \nclergy sex abusers.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrista Brown, who has pushed for changes in how the denomination \nhandles abuse cases, maintained her own public list of some 170 \ncredibly accused Southern Baptist ministers.

    "title": "BECKETT BECAME ARCHBISHOP",
    "words": "BECKET BECAME ARCHBISHOP\u0014\n \u0014\nThomas  Becket had been a successful warrior, archdeacon, and \nchancellor of England when his friend King Henry II tapped him to \nbecome archbishop of Canterbury. Becket may have been reluctant to \naccept the position, knowing that Henry found ways to divert church \nrevenues to the throne. He had helped Henry in at least one such \nscheme and knew that as archbishop he would feel obliged to resist \nthe kings practices. Confrontation with Henry would be inevitable. \nHe remarked that if appointed he must forfeit either the favor of God \nor of the king.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless Cardinal Henry of Pisa, the popes legate, urged Becket \nto accept the position. The monks of Christchurch had first to elect \nhim, which they promptly did. As he was only in minor orders, he \nneeded to become a priest first. Bishop Walter of Rochester ordained \nhim to the priesthood in Canterbury. On the following day, Trinity \nSunday, 3 June 1162, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, \nconsecrated Becket archbishop of Canterbury, with the assistance of \nthirteen other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost at once Becket surprised the king by resigning the \nchancellorship, thus establishing his independence. He also seized \nback church lands the church had forfeited. Everything that had ever \nbeen given to the Church was to be claimed, while nothing that had \nbeen parted with was to be abandoned, wrote James Craigie Robertson.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot quite a year after his elevation to archbishop, Becket made \nanother significant challenge to Henry when he sided with Englands \nsheriffs against a taxation scheme that would have upset \nlong-standing traditions. He rejected the king of Englands \ndetermination to punish clergy who committed crimes, saying such \ncases must be tried in church courts. Henry was furious because the \nclergy were committing murders, robberies, and other violent crimes \nwith virtual impunity. The archbishop based his position in part on \nthe False Decretals (spurious canons).\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1164 Henry was demanding that the bishops and barons condemn \nBecket as insubordinate to him, his feudal lord. Although Becket \nforbade the bishops from judging him, they did condemn him. Becket \nfled to France where he remained until 1170, issuing excommunications \nwhen his commands and claims were violated, much to the chagrin of \nthe pope who instructed the two sides to make peace. Meanwhile Becket \noften relieved beggars and washed their feet.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing and archbishop finally came to an arrangement. Becket sailed for \nEngland, where hordes met him, covering his path with their clothes \nand chanting, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. \nBecket proceeded to excommunicate some bishops who had participated \nin the coronation of Prince Henry, son of the king. Talebearers \nfalsely reported to the king that Becket had gathered a large force \nand was besieging towns.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutraged, the king complained that no one had relieved him of the \nproblematic archbishop. Four of Henrys knights immediately left to \ndo so. The clash between a king who was insincere and often violated \nhis promises, and an archbishop who was harsh and haughty, ended on \n29 December 1170, after the four knights entered the cathedral and \nexchanged angry words with Becket. The archbishop could have escaped, \nbut refused to do so. His opponents tried to drag him out of the \nchurch, but Becket and his cross-bearer Edward Grim held them off. \nBecket called Reginal Fitzurse a pander (which had the connotation \nof a pimp). Stung by the insult, Fitsurse struck the prelate. Becket \ndied in front of the altar. He died bravely: I am ready to die for \nmy Lord, that in my blood the Church may obtain liberty and peace. \nBut in the name of Almighty God I forbid you to hurt my people \nwhether clerk or lay.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy his death, which shocked the Christian world, Becket made it \npossible for Pope Alexander to win from Henry a number of concessions \nthe archbishop had demanded. The people immediately considered Becket \na saint, especially when it became known that at his death he was \nwearing both a hair shirt and underpants, crawling with vermin. Three \nyears later he was canonized. Henry was compelled to do penance at \nBeckets shrine which became the most-visited shrine in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nJune 3, 1162\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas  Becket is consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury. In this \ncapacity he will trouble his former friend King Henry II and be \nassassinated by four of Henrys knights on 29 December 1170.\u0014",

    "title": "BRAINERD DID MORE IN 29 YEARS THAN MOST CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "BRAINERD DID MORE IN TWENTY-NINE YEARS THAN MOST CHRISTIANS IN A \nHUNDRED\u0014\n \u0014\nDavid Brainerd lived only twenty-nine years, but his faith was \nresponsible for two major events. He helped trigger the formation of \nPrinceton University (as the College of New Jersey) and converted \nmany Seneca and Delaware Indians to Christianity. His journal and \ndiary also had a powerful influence after his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1718, he began to seek the Lord at the age of seven. But not \nuntil he was twenty-one did he have a new inward apprehension or \nview of God that propelled him to deep acts of faith. He enrolled in \nYale to study for the ministry but never received his degree. A \nfellow student accused him of saying one teacher had no more grace \nthan a chair. Brainerd admitted making that remark but denied any \nrecollection of another comment attributed to him. The school \nrejected his response as unsatisfactory, both then and when he later \noffered a more complete apology. Three professors who took Brainerds \nside resigned in disgust. They were among those who helped found the \nCollege of New Jersey.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scotland Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was \nnot put off by Brainerds lack of a degree. They commissioned him to \ncarry the gospel to American Indians. The first three years of that \nwork resulted in little fruit. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill he persevered. On this day, 12 June 1744, the New Jersey \npresbytery ordained David Brainerd. He wrote in his diary, \u0014\nAt this time I was affected with a sense of the important trust \ncommitted to me; yet composed and solemn, without distraction. I hope \nI then, (as many times before) gave up myself to God, to be for him, \nand not for another. Oh that I might always be engaged in his \nservice, duly remembering the solemn charge I have received, in the \npresence of God, angels, and men. Amen. May I be assisted of God for \nthis purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Pemberton, who officiated at the ceremony wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can with pleasure say, that Mr Brainerd passed through his \nordination-trials, to the universal approbation of the presbytery, \nand appeared uncommonly qualified for the work of the ministry. He \nseems to be armed with a great deal of self-denial, and animated with \na noble zeal to propagate the gospel among those barbarous nations, \nwho have long dwelt in the darkness of Heathenism.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrainerds years of fatigues and hardships paid off in 1745. His \ndiary and journal record a number of instances in which the Spirit of \nGod moved individuals and groups to repentance. Soon he was baptizing \nas many as fourteen at a time. Brainerd had just one more year of \ngood work left in him. In 1747, he became too ill to continue and \nrode to Jonathan Edwardss home where he was engaged to one of \nEdwardss daughters. They never married. After five months of \ndecline, Brainerd died of tuberculosis.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants such as Henry Martyn and William Carey found in \nBrainerds journal an inspiration to their own mission work.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "BISHOP JOHN FISHER BEHEADED",
    "words": "Bishop John Fisher Beheaded\u0014\n \u0014\nTHIS YEAR also on 17 June was arraigned at Westminster in the kings \nbench John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, for treason against the \nking, wrote Edward Hall, a lawyer who chronicled the reign of King \nHenry VIII. Fishers treason was to deny that the king was Supreme \nHead of the Church of England, a position Parliament had ratified as \nlaw in the Act of Supremacy. Consequently, the Catholic bishop was \ncondemned to be hanged and cut down alive, to have his intestines \ndrawn out of his body and burned before him, to have his head cut off \nand his body divided into four parts to be set in such places as the \nking should choose.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Henry VIII had originally appointed Fisher as Bishop of \nRochester because of his learning, sanctity, and Christian devotion. \nContent with a small diocese, Fisher refused advancement to larger \nsees such as Lincoln and Ely. Afterward he became Chancellor of \nCambridge College, where he revitalized the curriculum and imported \nErasmus from the continent to teach Greek. (Erasmus described Fisher \nas incomparable for uprightness of life, for learning, and for \ngreatness of soul.) As was usual for educated people of the day, \nFisher wrote most of his works in Latin, although a few sermons and \nhis Seven Penitential Psalms are in English.\u0014\n \u0014\nFisher wanted to reform the Catholic Church from within. One of the \nmeans he employed was to send priests throughout the realm preaching \nin English so the common people could understand. However, he wanted \nno part of the Protestant Reformation, rejecting Luthers writings \nand condemning the reformer John Barnes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his own trial he pleaded that his actions and words were not \nmalicious. After an intimidated jury found him guilty, the presiding \njudge asked him if he had anything more to say. He replied, If that \nwhich I have before spoken be not sufficient, I have no more to say, \nbut only to desire God to forgive them that have thus condemned me, \nfor I think they know not what they have done.\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Henry pardoned Fisher from the cruelest details of his sentence. \nOn this day, 22 June 1535, he was beheaded without the other \ntortures. Thomas Bailey, Fishers biographer, attributed the \nfollowing last words to him:\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian people, I am come hither to die for the faith of Christs \nholy catholick church and I thank God hitherto my stomach hath served \nme very well thereunto, so that yet I have not feared death: \nwherefore I desire you all to help and assist with your prayers, that \nat the very point and instant of deaths stroke, I may in that very \nmoment stand steadfast, without fainting in any one point of the \ncatholick faith, free from any fear. And I beseech Almighty God, of \nhis infinite goodness to save the king and this realm; and that it \nmay please him to hold his hand over it, and send the king good \ncouncil [sic].\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Fisher had recited two psalms, the executioner covered his \neyes. The condemned man uttered a few short, fervent prayers, then \nstretched his neck on the block. The executioner struck off his head \nwith one blow. Fishers body was dumped unceremoniously into a grave \nnear the Tower of London. His head was shown to Anne Boleyn at her \nrequest, before being parboiled and mounted on a spike on London \nBridge.\u0014\n\u0014\nCHRISTIAN HISTORY\u0014",

    "words": "Born an Obscure Slave, Frederick Douglass Was World-Famous at His \nDeath\u0014\n \u0014\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS* was born a slave around 1818 but died \ninternationally known and honored in 1895. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis path to success was not easy. Taken from his mother as a child, \nhe was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, who died when he \nwas seven. After that he had no one to shield him from the full \ninjustice of the slave system. Although one masters wife helped him \nlearn the alphabet, most slave owners treated him brutally. He longed \nfor someone to protect him. When he was thirteen, he found that \nprotector. A white Methodist preacher showed him that he could have a \nfather in God. Though for weeks I was a poor broken-hearted mourner \ntraveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden \nlightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders \nnot excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever.\u0014\n \u0014\nHe studied the Bible and taught forty fellow-slaves to read. Douglass \nlater said, He who does not improve himself by the motives and \nopportunities afforded by this world gives the best evidence that he \nwould not improve in any other world. \u0014\n\u0014\nHalf-starved by Thomas Auld, one of his masters who claimed to be a \nChristian, Douglass often contrived to loose one of his masters \nhorses, knowing it would run to a neighboring farm. He would follow \nand recapture it, sure of getting a good meal from the cook. When \nAuld could not break Douglass of this practice, he sent him work for \na tough planter known for breaking slaves.\u0014\n \u0014\nCovey, the planter, beat Douglass often until one day the desperate \nboy, then about sixteen years old, fought back and got the best of \nthe man. After that Covey did not try to whip him again. Three years \nlater, Douglass fell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman. \nShe encouraged his plan to run north toward freedom. In 1838 he \nescaped to Pennsylvania dressed as a sailor and carrying false \npapers. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe hurried to New York where Anna joined him and they married. The \nnewlyweds made their way to Massachusetts. There Douglass came into \ncontact with abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who encouraged \nDouglass to write and speak for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery \nSociety. As one of its spokesmen, Douglass visited Britain and \nIreland where he won many friends. Eventually he broke with Garrison, \nfinding him too radical, and published his own anti-slavery journals. \u0014\n\u0014\nDouglass was an important spokesman in the abolitionist cause and an \nordained minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. He \ndid not remain many years with this church, however, because he felt \nit was tainted by the dominant American acceptance of slavery. He \nrejected any Christianity that endorsed or tolerated the enslavement \nof one people by another.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have, in several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, \nrespecting religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my \nreligious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion....What I \nhave said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply \nto the slave holding religion of this land, and with no possible \nreference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of \nthis land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest \npossible differenceso wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, \nand holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and \nwicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy \nof the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity \nof Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slave holding, \nwomen-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical \nChristianity of this land.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Douglass met President Lincoln, with whom he \ndiscussed the recruitment and treatment of black soldiers. After the \nend of slavery, he held several government posts, including that of \nminister-resident and consul general to the Republic of Haiti. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 20 February 1895, Douglass collapsed suddenly and \nunexpectedly while speaking with his wife. Although a doctor reached \nhis side quickly, he was unable to revive Douglass. Douglass was \nabout seventy-eight years old, among the best-known and most loved \nAfrican-Americans of his generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "BISHOP POLYCARP FOLLOWED CHRIST INTO THE FIRE",
    "words": "Bishop Polycarp Followed Christ Into the Fire\u0014\n \u0014\nPOLYCARP holds a special place in church history. He was an \nintermediary between the age of the apostles and the church of the \nsecond century, as well as being one of the earliest martyrs about \nwhom we have an eyewitness account. His writings quote from most of \nthe books of the New Testament, confirming their authenticity. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn around AD 70, Polycarp evidently became a Christian before he \nwas thirty, for he learned the gospel at the feet of the apostle \nJohn, who is thought to have survived until the onset of the second \ncenturythe last of the original twelve apostles. Polycarp in turn \nmentored a young man named Irenaeus, who became famous for his \nwritings against heresy. Polycarps character reflected Johns. He \nhad the same gentle spirit, yet was inflexible in speaking out \nagainst error. Irenaeus later reported that Polycarp would literally \nrun from heretical speech. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen John died, the truths of Christianity lived on with his \ndisciples, of whom Polycarp, by then bishop of Smyrna, became the \nbest-known to posterity, not only because of his frequent appearance \nin the literature of the early church, but also because of his \ntriumphant death. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Johns Apocalypse, Christ had warned the church at Smyrna they \nwere about to face persecution and promised a crown of life to those \nwho were faithful unto death. Polycarp undoubtedly encouraged his \nflock with these words when the Romans hauled several of them off to \nface death by wild beasts or fire. Polycarp soon had to apply the \npromise to himself. Not satisfied with the blood of their first \nvictims, the Roman mob called for his death. \u0014\n\u0014\nFriends persuaded him to hide in a farm-house and later to flee to \nanother. While praying, Polycarp had a vision. He turned and said to \nthose with him, It must be that I shall be burned alive. By \ntorturing two slave boys, the authorities learned Polycarps \nwhereabouts. They sent men to arrest him. This time Polycarp refused \nto flee, saying, the will of God be done. He ordered food set \nbefore the soldiers and asked for an hour to pray. His prayer was so \nimpressive that the soldiers questioned their orders to arrest such a \ngood man. They allowed him two hours with God before leading him back \nto town. \u0014\n\u0014\nA magistrate ordered Polycarp to renounce Christ and give obedience \nto Caesar as Lord. Polycarp answered: Eighty and six years have I \nserved Christ, nor has He ever done me any harm. How, then, could I \nblaspheme my King who saved me? You threaten the fire that burns for \nan hour and then is quenched; but you know not of the fire of the \njudgment to come, and the fire of eternal punishment. Bring what you \nwill. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 23 February 155, Polycarp died at the stake. Miracles \naccompanied his death and the faithful collected his remains as \nrelics. The church of Smyrna recorded all this in a letter they sent \nto sister churches.\u0014\n \u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

Under their \nleadership, the remnant of exiles who had returned to Israel rebuilt \nGod's house, which was completed on this day, March 12, 515 BC But it \nwasn't much to look at.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it not in your sight as nothing?\" the Lord asked them. Well, they \nshould not think that way. God's Spirit was with them. And a day was \ncoming when the Lord would shake Heaven and earth, the sea and the \ndry land. \"I will fill this house with splendor,\" God promised. \"The \nlatter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former,\" said \nthe Lord. \"From this day on, I will bless you,\" he promised.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe temple, rebuilt in 516 BC, was rebuilt yet again by Herod the \nGreat, who restored it in stone and covered it with gold. It was that \ntemple that Christ visited in his life, bringing it glory. A \ngeneration after Christ's death and resurrection, Herod's temple was \ncast down by the Romans. A mosque now stands on its platform.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaggai also prophesied that all the nations would bring their \ntreasures to the temple. That event has not been fulfilled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBible. O.T. Haggai. Revised Standard Version.\u0014\nFinegan, Jack. Handbook of Biblical Chronology.

    "title": "BEST KNOWN PATRIOTIC SONGS",
    "words": "ON THIS DAY, 16 November 1895, Samuel Francis Smith was about to \nboard a train to Boston to fulfill a preaching assignment. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly he gasped, threw up his hands, and collapsed dead. \nObituaries appeared in newspapers all across the United States, for \nthe Baptist preacher was highly regarded as the author of one of \nAmericas best-known patriotic songs: America.. Its last stanza was \nperhaps its best: \u0014\n\u0014\nOur fathers God, to Thee,Author of liberty,\u0014\nTo Thee we sing.\u0014\nLong may our land be bright\u0014\nWith freedoms holy light;\u0014\nProtect us by thy might,\u0014\nGreat God our king.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts in 1808, he studied at a Latin school, \nthen at Harvard, and finally at Andover before becoming a Baptist \npastor. He especially loved the study of languages and learned \nfifteen over the course of his life. Between 1834 and 1841 he was \nsimultaneously pastor of the First Baptist Church in Waterville and \nprofessor of languages at its college. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was his knowledge of languages which led him to write his famous \nhymn. In 1831 hymn writer Lowell Mason was given copies of some \nGerman hymns and music and, unable to read the words, asked Smith to \nlook them over and translate any that had merit, or write new words \nfor the German tunes. \u0014\n\u0014\nLooking these over on a dismal day the following February, Smith \nsaw a tune that looked easy for children to sing. The German words \nwere patriotic. I was instantly inspired to write a patriotic hymn \nof my own, he said later. He had been writing verse since the age of \neight, and it took him only about half an hour to dash off the famous \nlines. Although he did not know it at the time, the tune was the same \nas that to which the British sing God Save the Queen. He would be \ncriticized for using it. But evidently Lowell Mason wasnt bothered. \nHe surprised Smith by playing America that fourth of July. \u0014\n\u0014\nSmith was editor of The Christian Review and of Baptist missionary \npublications, as well as books of hymns and psalms. He also edited a \nhistory of Newton, Massachusetts, where he was a pastor for many \nyears and where he still resided at the time of his death. He later \nwrote a life of Joseph Grafton, one of his predecessors in the Newton \nchurch. Twice he toured mission fields in behalf of his denomination. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn April of 1895, seventh months before his sudden death, a \ntestimonial committee honored him with a fundraiser for his hymn.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "BLACK METHODISTS ELECTED THEIR FIRST BISHOPS",
    "words": "Free at Last, Black Methodists Elected Their First Bishops\u0014\n\u0014\nMETHODISTS in the United States split over slavery in 1844 when a \nsouthern bishop acquired slaves. Anti-slavery Methodists proposed to \nban the man from exercising his office as a bishop until he rid \nhimself of his human property. While northern Methodists voted for \nthe resolution, southern Methodists voted against it. Consequently, \nnorth and south parted ways. \u0014\n\u0014\nA quarter of a million slaves worshipped with Southern Methodists at \nthis point. However, they were not content to remain in this \narrangement after the Civil War, and began going elsewhere. Rather \nthan lose all their African-American brothers and sisters, leaders of \nthe Methodist Episcopal Church South encouraged the emancipated \nslaves to form their own general conference. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn December 1870, African-American Methodists from eight states met \nin Jackson, Tennessee. Samuel Watson, one of the delegates and an \neyewitness to the entire convention said, I have never seen a more \nharmonious conference of any kind. There was a good degree of \nintelligence among its members. Under the leadership of Bishop \nDaniel Payne, they founded the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church,* \nforming a new branch of Methodists. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 21 December 1870, the fledgling organization chose its \nfirst two bishops. After praying for divine guidance, they elected \nWilliam Henry Miles and Richard H. Vanderhorst. This was no easy or \nin-name-only job. The two would have to travel a good deal and \nsubsist on meager pay. When the Committee on Church Organization \npresented its report, it said in part: We request the bishops to \norganize our General Conference on the basis of the Discipline of the \nMethodist Episcopal Church, South, in its entire doctrine, \ndiscipline, and economy, making only such verbal alterations and \nchanges as may be necessary to conform it to our name and the \npeculiarities of our condition. \u0014\n\u0014\nMiles proved to be a great organizer and guided the Colored \nMethodists for twenty-two years. Vanderhorst was a powerful preacher, \nwho brought people under deep conviction with his sermons. Everyone \nmourned when he died just eighteen months after his election.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n-\u0014\n*In 1954 the name was changed to Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.\u0014",

    "title": "BURDENS BUILD CHARACTER",
    "words": "John Ruskin, a man of immense intelligence and a noted author, wrote \nin his old age about what he missed in his youth. He was the son of \nrich parents who gave him everything except, according to Ruskin, two \nthings which every life needs. He puts it this way: (1) \"I had \nnothing to love. My parents were remote and as planetary as the sun \nand moon. There was nobody to help, nobody to thank. (2) I had \nnothing to endure. Danger of any kind I knew not. My strength was \nnever exercised, my patience never tried.\" Those are two great needs \nof life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn the other hand, let me tell you about Susanna and about how \nburdens build character. She was the twenty-fifth child in a \ndissenters family. A dissenter was an English Protestant who moved \naway in their thinking from the Church of England, we call the \nEpiscopal Church.\u0014\n             \u0014\n           Though brilliant herself, Susanna attained little \neducation. She married an older man and bore him nineteen children. \nNine of them died early. Her house burned up twice. Her barn fell \ndown. Her health failed, and she lived with the wolf at the door for \nthe rest of her life. Her name was Susanna Wesley.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Samuel and Susanna, married in 1689, and began pastoring \nin dreary little Epworth (England) in 1697. They served there forty \nyears, enduring hardships like these:\u0014\n         \u0014\n            Samuels salary was so small (and he was so incapable of \nmanaging it) that he was thrown into debtors prison twice, leaving \nSusanna to fend for herself.\u0014\n            They disagreed about Susannas ministry, for her Bible \nlessons drew more listeners than his sermons.\u0014\n            Susanna gave birth to a daughter in 1705. The nurse, \nexhausted by overnight carousing, slept so soundly the next morning \nthat she rolled on the baby and smothered it.\u0014\n          *Several of her children were so wayward that she called \nthem a constant affliction.\u0014\n            Her brother promised her a sizable gift, which she \nlooked forward to as the chance to start a new day of fiscal \nresponsibility. He disappeared mysteriously and was never heard from \nagain.\u0014\n            Finally, on July 21, 1731, Susanna described an accident \nin which her horses stampeded, throwing Samuel from their wagon and \ninjuring him so badly that he was never well from that day on.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            A difficult life, wouldnt you say? A lot of people would \nhave just given up. And yet the parsonage at Epworth was destined to \nbecome the most celebrated one in English history, for from it came \ntwo of the greatest evangelists of all time, John and Charles Wesley. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tJohn Wesley was the originator of the Methodist Church, and Charles \nWesley was an unmatched creator of beautiful hymns. The number of his \ncompositions greatly exceeds any other hymn-writer in the English \nlanguage. To believers of every stripe throughout the Christian \nworld, he is the Father of Sacred Song. Many of his hymns are in \nhymnbooks today. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis biographer, says: \"His name will live (forever) in the annals of \nthe Church. He has no equal in the English language. And the mother \nwho raised them in every way fit the description of weary and \nheavy-laden. But she impacted the world because of her faith..\u0014",

    "words": "5 Facts About the Infamous Crime Duo Bonnie and Clyde\u0014\nThey only knew each other four years and more than half ot that time \nhe was in jail\u0014\n\u0014\nBONNIE AND CLYDE\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie was born October 1, 1910 in Rowna, Texas. .In January 1930, \nClyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker met at a friends house in Dallas, \nTexas, and, as the legend goes, it was love at first sight. Their \nbudding courtship was disrupted when Clyde was jailed a month later \nin Waco, but at Clydes request, Bonnie smuggled a gun into the jail, \nallowing Clyde and two other convicts to escape. It was a temporary \nfreedom, however, as Clyde was soon captured in Ohio and extradited \nto Texas, serving almost two years in prison before being paroled in \nFebruary 1932. Bonnie and Clyde were reunited soon after, and Bonnie \nbecame part of the Barrow Gang, which included several of Clydes \nfriends, his brother Buck, and Bucks wife, Blanche.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe news stories of Bonnie and Clydes criminal adventures captivated \na downtrodden nation at the height of the Great Depression. Their \noutlaw antics and unlikely love story helped turn the gangster and \nhis moll into folk heroes akin to Robin Hood and Maid Marian or Romeo \nand Juliet. But it wasnt meant to last. After an increasingly \nviolent crime spree that stretched almost two years, the pair was \nambushed and killed by law enforcement in Louisiana in 1934. Their \ndeaths made headlines across the nation, and thousands of people \nattended their funerals.Over the years, the exploits of Bonnie and \nClyde became synonymous with a kind of romantic lawlessness usually \nreserved for tales of the Wild West. Here are five surprising facts \nabout one of the most infamous crime duos in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde Were Never Married\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde were partners in crime who became immortalized in \nmyth and legend  but they were never married, because Bonnie already \nhad a husband. In 1926, just a few days before she turned 16, Bonnie \nParker married her high school sweetheart, Roy Thornton. Their \nmarriage was tumultuous and Thornton was often absent or in trouble \nwith the law. The couple separated numerous times, and Bonnies \nmother Emma recommended divorce, but Bonnie refused. Though she was \nidentified as Mrs. Roy Thornton in wanted posters and was still \nwearing her wedding ring when she was killed, Bonnie personally \nreverted to her maiden name, and her tombstone reads Bonnie Parker. \nThornton, who was in prison for robbery when he learned of Bonnies \ndeath, said, Im glad they went out like they did. Its much better \nthan being caught. Thornton was shot and killed three years later \nduring an attempted prison break.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir Own Photos Contributed to Their Notoriety as Outlaws\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen law enforcement raided a Barrow Gang hideout in Joplin, \nMissouri, officers recovered a camera and undeveloped film. The \nprints were developed and a few of the shots of Bonnie and Clyde ran \nin newspapers and tabloids. In one, Bonnie pointed a rifle at Clyde; \nin another, she had a cigar in her mouth and was holding a revolver. \nThe images contributed to the couples notoriety, leading newspapers \nto describe Bonnie as a cigar-smoking gun-moll. But Bonnies cigar \nwas just a prop borrowed from another member of the gang. Tell them \nI dont smoke cigars, she later told a police officer theyd taken \nhostage and released, when he asked what she wanted the press to \nknow. As for the guns she posed with, theres no evidence that Bonnie \never killed, or even fired at, anyone. The FBI describes Bonnies \ncriminal association with Clyde this way: Though she probably never \nfired a shot, she was his willing accomplice.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThey Both Wrote Poetry About Their Life of Crime\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2019, a collection of written material connected to Bonnie and \nClyde was auctioned, including several poems attributed to the \ncouple. Before dropping out of school to marry Thornton, Bonnie \nshowed academic promise and enjoyed writing poetry. Even when she \njoined the Barrow Gang, she continued to pen poems. In a final visit \nwith her family less than two weeks before she and Clyde were killed \nin Louisiana, Bonnie gave a copy of her poem The Story of Bonnie and \nClyde to her mother. In the final lines of her poem, Bonnie \nacknowledged their inevitable end: Some day theyll go down together \n/ And theyll bury them side by side / To few itll be grief, to the \nlaw a relief / But its death for Bonnie and Clyde. In a poem \nattributed to Clyde, he wrote, Bonnies just written a poem / The \nStory of Bonnie and Clyde. / So I will try my hand at poetry / with \nher riding by my side. He ended the poem acknowledging that Bonnie \nwas the better writer but, like her, he seemed resigned to their \ndeadly fate.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir Death Car Is on Display Outside Las Vegas\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the reasons Bonnie and Clyde were able to elude police for so \nlong was that they were constantly on the run. With law enforcement \npursuing them across the Midwest and Southwest  in Arkansas, \nIllinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas  \nthe couple resorted to setting up camp in rural areas and sleeping in \ncars they had stolen. Once there was enough evidence to pursue \nfederal interstate auto theft charges, the FBI became involved in the \nchase, and it was only a matter of time before the infamous duo was \ncaught. Their almost two-year crime spree spanned several states, \nwith the gang responsible for the murder of several people that \nincluded law enforcement officials. Bonnie and Clyde were killed in a \npolice ambush in a stretch of highway in Louisiana on May 23, 1934. \nToday, the stolen car in which Bonnie and Clyde died is on display \noutside Las Vegas. Visitors to Primm Valley Casino Resorts can see \nthe bullet-riddled 1934 V8 Ford sedan as well as the shirt Clyde was \nwearing when he was killed. The casino is believed to have paid \n$250,000 for the car in 1988.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1967 Film Was a Hit, But Its More Myth Than Truth\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing Bonnie and Clydes highly publicized deaths on May 23, \n1934, their funerals were held on different days and they were buried \nin different cemeteries, despite Bonnies wishes. Their story was \ntold, and retold, by family members and strangers, but for the most \npart it was just another tragic tale relegated to the annals of true \ncrime history. The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, starring Faye Dunaway \nand Warren Beatty, changed that forever, resurrecting Bonnie and \nClydes legend for the counterculture generation of the 1960s. The \nfilm portrayed the couple as glamorous, reckless gangsters who would \nrather die than surrender. However, Bonnie and Clyde biographer Jeff \nGuinn said the silver screen portrayal was less than 5% historically \naccurate, glossing over the grim reality of two young lovers from \nimpoverished backgrounds who felt they had nothing left to lose. \nDespite the inaccuracies, Bonnie and Clyde became a seminal film of \nthe New Hollywood era, hailed by film critic Roger Ebert as a \nmilestone in the history of American movies.\u0014\n---------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nn June of 1933, Bonnie was severely injured in a car accident, with \nher leg badly burned by battery acid. She often had to be carried for \nthe remainder of her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite a massive deployment by law enforcement officials that by \nlate 1932 included the FBI, the infamous couple managed to elude \nauthorities and avoid capture for nearly two years, becoming two of \nAmerica's most well-known outlaws along the way. By early 1934, they \nwere being pursued by a posse that included Texas Ranger captain \nFrank Hamer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde were unwilling killers who released more people than \nthey hurt\u0014\nOn the run constantly, Bonnie and Clyde could never rest easy; there \nwas always a chance that someone would become aware of their \npresence, notify the police, and create the opportunity for \nbloodshed. This happened over and over through their short and \nviolent careerviolent because, once cornered, Clyde would kill \nanyone in order to avoid capture and a return to prison. Fourteen \nlawmen died along the way. If it were possible, however, Clyde would \nmore often abduct someone (sometimes a cop), make a getaway, and then \nrelease the person somewhere down the line. In more than one \ninstance, he gave the unharmed kidnapped victim money to get back \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublic opinion turned against Bonnie and Clyde after reports of the \nmurder of two motorcycle cops on Easter Sunday, 1934. Sleeping late \nin their car near Grapevine, Texas, Bonnie, Clyde and Henry Methvin \nwere taken by surprise by the policemen, who suspected a car of \ndrunks. Clydes injunction to Henry to kidnap the cops, Lets take \nthem, was misinterpreted as an encouragement to fire, and Henry blew \naway patrolman E.B. Wheeler. The situation beyond saving, Clyde fired \non the other cop, a rookie named H.D. Murphy, whose first day it was \non the job. Murphy was about to get married, and his fiance wore her \nwedding gown to the funeral. The public, who had often cheered the \nbrash and brazen outlaws, now wanted to see them caughtalive or dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeath\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the murder of a police officer in Commerce, Oklahoma, by gang \nmember Henry Methvin, Bonnie and Clyde were pursued for weeks. In the \nmorning of May 23, 1934, they drove into an ambush on Highway 154 in \nLouisiana, and were killed by police in a hail of bullets. The ambush \nwas in fact set up by the father of Methvin, who wanted leniency for \nhis son.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry Methvin seemed to share a similar devotion to his family. Clyde \nand Bonnie took this as evidence of Henry's trustworthiness and did \nall they could to make sure he saw his own family as often as \npossible. Henry, however, conspired with his father to betray Bonnie \nand Clyde by alerting the police to their whereabouts in return for \nhis own pardon. It was on a trip to pick up Henry from his fathers \nhouse that Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of their deaths, Bonnie and Clyde were so famous that \nsouvenir-seekers at the scene attempted to make off with locks of \ntheir hair, pieces of their clothing and even one of Clyde's ears. \nTheir bodies were eventually returned to Dallas, and despite their \nwishes to be buried side by side, they were interred in separate \ncemeteries. Thousands traveled to each of their funerals, with \nnewspapers publishing extra editions to mark the services.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde were difficult to embalm and they knew their embalmer\u0014\n\u0014\nBonnie and Clyde famously died in a hailstorm of bullets shot at \ntheir car by an assembled posse of Texas and Louisiana lawmen. \nStopping to help Henry Methvins father fix his apparently \nbroken-down truck on a Louisiana road, Clyde pulled the car to a stop \nwhen the posse opened fire without warning. Approximately 150 rounds \nlater, Bonnie and Clyde lay dead in their car, which was pockmarked \nwith several holes. Not taking any chances, the leader of the posse, \nFrank Hamer, even approached the car and fired several additional \nshots into the already dead Bonnies body. Her hand still held part \nof the half-eaten sandwich that would be her last meal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe coroners report detailed 17 holes in Clydes body and 26 holes \nin Bonnies body. Unofficially, there may have been many more. C.B. \nBailey, the undertaker assigned to preserve the bodies for the \nfunerals, found that the bodies had so many holes in them in so many \ndifferent places that it was difficult to keep embalming fluid in \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssisting Bailey was a man named Dillard Darby, who had been \nkidnapped by the Barrow gang a year earlier after his car had been \nstolen by them and hed tried to retrieve it. At the time, Bonnie was \nmorbidly tickled to discover that the man theyd kidnapped was an \nundertaker, and she asked Darby to take care of the gangs mortuary \nneeds in the future. Little did Clyde and Bonnie know when they gave \nDarby five dollars and released him that day that he would indeed \nattend to them after death.\u0014",

    "words": "BUZZ ALDRIN PARTOOK COMMUNION OUT OF THIS WORLD\u0014\n \u0014\nMANY CHRISTIANS have only taken Communion (also known as Eucharist, \nand the Lords Supper) in church. However, the rite has actually been \nobserved in many other settings. Believers have observed it secretly \nin anti-Christian prisons. Soldiers have taken it on the battlefield. \nChaplains offer it to residents in nursing homes and to the dying in \nhospitals and hospice houses. Some have observed it out of doors. But \nprobably the most unique setting ever for a service of Communion was \nout of this world.\u0014\n\u0014\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, who was also an elder of Webster Presbyterian \nchurch near Houston, had obtained permission from the Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly to serve Communion to himself during the first moon \nlanding. He took a small chalice, bread, and wine. He had arranged to \nsynchronize the observance as nearly as possible with his home church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the designated moment on this day, July 20, 1969, he said into the \nradio,\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking. I would, like \nto request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each \nperson listening in, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate \nfor a moment the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in \nhis own individual way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNASA had forbidden a more explicit statement because Madalyn Murray \nOHair had previously sued after Apollo 8 astronauts read a portion \nof the Genesis creation story. She argued they had violated \nseparation of church and state. Therefore it was during this radio \nsilence that Aldrin took Communion and read a Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the \none-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully \nup the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very \nfirst liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, \nwere communion elements.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scripture he read to accompany the ceremony was John 15:5 in \nTodays English Version, I am the vine, you are the branches. \nWhoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you \ncan do nothing without me. \u0014\n\u0014\nWebster Presbyterian church commemorates Aldrins observance annually \nas Lunar Communion Sunday and preserves the chalice as a memorial of \nthe event.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

Poole is a Baptist \nminister with Lifeshare Community Ministries out of Jackson, \nMississippi where he delights in ministering alongside the poor. \nChuck Poole, a provocative preacher and servant pastor, served \nBaptist churches for twenty-five years.

A Bible always tilts, \nslopes, and leans in the direction of care for the poor. Exodus 22:25 \nsays, If you lend money to the poor, you shall not charge them \ninterest.  Leviticus 19:9-10 says, When you reap the harvest of your \nland, you shall not reap to the edges of your field.  You shall leave \nthe edges for the poor.  Deuteronomy 15:7-11 says, Do not be \nhard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your needy neighbor.  The poor \nwill always be with you, therefore I command you, open your hand to \nthe poor.  Proverbs 17:5 says, Those who mock the poor insult the \nLord.  Isaiah 58:7 says, Share your bread with the hungry, bring the \nhomeless poor into your home.  When you see the naked, clothe them.  \nMatthew 25:34-36 says, Come, you that are blessed by my Father, \ninherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the \nworld; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you \ngave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I \nwas naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of \nme, I was in prison and you visited me.  Luke 3:10 says, Whoever has \ntwo coats must share with anyone who has none.  Luke 6:30 says, Give \nto anyone who begs from you.  Luke 14:13 says, When you give a \nluncheon or a dinner, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame and the \nblind.  James 2:15-16 says, If a brother or sister is naked and lacks \ndaily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace and yet you do \nnot supply their bodily needs, what good is that?  And finally, I \nJohn 3:17 says, How can Gods love abide in anyone who has this \nworlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses to \nhelp them?  Apparently, the Bible is worried about those who are in \nneed. The Bible tilts, slopes and leans in the direction of the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\n            For me, too many years of stumbling around on that slope \nled me to leave the pastorate for a full-time ministry with some of \nour nations poor families.\u0014",

    "words": "Baptists and Women Deacons\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver\u0014\n12-29-03 \u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptists and women have again been in the news recently. New \nSouthern Baptist literature, the Baptist Center for Ethics has \nreported, is critical of the practice of women deacons.\u0014\nRead that again, not the old tirades against women pastors, but the \nnext item in the evolving fundamentalist agenda of the Southern \nBaptist Convention: no women deacons.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving taught Baptist history for years, I could pull out the \nevidence for women deacons in our heritage. But our \nReformed/Calvinist colleagues would tell us that the evidence is \nmisleading. Women deacons are permissible, some of them contend, when \nthe church also uses the biblical office of elder. In this case, \nwomen dont have spiritual authority over men. Women deacons can \nserve tables and male elders can make the decisions, according to \ntheir mental gymnastics.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are told that the move toward women deacons is a result of the \nliberalizing of Baptist life among moderate Baptists in the South \nand American Baptists in general.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut some enlightened Baptist women were actually asking for biblical \nequality several decades earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1948-1950 Maud Turman, a member of Second-Ponce de Leon Baptist \nChurch in Atlanta, wrote a series of letters to the board of deacons \nat her church and recommended the names of several women for service \nas deacons. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe deacon chair admitted that the women would probably do a better \njob than most of the men in the church, but such a radical change \nhad to come at the request of the whole church.\u0014\nTurmans response revealed some of the absurdities of the current \ndebate over deacons.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Women deacons are not a part of our tradition. We would have to \nchange our bylaws. Baptists--who dont acknowledge the role of \nauthoritative tradition--have, of course, never been shy to say we \nhave never done that before. Turman reminded her deacons: By-Laws \nare not like the laws of the Medes and Persians, and can easily be \nchanged. What needed to be changed were rather the minds of the \nstubborn men of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Democratic Baptists? Turman thought it ironic that \nnon-congregational denominations allowed women to serve in leadership \npositions in the church but Southern Baptists, claiming to be the \nmost democratic and congregational (and thus most biblical), refused \ndeacon service to women.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Duplicate the New Testament church? When Maud Turman was told by \nher pastor that the New Testament didnt have women deacons, her bold \nresponse was, Does it not seem that we should have made some \nprogress in nearly 2,000 years? She exposed the impossibility of \nbeing an exact replica of a New Testament church (how often have you \nheard the Baptist mantra, We are the New Testament church because \nJesus was baptized by John the Baptist?) by noting that New Testament \nchurches did not have large church buildings, Sunday schools and \nmission organizations like the Womans Missionary Union. The early \nchurch, Turman finally reminded her pastor, didnt have fine salaries \nlike modern Baptist pastors. \u0014\n\u0014\n--Women deacons in the New Testament. According to Turman, the \ncriterion for the use of women deacons was not whether the churches \nin the New Testament had them, but whether the practice is in the \nspirit of the Bible. The Baptist laywoman then told her deacons that \nthe New Testament did indeed have women deacons such as Phoebe (Rom \n16:1). \u0014\n\u0014\n--A dichotomy of sacred and secular authority? Turman knew that \nBaptist congregations were constantly exhorted to be Christian, not \njust on Sunday but every day of the week. There should be no \ndichotomy of the sacred and secular for Christians. So why are \nChristian men beginning to recognize that women are equal in all \nwalks of life except in the life of the church? \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen in the church have served faithfully for more years than most \nof our young deacons have lived, Turman gently chided her male \ndeacons. If the call of a deacon is based on a life of service, \nTurman knew which gender had provided most of the service in Baptist \nchurches. To quarantine spiritual authority for men violated \nGalatians 3:28 that indicated the spiritual equality of all believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaud Turman lost her argument to her churchs male deacons, but her \ncommon-sense argument is sound. What doesnt make any sense is why \nthose Southern Baptist leaders who argue against women deacons just \ndont jump ahead and add some more links to their chained fence and \ntell the women to keep silent in the church once and for all. At \nleast then they might claim to be consistent in their duplication of \nthe Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver is assistant professor of religion at Baylor University.\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTISTS AND GENESIS",
    "words": "Historical Review: Baptists and Genesis\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn M. Finley\u0014\n12-11-01 \u0014\n\u0014\nNineteenth century Southern Baptists debated many issues--missions, \nthe church, slavery, even Baptist history--yet simple biblical faith \nhelped them avoid heated confrontations over the Bible which would \ncome in the 20th century. When the agenda changed, however, the Book \nof Genesis was often at the center of the controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Darwin's theories on natural selection alongside modern \nbiblical scholarship produced the \"Evolution Controversy\" of the \n1920s. Personified by the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tenn., \nthe controversy was largely over whether or not creation passages in \nGenesis could be interpreted symbolically rather than literally.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists north and south, as well as Canadian Baptists, debated these \nissues with varying degrees of division. Fundamentalists like J. \nFrank Norris and C. P. Stealey allowed no room for evolutionists. \nModerate leaders like E. Y. Mullins of Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary tried to recast the debate in terms of \"supernaturalism\" \nversus \"naturalism\" rather than a vote up or down on evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt its annual meeting in 1923, the SBC adopted Mullins' views seeking \na more balanced relationship between science and religion. The \noriginal Baptist Faith and Message statement was adopted two years \nlater to bring theological consensus in denominational life. This was \nnot enough for hardline fundamentalists, who put the SBC on record in \n1926 with a strong statement against evolution and passed a \nresolution requiring convention employees to agree to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese actions preceded the fierce debate over Genesis yet to come in \nthe Elliott and Broadman controversies.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1961, Broadman Press published The Message of Genesis by Ralph \nElliott, a professor at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. \nUsing historical-critical methods, Elliott wrote a \"theological \ninterpretation\" of Genesis which suggested that the symbolic \n\"message\" of the creation stories mattered most. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen K. Owen White, pastor of First Baptist Church Houston, Texas, \ncriticized Elliott's views in Baptist state papers, an intense debate \nensued.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"Elliott Controversy\" consumed the 1962 SBC meeting. The \nconvention refused to ban Elliott's book, but it distanced itself \nfrom his methods and conclusions. Midwestern trustees asked Elliot to \npromise not to republish the book, but he refused and was promptly \ndismissed for \"insubordination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilar disagreement surfaced in 1970 in response to the first volume \nin the new Broadman Bible Commentary series. G. Henton Davies, an \nEnglish Baptist, had been chosen to write the exposition on Genesis, \nand his views quickly fell under criticism. Of special concern to \nmany conservatives was Davies' interpretation of Genesis 22:1-19, the \nstory of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac. \u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, fierce debate soon followed in Baptist state newspapers. At \nthe 1970 SBC meeting, messengers asked the Baptist Sunday School \nBoard to withdraw the volume and rewrite it \"with due consideration \nof the conservative viewpoint.\" Clyde Francisco, professor at \nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary, later wrote a revised \ncommentary on Genesis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the \"Broadman Controversy,\" Southern Baptists have engaged in \nsome of their most spirited denominational debate. Not surprisingly, \nGenesis has often been the catalyst. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1980s, seminary professors were often quizzed on whether \nthey believed in seven literal days of creation and whether Adam and \nEve were real, historical persons. The 1984 SBC resolution on women \ndrew upon the narrow argument that Eve was \"first in the Edenic \nfall.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis continues to ignite debates over creationism, the \nenvironment, and the roles of men and women.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn M. Finley is senior minister of First Baptist Church in \nSavannah, Ga.\u0014",

    "words": "We \nNeed to Read Roger Williams\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver\u0014\n12-02-02 \u0014\n\u0014\nI first read some writings from the pen of Roger Williams when I was \na first-year seminary student. For some unknown reason, I chose to do \na critical book review on a collection of Williams writings, edited \nwith commentary by Perry Miller. I was most thankful to Miller for my \ngrade.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reading didnt stop me from pursuing a career as a historian, but \nI did wonder if all church history was going to be so messy and \ndifficult. \u0014\n\u0014\nI recently read Williams classic, The Bloody Tenent for Cause of \nConscience, as an assignment for a conference hosted by the Center \nfor Baptist Studies at Mercer University. I took solace in the words \nof the expert, Edwin Gaustad, that the writing of Roger Williams is \nmessy and difficult. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the messiness, we need to read Roger Williams. In Williams, I \nread the convoluted but brilliant arguments of an Old \nTestament-styled prophet who took on all the forms of religious \nhypocrisy he could find in colonial Puritanism. \u0014\n\u0014\nUndoubtedly, I read a Biblicist: one immersed in a typological \nreading of the Bible that is foreign to our modern ears. Yet, I read \na prophet who relentlessly hammered out the folly of the union of \nchurch and state and the necessity of voluntarism and individual \njudgment for authentically free faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nI read a pious restorationist who dreamed of an elusive apostolic \nfaith, yet I read the dissent of a gadfly who appeared to accept \nnothing of a fundamentalist-styled conformity in the Puritan \nestablishment. I read a lover of religious freedom, who would never \nforce his views upon anyone because of the corrosive and deceptive \neffects of the self-righteousness of spiritual finality. Yet, I read \na passionate believer whose liberty also meant he could and would \ntell others he thought they were very wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Williams, I read not one motivated by religious indifference, but \na zealous Christian who wanted liberty of conscience to preserve \npurity in the garden of the church from the wilderness of the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me elaborate on a few of these images. Like the Old Testament \nprophet who lashed out against the wealthy in their oppression of the \npoor, Williams saw more humanity in Native Americans who would never \nforce worship upon anyone or commit spiritual rape. \u0014\n\u0014\nI hope we have no difficulty recognizing Williams convictions about \nthe hypocrisy of a national church, the misuse of carnal weapons \nagainst the conscience, and the incompetent and inappropriate use of \nthe spiritual sword by civil magistrates.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is rare to find a king, prince or governor like Christ Jesus, \nwrote Williams, who also noted that Jesus and Paul never relied on \nthe power of the magistrate to support them.\u0014\n \u0014\nSo many people today identify religious liberty with absolute \ntolerance and a lack of conviction. The Bloody Tenent reminds us that \nfreedom means the willingness to live side by side with people you \ndont like or trust. In vitriolic language, Williams called Catholics \nwhores, and the English Anglican and Puritan establishments were \ntheir daughters. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe ridiculed Anabaptists for their denial of the possibility of a \nmagistrate being a Christian. He lambasted the free will of \nArminianism as popish doctrine. Perhaps we should enjoy the liberty \nWilliams grants us to question his Calvinism. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams was no modern ecumenist. He might excommunicate many of us. \nJohn Cotton, his Puritan opponent, thought he could justify \npersecution because people sinned against their conscience. Williams \njudged that Cotton was deluded by his self-righteousness. The state \nhas no business deciding who is elect or not. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophetic dissenter knew that what was fundamental to one group \nwas not always fundamental to others. In the end, however, Williams \nsaid we could live side by side because, despite all our convictions, \nhe humbly admitted we might be wrong this side of heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe unrelenting force of Williams argument that the tenent of a \nnational church dripped in blood has been seen over and over again in \nhistory. Williams told us forcefully that the Prince of Peace should \nnot be associated with our lust for forced conformity and reliance \nupon the civil government. The church has been given sufficient means \nto discipline itself, and to persuade others of the truth of the \ngospel. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood words to heed from the old curmudgeon we claim as the founder of \nthe first Baptist church in America. Williams himself abandoned \nPuritanism and the Baptist church he had helped found (the first in \nAmerica), opposing all sects and creeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver is professor of Christianity and chair of the religion \nand philosophy division at Brewton-Parker College in Mt. Vernon, Ga.\u0014",

    "words": "Because He Lives: Baptists and Elvis\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver\u0014\n08-14-02 \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Elvis Presley was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Gospel \nMusic Association on Nov. 27, 2001, not all Baptists (or other \nChristians) were pleased. Elvis Presley stood for everything rock \nn roll stands for: sexual license; rebellion against authority; \nself-fulfillment; if it feels good do it and dont worry about \ntomorrow; and moral debauchery glossed over with a thin veneer of \nshallow, humanistic spirituality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist Baptist Information Service concluded for \nSouthern gospel and contemporary Christian music people to honor \nElvis Presley in such a manner is evidence of the great worldliness \nthat permeates commercial Christian music today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndependent Baptists have not been alone in criticizing Elvis \nPresley, the undisputed King of Rock n Roll. Presley was \nconstantly hounded and dogged by attacks from Christians who \nattempted to resist the cultural shockwaves that appeared to \naccompany rock n roll in the 1950s. \u0014\n\u0014\nInitially, there was much about the young pioneering rock singer to \nconcern Baptists. Born in Tupelo, Miss., in 1935, Presley was raised \nin the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal group then on the margins of \nAmerican religion, and a group Baptists often called holy rollers. \nPresley testified to a religious conversionan experience that could \ntranscend denominational boundariesbut he also could claim the \nbaptism of the Spirit (at age nine), a second experience Baptists \nconsidered bogus. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the expressive Pentecostal setting, however, Presley was exposed \nto the influences of (Southern) gospel music. In his later years, he \nrecalled that he knew gospel music since he was two years old: that \nwas music to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Presley family moved to Memphis in 1948. As a teen-ager Elvis \nbegan attending all-night gospel sings. He was also influenced by \ncountry music and black rhythm and blues. His family scolded him for \nlistening to the bluesit was sinful musicbut Presleys own music \nbore the imprint of gospel, country and especially R & B.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresleys career began in 1954, and two years later he was an \ninternational sensation. An official Elvis Presley Web site asserts \nthat Presley ushered in a whole new era of American music and \npopular culture. Or in the words of Alice Cooper, there will never \nbe anybody cooler than Elvis Presley.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern historian Charles R. Wilson says that the 1950s was the \ndecade of anti-heroes: Marlon Brando in a leather jacket, James Dean \nas a misunderstood teenage rebel, and Elvis as a punk singer. His \nlook is insolent, sullen, and sneering. ... the mysterious, somewhat \nmenacing young man awakening sexuality in young girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists in the 1950s definitely agreed. In 1957, a Baptist minister \nfrom Jacksonville, Fla., made national headlines with his accusation \nthat Presley gave a dirty show. Elvis responded, I dont do no \ndirty body movements, but Life gave two pages to the ministers \ncontinuing tirade against Presley for reaching a new low in \nspiritual degeneracy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf many Christians thought the young rebellious Presley of the 1950s \nrevealed the lascivious agenda of rock n roll, there were at least \nmixed emotions when the 1960s image began to highlight the \nall-American boy who could sing cherished Southern gospel songs. Of \nElvis 14 Grammy nominations, his three awards were for gospel \nrecordings. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical Christians have publicly wondered about Elvis final \ndestiny. At the 15th anniversary of his death in 1992, an article in \nChristianity Today queried, Is the King in the Kingdom? Presleys \nlifestyle at the end of his career left many to wonder if the young \nrebel was eternally rebellious.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the last decade, Elvis half-brother, Southern Baptist \nevangelist Rick Stanley, has attempted to rehabilitate Presleys \nChristian identity. While lamenting that Elvis was lured into \nEastern philosophy in 1964, Stanley exhorted that Elvis actually \nhad a role in his own conversion. The King also read the Bible \nregularly and sang gospel music as his form of preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some Baptists still loathe Elvis and rock n roll, some \nBaptist churches now have Elvis impersonators do entertainment for \nchurch fellowships. Elvis, in the words of Charles R. Wilson, has \nbecome an American icon. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne thing is still uncertain, however. According to a 1996 poll, 10 \npercent of Americans believed Elvis still lives. No figures were \navailable for how many Baptists said yes. \u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver is professor of Christianity and chair of the religion \nand philosophy division at Brewton-Parker College in Mt.

    "title": "BREAKING THE SPEECH LIMITS",
    "words": "Breaking the Speech Limits\u0014\n\u0014\nHow activists are trying to deny democracy, and why a bill designed \nto extend free speech won't pass.\u0014\nCompiled by Ted Olsen | posted 06/10/2004\u0014\n\u0014\nThe exemption loss lie\u0014\n\u0014\nAt several Oregon churches the last few Sundays, worshipers have been \nasked to sign a petition for a state constitutional ban on same-sex \nmarriages.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The campaign  has raised questions about how far churches can go to \npromote ballot measures without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, \nwhich carries some limits on political activity,\" writes James Mayer \nof The Oregonian. Later in the story Mayer goes into more detail:\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 1,000 churches are involved in the petition drive, said Ray \nCotton, pastor of New Hope Community Church in Clackamas and an \norganizer of the Defense of Marriage Coalition.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton said tables are set up in the church foyer and people are \nencouraged to sign the petitions after the service. About 1,000 \npeople signed May 30, he said, the first serious effort to get \nsignatures.  \u0014\n\u0014\n[Basic Rights Oregon communications director Rebekah] Kassell said \nher group is monitoring the political activity of the churches \nworking to get the initiative on the ballot.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Talking about the issue is one thing,\" she said. \"Actively \ncollecting signatures, launching a political organization and \ngathering funds to defeat or support a ballot measure, that's \nsomething else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe risk for churches is the loss of their federal tax-exempt status \nas nonprofits.  Federal laws prohibit tax-exempt churches from \nsupporting or opposing candidates for office.  The laws do allow \nsome lobbying on legislative matters, which include ballot measure \nsignature drives. Lobbying cannot exceed an \"insubstantial\" share of \nthe church's overall activities. The law doesn't define the term. One \ncourt said churches can devote less than 5 percent of their \nactivities to lobbying without jeopardizing their status, though \nanother court said more than 20 percent would endanger it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThanks to Mayer for including those numbers, which are far too often \nleft out of media reports that generalize about tax regulations on \nchurches' political involvement. But tax law is a complicated thing, \nand the numbers aren't as cut and dried as they may first appear. For \nstarters, a church doesn't only exist on Sunday mornings. Let's say \nthe average congregation has three full-time staff (it may be more, \nbut there are an awful lot of small churches out there). Does Oregon \nhave many small congregations where the staff are spending six hours \na week pushing for this amendment (and other legislation) as part of \ntheir jobs?\u0014\n\u0014\nAh, someone might say, but it's not only paid staffers; volunteers \ncount, too. That's true, but do you think that after you count all of \nthe hours that church volunteers spend each weekteaching Sunday \nschool, leading Awana, practicing for the worship team, running the \nsoup kitchenyou'll find that parishioners spent 20 hours out of \nevery 100 for an entire year campaigning for this amendment and other \nlegislation?\u0014\n\u0014\nSetting up tables in the church foyer to attract referendum \nsignatures clearly passes the 5 percent test, even if the effort is \nannounced during services. (By the way, if someone can demonstrate \nthat the gay marriage issue directly affects the operation of the \nchurchnot a big stretch, since most people marry in churchesthen \nthe church wouldn't even be held to the \"insubstantial\" rule.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSuggesting that churches are jeopardizing their tax-exempt status by \nallowing such an activity is an antidemocratic scare tactic. A \ncanard. A lie. (For more, here's the American Center for Law and \nJustice's helpful backgrounder and the IRS's own \"Tax Guide for \nChurches and Religious Organizations.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nLoosening the regulations on pulpits and politicsor tightening them?\u0014\nWhat the tax code clearly demands is that churches not \"participate \nin, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of \nstatements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition \nto) any candidate for public office.\" A measure recently introduced \nin the U.S. House of Representatives would amend the code to make \nsure that pastors could make political statements as private \ncitizens, and would allow up to three \"unintentional violations\" of \nthe candidate endorsement rule a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nHouse Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) got the House Ways and Means \nCommittee to add the text to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, \nexplaining to The Washington Post that it aims to \"meet the concerns\" \nof Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr. (R-N.C.), author of last year's failed \nHouses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act.\u0014\n\u0014\nJones also introduced that bill this year, but it won't get out of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee. Jones's bill goes much further \nthan the Hastert text, called the Safe Harbor for Churches provision \nsince there's no \"three strikes\" rule. (Weblog can't link to the Safe \nHarbor text directly, so click here and scroll down to \"Sec. 692.\"). \nJones's bills simply allow all political speech in the \"content, \npreparation, or presentation of any homily, sermon, teaching, \ndialectic, or other presentation made during religious services or \ngatherings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Jones's bill received wide support among politically \nconservative religious organizations, there's hardly a peep from such \ngroups this time around. And bad news for Hastert: The one peep so \nfar is negative. A letter from Richard Land, head of the Southern \nBaptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, is \nquoted in today's Washington Post as opposing the Safe Harbor \nprovision. The bill's language, Land is quoted as writing to House \nRepublican leaders, is \"loose enough that it could be interpreted to \nbroaden the restrictions\" on pulpit politicking instead of loosening \nsuch restrictions. \"This is a case in which the cure is worse than \nthe disease,\" Land said.\u0014\n\u0014\nExactly what Land opposes about the bill is not reported by the Post, \nbut a spokesman for Jones's office explains that the congressman's \nopposition to the provision is based on the penalty section. The \nbill, the spokesman explained to the Post, \"could increase Internal \nRevenue Service scrutiny of churches by creating a graduated set of \npenalties for violating the rules on political activity. At present, \nhe said, the IRS must make an 'all or nothing' decision: Either strip \na church's tax exemption or leave it alone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAn article in today's Washington Times suggests that the ACLJ \nsupports the Safe Harbor text, but isn't clear (the article is \nalready outdated, since it doesn't include Jones's opposition).\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's the political reality: When there's not broad support from the \nconstituency a provision is supposed to mobilize, when there's active \nopposition from the other side of the aisle, and when it's criticized \nby the congressman it's supposed to \"meet the concerns\" of, that \nprovision is as good as dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "June 18, 2004 NY TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nSTRATEGY \u0014\n\u0014\nBush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes\u0014\nBy DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK\u0014\n\u0014\nINDIANAPOLIS, June 17 - President Bush's re-election campaign took \nits effort to enlist churches in turning out conservative voters to \nthe annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention this week, \nurging pastors to do everything short of risking their churches' \ntax-exempt status to support the president's re-election.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bush's courtship of Southern Baptists, the largest Protestant \ndenomination, began Tuesday when he addressed them in a live telecast \nfrom the White House and thanked them for their prayers. The \ncampaign's appeals picked up in earnest the next day, when Ralph \nReed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, who is now an \nofficial of the Bush campaign, arrived to ask pastors more explicitly \nfor their help in winning votes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reed delivered his remarks at a Bush-Cheney \"pastors reception,\" \npaid for by the Bush campaign. The hosts were the departing president \nof the Southern Baptists and three other prominent leaders, and the \nreception was in a conference room of a hotel adjacent to the \nconvention. As the pastors came in, a campaign aide collected about \n100 signatures and addresses from ministers pledging to endorse Mr. \nBush's re-election publicly, to \"host a citizenship Sunday for voter \nregistration,\" to \"identify someone who will help in voter \nregistration and outreach\" and to organize a \" 'party for the \npresident' with other pastors\" on specific dates closer to the \nelection.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the pastors mingled around fountains of soft drinks and trays of \ncubed cheese, Mr. Reed urged, \"Without advocating on behalf of any \ncandidate or political party, you can make sure that everyone in your \ncircle of influence is registered to vote.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bush's political advisers often repeat their belief, Mr. Reed \nreminded the pastors, that about four million conservative Christian \nvoters did not vote in the last presidential election. The campaign \nis determined not to let that happen again.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the leaders of the 16 million Southern Baptists have already \norganized what they say is the first major voter registration drive \nin their history, beginning at the annual meeting. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut as the Bush campaign escalates its appeals to conservative \nChristian churches, experts in election law say, it is inviting \npastors toward potentially treacherous terrain where letting personal \nendorsements spill over into the business of their churches can \njeopardize their tax-exempt status.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"It is pushing the line,\" said Larry Noble, executive director of the \nCenter for Responsive Politics and the former general counsel to the \nFederal Election Commission. \"It goes to the question of, 'How often \ncan you switch hats?' \" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe dividing line in the tax laws gets even blurrier, Mr. Noble said, \nwhen the same pastors are also engaging in their clerical capacity in \nchurchwide voter-registration drives that are officially nonpartisan. \nAnd the line can become blurrier still, he added, if the church \nofficials are specifically directing their messages to partisan \nvoters - if, for example, Southern Baptist leaders believe that most \nof their members are likely to vote Republican.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then, when you start combining endorsements with church activity \nthat is supposed to be nonpartisan,\" Mr. Noble said, \"it gets \nmurkier.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSome Baptists have objected on religious grounds to the support of \nthe denomination's leaders for conservative politicians. Daniel \nVestal, a pastor and former candidate for president of the Southern \nBaptists who is now coordinator of the dissident Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship, which represents 450,000 parishioners, said the \ndenomination had traditionally accommodated a host of political views \namong its pastors and officials, until fundamentalists within the \ndenomination began taking over its leadership 25 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Southern Baptist Convention has become aligned with the secular \npolitical agenda of one particular part of one party, and that is \ntragic,\" Mr. Vestal said. But Dr. Jack Graham, the departing \npresident of the denomination, whom Mr. Reed contacted to be the host \nof the Bush-Cheney reception, said there was a clear distinction \nbetween his roles at the convention and at the reception. \"This is \nJack Graham the person, not Jack Graham the president of the Southern \nBaptists,\" he said in an interview at the event.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is more, he said, he believed the Bible called on Christians to \nsupport godly politicians.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about the potential benefits to the Bush campaign from his \npersonal endorsement as an individual and from the Southern Baptists' \nvoter registration efforts, Mr. Graham said: \"You can connect the \ndots. I don't mind if you connect the dots. You can't separate what \nyou believe from the political process. \"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reed, for his part, appeared to relish any criticism of the \ncampaign for cultivating churches, since it served to reinforce the \ncampaign's connection to the faith. In his speech at the reception, \nhe brought up recent criticism of the campaign over an e-mail message \nfrom Pennsylvania suggesting that supporters distribute campaign \ninformation inside the places of worship of \"friendly congregations,\" \nsomething specialists in election law say might jeopardize their tax \nstatus.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I, for one, believe people of faith have the same rights to \nparticipate in the political process as any other citizens,\" he said. \n\"Christians should not be treated as second-class citizens.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, in an interview, Mr. Reed acknowledged that the reference in \nthe Pennsylvania e-mail message to distributing campaign information \n\"in a place accessible to the congregation\" - presumably in the place \nof worship - might have gone too far. \"That I would not recommend,\" \nhe said.\u0014\nDr. Richard Land, the president of the Ethics and Liberty Commission \nof the Southern Baptist Convention and the denomination's principal \nadvocate in Washington, did not attend the Bush-Cheney event. He \nspent much of the convention presiding over the official kickoff of \nthe denomination's \"I Vote Values\" voter registration campaign.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to a Web site, it centers on a bus: on the outside of the \nbus is a picture of Dr. Land speaking about the importance of voting, \nand on the inside are interactive video monitors. The Baptists plan \nto send it around the country distributing booklets instructing \npastors and parishioners on how to comply with tax laws while \nregistering people to vote. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview, Dr. Land said the registration efforts would \nundoubtedly sign up some Democrats, since 20 percent of Southern \nBaptists voted Democratic in the last election and the \"I Vote \nValues\" campaign is carefully nonpartisan.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd several people at the convention did express some reservations \nabout the president. Al Oxford, a retired coal miner and Democrat \nfrom southern Illinois, criticized the Bush tax cuts. \"My daughter is \na single mother,\" she said. \"She didn't get any of that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "words": "BAPTISTS VALUE FREEDOM ABOVE \nORDER\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n06-30-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders through the ages often suppressed freedom to protect \norder, but Baptist forebears that developed apart from \nstate-sponsored religions affirmed freedom as a central principle and \npractice, says a South Carolina pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, when Baptists talk about freedom, it is not merely a political \nand cultural ideal that we affirm, Jeffrey Rogers, pastor of First \nBaptist Church in Greenville, S.C., says in a sermon published in \nEthicsDaily.coms Sermon Library. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor Baptists, freedom is not simply a lesson in American civics, \nRogers says in the July 4 sermon titled On Christian Freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nRather, freedom is a core value of our theology and our identity. \nFreedom is one of the defining elements of Baptists place in the \nlong and storied history of Christian faith and theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nRogers says people have often wondered why Baptist life has so often \nbordered on chaos and anarchy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is precisely because among Baptists freedom is a higher value \nthan order, he says. We would rather risk losing it all with \nfreedom than save it by coercion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no higher ideal among Baptists than a free pulpit and a \nfree pew in a free church in a free state, Rogers says. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sermon from Galatians 5, Rogers identifies three distinct \nfeatures of authentically Christian freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, Paul asserts that our freedom is grounded in the life and \nwork and person of Jesus ChristChrist has set us free, he says, in \nGalatians 5:1. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, Christian freedom is not an opportunity for \nself-indulgence. When freedom is abused as a pretense for \nself-indulgence, he says, It leads to slavery, not to liberty at \nall. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Rogers says, freedom makes love possible. Where there is no \nfreedom, there can be no love. Where there is no freedom there is \nonly destiny or necessity or fate. And if all is destiny or necessity \nor fate, then there can be no such thing as love, which is the free \noffering of oneself to another. \u0014\n \u0014\nFreedom makes love possible, he says.\u0014",

Campaign officials said the suggested \nactivities are intended to help churchgoers rally supporters without \nviolating tax rules that prohibit churches from engaging in partisan \nactivity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We strongly believe that our religious outreach program is well \nwithin the framework of the law,\" said Terry Holt, spokesman for the \nBush-Cheney campaign.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut tax experts said the campaign is walking a fine line between \npermissible activity by individual congregants and impermissible \nactivity by congregations. Supporters of Sen. John Kerry, the \npresumptive Democratic presidential nominee, charged that the \nBush-Cheney campaign is luring churches into risking their tax status.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think it is sinful of them to encourage pastors and churches to \nengage in partisan political activity and run the risk of losing \ntheir tax-exempt status,\" said Steve Rosenthal of America Corning \nTogether, a group working to defeat Bush.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe instruction sheet from the Bush-Cheney campaign to religious \nvolunteers lists 22 \"duties\" to be performed by specific dates. By \nJuly 31, for example, volunteers are to \"send your Church Directory \nto your State Bush-Cheney '04 Headquarters\" and \"Talk to your Pastor \nabout holding a Citizenship Sunday and Voter Registration Drive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Sept. 17, they are to host at least two campaign-related potluck \ndinners, and in October they are to \"finish calling all Pro-Bush \nmembers of your church,\" \"finish distributing Voter Guides in your \nchurch\" and place notices on\u0014\nchurch bulletin boards or in Sunday programs \"about all Christian \ncitizens needing to vote.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe document was provided to The Washington Post by a Democrat. A \nspokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, Frank Keith, said, \"It \nwould be inappropriate for the IRS, based on a limited set of facts \nand circumstances, to render a judgment about whether the activities \nin this document would or would not endanger a church's tax- exempt \nstatus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe pointed out, however, that the IRS on June 10 sent a strongly \nworded letter to both the Republican and Democratic national \ncommittees, reminding them that tax-exempt charitable groups \"are \nprohibited from directly or indirectly participating or intervening \nin any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any \ncandidate for public office.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe IRS letter noted that reli gious organizations can sponsor \ndebates, distribute voter guides and conduct voter registration \ndrives. But if those efforts show \"a preference for or against a \ncertain candidate or party ... it becomes a prohibited activity.\"\u0014",

Sellers | posted  07/05/04 12:01 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Iranian christian fled his country last September after \nauthorities in Tehran lashed him for leaving Islam and evangelizing \nMuslims. Identified only as Hooman, upon his release he escaped to \nTurkey with his Muslim wife.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He had been whipped, and the authorities were going to deal with him \nin an even more severe manner,\" says Abe Ghaffari, executive director \nof Iranian Christians International (ICI). \"He was persecuted by \nvigilantes as well. A motorcycle rider stabbed him and tried to kill \nhim.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nApparently the vigilante was a member of the terrorist group \nHezbollah, Ghaffari says, \"but in Iran they are like local enforcers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSince coming into office in 1997, the presumably reform-minded \nPresident Mohammad Khatami has shown no ability to rein in \nconservative clergy's persecution of religious minorities. Islamic \nleaders in government take their cues from the conservative Ayatollah \nAli Hoseini-Khamenei, Iran's \"supreme leader.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious conservatives on Iran's Expediency Council, which \ncoordinates institutions of the Shi'a Islam state, have vetoed \nreformist legislation. Furthermore, Ghaffari says, in February's \nparliamentary elections, Islamic clergy in the government \ndisqualified 2,000 mainly reformist candidates. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"So, although Iranian Christians have been continually persecuted,\" \nGhaffari says, \"we expect that it will get worse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a country of 67.7 million people, 99 percent are Muslim, though \nreportedly they are growing more resentful of conservative clerics. \nThere are some 220,000 Christians (more than half Orthodox, and \nperhaps as many as 15,000 Protestant), according to Operation World. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) notes \nthat discrimination against non-Muslims prevails in education, \ngovernment, and other areas. It reports that at least eight \nevangelicals have been killed by Iranian authorities in the past 13 \nyears, and 15 to 23 are missing or \"disappeared.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTo avoid such dangers, a young mother named Shahin fled to Turkey \nlast December. Authorities had threatened to imprison her for 25 \nyears for placing her faith in Christ\"apostasy,\" under Iranian law. \u0014\n\u0014\nICI's Ghaffari says Shahin left her Muslim husband in Iran. \"He also \nhas persecuted her,\" he says, \"and reported her to the Islamic \nauthorities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "BUSH SEEKS THE CHURCH'S SUPPORT -- OPENLY",
    "words": "Campaign organizers for President Bush have sent a document to \nchurches, asking for supporters to complete specific \"duties\" on \nbehalf of the campaign. It isn't the campaign's first appeal to \nchurchgoers, but this time, even evangelicals are questioning the \ntactics.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to The Washington Post, supporters' duties include:\u0014\n\u0014\nBy July 31, for example, volunteers are to \"send your Church \nDirectory to your State Bush-Cheney '04 Headquarters or give [it] to \na BC04 Field Rep\" and \"Talk to your Pastor about holding a \nCitizenship Sunday and Voter Registration Drive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Aug. 15, they are to \"talk to your Church's seniors or 20-30 \nsomething group about Bush/Cheney '04\" and \"recruit 5 more people in \nyour church to volunteer for the Bush Cheney campaign.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Sept. 17, they are to host at least two campaign-related potluck \ndinners with church members, and in October they are to \"finish \ncalling all Pro-Bush members of your church,\" \"finish distributing \nVoter Guides in your church\" and place notices on church bulletin \nboards or in Sunday programs \"about all Christian citizens needing to \nvote.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe potential alliance is drawing the ire of groups advocating the \nseparation of church and state. According to Reuters, Americans \nUnited for Separation of Church and State said, \"Any coordination \nbetween the Bush campaign and church leaders would clearly be \nillegal.\" The Washington Post, who actually contacted the IRS to see \nif the activities would cause a church to lose its tax-exempt status, \nwrote that the IRS warned, \"a preference for or against a certain \ncandidate or party  becomes a prohibited activity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso last month, the Bush campaign sent out a letter seeking to \nidentify 1,600 \"friendly congregations\" in Pennsylvania.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time, however, even Bush-friendly evangelicals are resisting the \ncampaign's outreach. According to Reuters, Richard Land said he was \n\"appalled.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"First of all, I would not want my church directories being used that \nway,'' he told Reuters in an interview, predicting failure for the \nBush plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conservative [Southern Baptist] Protestant denomination, whose 16 \nmillion members strongly backed Bush in 2000, held regular drives \nthat encouraged church-goers to \"vote their values,'' said Land.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But it's one thing for us to do that. It's a totally different thing \nfor a partisan campaign to come in and try to organize a church. A \nlot of pastors are going to say: 'Wait a minute, bub','' he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Times's David D. Kirkpatrick, writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard J. Mouw, president of the Fuller Theological Seminary in \nPasadena, Calif., one of the largest evangelical Protestant \nseminaries, said: \"Theologically speaking, churches are really in a \nposition to speak truth to power. But this smacks of too close an \nalliance of church and Caesar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Mouw added that the Bush campaign should not take evangelical \nvotes for granted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I find,\" he said, \"that a lot of church people, including a lot of \nevangelicals, are increasingly nervous about the credibility of the \nBush administration on issues that a year or two ago people were \nready to trust them on, like foreign policy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Rather than just assuming that evangelical churches are ready to \nhand over their membership lists, they would do much better to spend \nsome time trying to convince us that they really do have the \ninterests of biblical Christians at heart.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, even Bush supporters are questioning whether the \nadministration is taking their views seriously enough. Tony Perkins, \npresident of the Family Research Council, wrote in a recent \nWashington Update email,\u0014\n\u0014\na look at the full list of speakers [at the Republican National \nConvention] shows that the convention is lacking in speeches by \nprominent Republicans who can adequately address the social issues \nour nation is facingfrom protecting marriage to defending the \nsanctity of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, many of the people who will have prominent roles at the \nconvention have publicly contradicted the Bush Administration's \npolicies on these very issues; not just Pataki and Giuliani, but also \nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). \nUnderstandably, the Bush campaign would like to portray the \nRepublican Party as a \"big tent\" while the national spotlight is on, \nbut surely there is some room in that tent for social conservatives. \nThe Bush team admits it had trouble fully mobilizing Christian voters \nin 2000. Leaving real conservatives off the convention stage won't do \nmuch to correct that problem in 2004.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerkins has also complained that not enough Christians are standing \nup for the Federal Marriage Amendment. In June, he told The \nWashington Post, \"Standing on Capitol Hill listening, you don't hear \nanything.\" However, when it comes to same-sex marriage at the state \nlevel, church leaders are standing up. Weblog already noted that \nchurches in Oregon worked to support a marriage amendment in that \nstate. (Perkins also noted that on June 30 \"the Defense of Marriage \nCoalition in Oregon turned in over 244,587 signatures supporting a \nstate constitutional amendment protecting marriage as the union of \none man and one woman.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in Kansas, where the legislature recently rejected such an \namendment, churches, upset at the failure to pass the amendment, have \nbanded together to support the causeand are receiving plenty of flak \nfor it. Kansas City Star tells the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpset at the Kansas Legislature for defeating a constitutional \namendment banning same-sex marriage, the Rev. Jerry Johnston, pastor \nof First Family Church in Overland Park, invited area clergy members \nto a meeting this month. About 100 came, he said. Churches, he said, \nmust get more involved in politics. \"God calls a minister to speak on \nmoral issues,\" Johnston said.  \u0014\n\u0014\nMany preachers don't know anything about politics; many don't know \nwho their representatives and senators are,\" said Johnston, who added \nthat he should have gotten more involved in the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches should encourage their members to act, he said. During July, \nhe said, his church and others in Johnson County will hold forums for \ncandidates, register voters, and educate people on the issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnson has been distributing educational materials about candidates \nas local elections approach. In response, a group called the \nMainstream Coalition decided to send 100 volunteers to monitor church \nactivities and sermons to make sure they do nothing illegal. The Star \nwrites, \"Johnston and other ministers should keep partisan politics \nout of the pulpit, said Caroline McKnight, coalition executive \ndirector. 'His job is to lead his flock by setting an example  not \nby bringing the smoke-filled room into his sanctuary,' she said.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUpset about such threats, pastors are fighting back. \"We are alarmed \nat such scare tactics,\" said Ad Hoc Pastors for Biblical Values, \naccording to the Star. \"These are the methods of coercive rulers. \nThere is no place for this type of intimidation by 'secret police' in \nour land.\" The pastors also said, \"We do not recognize the Mainstream \nCoalition as the self-appointed guardians of political and religious \npurity.  Their members share a common social agenda and seek to \nimpose that agenda across this county. Their patronizing attitude \ntoward those whose views differ, and especially toward white, \nevangelical Christians, is distasteful.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the \"he said/she said\" reporting can get confusing, though, and \nleave churchgoers, pastors, and the public ill-informed. In fact, as \nWeblog earlier noted, \"Suggesting that churches are jeopardizing \ntheir tax-exempt status by allowing such an activity is an \nantidemocratic scare tactic. A canard. A lie.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, Weblog has to wonder about media bias when it does not ask \nthe same questions regarding Democrats who speak to churches, or \npastors who openly support Democrat candidates. According to the \nAssociated Press, during the primaries \"Rev. Gregory G. Groover \nrecognized [John Kerry] from the pulpit as \"the next president of the \nUnited States.\" He continued, \"We're thankful that there's going to \nbe a revolution in this country,\" Groover said. \"A new day has \noccurred, a new movement. And so we praise God for the president. And \nwe say: God, bring him on.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf that's not an endorsement of a political candidate by a pastor \nfrom the pulpit, I don't know what is.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso during the primaries, Kerry spoke from the lectern of a \nMississippi church. According to the Boston Globe, \"Kerry, the \npresumptive Democratic nominee, predicted that 'a guy from \nMassachusetts' will beat Bush in the South in November.\" In the \nchurch, Kerry \"read from the Book of James to suggest that \nRepublicans did not back up \"important words\" with good works and \nsocial policy that aided Americans. Kerry said, \"he had been \n'anointed the next president of the United States' after Bishop \nPhillip Coleman laid hands on him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, Kansas and Oregon pastors' activities regarding the \nsame-sex marriage debate is no more of an entanglement of religion \nand government that a bishop anointing Kerry to be the next President.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the IRS, who applies tax-exempt rules to churches, the \nquestion is not whether churches or pastors can get involved in \npolitics, but to what extent, and under what circumstances. The IRS \nhas a handy pamphlet addressing the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pamphlet says,\u0014\n\u0014\nMinister F is the minister of Church O. The Sunday before the \nNovember election, Minister F invited Senate Candidate X to preach to \nher congregation during worship services. During his remarks, \nCandidate X stated, \"I am asking not only for your votes, but for \nyour enthusiasm and dedication, for your willingness to go the extra \nmile to get a very large turnout on Tuesday.\" Minister F invited no \nother candidate to address her congregation during the Senatorial \ncampaign. Because these activities took place during official church \nservices, they are attributed to Church O. By selectively providing \nchurch facilities to allow Candidate X to speak in support of his \ncampaign, Church O's actions constitute political campaign \nintervention.\u0014\nThough churches cannot campaign for candidates or legislation, they \ncan \"involve themselves in issues of public policy without the \nactivity being considered as lobbying. For example, churches may \nconduct educational meetings, prepare and distribute educational \nmaterials, or otherwise consider public policy issues in an \neducational manner without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BABY FACE NELSON",
    "words": "Reviewed by Geoffrey Wawro\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Americans will have at least vague memories of George \"Baby \nFace\" Nelson. Anointed \"Public Enemy Number One\" in July 1934 after \nFBI \"G-men\" gunned down\u0014\nJohn Dillinger on the sidewalk outside Chicagos Biograph Theatre, \n\"Baby Face\" Nelson led the FBI on an epic chase across America until \nhe too was trapped and killed four months later.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo most, the FBIs capture of \"Baby Face\" Nelson, \"Wooden Gun\" \nDillinger, \"Ma\" Barker, \"Machine Gun\" Kelly and \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd \nenshrined the Bureau as an efficient hard-hitting crime-fighter. In a \nDepression-era reprise of Cowboys and Indians, cool, impassive \"feds\" \nrelentlessly tracked the \"auto bandits\"so-called because they used \nthe mobility of automobiles to knock off Midwestern banksand \neliminated them. To magnify the accomplishment, FBI Director J. Edgar \nHoover used vicious rhetoric: the gangsters were given emotive \nnicknames and characterized in press releases as \"trigger-happy \nrunts\" or \"cockroaches.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDubbed a \"small time yellow rat,\" Lester Gillis a.k.a. George \"Baby \nFace\" Nelson was really the attractive son of two hard-working \nBelgian immigrants from Chicago, who drifted into petty crime during \nthe Depression, graduating quickly to burglary and bank robberies. \nHis involvement with Dillingers gang marked him down for execution, \nand, after a four-month manhunt from Chicago to Reno and back \nagainengagingly detailed in this bookthe FBI got him in November \n1934. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is impossible to sympathize with \"Baby Face,\" who did, after all, \nkill coolly and casually when he had to. But this book reminds us of \nsomething important: that J. Edgar Hoover himself was a villain, who, \nto burnish his reputation, maximize his Congressional funding, and \ndeflect attention from his rumored homosexuality, vastly inflated the \nthreat posed by gangsters like Nelson, while covertly deflating the \nreal menace: organized crime. Hoover flatly ignored truly formidable \ngangsters like Al Capone and \"Bugsy\" Moran until forced to confront \nthe Mafia by Robert F. Kennedy in the 1960s. Small-time crooks like \nGeorge \"Baby Face\" Nelson were so much easier to deal with. 416 pages \n 6 2/3\" x 9 1/4\"  selected bibliography  index \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Authors: STEVEN NICKEL is a freelance writer who has \nwritten for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and has appeared on NBCs \nUnsolved Mysteries, A&Es Biography, and documentaries on the \nDiscovery Channel and the History Channel.

    "words": "Moyers in 30 years or less, July 21, 2004\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I am a journalist but I am also a pilgrim,\" Moyers declares in this \neloquent selection of his speeches and commentaries. Although these \n20 pieces have been edited to resemble essays, their origin lends \nthem a rousing urgency, as Moyers relates stories and insights in his \npersonal journey from small-town Texas boyhood to eminent broadcast \njournalist. Whether he's extolling the virtues of participatory \ndemocracy based on the early 20th-century Progressive movement or \nlamenting recent evidence that democracy is on the auction block with \npoliticians bought by special interests, Moyers's ability to \ncommunicate history, philosophy and personal experience \nsimultaneously is impressive. His instinct for enlisting stories to \nget his message across appears throughout this collection, including \ntales from the years he worked for Lyndon Johnson (before and after \nJohnson became President). In a portrait of Johnson's political \nstrengths and personal weaknesses, a less canny storyteller might \nleave out the telling anecdote about LBJ's integrating the Faculty \nClub of the University of Texas in 1964, but not Moyers. The same \ncombination of candor, vividness and forthrightness animating his \nJohnson portrait is what gives such authority to Moyers's arguments \nthat responsible journalism of unquestioned integrity is essential to \nour democratic process and that domination of news media by \nconglomerates, along with trends in celebrity-obsessed journalism, is \nundermining the freedom of the press. Moyers's wisdom, common sense \nand deeply felt principles should inspire and energize many readers \nin the very best way.\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nReviewer: \t  \tJohn Jacobs \"Pen for Hire\" (Tequesta, FL United States) \u0014\n\u0014\n\t\t  \u0014\n\"The soul of democracy has been dying,\" writes Bill Moyers, \"Drowning \nin a rising tide of big money contributed by a narrow, \nunrepresentative elite that has betrayed the faith of citizens ... \nwhere a relatively small handful of the rich decide, with their \nmoney, who will run, who will win, and how they will govern.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat. Just what we needed, another irritating reminder of clouds \nlooming on the horizon of our nation. But before we give up in \nfrustration, let's let Mr. Moyers -- with his thirty years' \nexperience in jouurnalism and politics -- encourage us, and point the \nway back to our democratic heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Moyers on America,\" is his latest collection of speeches and \ncommentaries. Most engage general issues like institutional politics \nor integrity in media, then link these broader topics to more \nspecific examples, such as the Bush administration's public policy \nconcerning Iraq and 9/11. Other essays are more philosophical, and \noutline the high democratic ideals he calls \"the soul of democracy.\" \nLike a scholar, Mr. Moyers presents ideas from history and philosophy \nas \"dots\", then connects those dots to form a \"bigger picture.\" And \nhe does so in plain and readable language that showcases his \nexpertise as a communicator.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"Which America Will We Be Now\", he levels serious accusations \nagainst the Bush administration. \"[In the wake of 9/11,] while \neverywhere Americans' cheeks were still stained with tears... the \npredators of Washington were up to their old tricks in the pursuit of \nprivate plunder at public expense.\" In a passage Michael Moore might \nenvy for its dripping sarcasm, he lambastes the administration for \nusing 9/11 to sneak shady legislation past a mourning public: the \nBush administration opened the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge to drilling, \ngave General Electric a special tax break (\"Don't worry about NBC, \nCNBC, or MSNBC reporting it; they're all in the GE family\"), and \nrelaxed pollution standards.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Bill Moyers wants his readers to know that he does love his \ncountry. (\"I even tuck a Valentine in my tax returns.\") His critique, \nhe writes, \"is balanced by an enduring faith in the progressive \npromise of the nation,\" a faith that evokes the same youthful energy \nthat tipfied the Democratic Party for a short but brilliant time in \nthe 60's.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHis ideas on the citizen's obligations to democracy -- participation \nand activism -- are also typical of that era. \"Stannding up to your \ngovernment,\" he writes, \"Can mean standing up for your country ... \nThe greatest sedition is silence.\" If this is as true today as it was \nin the Vietnam era, then Moyers is here right when we need him, \nbringing his experiences with Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam to bear on \nour war in Iraq. He outlines his views in a piece titled, \"War Is \nWar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMoyers' credentials are hard to overlook when he talks tough about \nintegrity in journalism and bias in the media. As he sees it, thanks \nto the mergers of media outlets, just \"six companies dominate what \nAmerica reads in books, magazines, and newspapers, or watches on \ntelevision and at the movies.\" With the media having nearly Orwellian \ncontrol of what we think about, we may end up living in a cocoon, \nwhere as the old adage goes, what we don't know won't hurt us. We'll \nbe \"consumers\" of celebrity and entertainment \"news\" (geared towards \nbox-office sales) and not citizen readers of the news that's \nimportant to our democracy. Trends in the newsroom back him up: \"More \nthan a quarter of journalists polled said that they had avoided some \nnewsworthy stories that might conflict with the financial interests \nof their news organizations or advertisers.\" His words are even more \nforceful in the light of recent media controversies (eg, Nightline).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also has a way with words. More than a few times, I marveled at \nhow he was able to use pithy sound bites to make his points \nmemorable. Due to bad editing, or maybe because each piece was \nwritten as a speech, sometimes whole sentences didn't seem to make \nsense, even as I reread them: \"The important thing ... is to work it \nthrough yourself: commitment tempered by reason.\" Other sentences \nwere too impressionistic and ended vaguely: \"If character is destiny, \nchoice is history.\" But these criticisms do not outweigh the work's \npatriotic value.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMoyers's distinct appeal is as an \"everyman\" familiar with the \ntypical struggles of working-class people, who without his help, \nmight not as easily concern themselves with the health of their \ndemocracy. Without Moyers, they might be limited to observing that \ntheir government seems -- with each passing moment -- more remote, \nout of touch, and most impoortantly, more outside of their control \nand influence. It's not hopeless, Moyers insists. Democracy is real. \nLet him talk you into it.\u0014\nMoyers Speaks for All of Us, August 25, 2004\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\u0014\nReviewer: \t  \tConstant Weeder \"batttman\" (Los Angeles, CA USA) - See \nall my reviews\u0014\nMoyers, Bill, Moyers on America. New York: The New Press, 2004.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSubtitled, \"A Journalist and His Times,\" the book consists of a \nseries of TV columns and speeches worked into essay form. All of it \nis worth reading, but the parts I liked best were the fiery defense \nof the Constitution, the unmasking of reactionary politicians as \ninhumane and proudly mean-spirited--\"they narrowly defined membership \nin democracy to include only people like them\"--and the comparison of \ntoday's politics with the struggles of the Progressives in the \n1900-1920 era, after which FDR denounced \"economic royalists\" for \nwhat they were. Moyers' point is that the rich have no right to buy \ndemocracy. The politicians of terror \"win only if we let them, only \nif we become like them: vengeful, imperious, intolerant, paranoid, \ninvoking a God of wrath.\" \"Mencken got it right when he said, \n\"Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a \nsign that he expects to be paid for it.\" He denounces the \nconsolidation of the media into a handful of plutocratic oligarchies. \nA statement that has stayed with me, because he repeated it during a \nbook-signing in June 2004, was \"No man is fit to be a master.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The fight between the human scale and the giant scale--between the \nmaster and the governed--left unresolved by the Progressive Era, is \nreturning for some kind of epic confrontation.\" Today our liberties \nare threatened by the punishment of criticism and the distaste for \nvariety or dissent. Our government is a study in bribery, conflicts \nof interest, corruption, and is awash in money from private interest \ngroups.\u0014\nThe media has turned to celebrity journalism, speed over accuracy, \nopinion over reporting, and this in turn is the result of \nconcentrated ownership. (A panel of anchormen at the Democratic 2004 \nConvention admitted that they hadn't asked enough questions before \nvalidating the Bush move for war against Iraq.) \"The job of telling \nthe truth about people whose job it is to hide the truth is almost as \ncomplicated and difficult as trying to hide it in the first place.\" A \n\"deep and pervasive corruption has settled upon the republic.\" Moyers \ncalls this a \"cynical age.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rest of the book relates episodes from Moyers' youth, a tribute \nto cultural literacy, liberal arts education, and contemplations \nabout religion (he is an ordained minister).\u0014\nIn sum, the book is an eloquent denunciation of the imperial state \nnow in the hands of\u0014\nthose with the Top Secret stamp all over government actions. It also \nincludes a tribute to I.F. Stone, and a tip of the hat to poetry, \nwhich formed the basis for one of Moyers' PBS series. Describing an \nauto trip he made with his elderly father, he writes, \"A later \nafternoon sun the size of a prospector's imagination was hanging in \nthe sky as we drove out to their old farm.\" A nice postscript.\u0014",

    "title": "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR",
    "words": "Be Careful What You Pray For\u0014\n\u0014\nThe strange tale of the controversial Bishop Pike and his fatal quest \nfor relevance.\u0014\nReviewed by Michael G. Maudlin | posted 08/30/2004\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those who measure significance by media attention and celebrity \nstatus, the story of Bishop James Pike is a cautionary one. During \nhis peak in the Fifties and Sixties, Pike was one of the most \nrecognized Christians of his time, on par with Bishop Fulton Sheen \nand Billy Graham. From 1955 to 1961, ABC ran a successful \nSunday-afternoon talk show hosted by the bishop, whereas both Sheen \nand Graham failed at weekly shows. Gracing the cover of Time, holding \npress conferences with Martin Luther King, Jr., giving provocative \nquotes to reporters, and enjoying a long run as a bestselling author, \nBishop Pike was the public face of Christianity for many in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich is all the more sobering considering how thoroughly he has \ndisappeared from our cultural radar. David Robertson's biography, A \nPassionate Pilgrim, sets out to bring Pike back into the \nconversation. The subject must have sounded ideal for a biographythe \nstory of an outspoken, thrice-married celebrity Episcopal bishop who \nprophetically voiced support for progressive causes, questioned the \nchurch's doctrines, experimented with drugs, dallied with sances, \nand died in the Israeli wildernessbut one gets the impression that \nRobertson found filling in the details less than inspiring. Pike's \ninconsistencies, his alcoholism, his womanizing, his sophistry in \ngetting out of jams, his overspending (both institutional and \npersonal), his narcissism, and the damage to those around \nhimespecially the suicides of his eldest son, one live-in lover, and \nthe attempted suicide of one daughter: all this makes for a punishing \nchronicle that gets darker as it goes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who remember Pike as a liberal leader may be surprised to hear \nthat he began his career as an agitator on the right. From his first \npulpit in Poughkeepsie, New York, down the street from Vassar, he \nrailed against a liberal chaplain next-door and criticized the \nuniversity's faculty for being \"Unitarian, humanist, materialist, and \nMarxist.\" He even organized talks on campus for browbeating \nevangelists. Not always playing fair, Pike eventually got the \nchaplain fired and raised his visibility enough to get offered a more \nprestigious job: chaplain at Columbia University and chairman of the \nreligion department.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1952, Pike moved next door, becoming dean of the cathedral at St. \nJohn the Divine. To be dean at the world's largest cathedral in the \nheart of Manhattan is a plum position, and Pike made the most of it, \nwith superb instincts for working the media. He picked a fight with \nthe Catholic bishops over their attacks on Planned Parenthood and \ntheir opposition to birth control. When asked to receive an honorary \ndoctorate from Sewanee in Tennessee, he first accepted and then \npublicly turned it down after finding that the university did not \nadmit African Americans into their seminary. Characteristically, Pike \nreleased his letter to the New York Times before it was delivered to \nSewanee's trustees: they heard the news when reporters called for \nreactions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also publicly challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy's claim that \n7,000 U.S. pastors were part of the Kremlin's conspiracy. When newly \nelected President Eisenhower backed up Pike, the scales began to tip \nthe other way for McCarthy and his movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was at St. John's that ABC's \"The Dean Pike Show\" was launched \n(later changed to \"The Bishop Pike Show\") and he became a national \nfigure. Every Sunday, three to four thousand filled the sanctuary to \nhear him preach. Here Pike discovered his vocation as an author, \nusually popularizing other's thoughts but having the knack for \ncatching people's attention. In his new role as spokesman for the \nfaith, Pike strove to make the church \"relevant\" to the culture. He \nbecame an advocate for civil rights, the poor, women's ordination, \nabortion, and homosexual rights, and explained new ideas in theology \nto the masses. While many saw him as an enemy of orthodox \nChristianity, Pike saw himself as a passionate defender of the \nchurch. There is a reason he was asked to offer a prayer at a Billy \nGraham crusade. Throughout his career, he wanted people to encounter \nGod by stripping away unnecessary barriers to the faith. Of course, \nhow one defines \"unnecessary\" makes all the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite frequent rumors of heavy drinking and womanizing, his name \nwas put forth and approved by the diocese of Northern California to \nbecome their bishop. By then Pike needed to mount a full-scale \ncampaign in the house of bishops to get the post. (One issue, which \nhad dogged him before, was the dubious means by which he had obtained \nan annulment of his first marriage, after it ended in divorce in \n1941, in order to remarry in 1942). Ultimately he succeeded. As \nbishop at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, Pike added apostolic \nauthority to his arsenal and put it to use. He became a one-man \necumenical force by recognizing a Methodist minister as having dual \nordination and freedom to serve in the diocese. Later he ordained a \nwoman as a first-order deacon, the preliminary step before full \npastoral ordination in the church (which was not approved until after \nPike's death).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in San Francisco, at the peak of his fame and influence, his life \nbegan to unravel. Though he eventually sobered up through AA, his \nsecond wife filed for separation in 1965 (and for divorce in 1966). \nSoon Pike was openly living with another woman, who later committed \nsuicide after a fight with him. Growing more radical, Pike now \nactively argued against the Virgin Birth, the Trinity, and the \nIncarnation. Heresy procedures were begun in 1962, '64, '65, and '66, \ngrowing in intensity, but each time the church decided it was not in \nthe denomination's best interest to pursue a heresy trial. The \nchurch's reluctance to try the openly heretical Pike demonstrates the \ndemise of this instrument of denominational adjudication.\u0014\n\u0014\nPike stepped down as bishop of Northern California in 1966, the same \nyear his son committed suicide. This led to his explorations of \nsances as a means of talking to his son. Pike was becoming an \nembarrassment to the church. After the death of his lover, he \npartnered with Diane Kennedy, a woman he had already been sleeping \nwith, who was 29 when the 55-year-old Pike first hooked up with her. \nWhen his marriage to her in December 1968 led to church \ndisciplineonce again, one of the issues at stake was the means by \nwhich he arranged an annulment, in this case of his second \nmarriagehe broke with his denomination entirely, claiming that the \nchurch was hopelessly out of date.\u0014\n\u0014\nPike and his new wife found a warrant for their position in a line \nfrom an Essene text translated from the Dead Sea Scrolls: \"This is \nthe time for the clearing of the way into the wilderness.\" As \nRobertson observes, \"This declaration by 1969 had become a personal \nrallying cry for the couple as they disassociated themselves from \ninstitutional religion and a conventional livelihood, and proposed to \nstudy in Israel a historical Jesus far different from the accepted \nview of most of Christianity.\" In April of 1969, while Pike and his \nwife were driving to Qumran, they got lost and their car became stuck \nin the dirt. After ten hours of walking, Diane made it out. Five days \nlater the bishop's body was found.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are we to make of this strange story? No doubt God used this \necclesiastical gadfly to give voice to many just causes. Pike was an \narticulate and witty spokesman for racial equality, the poor, and the \nrole of women in the church. But it all seems so accidental. Pike \nnever seemed to recognize that giving voice to the prophetic makes \nsome private demands on the prophet. And \"relevance\" is a harsh idol, \ndemanding ever-larger sacrifices. Some aspects of the gospel will \nalways be \"foolishness to the Greeks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians in the Fifties and Sixties worried that unless the \nchurch became more visible and more relevant, it would be relegated \nto the cultural sidelines. It is easy to see how Pike must have \nlooked like an answer to their prayers. Perhaps the main lesson of \nthis troubling biography, then, is that we should be careful what we \npray for.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael G.

Neither variety leaves much room for progress or peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesse Jackson was right and Jerry Falwell was wrong ... we should be \nseeking pathways to peace and not further bloodshed or violence. Even \nthe New Testament calls this what it is, an eye for an eye and a \ntooth for a tooth. At what point does resistance cross over and \nbecome revenge?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe errors of the U.S. war on terrorism continue to demonstrate that \nour motives in invading Iraq were mixed with political ambition and \nfueled by intentional misinformation. On the home front, they have \nbeen applauded and endorsed by religious views that have supported \nthe invasion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalwells statements are indicative of a fundamentalism so extreme as \nto be incredulous for many faithful followers of the Prince of Peace.\u0014\n \u0014\nIf Falwell is right and his views endorsed by our political and \nmilitary leaders as the answer to terrorism, we will descend from any \nmoral high ground we might have asserted and will have joined the \nterrorists at their own game. The war will drag down our national \nsense of wanting to lift up and elevate human dignity rather than \ncrush it under the boot of vengeance in the name of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no question that terrorism requires resistance. Those \nresponsible for death and destruction must be confronted. But \nwhatever we do, lets dont kill them in the name of Jesus. Lets do \nwhat is necessary with the least amount of destruction of life as \npossible, and lets do it in the name of freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps Jerry Falwells thinly veiled thirst for bloodshed represents \nthe angry vindictive feeling for many American Christians who are \nfrustrated with the war on terror. The war on terrorism calls forth \nall the ugliness that war invokes.

    "title": "BRIDE OF THE REFORMATION",
    "words": "Bride of the Reformation\u0014\nBy Edwin Woodruff Tait\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nBasel, on the Rhine where France, Germany, and Switzerland meet, was \na bustling hub of commerce and culture in the early 16th century. \nFrom all over Europe, students flocked to its university and writers \nbrought their books to its presses. Chief among the intellectuals of \nBasel was the reformer Desiderius Erasmus. At Basel, in 1515-16, \nErasmus produced his famous edition of the Greek New Testament, \nassisted by younger scholars such as Johannes Oecolampadius, a priest \nwho was working for the Froben printing house, and Wolfgang Capito, \npreacher and theology professor.\u0014\n\u0014\nA marriage of penance?\u0014\nAlso in Basel were Margareta Rosenblatta military wifeand her \ndaughter Wibrandis, who would play an important role in the lives of \nboth Oecolampadius and Capito. The two Rosenblatts moved in \nuniversity-educated circles, from which Wibrandis picked up German, \nLatin, and a husband, Ludwig Keller, whom she married in 1524 at the \nage of 20. Two years later Keller was dead, leaving her with a \ndaughter also named Wibrandis.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Wibrandises returned to live with Grandmother Margareta, and for \ntwo more years they lived in poverty. Meanwhile, they became \nattracted to the evangelical teachings being proclaimed by \nOecolampadius. The former printer's assistant was back in Basel as \ncathedral preacher after a stint as preacher in Augsburg (1518-20), \ntwo years in a monastery (1520-22), and several months as chaplain to \nthe outlaw knight Franz von Sickingen. Capito, meanwhile, had left \nBasel in 1520 for a job with the Archbishop of Mainz, in which \ncapacity he attempted to stall the case against Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus, still in Basel, feared that the \"evangelicals\" were tearing \nthe Church apart. He therefore took full advantage of the possibility \nfor satire when the 45-year-old Oecolampadius married the 24-year-old \nwidow Wibrandis Keller. Oecolampadius, Erasmus quipped, had married \nan attractive girl as his Lenten penance. In Oecolampadius's own \naccount, Wibrandis was a bit too young, but she was a good Christian, \nof respectable family but not too rich, and had \"several years' \nexperience bearing the cross.\" He wrote to Capito the year after the \nwedding: \"My wife is what I always wanted  She is not contentious, \ngarrulous, or a gadabout, but looks after the household.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOecolampadius's fate\u0014\nIn 1529, Oecolampadius and a Protestant mob succeeded in destroying \nthe images in Basel's churches and reforming the Lord's Supper \naccording to Protestant doctrine. Meanwhile, similar changes had \ntaken place in Strasbourg, where Capito had overcome his last qualms \nabout the divisive potential of Protestantism and was working \nzealously alongside the ex-Dominican Martin Bucer. Throughout \nsouthern Germany and Switzerland, a like-minded group of theologians \ntook control of the religious life of some of the region's most \nimportant city-states. They and their wives formed not only a \ntheological but a social circle. Capito had married a local \nmagistrate's daughter, Agnes, at the urging of Bucer. And in turn, \nCapito had urged Oecolampadius to take a wife. Both Elisabeth and \nAgnes corresponded with Wibrandis, as did Anna Zwingli.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis network of friendship would be sorely needed. The Reformation \nhad triumphed in much of Switzerland, but the warlike \"Forest \nCantons\" remained Catholic, and in 1531 civil war erupted. On Oct. 11 \nZwingli was killed in battle at Kappel, and Basel's attempt to help \nZurich and Bern resulted in a second defeat. Oecolampadius had \ndefended the legitimacy of war, but he saw the military disasters as \na sign that Christians should trust in God alone. Weak and \ndiscouraged, Oecolampadius died on Nov. 23, 1531. Bucer commented, \n\"We have no greater theologian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile at Strasbourg, Capito's wife Agnes had died of the plague, \nleaving him a widower with several children. In the 16th century, \nthis situation obviously called for immediate remarriage. Bucer was \nafraid that Capito might marry the widow of a martyred Anabaptist \nleader (a self-proclaimed \"king\"). Capito had Anabaptist leanings and \nwas, in Bucer's view, an impulsive sort. He needed a practical wife \nwho would put up with his eccentricities, provide for his needs, and \nlink him more firmly to the evangelical mainstream. Wibrandis fit the \nbill, and Bucer hoped the plight of Oecolampadius's widow and three \nchildren in Basel would distract Capito from the Anabaptist \"queen\" \nin Augsburg.\u0014\n\u0014\nBucer's plans worked. Capito (over 50 at the time) proposed to \nWibrandis and brought her back to Strasbourg. Once again, Wibrandis \nfound herself living in a major center of the Reformation. \nStrasbourg, even more than Basel, was between worldsbetween France \nand Germany culturally, and between the Reformed and the Lutherans \ntheologically, while it also (for a time) served as the haven for \nAnabaptists and other radicals. Bucer was the dominant figure at this \npoint, negotiating (successfully) for reconciliation with the \nLutherans, and (unsuccessfully) for the formation of a national \nchurch where Protestants and Catholics could join in worship as the \nGospel slowly transformed society. These efforts culminated at the \nill-fated Regensburg Colloquy in 1541, and Bucer returned home to \nfind plague sweeping Strasbourg. In the months that followed he \nwatched four of his five children die, while the Capitos lost two of \ntheirs, besides Wibrandis's son Eusebius Oecolampadius. Then Capito \nhimself and Bucer's wife Elisabeth were both stricken.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Martin and Wibrandis stood by Elisabeth's deathbed, she made them \npromise to marry each other in order to provide for the children of \nboth families. \"We could not answer except by tears,\" Bucer recalled \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\nA very Reformation household\u0014\nIn March of 1542, the 51-year-old Bucer fulfilled his wife's dying \nwish. Bucer was one of the most respected theologians of the \nProtestant world at this point, and traveled frequently. Wibrandis, \nin weak health, managed the household, took care of the children (two \nsurviving from Oecolampadius, two from Capito, and two from Bucer, \nbesides her stepson from Bucer's first marriage) and entertained a \nwide variety of guests. The couple also adopted needy children and \ngave shelter to students and refugees living in Strasbourg. The \nItalian reformer Peter Martyr Vermigli spoke glowingly of the piety \nand order of Bucer's household.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Oecolampadius and Capito, Bucer was restrained in his own \ncomments on his marriage to Wibrandis. He once said that she was \nperfect in every respect except that she did not rebuke him as much \nas Elisabeth had done, and that he now felt the need of Elisabeth's \nplain speaking.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, in 1546, Emperor Charles V mustered his forces and dealt a \ndecisive defeat to the Protestant forces. Forced to sue for peace, \nthe Protestants found themselves saddled with an imperially mandated \ncompromise, the \"Interim.\" They were allowed to continue to preach \nfreely, but they had to give back several churches in each city to \nthe Catholics, and the remaining Protestant churches had to \nreintroduce certain Catholic ceremonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn to England\u0014\nSome Protestant theologians believed that they could conform to this \nin good faith. Bucer did not. He would not have been given the choice \nanyway. The emperor regarded him as one of the principal \ntroublemakers, and Bucer's exile was a condition of the peace treaty \nwith Strasbourg. In 1548, then, he set out accompanied only by his \nassistant Fagius for Protestant England, where he had been offered a \npost as theology professor at Cambridge.\u0014\n\u0014\nBucer arrived in England lonely and discouraged. He was convinced the \nfailure of German Protestantism was due to the sinfulness of the \nProtestants and their failure to practice Christian discipline. He \nproclaimed this message to his English students with a dour prophetic \ninsistence that some of them found dismaying. Meanwhile, he found the \nEnglish winter bitterly cold, and a special German-style stove was \nconstructed for him. The food, he complained to Wibrandis, was \nnothing but meat.\u0014\n\u0014\nWibrandis came to England, looked at the situation, and decided that \neveryone should emigrate. She went back to Strasbourg to make \narrangements, where she narrowly escaped being summoned by a Catholic \nofficial who was trying to confiscate her property (she admitted that \nif she had gone she might have \"said something hot\" which would not \nhave been a good idea). By the end of 1549 she had herded the whole \nfamily to England, in time to nurse Martin through two more difficult \nwinters. In 1551 Bucer died, worn out by his endless activity, \ndiscouraged by the apparent failure of his work, and weakened by the \nclimate. It was left to Wibrandis to organize the Bucer household for \nthe return trip to Strasbourg. But Strasbourg was no longer a haven. \nThe Interim was still in force (though not for much longer) and the \nfamily of a prominent heretic was not safe there. Wibrandis and her \nhousehold therefore returned to Basel, where she lived for more than \n10 years as a much respected matriarch until her death (in yet \nanother plague epidemic) in 1564.\u0014\n\u0014\nA decisiveif supportingrole\u0014\nThough Wibrandis never wrote or spoke publicly, and her husbands \nspoke little of her except to praise her virtue and gentleness, her \nthreat to \"say something hot\" to the intrusive Strasbourg official \nshows another side. The details of the move to England also show her \nto have been decisive and capable, sometimes overruling her ailing \nhusband.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the most part, Wibrandis stood in the backgroundbut what a \nbackground! From the heady beginnings in Basel to the stress and \nbustle of Strasbourg to the wintry gloom of Edwardian England, \nWibrandis played a key (if supporting) role in the unfolding \nReformation. The men she married were among the most moderate of the \nProtestant leaders. They combined learning with reforming fire, and \nagainst great odds they struggled to hold the Protestant movement \ntogether and make it a genuine renewal of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat all three men saw Wibrandis as the ideal helpmate says something \nabout the kind of woman she must have been.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

    "title": "BROKEN, THE TROUBLED PAST AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF THE FBI, BY RICHARD \nPOWERS",
    "words": "Popular historian Powers, biographer of J. Edgar Hoover, has produced \na timely and nuanced history of the legendary agency that puts its \ncurrent struggles in appropriate context. Beginning with the debate \nabout the need for a federal detective force in the early 1900s, \nPowers traces the evolution of a small unit within the Justice \nDepartment into the G-Men of lore. Despite some odd omissions (there \nis no mention of the bureau's role in investigating the \nassassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy or the first \nbombing of the World Trade Center) and a little sloppiness (Rudolph \nGiuliani passed on trying the Mafia Commission in order to try a \npolitical corruption case, not to handle insider trading \ninvestigations), Powers succeeds in showing how the FBI's handling of \nterrorist threats prior to 9/11 was the direct result of the public \nbacklash against Hoover's excesses and a desire to better respect \ncivil liberties. His balanced and reasoned defense of recent director \nLouis Freeh, who has become a convenient scapegoat in the eyes of \nmany, will spark renewed debate, especially as the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission and consideration of reforms of the intelligence \ncommunity remain in the spotlight.\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\n*Starred Review* The failure of our various intelligence agencies to \nunravel the 9/11 plot has now been well documented. Since the FBI had \nthe statutory responsibility for domestic intelligence gathering, \nmost of the blame has fallen on them. Powers, who has written \nextensively on issues of national security and law enforcement, \nasserts that the recent intelligence failures of the FBI can be \ntraced directly back to a form of original sin. The FBI was \nidealistically launched under the administration of Theodore \nRoosevelt, with the purpose of investigating crimes by the rich, \npowerful, and politically well connected. Unfortunately, the bureau \nquickly became a political tool. Powers illustrates how the FBI \nmisused its powers during the Red Scare of the 1920s and the \ncampaigns against labor organizations and civil rights groups. He \nalso describes J. Edgar Hoover's consummate skills of self-promotion \nas agents tracked down \"public enemies\" during the 1930s. Powers \ntends to gloss over some of the great achievements of both Hoover and \nthe bureau, and his links between earlier and current failures is \ntenuous. However, as a history of the nation's most powerful law \nenforcement agency, this work is informative and engrossing. Jay \nFreeman\u0014\nCopyright  American Library Association.

    "title": "BRUTALITY THERAPY",
    "words": "Brutality Therapy\u0014\nLove and art are keys to healing.\u0014\nby J. Carter Johnson in Kitgum, Uganda |\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery week, children from all around northern Uganda arrive at the \nChildren of War Rehabilitation Center with gunshot wounds, missing \nlimbs, broken bones, and mutilated faces. Most are badly malnourished \nand sick. All are emotionally traumatized, frightened of how they \nwill be treated, and profoundly confused about Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOperated by World Vision, the center's work among former child \nsoldiers is so well known that commanders of the Lord's Resistance \nArmy (LRA) tell captive children that the center's staff will give \nthem a lethal injection or poison their food.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen children arrive at the center in Gulu, they trust no one. \nBrainwashed into believing people will kill them for their war \ncrimes, many expect to be executed. Their immense feelings of guilt \nand shame also cause most to feel unworthy of receiving love in the \nname of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorld Vision has rehabilitated 11,500 children since the center's \ninception in 1995. The center has a staff of 40 workers, including 14 \ncounselors on site, another 12 based in outlying areas, 5 community \noutreach workers, drivers, cooks, and other specialists.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost children stay in the program from one to three months, during \nwhich time they receive medical care, nutritional rehabilitation, \npsychological counseling, and vocational training. Counselors also \npresent the true message of Christianity. Workers model Christian \nlove and forgiveness in everything they do with the children, slowly \nshowing them how to forgive the unforgivable in others and in \nthemselves. But it takes time. One reason the center succeeds is its \ngroundbreaking work in psychological counseling for children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAshley Inselman, a World Vision programs officer, seeks to ensure \nthat the rehab program achieves its goals. \"Mental health issues are \na significant part of the healing process. World Vision has really \nbeen groundbreaking in terms of professional, psychosocial healing,\" \nshe says. \"We've come to realize: It's more than just making sure the \nkids know that Jesus loves and forgives them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe children exhibit classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD), including anxiety attacks, nightmares, and \nflashbacks. But in a culture where Western clinical terminology is \nunknown, counselors must act with deep cultural sensitivity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In Africa, we don't call it post-traumatic stress disorder. But \nthat's what it is. The Acholi community has several words in its \nvernacular that describe the various symptoms of PTSD and \ndepression,\" Inselman says.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe symptoms are often severe. A few children in rehab behave \naggressively, and, unsurprisingly, a few become violent. Such \nchildren would challenge the most experienced clinician working under \nthe best of circumstances. But these circumstances are far from ideal.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a few cases, children in the program escaped the LRA years \nearlier, but never received rehab. Their families send them to the \ncenter when their symptoms make life an impossible, daily nightmare. \nMichael Oruni, the center's director, says in one such case, \"A young \nman was brought by his family when he broke bones in both hands \nboxing the walls of their house.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe center's counselors are university trained, and a World Vision \nspecialist also trains the counselors in issues specific to LRA \nviolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially, children are encouraged to express their traumatic \nexperiences through evocative artwork. Through drawings, the children \ntell stories about their lives before, during, and after their \nabduction into the LRA. Eventually, most children will then start \ntalking to counselors individually about what happened to them. But \nsome may take a month or longer before they can talk about their LRA \nexperiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe program also uses small groups. Oruni says, \"Five or six girls or \nboys, similar in age and experience during captivity, are grouped \ntogether and encouraged to talk about what happened and how they feel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The girls will say, 'There's nothing good about me,' or 'I was made \n[a commander's] wife, so I must live on,' and we start there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOlder children are taught vocational trades. Youth who can earn a \nliving are better able to resist the temptation of re-joining the \narmy or beginning a life of prostitution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe greatest spiritual and emotional need the children have is to \nforgive others and to feel forgiveness. That only begins to happen in \na meaningful way when they openly admit the wrongs they have done and \ndecide to release others of their wrongs as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor victims of unspeakable crimes and those who have raped, \nmutilated, and savagely killed othersespecially their own parents or \nsiblingsit is a monumental task. Oruni told ct about one \nunforgettable story of forgiveness between two Ugandan children:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There was a pregnant girl who was abducted with four others. These \nsoldiers killed the other four and spared her because she was \npregnant, but cut off her lips and nose and left her to bleed to \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not long after she came to the center, the boy soldier who mutilated \nher escaped and came also. They both surrendered to Jesus Christ. The \nboy went to this girl and asked her forgiveness. She knew that she \nmust forgive to be forgiven, so she forgave the boy his crime, and \nthey rejoiced together.\" \u0014\nhttp://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/001/19.34.html\u0014",

    "title": "BUT IS THE STORY TRUE?  THE LOST GOSPEL OF JUDAS",
    "words": "April 7, 2006 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                               \nDocument Is Genuine, but Is Its Story True? \u0014\nBy LAURIE GOODSTEIN \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1959, when the Gospel of Thomas was first published in English, \nmany Christians were shocked to learn that any gospels existed other \nthan Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was also the first time that most Christians had ever heard about \nthe Gnostics  Christian communities in the second through fourth \ncenturies whose scriptures and spiritual beliefs barely resemble what \nis now thought of as traditional Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Gospel of Judas, another piece of Gnostic scripture, has been \nreleased in a very different era. It is a time when many Christians \nhave been bombarded by competing claims about their faith and its \nhistory, and some are grappling with how to absorb it all. \u0014\n\u0014\nGnosticism has become practically a household word, largely thanks to \nthe novel \"The Da Vinci Code,\" as well as to scholars of early \nChristianity like Elaine Pagels, who write for a popular audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany more Gnostic Gospels have been translated and distributed  Mary \nMagdalene, Philip, Thomas and even \"The Gospel of Truth.\" Some \nchurches are holding study groups to pick over books on the \n\"historical Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel of Judas is only the latest crumbling parchment to surface \nin the sands of Egypt like an ancient time capsule. Even before its \nformal introduction at a National Geographic Society news conference \nyesterday, scholars have been part of a debate that will soon be \nechoing in churches, on the Web and in Christian publishing. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe real debate is whether the text says anything historically \nlegitimate about Jesus and Judas.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the scholars on National Geographic's advisory committee said \nthe text should prompt a reassessment of Judas. In it, Jesus speaks \nprivately to Judas, telling him he will share with Judas alone \"the \nmysteries of the kingdom.\" Jesus asks Judas to turn him over to the \nRoman authorities so that his body can be sacrificed. \u0014\n\u0014\nCraig Evans, a professor of the New Testament at Acadia Divinity \nCollege in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, and a scholar on the National \nGeographic panel, conjectured that some of the dialogue between Jesus \nand Judas may have been spoken in private, and so did not make its \nway into the New Testament Gospels, which are more likely to treat \nJesus' public statements. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is possible that the Gospel of Judas preserves an old memory that \nJesus had actually instructed Judas in private, and the other \ndisciples did not know about it,\" Dr. Evans said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Pagels, a religion professor at Princeton, said the discoveries \nof the Gospel of Judas and other Gnostic texts were \"exploding the \nmyth of a monolithic Christianity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reaction of other scholars is that the Gospel of Judas is \ninteresting but no challenge to the New Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The manuscript tells us nothing about the historical Jesus or the \nhistorical Judas,\" said Ben Witherington III, professor of New \nTestament interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, \nKy. \"It tells us a lot about a group that were labeled heretics in \ntheir own day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars on all sides agree that the text was probably produced by a \nscribe in a Gnostic community of Cainites  early Christians who \nregarded the traditional villains of the Bible, including Cain and \nJudas, as heroes. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is no evidence that any of these documents ever represented \nmainstream Christianity,\" Professor Witherington said. \"The Cainites \nwere always on the fringes of their own movement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said that unlike the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, \nwhich were written in Christianity's first century, Gnostic works \nwere produced in the second century and afterward. To say that the \nGospel of Judas reveals anything factual about Judas, Dr. \nWitherington said, \"is like saying a document written 150 years after \nGeorge Washington died tells us the inside truth about George \nWashington.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother member of the National Geographic panel of scholars, the Rev. \nDonald Senior, said the Gnostic gospels could undermine Christianity \nonly if many Christians were to adopt the kind of conspiracy thinking \nthat undergirds \"The Da Vinci Code\": that an \"orthodox elite\" of \nearly church authorities suppressed the free-thinking, spiritual \nGnostics \"for the sake of uniformity and conformity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Senior, president of the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago \nand a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which advises the \npope, said the Vatican was unlikely to regard the Gospel of Judas as \na threat. He said that the Roman Catholic Church's likely response \nwould be to \"affirm the canonical texts\" in the New Testament, rather \nthan seeking to refute each new discovery.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the Gospel of Judas suddenly became something that hundreds of \nthousands of Christians were claiming as their revelation and \nscripture, perhaps the church would come out with some kind of \nstatement,\" Father Senior said in an interview. \"But mostly I think \nit's just not even on the radar screen.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe added, \"I'm just glad it wasn't found in a bank vault in the \nVatican.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BOOZER - A TRUE STORY",
    "words": "Taken From: It Takes a Dog to raise a Village.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer lived by his wit and charm in Marine on-St. Croix, a town of \n606 residents about 35 miles north of St. Paul, Minnesota. Not \neveryone approved of his personal arrangementshaving his\u0014\nown bank account, being his own owner (as verified by his dog \nlicense), and being free to roam\u0014\nlike no other dog in town. But when he brought national attention to \nthis little town by being on\u0014\nGood Morning America, who could argue?\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer had his own float in the 4th of July parade, often accompanied \nby the Booz-ettes marching with bones in their ponytails. He once \ncollected six write-in votes for mayor, rode on the paddle wheeler to \ncelebrate Marine's sesquicentennial, and regularly attended the New \nYear's Eve\u0014\ndance and the Octoberfest held at the Village Hall. With no owner, \nyou may wonder how this\u0014\ndog managed to maintain this lifestyle for almost fourteen years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer was mostly basset hound. He had a long muscular body, a beer \nbelly, short legs, and\u0014\nlong floppy ears which alternately touched the ground when he waddled \nalong. Bassets do not\u0014\nwalk: they waddle. They also look dejected most of the time because \ntheir lower eyelids hang\u0014\ndown so far, a reminder that the blood-hound is one of the basset's \nancestors. Boozer was\u0014\nunable to wag his short tail without wagging his whole body from neck \nto tail.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike most dogs, Boozer did not wish to please people; he wanted \npeople to please him. His behavior was predicated on that principle, \nand his life was a testimony to its success. Boozer's\u0014\nother strong characteristics were total self-centeredness and avowed \nindependence. You might\u0014\nsay he was a highly successful street person.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first time I met Boozer, he was lying in the middle of the little \nroad that led to our summer\u0014\ncottage. I stopped the car; he gazed up at me without lifting his \nhead. I honked the horn; he closed his eyes. When I finally drove \naround him slowly, he kept his eyes closed and concentrated on \nignoring me. We quickly learned that Boozer was the new kid on the \nblock. We also were told that\u0014\nhe had \"strange\" ways. Boozer spent much of his time lying in the \nmiddle of the road, moving only when he had an errand of his own to \ndo. Everyonealmost everyonegot used to driving around him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI got used to his ways, but the day Boozer was not in the middle of \nthe road, I knew something\u0014\nwas wrong. We learned that someone had run over him. I do not know \nwho did it and never asked, but most town folk suspected that it was \none of the someones who did not think he was a cute, eccentric \naddition to the neighbor-hood. That was when we discovered that \nBoozer was nearly indestructable. Less than a week after the \naccident, Boozer was right back in the middle of the\u0014\nroad again. Aspirin and rest had done the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nLittle is known about Boozer's puppyhood because his owners turned \nhim in to the Hennepin\u0014\nCounty Humane Society when he was about a year old. Once you got to \nknow Boozer, you could easily understand how this happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Humane Society gave the dog to the University of Minnesota \nVeterinary Hospital. This must\u0014\nhave been a tough time for Boozer, as he was used in studies at a \nresearch lab. Eventually, the\u0014\nlab decided to give the dog back to the Humane Society for reasons \nthat are not quite clear.\u0014\nHowever, Ann, one of the lab workers, had come to love Boozer, so she \nbrought him home to her apartment as his new owner.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething about the apartment displeased him, so he ripped up the \nsofa cushions the first day\u0014\nhe was alone in the apartment. When Ann came home to the mess, she \nhad a serious talk with\u0014\nhim. The next day while Ann was at work, Boozer chewed up a very nice \ndown comforter. Ann's distress with his obvious displeasure did not \ndeter her from trying to find him a good home.\u0014\nSo, thinking he might like to live in the country, Ann gave him to \nher brother, Joe, who lived in\u0014\nMarine-on-St. Croix.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe was delighted to take Boozer because he wanted a good hunting \ndog. Joe kept Boozer\u0014\noutside and did not let him in the house. Next door, however, lived \nthe Moffitt family with a little\u0014\nboy and girl, two and four years old. They loved playing with him and \nthey welcomed him into\u0014\ntheir house when Joe was at work. Boozer loved playing with the \nMoffitt children. He was so\u0014\npleased that he stopped going to Joe's house except for food.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe tried everything to lure him back but he finally gave up. One day \nJoe walked over to the\u0014\nMoffitt's house and said, \"Here's his leash, dog food, and dish. If \nthis is where he insists on living, you take care of him.\" Because of \nthe children, the Moffitts became his new ownersalthough caretakers \nis a more accurate description in view of the subsequent events.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Boozer was not lying in the road, he cruised the entire village. \nHe checked out new residentshuman, canine, and feline. He hung \naround places where he could get a conversation going and, most \nparticularly, he returned to anyone who presented him with food. The \nSt. Croix\u0014\nRiver flows lazily along the edge of town. Most of the town is \nsituated up several steep hills above\u0014\nthe river, so it often took Boozer most of the day to waddle up and \ndown the hills, depending on\u0014\nhow many stops he made.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Boozer cruised, he often picked up other dogs who would cruise \nwith him. Some were\u0014\nstray \"no-goods,\" but some were well-trained dogs who never left \ntheir premises except when\u0014\nBoozer came by. Many owners were furious when they found that their \nanimal had literally been\u0014\nlured away from their yards, sometimes for hours of worry and \nanguish. Such were Boozer's\u0014\nleader-ship qualities in the dog kingdom. We used to call these \ncruising canines \"the town riffraff.\" When these packs of dogs \napproached our house, we got our golden retriever puppy, Ben,\u0014\ninto the house as quickly as possible. We were unsuccessful to the \nextent that Ben caught fleas\u0014\nfrom repeatedly sniffing this motley entourage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral citizens protested Boozer's cruising activities so the city \ncouncil passed a dog ordinance requiring all canines to be controlled \nby leash, tether, or fence. It is probably more accurate to\u0014\nsay that the Council decided to enforce an already existing \nordinance. Boozer was living with the Moffitts when this occurred, so \nthey tied him up in their back yard. What a reaction! Boozer paced\u0014\nand howled for hours on end. A basset's bay is a very persistent howl \nthat humans can tolerate for just so long. With a basset's \nstubborness, Boozer would not stop his baying except for the few \nminutes when he took food and water.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe found it unbearable to be thwarted from his usual daily rounds \nabout town. At 10:00 AM, he\u0014\nwas used to going to the General Store to meet the bakery truck \ndriver who always had a day-old doughnut for him. Incidentally, this \nstore is \"Ralph's pretty good grocery store, where if we don't\u0014\nhave it, you don't need it,\" made famous by Garrison Keillor who \nlived in Marine-on-St. Croix for several years. After getting his \ndoughnut, Boozer would visit some of the men working in town,\u0014\nlocate the old folks with cookies, have clam linguini with the \nSormans, arrive at the elementary school just when the bell rang, and \nfind a kid or two who would share an ice cream cone with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne can understand why he found it unacceptable to be denied these \npleasures. After listening to Boozer's unceasing howling and baying, \nClaudia Moffitt finally set him free in spite of the leash law.\u0014\nIt took him quite a while to forgive her for his ordeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer, always on the alert for a better place to hang out in case \nthings did not go his way, had become acquainted with the new owners \nof the marina, John and Sandy. In addition to their boat slips and \ncanoe rental business, they had a little restaurant in their main \nbuilding. On his earlier visits to the marina, Boozer had noticed \nthat business was briskwith lots of friendly people who were \ngenerous about handing out food scraps. Boozer moved in.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer's canine friends were usually permanent residents of \nMarine-on-St.Croix, dogs who\u0014\nwere followers, not leaders, and dogs who had learned not to cut into \nhis territory. Boozer quietly assessed any canine outsider. His \ndislikes were predicatable. He ignored the meek but took\u0014\naction if he found an outsider intrusive or annoying.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one occasion during the winter when the river was frozen over, two \nhunters became more interested in imbibing than hunting. They were \nalmost directly across the river from the marina.\u0014\nThey had a young black Lab who became bored and decided to look for \naction else-where. He crossed the frozen river and found Boozer \nmusing on a snow covered dock. The Lab wanted to\u0014\nfrolic, but Boozer did not feel playful. Boozer was a serious sort \nand played very little. This young\u0014\nLab went beyond play, however. He was a tease. He danced around \nBoozer, yipping and nipping\u0014\nat his feet.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer finally got fed up, stood, shook the snow off himself, and \nwalked south on the frozen river. Boozer's leadership abilities never \nfailed. The young dog followed him downriver at least a half\u0014\nmile until they were both out of sight. Some hours later, the \ninebriated hunters came to the marina looking for their dog. By then, \nno one knew just where either dog was. The hunters returned to\u0014\ninquire about their dog on two later occasions, but by t hen it \nseemed ominous. Boozer returned to the marina several days later, but \nthe other dog was never found. Since similar incidents had occurred \nin the past, John was convinced that Boozer took such animals on \nwell-calculated long\u0014\nand dangerous journeys.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce, John's suspicion was fairly well confirmed. On a cold snowy \nnight, John drove home\u0014\nthrough the back-hill road. As he came around a curve, he thought he \nsaw a pile of snow move in\u0014\nthe woods. He turned around and drove back to the spot. Suddenly, \nBoozer came waddling through the snow. Behind him was a \nmysterious-shaped white apparition. It turned out to be a neighbor's \ndog, Hoover. The dog was encased in snow and ice and could hardly \nwalk on his ice encrusted\u0014\nfeet. Had he not been rescued when John came along, it was unlikely \nthat Hoover would have ever been seen again. While no human will ever \nknow just what happened on those dangerous\u0014\njourneys, it was pretty clear that they were never dangerous for \nBoozer.\u0014\n\u0014\nRick, the dogcatcher (the animal-control officer in the area), \narrested Boozer periodically when\u0014\nhe could catch him. Some friend always payed Boozer's fine to bail \nhim out of dog jail. While this amused many Marine residents, it \ninfuriated dog owners who were conscientious about\u0014\ncontrolling their animals. Boozer's detractors could not understand \nwhy this town bum could run loose while other dogs couldn't. The big \nproblem, of course, was that Boozer had no owner. No\u0014\none could control him so no one wanted to take full responsibility \nfor him, but at least three\u0014\nfamilies would have done anything for him  and did.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer even got John and Sandy in trouble with the Health Department \none summer. Dogs are\u0014\nnot allowed in restaurants. John would explain to the restaurant \ninspectors that Boozer was not\u0014\nhis dog and that he stayed outside, only occasionally sneaking in \nwith a customer. That worked a couple of times, but John finally was \nfined because the dog always seemed to be there when the inspectors \ncame to check things out. When the inspector decided that the issue \nof the dog's ownership was irrelevant to the issue of health \ndepartment regulations, John did his best to let his customers know \nthat the dog had to stay outside.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne summer Boozer's fleas were so bad that Sandy had to treat him \nwith flea powder. This displeased him so much that he immediately \nleft his beloved marina and returned to the Moffitts. Just to hedge \nhis bets, he also took up with Todd and Dorothy who lived near the \nmarina with their new baby. After all, the Moffitts might tie him up \nagain!\u0014\n\u0014\nSome weeks later, Rick caught Boozer again. Claudia Moffitt bailed \nhim out once more, but this\u0014\ntime she decided something creative had to be done. Boozer needed to \ngo to a veterinarian for\u0014\nshots and heartworm pills, he needed a dog license, he had no real \nowner, and he had no money. Claudia came up with an idea that put him \non national television.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the idea was to have Boozer take financial responsibility for \nhimself. After all, he was now\u0014\nnine years old. She arranged to have his picture taken for printing \non T-shirts. A local photographer took the picture with-out charge, \nbut not without being insulted by Boozer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer either liked you or he didn't. Those of us whom he liked were \nalways flattered by his\u0014\napproval, and those whom he disliked always felt a little inferior \nbecause of his disapproval. The photo session for the T-shirts \nelicited one of Boozer's most ungrateful behaviors. Boozer refused\u0014\nto get in the photographer's car so John had to put him in the car. \nThirty minutes later, Boozer was back at the marina. He had jumped \nout of the car and run away from the photographer.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Claudia went to the studio with him. The picture turned out \nvery well and the Boozer T-shirts sold out. Both year-round residents \nand summer people bought them. The proceeds from the\u0014\nsales were placed in a special Boozer checking account at the Marine \nbank. When someone\u0014\nasked Claudia what would happen if Boozer ran out of money, she \nreplied, \"Well, he'll just have to sell more T-shirts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that did not solve the owner and license business. Even his best \nfriends did not want to get\u0014\nfined for not leashing a dog they did not own. Nor did anyone want to \nhave the whole town disturbed by his wailing whenever he was tied up. \nA solution was found. The county agreed that Boozer's license would \nshow that he was his own owner!\u0014\n\u0014\nWith all the major problems under control, Boozer continued his \nindependent vagabond life. He stayed with people who pleased him at \nthe moment, he had multiple sources of food, he\u0014\ncontinued to drive the dogcatcher crazy, he had his own financial \nresources, and his town was\u0014\nfull of loyal advocates.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery October the people of Marine celebrate St. Francis day in the \ntown square. The Lutheran minister puts on a Franciscan monk's robe \nand blesses all the animals that are brought to him. Sometimes a \nCatholic priest joins him. There are horses, dogs, cats, gerbils, \nbirds, frogs, and whatever living thing a child or adult chooses to \nhave blessed. Each one is blessed individually. Boozer was blessed on \neleven St. Francis days. Many residents thought these annual \nblessings were particularly important for Boozer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer was written up in all the Twin Cities news-papers and appeared \non local television several times. Strangers in town would come \nlooking for him. When Good Morning America did his story, Charles \nGibson introduced the segment with, \"This is the story of a homeless \ndog who lives on\u0014\neasy street.\" They showed his favorite eating spots. They showed his \njail, his T-shirts, and his\u0014\nbank statement. His best friends were interviewed while he gave the \ncamera a studied pose.\u0014\nAfter the show, so many orders came in for T-shirts from all over the \ncountry that Boozer never wanted for money again.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all this, Boozer's celebrity status continued to grow. The town \nwas very proud of his publicity.\u0014\nFuji films came to Marine to shoot his comings and goings for a full \nday. Fortunately, this photo session went better than his T-shirt \nsession. According to John, Boozer had never met any\u0014\nJapanese people before and he just seemed to like their looks and the \nlilt in their voices. There\u0014\nwas a big story about him in the travel section of the London Daily \nMail. Other magazines started coming to town to photograph him. There \nwas even a movie offer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one occasion, he rolled in something so dreadful that he had to go \nto a groomer. When it came\u0014\nto the bill, the groomer said, \"No charge. It's an honor to take care \nof such a celebrity.\" Claudia said, \"You know he can afford to pay \nhis own bills,\" but the groomer would have none of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his later years, Boozer was hit by a car on High-way 95. As he got \nolder, he would rest in the middle of the highway because it was sort \nof midway between his major destinations. It was\u0014\nnothing like lying in the middle of the little road leading to our \ncottage! Every-one thought this\u0014\naccident would be the end. But no, the veterinarian once again took \ncare of him successfully. As before, the veterinarian said, \"No \ncharge. It's an honor to treat such a celebrity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoozer's arthritis started to bother him more and more as he grew \nolder. While he had many\u0014\nfriends who watched out for him, the Moffitts and John and Sandy \nnever stopped their special love and care. During his last year, when \nhe could no longer waddle up and down the hills, they drove him. He \nwould spend a few days with the Moffitts; then the Moffits would \ndrive him to the marina.\u0014\nAfter a few days there, John and Sandy would take him back to the \nMoffitts where the children gave him great big hugs. In October, \n1993, for the last time, Boozer took part in the blessing of the\u0014\nanimals on St. Francis day. The pastor spent a little extra time with \nBoozer that day. Since everyone\u0014\nin town knew that Boozer was old and ailing, it was a special event \nbecause his friends had one\u0014\nlast opportunity to honor him and be grateful for his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot long after this, Boozer was found to have untreatable cancer. On \na very sad day, he was mercifully \"put away\" and buried in an \nunmarked grave in his beloved woods. The next day, all the children \nin Marine wore their Boozer T-shirts to school. The newspaper report \nof his death told his story and quoted some of his friends. \"He was \nthe one person in town who liked every-body.\" Well, almost. Boozer \nhad lived long enough to have lost many of his aged friends. One who \nknew him\u0014\nwell helped us all to reconcile his loss. He said, \"I am sure he is \nup there in people heaven going from one of the old ladies who used \nto feed him to another.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe $350 left in Boozer's bail fund was used for a party to celebrate \nhis life. The marina put up a plaque reading, \"Boozer slept here.\" As \none resident said, \"Now Boozer is a legend.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRuth Gordon\u0014",

    "words": "BECOMING EICHMANN\u0014\nby David Cesarani\u0014\nReview by Gerhard L. Weinberg\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Adolf Eichmann played a major role in the deportation of \nJews to their deaths during World War II and was the central figure \nin a spectacular trial in Jerusalem, there has been no serious \nbiography of him in the 45 years since that trial. David Cesarani, a \ndistinguished British Holocaust scholar, has stepped into this void \nwith a detailed and thorough study. Tracing Eichmanns early life and \ncareer in the hierarchy of National Socialist Germany, Cesarani shows \non the basis of extensive research in numerous archives how Eichmann \nmoved slowly upward. While the rising Nazi made his reputation with \nthose at higher levels by his role in the effort of the Nazi \ngovernment to drive as many Jews out of Germany as quicklyand as \ndespoiledas possible, he became a major figure as the regime turned \nto systematic murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe face of death\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the reader will find here is a careful tracking of the specific \nrole Eichmann played in the procedures to collect Jews all over \nGerman-controlled or influenced portions of Europe to killing \ncenters. Numerous erroneous prior assertions about this important \nfigure in the Holocaust are demolished in the process. At all points \nthe author is careful in his assertions and judgments. This is \nespecially important in Cesarinis study of Eichmanns role in the \napplication of the killing program to Hungary after that country was \noccupied by the Germans in March, 1944. We also see here the efforts \nof Eichmann to continue with the programa much safer assignment than \nthe alternative of service at the frontinto the last days of the war.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike numerous others involved in mass murder, Eichmann was assisted \nby Catholic Church authorities in his flight from the possibility of \na trial to Argentina. Cesarani follows that escape as well as the \nlife Eichmann lived in his new home. There have been prior accounts \nof the spectacular kidnapping and transportation to Israel, but the \nstory is told here in as full a format as is ever likely to be \noffered. The analysis of the interrogations of Eichmann in Israel and \nthen of the trial will not be agreed with by all, but it certainly \nprovides much fruit for reflection and discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nEichmann in Jerusalem\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most original portions of the book is the discussion of \nthe influence of the trial and of the publicity attendant on it. The \nway in which the trial awakened interest in a subject that had \nlargely been ignored inside Germany and in the wider world in the \nfifteen years after 1945 is analyzed here in an original and \nconvincing way. Since he is a harsh critic of what he considers the \nerrors of others, it is unfortunate that Cesarani makes a number of \nmistakes himself. The complete omission of the role of German police \nbattalions in mass murder is only a conspicuous one of these. \nCertainly all readers will get in this book a fair and convincing \npicture of a figure both significant and symbolic of a horrendous \ndescent into the abyss. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: David Cesarani is one of Britian's leading \nhistorians. He is Director of Studies at the Institute of \nContemporary History and Wiener Library. He has written extensively \non Anglo-Jewish history, and the history of Zionism.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER: Gerhard L. Weinberg, William Rand Kenan, Jr., \nProfessor of History Emeritus at the University of North Carolina, is \nthe author of The Foreign Policy of Hitlers Germany and A World At \nArms: A Global History of World War II.

    "title": "BECOMING EICHMANN - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "To the Israeli prosecutor who interrogated him in 1961, Adolf \nEichmann was a fanatical anti-Semite and a central figure in the \nannihilation of the Jews. To Hannah Arendt, he was a dim-witted \nbureaucrat, a cog in the machinery of destruction that was the \nHolocaust. British historian Cesarani, author of numerous books on \nthe Holocaust and Jewish history, offers a more complex and nuanced \nportrait. Based on research into sources that were unavailable in the \n1960s and on the most recent scholarly work on the Holocaust, \nCesarani corrects the historical record on numerous issues. Contrary \nto popular myth, he says, Eichmann had a normal childhood and a \nsocially and professionally successful young adulthood. Eichmann \njoined the SS not because he was a misfit but because, like so many \nGerman and Austrian middle-class men, he found the Third Reich a \ngreat engine of social mobility. Cesarani's biography is convincing \non many counts. But in the end, the broad outlines of Arendt's \nportrait in her brilliant Eichmann in Jerusalem remain standing. \nEichmann may have been more intelligent and skilled than she \nconcluded, but he was the perfect expression of the highly \nbureaucratized and systematic killing process that the Nazis \nperfected. 8 pages of b&w photos, 2 maps. (May 15) \u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nA monumental and groundbreaking biography-the first one in more than \nforty years-of Adolf Eichmann, Germany's architect of the Final \nSolution In charge of the logistical apparatus of mass deportation \nand extinction, Adolf Eichmann was at the center of the Nazi genocide \nagainst the Jews. He was personally responsible for transporting over \ntwo million Jews to their deaths in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other \ndeath camps. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the first account of Eichmann's life to appear since the \naftermath of his famous trial in 1961 and his subsequent execution in \nJerusalem a year later. It reveals that the depiction of Eichmann as \na loser who drifted into the ranks of the SS is a fabrication that \nconceals Eichmann's considerable abilities and his early political \ndevelopment. Drawing on recently unearthed documents, David Cesarani \nshows how Eichmann became the Reich's \"expert\" on Jewish matters and \nreveals his initially cordial working relationship with Zionist Jews \nin Germany, despite his intense anti-Semitism. Cesarani explains how \nthe massive ethnic cleansing Eichmann conducted in Poland in 1939-40 \nwas the crucial bridge to his later role in the mass deportation of \nthe Jews. And Cesarani argues controversially that Eichmann was not \nnecessarily predisposed to mass murder, exploring the remarkable, \nlargely unknown period in Eichmann's early career when he first \nlearned how to become an administrator of genocide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis challenging work deepens our understanding of Adolf Eichmann and \noffers fresh insights both into the operation of the Final Solution \nand the making of its most notorious perpetrator.\u0014\nEichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile living in Argentina in 1960, Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann was \nkidnapped and smuggled to Israel where he was put on trial for crimes \nagainst humanity. The New Yorker magazine sent Hannah Arendt to cover \nthe trial. While covering the technical aspects of the trial, Arendt \nalso explored the wider themes inherent in the trial, such as the \nnature of justice, the behavior of the Jewish leadership during the \nNazi Rgime, and, most controversially, the nature of Evil itself. \u0014\n\u0014\nFar from being evil incarnate, as the prosecution painted Eichmann, \nArendt maintains that he was an average man, a petty bureaucrat \ninterested only in furthering his career, and the evil he did came \nfrom the seductive power of the totalitarian state and an unthinking \nadherence to the Nazi cause. Indeed, Eichmann's only defense during \nthe trial was \"I was just following orders.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nArendt's analysis of the seductive nature of evil is a disturbing \none. We would like to think that anyone who would perpetrate such \nhorror on the world is different from us, and that such atrocities \nare rarities in our world. But the history of groups such as the \nJews, Kurds, Bosnians, and Native Americans, to name but a few, seems \nto suggest that such evil is all too commonplace. In revealing \nEichmann as the pedestrian little man that he was, Arendt shows us \nthat the veneer of civilization is a thin one indeed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Times Book Review\u0014\n\u0014\nIf, in recalling the period, one could shut one's eyes to the scenes \nof brutal massacre and stop one's ears to the screams of \nhorror-stricken women and terrorized children as they saw the tornado \nof death sweeping toward them, one could almost assume that in some \nparts of the book the author is being whimsical.\u0014",

Wynfrith (or Winfrid) \nhad wanted to be a traveling evangelist ever since missionary monks \nhad visited his family's home when he was five years old. He'd given \nup his noble parents' secular dreams for him back in Wessex, England. \nAnd he'd given up a successful life as a Benedictine monkhaving \nwritten the first Latin grammar produced in England, several poems, \nand a treatise on metrics.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow in his early forties, Wynfrith wanted to be a missionary, \nparticularly one to Friesland (in the northern Netherlands).

He sailed away from England for the last \ntime, this time bound to meet the pope in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Gregory II confirmed Wynfrith's call to missions, remarking, \n\"You seem to glow with the salvation-bringing fire which our Lord \ncame to send upon the earth.\" After receiving assurances that the \nEnglish monk would use the Roman, not Celtic, formula for baptism, he \ncommissioned Wynfrith to evangelize both those \"led astray  and now \nserve idols under the guise of the Christian religion\" and those \"not \nyet cleansed by the waters of holy Baptism.\" The pope also changed \nWynfrith's name to Boniface\"good works\"named after a Roman \nChristian martyred in the Arian controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\nZealous axe-wielder\u0014\nHe returned to Friesland and Germany, evangelizing and suppressing \nheresy. While establishing churches and Benedictine monasteries, he \ndestroyed idols, baptized heathens, and opposed \"ambitious and \nfree-living clerics.\" His zeal against heresy often led to ruthless, \nsevere action. He demanded that two heretical missionaries not only \nbe excommunicated, but imprisoned in solitary confinement. Even among \nsympathetic historians today, he has a reputation as \"difficult, \nprickly, and tactless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was equally zealous in his mission against paganism. At Geismar, \nhe found a huge sacred oak tree, a shrine to Thor. He immediately \ntook an axe to it. After only a few blows, the tree toppled to the \nground, breaking into four pieces and revealing itself to be rotted \naway from within.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A great throng of pagans who were there cursed him bitterly among \nthemselves because he was the enemy of their gods,\" wrote Boniface's \nbiographer, Willibald. \"When the pagans who had cursed saw this, they \n[stopped] cursing and, believing, blessed God.\" Boniface used the oak \nto build a chapel, which became the center of his new monastery.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he continued to clash with pagans, heretics, and even fellow \northodox Christians (like the bishop of Mainz, who reportedly was \ntrying to claim the regions evangelized by Boniface as his own), he \nbecame convinced that ecclesiastical reform was an integral part of \nevangelization. No church councils had been held in the Frankish \nrealm for decades before his arrival. Boniface convened five between \n742 and 747. At Boniface's prodding, the councils adopted strict \nregulations for the clergy and condemned local heretics. Eventually, \nBoniface himself was appointed archbishop of Mainz, replacing his \nrival.\u0014\n\u0014\nMissionary again\u0014\nAfter a few years of administration, Boniface again felt Friesland \ncalling him, a land \"he had once deserted in body but never, indeed, \nin his heart,\" according to Willibald. In his late seventies, he \nresigned his post to head north once again. Once again, he and his \nfollowers roamed the countryside destroying shrines, building \nchurches, and baptizing thousands.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne group of these new converts was due to arrive at Dorkum on the \nRiver Borne. But while Boniface and his 52 companions awaited the \nneophytes, a gang of pagan predators arrived on the shore seeking \nloot. Though he had earlier traveled under the armed protection of \nthe Frankish ruler, he was now far beyond its reach. Boniface, at his \nfirst synod, had ensured that clergy would not carry arms, so all he \nhad to defend himself was the book in his arms, which he used as a \nshield.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new Christians, who had fled upon seeing the raiders, returned to \nfind Boniface and his companions slaughtered. Next to their bishop \nlay a copy of Ambrose's writings on The Advantage of Death, with two \ndeep slashes in it. The book is still on display in Fulda, Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, Boniface spent a small percentage of his life as a \nmissionary. His historical significance is found more in his strong \nadvocacy of Roman order in the church, his reform of the Frankish \nchurches, his uniting churches in southern and central Germany, and \nhis revitalizing nominal Christians in northern Europe. But he \nthought of himself mainly as a missionary, as did countless others. \nFrom the eighth century to the eleventh, he became one of \nmissionaries' top role models.\u0014",

Sarbanes\u0014\nSenate Office Building\u0014\n309 Hart\u0014\nWashington DC, 20510\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Senator Sarbanes,\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a native Marylander and excellent customer of the Internal Revenue \nService, I am writing to ask for your assistance. I have contacted \nthe Department of Homeland Security in an effort to determine the \nprocess\u0014\nfor becoming an illegal alien and they referred me to you.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy primary reason for wishing to change my status from U.S. Citizen \nto illegal alien stem from the bill which was recently passed by the \nSenate and for which you voted. If my understanding of this bill's \nprovisions is\u0014\naccurate , as an illegal alien who has been in the United States for \nfive years, all I need to do to become a citizen is to pay a $2,000 \nfine and income taxes for three of the last five years. I know a good \ndeal when I see one and I am anxious to get the process started \nbefore everyone figures it out.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimply put, those of us who have been here legally have had to pay \ntaxes every year, so I'm excited about the prospect of avoiding two \nyears of taxes in return for paying a $2,000 fine. Is there any way \nthat I can apply\u0014\nto be illegal retroactively? This would yield an excellent result for \nme and my family because we paid heavy taxes in 2004 and 2005.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditionally, as an illegal alien I could begin using the local \nemergency room as my primary health care provider. Once I have \nstopped paying premiums for medical insurance, my accountant figures \nI could save almost $10,000 a year. \u0014\nAnother benefit in gaining illegal status would be that my daughter \nwould receive preferential treatment relative to her law school \napplications, as well as \"in-state\" tuition rates for many colleges \nthroughout the United States for my son.\u0014\n\u0014\nLastly, I understand that illegal status would relieve me of the \nburden of renewing my driver's license and making those burdensome \ncar insurance premiums. This is very important to me given that I \nstill have college age children driving my car.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you would provide me with an outline of the process to become \nillegal (retroactively if possible) and copies of the necessary \nforms, I would be most appreciative. Thank you for your assistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour Loyal Constituent,\u0014\nPete McGlaughlin \u0014\n(Get your Forms (NOW)!! Call your Internal Revenue Service \n1-800-289-1040\u0014",

    "words": "Bush Administration Ends Hunger\u0014\n\u0014\nBritt Towery\u0014\n12-04-06 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Department of Agriculture has dropped the word \"hunger\" from its \nannual report. Now 35 million Americans suffer instead from \"low food \nsecurity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a euphemism is almost Orwellian. There are still 10.8 million \nwho suffer from very low food security, missing at least one meal a \nweek. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago, W. Stanley Mooneyham wrote a book titled What Do You \nSay to a Hungry World?\u0014\n\u0014\nMooneyham was then president of World Vision International. Before \njoining World Vision he was special assistant to evangelist Billy \nGraham.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1970s he led a relief convoy into Cambodia. In 1978 he \nhelped persuade governments to assist Vietnamese boat people by \nsearching the South China Sea by ship, saving hundreds who had fled \nVietnam. I visited with him in Singapore and Hong Kong, before and \nafter these experiences, and sensed his burden for the tragedy of \nVietnam and neighboring countries. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was director of missions at San Antonio's Trinity Baptist \nChurch, I invited him to share his vision for a hungry and dying \nworld. He opened our eyes to the truth, just as his book a year later \ndid for many others.\u0014\n\u0014\nMooneyham refutes two myths about hunger and food supply. One myth is \nthat it is impossible to produce enough food to feed the present \nworld population, much less any increase.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe calls this a convenient myth, because it allows us to do nothing \nand still have a clear conscience. It is not going to be easy, but it \nis not impossible. \"A British agronomist says that on existing diets \nworldwide the world could feed about 40 billion people--nearly 10 \ntimes the present population,\" he wrote in 1979, \"if it really put \nits mind to it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second myth about feeding the world is, \"The starving masses are \ngoing to revolt!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Don't you believe it,\" Mooneyham contends. \"They should--but they \nwon't. They can't. How do you mount a revolution when you are too \nweak to get off your cot?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Howard Payne graduate and professor S. L. Harris told me of a \nsmall but important way to help feed the hungry. At first I was \nskeptical, but after visiting the Web site I became convinced. It is \na small thing, but with enough people clicking on it, it no longer \nremains a small thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is what you do: Get on the Internet: www.thehungersite.com. It \nis raises money for charities through sponsors who buy ads on the \nsite. By visiting you can help provide food for the hungry, without \nspending a dime. Every little bit helps. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause we can't do everything or big things is no excuse from doing \nsomething. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe all wish we knew what to say to a hungry world, but too often we \ndo not wish it strong enough to do something. We can give to the \nlocal food banks and distribute meals to the poor elderly. \u0014\n\u0014\nHandouts alone are not enough. Give a man a fish and he has a meal. \nTeach him to fish and he has a life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne tragic development in America has been big corporations pushing \nfoodstuffs lacking in nutrition. More nourishing foods cost more than \nthe working poor can afford, so they get poorer and fatter on fast \nfoods.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can care. We can pray. But our prayers need hands and feet and a \nwill to change the situation. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur conscience can tell us what to say to our hungry--sorry, our \"low \nfood security\"--neighbors.\u0014",

Dec 6, 2006 (AP) A San Francisco man was found dead in \na mountain creek Wednesday, four days after he set out through the \nsnowy wilderness to seek help for his wife and young daughters, \nstranded in a car. \u0014\n\u0014\nA search helicopter spotted James Kim's body about seven miles from \nwhere he set out in Oregon's snowy Klamath Mountains, two days after \nhis wife and two daughters were rescued from the vehicle, stuck on a \nremote road. \u0014\n\u0014\nKim's body was at the foot of the Big Windy Creek drainage, a \nhalf-mile from the Rogue River, where ground crews and helicopters \nhad been searching for days. \u0014\n\u0014\nA tearful Undersheriff Brian Anderson announced the discovery of the \nbody, his voice breaking at one point. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was very motivated,\" Anderson said. \"We were having trouble in \nthere. He traveled a long distance.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe said he had few details about Kim's condition or the immediate \narea where he was found. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe body was to be taken to the town of Central Point for an \nexamination. \u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier in the day, searchers said they had uncovered clues that \nsuggested Kim had shed clothing and arranged it to give searchers \nclues to his whereabouts. They had planned to drop rescue packages \nwith clothing, emergency gear and provisions. \u0014\n\u0014\nKim, 35, was a senior editor for the technology media company CNET \nNetworks Inc.

She told officers that the \ncouple made a wrong turn and became stuck in the snow nearly two \nweeks before. They used their car heater until they ran out of gas, \nthen burned tires to stay warm and attract attention. With only a few \njars of baby food and limited supplies, Kati Kim nursed her children.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe key to finding them, police said, was a \"ping\" from one of the \nfamily's cell phones that helped narrow down their location. \u0014\n\u0014\nRoads in the area are often not plowed in the winter and can become \nimpassable\u0014",

    "title": "BORN FIGHTING  -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Former Virgnia senator and navy secretary Jim Webb (Fields of Fire; \netc.) wants not only to offer a history of the Scots-Irish but to \nredeem them from their redneck, hillbilly stereotype and place them \nat the center of American history and culture. As Webb relates, the \nScots-Irish first emigrated to the U.S., 200,000 to 400,000 strong, \nin four waves during the 18th century, settling primarily in \nAppalachia before spreading west and south. Webb's thesis is that the \nScots-Irish, with their rugged individualism, warrior culture built \non extended familial groups (the \"kind of people who would die in \nplace rather than retreat\") and an instinctive mistrust of authority, \ncreated an American culture that mirrors these traits. Webb has a \ngenuine flair for describing the battles the Scots-Irish fought \nduring their history, but his analysis of their role in America's \nsocial and political history is, ironically for someone trying to \ncrush stereotypes, fixated on what he sees, in almost Manichaean \nterms, as a class conflict between the Scots-Irish and America's \n\"paternalistic Ivy League-centered, media-connected, politically \ncorrect power centers.\" He even excuses resistance to the \n\"Northern-dominated\" Civil Rights movement. Another glaring weakness \nis the virtual absence of women from the sociological narrative. Webb \ninterweaves his own Scots-Irish family history throughout the book \nwith some success, but by and large his writing and analysis are \noverwhelmed by romanticism. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved. --This text refers to an out of print or \nunavailable edition of this title.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn telling the story of the Scots-Irish in America as a robust and \npassionate tale, novelist Webb writes straightforward, no-nonsense, \nreadable history that clips right along while it is also very \npersonal and highly idiosyncratic about a people who, he claims, are \nlargely invisible--taken for granted--to the general public and who, \nseldom thinking of themselves in ethnic identity terms, mostly don't \nknow their culture. Webb maintains that Scots-Irish attitudes form \nthe bedrock of American society, especially among the working class. \nScots-Irish culture has produced American presidents from Andrew \nJackson to Bill Clinton, soldiers from Ulysses S. Grant to George \nPatton, pioneers, preachers, and others whose most common \ncharacteristics may be described as fierce individualism, persistent \negalitarianism, and a strong sense of personal honor. Perhaps the \nmost visible examples of broad and ongoing Scots-Irish legacy are the \nfundamentalist Christianity (a potent combination of Scottish \nCalvinism and headstrong populism) of America's Bible Belt and \ncountry music. Webb begins the Scots-Irish saga in Scotland, where, \nhe says, the Scots-Irish character was formed, moves on to the Ulster \nScots of what is now Northern Ireland, and follows them to the \nAppalachians and points beyond as well as through the American \nRevolution, the Civil War, and up to the present day.

    "title": "BAPTIST WORSHIP WARS",
    "words": "LEARNING FROM BAPTIST HISTORY: The Long History of Baptist Worship \nWars\u0014\n\u0014\nPamela R. Durso\u0014\n12-21-06\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor's note: As part of an emphasis leading up to Baptists' 400th \nanniversary in 2009, EthicsDaily.com is running a series of columns \nby the Baptist History and Heritage Society about lessons from \nBaptist history and why they are relevant today.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorship wars among Baptists have heated up in the last decade. \nControversies involving styles of worship are widespread, and many \nchurches have struggled with whether to have two worship services in \norder to accommodate those who want a contemporary worship experience \nand those who want a traditional worship experience. Other churches \nhave sought to find a middle ground and offer blended services.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat most Baptists don't consider is that worship wars are part of \nour history. Baptists have long struggled with, fought over, and even \nsplit because of worship styles.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 17th century, Baptists in England opposed singing in worship \nand developed intricate arguments against what they called \"a carnal \nexercise.\" Some of these objections to singing may have grown out of \nthe fact that the noise of singing would call attention to Baptist \nmeetings which were banned by English law. But even after the harsh \nlaws against Baptist meeting in England were overturned, some groups \nof Baptists continued to reject group singing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Grantham, an English Baptist pastor, fiercely opposed the \nsinging of hymns in worship. Grantham conceded that the singing of \nPsalms or biblical texts in worship might be acceptable, but he saw \nhymns as human innovations and called on Baptists not to use these \nquestionable innovations in worship. After all, \"set songs\" were as \nbad as \"set prayers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGrantham also opposed the use of \"mixed voices\" or \"promiscuous \nsinging\" in worship, for the practice of congregational singing was \nnot warranted in scripture and therefore must not be done. The \nproblem was that the congregation might include some who were \nnon-Christians and thus the music would be polluted by their \nnon-Christian singing of Christian songs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, Grantham concluded that if a congregation did sing \nPsalms or biblical texts, that singing must be done as a solo. And of \ncourse, the solos must be done only by men, since women had to be \nsilent in worship. He also rejected the use of any musical \ninstruments to accompany singing.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther Baptist leaders were not as intense in their opposition, but \nlike Grantham, they too noted that women should not take part in \nsinging in church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother Baptist pastor in England, Benjamin Keach, had a very \ndifferent understanding of singing in worship and the use of hymns, \nand he helped English Baptists to see the value of congregational \nsinging.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1673, he persuaded his church to sing a hymn at the close of the \nLord's Supper, allowing those who opposed this to leave before the \nsinging began. Six years later, his church agreed to sing a hymn on \npublic days of thanksgiving, and fourteen years after that, his \nchurch agreed to sing a hymn as part of worship every Sunday. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn all, it took 20 years for him to convince his congregation that \nsinging hymns was a worthwhile addition to worship services. Even so, \n22 of his members left when the hymn singing was instituted, and they \njoined a non-singing church.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Baptists continue to differ in their views on worship, but the \nquestions are a bit different. Should congregations sing praise \nsongs? Should they have praise bands? Should they have two services \nor even three to cater to all the worship style preferences of their \nmembers?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many congregations, these questions have been controversial and \ndivisive, and I certainly do not have any wisdom when it comes to \nmaking these decisions or figuring out how churches can survive \nworship wars.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would, however, like to suggest from a perspective of Baptist \nhistory that such disagreements about worship practices are neither \nnew nor should they become catastrophic controversies within a \nchurch. We can learn from Keach that time and patience will \neventually bring resolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nLesson:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists today need to step back from worship wars and gain some \nperspective. A willingness to compromise, to treat with kindness and \nrespect those who hold other views, and to patiently work for \nincremental change when seeking to introduce new ways of worshipping \ncan help Baptists avoid heated conflict and hurtful controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nPamela R. Durso is associate executive director of the Baptist \nHistory and Heritage Society in Brentwood, Tenn.\u0014",

This system had its origins in a \nmedieval monastery, where an Italian monk (rather than an Austrian \nnun) was teaching boys to sing. The monk's name was Guido d'Arezzo \n(born between 990 and 999), and he is one of the musical geniuses of \nthe Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuido was educated at the Benedictine monastery at Pomposa near \nFerrara, and like church choir directors everywhere, he had to turn \nmusically illiterate people into singers who could lead worship. At \nPomposa, he gained a reputation for teaching chants to the singers in \nrecord time. He and his friend, Brother Michael, compiled a book of \nmusical responses (or antiphons) for monastic worship using a new \nsystem of notation.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuido's innovations included a system of naming the notes, based on \nan easy to remember melody. Guido set an existing hymn addressed to \nJohn the Baptist to a new tune. That melody was arranged like Richard \nRodgers's \"Doe, a deer, a female deer.\" The first note was the lowest \nnote of the scale, and each subsequent phrase began one note higher \nthan the previous phrase. Then Guido used the first syllable of each \nphrase to name that note of the scale. The hymn's first phrase was Ut \nqueant laxis. So Guido named the first note ut. The second phrase was \nresonare fibris. So he named the second note re. The hymn had six \nphrases, and so his charges learned to sing, \"Ut, re, mi, fa, sol, \nla.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe chants of Guido's time usually stayed within that six-note range, \nbut a few went further, and so he allowed for a note below (which he \ndesignated by the Greek letter gamma). And thus the range of notes \nbecame known by their first two syllables, gamma + ut, or gamut. That \nexplains why today, when you \"run the gamut,\" you move through the \nentire range of something.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile at Pomposa, Guido also devised a system of lines on which to \nwrite the notes. Before Guido, musicians wrote notes between the \nlines of text indicating by their position whether a melody went up \nor down on a given syllable. But how far up? How far down? That was \ndifficult to tell. So Guido wrote the notes on lines or in the spaces \nbetween them.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuido's practical creativity earned him admiration from other \nmonastic houses in Italy, but jealousy and envy in his own monastery. \nPerhaps because of the bad feelings of his fellow monks, Guido left \nPomposa and moved to Arezzo, where he wrote a book to help train the \nsingers at the cathedral there. His innovative ideas caught the \nattention of the pope, who summoned him to Rome to teach the pope's \nclergy his methods. Guido's reputation and innovations have endured, \nproviding the foundation for almost all music since then.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut how did ut, re, mi become do, re, mi? Once the syllables became \ncompletely independent of their original hymn, some unknown Italian \nof the 17th century thought do sounded better than ut. And he was \nright.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Neff is the executive editor of Christian History & Biography \nand editor of Christianity Today. As music director at his church, he \nunderstands Guido's challenge to teach music quickly.\u0014\nCopyright  2007 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.\u0014",

On July 6, 1975, Ruffian was entered in a match race against \nKentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure; partway through the race \nRuffian broke a front leg and, despite an operation, had to be \ndestroyed.

    "words": "This Month in Our \nHistory...with Fred Anderson\u0014\nJuly 2007 \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery Fourth of July the flags fly from front porches and the bunting \ndrapes many a public building.  The afternoons may be devoted to \nbackyard cookouts or family picnics, but the evening in a town or \ncity worth its salt is ablaze with fireworks.  It is a time of \nnational pride, harkening all the way back to the patriots who \nsecured independence in the American Revolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere were the Virginia Baptists in that time of struggle and \ntriumph?  As individuals, many of the Baptist persuasion were engaged \nas soldiers in the war.  As a people, they were organized and \ncampaigning for full religious liberty.  When the dust settled and a \nnew order emerged, the Virginia Baptists wanted the old system of a \nstate church to be gone, replaced by complete freedom of conscience.  \nThey wanted to be free of any connection between the government and \nan established church.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, they did what they could.  The Separate Baptists \nGeneral Association petitioned the General Assembly to permit them to \nsupply preachers for the Colonial troops, and the offer was \naccepted.  Jeremiah Walker and John Williams, two powerful preachers, \nwent and preached to the soldiers when encamped in the lower parts \nof Virginia.  George Washington himself knew his Baptist neighbors \nand declared that they were uniformly and almost unanimously the \nfirm friends of civil liberty. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe war captured much of the attention of the preachers and people.  \nGreat hopes were placed upon the success of the endeavor.  The growth \nand expansion of the Baptists almost took a second seat to the first \npriority of securing independence from Great Britain and all the \ntyrannical laws which had been imposed.  Some of the key leaders \namong the Baptists fell away, and there was general spiritual decline \namong the Baptist people.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Baylor Semples history of 1810 pictured the situation:  \nPerhaps we may add, that many did not rightly estimate the true \nsource of liberty, nor ascribe its attainment to the proper arm.  In \nconsequence of which, God sent them liberty, and with it, leanness of \nsoul.  The cause of spiritual life languished.  And once peace and \nindependence were won, Semple pinpointed another enemy:  the pursuit \nof economic opportunity and wealth.  Some of the best and brightest \nof the Virginia Baptist clergy removed themselves (and many within \ntheir congregations) to the new western territory of Kentucky. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe love of many waxed cold.  Some of the watchmen fell, others \nstumbled, and many slumbered at their posts.  Iniquity greatly \nabounded.  Associations were but thinly attended, and the business \nbadly conducted.  The long and great [decline] induced many to fear \nthat the times of refreshing would never come, but that God had \nwholly forsaken them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere was the zeal which had persisted so long, especially during the \ntime of persecution?  Some mocked the Virginia Baptists:  Their \nenemies often reproached them.  It seemed that the great movement of \nBaptist growth and development had halted.  Some of the most loyal of \nVirginia Baptists wondered aloud about their downfall.  Semple worded \nit in biblical language:  Oh! That it were with us as in days past, \nwhen the candle of the Lord shined upon us.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then the Lord of the harvest did His work.  In 1785, along the \nJames River, revival fires began to ignite.  It spread, as fire \namong stubble.  Continuing for several years, in different parts:  \nvery few churches were without the blessing: How great the change!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe general revival of the 1780s was emotional in its display.  It \nwas not unusual to have a large portion of the congregation prostrate \non the floor; and in some instances, they have lost the use of their \nlimbs.  Screams, cries, groans, songs, shouts, and hosannas, notes of \ngrief and notes of joy, all heard at the same time, made a heavenly \nconfusion, a sort of indescribable concert.  Even the wicked and \nunenlightened were astonished and said, The Lord hath done great \nthings for this people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe great revival continued from 1785 to at least 1792:  seven years \nof remarkable spiritual experiences.  Thousands were converted and \nthe effect was seen not only among Virginia Baptists, but also among \nthose of other denominations. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs in almost anything, there were positive and negative results even \nto the great revival.  There surprisingly was a decline in the number \nof young persons expressing a call to the ministry.  John Leland \nwondered if it was because the old preachers stand in their way.    \nThe Baptists gained a degree of social recognition and even \nrespectability which carried as much negative as positive results.  \nSomething of the beauty in simplicity and plainness vanished as the \nBaptists began to formalize their worship and adopt the ways of more \nsocially acceptable religious societies.  Party spirit and even \nvanity began to divide Baptists, especially among the ministers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll in all, the Baptists came out the better because of the great \nrevival.  More souls were added into the Kingdom.  With religious \nliberty secured, energy could be directed to evangelism and \neventually to practical missions.  New churches were planted.  Crude \nwooden meetinghouses gave way to brick and stone.  The Virginia \nBaptists were on the rise once again!\u0014",

    "words": "Born on the Fourth of July\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Evans\u0014\n06-28-07\u0014\n\u0014\nThis coming week we celebrate the 231st anniversary of the founding \nof our nation. All across our land there will be fireworks and \nparades commemorating our successful fight to free ourselves from \nBritish rule. And it is absolutely fitting and proper that we should \nremember our national story. I just wish we remembered it better, and \nmore of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Christian and a Baptist, I wish we remembered the religious \ndimension of our revolutionary struggle. In the years prior to the \nAmerican Revolution, Baptists, along with other religious minorities, \nwere scorned and persecuted. Puritans who had fled England seeking \nreligious freedom in the century before the revolution were actively \ninvolved in denying religious freedom to those who dissented from the \nmajority church. At times the persecution became violent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the war began, Baptists joined the ranks of the revolutionary \narmy in droves. They saw the fight for political freedom as also a \nstruggle for religious freedom. These Baptists, led by the likes of \nIsaac Backus and John Leland, knew the dangers of a state supported \nchurch. They completely rejected the idea that America should be a \nChristian nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is how John Leland put it: \"No national church can in its \norganization be the Gospel Church. A National church takes in the \nwhole Nation, and no more; whereas the Gospel Church, takes in no \nNation, but those who fear God, and work righteousness in every \nNation. The notion of a Christian commonwealth should be exploded \nforever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThough small in number, these Baptist leaders wielded significant \ninfluence. They vigorously lobbied the Continental Congress for a \nstrong statement on religious liberty. Here is what James Madison \nwrote to James Monroe concerning the idea of Christianity as \nAmerica's official religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Episcopal clergy are generally for it. The Presbyterians seem as \nready to set up an  establishment which take them in as they were to \npull one down which shut them out. The Baptists, however, standing \nfirm by their avowed principle of the complete separation of church \nand state, declared it to be 'repugnant to the spirit of the Gospel \nfor the Legislature to thus proceed in matters of religion, that no \nhuman laws ought to be established for the purpose.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate became so contentious that Baptists in Virginia began a \nmovement to elect John Leland over James Madison to represent the \nstate at the ratification of the new Constitution. This would have \nbeen a huge embarrassment to the chief architect of the Constitution. \nOnly after Madison agreed to actively support an amendment that \ncalled for religious freedom, free speech, and a free press, did \nLeland drop out and throw his support to Madison.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething singularly important was born as a result of the fight for \nfreedom in our country. For the first time in history religion was \nfree from the influences of the state and vice versa. We have had \nthis privilege for so long that sometimes we forget how difficult it \nwas to achieve.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the close of the convention Benjamin Franklin emerged from the \nmeeting hall and was immediately accosted by a woman. \"Well, Doctor, \nwhat did we get?\" she asked. \"A republic or a monarchy?\" Franklin \nlooked at her and replied, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKeeping our republic requires memory. We must remember how our \nfreedom came to us, and at what cost. We must also remember what that \nfreedom means, especially as it applies to faith. In America, as far \nas the law is concerned, all faiths are created equal.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans, a syndicated columnist, also serves as pastor of \nAuburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, Ala.\u0014",

And so \n10 months ago, with only a seventh-grade education and a suitcase of \nclothes, he was thrown into an unfamiliar world he had been taught to \nfear.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the last six years, hundreds of teenage boys have been expelled \nor felt compelled to leave the polygamous settlement that straddles \nColorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisobedience is usually the reason given for expulsion, but former \nsect members and state legal officials say the exodus of males  the \nexpulsion of girls is rarer  also remedies a huge imbalance in the \nmarriage market. Members of the sect believe that to reach eternal \nsalvation, men are supposed to have at least three wives.\u0014\n\u0014\nState officials say efforts to help them with shelter, foster care or \nother services have been frustrated by the boys distrust of \ngovernment and fear of getting their parents into trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut help for the teenagers is improving. In St. George, a nearby city \nwhere many of them wind up, two private groups, with state aid, have \nopened the first residence and center for banished boys. It will \noffer psychological counseling and advice on things they never \nlearned, like how to write a check or ask a girl out politely, as \nwell as a transitional home for eight who will attend school and work \npart time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe polygamous settlement is largely controlled by the Fundamentalist \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and allies of its jailed \nprophet, Warren S. Jeffs, who is about to stand trial on charges of \nsexual exploitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow 16, living with a sympathetic aunt and uncle, Woodrow is one of \nthe luckier boys, though he rarely sees his parents and says, \nplaintively, I really miss them. Some boys end up in unsupervised \ngroup rentals they call butt huts because of the crowded sleeping, \nwhile others live in cars or end up in jail.\u0014\n\u0014\nUtah officials say they realized the extent of the problem only about \nfour years ago, when they learned that hundreds of boys from the sect \nwere roaming on their own and often in distress. While most have \nconstruction skills to help earn a living, few have more than a \njunior high education.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe house is a milestone, but its just a start, said Paul Murphy, \ndirector of communications and policy for the Utah attorney generals \noffice who has worked with state and private agencies to muster help. \nWere finally reaching out, but its been painfully slow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church settlement is essentially one town crossing the border, a \njumble of walled compounds, trailers and farm fields at the base of \nspectacular red bluffs. Nearly all of the 6,000 residents follow the \ndictates of Mr. Jeffs, who they believe speaks for God; women wear \nankle-length dresses, and children are taught to run away from \noutsiders.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Jeffs, 51, is in the Purgatory jail in southern Utah, his trial \nscheduled to start on Sept. 10 on charges of being an accomplice to \nrape, for his role in forcing a 14-year-old girl to marry an older \ncousin. He faces several other sex-related charges in Arizona.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his allies still control the church, former members say, and \nteenage boys continue to trickle out of the community, by force or by \nchoice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn part its an issue of control, Mr. Murphy said of the harsh \nrules. But underlying the expulsions, he added, is a mathematical \nreality. If youre going to have plural marriage, you need fewer \nmen, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Chatwin, 39, the uncle who took Woodrow in, left the sect 10 \nyears ago. He explained how the expulsions usually happen: The \nleaders tell the parents they must stop this kid who is disobeying \nthe faith and Warren Jeffs. So the parents kick him out because \notherwise the father could have his wives and whole family taken \naway.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sect, which has smaller outposts in other states, has no ties to \nthe mainstream Mormon church, which outlaws polygamy.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders refuse to speak to the press, and the mayors of \nColorado City and Hildale both declined to comment. Mr. Jeffss \ndefense lawyer did not respond to calls or e-mail messages.\u0014",

    "words": "AT FIRST GLANCE, such statements seem to suggest that the process of \nshowing mercy begins with us. That, however, is not the case. It is \nGod who is merciful and gracious, first of all  , and the people of \nGod are who they are because they have received God's mercy. \u0014\nRichard B. Gardner, Matthew\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE TWO TERMS [grace and mercy] are frequently synonymous, but where \nthere is a distinction between the two, it appears that grace is a \nloving response when love is undeserved, and mercy is a loving \nresponse prompted by the misery and helplessness of the one on whom \nthe love is to be showered. Grace answers to the undeserving; mercy \nanswers to the miserable.\u0014\nD. A. Carson, The Sermon on the Mount\u0014\n\u0014\nALL WHO STRIVE to root their lives in forgiveness seek to listen \nrather than to convince, to understand rather than to impose \nthemselves.\u0014\nBrother Roger of Taiz, Glimmers of Happiness\u0014\n\u0014\nA CHRIST-LESS world is a callous world, and mercy was never a \ncharacteristic of pagan life.\u0014\nWilliam Barclay, The Beatitudes and the Lord's Prayer for Everyman\u0014\n\u0014\nIF THEY HAVE any money, [the merciful] don't give till it hurtsthey \ngive till it's gone.\u0014\nClarence Jordan, Sermon on the Mount\u0014\n\u0014\nINVITING the marginalized to the table not only made them equals; it \nmade Jesus their \"friend.\"  The Pharisees viewed this behavior as \nsubversive to their conviction of what Israel needed for true social \nordering; Jesus saw it as a manifestation of a new way of holiness \nbased on mercy.\u0014\nMichael H. Crosby, Spirituality of the Beatitudes\u0014\n\u0014\nGOD WANTS us to be merciful with ourselves. And besides, our sorrows \nare not our own. He takes them on himself, into his heart.\u0014\nGeorges Bernanos, The Diary of a Country Priest\u0014\n\u0014\n[THE MERCIFUL] will be found consorting with publicans and sinners, \ncareless of the shame they incur thereby. In order that they may be \nmerciful, they cast away the most priceless treasure of human life, \ntheir personal dignity and honor.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the only honor and dignity they know is their Lord's own mercy, \nto which alone they owe their very lives.\u0014\nDietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship\u0014\n\u0014\nTHERE ARE no \"good people,\" and the best of us say so the most \nclearly. Saints agree they are sinners; only sinners think they are \nsaints. Only fools demand justice, for where would we be if we got \nit? No, mercy is our only hope from God, and our neighbors' only hope \nfrom us as well.\u0014\nPeter Kreeft, Back to Virtue\u0014",

    "words": "Basil of Caesarea (\"the Great\")\u0014\n                                                             \nPugnacious saint and theologian of the Spirit.\u0014\nby Edwin Woodruff Tait\u0014\n\u0014\nMention the \"church fathers\" to a Western Christian, and Basil the \nGreat (c.330-379) is not usually the first name to come to mind. Yet \neven for the Roman Catholic Church, Basil ranks with his friend \nGregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom as one of the great \npropounders and defenders of the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn around 330, Basil grew up in a world where Christianity was \nrecognized by the Roman government but divided between those who \nbelieved in the full divinity of Christ and the Arians who did not. \nFor much of the fourth century, the Arians would enjoy the support of \nthe emperors. The struggle between Christianity and the empire had \nnot ended with Constantine.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his studies in Athens ended in 356, the young Basil returned to \nhis native city of Caesarea in Cappadocia (southeastern Asia Minor). \nThough he appeared to have a brilliant secular career before him, \ninstead Basil chose to follow the path of his sister Macrina, \nrenouncing his share in the family property and living an ascetic \nlife with a few companions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, Basil was one of the first to establish a monastic community in \nAsia Minor, and the rules he drew up are still normative for Orthodox \nmonks today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 370 he became the archbishop of Caesarea, which brought him into \nconflict with the Arian emperor Valens. In an attempt to intimidate \nthe stubborn bishop, Valens sent the prefect of the imperial guard, \nModestus, to threaten him with punishment. Basil answered that he was \nready and eager to die for Christ, and that he had so few possessions \nthat banishment, confiscation, or imprisonment would mean nothing to \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Modestus complained that no one had ever talked to him like \nthat, Basil answered that perhaps he had never met a bishop before: \n\"When the interests of God are at stake, we care for nothing else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe emperor eventually backed down after his young son took sick and \ndied, but the controversy with the Arians continued for the rest of \nBasil's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 374 Basil wrote a treatise On the Holy Spirit, which fleshed out \nthe orthodox doctrine of the divinity of the Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was while Basil was at Caesarea that the doxology \"Glory be to the \nFather, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit\" was first used, \nplacing all three Persons of the Trinity on an equal footing. Basil \nalso authored a liturgy still used by the Orthodox Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasil's major work of biblical interpretation was the Hexameron, his \nhomilies on the six days of creation. He refused to allegorize away \nthe literal meaning of the text, and is often classed with the \n\"Antiochene\" school of exegesis. Along with scientific speculation \nand theological argument, however, the Hexameron also interprets \nanimal behavior as symbolic of various human characteristics, in \norder to offer moral instruction. Comparing an unhappy couple to a \nviper mating with a lamprey surely does not count as \"literal \nexegesis.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBasil was a difficult man to deal with, even for his friends. He made \nhis friend Gregory of Nazianzus and his own brother Gregory of Nyssa \nmiserable by forcing them to accept positions as bishops of small \nrural towns, positions for which they were not suited. He was accused \nof harshness or pride in his defense of the truth. Yet as bishop he \ndevoted immense energy to feeding the hungry and caring for the poor, \nand his courage and devotion are beyond doubt. Basil's life showed \nthat the heroic, counter-cultural power of the gospel had not been \nstifled by government recognition of Christianity, and that even in a \nstate-sponsored church there would always be found those willing to \ndie for Christ.\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christian History & Biography, or the author.

    "title": "BARRIERS TO COMMITMENT",
    "words": "According to social researchers there are five basic reasons why \npeople fail to make long- term commitments such as marriage. First, \nsome are hurt by a past relationship that came undone in a nasty or \npainful way. \"Once bitten, twice shy\" is the way the modern proverb \nputs it. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, there is a fear of losing our freedom that hammers down the \nbrakes for some, especially men. In the socialization processes of \nadolescence, one of the key components is that of differentiation and \nindividuation. We need to separate ourselves from our parents and \nlearn what it means to be a unique person in our own right. This is \nwhy teens often push back at the controls of dads and moms. It is a \nGod-designed tussle that must be won by the children in order for \neach new generation to emerge from the chrysalis of family identity \nformation. But this newfound freedom can become addictive, especially \nin males. Females by nature are generally more relationally driven. \u0014\n\u0014\nClosely related is the third hindrance to deep relationships: fear of \nlosing individuality. We all crave personal space. No matter where we \nlive in the world, packed into dense urban populations or scaling a \nwilderness mountain peak all alone, we look for some evidence that \n\"I\" is different from \"we.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFear of boredom is the fourth pseudo-barrier to long-term \nrelationships. Change and newness are absolute values in our \nconsumerist culture. A two-year-old cell phone is an antique; a car \nwithout factory-installed GPS is so yesterday; clothes that are too \nshort or too bulky or the wrong color are not intended to be worn out \nin some stewardship contest but must be thrown out. This mentality \nseeps quickly into our relationships. What if I commit to someone and \nfind out that domestic tranquility is dull? What if I say, \"Yes\" to \nyou and find out that I also want to say, \"Yes\" to the person at the \noffice and the one at the gym and the neighbor across the street? How \ncan I commit to you if all I will get from you will be the same old \nsame old, year after year? No thanks!\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, closely related, is the fear of inadequacy in myself. Worse \nthan getting bored with you is the horrific possibility that you will \nget bored with me! During courtship we deliberately strut and preen \nand mime our hypocritical imitations of stars and celebrities and \nwinners and persons of distinction or merit or achievement. But if we \nspend the remaining years of our eternity together, won't the make-up \ncrack and the trophies tarnish and the teeth fall out and the hair \nthin? What if I am not all I promised I would be?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is these trepidations that undermine commitment in our society.\u0014",

    "words": "(CNN) 7/31/08-- As horrified travelers watched, a Greyhound Canada \nbus passenger repeatedly stabbed and then decapitated the young man \nsitting beside him, who was sleeping with his head leaning against \nthe window, a witness said Thursday.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice officers and cars surround the bus near Portage la Prairie, \nManitoba, on Wednesday night.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There was a bloodcurdling scream. I was just reading my book, and \nall of a sudden I heard it,\" said Garnet Caton, who was sitting in \nfront of the two men.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying, I \nguess you could say. I don't think it will leave me for a while.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCaton said he shouted at the other passengers, many of whom also were \nsleeping, to leave. Video Watch Caton describe what he saw \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Everybody got off the bus. Me and a trucker that stopped and the \nGreyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still \nalive or we could help or something like that,\" Caton said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And when we all got up, we saw that the guy was cutting off the \nguy's head. ... When he saw us, he came back to the front of the bus, \ntold the driver to shut the door. He pressed the button and the door \nshut, but it didn't shut in time, and the guy was able to get his \nknife out and take a swipe at us,\" Caton said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaton told The Associated Press the attacker didn't sit near the \nvictim when he first got on the bus, about an hour before the attack.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He sat in the front at first, everything was normal,\" Caton told the \nAP. \"We went to the next stop, and he got off and had a smoke with \nanother young lady there. When he got on the bus again, he came to \nthe back near where I was sitting. He put his bags in the overhead \ncompartment. He didn't say a word to anybody. He seemed totally \nnormal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHalf an hour later, the attack began, Caton told the AP. \"There was \nno rage or anything. He was like a robot, stabbing the guy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe incident happened late Wednesday west of Portage la Prairie, \nManitoba, but a standoff between the attacker and police lasted into \nearly Thursday.\u0014",

We know Your Word says, 'Woe \nto those who call evil good,' but that is exactly what we have done. \nWe have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values. We \nhave exploited the poor and called it the lottery. We have rewarded \nlaziness and called it welfare. We have killed our unborn and called \nit choice. We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable. We \nhave neglected to discipline our children and called it building self \nesteem. We have abused power and called it politics. We have coveted \nour neighbor's possessions and called it ambition. We have polluted \nthe air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of \nexpression. We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our \nforefathers and called it enlightenment. Search us, Oh God, and know \nour hearts today; cleanse us from every sin and Set us free. Amen!'\u0014\n\u0014\nCommentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radio program, 'The \nRest of the Story,' and received a larger response to this program \nthan any other he has ever aired.

    "title": "BOB JONES UNIVERSITY APOLOGIZES ABOUT RACE ISSUE",
    "words": "We all have our blind spots. Clarity often comes only from the \nperspective of hindsight. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's what leaders of Bob Jones University confessed in apologizing \nfor the independent, fundamentalist Christian school's past racist \npolicies. \u0014\n\u0014\nA statement on the school's website reads in part: \"For almost two \ncenturies American Christianity, including BJU in its early stages, \nwas characterized by the segregationist ethos of American culture. \nConsequently, for far too long, we allowed institutional policies \nregarding race to be shaped more directly by that ethos than by the \nprinciples and precepts of the Scriptures. We conformed to the \nculture rather than provide a clear Christian counterpoint to it. In \nso doing, we failed to accurately represent the Lord and to fulfill \nthe commandment to love others as ourselves. For these failures we \nare profoundly sorry.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfrican-American students were not permitted to attend the school \nuntil 1971 - some 17 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \nBrown v. Board of Education that public school segregation was \nunconstitutional. Only within the last decade has BJU dropped its \npolicy forbidding interracial dating. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words: the secular Court interpreting a secular Constitution \nreached the right conclusion about God-given human equality well \nbefore these devout Christians interpreting the Bible they hold as \ndivine truth. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most significant aspect of this confession is found in the words: \n\"We conformed to the culture rather than provide a clear Christian \ncounterpoint to it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe continuing tragedy of fundamentalist American Christianity is the \nunwillingness to learn from mistakes. Past failures do not seem to \nbring any humility that would recognize the possibility of \nmisinterpretations of the biblical revelation in the present or \nfuture.\u0014",

For example, Burt \nLancaster turned down the lead in Ben-Hur in 1959. The role of Judah \nBen-Hur eventually went to Charlton Heston, who won an Academy Award \nand added another hit to his career of blockbusters. \u0014\n\u0014\nNext, for a long while, Sean Connery was a fan-favorite to play \nGandalf, the venerable wizard from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the \nRings. However, Connery rejected the part in Peter Jackson's recent \nadaptation, in part because he did not want to spend 18 months \nfilming in New Zealand. Instead, Sir Ian McKellen took up Gandalf's \nbeard to wide acclaim. After the massive success of the first film, \nThe Fellowship of the Ring, Connery was asked if he regretted his \ndecision. \"I had never read Tolkien,\" he said, \"and the scriptwhen \nthey sent it to me, I didn't understand bobbitshobbits.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, who had bought \nthe film rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, originally \napproached Cary Grant about playing the part of 007. Grant declined \nbecause he did not want to become involved in a film series. Instead, \nSean Connery was cast as Bond, starting with Dr. No in 1962. The \nseries was more than a bit successful.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, Orion Pictures acquired the film rights to Silence of the \nLambs in 1988 because Gene Hackman had expressed an interest in \ndirecting and writing the screenplay for it. He was also booked to \nstar as serial killer Hannibal Lecter, with Michelle Pfeiffer taking \nthe role of agent Starling. By mid-1989, Hackman had dropped out of \nthe project, and Pfeiffer declined the part after deciding that the \nfilm was too dark. When Silence of the Lambs was made in 1990, the \nlead roles were played by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. Both won \nAcademy Awards for their performances. \u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, both Ewan McGregor and Will Smith declined the role of Neo in \nthe blockbuster science fiction epic The Matrix. The part eventually \nwent to Keanu Reeves, and turned into one of the most successful \nmovie trilogies of all time.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Bette Davis turned down the role of Scarlett O'Hara in the \n1939 classic, Gone with the Wind. Instead, the role went to Vivien \nLeigh. Davis thought that her co-star was going to be Errol Flynn, \nwith whom she refused to work after the two had just finished \nshooting The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex.

That show transformed Lisa's life, costing her a good \nbusiness, a beloved fianc, and a comfortable home in Portland, Ore. \n but giving her a chance to save lives in Congo.\u0014\n\u0014\nI found myself stepping with Lisa into a shack here. It was night, \nthere was no electricity, and a tropical rainstorm was turning the \nshantytown into a field of mud and streams. Lisa had come to visit a \nwoman she calls her sister, Generose Namburho, a 40-year-old nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenerose's story is numbingly familiar: extremist Hutu militiamen \ninvaded her home one night, killed her husband and prepared to rape \nher. Then, because she shouted in an attempt to warn her neighbors, \nthey hacked off her leg above the knee with a machete.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Generose lay bleeding near her husband's corpse, the soldiers cut \nup the amputated leg, cooked the pieces on the kitchen fire, and \nordered her children to eat their mother's flesh. One son, a \n12-year-old, refused. If you kill me, kill me, he told the \nsoldiers, as his mother remembers it. But I will not eat a part of \nmy mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo they shot him dead. The murder is one of Generose's last memories \nbefore she blacked out, waking up days later in the hospital where \nshe had worked.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's where Lisa enters the story. After seeing the Oprah show on \nthe Congo war, Lisa began to read more about it, learning that it is \nthe most lethal conflict since World War II. More than five million \nhad already died as of the last peer-reviewed \\mortality estimate in \n2007.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody told her that the atrocities continued because nobody \ncared. Lisa, who is now 34, was appalled and decided to show that she \ncared. She asked friends to sponsor her for a solo 30-mile \nfund-raising run for Congolese women.\u0014",

There \nwas a theory of the time that the babbling of infants was, in some \nmysterious sense, related to the ancient language of Eden, but that \nchildren lost this oldest of all mother-tongues as they grew and \nlearned the language of their parents. Frederick devised an \nexperiment to test this theory. He had his scientists take some \nnewborn, orphaned babies, and isolate them from all physical contact \nwith human beings. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe babies would be kept in separate rooms, with no contact with each \nother. Not a word of language was to be spoken in their presence. \nSpecially trained nurses would see to the babies' physical needs \n--feeding them and making sure they stayed warm -- but they were \nforbidden to pick them up and embrace them. Once the children grew \nold enough to speak, they would be brought into the presence of the \nother children in the experiment, to see if they could converse with \none another. The experiment was an utter failure. Not one of those \npoor children lived beyond infancy -- let alone to the age when \nlanguage begins to develop in earnest. The one thing King Frederick \nlearned from his cruel and ill-considered experiment was that the \nphysical touch of another human being is essential to life. If babies \nare not picked up, and hugged, and caressed, they have but a slim \nchance of surviving to maturity.\u0014",

They were especially bothered that \nLuther, Zwingli, and Calvin retained the practice of infant baptism, \nwhich effectively automatically admitted newborn citizens of their \ncountry into their churches. This still left the state determining \nwho was and wasnt a Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nFelix Mantz was one of those radical reformers who was a Baptist \nbefore Baptists were officially born. In 1523, he was sentenced to be \ndrowned for his commitment to believers baptism, or the idea that \nonly believers in Christ should be baptized. Led through the streets \nof Zurich, he preached to the people as he walked. His old mother and \nbrother, brushing away their tears, walked by the side of the \nexecutioners cart exhorting Felix to suffer bravely for Jesus sake. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the same time, the Catholic Church of England was splitting, \nthanks to the shenanigans of King Henry VIII who wanted to illegally \nannul his first marriage and start another. Soon the Anglican Church \nof England was up and running. And it wasnt long before members of \nthat Anglican Church called Puritans began complaining about the \ncorruption of their church. They were called Puritans because they \nwanted to purify the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nNon-separating Puritans believed the Church of England was still \nthe true church of Christ, and worth saving if it could just be rid \nof the remaining residue of the Catholic Church. Separatist \nPuritans believed the Church of England was rotten to the core and \nbeyond reform. King James Ithe same king who authorized the famous \nKing James Version of the Bibletook a dim view of these rebellious \nPuritans, especially the Separatists, and he began vigorously \npersecuting them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, many Puritan Separatists fled to Holland to escape this \npersecution, including a former Anglican pastor named John Smyth. \nSmyth eventually teamed up with another English refugee named Thomas \nHelwys. Helwys was a relatively affluent businessman who apparently \npaid for the passage of many English Puritans to Holland. Convinced \nthat believers baptism was the only authentic New Testament form of \nBaptism, Smyth and Helwys decided to form their own church in a \nbakery in Amsterdam in the year 1609. John Smyth baptized himself \nfirst, then Helwys, and then several other followers through a \nprocess called affusion, pouring water upon himself and others three \ntimes in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so, according to most Baptist historians, when John Smyth \nbaptized himself he became the first official Baptist in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, John Smyth did not remain a Baptist long. After \nresearching a nearby Mennonite church, he became convinced that the \nMennonites were even closer to the New Testament than the newly \nformed Baptists, so he applied for membership in a Mennonite church. \nMeanwhile, Thomas Helwys remained faithful to the original Baptist \nvision, and eventually moved himself and his fellow Baptists back to \nEngland where they became the first British Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust before leaving Holland, Helwys wrote a book entitled, The \nMystery of Iniquity. When he returned to England, he mailed a copy to \nKing James. On the flyleaf of the book he wrote this famous \ninscription:\u0014\n\u0014\nHear, O King, and diligently note the counsel of the poor, and let \ntheir complaints come before you.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe King is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power \nover the immortal souls of his subjects, to make laws and ordinances \nfor them, and to set spiritual Lords over them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the King has authority to make spiritual Lords and laws, then he \nis an immortal God, and not mortal man.\u0014\n\u0014\nO King, be not seduced by deceivers to sin so against God, whom thou \noughtest to obey, nor against thy poor subjects who ought and will \nobey thee in all things with body and life and goods, or else let \ntheir lives be taken from the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod save the King.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost scholars agree this statement by our Baptist founder Thomas \nHelwys was the first statement advocating about religious liberty \nwritten in the English-speaking world. In his book Helwys argues for \nthe unthinkableevery person, even the heretic, should be free to \nmake his or her own mind up about faith, without pressure or \npunishment from kings or bishops or churches. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, King James did not agree, and he had Thomas Helwys thrown \nin prison, where he spent the rest of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, this new spirit of freedom spread to the New World of \nAmerica, though it did not develop here without difficulty. Both \nNon-Separating and Separatist Puritans came to the shores of America \nin the early 1600s, and it wasnt long before the Non-Separating \nPuritans were persecuting the Separatist Puritans. When one of those \nSeparatist PuritansRoger Williamswas thrown out of the \nMassachusetts Bay Colony for his religious beliefs, he started the \nfirst Baptist church in America in Rhode Island in 1639. Oddly enough \nthe first Baptist in America followed in the footsteps of the first \nBaptist of Europe as he eventually left the Baptist church. But the \nfledgling Baptist movement took root, and began to spread throughout \nthe colonies despite fierce persecution from the Congregational \nchurch in the north, and the Anglican church in the South. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams himself abandoned Puritanism and the Baptist church he had \nhelped found (the first in America), opposing all sects and creeds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom a sermon by David Hughes 10/29/09  (Pastor at First Baptist \nChurch, Winston-Salem, NC)\u0014",

    "words": "When Bernard joined a monastery, it was not one of the old, \nwell-established and rich abbeys, but Citeaux, of the newly-founded, \nreform-minded Cistercians. He brought with him thirty other recruits. \nWith that kind of zeal, it is not surprising that three years later \nhe was appointed abbot of his own monastery. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe monastery was as yet only in the mind. He and twelve followers \nset out to build it. On this day, June 25th, 1115, in an isolated \nvalley in Champagne, France, he founded the famed monastery of \nClairvaux. As was true of other Cistercians, he sought a return to \nthe strict rule of St. Benedict. Bernard disciplined himself so \nstrictly with fasts and hard work that his health was permanently \ndamaged. His followers had to appeal to him for a relaxation of the \nstern regimen, for they could not bear the austerities he demanded of \nhimself and of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite this, Clairvaux grew so rapidly that it soon founded sister \nmonasteries. Bernard himself founded 70. These in turn founded \nothers. Thanks to his zeal, the Cistercian order was among the \nfastest growing order of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis stirring sermons lent impetus to Cistercian growth. Catholics and \nProtestants alike have held his writings in high esteem. Protestants \nhave an especial regard for On Grace and Free Will, a carefully \nreasoned treatise on the perplexing subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard was spiritually minded. His teachings focus on love and \nholiness. They are saturated with allusions to scripture and, indeed, \nthe Cistercians gave prominence to God's word. Bernard also discussed \nthe role of the Holy Spirit. He argued vehemently against those, like \nAbelard, who would introduce a spirit of doubt into theology. He \nwanted God to be known and adored. Many spiritual hymns are \nattributed to him, for example:\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the very thought of thee,\u0014\nwith sweetness fills my breast;\u0014\nbut sweeter far thy face to see\u0014\nand in thy presence rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time Bernard was a practical and active man. Not only \ncould he cause monasteries to spring up where none had been before, \nbut he also took part in the affairs of his day. He preached in \nsupport of the Second Crusade. It failed. He threw all his influence \nbehind Innocent II against rival claimant Anacletus II. Thanks in \nlarge part to Bernard, Innocent II was acknowledged as true pope. \nBernard wrote the rule for the new order of the Knights Templars, \nsworn to defend the Holy Land. He sent hundreds of influential \nletters to the leaders of his era and made peace between a French \nking and his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what became of Clairvaux? After the French Revolution, its cells \nceased to house monks and housed prisoners instead.\u0014",

So it is that Mr. Allen and a cadre of other \nblack pastors, priests and other religious leaders have bonded \ntogether in recent weeks to fight what they see as a potentially \ndevastating blow to their communities: Proposition 19, the California \nballot measure that would tax and regulate marijuana. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn doing so, Mr. Allen and his followers have opened a new, \npotentially crucial front in the battle over Proposition 19, pitting \nthose afraid of more widespread use of the drug versus those who see \nlegalization as an exit strategy in the war on marijuana. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Allen has been particularly critical of Alice A. Huffman, the \npresident of the California branch of the N.A.A.C.P., who has been \nvocal in her support for the measure, casting it as a potential \nvictory for civil rights that could help reduce the number of young \nblack men jailed on marijuana-related offenses. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm not encouraging anyone to recreationally use marijuana, said \nMs. Huffman.

    "title": "BLENDING BIBLE CONTENT AND LIFE APPLICATION",
    "words": "How then can we strike the right balance in our preaching between \nbiblical content and life application? The basic principle is to give \nas much biblical information as the people need to understand the \npassage, and no more. Then move on to your application.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe distinction between exegesis and exposition is helpful here. \nExegesis is the process of getting meaning from the text, often \nthrough noting the verb tense or where the word emphasis falls in the \noriginal languages. That's what you do in your study as you prepare. \nBut it's seldom appropriate in a sermon on Sunday morning. In fact, \nan overuse of Greek or Hebrew can make us snobs. Using the jargon of \nmy profession can come across as a putdown, a way of saying, \"I know \nsomething you don't know.\" There's an arrogance about that that can \ncreate distance between me and the audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nI served for ten years as a general director of Christian Medical and \nDental Society. Sometimes physicians would use technical medical \nterms when they talked with me, and I wouldn't know what they were \ntalking about. Once I said to one of my friends, \"I hope you don't \ntalk to your patients as you do me, because I don't know the jargon. \nI'm an educated person. I just don't happen to be as educated in \nmedicine as you are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you know what he said to me? He replied, \"Preachers do that in the \npulpit all the time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI did a lot of that when I first got out of seminary. I used my \nknowledge of Greek and Hebrew in the study and in the pulpit. One day \na woman wounded me with a compliment: \"I just love to hear you \npreach. In fact, when I see the insights you get from the original \nlanguages, I realize that my English Bible is hardly worth reading.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI went home asking myself, What have I done? I'm trying to get people \ninto their Bibles, but I've taken this lady out of hers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurgeon was right: the people in the marketplace cannot learn the \nlanguage of the academy, so the people in the academy must learn the \nlanguage of the marketplace. It's the pastor's job to translate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile raw exegesis doesn't belong in a Sunday morning sermon, what \ndoes belong there is exposition. Exposition is drawing from your \nexegesis to give the people what they need to understand the passage. \nThey don't need all you've done in exegesis, but they do need to see \nthe framework, the flow of the passage. They should be able to come \nback to the passage a few weeks after you've preached on it, read it, \nand say, \"Oh, I understand what it says.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BAPTISM--ESSENTIAL SACRAMENT OR SYMBOLIC ORDINANCE",
    "words": "In 17th century England, our earliest Baptist views were forged \nwithin a specific context. The English Church, like the Roman \nCatholic Church in this regard, still understood communion and \nbaptism as sacramental rites (vehicles of salvation-grace). Infant \nbaptism, for example, was an initiatory, regenerative act that \nassured salvation to the babe through the vows of the godparents on \nthe child's behalf. After hearing these vows, the priest would give \nthanks that the child was now regenerate and grafted into the body \nof Christ's Church and pray that Almighty God would incorporate him \ninto thy holy Church. The law of the land required all citizens to \nbelieve in this method of salvation and families to have their babies \nduly baptized. To refuse either to believe this notion, or to have \none's newborn baptized, was cause for arrest, fines or imprisonment, \nas early Baptists knew well. \u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Baptists did not believe in baptismal regeneration for many \nreasons. Infants were still incapable of vowing to follow Christ, and \ntheir sureties, or godparents, equally incapable of vowing such an \neternally binding spiritual commitment for the babe. Baptists also \nresisted the stress placed upon the outward act to the extent that \nthe act itself was made necessary for salvation. Neither did Baptists \nagree that both faith and baptism were necessary for salvation to \noccur. Baptists held that both faith in and obedience to Jesus Christ \nwere required for true discipleship. At the same time, Baptists did \nnot believe that the act of baptism was a symbol stripped of meaning, \nas did the early Quakers at the time, who discarded both water \nbaptism and the Lord's Supper as external rites having no efficacy. \nInstead, Baptists offered a carefully considered baptismal theology \nbased upon their study of the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      --Karen Bullock\u0014",

    "words": "September 2, 1415 \u0014\nBohemian Nobles Send Bishops a Defiance\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nA full century before the Reformation under Martin Luther made \nGermany a Protestant nation, a similar movement swept Bohemia. The \nBohemian reformation was destined to collapse, however. Its noble \nleaders, Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague, were burned at the stake after \nunjust trials before the Council of Constance. Their followers, \nrepresenting many conflicting interests, could not stick together \nbecause of internal squabbles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe revolution began when Jerome of Prague visited Oxford. He \nreturned to Bohemia carrying the teachings of John Wycliffe. The \npopular preacher, Jan Hus, picked up these ideas and spread the \ngospel according to Wycliffe. Like Wycliffe, he took the Bible for \nhis guide and rejected certain teachings that could not be found in \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe serfs of Bohemia responded with joy, for the Bible seemed to \npromise a new order of liberty and equality, symbolized by their \nparticipation not just of the bread of communion, but also in the \nwine. Persecuted Christians, such as the Waldenses, embraced Hus' \ndoctrine, for it was as Bible-centered as the followers of Peter \nWaldo had tried to be. Nobles saw church reform as a means to shake \noff the grip of the German invaders who ruled Bohemia at that time, \nand who were still Roman Catholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Hus perished in a pyre of flame with a hymn on his lips, and \nlove for Christ in his heart, the nobles of Bohemia responded with \nfury. On this day, September 2, 1415, an assembly of Bohemian and \nMoravian notables sent the Council of Constance a document signed by \n500 of their prominent men, declaring they would fight to the last \ndrop of their blood to defend what they saw as the true doctrines of \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nFight they did. They butchered the anti-Hussites that King Wenceslaus \npacked onto Prague's New Town council. When Pope Martin V launched a \ncrusade against them, Czechs swarmed into national armies for the \ndefense of their homeland. Under the brilliant military leadership of \nJan Zizka, they defeated several larger forces. Victorious on the \nfield of battle, they proceeded to slaughter monks and Germans alike \nand tried to impose their religious views by force of arms. Most of \nBohemia fell under their control.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then the revolution disintegrated. In about twenty years, \nconflicting ambitions, unfulfilled promises, and lawlessness \nfragmented the alliance. Frightened by the chaos, much of the upper \nclass returned to the Roman church. Even so, a breakaway church \nsurvived. The Unity of the Brethren (Moravians) held true to their \nbeliefs amidst the chaos; and, despite fierce persecution, they \nrefused to be stamped out.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\"Bohemia\" in Encyclopedia Americana.

    "words": "November 9, 1731 \u0014\nBenjamin Bannaky Met Racism in America\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, November 9, 1731, a boy was born on a farm near \nBaltimore, along the Patapsco river. The child had a disadvantage: he \nwas born black in a society that held black slaves. However, because \nhis mother was free, he also was free: slave mother, slave child; \nfree mother, free child. He was named Benjamin. Benjamin Bannaky.\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin's grandmother, Molly, had come from England to America as an \nindentured servant. After fulfilling her term of service, she bought \nthe farm on which Benjamin was born. At the same time she bought two \nslaves to help her work it. Later she freed both and married one, \nBanna Ka. Their daughter, Mary, bought a slave named Robert, whom she \nalso freed and then married. Benjamin was their son.\u0014\n\u0014\nMolly taught Benjamin and his brothers and sisters to read, using the \nBible as a textbook. Benjamin learned to play the flute and violin. \nWhen a Quaker school opened nearby, he attended. The schoolmaster \nchanged the boy's last name from Bannaky to Banneker.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt fifteen, Benjamin took over operation of the family farm and \ndevised a system of ditches and dams that watered it year around from \nnatural springs. The Banneker's fine tobacco crops were the envy of \ntheir neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin proved to be a polymath. A polymath is a person who excels \nin many fields of endeavor. Taking apart a watch, he studied its \nworkings and carved a wooden clock based on the principles he \nlearned. It kept good time for forty years. Joseph Ellicott, an \nindustrialist, asked Benjamin to build him a similar clock, which he \ndid. The Ellicott brothers became Benjamin's close friends and loaned \nhim books from which he taught himself astronomy and mathematics. He \nlearned so well that he predicted an eclipse correctly when prominent \nastronomers and mathematicians got it wrong. In time, Benjamin became \nfamous for the almanacs he issued between 1792 and 1802.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Benjamin may be most famous for a contribution he made to the \nnation when he was sixty. He was helping the Ellicott brothers lay \nout Washington, D. C. as the nation's capital. The architect in \ncharge of the city plans was Pierre L'Enfant. Because of his \nbad-temper, L'Enfant was dismissed from the post. He took his plans \nwith him. Benjamin recreated them from memory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jefferson considered black people mentally inferior. To prove \nhim wrong, Benjamin sent him a copy of his almanac. In the \naccompanying letter, he argued against slavery on the basis of his \nChristian beliefs: \"...it is the indispensable duty of those, who \nmaintain for themselves the rights of human nature, and who possess \nthe obligations of Christianity, to extend their power and influence \nto the relief of every part of the human race, from whatever burden \nor oppression they may unjustly labor under...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...and it is under a sense of the most profound gratitude to the \nSupreme Ruler of the Universe, that I now confess to you, that I am \nnot under that state of tyrannical thraldom [bondage], and inhuman \ncaptivity, to which too many of my brethren are doomed, but that I \nhave abundantly tasted of the fruition of those blessings, which \nproceed from that free and unequalled liberty with which you are \nfavored; and which, I hope, you will willingly allow you have \nmercifully received, from the immediate hand of that Being, from whom \nproceedeth every good and perfect Gift.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson replied politely, but did nothing to end the slave system.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBedini, Silvio A.

    "title": "BLAISE PASCAL'S CONVERSION",
    "words": "November 23, 1654 \u0014\n\u0014\nBlaise Pascal's conversion\u0014\n\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever we see a genius who has many talents--Leonardo da Vinci, \nThomas Jefferson, or Benjamin Franklin, for instance,--we call that \nperson a Renaissance man. Blaise Pascal of France was a Renaissance \nman. He was a prominent mathematician, physicist, inventor, and \nChristian writer. He made important contributions to geometry, \ncalculus, and helped develop the theory of probability. Pascal's law \nis the basis for hydraulic operations. At l9, he invented the world's \nfirst mechanical calculator. The computer language known as PASCAL \nwas named after him.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal grew up accepting the Bible as God's word, but in a rather \nabstract way. He looked into Jansenism, a Catholic reform movement \nthat emphasized the Augustinian (and Calvinist) concept of grace. \nNonetheless, he lived with a sense of spiritual desperation. \nDisgusted with himself he once wrote: \"If one does not know himself \nto be full of pride, ambition, concupiscence, weakness, pettiness, \ninjustice, one is very blind. And if, knowing this, a man does not \ndesire to be delivered, what can one say to him?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, November 23, 1654, Pascal's horses bolted and plunged \noff a bridge. Pascal was thrown into the roadway. He saw this as a \nwarning directly from God. That night he experienced a Christian \nconversion that would cause his outstanding scientific work to take \nsecond place in his pursuits. Light flooded his room. He recognized \nJesus, the Word. For the rest of his life Pascal carried around a \npiece of parchment sewn into his coat--a parchment inscribed with \necstatic phrases:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers \nand scholars...Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy...'This is life eternal \nthat they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom \nyou have sent.' Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ...May I not fall from him \nforever...I will not forget your word. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that day forward, Blaise Pascal realized even more deeply that \nhe must live primarily for God. He started out by giving much more to \nthe poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal closely associated himself with the Jansenists, a group of \nCatholics that emphasized morality in all aspects of life. In 1657 \nPascal published his Provincial Letters which criticized the moral \nteaching of the Jesuits, the rationalism of Descartes, and \nMontaigne's skepticism; and which urged a return to Augustine's \ndoctrines of grace. Voltaire described the collection as \"the first \nwork of genius to appear in France,\" (meaning the first such in \nFrench colloquial literature); it continues to be recognized as such.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal also wrote that we come to know God's truth not only by \nreason, but even more through the heart by faith. It is through our \nheart that we come to know God and to love Him. It is by faith that \nwe can come to know Christ--and God alone gives us faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBell, Eric Temple.

    "words": "In his Church & Culture blog, James Emery White shares this story: \nThe barracks where Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsy were kept in \nthe Nazi concentration camp Ravensbruck were terribly overcrowded and \nflea-infested. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey miraculously had been able to smuggle a Bible into the camp, and \nin that Bible they read that in all things they were to give thanks, \nand that God can use anything for good. Corrie's sister Betsy decided \nthis meant thanking God for the fleas. This was too much for Corrie, \nwho said she could do no such thing. Betsy insisted, so Corrie gave \nin and prayed to God, thanking Him even for the fleas. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the next several months, a wonderful, but curious, thing \nhappened. They found that the guards never entered their barracks. \nThis meant the women were not assaulted. It also meant they were able \nto do the unthinkable, which was to hold open Bible studies and \nprayer meetings in the heart of a Nazi concentration camp. Through \nthis, countless numbers of women came to faith in Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly at the end did they discover why the guards had left them alone \nand would not enter their barracks. It was because of the fleas. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe give thanks to God for every good and perfect gift (James 1:17), \nbut also thank Him for how He will use all things for good in the \nlives of those who trust Him (Rom. 8:28). In this time of declining \nhome values and rising unemployment, in a time when many are facing \nphysical and emotional challenges, there can be little doubt that \nsuch a trusting prayer of gratitude will be challenging to consider. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you feel that challenge, take a moment and remember the fleas of \nRavensbruck; and thank God anyway.\u0014",

    "words": "December 3, 298 \u0014\nCassian and Marcellus Beheaded for Their Bold Stand\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe merry-making was at its height that July, 298. The troops in \nNorth Africa celebrated Emperor Maximian's birthday with feasting and \ndrinking. As usual, there were sacrifices to the emperor, who was \nranked with the gods.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not everyone was in a party mood. Marcellus, a centurion (officer \nover a hundred men) surveyed the scene with disgust. He had reached a \ncrisis. As a convert to Christianity, he knew that Maximian, however \npowerful, was a mere man. Christ alone could be ruler of his heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbruptly, he stood. In front of all the men, he removed his military \nbelt and threw it down. \"I serve Jesus Christ the Eternal King,\" he \nsaid loudly. He also flung down his vine-switch, the insignia of his \nrank. \"Henceforward I cease to serve your Emperors, and I scorn to \nworship your gods of wood and stone, which are deaf and dumb idols. \nIf such be the terms of service that men are forced to offer \nsacrifice to gods and Emperors, behold I cast away my vine-switch and \nbelt, I renounce the standards, and refuse to serve.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAstonished, his fellow soldiers seized him. To their ears, Marcellus' \nwords were not only blasphemy but insubordination and treachery. They \ndragged him before the local governor, Anastasius Fortunatus. \"Throw \nhim into prison,\" said Fortunatus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the feast was over, he called Marcellus out. \"What did you mean \nby removing your military gear in violation of military discipline \nand throwing away your belt and vine-switch?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMarcellus replied boldly. \"...I made answer openly and in a loud \nvoice that I was a Christian and that I could not serve under this \nallegiance, but only under the allegiance of Jesus Christ the Son of \nGod the Father Almighty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunatus said he could not pass over this insubordinate conduct. He \nwould report the matter to higher authorities. That is how Marcellus \nfound himself in Tangier (now a city of Morocco), on October 30th, \nstanding before Aurelius Agricolan. Agricolan heard the evidence. \n\"What madness possessed you to cast away the signs of your \nallegiance, and to speak as you did?\" asked Agricolan.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarcellus answered: \"There is no madness in those who fear the Lord.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter more arguments and threats, Agricolan dictated this sentence: \n\"Marcellus, who held the rank of centurion of the first class, having \nadmitted that he has degraded himself by openly throwing off his \nallegiance, and having besides put on record, as appears in the \nofficial report of the governor, other insane expressions, it is our \npleasure that he be put to death by the sword.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to ancient tradition, based on an appendix attached to \nMarcellus' court records, the man taking the dictation was the \nstenographer, Cassian. The verdict seemed so unfair to him, that he \nthrew down his pen with an exclamation and refused to write another \nword. Agricolan ordered him thrown into prison, too. On this day, \nDecember 3, 298, Cassian followed Marcellus to death, beheaded for \nhis bold stand.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nFremantle, Anne, ed. A Treasury of Early Christianity.

    "title": "BESTSELLING AUTHOR, JOHN BUNYAN",
    "words": "November 28, 1628 \u0014\nBestselling Author, John Bunyan\u0014\nCurtis, Lang, Peterson\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bunyan was born in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England on this day, \nNovember 28, 1628. His home was a small thatched cottage, and his \nfather was a tinker, who spent his days pushing a cart along the \nroads, stopping at homes to fix metal pots and pans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung John received a grammar-school education, but like most sons of \nhis day, he learned his father's trade. During the English Civil War \nhe served as a soldier-- probably on the Puritan side. At nineteen he \nmarried, and his Christian wife led him to try to reform his life. \nBut John found himself constantly slipping back into old habits. \nThough he lived well enough to impress his neighbors, he described \nhimself as a \"painted hypocrite.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1651, John began attending an independent meeting at Bedford and \nwas moved by the pastor's intense biblical preaching. He began to \npore over the Scriptures, until the conflict within him ended in the \nassurance of God's grace in his life. Salvation had come to John \nBunyan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined the Bedford congregation and began to preach there, amazing \npeople at the abilities of a \"mere\" tinker. Though King Charles II \nhad at first promised freedom of religion, increasingly the Anglican \nchurch became England's only accepted church. Dissent was not \nencouraged, and in 1661 the authorities sent John to Bedford jail for \nhis preaching. His times in prison were hard on his family and his \nblind daughter. He remained there until 1672, when Charles issued the \nDeclaration of Indulgence, extending leniency to non-Anglicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his release, the Independent meeting house called him as their \npastor. He received a license to preach and became known as Bishop \nBunyan-- perhaps becoming the organizing genius of Independents in \nthe area, But the toleration was not to last.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1675 Bunyan again found himself in prison, and began his greatest \nwork: The Pilgrim's Progress. This allegory of salvation and the \nChristian walk has given us such colorful phrases as \"Vanity Fair,\" \n\"the Slough of Despond,\" \"House Beautiful,\" \"Muckraking,\" and, \n\"Hanging is too good for him.\" Drawing only on his own experience and \nthe Bible, this largely unlettered preacher created a captivating \npiece of literature that appeals to those who travel - or would \ntravel - on the spiritual pilgrimage from the City of Destruction to \nthe Celestial City.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps because so many readers experienced the same sort of \npilgrimage in their lives, The Pilgrim's Progress, became the world's \nbest-selling devotional book. Bunyan describes the most intimate \nstates of the Christian soul. His realization of the depth of God's \ngrace in his own life gave Bunyan an ability to speak to many people, \neven generations, of their own spiritual state. Bunyan's other works, \nGrace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, The Life and Death of Mr. \nBadman, and The Holy War, never achieved the popularity of The \nPilgrim's Progress. This one humbly written work touched thousands of \nlive sand became a classic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's book Dates With Destiny by \nCurtis, Lang and Petersen.

This landed him in a \nconcentration camp and cost him his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nSafe in exile in America, he abruptly returned to Germany. \"I have \ncome to the conclusion that I have made a mistake in coming to \nAmerica. I shall have no right to participate in the reconstruction \nof the Christian life in Germany after the war if I did not share in \nthe trials of this time with my people. Christians in Germany face \nthe terrible alternative of willing the defeat of their nation in \norder that civilization may survive, or willing the victory of their \nnation and thereby destroying civilization. I know which of these \nalternatives I must choose. But I cannot make that choice in \nsecurity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Germany Bonhoeffer worked with the underground resistance. He \nhelped guide Jews to safety. Believing that Hitler was like a madman \n\"driving a car into a group of innocent bystanders,\" he joined a plot \nto kill the Fhrer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he was arrested for his aid to the Jews, his role in the plot \nwas discovered. There was little hope he would survive Nazi wrath. \nNonetheless Bonhoeffer was personally at peace. Suffering, he said, \nhad become a better key for understanding the world than happiness \nhad ever been.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day February 7, 1945, he was transferred to the terrible \nBuchenwald Concentration Camp where many thousands of prisoners died, \nsome under cruel medical experiments. Three months later Bonhoeffer \ncorpse was added to the list of dead. He was hanged days before the \nallies freed the camp. He had fulfilled his own theology, aptly \nexpressed in his book The Cost of Discipleship: \"The one thing that \nmatters is practical obedience. That will resolve [man's] \ndifficulties and make him free to become the child of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the government usurps God's place, what is the Christian to do? \nBy his life and death, Bonhoeffer exemplified one solution.

    "title": "BAPTISTS AND HELL",
    "words": "BAPTISTS AND HELL\u0014\nby Bruce T. Gourley\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Baptists are dismayed over a new book released this month by \npopular young preacher Rob Bell. Southern Baptist seminary presidents \nand theologians have condemned the book, as have other well-known \nCalvinist ministers. By denying that hell is a literal place of \neternal torment, and daring to suggest that persons can be right with \nGod without uttering the name of Jesus, Bell has been labeled a \nheretic by fundamentalist detractors who never appreciated his \nemergent church emphasis in the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rhetoric echoes that of the American antebellum and Civil War \nera, when biblical literalists insisted that slavery was biblical and \nthat only liberals, heretics and infidels would deny Gods written \nwill for the races.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, we know how that ended: when (in the minds of many white \nBaptists of the South) Gods southern Confederate kingdom lost the \nwar and the evil North thwarted scriptural truth and Gods will for \nthe races, biblical literalists quietly turned their attention \nelsewhere (namely, premillenial dispensationalism, biblical \ninerrancy, and an anti-science crusade).\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the reality is that biblical literalists have always been \nselective in their application of literalism to scripture. \nFurthermore, if one presses even further back in Christian history, \none discovers that biblical literalism became a popular method of \nscriptural interpretation only about five hundred years ago; prior to \nthe Protestant Reformation, allegory was the dominant method of \nbiblical interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, half a millennium into the era of biblical literalism and 150 \nyears or so removed from the slavery fiasco, todays (selective) \nliteralists are taking their stand on the concept of a literal, \neternal hell, labeling dissenters as heretics.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first glance, drawing a line at the gates of hell may seem like a \ngood defensive posture for fundamentalists. After all, the Bible \nrepeatedly talks about hell, right?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, actually, no. To the contrary, the word hell is nowhere to be \nfound in the ancient biblical texts, nor did the word exist in \nbiblical times. Hell is an English term with eighth century Norse \norigins, and only began appearing in biblical translations around the \nsixteenth century (at about the same time that biblical literalism \nbecame popular, in fact). The English hell, some 500 years ago, was \nadopted and used in the place of four biblical words: sheol, hades, \ntartarus, and gehenna.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese four biblical words were used to describe: 1) the grave (the \nHebrew word sheol); 2) the Greek underworld and the god of the \nunderworld, Hades (hades)  early Christians used hades to \ntranslate the Hebrew sheol; 3) a yet deeper Greek mythological \nunderworld and deity that existed beneath hades (tartarus); and 4) \nan earthly place where children were sacrificed by fire in a \nreligious ritual and/or a continually burning garbage dump in the \nground (gehenna).\u0014\n\u0014\nNot until centuries after the penning of scripture did Christians \nbegin to systematically develop a theology of the afterworld \nunderground. St. Augustine in the fifth century claimed that no one \nknew where hades was, yet speculated it was beneath the earths \nsurface. Even so, he primarily focused on hades as the state of being \napart from God. In the sixth century, St. Gregory the Great expressed \nuncertainty, noting that some Christians believed hades was somewhere \nupon the earth, and others believed it was inside the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, in medieval times a fully-developed concept of the \nnetherworld of fiery torment emerged. Nonetheless, some Separatist \nand early Baptist writers in the late sixteenth and seventeenth \ncenturies avoided using the word hell when referring to an \nafterlife apart from God, instead using the phrase eternal \ncondemnation (or similar phraseology).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, that which is typically envisioned as hell by many \nChristians today owes more to Greek mythology and medieval authors \n(such as Dante) than the Bible itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nHence we come full circle to Rob Bell, one of many Christians over \nthe past two or three centuries who have pointed out the fallacies of \nbelieving in a literal hell that is a netherworld of fire and \nbrimstone in which the unsaved will be eternally punished. That \nmany of todays Southern Baptist theologians choose to place their \nfaith in Greek mythological and medieval imagery is troubling. Rather \nthan letting the Bible speak for itself, such rhetoric indicates a \nlack of biblical and historical knowledge on their part, or perhaps \nwillful deception.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an earlier era, hoisting slavery aloft as the mark of biblical \northodoxy proved disastrous for white Baptists of the American South. \nIn the twenty-first century, loyalty to a Greek mythological and \nmedieval-infused concept of a literal, eternal, brimstone and \nfire-laden hell signals that truth is optional, while leading \nmodern Baptists further down the path of irrelevance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, while Baptists liberal to fundamentalist should examine the \ntheological concept of hell, we must do so in a biblical and \nhistorical context. Otherwise, our debates have little theological \nsubstance and are detached from reality.\u0014",

    "title": "BOOK ON GANDHI STIRS PASSION IN INDIA",
    "words": "GANDHI is still so revered in India that a book about him that few \nIndians have read and that hasnt even been published in this country \nhas been banned in one state and may yet be banned nationwide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem, say those who have fanned the flames of popular outrage \nthis week, is that the book suggests that the father of modern India \nwas bisexual. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe books author, Joseph Lelyveld, does write extensively about the \nclose relationship Mohandas K. Gandhi had with a German architect, \nbut he denies that the book, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His \nStruggle With India, makes any such argument. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview Mr. Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The New \nYork Times and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, said he thought \nhe had treaded very carefully with the information, which he knew \nwas delicate. \u0014\n\u0014\nI lived in India, and theres an Indian word called tamasha, he \nsaid, which translates to spectacle. Im surprised to find myself \nat the center of one, because I think this is a careful book, and I \nconsider myself a friend of India. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, this week Gujarat, the state where Gandhi was born and grew \nup, banned the book after reviews and news articles about it appeared \nin Indian newspapers. Gujarat is particularly conservative  alcohol \ncant be sold in there, for instance  and the state is governed by a \nHindu nationalist party. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe writing is perverse in nature, Narendra Modi, the chief \nminister of Gujarat, said of the book after the ban. It has hurt the \nsentiments of those with capacity for sane and logical thinking. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndias law minister, M. Veerappa Moily, said on Tuesday that the \nbook denigrates the national pride and leadership, which he said \ncould not be tolerated. Officials will consider prohibiting the \nbook, he added. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe crux of the controversy seems to be the intersection of two \nsubjects on which Indians have strong views: sexuality and Gandhi. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the first point India is quite conservative, but the recent rapid \ngrowth of its economy has helped loosen attitudes, especially among \nthe large youth population. In 2009 the Delhi High Court struck down \na British-era law against sodomy, a ruling seen as a watershed for \ngay rights. Nevertheless most gay Indians would not feel comfortable \ncoming out. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the second, Gandhi is revered even by the young, but there is \nlittle significant understanding of the nuances of his philosophy and \nlife. He has been mostly reduced to an idol. Young Indians dont \nspend much time studying him. And many of his ideas, like the \ndevelopment of small-scale village industries, have faded. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat doesnt mean Gandhi cant be a figure of fun. A few years ago he \nwas made a character in the Munna Bhai film franchise, about a \ngangster in Mumbai; the character is visited by Gandhi, who tells him \nto change his ways and give up violence. Its a comedy. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe controversy also highlights Indias highly circumscribed right to \nfree speech. Indian officials frequently ban and censor books, \nmovies, art and other works. Under Indian law any citizen can \npetition to have a work banned, and activists and political leaders \nfrequently exercise that right. But it is uncommon for even a book a \nyear to be banned nationally. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe constitution allows the government to impose reasonable \nrestrictions on speech that might be construed as offensive. In 1988 \nIndia joined many Muslim countries in banning The Satanic Verses, \nthe novel by Salman Rushdie, a native of India. Last year the Shiv \nSena, a regional political party, forced the University of Mumbai to \nremove Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry from its curriculum, \narguing that this acclaimed novel denigrated the dominant \nMaharashtrian ethnic group.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain subjects, like Gandhi, who is often referred to as mahatma, \nor great soul, are particularly guarded. Gandhi is widely admired not \nonly in India but around the world for his advocacy of nonviolent \nstruggle and the austere and celibate life he led when he was \nfighting for Indias freedom from the British.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing documents, letters and other research, Mr. Lelyveld writes \nabout how Gandhi came to his particular social vision, first as a \nlawyer in South Africa and later as a freedom fighter, and how he \ntried to spread that vision in India, with mixed results.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe controversy appears to have started because of reviews in \npublications in the United States and Britain, including one in The \nWall Street Journal, asserting that the book provides evidence that \nGandhi was a sexual weirdo, a political incompetent and a fanatical \nfaddist. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat review, by Andrew Roberts, a British historian, argued that \nGandhi was in love with Hermann Kallenbach, the German-Jewish \narchitect with whom Gandhi lived in Johannesburg, and it cited \nletters from Gandhi to Mr. Kallenbach, which are quoted in Great \nSoul. \u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi expresses great fondness and yearning for Mr. Kallenbach in \nthe letters, telling him that his was the only portrait on Gandhis \nmantelpiece, opposite the bed, and that cotton wool and Vaseline were \na constant reminder of him.\u0014",

    "words": "Black Preacher: Why I Forgave George Wallace\u0014\nBy jenee.desmondharris   Created 05/11/2011\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the wake of the tornadoes that ravaged Tuscaloosa, Ala., CNN's \nWayne Drash encountered an African-American preacher who explained \nwhy he was willing to grant the late Gov. George Wallace's appeal to \nthe black community for forgiveness for his racism-fueled insistence \non segregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church of the Rev. Kelvin Croom -- whose late father, the Rev. \nSylvester Croom Sr., has been recognized as one of the state's 40 \npioneers of civil rights -- sustained heavy damage from the tornados. \nHe told Drash that there's a connection between healing from the \nstorm damage and healing through forgiveness. Both, he said, are \npossible with hope for something better:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year was 1978. He was a senior at the University of Alabama. His \nfather approached him and said Wallace, then in his third term as \ngovernor, wanted to meet with them and other black leaders at the \nStafford Hotel:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rev. Kelvin Croom was with his father when Wallace asked for \nforgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young Croom paused. \"It caused me to really think.\" He thought \nabout the hate he'd seen on TV spewing from the governor's mouth. \"I \nsay segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,\" \nthe governor notoriously said as he was sworn into office in 1963.\u0014\n\u0014\nKelvin Croom decided to go with his father. \"And I'm glad I did,\" he \nsaid. The rumors in the black community, Croom says, had been that \nWallace was on a forgiveness tour to get the black vote.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Croom says he saw it differently in person.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He said he was wrong,\" Croom says. \"He asked for forgiveness. It was \nup to us to do that once he asked. It's just so amazing. He played \nthe great politics of the day - and by using hate and racial divide \nhe won.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet when they met privately that day at the hotel, Croom says, \"This \nman was really concerned for his soul and his relationship with Jesus \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n... Is there any message from that story that can be applied to those \naffected by the tornado destruction?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Even in the days we were living with segregation, we all had a hope \nfor a better day,\" Croom says. \"And right now, that's what we're \ndoing in Tuscaloosa: We're hoping for a better day, hoping we come \nfrom the ashes of destruction and into a beautiful, more livable \nAmerican city.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe adds, \"If a lot of us would forgive people, we could find healing. \nWe could find peace.\"\u0014",

    "words": "June 13, 1757 \u0014\n\u0014\nBenedict XIV Allowed Bible in Many Tongues\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nBy decree on this day June 13, 1757, Pope Benedict XIV said the \nnations could have the Bible in their own tongues. That this \nconcession should have been necessary is astonishing to Protestants, \nwho from the start encouraged putting the rich word of God into the \nhands of as many people as possible in their own languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this they were in line with the early church which had willingly \ntranslated the scriptures into local languages. Bede had rendered the \nGospel of John into Saxon. Alfred the Great translated, or had \nsomeone translate, 50 psalms. Charlemagne, after failing to force \nLatin on his people, accepted the Old French. All or parts of the \nBible were translated into several tongues. Cyril's Slavic version \nwas made with papal permission.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, during the later Middle Ages, authority was ascribed to \nJerome's Vulgate. Latin became the sacred language of the church. \nControl of Scripture was control of authority. Churchmen and rulers \nalike seemed to fear the impact of the scriptures on behavior, and \nthere is considerable evidence that both sought to keep it out of the \nhands of the common people. The official line of the church was that \nit feared abuse and profanation of the Word of God in the hands of \nlaymen since it was too deep even for the greatest scholars to \nunderstand.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn England, Wycliffe and his Lollard preachers were forbidden to \ndisseminate the word of God in English and Wycliffe's translations \nwere destroyed when the authorities found them. Church councils \nactually forbade translation into the vernacular. The council of \nOxford in 1408 condemned Wycliffe's version. By William Tyndale's day \ntranslation could be made only with the approval of a bishop. Because \nTyndale was unable to secure this necessary approval in England, he \nmoved to the continent, where he \"illegally\" translated the Bible \ninto his native tongue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Synod of Sens in 1528 forbade translating scripture into French. \nIn 1478 Pope Sixtus IV advocated censorship saying that women \nfoolishly \"arrogate to themselves the knowledge of scripture.\" Book \nburnings which included Bibles were common after 1521. Sometimes the \ntranslators and publishers themselves were burned. Possession of \nBibles became criminal and often resulted in the execution of the \naccused. There are cases on record of people cruelly executed by \norder of church authorities for the \"crime\" of teaching their \nchildren the Lord's Prayer or the Ten Commandments in their native \ntongue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1546 the Council of Trent allowed Bibles to be produced in the \nlocal languages as long as they had Catholic annotations and were \nattended by explanatory lectures. But in 1713 the papal \nbullUnigenitus condemned the proposition that the Bible was for \neveryone. In light of the Council of Trent, Benedict's decree could \nbe seen as a step backward. In light of Unigenitus it was a great \nstep forward, requiring only annotations and the approval of a bishop \nor of the Holy See. Benedict's humane spirit ensured that translators \nwere freed for their work. In Italy several versions appeared at once.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was by no means the end of the story. Even into the 1800s popes \nissued encyclicals against Bible societies and the dissemination of \nBibles in Catholic countries unless they included Catholic \nannotations. Today, however, Bible societies have worked out \nprotocols by which Protestants and Catholics pull together to make \njoint translations of scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Benedict XIV.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

    "words": "June 18, 1896 \u0014\n\u0014\nBernard Mizeki Took a Brave Stand\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Flee. Save your life!\" With words such as these, Bernard Mizeki was \nwarned that he had better leave Mashona. In 1896, Rhodesia's blacks \nwere in rebellion against their white conquerors. Although he was \nblack too, Bernard was in danger from fellow blacks because he taught \na foreign faith--the Gospel of Christ. And he had angered local \nwitchdoctors by cutting down some sacred trees. It did not matter to \nthem that he had the permission of supreme chief Mangwende. As far as \nthey were concerned, he had gained too much influence and they \nseethed with resentment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Bernard refused to run. He worked only for Jesus, he asserted, \nand could not leave the converts who lived on his mission station. \nThis bold reply won him a crown of martyrdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard was born sometime in the second half of the nineteenth \ncentury in Mozambique, which was then controlled by the Portuguese. \nHis parents named him Mamiyeli Mitseki Gwambe. He must have been \nplucky even as a boy, for he was not much older than twelve when he \nleft home for Capetown, South Africa to get work and an education. \nFor ten years, he lived in the slums, working by day and studying in \nthe evening. Appalled at the wretched, drunken lives around him, he \nfirmly refused alcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe school Mamiyeli Mitseki Gwambe attended was run by the Society of \nSt. John, an Anglican order. He became a Christian. On March 9, 1886, \nhe was baptized and took the name Bernard. He was about 25 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor five years he studied and worked as a layman church leader. He \nlearned about a dozen languages and helped translate Anglican texts \ninto African tongues. Bishop Knight-Bruce assigned Bernard to a post \nin Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Bernard threw himself wholeheartedly \ninto efforts to convert the villagers to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of his key endeavors was a school. By showing love to his pupils, \nhe won the hearts of their parents. Perhaps because he had seen \nfirst-hand the damage done by the clash of white culture with black, \nBernard adapted Christianity to the Mashona culture as much as he \ncould without watering down the gospel. This was possible in part \nbecause the Mashona already believed in just one god. In a short \ntime, he won many converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on Sunday, June 14, 1896, a witch-doctor convinced the Christian \nconverts to stay away from morning church service. They returned that \nevening. But time was running out for Bernard. On this day, June 18, \n1896 he heard a loud knocking at his door. His enemies had come for \nhim. They dragged him outside and drove a spear through his body.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard's wife and a helper bathed his wounds and went to fetch \nblankets for the dying man. From a distance they saw a blinding light \nand heard a rushing sound. When they returned, Bernard's body was \ngone. Had his killers returned and buried him among some nearby \nrocks? Or had angels carried him away? The site of his death has \nbecome a focus of Christian devotion and Africa's greatest Christian \nfeast is held each year near the date of his death. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGoss, Barbara. \"Bernard Mizeki.\" \nhttp://www14.brinkster.com/branchingout/ \nrhodesiantapestry/marandellas.html\u0014\nKiefer, James. \"Bernard Mizeki; Catechist and Martyr in Africa.\"\u0014\nLentz, Robert. \"Bernard Mizeki.\" \nhttp://www.bridgebuilding.com/narr/ebm.html\u0014",

    "words": "June 6, 1882 \u0014\nBlind Matheson Penned Immortal Hymn\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Matheson was hurting. It was not physical pain that cut him, \nor regret for the blindness that had robbed him of sight by the time \nhe was eighteen. Rather, it was anguish of spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was on this day, June 6, 1882, the day of his sister's marriage. \nHis family was staying overnight in Glasgow, Scotland, leaving him \nalone in the Manse (a parsonage). Something happened to forty-year \nold George as he sat alone there in the darkness of his blindness, \nsomething known only to himself, something which caused him severe \nmental suffering. He never confided to anyone what the problem was, \nand yet his heart cried out to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs his heart moaned, words welled up in his mind, words of comfort. \n\"I had the impression of having it dictated to me by some inward \nvoice rather than of working it out myself,\" he said later. He jotted \nthe lines down.\u0014\n\u0014\nO Love that wilt not let me go,\u0014\nI rest my weary soul in thee;\u0014\nI give thee back the life I owe,\u0014\nThat in thine ocean depths its flow\u0014\nMay richer, fuller be.\u0014\n\u0014\nO light that followest all my way,\u0014\nI yield my flickering torch to thee;\u0014\nMy heart restores its borrowed ray,\u0014\nThat in thy sunshine's blaze its day\u0014\nMay brighter, fairer be.\u0014\n\u0014\nO Joy that seekest me through pain,\u0014\nI cannot close my heart to thee;\u0014\nI climb the rainbow through the rain,\u0014\nAnd feel the promise is not vain,\u0014\nThat morn shall tearless be.\u0014\n\u0014\nO Cross that liftest up my head,\u0014\nI dare not ask to fly from thee;\u0014\nI lay in dust life's glory dead,\u0014\nAnd from the ground there blossoms red\u0014\nLife that shall endless be.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn less than five minutes, the poem was complete.

    "words": "June 25, 1115 \u0014\n\u0014\nBernard Founded Clairvaux\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Bernard joined a monastery, it was not one of the old, \nwell-established and rich abbeys, but Citeaux, of the newly-founded, \nreform-minded Cistercians. He brought with him thirty other recruits. \nWith that kind of zeal, it is not surprising that three years later \nhe was appointed abbot of his own monastery. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe monastery was as yet only in the mind. He and twelve followers \nset out to build it. On this day, June 25th, 1115, in an isolated \nvalley in Champagne, France, he founded the famed monastery of \nClairvaux. As was true of other Cistercians, he sought a return to \nthe strict rule of St. Benedict. Bernard disciplined himself so \nstrictly with fasts and hard work that his health was permanently \ndamaged. His followers had to appeal to him for a relaxation of the \nstern regimen, for they could not bear the austerities he demanded of \nhimself and of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite this, Clairvaux grew so rapidly that it soon founded sister \nmonasteries. Bernard himself founded 70. These in turn founded \nothers. Thanks to his zeal, the Cistercian order was among the \nfastest growing order of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis stirring sermons lent impetus to Cistercian growth. Catholics and \nProtestants alike have held his writings in high esteem. Protestants \nhave an especial regard for On Grace and Free Will, a carefully \nreasoned treatise on the perplexing subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard was spiritually minded. His teachings focus on love and \nholiness. They are saturated with allusions to scripture and, indeed, \nthe Cistercians gave prominence to God's word. Bernard also discussed \nthe role of the Holy Spirit. He argued vehemently against those, like \nAbelard, who would introduce a spirit of doubt into theology. He \nwanted God to be known and adored. Many spiritual hymns are \nattributed to him, for example:\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the very thought of thee,\u0014\nwith sweetness fills my breast;\u0014\nbut sweeter far thy face to see\u0014\nand in thy presence rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time Bernard was a practical and active man. Not only \ncould he cause monasteries to spring up where none had been before, \nbut he also took part in the affairs of his day. He preached in \nsupport of the Second Crusade. It failed. He threw all his influence \nbehind Innocent II against rival claimant Anacletus II. Thanks in \nlarge part to Bernard, Innocent II was acknowledged as true pope. \nBernard wrote the rule for the new order of the Knights Templars, \nsworn to defend the Holy Land. He sent hundreds of influential \nletters to the leaders of his era and made peace between a French \nking and his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what became of Clairvaux? After the French Revolution, its cells \nceased to house monks and housed prisoners instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux.

    "words": "Battling Over the Meaning of the Bible's Words \u0014\n\u0014\nJim Evans\u0014\nJuly 15, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nIn March, a group known as the Committee on Bible Translation \nreleased a new edition of the New International Version (NIV) of the \nBible. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first edition, released in 1984, has been one of the best-selling \ntranslations of the Bible in centuries  second only to the King \nJames Version from 1611. Endorsed by Billy Graham and other \nevangelical luminaries, the NIV has sold more than 400 million copies \nin the past 20 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut translators know that from time to time translations need to be \nupdated. Biblical scholarship helps us better understand the meaning \nof ancient words. And the English language (when that is the \u0014\n\u0014\nIn order for a biblical translation, or the translation of any \nancient text, to continue to be understandable, it must occasionally \nbe updated.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow for those who adhere to a theological view that the Bible is the \ninerrant and infallible word of God, these updates present a bit of a \nproblem. This has been particularly true for the Southern Baptist \nConvention.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir massive bookstore outlet, Lifeway Books, has for the time being \ndecided not to carry the updated NIV. They contend the new NIV has \nfundamentally changed the meaning of the biblical text  altering \nGod's Word to conform to cultural expectations.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, consider these words from John 14:23. The King James \nVersion reads: \"If a man loves me, he will keep my words: and my \nFather will love him, and will come unto him, and make our abode with \nhim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the world or inerrancy and infallibility, does this mean that only \nmen are subject to God's grace?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same verse in the 1984 edition of the NIV reads: \"If anyone loves \nme, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and will come \nto him and make our home with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStill sounds like only men get to have the blessing of God's presence.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is how the 2011 translation of the NIV handles this verse. \n\"Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, \nand we will come to them and make our home with them.\"\u0014\nBy changing \"him\" to \"them,\" some conservative Christians have \naccused the Committee on Bible Translation of altering the Word of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy suggesting that the Scriptures should be inclusive of both men and \nwomen, they claim the original meaning has been distorted.\u0014\n\u0014\nReally?\u0014\n\u0014\nSimply because an ancient translation in a male-dominated society \nused the word \"brethren,\" does that mean that women believers are not \nincluded in God's promises?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" there is a scene where \nAlice and Humpty-Dumpty have a conversation about words.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I use a word,\" Humpty-Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, \n\"it means just what I choose it to mean  neither more nor less.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The question is,\" said Alice, \"whether you can make words mean so \nmany different things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The question is,\" said Humpty-Dumpty, \"which is to be master  \nthat's all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is clearly the question for our time: which is to be master. Who \ngets to decide what the words mean? It makes a difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nWords are how we build our world and how we tear it down. Words make \nour laws and our lawlessness. Words form our blessings and our \ncursing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWords matter, but which is to be master? Who tells us what our words \nwill mean?\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L.

    "words": "Two Baptist sermons  one delivered three months before the war \nbegan, and the other delivered midway through the war  serve to \nillustrate the dedication and devotion of white Baptists in the south \nto white supremacy and black slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn January 27, 1861, before a standing room only audience Ebenezer W. \nWarren, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Macon, Georgia, \ndelivered a sermon entitled Scriptural Vindication of Slavery, here \npartially quoted:\u0014\n\u0014\nSlavery forms a vital element of the Divine Revelation to man. Its \ninstitution, regulation, and perpetuity, constitute a part of many of \nthe books of the Bible . The public mind needs enlightening from the \nsacred teachings of inspiration on this subject . We of the South \nhave been passive, hoping the storm would subside . Our passiveness \nhas been our sin. We have not come to the vindication of God and of \ntruth, as duty demanded . it is necessary for ministers of the \ngospel  to teach slavery from the pulpit, as it was taught by the \nholy men of old, who spake as moved by the holy Spirit . Both \nChristianity and Slavery are from heaven; both are blessings to \nhumanity; both are to be perpetuated to the end of time . Because \nSlavery is right; and because the condition of the slaves affords \nthem all those privileges which would prove substantial blessings to \nthem; and, too, because their Maker has decreed their bondage, and \nhas given them, as a race, capacities and aspirations suited alone to \nthis condition of life .\u0014\n\u0014\nOn August 21, 1863, Isaac Taylor Tichenor, arguably the most \ninfluential Baptist minister in Alabama and known as the fighting \nchaplain for his service in the Confederate Army, stood before the \nAlabama Legislature and delivered a Fast Day sermon (such days were \nperiodically called by government leaders North and South as a way of \ninvoking Gods blessing). The South was weary, Tichenor acknowledged, \nbut defending slavery and the Confederacy from the evil North was a \nholy task, and Gods hand remained upon his faithful people. Tichenor \ndeclared:\u0014\nTwo weary years of war have wrung this question from the agonized \nheart of our bleeding country. Oh! That we could have peace! \nexclaims the statesman, as he ponders the problems that demand \nsolution at his hands. Peace, sighs the soldier, as he wraps his \nblanket around him and lies down to sleep upon the open field. \nPeace! moans the widow, as she reads the fatal news of her heroic \nhusband fallen on some bloody field, and bitterly thinks of the \ndarkened future in store for herself and her orphaned children. The \nprayer of the land is for peace. You may hear it in the sanctuary, at \nthe fireside, around the family altar, in the silent chamber, on the \ntented field. When will it come? . If God governs the world, then \nhis hand is in this war in which we are engaged. It matters not that \nthe wickedness of man brought it upon us, that it was caused by the \nmad attempts of fanaticism to deprive us of our rights, overthrow our \ninstitutions, and impose upon us a yoke which, as freemen, we had \nresolved never to bear.(\\read the entire document)\u0014\n\u0014\nNever did it seemingly occur to Warren and Tichenor and most other \nwhite southern Baptists that God would want freedom extended to \nslaves. Whites were Gods chosen people, and blacks were destined to \nalways be enslaved to Gods chosen ones. Resistance to Gods plan for \nhumanity had led the North to start the war. Now at the very time \nthat black slavery was receding around the globe in the name of Gods \nlove for all people, Gods true will of racial subjugation on earth \nrested with the South. Freedom was the right of whites; slavery was \nthe lot of blacks. For the great cause of upholding Gods will for \nthe races, war  and the deaths of hundreds of thousands  was \nwarranted.\u0014\n\u0014\nDecades later, many white southerners, including Baptists, would deny \nthat slavery was the cause of the war. This denial remains widespread \ntoday among many white southerners of the twenty-first century. Yet \nthe record is clear. Slavery was the primary cause of the American \nCivil War.\u0014",

    "words": "Chaplain to the Confederacy: Basil Manly and Baptist Life in the Old \nSouth by James Fuller\u0014\n\u0014\n Historians have long argued about the causes of the Civil War. This \nbiography of Basil Manly, a neglected-but-important Southern Baptist \nminister and educator, illuminates our understanding of how the Civil \nWar was a culture war. Manly's long career as a preacher and \nuniversity president, his experiences as a father, husband, and \nslaveowner, all show the complexities of life in the Old South. \nFuller argues that Manly resolved the many tensions and problems in \nhis life through a steadfast reliance on Calvinist theology, \nespecially the doctrines regarding Christian duty. Duty as a \nChristian intertwined with the ethics of Southern honor, allowing \nManly to develop a sense of Christian gentility. Throughout his \ncareer, Manly worked hard to establish a distinctive Southern \nculture, including separate institutions. Thus he led the movement to \nform the Southern Baptist Convention in 1845, as well as helping to \nfound Southern schools like Furman University and the Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary. In 1861, Manly helped found the \nConfederate States of America, serving as official chaplain to the \nConfederate congress in Montgomery and delivering the prayer at the \ninauguration of Jefferson Davis as president of the new Southern \nnation that the Baptist viewed as the fulfillment of God's plan for \nhistory.\u0014",

    "title": "BATTLE FOR THE BIBLE TRANSLATION",
    "words": "Battle for the Bible Translation \u0014\n\u0014\nOur movement is wide enough to include a variety of methods. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Christianity Today Editorial | posted 9/02/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nAt their annual summer convention, the Southern Baptists passed a \nresolution expressing \"profound disappointment with Biblica and \nZondervan Publishing House\" for publishing the 2011 New International \nVersion, concluding that \"we cannot commend the 2011 NIV to Southern \nBaptists or the larger Christian community.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe resolution strikes us as divisive, shortsighted, and something \nthat brings us, and no doubt the majority of the Christian community, \nprofound disappointment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fair, the resolution was not brought to the convention by the \nresolution committee, which wisely determined that the convention did \nnot need to comment on the new translation. The resolution was the \nwork of a single delegate, and only one other person spoke on its \nbehalf. But no one on the convention floor spoke against it, and \neyewitnesses say that up to 90 percent of the delegates raised their \nballots to signal their approval.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue at stake is what the resolution called the NIV'S \n\"gender-neutral methods of translation,\" saying the 2011 NIV has \n\"gone beyond acceptable translation standards.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhose translations standards are they talking about? The translation \nprinciple the resolution refers to is properly called \"dynamic \nequivalence\" or \"functional equivalence.\" Such translations try to do \nsomething on the order of common sense: When arriving at a word or \nphrase that literally says one thing but functionally means another, \nthey choose the functional meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn biblical times, speakers would address a mixed group of believers \nwith the greeting \"brothers.\" Such was the practice even in English a \ngeneration ago. If a speaker were to do that today, many people in \nthe room would assume the speaker was addressing his remarks only to \nthe men present. If we translate the Greek word adelphoi as \n\"brothers\" in many biblical passages, it would lead the modern reader \nto the same conclusion. In short, it would mislead the reader. Hence, \nthe need for functional translations.\u0014\n\u0014\nFunctional equivalence is the principle used by the New Living \nTranslation, published by Tyndale. And by the New Century Version, \npublished by Thomas Nelson. We have no reason to believe that such \npublishing houses, or the reputable evangelical scholars who produced \ntheir versions, are driven by a secular feminist agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven so-called formal equivalence translationswhich do their best to \ntranslate the original languages word for word and syntactical \nstructure for syntactical structureregularly resort to functional \nequivalence. The English Standard Version, for example, always uses \nthe word man for the Greek anthropos when the context suggests a male \nhuman is in view. This is a literal and accurate translation in such \ncases. But when the context suggests that both men and women are in \nview, it uses people or others. This is a functional and accurate \ntranslation.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be clear, no contemporary, evangelically based translation changes \nthe gendered names used in God's self-revelation. The first person of \nthe Trinity is still called \"Father,\" and Jesus is his \"Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne SBC concern is ideology, a commitment to complementarianism, the \nview that men and women have different, divinely appointed roles in \nchurch and home. We all should be concerned about any translation \nthat lets an ideology shape its language. But we should not let \nideologyegalitarianism or complementarianismdetermine whether a \ntranslation is valuable or not. The only criterion for a good \ntranslation is this: Does it accurately convey what the authors said \nand what the original listeners heard?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo single translation method can possibly convey with complete \naccuracy the biblical text. An Italian proverb sums it up well: \nTraduttore traditore, \"The translator is a traitor.\" There is, \nindeed, always something lost in translation. So we need both formal \nand functional equivalence biblical translations. Formal equivalence \ntranslations highlight what the text literally said. Functional \nequivalent translations highlight how that text was originally heard. \nOnly when we employ these together can we begin to approximate \nScripture's deepest and broadest meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are convinced that the Southern Baptists want to grasp the deepest \nand broadest meaning of Scripture. Thus, we strongly encourage them \nto rethink the resolution and make room for a variety of translations.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently, variety has led to an increased investment in the Bible \namong Southern Baptists. LifeWay, the SBC's bookstore chain, recently \nreported that its Bible sales have doubled since 2005. The sales \ninclude tens of thousands of the NIV Study Bible, the Archaeological \nStudy Bible, the Quest Study Bible, and a host of other devotional \nand reference Biblesnot to mention the New Living Bible, the New \nCentury Bible, and their ancillary products. Such versions have \nhelped Southern Baptists and others grow in their faith in Jesus \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur advice: Don't do as the Southern Baptists say at their \nconventions. Do as they do in their bookstores.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2011 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "BLIND LOUIS BRAILLE GAVE READING TO THE BLIND",
    "words": "Blind Louis Braille Gave Reading to the Blind\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAt four o'clock in the morning on this day, January 4, 1809, in \nCoupvray, France, a local midwife eased tiny Louis Braille into the \nworld. Louis was the fourth child of his mother, Monique, and his \nfather Simon, a leather worker. The pair formed a sturdy middle-class \ncouple, devout and prosperous. But the boy appeared frail, so they \narranged to have him baptized right away.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis quickly showed himself to be a bright-eyed child, prying into \neverything. The early death that had been feared for him did not \nhappen. However, another disaster struck. Three-year-old Louis had \nbeen warned not to play with his father's tools. But temptation was \nstrong. One day, when no one was looking, he took up a sharp knife \nand tried to cut a piece of leather. The blade slipped, gouging one \nof his eyes. The wound became dangerously infected. Then the \ninfection spread to his good eye. Louis was blind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe town's old priest died. Father Jacques Palluy took his place. He \nsaw the potential of young Louis and began to teach him. Afterward, \nPalluy arranged for a newly appointed schoolmaster to instruct Louis. \nThe good priest later got Louis admitted to the Royal Institution for \nBlind Youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the institute, Louis proved to be an apt pupil. In addition to his \nregular subjects, he learned to play the piano. Playing religious \nmusic on the organ would become one of the joys of his later life.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain Barbier introduced a system of raised dots to the Royal \nInstitute. It had serious flaws. Young Louis was still just a boy, \nbut he set out to solve the problems of Barbier's system. The captain \nwas reluctant to accept suggestions from a boy, so Louis began to \nexperiment at night. At fifteen, he created the world's first really \ngood system for blind reading. At nineteen years of age, he developed \na Braille system of writing music. At twenty, he was a teacher at his \nown school.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn writing of his own system, Louis never sought glory, happy to \nremind his readers how much he owed to Captain Barbier. This, despite \nthe fact that Barbier fought Louis' system and tried to get his own \nmethod made the official medium of instruction. Louis showed true \nsaintliness. His frustration must have been great, because teachers, \nafraid of losing their jobs, also resisted the improved system.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeeply modest, Louis hid his many acts of kindness and charity. These \nwere often sacrificial. For instance, he gave up a position he loved, \nplaying organ for a church, simply because another blind person \nneeded it more than he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis developed tuberculosis in young manhood. As he lay dying he \nsaid, \"God was pleased to hold before my eyes the dazzling splendors \nof eternal hope. After that, doesn't it seem that nothing more could \nkeep me bound to the earth?\" He asked for final communion about \nmidday on January 6, 1852. After three and a half hours of agony late \nthat afternoon, he died at seven-thirty in the evening.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFeldman, Anthony. Scientists & Inventors.

    "words": "Black lives dont \nmatter.   Leonard Pitts\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a message that has, for centuries, been woven like thread into \nthe fabric of this nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was there when the Supreme Court said black people had no rights \nwhite people were bound to respect, there when Nazi POWs were seated \nat a Southern diner while black soldiers were sent to the kitchen, \nthere when federal researchers in Tuskegee experimented on unwitting \nblack men to find out what happens when syphilis goes untreated.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was there when Emmett Tills eye was gouged out and Sam Hoses \nface was skinned, there when the good people of Valdosta, Georgia, \ncarved Mary Turners baby from her womb and stomped it into the dirt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it is there in Fort Pierce, Florida, where a jury just decided a \nwrongful death suit against a St. Lucie County sheriffs deputy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deputy, Christopher Newman, was called to the home of the victim, \n30-year-old Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr. in January 2014 by a complaint \nthat he was playing his music loudly. Newman and his partner say that \nwhen they banged on the door of the garage, where the music was \ncoming from, Hill raised it, gun in hand  a contention his daughter, \nwho was across the street, denies, according to CNN. She says her \nfathers hands were empty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deputies claim they ordered him to drop the weapon, but he closed \nthe door instead. Newman fired through the door, striking Hill three \ntimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was found with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. Postmortem \ntoxicology tests indicate that he was drunk.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week, a federal jury found that Newman did not use excessive \nforce, but that his boss, Sheriff Ken Mascara, was slightly \nnegligent. It awarded Hills family $4 in damages. But it gets worse. \nReasoning that Hill bore 99 percent of the responsibility for his own \ndeath, the jury reduced that pittance by 99 percent, leaving his \nfamily just 4 cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the loss of your father, heres 4 cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the loss of your child, 4 cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the loss of your fiance, 4 cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor pain and suffering, for mourning and tears, as an expression of \nour corporate regret for this tragedy, 4 lousy cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe thing is, even if you buy Newmans tale, you are left with a man \nwho answered a loud knocking  while carrying a firearm in his own \nhome in a right-to-carry state  then closed the door. Apparently, \nthats a capital crime now, if youre black.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetter the jury had given his family nothing than to give them 4 \ncents. Yes, theyd have been disappointed, but that would have been \nbetter than this, a calculated insult on top of a fatal injury.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message this jury sends is an old one. It is as American as \nbaseball and apple pie, pine tar torches and burning flesh, as \nAmerican as that great lie about the truths we hold self-evident.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe familys attorney, John Phillips, heard it clearly. This says \nblack lives dont matter, he told CNN.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne thinks of how the conscientious parent of an African-American \nchild spends that childs lifetime refuting that message, trying to \nkeep it from finding purchase in a childs tender psyche. As white \nconservatives moan piteously about the racism they face, all but \nwhipping out a violin and playing Nobody knows de trouble Ive seen \nevery time the truth hurts their feelings, that parent is teaching \nhis child how to live through a traffic stop.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard work, trying to help a black child value himself in a \nnation where his worth is ever in question. Now theres this. You \ncant buy candy for 4 cents. You cant buy a stick of gum.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut a federal jury just bought Gregory Hills life.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeonard Pitts Jr. is a columnist for the Miami Herald\u0014",

    "words": "Benedict XIV \nAllowed Bible in Many Tongues\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nBy decree on this day June 13, 1757, Pope Benedict XIV said the \nnations could have the Bible in their own tongues. That this \nconcession should have been necessary is astonishing to Protestants, \nwho from the start encouraged putting the rich word of God into the \nhands of as many people as possible in their own languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this they were in line with the early church which had willingly \ntranslated the scriptures into local languages. Bede had rendered the \nGospel of John into Saxon. Alfred the Great translated, or had \nsomeone translate, 50 psalms. Charlemagne, after failing to force \nLatin on his people, accepted the Old French. All or parts of the \nBible were translated into several tongues. Cyril's Slavic version \nwas made with papal permission.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, during the later Middle Ages, authority was ascribed to \nJerome's Vulgate. Latin became the sacred language of the church. \nControl of Scripture was control of authority. Churchmen and rulers \nalike seemed to fear the impact of the scriptures on behavior, and \nthere is considerable evidence that both sought to keep it out of the \nhands of the common people. The official line of the church was that \nit feared abuse and profanation of the Word of God in the hands of \nlaymen since it was too deep even for the greatest scholars to \nunderstand.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn England, Wycliffe and his Lollard preachers were forbidden to \ndisseminate the word of God in English and Wycliffe's translations \nwere destroyed when the authorities found them. Church councils \nactually forbade translation into the vernacular. The council of \nOxford in 1408 condemned Wycliffe's version. By William Tyndale's day \ntranslation could be made only with the approval of a bishop. Because \nTyndale was unable to secure this necessary approval in England, he \nmoved to the continent, where he \"illegally\" translated the Bible \ninto his native tongue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Synod of Sens in 1528 forbade translating scripture into French. \nIn 1478 Pope Sixtus IV advocated censorship saying that women \nfoolishly \"arrogate to themselves the knowledge of scripture.\" Book \nburnings which included Bibles were common after 1521. Sometimes the \ntranslators and publishers themselves were burned. Possession of \nBibles became criminal and often resulted in the execution of the \naccused. There are cases on record of people cruelly executed by \norder of church authorities for the \"crime\" of teaching their \nchildren the Lord's Prayer or the Ten Commandments in their native \ntongue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1546 the Council of Trent allowed Bibles to be produced in the \nlocal languages as long as they had Catholic annotations and were \nattended by explanatory lectures. But in 1713 the papal bull \nUnigenitus condemned the proposition that the Bible was for everyone. \nIn light of the Council of Trent, Benedict's decree could be seen as \na step backward. In light of Unigenitus it was a great step forward, \nrequiring only annotations and the approval of a bishop or of the \nHoly See. Benedict's humane spirit ensured that translators were \nfreed for their work. In Italy several versions appeared at once.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was by no means the end of the story. Even into the 1800s popes \nissued encyclicals against Bible societies and the dissemination of \nBibles in Catholic countries unless they included Catholic \nannotations. Today, however, Bible societies have worked out \nprotocols by which Protestants and Catholics pull together to make \njoint translations of scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Benedict XIV.\" The \u0014\nOxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

    "title": "BUT HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS SPIRITUAL GOALS",
    "words": "Tierra! Tierra! The men had been on the sea for over thirty days \nwithout sight of land. Now land was in plain view. All the despair \nand gloom immediately gave way to excitement and hope as the three \nlittle ships drew closer and closer to the shore on this day, October \n12, 1492.\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably every American school child old enough to study history has \nheard the little rhyme, \"In October, 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean \nblue\", and the story has often been told of Columbus' dream of \nfinding the East or Asia by sailing west. Columbus is often held up \nas an example of someone who set goals for himself and would not give \nup when obstacles to achieving those goals came his way -- he waited \nat the Spanish court six years before King Ferdinand and Queen \nIsabella agreed to sponsor his voyage. He persuaded his men to \ncontinue their westward voyage even when they threatened mutiny \nbecause they had not yet reached the expected islands of the Orient. \nCertainly Columbus is a model of determination and courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, the man was much more complex than the stories often reveal. \nChristopher was a very devout Catholic who observed all the fasts of \nthe church and prayed regularly. His very name Christopher, which \nmeans Christ-bearer, he understood as a title of his destiny to carry \nthe message of the gospel to far-off lands. He diligently searched \nthe Scriptures and thought he found assurance for a call to sail to \nthe far reaches of the globe with the Christian message. Zechariah \n9:10 said that \"he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his \ndominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to \nthe ends of the earth. And Psalm 107:23-24 promised that \"They that \ngo down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These \nsee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher was particularly concerned with the power of the Ottoman \nTurks who controlled the eastern Mediterranean and were threatening \nEurope. If a way could be found of reaching India by sailing West, \nthe Turks could be attacked from behind and perhaps the Holy Land \nitself could be rescued from their hands. Yes, Columbus was \ninterested in trade and riches, but Christian concern also lay behind \nhis plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen land was sighted on this day October 12, 1492, in recognition of \nthe divine aid in his voyage, Columbus named the land San Salvador, \nwhich means Holy Savior, and prayed,\u0014\n\u0014\nO Lord, Almighty and everlasting God, by Thy holy Word Thou hast \ncreated the heaven, and the earth, and the sea; blessed and glorified \nbe Thy Name, and praised be Thy Majesty, which hath designed to use \nus, Thy humble servants, that Thy holy Names may be proclaimed in \nthis second part of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn keeping with the Christian motive underlying his mission, Columbus \nat first showed great concern for how the natives, whom he called \nIndians, were treated. He wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that they might be well-disposed towards us, for I knew that they \nwere a people to be delivered and converted to our holy faith rather \nby love than by force, I gave to some red caps and to others glass \nbeads, which they hung around their neck, and many other things...I \nbelieve that they would easily be made Christians, for it seemed to \nme that they had no religion of their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the same, Columbus' concern for the salvation of these people was \ncoupled with an attitude of superiority which saw nothing wrong in \nforcibly capturing the people and making them slaves of the \nEuropeans. And the missionary drive which was prominent during his \nfirst voyage, in later voyages became subordinate to his love of \nwealth and position. Unfortunately, Columbus was not the last to lose \nsight of his spiritual goals when tempted with wealth and power.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBandelier, Ad.

    "words": "Birthright citizenship: Can Trump eliminate it? \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Trump thinks he can change one of \u0014\nthe most fundamental parts of our Constitution \u0014\n\"with the stroke of a pen,\" said Garrett Epps in \u0014\nTheAtlantic.com. American citizenship has been \u0014\nthe birthright of everyone born in the United \u0014\nStates since the 14th Amendment was ratified in \u0014\nthe aftermath of the Civil War. But as part of his \u0014\nanti-immigrant crusade, President Trump is now \u0014\nthreatening to sign an executive order ending \u0014\nbirthright citizenship for anyone whose parents \u0014\nare not citizens. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn authoritarian order of that \u0014\nkind would leave millions of people born here in \u0014\nlegal limbo. The Constitution plainly states that \u0014\n\"all persons born or naturalized in the United \u0014\nStates, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" are \u0014\nAmerican citizens. Nevertheless, the idea \"has \u0014\ncrawled slowly from the fever swamps of the far \u0014\nright into the center of our discourse.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nActually, it's birthright citizenship that's unconsti- \u0014\ntutional, said Michael Anton in USA Today. The \u0014\n14th Amendment was written to guarantee citizen- \u0014\nship to freed black slaves and their descendants. \u0014\nIllegal immigrants and their children aren't \"subject \u0014\nto the jurisdiction\" of the United States as the for- \u0014\nmer slaves were. \"If the Framers simply intended to \u0014\nmake citizens of any person born in U.S. territory, \u0014\nthen that central clause has no purpose.\" Not true, \u0014\nsaid Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post. We \u0014\nknow from the historical debates at the time that \u0014\nthe 14th Amendment applied to everyone except \u0014\nchildren born to foreign diplomats and Native \u0014\nAmerican tribes, which were considered foreign \u0014\nnations at the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nOtherwise, everyone in the U.S. \u0014\nis subject to the jurisdiction of our laws, including \u0014\nillegal immigrants. \"Strengthen border security. \u0014\nBuild the wall. But leave the Constitution alone.\" \u0014\nTrump's argument may be radical, said Jamelle \u0014\nBouie in Slate. com, but \"he is the president\" and \u0014\n\"his words have weight.\" Just by putting birth- \u0014\nright citizenship on the table, Trump has embold- \u0014\nened some Republicans to echo him; a conserva- \u0014\ntive Supreme Court tilted by Trump appointees \u0014\nmight decide to revisit the issue. Even from a con- \u0014\nservative perspective, however, said Lyman Stone \u0014\nin TheFederalist.com, ending birthright citizenship \u0014\nwould be a mistake. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you think it's hard to \u0014\nassimilate immigrants now,\" imagine a permanent \u0014\nunderclass of millions of people born in America \u0014\nwith no legal rights, no allegiance to this country, \u0014\nand no country to return to. They'd resent and \u0014\ndespise the U.S. for turning them into stateless \u0014\nnonpersons. \"That's a recipe for disaster.\"\u0014",

    "title": "BLIND LOUIS BRAILLE GAVE READING TO THE BLIND",
    "words": "Blind Louis Braille Gave Reading to the Blind\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nAt four o'clock in the morning on this day, January 4, 1809, in \nCoupvray, France, a local midwife eased tiny Louis Braille into the \nworld. Louis was the fourth child of his mother, Monique, and his \nfather Simon, a leather worker. The pair formed a sturdy middle-class \ncouple, devout and prosperous. But the boy appeared frail, so they \narranged to have him baptized right away.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis quickly showed himself to be a bright-eyed child, prying into \neverything. The early death that had been feared for him did not \nhappen. However, another disaster struck. Three-year-old Louis had \nbeen warned not to play with his father's tools. But temptation was \nstrong. One day, when no one was looking, he took up a sharp knife \nand tried to cut a piece of leather. The blade slipped, gouging one \nof his eyes. The wound became dangerously infected. Then the \ninfection spread to his good eye. Louis was blind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe town's old priest died. Father Jacques Palluy took his place. He \nsaw the potential of young Louis and began to teach him. Afterward, \nPalluy arranged for a newly appointed schoolmaster to instruct Louis. \nThe good priest later got Louis admitted to the Royal Institution for \nBlind Youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the institute, Louis proved to be an apt pupil. In addition to his \nregular subjects, he learned to play the piano. Playing religious \nmusic on the organ would become one of the joys of his later life.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain Barbier introduced a system of raised dots to the Royal \nInstitute. It had serious flaws. Young Louis was still just a boy, \nbut he set out to solve the problems of Barbier's system. The captain \nwas reluctant to accept suggestions from a boy, so Louis began to \nexperiment at night. At fifteen, he created the world's first really \ngood system for blind reading. At nineteen years of age, he developed \na Braille system of writing music. At twenty, he was a teacher at his \nown school.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn writing of his own system, Louis never sought glory, happy to \nremind his readers how much he owed to Captain Barbier. This, despite \nthe fact that Barbier fought Louis' system and tried to get his own \nmethod made the official medium of instruction. Louis showed true \nsaintliness. His frustration must have been great, because teachers, \nafraid of losing their jobs, also resisted the improved system.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeeply modest, Louis hid his many acts of kindness and charity. These \nwere often sacrificial. For instance, he gave up a position he loved, \nplaying organ for a church, simply because another blind person \nneeded it more than he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis developed tuberculosis in young manhood. As he lay dying he \nsaid, \"God was pleased to hold before my eyes the dazzling splendors \nof eternal hope. After that, doesn't it seem that nothing more could \nkeep me bound to the earth?\" He asked for final communion about \nmidday on January 6, 1852. After three and a half hours of agony late \nthat afternoon, he died at seven-thirty in the evening.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFeldman, Anthony. Scientists & Inventors.

Living in Mansfield, Texas John has heard of \nthe terrible conditions and treatment that African Americans face \ndaily, but he is frustrated at how little he can understand in his \nown white skin. The truth will always be obscured to a white man, \nbecause white men dont want to acknowledge how poor the treatment of \nAfrican Americans is. So therefore, John decides to make the color of \nhis skin black. (1959) This decision will not only impact his own \nlife, but his familys life as well. His family is supportive of his \ndecision, and prepares for Johns absence. Along with this, a black \nmagazine named Sepia agreed to fund Johns experience. With the aid \nof medication, UV light, and skin paint, John undergoes the process \nof becoming black. Upon looking at himself in the mirror, John \ndoesnt even recognize himself.

    "words": "Birmingham Blast: Why Children?\u0014\n\u0014\n It was this day, Sunday, September 15, 1963. The place was 16th \nStreet Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. The lesson for the day \nwas, \"The Love that Forgives,\" based on Matthew 5:43, 44. \"You have \nheard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But \nI tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\" \nA prayer was to accompany the lesson: \"Dear God, we are sorry for the \ntimes we were unkind.\"\u0014\nThe lesson would prove to be grimly appropriate. But it was never \nfinished. At 9:22 A.M., before it could be completed, the church \nexploded.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen or fifteen sticks of dynamite planted under the back steps of the \nbuilding erupted with terrific force. The explosion hurled yellow \nbricks through cars, shattered nearby businesses and smashed a fist \nof terror through the church. The rest rooms at the rear of the \nchurch absorbed the brunt of the blast. Nonetheless, the shock was \nsufficient to collapse the church rafters, shred pews and shatter \nwindows. Members of this black congregation--wounded, bleeding, and \nblinded,--staggered into the street as rescue crews rushed to the \nscene. In place of hymns, screams and sobs and cries of protest \nfilled the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn angry mob of blacks gathered. Black ministers called on them to \npray for the men who had perpetrated this outrage. \"We must have love \nin our hearts for these men.\" But the anguish and bitterness of the \nmoment spoke louder. The mob began to pelt rescue workers and police \nwith stones as they dug into the rubble. Police fired over the head \nof the crowd to disperse them. Once again hatred prevailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBirmingham was no stranger to bombings. Since World War II, fifty had \nbeen directed against blacks. But none of the previous bombers had \nstruck against churches. Or targeted children.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, children were missing. Fears turned to stark reality as the \nwreckage was peeled aside from what had been the rest room. One man \nuncovered the remains of his own granddaughter. Torn and mangled \nbodies came to light: little bodies, the bodies of four girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley \ndied. Seventeen other people were wounded. The death toll could have \nbeen much higher. Four hundred people were in the church at the time. \nChrist could only have grieved. He taught us to love our neighbor as \nourselves, and yet the very churches built in his name were \nsegregated and subject to mindless violence as men battled for \npolitical control of a race-crazed city. One reporter noted that \nChrist's head in a stained glass window was blown off.\u0014\n\u0014\nKlansman Robert Chambliss was convicted of his part in the crime \nfourteen years after the blast. Two other conspirators, Tommy Blanton \nand Bobby Cherry were finally brought to justice in 2001 and 2002 \nrespectively.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nNews reports in Time, Newsweek and other news sources.\u0014\nSikora, Frank.

I ran around with church folks, I learned the God-talk, I \nsang the hymns, I even memorized the verses.  I prayed pretty good \nprayers, I carried my Bible to church Sunday after Sunday, I sang in \nthe choir, and I added to my schedule a Bible class every now and \nthen.  But my life was MY life.  I did not let all that religious \nstuff interfere with things like my career, my home, my strong will, \nmy pursuit of things, my determination to go my own way, or my own \npersonal plans.  I wasn't a wife beater, or a criminal, or an \nalcoholic, or some awful notorious sinner.  No, I was just a selfish \nman.  I knew how to get what I wanted, and nothing was going to stand \nin my way...including God.  I was a Christian, but certainly not a \ndisciple.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Then shortly after joining the Marines(another evidence of my \ndetermination to be tough and self-assured), I was transferred \noverseas. For once I was faced with a major decision I could not \nchange.  Alone and lonely, I was forced to entrust my wife to the \nLord, since she couldn't go to the Orient with me, and to lean on Him \nfor numerous things I had always been able to handle myself.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"While overseas I met a man who saw behind my tough mask and was \ndetermined to help me come to terms with the Christ I claimed as my \nSavior.  He discipled me.  Month after month, we met together, talked \ntogether, played ball together, laughed together, wept and prayed \ntogether, studied the Scriptures and witnessed for Christ together. \nLike Jesus with His men, this man took the time to help me peel off \nmy mask of religion and absorb the authentic message of Christ.  I \nfound myself slowly changing down deep inside.  I got to the place \nwhere I hated the hypocrisy of my former religious lifestyle.  I got \ninto the Scriptures on my own, and they became my bread and meat.  I \neven addressed the priorities, the goals, and the objectives of my \nlife.  I opened each door of my inner house to let Christ in, room \nafter room. Not suddenly, but slowly.  Quietly.  'Things' became less \nimportant to me.  My stubborn will came under the scrutinizing eye of \nthe Spirit of God.  And I began to meet each day with my Lord, asking \nHim to deal with my ugly selfishness...and did He ever!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Strengthening Your Grip by Charles Swindoll. Word, 1982.

    "words": "Clayton Lonetree was born in Chicago in 1961. His family was very \npatriotic with several of his ancestors having served in the Civil \nWar and in both world wars. Two of his uncles fought with distinction \nin Vietnam, and a third uncle, who fought in the Korean War, was \nawarded posthumously the Medal of Honor for heroism. Clayton grew up \nwanting to follow in their footsteps. His mother described him as \"a \ngood, obedient son, a law-abiding Baptist who knew the Bible and who \nnever got so much as a traffic ticket.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter high school, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and rose to the \nrank of sergeant. In 1985 he was assigned to the elite detail that \nguards the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. In November 1985, Lonetree began a \nlove affair with a beautiful Russian secretary who worked at the \nembassy. She introduced him to her \"uncle\" who was a KGB agent and \nslowly Lonetree was seduced into spying against his country. He \nturned over several classified documents to the KGB. Realizing his \nterrible actions, he alerted American authorities. In August 1987, he \nwas convicted of espionage and sentenced to thirty years in prison. \nEvil is never far away. It crouches near us waiting to take \nadvantage. Our only defense is to trust in the grace of God.\u0014",
