The \nRoman numerals at the base of the pyramid are a reminder of our \nnationa's birth date:1776.\u0014\n\u0014\n     On the right side of the bill:  The eagle became our national \nemblem in 1782, chosen as a symbol of strength and victory.

In one talon is an olive branch \nwith thirteen leaves, meaning peace; in the other talon is a bundle \nof thirteen arrows, symbolic of power and protection.

David was frightened \nthat he might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the \nfreezer door.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe parrot calmly stepped out onto David's extended arm and said: \n\"I'm sorry that I might have offended you with my language and \nactions, so I ask for your forgiveness.

    "title": "O'HARE AIRPORT NAMED AFTER HIM",
    "words": "During the course of World War II, many people gained\u0014\n fame in one way or another. One man was Butch O'Hare. He was\u0014\n a fighter pilot assigned to an aircraft carrier in the Pacific.\u0014\n One time his entire squadron was assigned to fly a particular\u0014\n  mission. After he was airborne, he looked at his fuel gauge\u0014\n and realized that someone had forgotten to top off his fuel\u0014\n tank. Because of this, he would not have enough fuel to\u0014\n complete his mission and get back to his ship. His flight\u0014\n leader told him to leave formation and return. As he was\u0014\n returning to the mother ship, he could see a squadron of\u0014\n Japanese Zeroes heading toward the fleet to attack. And\u0014\n with all the fighter planes gone, the fleet was almost\u0014\n defenseless.\u0014\n \u0014\n His was the only opportunity to distract and divert\u0014\n them. Single-handedly, he dove into the formation of Japanese\u0014\n planes and attacked them. The American fighter planes were\u0014\n rigged with cameras, so that as they flew and fought,\u0014\n pictures were taken so pilots could learn more about the terrain,\u0014\n enemy maneuvers, etc. Butch dove at them and shot until\u0014\n all his ammunition was gone, then he would dive and try\u0014\n to clip off a wing or tail or anything that would make the\u0014\n enemy planes unfit to fly. He did anything he could to keep\u0014\n them from reaching the American ships.\u0014\n Finally, the Japanese squadron took off in another\u0014\n direction, and Butch O'Hare and his fighter, both badly\u0014\n shot up, limped back to the carrier. He told his story,\u0014\n but not until the film from the camera on his plane was\u0014\n developed, did they realize the extent he really went to,\u0014\n to protect his fleet.\u0014\n He was recognized as a hero and given one of the nations\u0014\n highest military honors. And as you know, the O'Hare Airport\u0014\n was also named after him.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Part 2:\u0014\n Prior to this time in Chicago, there was a man named\u0014\n Easy Eddie. He was working for a man you've all heard about,\u0014\n Al Capone. Al Capone wasn't famous for anything heroic, but \u0014\nhe was notorious for the murders he'd committed and the \u0014\nillegal things he'd done. asy Eddie was Al Capone's lawyer\u0014\n and he was very good. In fact, because of his skill, he was \u0014\nable to keep Al Capone out of jail. To show his appreciation, Al \nCapone\u0014\n paid him very well. He not only earned big money, he would\u0014\n get extra things, like a residence that filled an entire\u0014\n Chicago City block. The house was fenced, and he had live-in help and\u0014\nall of the conveniences of the day. \u0014\n\u0014\nEasy Eddie had a son. He loved his son and gave him\u0014\n all the best things while he was growing up; clothes, cars,\u0014\n and a good education. And because he loved his son he tried\u0014\n to teach him right from wrong. But one thing he couldn't\u0014\n give his son was a good name, and a good example. Easy Eddie\u0014\n decided that this was much more important than all the riches\u0014\n he had given him. So, he went to the authorities in order\u0014\n to rectify the wrong he had done. In order to tell the truth,\u0014\n it meant he must testify against Al Capone, and he knew\u0014\n that Al Capone would do his best to have him killed.\u0014\n But he wanted most of all to try to be an example and\u0014\n to do the best he could to give back to his son, a good name. So he\u0014\n testified. Within the year, he was shot and killed on a\u0014\n lonely street in Chicago.\u0014\n \u0014\n  **This sounds like two unrelated stories, but Butch\u0014\n O'Hare was Easy Eddie's son.\u0014",

    "title": "ORPHANED SIBLINGS STRIVE TO HEAL",
    "words": "Orphaned siblings strive to heal \u0014\nBy Susan Gill Vardon Star-Telegram Staff Writer\u0014\n\u0014\nThe murder-suicide that left 14 Fort Worth children without parents \none November morning in 1967 was only the beginning of their pain. \nThree decades of anguish would follow as the Turnbow siblings \nstruggled to keep their family together. They would face two more \nviolent deaths before the survivors found hope and forgiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe siblings say they have drawn strength from one of their mother's \nlegacies -- her unwavering faith in God. Her gift has helped them to \nnurture their own families, to launch successful careers and, in \nseveral cases, to heal themselves by helping others. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarie Turnbow took her children to church every Sunday, unless her \nhusband forced them to stay home, said Valerie Henderson, 41, of \nRosemount, Minn. \u0014\n\"I think back now, as an adult, that she never abandoned her faith in \nGod, no matter how bad things were for her,\" Henderson said of her \nmother. \u0014\n \u0014\nThe siblings' faith was tested Nov. 8, 1967, when their father, Joel \nTurnbow, chased his former wife across the street from her house in \nthe Polytechnic area of Fort Worth. He shot her three times before \nturning the gun on himself. It was his final violent act after years \nof abusing his wife and children. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe family's faith was put to the test again years later, when two \nbrothers followed their father's lead -- each ending his life with \nthe blast of a gun. Gerald Turnbow, who was 17 when his parents died, \nkilled himself in 1979 in the front yard of his Fort Worth home. His \nyounger brother, Gary Turnbow, who lost his parents at age 11, shot \nhimself in 1989 in his home in Azle. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth were divorced and had battled depression and anger, said Michael \nTurnbow, 39, a landscaper in Richardson. Michael, who was 6 when his \nparents died, said he had pleaded with his brothers not to take their \nlives. When Gerald Turnbow called to say he was about to kill \nhimself, Michael Turnbow said, he begged him to reconsider. \u0014\n\"He said, `I'm going to give you my car,' \" Michael Turnbow recalled. \n\"I said, `I don't want your car. I want you.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time he got to his brother's house, Gerald Turnbow was dead. \u0014\nA decade later, Michael Turnbow received another call -- this time \nabout his brother Gary. He and brother Robert Turnbow rushed to \nGary's home, where he had locked himself in. \u0014\n\"Robert and I were both confident that we were going to talk our \nbrother out of shooting himself,\" Michael Turnbow said. \"But the one \nthing that we didn't realize was that he was not the same person that \nnight. He had been drinking and was determined to take his own life.\" \u0014\nCindy Kelley, the youngest sibling, said she worried about Michael \nand Robert for a long time. \u0014\n\"They were so devastated,\" she said. \"They would cry and cry.\" \u0014\nIn 1987, the siblings faced yet another loss. Their sister Nita \nWright died at 41 after giving birth to a son. \u0014\nNita had tried to get help for her mother the day she was killed, but \nthe telephone lines had been cut. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe siblings are mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, and \ngrandparents. There is a flight attendant, a substitute teacher, a \nminister, landscaper, a project analyst, an automotive body shop \nowner and a FedEx courier. After years of heartbreak, family members \nsay, they are stronger than ever. They have learned to trust that \nthose outside the family will not shun them if they learn the truth \nabout their father. That was not always the case. \u0014\n\u0014\nTina Justice, who was 5 when her parents died, said she used to tell \npeople that her parents were killed in a car accident.  \"I was \nashamed of what my daddy did, and I didn't want them to think I was \nthat type of person,\" said Justice, 37, of Newark, a project analyst \nfor Sabre. \u0014\nHer husband, Duane Justice, said his admiration and love for Tina \ngrew after she revealed her family history.  \"My heart went out to \nher because I had such a good relationship with my parents,\" he said. \n\"I stopped and thought what it would be like to lose my parents.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe siblings also strived to break the cycle of abuse and anger.  \nTheir successes are an indication of how far the Turnbow siblings \nhave come, family members said.  Terry Turnbow talks proudly about \nhis son, 20-year-old Cory, a champion bull rider and a fixture on the \nTexas rodeo circuit. Michael Turnbow said he believes that his \n12-year-old daughter, Stacie, will one day sing and dance on \nBroadway. Nita Wright's son, Mark Wright, is a state representative \nin Missouri. \u0014\n\u0014\nSandy Turnbow, 24, expresses an equal amount of pride when she \nrecalls her childhood with her father, Robert Turnbow, now 46 and \nliving in Hurst. \"Even though his dad was really hateful, my dad \nwould let me crawl in his lap and brush his hair for hours,\" said \nSandy Turnbow, 24, of Watauga, a flight attendant for American Eagle. \n\"He was very patient and gentle,\" she said. \"That's what amazed me \nwhen I got older. I realized, `Wow, they have come so far.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\nCindy Kelley's daughter, Amanda, said her family experiences have \nbeen positive. \"I think we have a really neat family,\" said Amanda, \n15. \"When we get together, we have the best time. Everybody has a \ngreat sense of humor.\" But Cindy Kelley is taking no chances. She has \ndecorated her house with every kind of lighthouse -- from figurines \nto paintings -- as a way to reassure her children that they are \nprotected. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I want to reflect to my kids that when you're in the darkest time of \nyour life, there is always a light somewhere,\" she said. Now, 11 \nyears after Gary Turnbow killed himself, the siblings say the bad \ndays are over. \"I know without a doubt that no one else is going to \ncommit suicide,\" Cindy Kelley said. \"We have overcome that. This is a \ngroup of overcomers here.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFor sisters Cindy Kelley and Valerie Henderson, helping others is a \nkey to healing. \u0014\nKelley teaches suspended students at Fossil Ridge High School. \nProminently displayed in her classroom is a poster that challenges \nstudents to \"Choose to love or hate\" or \"Choose to build or destroy.\" \nThose are decisions that she was forced to make early in life, Kelley \ntells her students.  \"I always talk to them about how hate changed my \nlife because of what my father did, and how forgiveness has now \nchanged our lives,\" she said. \"Now we can be loving. We don't have to \nlive in the past of what our father did. We can move on.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nKelley said she believes that by being honest and open about her \npast, she gives her students the courage to share their problems -- \nwhether it is drug and alcohol use or an abusive parent. She said it \nhelped her to develop a relationship with 17- year-old Fossil Ridge \njunior Brandi Eastwood, who was having difficultly dealing with the \ndeath of her 19-year-old sister last year. Eastwood's sister died in \nan accident caused by a drunken driver. \"It felt good to know there \nwas someone with a story like mine, and that she had lost someone she \nloved dearly and has been going through the same thing I will be \ngoing through for a long time,\" Eastwood said. \u0014\n\u0014\nEastwood, in turn, told her story to students in Kelley's class and \nlearned that other students had similar experiences. Now the students \nare talking about forming a group to talk to others about drugs, \nalcohol and other topics. \u0014\n\"I think that's pretty awesome,\" Kelley said. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor Henderson, forgiving her father led her to create Road Block \nMinistries. \u0014\nHenderson, who still has the Bible given to her by members of the \nPoly Baptist Church in 1967 after her parents' deaths, said she hopes \nto take her ministry of forgiveness to the Polytechnic area, to erase \nthe stain left by her father's violent acts. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe visited her old neighborhood last summer, she said, and was \ndismayed after seeing boarded-up houses and churches. \"I've thought \nabout it many times -- to really go into the neighborhood and ask \nthem what would help their community and make it the strong \nneighborhood it used to be,\" Henderson said. \"I would like to take \nthe negative and turn it to a positive in that area.\" Healing has \nbeen a little more difficult for the older brothers and sisters, who \nwitnessed and suffered the most abuse, Kelley said. \u0014\n\u0014\nPlezz Turnbow, who was 24 when his parents died and who became the \nchildren's guardian, was silent for years about his family history. \nBut four years ago, he made peace with his past during a family \nEaster party. Plezz Turnbow, a minister who lives in Quinlan, east of \nthe Metroplex, told stunned family members that he had always blamed \nhimself for his parents' deaths, Kelley said. \"He started crying and \ntold us he had seen our daddy abusing our mother so much that he was \ntired of it,\" she recalled. \"He had told our dad, `If you ever lay \nanother hand on our mother, you better go ahead and kill yourself. \nBecause if I get ahold of you, you will wish that you did.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\nTogetherness has been the most powerful force for healing, the \nsiblings say, including the annual Easter and Christmas parties, the \nweddings, the high school graduations, the taco feasts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"As the years have gone by, it's amazing to me how we've gotten \ncloser together,\" Michael Turnbow said. \"My best friends are my \nbrothers and sisters.\"\u0014",

He was completely captivated by her deep \ncompassion for the poorest of the poor in Calcutta's slums. But he, \nan unbeliever, could not accept her faith. What especially kept him \nback was that he could not join the church, such an imperfect and \nflawed institution. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnce, while Mother Teresa visited London, she and Muggeridge took a \nwalk, and Muggeridge reports, \"I took up my well-prepared defensive \nposition about the church, whose deficiencies, crumbling barricades, \nand woeful future prospects, I expatiated upon, with little effect.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter she left London, she wrote Muggeridge a letter and enclosed a \nsmall devotional book. Here are excerpts from her letter, which are a \nmodel of how to share your faith lovingly: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think I understand you better now. I don't know why, but you to me \nare like Nicodemus, and I'm sure the answer is the same: 'Unless you \nbecome a little child.' I'm sure you will understand beautifully \neverything if you would only become a little child in God's hands. \nYour longing for God is so deep, and yet he keeps himself away from \nyou. He must be forcing himself to do so, because he loves you so \nmuch, as to give Jesus to die for you and for me. Christ is longing \nto be your food. Surrounded with fullness of living food, you allow \nyourself to starve. The personal love Christ has for you is infinite. \nThe small difficulty you have regarding his church is finite. \nOvercome the finite with the infinite. Christ has created you because \nhe wanted you. I know what you feel, terrible longing with dark \nemptiness, and yet he is the one in love with you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nApparently Mother Teresa's love kept working on Muggeridge. Just 8 \nyears before he died (in 1990), he finally overcame his objections \nand publicly joined the Christian church. \u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Kevin A. Miller, author, Wheaton, Illinois\u0014",

NASCAR is left to continue without the boundless \ncharm,\u0014\n                     swagger and charisma possessed by a driver who \ndrew the rapt attention of millions whenever he strapped into his No. \n3\u0014\n                     Chevrolet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When the seven-time Winston Cup champion died in \na Turn 4 crash on the final lap of the Daytona 500 on Sunday, a large \npart\u0014\n                     of NASCAR perished with him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"This is a terrible, terrible loss,\" Lowe's \nMotor Speedway President Humpy Wheeler said. \"For me, it ranks right \nup there with the\u0014\n                     death of JFK. Dale was the Michael Jordan of our \nsport.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"We will never fill the void left by the loss of \nDale Earnhardt.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     As Jordan captivated the country with the flick \nof his wrist, so did Earnhardt with a flick of the steering wheel. \nBoth athletes\u0014\n                     transcended the sports they dominated, drawing \nlegions of new fans worldwide.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"If there was an autograph session, and it was \nDale Earnhardt against anybody else in the garage area, he would \noutdraw them\u0014\n                     two or three to one,\" Jimmy Spencer said. \"Why? \nBecause they want to meet John Wayne. He could probably outdraw any\u0014\n                     professional athlete in the world and maybe even \nthe president of the United States. He had that kind of power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Earnhardt appeared in movies and on cereal \nboxes. As NASCAR grew in the 1990s from a regional stock-car circuit \ninto a major\u0014\n                     U.S. sport with network television coverage, \nEarnhardt grew from a Southern folk hero into a staple of American \npop culture.\u0014\n                     With as many fans as any driver in NASCAR \nhistory, Earnhardt reaped millions annually from the sale of \nmemorabilia bearing\u0014\n                     his name.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"It's hard to put into words what the loss of \nDale Earnhardt means,\" Martinsville Speedway President Clay Campbell \nsaid. \"At a\u0014\n                     time when the popularity of NASCAR has been \nrapidly growing across this country, we can thank Dale Earnhardt for \na lot of that\u0014\n                     attention. The fan base he enjoyed is \nunparalleled in this sport.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Earnhardt would have turned 50 on April 29, and \nhe had talked of driving for at least a few more seasons before \nretiring. He had\u0014\n                     planned to follow the lead of Richard Petty in \nbecoming a visible elder spokesman.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But his death left Earnhardt's shaken colleagues \npondering the future of their sport without its biggest superstar. \nThe NBA has\u0014\n                     struggled with sagging popularity and TV ratings \nsince Jordan's retirement before the 1999 season.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"There isn't one person in NASCAR that won't say \nthey'll miss him,\" Spencer said. \"I was talking to my dad today, and \nI said,\u0014\n                     'What are we gonna do as drivers?' We all \ncongregated around him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Said Johnny Benson: \"NASCAR lost its greatest \ndriver and probably the greatest driver it will ever have. Our sport \nwill go on, but\u0014\n                     I don't think it will ever be the same. NASCAR \nis about family, and I can't think of a time in its history when it \nneeds to pull\u0014\n                     together like a family.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In its 52-year history, NASCAR had had to close \nranks often to deal with death. Last year, stock-car racing's major \nleagues moved\u0014\n                     on after grieving for Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin \nand Tony Roper.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In 1993, NASCAR withstood the deaths of Alan \nKulwicki and Davey Allison. In 1964, the series showed its resiliency \nafter\u0014\n                     defending champion Joe Weatherly and Fireball \nRoberts died after accidents a few months apart.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     None of those drivers made as big an impact on \nNASCAR as Earnhardt. But NASCAR Chairman Bill France Jr. called \nWeatherly\u0014\n                     and Roberts \"Dale Earnhardts of their era.\" As \nthe sport survived then, so will it now without Earnhardt, France \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"It's going to take time if we ever fill the \nvoid,\" France said. \"I'm sure we will. Life has to go on. Someone's \ngoing to come along.\u0014\n                     . . . Dale Jr. looks like he's got pretty good \npotential to follow in his father's footsteps.\"\u0014",

The documents\u0014\n                 show Noel represented himself as co-owner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The couple surrendered to authorities Tuesday at a \nhouse in Corning, about 170\u0014\n                 miles northeast of San Francisco. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Gruesome Attack\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The fatal attack on Diane Whipple, 33, occurred on \nJan. 26, in the hallway of the San\u0014\n                 Francisco apartment building that was home to \nWhipple and to Noel and Knoller.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The couple acquired the 120-pound presa Canario dog \ninvolved in the attack, Bane,\u0014\n                 and a female of the same breed, Hera, from a woman \nwho was raising them for two\u0014\n                 Pelican Bay State Prison inmates  clients of Noel \nand Knoller. The inmates\u0014\n                 reportedly wanted to breed the dogs and sell puppies \nas guard dogs for illegal drug\u0014\n                 labs or to be used in dog fights.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Part of our investigation focused on whether or not \nthere was such training [to attack\u0014\n                 people],\" Hammer said. \"The other part of the \ninvestigation we conducted involved\u0014\n                 whether or not there were prior incidents of \nviolence by these dogs that would have\u0014\n                 given the owners notice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Bane ripped through Whipple's throat, while Hera \ntore at her clothes, authorities say.\u0014\n                 Whipple, a College of California lacrosse coach, \ndied of her injuries.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The indictments Tuesday rounded out a bizarre day \nfor the couple.

Just what are the tenets of this thinking? And \ndid they figure in last year's election returns? \u0014\n\u0014\nLike other political movements before it, the radical right in \nAmerica today has its extremist component, which plainly was a force \nin the 1994 elections. For instance, George Nethercutt, the \ngiant-slayer Congressman who knocked off former House Speaker Tom \nFoley in Washington State, drew strength from radio shows where \ncallers talked about sightings of black helicopters and U.N. plans to \nset up a secret compound in the state. In neighboring Idaho, Helen \nChenoweth upended an environmentalist Democratic incumbent in part by \nsaying that the only endangered species was the \"white Anglo-Saxon \nmale.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThese politicians and others drew on widespread mistrust and even \nhatred of government power in Western and rural areas. Their \ncoalition included well-known elements of far-right thought: tax \nprotesters; Christian home-schoolers; conspiracy theorists influenced \nby the John Birch Society's fear of one-world government; Second \nAmendment activists\u0014\n(mostly men) for whom guns are an important part of an independent \nway of life; self-reliant types who resent a Federal Government that \nseems to favor grizzly bears and wolves over humans on government \nland. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this is common stuff in many parts of the country. It is several \ngiant steps from this movement to the extremist-fringe thinking that \nseems to have bred the Oklahoma City bombing. That frame of mind \nappeals to a hard-bitten and alienated segment of society that has \nfound a voice lately in millennial movements like the Christian \nPatriots and the state \"militias,\" largely in the Middle West and \nWest. The militias may be - as they strongly claim to be - composed \nlargely of yeoman states'-righters energized over the threat to the \nSecond Amendment. But they have also fostered viciously \nantigovernment thinking that if followed to its logical end leads in \none direction: armed uprising. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most belligerent militia is the Militia of Montana, with \nheadquarters in the Cabinet Mountains near Noxon. \"This is probably \nwhere the war is going to begin, right here in Montana,\" a member who \nrefused to be identified told the bbc last year. \"We've got a lot \nmore bullets than they do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Trochmann, the militia's cofounder, distributes literature that \nwould terrify many people. It features photographs of\u0014\nSoviet jeeps said to be on American soil. Russian troops are going to \narrive here as part of an international police force,\u0014\ncontends Trochmann's newsletter, Taking Aim. Our own government, the \nliterature asserts, is guilty of \"treason,\" is\u0014\nsecretly building concentration camps and is planning nine zones to \nreplace the lower 48 states - a partition plan that\u0014\nthe Militia of Montana asserts was spelled out in an illustration on \nthe back of Kix cereal boxes last year. Martial law is\u0014\ninevitable. And Trochmann endorses the prediction that sometime in \nthe next century, \"America's white population will\u0014\nperish.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHis newsletter issues a call to action: \"We must all become \n'Political Dogs' getting in the trenches and fighting like we\u0014\nhave never fought before. While at the same time preparing ourselves, \nour families ... ((to)) understand the times that we\u0014\nnow live in. In other words, GET YOUR THREE B's ((boots, beans and \nbullets)) PUT AWAY.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother strand in the alienated right is known as constitutionalism, \na belief that the government has violated the\u0014\nConstitution. These arguments are generally not as aggressive as \nTrochmann's, but adherents all but renounce their\u0014\ncitizenship. Stewart Balint is a handsome, blue-eyed construction \nworker in Priest River, Idaho, whose family lost its\u0014\nfarm to bankers. He told me his studies of law had led him to the \nunderstanding that government powers are not legally\u0014\nderived. \"I've gotten rid of all my contracts with government,\" he \nsaid. \"Rescinded them. Social Security, birth certificate.\u0014\nDriving license, hunting license. I know the law, and it's not a \nlosing battle for me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBalint wears a belt buckle with an image of the Apache chief Cochise. \nHe emulates the spirit of the Indians,\u0014\ndisenfranchised on their ancestral territories. He seems to see \nhimself and his friends as migrant workers in a\u0014\nwonderland visited by wealthy fly-fishing enthusiasts from the \ncoasts. For some of these radicals the Endangered\u0014\nSpecies Act disguises a plan to create concentration camps for those \nwho resist the new world order. \u0014\n\u0014\nLastly, there is a religious component to the hard-bitten right. Dan \nFuller, a retired crop duster who last year joined a\u0014\n\"Christian covenant community\" in Idaho, glimpses signs of the \"mark \nof the beast\" from Revelations in government\u0014\nfiscal policy. He shares a widespread fear among Christian patriots \nthat bodily implanted microchips will replace cash,\u0014\nultimately spelling slavery for ordinary Americans. Vicki and Randall \nWeaver had visions of an apocalypse brought on by\u0014\na Babylonian Federal Government, or zog (Zionist-Occupied \nGovernment). The apocalypse that came to their Idaho\u0014\nmountaintop in 1992 - over flimsy gun charges against Randall - is \none the Weavers surely helped bring on. But when\u0014\nan fbi sharpshooter killed Vicki Weaver as she held her baby in her \narms, it gave the movement a martyr. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Weavers apparently believed that after the great tribulation a \nremnant of the righteous would survive to work for a\u0014\nnew kingdom over the resistance of the sheep people, or \"sheeple.\" \nThe Militia of Montana offers a similar vision: those\u0014\nwho will rescue the Constitution are an underground army of men who \nhave semiautomatics cached in barrels in the\u0014\nwoods and who know you can catch catfish with Ivory soap as bait, men \nwhom society now views as \"outcast,\"\u0014\n\"strange\" or \"erratic primitives\" (in highlighted descriptions from \nclippings in Trochmann's mailings). \u0014\n\u0014\nThere aren't many adherents of these ideas. Experts suggest they \nnumber somewhere in the low tens of thousands.\u0014\nBut with the right ingredients of paranoia and store-bought \nchemicals, it takes only a few to make the most bizarre\u0014\nworld view come true for a blazing moment. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 1995 Time Inc.

In July, at his villa in \nSt.-Tropez, the Egyptian tycoon\u0014\n                 personally set in motion a romance between the \nPrincess of Wales and his\u0014\n                 eldest son Dodi by plucking him off one family yacht \nto join his father on\u0014\n                 another one nearby, where Diana was tanning. As the \nromance blossomed\u0014\n                 into the possibility of an engagement, al Fayed \nfeigned nonchalance.\u0014\n                 \"Normal people fall in love,\" he told an \ninterviewer. \"That's it.\" But al Fayed\u0014\n                 surely exulted inside. His battles with the British \nestablishment--over his\u0014\n                 1985 purchase of Harrods, his unrewarded quest for \ncitizenship, his hand in\u0014\n                 bringing down Tory ministers--had left him \nembittered. In Diana he picked\u0014\n                 up the jewel both prized and tossed aside by the \nEnglish elite, a diamond\u0014\n                 with an edge that could cut. Snaring her, and \nperhaps even installing her in\u0014\n                 the former residence of the Duke and Duchess of \nWindsor (which al Fayed\u0014\n                 holds), would simultaneously concoct an alternative \nmonarchy and remind\u0014\n                 the real one of a time when it had faltered. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But al Fayed's world collapsed that Sunday morning \nin Paris, when\u0014\n                 he lost the son he loved and the princess he sought, \nand, too, the\u0014\n                 chance for acceptance from the country he adopted. \nFrom the start\u0014\n                 of the fated relationship, the force that pulled \nDiana toward the\u0014\n                 Fayeds was powerful: beyond sharing their sense of \nrejection, the\u0014\n                 princess undoubtedly craved the cocoon made possible \nby Dodi's\u0014\n                 family planes and mini-palaces, as well as the \nglamour of his Ritzy\u0014\n                 life. And after years in a family repelled by \nemotion, here was a family\u0014\n                 driven by it, whether in its public vendettas or in \nits private\u0014\n                 Mediterranean moments. To embrace all this, Diana, \nhaving left one\u0014\n                 dynasty that had used her, was ready to enter \nanother. The Fayeds\u0014\n                 and she would find redemption together. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The union of Diana and Dodi would have culminated \nthree decades\u0014\n                 of exhaustive and expensive attempts by the sixtyish \nMohammed al\u0014\n                 Fayed to prove his British bona fides by collecting \nsome of the\u0014\n                 nation's trophies. In addition to Harrods, he owns \nthe famed humor\u0014\n                 magazine Punch, the Fulham Football Club and \nBalnagow castle in\u0014\n                 Scotland; his millions have sponsored the annual \nRoyal Windsor\u0014\n                 Horse Show, where he has shared the royal box with \nthe Queen. Al\u0014\n                 Fayed's younger brother Ali owns Turnbull & Asser, \nthe prestigious\u0014\n                 tailor used by Prince Charles and his sons William \nand Harry. And al\u0014\n                 Fayed has long courted Diana and her parents; he put \nher\u0014\n                 stepmother Raine on the board of Harrods. Diana's \nfather Earl\u0014\n                 Spencer, while dying, reportedly told al Fayed to \n\"keep an eye\" on\u0014\n                 the family. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Despite these ingratiating efforts, and his \nconsiderable commitments\u0014\n                 to various charities, acceptance within the British \nelite has eluded al\u0014\n                 Fayed. In France his restoration of two fabled Paris \nproperties, the\u0014\n                 Ritz Hotel and the Bois de Boulogne villa of the \nDuke and Duchess of\u0014\n                 Windsor, earned him La Legion d'Honneur. But in \nBritain al Fayed\u0014\n                 could recite--and often did--a list of the many \nslights directed at him\u0014\n                 by the Establishment. After he poured $50 million \ninto restoring the\u0014\n                 Windsor villa, he grumbled to the New York Times, \n\"Not one single\u0014\n                 official said, 'Mohammed al Fayed, thank you. We are \ngrateful.' Not\u0014\n                 one single letter.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 From the start, al Fayed has portrayed himself as \nthe victim of\u0014\n                 English arrogance, xenophobia and racism. Elites, he \ncontends,\u0014\n                 resent him for owning Harrods. \"It sticks in their \nthroats,\" he told the\u0014\n                 Times. But the Fayeds have also inflicted much \ndamage on\u0014\n                 themselves, starting with their unsuccessful \nattempts to rewrite their\u0014\n                 history. In 1985 the largely unknown Fayed brothers \npaid $689\u0014\n                 million in cash for the House of Fraser retail chain \n(whose flagship\u0014\n                 was Harrods). Two years later, the Department of \nTrade and\u0014\n                 Industry--at the instigation of al Fayed's chief \nrival for control of\u0014\n                 Harrods--began investigating the family. Its report, \npublished in 1990,\u0014\n                 concluded that the brothers did not hail, as they \nhad claimed, from\u0014\n                 \"an old Egyptian family\" with a 100-year history of \nlandownership and\u0014\n                 shipbuilding. \"The image created...of their wealthy \nEgyptian ancestry\u0014\n                 was completely bogus,\" the report said. The \ngovernment further\u0014\n                 concluded that the money al Fayed used to purchase \nHarrods could\u0014\n                 not have come from an inherited fortune, as he \nclaimed, but was\u0014\n                 probably put up for al Fayed by his associate, the \nSultan of Brunei,\u0014\n                 the world's wealthiest man. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Al Fayed was not accused of breaking any law, and he \nand the\u0014\n                 Sultan denied the charges. Al Fayed bitterly \nattacked the report as a\u0014\n                 smear. \"They could not accept that an Egyptian could \nown Harrods,\u0014\n                 so they threw mud at me,\" he once said. But \nacquaintances of his in\u0014\n                 Alexandria also describe the Fayeds as a modest \nfamily: al Fayed's\u0014\n                 father was a language teacher, and al Fayed grew up \non the rougher\u0014\n                 side of town. He started as a small-time trader \nthere, selling Singer\u0014\n                 sewing machines and Coca-Cola. In the early 1950s \nthe future Saudi\u0014\n                 billionaire Adnan Khashoggi offered al Fayed a share \nin a Khashoggi\u0014\n                 business that exported Egyptian-made furniture to \nSaudi Arabia. The\u0014\n                 company took off, and not long after, al Fayed \nmarried Khashoggi's\u0014\n                 sister Samira, who gave birth to Dodi in 1955. He \ndivorced her after\u0014\n                 two years and went into the construction business in \nthe United Arab\u0014\n                 Emirates. After befriending Dubai's ruler, al Fayed \nwon big\u0014\n                 development contracts for British firms prowling the \nPersian Gulf. \"Of\u0014\n                 course,\" says Khashoggi, \"there were fees and \ncommissions.\" This\u0014\n                 brokering was the foundation of the Fayed family \nfortune. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But even as he grew richer, al Fayed could not \nachieve his most\u0014\n                 cherished goal: to become a British citizen. The \nFayed brothers'\u0014\n                 applications for citizenship stalled in the early \n'90s following the\u0014\n                 release of the report. It did not matter that they \nhad paid millions of\u0014\n                 pounds in taxes annually, or that all four of al \nFayed's children by his\u0014\n                 second wife are British. So al Fayed struck back in \n1994 and\u0014\n                 revealed to the Guardian that for more than two \nyears he had\u0014\n                 supplied Tory Members of Parliament with cash and \nfree stays at the\u0014\n                 Ritz Hotel in exchange for political favors. Only \nafterward did the\u0014\n                 government officially turn down the brothers' \ncitizenship request,\u0014\n                 without explanation--a decision al Fayed is \nappealing. The scandal,\u0014\n                 meanwhile, brought down two M.P.s and fueled a \npublic outcry that\u0014\n                 contributed to the Conservatives' defeat in last \nspring's general\u0014\n                 election. Al Fayed seized the high ground, declaring \nhe was \"sick\u0014\n                 and tired of the hypocrisy that goes on at the \nhighest level of\u0014\n                 government.\" But he failed to see that his \nrevelations had brought to\u0014\n                 light his own culpability as a briber and that he \nwould draw further\u0014\n                 resentment from Britain's power circles. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Al Fayed's public persona, all bluster, defiance and \neccentricity, has\u0014\n                 done little to burnish his image. He is reportedly \nobsessive about\u0014\n                 personal security, employing a large number of \nbodyguards. He is\u0014\n                 litigious, and his dismissal of scores of Harrods' \nemployees also\u0014\n                 invited litigation against him. And despite the \nriches he flaunts--a\u0014\n                 fleet of 64 Rolls-Royces, properties on London's \nPark Lane, a $32\u0014\n                 million yacht--his record as an entrepreneur is very \nmixed. Last year\u0014\n                 the board of the weekly Observer rebuffed al Fayed's \nattempts to\u0014\n                 buy the paper, saying it was not for sale. In 1995 \nRupert Murdoch\u0014\n                 shut down his Today newspaper rather than sell it to \nal Fayed. Bids\u0014\n                 to purchase the London News Radio station and the \nDaily Express\u0014\n                 have also failed. At Harrods profits rose 6% last \nyear, but the\u0014\n                 company's debts increased to a staggering $264.3 \nmillion for the\u0014\n                 year ending January 1996. And financial sources told \nTIME that at\u0014\n                 least one international investment bank considered \nunderwriting a\u0014\n                 public offering of Harrods' stock but harbored \ndoubts because of\u0014\n                 continuing questions about al Fayed's reputation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 For his part, Emad (\"Dodi\") Fayed did not share his \nfather's\u0014\n                 relentless pursuit of British approbation. From an \nearly age he had a\u0014\n                 flair for the cosmopolitan, moving comfortably among \nEgyptian,\u0014\n                 French, Greek, American and British friends. He was \neducated at the\u0014\n                 St. Mark's school in Egypt, the Le Rosey school in \nSwitzerland and\u0014\n                 the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Childhood \nfriends\u0014\n                 remember him as pleasant and well bred, and touched \nby loneliness,\u0014\n                 owing in part to his parents' divorce. Says Zizette \nKishk, a family\u0014\n                 friend from Alexandria: \"He was a very shy and quiet \nboy who had\u0014\n                 somewhat of a sad air about him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Dodi's adolescence was spent shuttling among homes \nin Alexandria,\u0014\n                 Dubai and France. At 15 he was reportedly given his \nown Mayfair\u0014\n                 apartment, Rolls-Royce and chauffeur. He is said to \nhave\u0014\n                 abandoned a fledgling career in the United Arab \nEmirates air force in\u0014\n                 favor of one in show business, establishing a London \nfilm-production\u0014\n                 company in the late 1970s. \"He was financed by his \nfather,\"\u0014\n                 Khashoggi says. With the elder Fayed's help, Dodi \nsupplied $3\u0014\n                 million of the $6.5 million total budget for the \n1981 movie Chariots of\u0014\n                 Fire. In subsequent years he announced dozens of \nprojects that he\u0014\n                 later dropped, and most of his investments were \nmodest. \"Dodi didn't\u0014\n                 work a day in his life,\" says an industry insider. \n\"This is a guy who\u0014\n                 really enjoyed life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 He developed a reputation as a networking playboy \nwho didn't\u0014\n                 always pay his bills. His father provided him with a \nreported monthly\u0014\n                 allowance of $100,000, but he allegedly owed \nhundreds of\u0014\n                 thousands of dollars to landlords in L.A. and New \nYork City. Some of\u0014\n                 these accusations turned out to be ill founded, but \nat least one was\u0014\n                 still haunting him when he died. Kelly Fisher, the \nmodel who told\u0014\n                 tabloids in July that Dodi had pledged to marry her \neven as he\u0014\n                 squired Diana, accused him of writing checks to her \nthat bounced.\u0014\n                 Yet along with these complaints, Dodi had plenty of \nassociates willing\u0014\n                 to testify to his charm and affability. Khashoggi \ndescribed his sister's\u0014\n                 son as \"very quiet about life...a nice polite man, \nvery courteous.\"\u0014\n                 Says a close friend: \"He was with this one and that \none, but he was\u0014\n                 very nice with them... Even when the story ends, he \nwas very nice,\u0014\n                 acting like a gentleman.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Although they seemed to come from different worlds, \nDiana and Dodi\u0014\n                 were shaped by many of the same traumas--divorced \nparents, an\u0014\n                 unhappy first marriage and the death of a parent \n(Diana's father,\u0014\n                 Dodi's mother). The couple first met in 1986, at a \npolo match, but this\u0014\n                 summer, with the elder Fayed's prodding, the pair \ndeveloped an\u0014\n                 intimate bond. \"He was tres gentil, especially as \nPrincess Diana\u0014\n                 would have seen him,\" says Dodi's friend. \"All her \nlife she was\u0014\n                 meeting very cold people. He was a big change for \nher.\" Al Fayed\u0014\n                 spokesman Michael Cole recalled speaking to Dodi in \nAugust, after\u0014\n                 news of the romance had broken. \"Michael,\" Dodi \nsaid, \"I will never,\u0014\n                 ever, have another girlfriend.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 By the night of their death, the couple had decided \nto marry,\u0014\n                 according to some friends and relatives. Early in \nthe summer,\u0014\n                 Mohammed al Fayed cleared out the Windsor villa in \nFrance and put\u0014\n                 40,000 items on the auction block at Sotheby's. His \nfamily needed\u0014\n                 the extra space, al Fayed said, but some royal \nwatchers breathlessly\u0014\n                 speculated that he was preparing a retreat for his \nson and the\u0014\n                 Princess of Wales. Few things would have proved more \nnoisome to\u0014\n                 the royals than Diana, with an Egyptian husband and \nfather-in-law,\u0014\n                 spending time in the former residence of another \nexile from royalty. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 After the tragedy, al Fayed provided refreshments \nfrom Harrods to\u0014\n                 Britons waiting to sign Diana's condolence books. He \nchose not to\u0014\n                 return Dodi's body to Egypt, instead burying it at \nBrooklands\u0014\n                 Cemetery in Woking, an act that marked both his \ngrief and his\u0014\n                 unrealized dreams of British belonging. There will \nbe sympathy for\u0014\n                 him, but anger too from those who might blame the \nfamily for placing\u0014\n                 the princess in such mortal peril. Without prompting \nlast Friday, Cole\u0014\n                 said al Fayed had \"only wanted [Diana and Dodi] to \nbe happy and to\u0014\n                 get to know each other. The Fayed family wanted \nnothing from the\u0014\n                 princess.\" The surprise was that those words needed \nto be said at\u0014\n                 all. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 --Reported by Julie K.L.

    "words": "Where do \nhopes go?\u0014\n                      Teen suicide is a national tragedy. Here's one \ntown's  story\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Anna Mulrine \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It was after midnight when Michael Dombroski, \n13, took the keys to his\u0014\n                      father's Ford Bronco and picked 15-year-old \nJeff Barton up in front of his trim\u0014\n                      colonial home. For three hours the boys cruised \naround their small town,\u0014\n                      passing Mike's cellphone between them as they \nrelayed final wishes to\u0014\n                      friends: Share our CDs; tell our parents we \nlove them; don't tell anyone what\u0014\n                      we're about to do. Then, at 3:23 a.m., they \naimed the car at a 100-year-old\u0014\n                      giant spruce in front of the Congregational \nchurch and deliberately drove into\u0014\n                      it. In the crash, so violent that it melted \nmetal and glass into the road,\u0014\n                      Dombroski and Barton succeeded in doing what a \nstaggering 1.2 million\u0014\n                      American teenagers attempt each year: They \nkilled themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That crash took place one year ago on May 1. \nThis week the U.S. surgeon\u0014\n                      general is unveiling the first national plan to \nprevent suicide, which claims\u0014\n                      more lives each year than homicide. What's \nmore, the surgeon general says,\u0014\n                      the suicide rate is a national crisis, doubling \namong 10-to-14-year-olds in\u0014\n                      the past two decades, outpacing the toll of all \nnatural causes combined. The\u0014\n                      report emphasizes the dire need for mental \nhealth counseling in the schools\u0014\n                      and for more close-knit communities to nurture \nyoung people. These\u0014\n                      recommendations will no doubt evoke painful \nmemories in the picturesque\u0014\n                      community of East Haddam, Conn., which this \nweek looks back at last year's\u0014\n                      events and struggles to make sense of why two \nof its sons gave up hope.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      VANESSA CUNNINGHAM CLENCHes a determined fist \nas Katlin begins to\u0014\n                      cut her arm. \"Are you sure this doesn't hurt?\" \nasks the honor student,\u0014\n                      reluctantly drafting herself into this project. \nVanessa shakes her head no,\u0014\n                      and anyway, that's beside the point. Her biceps \nbears the thin traces of two\u0014\n                      letters, M and J, half an inch tall. But \nthey're fading, and she doesn't want that\u0014\n                      to happen again. At the very least, these \ninitials should be bigger, deeper;\u0014\n                      she's thinking 2 inches long. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Vanessa is a striking blond with sparkling blue \neyes, which are, more often\u0014\n                      than not, shrouded by the low-riding brim of \nher worn baseball cap. She tugs\u0014\n                      it down as she recalls the moment Mike told her \nhe was going to kill himself.\u0014\n                      Her head on his shoulder, they were sitting \nwhere she sits now, on a\u0014\n                      wine-stained couch that has seen better days. \n\"Two more weeks,\" Mike had\u0014\n                      said to any of the half-dozen eighth graders \nthat might listen. He seemed\u0014\n                      calm as he described his plan: Besides Jeff, \nhis new best friend, there were\u0014\n                      a couple of other kids who might want to go \ntoo, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Vanessa, 14, seriously considered being one of \nthem. Mike was, after all,\u0014\n                      one of her best friends. They had even dated in \nthe fifth grade. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And middle school hadn't been kind to either of \nthem. Printed beneath her\u0014\n                      yearbook photo are Vanessa's eighth-grade \nmemories: My first skateboard,\u0014\n                      my first basketball game, and waking up without \nmy mother one morning.\u0014\n                      After she lost her mom to the slow ravages of \ncancer, her grades tanked.\u0014\n                      The year before, she was voted best hustler on \nher basketball team; after her\u0014\n                      mother's death she stopped caring. Mike \nsympathized. His 15-year-old\u0014\n                      brother, Daniel, had died, the passenger of a \ndrunk driver who five months\u0014\n                      earlier had crashed into the very same spruce \ntree. They would talk about it\u0014\n                      on walks along the winding dirt roads of Moodus \nEstates, past yards\u0014\n                      peppered with rusting swing sets and old \nexercise equipment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Moodus Estates is the ghetto of East Haddam,\" \nVanessa explains, not\u0014\n                      without affection for the grand-sounding \nsubdivision. It is one of the few\u0014\n                      places she and her friends call their own in a \nrapidly changing town that\u0014\n                      offers them little in the way of support or \neven funa town struggling for its\u0014\n                      own bearings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fault lines. Set on the banks of the \nConnecticut River and home to the\u0014\n                      Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam makes a \nbright first impression.\u0014\n                      Here, elegant Victorians and colonials are more \naffordable than in\u0014\n                      neighboring Glastonbury and Lyme, where the \nwell-heeled tend to gravitate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the turn of the century, Polish \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nsettled here for jobs in the\u0014\n                      shipyard and netting factories. But after East \nHaddam's industry dwindled to\u0014\n                      one lumberyard and a handful of cotton twine \nmanufacturers, Poconos-style\u0014\n                      resorts catering to the New York elite took \ntheir place as the town's\u0014\n                      employment mainstay. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mike's father, Leonard Dombroski, a \nthird-generation resident, is a plumber.\u0014\n                      He works at one of the old resorts here. Lori \nDombroski, also a lifelong\u0014\n                      townie, works as a waitress in a neighboring \ntourist town. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Bartons, by contrast, are new arrivals. \nThey moved to East Haddam in\u0014\n                      the summer of 1999, drawn by the hemlock-lined \ngorges, post-and-beam\u0014\n                      barns, and old stone walls. They also \ndesperately wanted to give Jeff, who\u0014\n                      had struggled with school and drugs, a fresh \nstart, and this seemed the\u0014\n                      perfect place: 56 square miles and 7,200 \nresidents. Robin Barton liked the\u0014\n                      rural feel of the town, but, she confessed, she \nalso liked knowing that Jeff\u0014\n                      would need to rely on her to drive him where he \nwanted to go. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They bought in one of the many new subdivisions \nthat are springing up in\u0014\n                      East Haddam. It's a bedroom community for many \nnew residents who, like\u0014\n                      David Barton, commute to jobs in other places. \nThat fact, says historian and\u0014\n                      town dentist Karl Stofko, has created some \nfault lines in the once close-knit\u0014\n                      town. \"People buy homes, work somewhere else, \nstay five or six years, then\u0014\n                      move,\" he says. Indeed, an eerily prescient \nsurvey, commissioned by the\u0014\n                      town just a few months before the Bartons moved \nto East Haddam,\u0014\n                      documented this sense of disjointed community \nand its demoralizing\u0014\n                      consequences for the town's kids. A full 30 \npercent of the eighth graders at\u0014\n                      Nathan Hale-Ray Middle School said they were \ndepressed \"all or most of the\u0014\n                      time.\" A shocking 15 percent reported \nattempting suicide one or more\u0014\n                      timesnearly double the national average of 8.3 \npercent. Seventeen percent\u0014\n                      of eighth graders had been drunk at least once \nin the past two weeks, and\u0014\n                      an additional 18 percent reported taking \n\"illicit drugs\" three or more times in\u0014\n                      the past year. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But it was this question that disheartened Sue \nMerrow, the town's\u0014\n                      selectwoman, or mayor: \"Does your community \ncare about you?\" Four of\u0014\n                      every five of East Haddam's teens answered, \n\"No.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the turn of the century, in his seminal work \nSuicide, sociologist Emile\u0014\n                      Durkheim argued that self-destruction, though a \npersonal tragedy, is also a\u0014\n                      predictable consequence of the degree to which \none is not integrated into\u0014\n                      society. It's an observation that has been \nbolstered by new research, says\u0014\n                      Robert Putnam, professor of public policy at \nHarvard University and author of\u0014\n                      Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of the \nAmerican Community.\u0014\n                      Suicide is rarer among married people, rarer in \nmore tightly knit\u0014\n                      communities, and rarermuch rarerin intact \nfamilies. In fact, more than 70\u0014\n                      percent of teens who attempt suicide have \nparents who are divorced. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The town struggled to find solutions in the \nwake of the disturbing survey. It\u0014\n                      stepped up drug and alcohol abuse programs. It \ncreated an\u0014\n                      intergenerational garden to bridge the widening \ngap between old and young.\u0014\n                      \"But suicide was nothing we ever considered,\" \nMerrow says. They weren't\u0014\n                      alone: Across the country, teenagers rank \nsuicide as their fifth-biggest worry,\u0014\n                      after such concerns as pregnancy and drunk \ndriving. But when adults are\u0014\n                      asked what they believe to be their children's \nbiggest concerns, they place\u0014\n                      suicide 17th on the list. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Prevention programs are often woefully \ninadequate, when they exist at all.\u0014\n                      \"Suicide is the most . . . underresearched form \nof youth violence,\" says Lloyd\u0014\n                      Potter, a suicide expert formerly with the \nfederal Centers for Disease Control\u0014\n                      and Prevention. Indeed, barely one third of \nhigh school counselors across\u0014\n                      the country believe they would be able to \nrecognize the warning signs of\u0014\n                      suicide. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others find the subject too painful to \nconfront. At an emergency school board\u0014\n                      meeting the week after the suicides, \ncounselors, teachers, and school board\u0014\n                      members wrestled with damage control. There was \ngeneral agreement that\u0014\n                      some kind of town meeting was needed, but what \nto call it? \"Maybe\u0014\n                      something like 'A community response to teen \nsuicide'?\" suggested one\u0014\n                      counselor. \"Oh,\" said Merrow, wincing. \"We \ndon't want to say that. Do we?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Best intentions. One of the saddest aspects of \nteen suicide is the frequently\u0014\n                      missed opportunity to stop it: Seven of 10 kids \nwho kill themselves tell their\u0014\n                      friends about it first. Erin Smith, 15, can \nstill remember her mother, Susan,\u0014\n                      coming into her bedroom and waking her to tell \nher of Mike's death. \"The\u0014\n                      strange thing is that when Mom told me, it \nalmost made sense,\" says Erin.\u0014\n                      \"When Mikey and Jeff made up their minds to do \nsomething, they did it.\" The\u0014\n                      reality didn't sink in until later. \"His \ngrandmom didn't come out and wave to\u0014\n                      the bus like usual,\" says Erin. \"That,\" she \nsays, looking down at her purple\u0014\n                      flip-flops, \"is when it all began to feel just \ncompletely absurd.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Kelly Corey also bears a lot of guilt and \nsorrow over Mike's death. She was\u0014\n                      Mike's girlfriend up until two weeks before the \nboys died, before Jeff called\u0014\n                      her up one night to say that Mike wanted to \nbreak up. But even during those\u0014\n                      last two weeks, \"Mike kept calling,\" she says. \n\"I think he just really wanted to\u0014\n                      talk.\" He spoke of suicide, but she laments: \n\"They made everyone swear on\u0014\n                      Mike's brother's grave not to tell anyone about \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      David Schwartz, 15, also knew of the boys' \nplan. He actually tried to figure out\u0014\n                      ways to stop them, like slashing the tires of \nthe Bronco. But he never\u0014\n                      considered going to an adult. \"Who would we \ntell?\" asks David. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Robin, Jeff's mom, already had lots of reasons \nto be worried about her son's\u0014\n                      emotional state. His A's and B's had recently \nturned into failing grades. He\u0014\n                      quit the swimming and golf teams. \"Then there \nwas the time he woke up and\u0014\n                      said, 'Mom, I just don't have a happy day.' \" \nBoth Jeff and Mike struggled with\u0014\n                      a medical condition thought to affect an \nestimated 80 percent of teenagers\u0014\n                      who commit suicide: depression. But like the \nmajority of parents whose\u0014\n                      children suffer from depression, Robin had \nnever experienced the illness\u0014\n                      herself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So she responded intuituvely. She bought books \non child development. She\u0014\n                      bought Jeff cards. \"I'd give him little \nHallmark greetings like '12 Ways to\u0014\n                      Smile' because I knew he was hurting.\" Robin \nalso began meeting with\u0014\n                      Principal Craig Edmundson every week. And she \nenrolled Jeff in after-school\u0014\n                      therapy. For five hours a day, he attended \ngroup counseling, substance\u0014\n                      abuse counseling, and anger management \nsessions. On the night of his\u0014\n                      suicide, Jeff found his mother eating her \ncustomary midnight bowl of cereal.\u0014\n                      \"We said, 'I love you,' and I kissed him good \nnight,\" Robin recalls. \"And I told\u0014\n                      him to go to bed soon.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mike's grades, never stellar, were suffering, \ntoo. Friends say he was coming\u0014\n                      to class stoned, and teachers had referred him \nto the principal for angry\u0014\n                      outbursts in class. The kids continued to pass \ntheir time in Moodus Estates,\u0014\n                      riding motorized dirt bikes around courses they \nbuilt themselves. They\u0014\n                      lamented the fact that their town still hadn't \nbuilt the skateboard park it had\u0014\n                      promised them, and that the police chased them \nout of the town's small\u0014\n                      shopping center when they tried to skate there. \nFrustrated, Vanessa sold her\u0014\n                      skateboard and bought a cellphone instead. Soon \nafter Mike's brother died,\u0014\n                      the kids found a new hangout: the cemetery. \nThey spent hours decorating\u0014\n                      the tree in front of the neighboring \nCongregational church with hemp\u0014\n                      necklaces and adorning the grave with Big Gulp \ncups and CDs, including\u0014\n                      Jimi Hendrix's Ultimate Experience. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the last two weeks of their lives, the boys \nspoke often of suicide. \"I told Jeff\u0014\n                      it's a sin to kill yourself,\" says Robin, \nshuddering. \"He said, 'I'd just ask\u0014\n                      Jesus to forgive me when I get there.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"God bless Oprah.\" It is first Communion day at \nFirst Church of Christ\u0014\n                      Congregational, and the Rev. Lyle Ashby is \nstruggling to explain the deaths\u0014\n                      of Jeff and Mike to the boys and girls sitting \nin the front pew of the graceful,\u0014\n                      doric-columned parish. He is talking about \n\"dark days of souls,\" and the kids\u0014\n                      look a bit puzzled. \"Sometimes, you will have \nthem,\" he says. He has to say\u0014\n                      something. \"And when you do, where can you go?\" \nhe asks. They venture\u0014\n                      answers. \"Friends,\" offers one. \"Parents,\" says \nanother. \"God?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      God is the one element that Ashby feels was \nleft out of the conversation\u0014\n                      following the suicides. He found it \nparticularly frustrating that the church was\u0014\n                      not invited to be a part of the crisis response \nteam after the suicides. What's\u0014\n                      more, he's ashamed of the way the church and \nschool have failed to work\u0014\n                      together. He confesses: \"I don't have a sense \nthat we know how.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It was church secretary Justine Cancyrn who \ncame up with a plan of action,\u0014\n                      after tuning in to the Oprah Winfrey show \nshortly after the boys died. \"God\u0014\n                      bless Oprahshe was doing suicide prevention \nthat day.\" Justine liked the\u0014\n                      sound of the Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention \nProgram and downloaded\u0014\n                      the brochures from its Web site. She called \nRobin, and the two began a\u0014\n                      grass-roots campaign to educate the town about \nsuicide. One year later, they\u0014\n                      are active in their community and even in \nneighboring states, driving to\u0014\n                      Delaware and Massachusetts to talk about \nsuicide's warning signs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE ONE YEAR ago, the \nchildren sat silently as\u0014\n                      Robin and Lori took the podium. Lori began with \na powerful plea. \"Don't even\u0014\n                      think about it,\" she said, pointing at them as \nshe enunciated each word. After\u0014\n                      the service, Robin madly jotted down her \ntelephone number on scraps of\u0014\n                      paper, handing them out to the children who \nwere gathered on the church\u0014\n                      steps. \"Call me,\" she told them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      David Schwartz has regularly taken her up on \nthe offer. He concedes that,\u0014\n                      even as he was plotting to keep Mike and Jeff \nalive, another part of him had\u0014\n                      considered riding with them that night. \"It's \none of those things where you\u0014\n                      realize, 'What was I thinking?' \" On David's \nfirst visit, Robin welcomed him\u0014\n                      with apple bran muffins and showed him Jeff's \nexercise equipment. She had\u0014\n                      had cable installed in the basement, she tells \nhim, so that Jeff could watch\u0014\n                      MTV while he bench-pressed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      David has continued to visit frequently over \nthe past year. Since the day that\u0014\n                      Robin promised him $10 for each A on his report \ncard, David has made the\u0014\n                      honor roll twice. \"I'm out 100 bucks,\" notes \nRobin happily. David and\u0014\n                      Vanessa now play a lot of pickup basketball \ntogether, and Vanessa is\u0014\n                      thinking about rejoining the team next year. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      East Haddam, for its part, is determined to \nmake sure the kids don't have to\u0014\n                      heal alone. The town is planning a youth center \nwith pool tables, music, and\u0014\n                      snacks. Town officials have again promised the \nkids a skateboard park,\u0014\n                      though it's still not been built. The church \nhas been hosting teen dances,\u0014\n                      which kids are actually attending. Ashby plans \nto hire a youth\u0014\n                      pastorsomeone, he hopes, who will convince the \nchildren that confirmation\u0014\n                      does not mean graduation from church. Anything, \ncommunity members say,\u0014\n                      to prove to their teens that this is a town \nthat cares. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                              \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nSubscribe to\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \ne-newsletter \u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nE-mail this page to a\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nfriend \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nCurriculum for crisis: Why\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nyour children's school should\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nhave an emergency plan\u0014\n\n                                                                              \n(11/9/98) \u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nDo you know where your\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nchildren are?

If the Bible is to\u0014\n               be believed, alienation from God is the natural\u0014\n               habitat of humanity and evil its full-blown\u0014\n               manifestation. Indeed, the word evil appears\u0014\n               more often in the Christian Scriptures than\u0014\n               goodand with reason.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  FROM THE BIBLICAL perspective, our \nnatural\u0014\n                          inclination is to serve ourselves rather \nthan Godand in\u0014\n                          the case of a man like Timothy McVeigh, to \nmete out\u0014\n                          retribution as if he were God himself. In \nthis view, evil\u0014\n                          acts are born of inordinate pride, a moral \nweakness that\u0014\n                          manifests itself as strength. Even saints \nmust conquer\u0014\n                          festering self-regard. I can will what is \nright, but I cannot\u0014\n                          do it, the Apostle Paul confesses. For I \ndo not do the\u0014\n                          good I want, but the evil I do not want is \nwhat I do.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  On this side of paradise, doing \nevil seems to come\u0014\n                          more naturallyand certainly more \neasilythan doing\u0014\n                          good. There are no innocents: we are all \nchildren of\u0014\n                          darkness struggling toward the light.\u0014\n                                  This is why every religion aims at \na radical\u0014\n                          transformation of the self and provides \nmoral guidelines\u0014\n                          for becoming holy in Gods sight. Jews rely \non the laws of\u0014\n                          Moses and the wisdom of the Talmud; \nChristians look to\u0014\n                          the teachings of Jesus, the guidance of the \nHoly Spirit\u0014\n                          and especially the power of transforming \ngrace; Muslims\u0014\n                          seek transformation through total \nsubmission to Allah,\u0014\n                          guided by the recitation of the Quran and \nthe example of\u0014\n                          Muhammad.

In the most\u0014\n                          ancient faiths, evil in the form of chaos \nprecedes the\u0014\n                          advent of human beings, who merely continue \nit by\u0014\n                          opposing divine order.\u0014\n                                  Hinduism and Buddhism both have \nnumerous and\u0014\n                          overlapping myths involving evil gods and \ndemons. But\u0014\n                          philosophically they rely on the powerful \ndoctrine of\u0014\n                          karma, which explains the evil in this life \nas the fruit of\u0014\n                          past thoughts and actions in every \nindividuals previous\u0014\n                          lives. In Buddhism especially, an abundance \nof bad\u0014\n                          karma can produce a future rebirth in one \nof several\u0014\n                          hells. But for the Buddha, the real evil is \nexistence itself,\u0014\n                          since all sentient beings are subject to \nsuffering, death\u0014\n                          and rebirth. In his view, these evils are \nultimately rooted\u0014\n                          in our attachment to the illusion of a \npermanent self. In\u0014\n                          short, evil is explained as ignorance, and \nthe only way to\u0014\n                          escape the endless cycle of death and \nrebirth is to\u0014\n                          realize our own emptiness through \nmeditation techniques\u0014\n                          aimed at destroying the illusory sense of \nself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          Every monotheism, on the other hand, must\u0014\n                          struggle with a metaphysical conundrum: how \nto explain the \u0014\n                          existence of evil in a world governed by a \nsingle creator God\u0014\n                          whoby the definition of the Hebrew \nprophetsis both all-powerful\u0014\n                          and all-good. (Though the Lord is a \ncomplicated figure: in the Book of\u0014\n                          Job, for example, God emerges as an \narbitrary and incomprehensible\u0014\n                          deity even to the righteous.) Judaism, \nChristianity and Islam all\u0014\n                          look to the myth of Eden, where evil enters \nthe world through the\u0014\n                          disobedience of Adam and Eve, humanitys \nprimal parents. From this                                moral \nfailure, natural evils like suffering and death become our \ncommon                             lot, as does the propensity to do \nevil rather than good. In each of these\u0014\n                          religions, traditions have added second \nthoughts and\u0014\n                          refined reflections. In Jewish mysticism, \nthe Lord\u0014\n                          withdraws from the world he has created, \nleaving it up to\u0014\n                          humankind to repair the breach. In Islam, \nevil arises\u0014\n                          whenever the relativity of this world is \nmistaken for the\u0014\n                          Absolute that is Allah; avoiding evil means \nasserting the\u0014\n                          oneness of God and rejecting every form of \nidolatry,\u0014\n                          especially of the self. \u0014\n   \u0014\n       It's biological--an abnormality in the brain\u0014\n\u0014\n       It's brought on by mental illness\u0014\n\u0014\n       It's caused by poor upbringing\u0014\n\u0014\n       It's within all of us, but not every one acts on it\u0014\n     \u0014\n                                  For Western culture, the most \ninfluential theory has\u0014\n                          been the Christian theology of Saint \nAugustine, produced\u0014\n                          during the dissolution of the Roman Empire. \nAs a young\u0014\n                          man, Augustine was a Manichaean, believing \nthat the\u0014\n                          cosmos was torn between equally powerful \nforces of\u0014\n                          good and evil. But in his later writings as \na Christian,\u0014\n                          Augustine identified evil as the \nprivation of the gooda\u0014\n                          sort of black hole in the orders of \ncreation that works\u0014\n                          against the good God wills for all that he \nhas brought into\u0014\n                          being. From this perspective, evil shadows \nthe good like\u0014\n                          antimatter to matter; it has no existence \nin itself, but is\u0014\n                          immensely powerful in its ability to negate \nwhat is\u0014\n                          andmorally speakingwhat ought to be. For\u0014\n                          Christians, only the gift of Gods own \ngrace can\u0014\n                          overcome the power of evil in the world and \nsanctify the\u0014\n                          life of the believer.\u0014\n                                  Radical evilthe kind embodied in a \nHitler, Stalin or\u0014\n                          Pol Potis personified in the image of \nSatan; those\u0014\n                          20th-century tyrants possess a malevolence \nthat seems\u0014\n                          beyond the human. A figure condensed from \nearly Jewish\u0014\n                          and Christian apocalyptic writings, Satan \nis a pure spirit\u0014\n                          created good by God who rebelled of his own \nfree will\u0014\n                          and was cast for all eternity from Gods \npresence. He\u0014\n                          remains, for many believers today, a malign \npersonality\u0014\n                          of immense intelligence and cunning who \ntempts a fallen\u0014\n                          humanity but can never force anyone to do \nevil. In short,\u0014\n                          evil in its classical Christian formulation \nis the\u0014\n                          nothing-ness that God permits, that the \nDevil wills and\u0014\n                          promotes, and that human beings freely \nchoose when\u0014\n                          they sin. Dante captured all these facets \nin his\u0014\n                          magnificent depiction of hell. There \nLucifer, the once\u0014\n                          brilliant angel of light, now fallen from \nheaven through the\u0014\n                          earth to its core, is stuck fast and in a \nlake of ice. Where\u0014\n                          God is warmth and plenitude and light, \nSatan is cold,\u0014\n                          dark and trapped in the narrowness of the \nself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          As the subject of art and poetry, Satan is \na window on the changing\u0014\n                          conceptions of evil. In Miltons Paradise \nLost he became a proud\u0014\n                          rebel: Tis better to reign in Hell than \nserve in Heaven. Milton knew\u0014\n                          what he was doing, observes historian \nJeffrey Burton Russell.\u0014\n                          He made Satan an ttractive figure, Russell\u0014\n                          says, so we would see ourselves in him. \nLater,\u0014\n                          Romantic poets liked what they saw, \ntransforming Satan\u0014\n                          into a Promethean figure who challenges the \nforces of\u0014\n                          repression. By the 20th century, Satan had \nlargely\u0014\n                          disappeared from Western consciousness. The \nself\u0014\n                          became the only interesting place to be: \nHell, Jean-Paul\u0014\n                          Sartre observed, is other people.\u0014\n                                  Evil, though, is not so easily \ndismissed. Today we\u0014\n                          experience evil as a random menace, devoid \nof cosmic\u0014\n                          significance. We look at people like \nMcVeigh and\u0014\n                          measure our distance from him. But deep \ndown we fear\u0014\n                          that it is just a matter of inches. And so \nacross the\u0014\n                          centuries we pray to be delivered from our \nenemies and\u0014\n                          our own shortcomingsto be delivered, \nultimately, from\u0014\n                          evil.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                                  2001 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

The same \ntectonic forces that racked the region with\u0014\n                                       earthquakes and volcanic \neruptions had also thrust the land up as much\u0014\n                                       as a mile higher than it is \ntoday. As a result, the area was cooler and\u0014\n                                       wetter and overgrown with \ntrees, bushes and patches of grass. These\u0014\n                                       fertile woodlands were rich in \nwildlife. Primitive elephants, giant bears,\u0014\n                                       horses, rhinos, pigs, rats and \nmonkeys lived here, along with dozens of\u0014\n                                       other mammal species long \nsince extinct. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       And it was here too that \nnature indulged in what was perhaps her\u0014\n                                       greatest evolutionary \nexperiment. For it was in eastern Africa at about\u0014\n                                       this time that a new type of \nprimate arosean animal not so different\u0014\n                                       from its apelike ancestors \nexcept in one crucial respect: this creature\u0014\n                                       stood on two legs instead of \nscurrying along chimplike on all fours. Its\u0014\n                                       knuckle-walking cousins would \nstay low to the ground and never get\u0014\n                                       much smarter. But while it \nwouldn't happen until millions of years in the\u0014\n                                       future, this new primate's \nevolutionary descendants would eventually\u0014\n                                       develop a large, complex \nbrain. And from that would spring all of\u0014\n                                       civilization, from Mesopotamia \nto Mozart to Who Wants to Be a\u0014\n                                       Millionaire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       That's the broad outline, \nanyway. While this view of human evolution\u0014\n                                       has generally been accepted by \nscientists for decades, no one has yet\u0014\n                                       been able to say precisely \nwhen that first evolutionary step on the road\u0014\n                                       to humanity happened, nor what \nmight have triggered it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But a discovery reported last \nweek in the journal Nature has brought\u0014\n                                       paleontologists tantalizingly \nclose to answering both these questions.\u0014\n                                       Working as part of an \ninternational team led by U.S. and Ethiopian\u0014\n                                       scientists, a graduate student \nnamed Yohannes Haile-Selassie (no\u0014\n                                       relation to the Emperor), \nenrolled at the University of California,\u0014\n                                       Berkeley, has found the \nremains of what appears to be the most ancient\u0014\n                                       human ancestor ever \ndiscovered.

He had set out to better\u0014\n                                       understand how the ancient \necosystems worked and evolved. \"I didn't\u0014\n                                       even think about finding \nhominids,\" he says. \"All I wanted to do was\u0014\n                                       collect enough vertebrate \nbones so that I could write my dissertation.\" In\u0014\n                                       December 1997, though, at a \nplace called Alayla, he spotted a piece of\u0014\n                                       jawbone lying on the \nrock-strewn ground. \"I picked up the mandible less\u0014\n                                       than five minutes after we got \nthere,\" he recalls, \"but didn't realize I had\u0014\n                                       something really special until \na year later, when we found some more\u0014\n                                       bones and I started the \nserious analysis.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       In all, the team eventually \nfound 11 specimensfrom at least five\u0014\n                                       different individualsin a \ncluster of sites, including Haile-Selassie's\u0014\n                                       partial lower jaw with \nassociated teeth, several hand and foot bones,\u0014\n                                       and pieces of three arm bones \nand a collarbone. Luckily, the fossils\u0014\n                                       were trapped in sediments that \nwere sandwiched between layers of\u0014\n                                       volcanic ash, whose age can be \naccurately gauged by a technique\u0014\n                                       known as argon-argon dating. \n(This layering is still visible in places that\u0014\n                                       have not been so heavily \neroded, enabling the scientists to trace the\u0014\n                                       area's geologic history.) The \nverdict, confirmed by a second dating\u0014\n                                       method and by the other \nprimitive animals found with the hominid\u0014\n                                       remains: most of the fossils \nare between 5.6 million and 5.8 million years\u0014\n                                       old, although one toe bone is \na few hundred thousand years younger. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       It was the detailed anatomy of \nthese fragmentary fossils, especially the\u0014\n                                       teeth, that convinced \nHaile-Selassie that he had discovered a new\u0014\n                                       human ancestor. Although \napelike, the lower canines and upper\u0014\n                                       premolars, in particular, \ndisplay certain traits found only in the teeth of\u0014\n                                       later hominidsthe term \nscientists use to describe ourselves and our\u0014\n                                       non-ape ancestors. They also \ndiffer in shape from the teeth of all known\u0014\n                                       fossil and modern apes. Even \nthe way in which the teeth had been worn\u0014\n                                       down was telling. Explains \nHaile-Selassie's thesis adviser, Berkeley\u0014\n                                       paleontologist Tim White: \n\"Apes all sharpen their upper canines as they\u0014\n                                       chew. Hominids don't.\" The new \ncreature's back teeth are larger than a\u0014\n                                       chimp's too, while the front \nteeth are narrower, suggesting that its diet\u0014\n                                       included a variety of fibrous \nfoods, rather than the fruits and soft leaves\u0014\n                                       that chimps prefer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       When Haile-Selassie compared \nthe newly discovered bones and teeth\u0014\n                                       with those of Ardipithecus \nramidus, a 4.4 million-year-old hominid found\u0014\n                                       in the Middle Awash in the \nearly 1990s that was the previous record\u0014\n                                       holder, he realized that the \ntwo creatures were very similar. But the\u0014\n                                       older one's teeth, while \ndifferent from an ape's, do have a number of\u0014\n                                       characteristics that are \ndecidedly more apelike than those of the\u0014\n                                       younger hominid. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       On the basis of these minor \nbut distinctive differences, Haile-Selassie\u0014\n                                       decided to classify the new \nhuman ancestor as a subspecies, or variant,\u0014\n                                       of ramidus and has given it \nthe name Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba.\u0014\n                                       (The name is derived from the \nlocal Afar language. Ardi means ground\u0014\n                                       or floor; ramid means root; \nand kadabba means basal family ancestor.\u0014\n                                       In accordance with the \nsometimes bizarre nomenclature of science, the\u0014\n                                       younger creature now gets \nrenamed Ardipithecus ramidus .) \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Haile-Selassie and his \ncolleagues haven't collected enough bones yet to\u0014\n                                       reconstruct with great \nprecision what kadabba looked like. But they do\u0014\n                                       know it was about the size of \nmodern common chimpanzees, which when\u0014\n                                       standing average about 4 ft. \ntall. That makes it roughly the same size as\u0014\n                                       its close relative A. ramidus \nramidus and about 20% taller than Lucy, the\u0014\n                                       famous 3.2 million-year-old \nhuman ancestor discovered about 50 miles\u0014\n                                       away in 1974 that is even \nfurther along the evolutionary track. The size\u0014\n                                       of kadabba's brain and the \nrelative proportions of its arms and legs\u0014\n                                       were probably chimplike as \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But unlike a chimp or any of \nthe other modern apes that amble along on\u0014\n                                       four limbs, kadabba almost \ncertainly walked upright much of the time.\u0014\n                                       The inch-long toe bone makes \nthat clear. Two-legged primates (modern\u0014\n                                       humans included) propel \nthemselves forward by leaving the front part of\u0014\n                                       their foot on the ground and \nlifting the heel. This movement, referred to\u0014\n                                       as toeing off, causes the \nbones in the middle of the foot to take on a\u0014\n                                       distinctive shapea shape that \nis readily apparent in the ancient toe\u0014\n                                       bone. \"If you compare a \nchimp's foot bones with its hand bones, they\u0014\n                                       look the same because they're \nused for the same thing\"that is, for\u0014\n                                       graspingHaile-Selassie \nexplains. \"Hominid fingers and toes don't look\u0014\n                                       alike at all.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Exactly how this hominid \nwalked is still something of a mystery, though\u0014\n                                       with a different skeletal \nstructure, its gait would have been unlike ours.\u0014\n                                       Details of kadabba's lifestyle \nremain speculative too, but many of its\u0014\n                                       behaviors undoubtedly \nresembled those of chimpanzees today. It\u0014\n                                       probably still spent some time \nin trees. It probably lived in large social\u0014\n                                       groups that would include both \nsexes. And rather than competing with\u0014\n                                       one another for mates, the \nmales may well have banded together to\u0014\n                                       defend the troop against \npredators, forage for food and even hunt for\u0014\n                                       game.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But that kadabba walked \nupright at all is hugely significant.\u0014\n                                       Paleontologists have suspected \nfor nearly 200 years that bipedalism\u0014\n                                       was probably the key \nevolutionary transition that split the human line off\u0014\n                                       from the apes, and fossil \ndiscoveries as far back as Java Man in the\u0014\n                                       1890s supported that notion. \nThe astonishingly complete skeleton of\u0014\n                                       Lucy, with its clearly apelike \nskull but upright posture, cemented the idea\u0014\n                                       a quarter-century ago. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       What's been much tougher to \npin down is just why two-leggedness\u0014\n                                       arose. The conventional wisdom \nhas long focused on the fact that\u0014\n                                       eastern Africa became \nsignificantly dryer about the time that humans\u0014\n                                       first evolved. The change \nwould have tended to favor grasslands over\u0014\n                                       forests, and, so went the \ntheory, our ancestors changed to take\u0014\n                                       advantage of the new \nconditions. We learned to walk upright so that we\u0014\n                                       could see over the tall \ngrasses to spot predators coming; an upright\u0014\n                                       posture, moreover, would offer \na much smaller target for the oppressive\u0014\n                                       heat of the grassland sun, and \na larger target for cooling breezes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       The only trouble with this \ntheory is that it's wrong. The earliest humans,\u0014\n                                       it turns out, didn't live in \ngrasslands. Dry climate or not, a companion\u0014\n                                       paper published last week in \nNature shows on the basis of the other\u0014\n                                       fossilized flora and fauna, as \nwell as the chemistry of the ancient soil,\u0014\n                                       that Ardipithecus ramidus \nkadabba lived in a well-forested environment.\u0014\n                                       That's also the case with \nother extremely ancient hominids found during\u0014\n                                       the past several years, \nincluding Ardipithecus ramidus and a species\u0014\n                                       called Orrorin tugenensis , \nannounced last December by French and\u0014\n                                       Kenyan researchers. And while \nthe ability to walk on two legs probably\u0014\n                                       started out as an increasingly \nfrequent behavior, evolution demands an\u0014\n                                       explanation for why it \npersisted. On first blush, bipedalism just doesn't\u0014\n                                       make much sense. For our \nearliest ancestors, it would have been slower\u0014\n                                       than walking on all fours, \nwhile requiring the same amount of energy.\u0014\n                                       Says Lovejoy bluntly: \"It's \nunnatural. It's bizarre.\"\u0014\n                                       Yet the advantages of walking \nupright were somehow so great that the\u0014\n                                       behavior endured through \nthousands of generations. Indeed, the\u0014\n                                       anatomy of our ancestors \nunderwent all sorts of basic changes to\u0014\n                                       accommodate this new way of \nmoving. Many of the changes help the\u0014\n                                       body stay balanced by \nstabilizing the weight-bearing leg and keeping\u0014\n                                       the upper torso centered over \nthe feet. Lovejoy, who studies the\u0014\n                                       anatomy and biomechanics of \nlocomotion, thinks the changes may have\u0014\n                                       improved coordination as well. \n\"To walk upright in a habitual way, you\u0014\n                                       have to do so in synchrony,\" \nhe says. \"If the ligaments and muscles are\u0014\n                                       out of synch, that leads to \ninjuries. And then you'd be cheetah meat.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       By far the most crucial \nchanges, according to Lovejoy, were those in the\u0014\n                                       spine. The distance between \nchest and pelvis is longer in humans than\u0014\n                                       in apes, allowing the lower \nspine to curve, which locates the upper body\u0014\n                                       over the pelvis for balance. \nThe pelvis grew broader, meanwhile, and\u0014\n                                       humans developed a hip joint \nand associated muscles that stabilize the\u0014\n                                       pelvis. Explains Lovejoy: \n\"That's why a chimp sways from side to side as\u0014\n                                       it walks upright and humans \ndon't.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Changes also had to take place \nin the femur, or thighbone. For\u0014\n                                       example, the femoral neckthe \nbent portion at the top of the boneis\u0014\n                                       broader in humans than it is \nin apes, which improves balance. The\u0014\n                                       human knee is specialized for \nwalking upright too: to compensate for the\u0014\n                                       thighbone's being at an angle, \nthere's a lump, or groove, at the end of\u0014\n                                       the femur that prevents the \npatella from sliding off the joint. \"A chimp\u0014\n                                       doesn't have this groove \nbecause there is no angulation between the\u0014\n                                       hip and the knee,\" Lovejoy \nsays. \"This change says you're a biped.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Finally, there's the foot. \n\"What's important here is the arch,\" Lovejoy\u0014\n                                       says. \"It's a really important \nshock absorber. It's like wearing a good pair\u0014\n                                       of running shoes.\" In order to \ncreate that arch, the chimp's opposable\u0014\n                                       great toe became aligned with \nthe others, and the toe's muscles and\u0014\n                                       ligaments, which had been used \nfor grasping and climbing, were\u0014\n                                       repositioned under the foot. \n\"The shape of the big toe is indicative of\u0014\n                                       this. You can see it in Lucy's \nspecies,\" Lovejoy says, but not in the bone\u0014\n                                       Haile-Selassie found, because \nit's from a different toe. \"What we can\u0014\n                                       see [in the new discovery's \nfoot] is that the base of the bone adjacent to\u0014\n                                       the knuckle has a distinct \nangle, showing that the creature walked step\u0014\n                                       after step after step with its \nheel off the ground, using the front of its foot\u0014\n                                       as a platform.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       That's how it walked. Why it \nwalked is tougher to understand, since\u0014\n                                       motivation leaves behind no \nphysical remains. But armed with\u0014\n                                       knowledge about our ancestors' \nphysical attributes and the environment\u0014\n                                       that surrounded them, \nscientists have come up with several theories.\u0014\n                                       Anthropologist Henry McHenry, \nof the University of California, Davis, for\u0014\n                                       example, champions the idea \nthat climate variation was part of the\u0014\n                                       picture after all. When Africa \ndried out, say McHenry and his colleague\u0014\n                                       Peter Rodman, the change left \npatches of forest widely spaced between\u0014\n                                       open savannah. The first \nhominids lived mostly in these forest refuges\u0014\n                                       but couldn't find enough food \nin any one place. Learning to walk on two\u0014\n                                       legs helped them travel long \ndistances over ground to the next woodsy\u0014\n                                       patch, and thus to more food.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Meave Leakey, head of \npaleontology at the National Museums of Kenya\u0014\n                                       and a member of the world's \nmost famous fossil-hunting family, suspects\u0014\n                                       the change in climate rewarded \nbipedalism for a different reason. Yes,\u0014\n                                       the dryer climate made for \nmore grassland, but our early ancestors, she\u0014\n                                       argues, spent much of their \ntime not in dense forest or on the savannah\u0014\n                                       but in an environment with \nsome trees, dense shrubbery and a bit of\u0014\n                                       grass. \"And if you're moving \ninto more open country with grasslands and\u0014\n                                       bushes and things like this, \nand eating a lot of fruits and berries coming\u0014\n                                       off low bushes, there is a \nhell of an advantage to be able to reach\u0014\n                                       higher. That's why the gerenuk \n[a type of antelope] evolved its long\u0014\n                                       neck and stands on its hind \nlegs, and why the giraffe evolved its long\u0014\n                                       neck. There's strong pressure \nto be able to reach a wider range of\u0014\n                                       levels.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But for Kent State's Lovejoy, \nthe real answer is sex. Males who were\u0014\n                                       best at walking upright would \nget more of it, leading to more offspring\u0014\n                                       who were good on two legs, who \nin turn got more sex. His reasoning,\u0014\n                                       first proposed nearly two \ndecades ago, goes like this: like many modern\u0014\n                                       Americans, monkeys and apes of \nboth genders work outside the\u0014\n                                       homein the latter case, \nsearching for food. Early humans, though,\u0014\n                                       discovered the Leave It to \nBeaver strategy: if males handled the\u0014\n                                       breadwinning, females could \nstay closer to home and devote more time\u0014\n                                       to rearing the children, thus \ngiving them a better shot at growing up\u0014\n                                       strong and healthy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       And if you're going to bring \nhome the bacon, or the Miocene equivalent,\u0014\n                                       it helps to have your hands \nfree to carry it. Over time, female apes\u0014\n                                       would choose to mate only with \nthose males who brought them\u0014\n                                       foodpresumably the ones who \nwere best adapted for upright walking.\u0014\n                                       Is that the way it actually \nhappened? Maybe, but we may never know for\u0014\n                                       sure. Leakey, for one, is \nunconvinced. \"There are all sorts of\u0014\n                                       hypotheses,\" she says, \"and \nthey are all fairy tales really because you\u0014\n                                       can't prove anything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       If paleontologists argue about \nwhy bipedalism evolved, they're even\u0014\n                                       more contentious over the \norganization of the human family tree.\u0014\n                                       According to Haile-Selassie \nand his colleagues, the picture looks pretty\u0014\n                                       straightforward from about 5.8 \nmillion years ago to the present. First\u0014\n                                       comes Ardipithecus ramidus \nkadabba, the newest find. Then, more than\u0014\n                                       a million years later, its \ndescendant, the newly renamed Ardipithecus\u0014\n                                       ramidus , appears. After that \ncomes a new genus, called\u0014\n                                       Australopithecus (where Lucy \nbelongs), and finally, about 2 million years\u0014\n                                       ago, the first members of the \nhuman genus Homo.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       But not everyone buys the \nstory. Indeed, the French and Kenyan team\u0014\n                                       that presented a 6 \nmillion-year-old fossil last December insists that\u0014\n                                       theirs, known as Orrorin \ntugenensis (or, more familiarly, Millennium Man\u0014\n                                       because it was announced in \n2000), is the true human ancestor and\u0014\n                                       that Ardipithecus is nothing \nmore than a monkey's uncleor a chimp's\u0014\n                                       great-great-grandfather, \nanyway. They even dismiss Lucy and her close\u0014\n                                       kin, about as firmly \nentrenched in the human lineage as you can get, as\u0014\n                                       evolutionary dead ends that \nleft no living descendants. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       No one disputes that this \ncompeting ancestor is 6 million years old and\u0014\n                                       thus more ancient than \nArdipithecus. What's still to be proved is that it's\u0014\n                                       a hominid. Says Leakey: \"If \nyou read their paper, almost everything they\u0014\n                                       say about the teeth suggests \nit's more apelike.\" And when they get to\u0014\n                                       the femur, she says, they \npresent no evidence disproving that it walked\u0014\n                                       on all fours. Haile-Selassie \nmakes precisely the same point. But Brigitte\u0014\n                                       Senut of the National Museum \nof Natural History in Paris and Martin\u0014\n                                       Pickford, chairman of \npaleoanthropology and prehistory at the College\u0014\n                                       de France, co-leaders of the \nteam that found Orrorin, dismiss the\u0014\n                                       criticisms. Additional fossils \nfound just last March, they say, along with\u0014\n                                       the more detailed analysis \nthey now have in hand of the earlier bones,\u0014\n                                       will prove their case. \"We are \nabsolutely delighted about it,\" says Senut.\u0014\n                                       \"We had the possibility to \nshow the evidence to some colleagues in\u0014\n                                       South Africa recently, and \njust looking at the cast they said, Fantastic,\u0014\n                                       it's a biped! And a better \nbiped than Lucy.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Even if they're right, though, \nestablishing the precise path of human\u0014\n                                       descent might be very hard. \nFor most of the past 6 million years,\u0014\n                                       multiple hominid species \nroamed the earth at the same timeincluding\u0014\n                                       a mere 30,000 years ago, when \nmodern humans and Neanderthals still\u0014\n                                       coexisted.

    "words": "Our Three Deepest Needs\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago on television, a public speaker was giving a talk \nabout the\u0014\nthree deepest needs we have as persons. What would you imagine those \nto be?\u0014\nThe first need we have, the speaker said, is to know someone who will \nlisten\u0014\nto us. We all have a story to tell, a need to verbalize our feelings. \nWe\u0014\nwant someone who will listen to that. Secondly, he claimed, we want \nthe\u0014\nperson listening to believe what we are saying. We want someone who \nwill\u0014\ntrust our story. Finally, the television speaker said that when we \nhave\u0014\nfound such a person who listens to us and trusts us, we want to be \nassured\u0014\nthat such a person is on our side. We don't want to be involved with \nsomeone\u0014\nwho will misuse or abuse our story (through gossip, for instance), \nbut who\u0014\nwill remain on our side, perhaps despite our story.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom personal experience I'd say the speaker touched on an important \naspect\u0014\nof our deepest need as people. The promise of prayer -- of Christian\u0014\nprayer -- is that for the sake of Jesus Christ our Savior, a loving \nFather\u0014\nis ready to listen to you and me; as God listens, we may be assured \nthat God\u0014\nis on our side all the way. This is the promise of prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard W. Patt, All Stirred Up, CSS Publishing, Lima, Ohio, 1997\u0014",

    "words": "The origins of the Advent wreath are found in the folk practices of \nthe\u0014\npre-Christian Germanic peoples who, during the cold December darkness \nof\u0014\nEastern Europe, gathered wreaths of evergreen and lighted fires as \nsigns of\u0014\nhope in a coming spring and renewed light.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Christians kept these popular traditions alive, and \nby the\u0014\n16th century Catholics and Protestants throughout Germany used these \nsymbols to celebrate their Advent hope in Christ, the everlasting \nLight. From\u0014\nGermany the use of the Advent wreath spread to other parts of the \nChristian\u0014\nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Traditionally, the wreath is made of four candles in \na\u0014\ncircle of evergreens. Three candles are violet and the fourth is \nrose, but\u0014\nfour white candles or four violet candles can also be used. Each day \nat\u0014\nhome, the candles are lighted, perhaps before the evening meal-- one \ncandle\u0014\nthe first week, and then another each succeeding week until December \n25th. A\u0014\nshort prayer may accompany the lighting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Advent season is a time to prepare for the birth of  Our Lord. We \nopen\u0014\nthis season with expressions of yearning and confidence which is \nrepeated\u0014\neach week of Advent until Christmas Day.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The establishment of God's Kingdom, which was \nforetold by\u0014\nthe prophets is about to be inaugurated in this world by the coming \nof Our\u0014\nSavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Each year the Church prepares us by a renewal of \nChristian\u0014\nlife to celebrate with joy and confidence the birth of Him who came \nto save\u0014\nour souls from sin, transform our lives by His grace, and lead us to \nheaven\u0014\nand the Kingdom of His glory.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  At Christmas, Jesus will be born in our hearts, for \nat\u0014\nthat time the anniversary of His birth will be celebrated. He refuses\u0014\nnothing, to the prayers of the Church, His spouse, and He will grant \nto our\u0014\nsouls the same graces which He gave the shepards and the Wise Kings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The whole of today's Mass is a preparation for the \ndouble\u0014\nAdvent of mercy and justice.\u0014\n\u0014\n===============\u0014\nGaudete (Rejoice) Sunday begins this week of Advent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christmas nears, the Third Sunday of Advent lays special emphasis \non the\u0014\njoy which should be in our hearts as we comtemplate the great mystery \nof our\u0014\nSavior's birth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The whole of today's liturgy is filled with the joy \nof the\u0014\nseason. At Mass the vestments are rose, the flowers on the altar, the \nplaying of the organ at Mass, are all indications that the joyous \natmosphere of the\u0014\nChristmas celebration is upon us.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the same way that St John the Baptist prepared \nthe Jews\u0014\nfor the coming of the Messiah, so he prepares us for the union which \nour\u0014\nLord forms with our souls at Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Make straight the way of the Lord\" said St. John \nthe\u0014\nBaptist.

As \nhe reflected\u0014\n                      despondently on this one day in a cave on Mount \nHira (in A.D.\u0014\n                      609 or 610), Muhammad said, the angel Gabriel \nappeared to\u0014\n                      him: \"Recite: In the Name of thy Lord who \ncreated Man of a\u0014\n                      blood-clot. Recite: And thy Lord is the Most \nGenerous, who\u0014\n                      taught by the pen, taught Man that he knew not\" \n(Surah\u0014\n                      96:1-4). The injunction to \"recite\" meant \"make \nvocal what is\u0014\n                      already written,\" says Islamicist Kenneth \nCragg, which means it\u0014\n                      was the \"sending down\" of a preexistent book. \n(Qur'an is\u0014\n                      Arabic for \"recitation.\")\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At first Muhammad feared he had been overtaken \nby a jinn, a\u0014\n                      troubling spirit. But Muhammad's wife Khadijah \nencouraged him\u0014\n                      that his visions were indeed from God and that \nhe had been\u0014\n                      chosen as his special messenger. Muhammad's \nfear gave way\u0014\n                      to acquiescence and the visions recurred with \ngreater\u0014\n                      frequency.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      His recitations denounced idol worship and \nproclaimed the total\u0014\n                      sovereignty of the One True God. Because the \nPeople of the\u0014\n                      Book also claimed allegiance to this God, his \nearly recitations\u0014\n                      about Christianity and Judaism in the Qur'an \nwere irenic: \"O\u0014\n                      believers, be you God's helpers, as Jesus, \nMary's son, said to\u0014\n                      the Apostles. 'Who will be my helpers unto \nGod?' The Apostles\u0014\n                      said, 'We will be helpers of God' \" (Surah \n61:14).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      His small circle of followers, composed mostly \nof family\u0014\n                      members and domestic help, became increasingly \nassertive in\u0014\n                      their belief that Muhammad was a prophet, and \nthis aroused\u0014\n                      the consternation of the people of Mecca, many \nof whom felt\u0014\n                      their vested interests in idol worship and \ncommerce were\u0014\n                      threatened.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The deaths of his beloved wife Khadijah (15 \nyears his senior)\u0014\n                      and his uncle Abu Talib (who also served as a \nprotector) in\u0014\n                      619 precipitated a crisis for Muhammad. He and \nhis followers\u0014\n                      could stay in Mecca in perpetual jeopardy as a \ndespised\u0014\n                      minority, or he could move to a new location \nwhere the\u0014\n                      fledgling faith could gain a foothold and grow. \nSome of his\u0014\n                      disciples had succeeded in their missionary \nundertakings to\u0014\n                      the north, in a place called Yathrib, later \ncalled Medina. So in\u0014\n                      622, Muhammad migrated to that city to form a \nnew base of\u0014\n                      activity. The famous hijrah (emigration) \noccurred in September\u0014\n                      of that year and became the historical fulcrum \nof Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Several things happened with this move that \nsolidified and\u0014\n                      redefined Islam. First, despite the previous \nmissionary\u0014\n                      successes in Medina, Muhammad's new religion \nhardly\u0014\n                      received unanimous affirmation upon his \narrival. Some resisted\u0014\n                      his presumption and others eschewed the notion \nof converting.\u0014\n                      Second, Muhammad had anticipated a warm \nreception from the\u0014\n                      People of the Bookprimarily the Jewsin \nMedina, since they\u0014\n                      too were \"Scripture people.\" Instead they \ntreated him with\u0014\n                      \"amused disdain,\" says Cragg, and rejected his \nclaims as\u0014\n                      \"pretentious.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      These difficulties triggered a shift in \nMuhammad's message.\u0014\n                      The portions of the Qur'an \"sent down\" during \nthis period took\u0014\n                      on a more aggressive political and legal tone, \nin contrast to its\u0014\n                      previous poetic and mystical reflections. \nDuring the Medinan\u0014\n                      years (622-630) Muhammad consolidated Islam \ninto a\u0014\n                      functioning, overarching political and \nreligious communitythe\u0014\n                      ummaand built a mosque. He also fashioned his \nrevelations\u0014\n                      into principles, and administered the social, \npolitical, economic,\u0014\n                      and religious affairs of the Medinans. \nRecitations regarding the\u0014\n                      People of the Book (both Jews and Christians) \nbecame more\u0014\n                      belligerent: \"God fight them, what liars they \nare\" (Surah 9:30);\u0014\n                      and \"O believers, take not Jews and Christians \nas friends; they\u0014\n                      are friends of each other. Whoso of you makes \nthem his\u0014\n                      friends is one of them. God guides not the \npeople of the\u0014\n                      evildoers\" (Surah 5:56).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the same time, hostilities with the Meccans \ncontinued as\u0014\n                      Muhammad raided their caravans traveling north. \nThe Battle of\u0014\n                      Badr (624) proved decisive for establishing \nIslam as an\u0014\n                      aggressive force. \"[T]he sword was unleashed \nand the\u0014\n                      scabbard cast away. The jihad, or appeal to \nbattle, had been\u0014\n                      irrevocably invoked,\" Cragg says. (Jihad also \nhas a spiritual\u0014\n                      sense in Islam: the struggle of the self \nagainst veering from the\u0014\n                      truth.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A contentious debate continues today in Muslim \ncircles about\u0014\n                      whether this aggression should be considered \n\"defensive,\"\u0014\n                      since the future of Islam was at stake. The \nQur'an maintains\u0014\n                      that war is an evil, but the extinction of \nIslam is a greater evil\u0014\n                      (Surah 2:217). But for all intents and \npurposes, the victory at\u0014\n                      Badr marked a critical stage in the evolution \nof Islam from a\u0014\n                      defensive to an offensive position.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By 630 Muhammad returned to Mecca in victory. \nHe claimed\u0014\n                      the city for Islam and destroyed the idols \nbeing worshiped at\u0014\n                      the Ka'bah. This action introduced the notion \nof \"manifest\u0014\n                      success\"geographical dominanceas a validating \nsign of\u0014\n                      Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Muhammad \"combined the good and the bad \nqualities of an\u0014\n                      Oriental chief,\" notes Christian historian \nPhilip Schaff. He\u0014\n                      despised ostentation and lived in small \nmud-brick cottages with\u0014\n                      his many wives. He mended his own clothes, \ncobbled his\u0014\n                      shoes, milked goats, and was accessible, \ngracious, and\u0014\n                      hospitable to visitors. Muhammad died in 632, \ntwo years after\u0014\n                      the conquest of Mecca. The recitations were \ncompletethe\u0014\n                      canon, so to speak, was closed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Qur'an. The Qur'an to the Muslim is not \nwhat the Bible is\u0014\n                      to the Christian. Rather, the Qur'an is to the \nMuslim what Jesus\u0014\n                      is to the Christian. Jesus is the Word made \nflesh and the\u0014\n                      Qur'an, for the Muslim, is the Word made text. \nThe Book\u0014\n                      preexisted in heaven before Muhammad received \nthe\u0014\n                      command to recite and he simply brought into \nphysical being\u0014\n                      what already existed in completeness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      To borrow Christian vocabulary, one might say \nhe incarnated\u0014\n                      the Book. Muhammad was illiterate, according to \nIslamic\u0014\n                      tradition, ensuring the purity of the \nrevelation (though some,\u0014\n                      including Cragg, dispute that view).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When the recitations ended with Muhammad's \ndeath in 632,\u0014\n                      points in the Qur'an required further \nclarification for long-term\u0014\n                      communal guidance. This clarification gave rise \nto Tradition\u0014\n                      (hadith sharif): the collected sayings, \nthoughts, and deeds of\u0014\n                      Muhammad. Muslims looked to how Muhammad lived \nfor\u0014\n                      guidance in practical living. For example, \nAl-Ghazalian\u0014\n                      eleventh-century Muslim legal scholar and \nequivalent of\u0014\n                      Thomas Aquinaswrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Know that the key of happiness \nisimitating God's\u0014\n                           Apostle in all his goings out and comings \nin, in his\u0014\n                           movements and times of quiescence, even in \nthe\u0014\n                           manner of his eating, his deportment, his \nsleep\u0014\n                           and his speech. So you must sit while \nputting on\u0014\n                           trousers and stand while putting on a \nturban: You\u0014\n                           must begin with the right foot when \nputting on your\u0014\n                           sandals, and eat with your right hand: When\u0014\n                           cutting your nails you must begin with the\u0014\n                           forefinger of the right hand and finish \nwith the\u0014\n                           thumb: in the foot you must begin with the \nlittle toe\u0014\n                           of the right foot and finish with the \nlittle toe of the\u0014\n                           left.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"God does not speak in a vacuum,\" says Dr. \nMahmoud Ayoub,\u0014\n                      a Muslim and professor of Islamic studies and \ncomparative\u0014\n                      religion at Temple University. \"God speaks to \npeople in their\u0014\n                      own situation. So there is a human dimension of \nthe Qur'an.\"\u0014\n                      Even so, Muslims do not regard the Qur'an as a \nhistorical\u0014\n                      document to be reinterpreted in new contexts \nand eras. \"It's a\u0014\n                      miracle of speech,\" Ayoub says. \"But we cannot \napply the\u0014\n                      principles of biblical criticism to the Qur'an. \nThere is no\u0014\n                      evolution of the text.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR FAITH\u0014\n                      This notion of an immutable text has been put \nto the test as\u0014\n                      Islam has moved West. An example of how the \nQur'an has\u0014\n                      collided with Western sensibilities is in its \nstatements about\u0014\n                      women.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Muhammad's time, women's roles were notably \ninferior to\u0014\n                      men's. One of the most difficult verses reads: \n\"Righteous\u0014\n                      women are therefore obedient, guarding the \nsecret for God's\u0014\n                      guarding. And those you fear may be rebellious \nadmonish;\u0014\n                      banish them to their couches, and beat them\" \n(Surah 4:34). In\u0014\n                      matters of inheritance, women are to receive \nhalf of what men\u0014\n                      receive (Surah 4:11). Men are the \"managers\" of \nwomen\u0014\n                      (Surah 4:35) and can \"come unto [their] tillage \nas they wish\"\u0014\n                      (sexually) (Surah 2:223); can divorce their \nwives by stating \"I\u0014\n                      divorce you\" three times (2:229-230); and may \ntake more than\u0014\n                      one wife (4:29).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"What is happening now is that a lot of Islamic \nscholars are\u0014\n                      trying to extricate Islam from that culture,\" \nsays Jane Smith,\u0014\n                      professor of Islamic studies at Hartford \nSeminary in\u0014\n                      Connecticut and author of Islam in America. \n\"Many are\u0014\n                      increasingly saying we must look to the \nparticular time and to\u0014\n                      the particular context.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many feminist scholars look to Muhammad's \nexamplehe\u0014\n                      affirmed and empowered womenas a means of \ninterpreting\u0014\n                      these troubling passages. From this vantage, \nmany see these\u0014\n                      verses as strangely empowering for women. \nInheritance, these\u0014\n                      scholars argue, is not earned and so is not a \nright. Given that\u0014\n                      men are responsible for the well-being of the \nfamilies and\u0014\n                      women are not, that they receive anything at \nall is a reflection\u0014\n                      of their esteemed status. The division of \nroles, wherein men\u0014\n                      \"manage\" the affairs of women, is actually \nliberating. One\u0014\n                      noted feminist scholar, a western convert to \nIslam, says that\u0014\n                      this arrangement \"accords with the God-given \nnatures of men\u0014\n                      and women.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The surahs (chapters) regarding polygamy and \ndivorce are\u0014\n                      trickier, but also not without merit, some \nwould argue. Many\u0014\n                      contemporary Muslim scholars say polygamy \nensures that men\u0014\n                      will not take on mistresses and bear \nillegitimate children, and\u0014\n                      grants these other women legal protection. A \nwoman without a\u0014\n                      husband in a Muslim community is in an insecure \nposition, and\u0014\n                      since there are usually more women than men, \npolygamy\u0014\n                      ensures companionship to them all. \"To share a \nhusband is\u0014\n                      better than having none,\" Napoleon John writes \nin Partners or\u0014\n                      Prisoners, citing Hammudah Abdalati, author of \nIslam in Focus.\u0014\n                      \"If [the husband] is bound to be monogamous, \nthis may lead to\u0014\n                      hypocrisy, adultery, illegitimacy, abortion, \nand many other\u0014\n                      troubles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The triple pronouncement of divorce offers the \nneeded\u0014\n                      restraints to prevent a proclamation in a \nheated moment. The\u0014\n                      same principle applies to the stages of \ndiscipline before a\u0014\n                      beating. A verbal reprimand must precede a \nwife's being\u0014\n                      banished from her husband's bed, which must \nprecede being\u0014\n                      beaten. In other words, beating is a last \nresort. Both Jane\u0014\n                      Smith and The New York Times Book Review (in \nreviewing\u0014\n                      Smith's Islam in America) are surprisingly \nuncritical of such\u0014\n                      interpretations, given the outrage the Southern \nBaptists'\u0014\n                      \"submission statement\" elicited. \"[N]o \nreputable Muslim\u0014\n                      interpreters would suggest it should involve \nanything more than\u0014\n                      the lightest of taps as a reminder to the wife \nof conjugal\u0014\n                      responsibilities,\" Smith writes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are many happy Muslim marriages and \nloving husbands\u0014\n                      who do not beat their wives. But this \ndiscussion highlights the\u0014\n                      difficulties Muslims encounter in bringing \ntheir view of the\u0014\n                      Qur'an to the West.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many women view marriage the same way Muslims \nview their\u0014\n                      relationship with God, says \"Kaye,\" an American \nmissionary in\u0014\n                      a Muslim country who does not want to be \nidentified.

    "title": "OUTPACED BY ISLAM?",
    "words": "Outpaced by Islam?\u0014\nThe Muslim challenge is growing faster than our Christian outreach.\u0014\nA Christianity Today Editorial | posted 02/04/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nIn our postSeptember 11 world, one of the most important \ncontributions Christians can make is respectful and courageous \noutreach to Muslims. We should seek them out both in the Islamic \nworld and here at home, where, by conservative estimates, Muslims \nnumber about 2 million.\u0014\nOne hundred years after Samuel Zwemer, the renowned \"apostle to \nIslam,\" began his work in Arabia, Christian outreach to Muslims has \nbeen dwarfed by the growth of Islam. During the 20th century, the \nglobal population of Muslims grew to 21 percent from 12.3 percent in \n1900. Yet only 6 percent of all Christian foreign missionaries are \nworking among Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Mission Handbook statistics, American Protestants do not \nexpend a large amount of their ministry resources in Muslim-majority \nnations. Compare American Protestant outreach in two nations: Brazil \nwith 170 million people and Pakistan with 150 million. In \nChristian-majority Brazil, more than 100 American Protestant missions \nagencies support 1,488 workers. In Muslim-majority Pakistan, there \nare 24 agencies with 111 American workers. There are many reasons why \nAmerican agencies devote less time and energy in Muslim nations, \nincluding the reality that many Muslim nations are closed to missions \norganizations and do not embrace true freedom of religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe closed nature of most Islamic nations stands in stark contrast to \nthe openness of Western ones. This openness is rooted in the gospel: \nGod's love, Christ's sacrifice, the equal worth of individuals, the \nlimited authority of political institutions, and the gradual but \nthorough liberation of women, slaves, and others. Where the gospel \nhas flowered, it has been good for society.\u0014\n\u0014\nClosed societies, on the other hand, deprive individuals of civil \nrights and suppress peaceful change. Among many contemporary \nexamples, the arrest and torture of Mohammed Saeed Mohammed Omer in \nSudan stands out. Omer became a Christian as a student in India. \nAfter his family in Sudan found out, he was forced to return home and \nreceived a death threat from his uncle. While in police custody, Omer \n\"was tortured and beaten and he lost three fingernails pulled out \nwith pliers,\" a source told Compass Direct news service.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Ministry of Friendship'\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the lasting legacies of Zwemer's work in the Middle East is \nhis strategy\"ministry of friendship\"for outreach to Muslims. Yet \neven friendship evangelism paired with relief work may be costly. One \nhigh-profile example is the apparent entrapment of Shelter Now \nworkers Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer. The two Americans showed the \nJesus film to a seemingly friendly family of Afghan Muslims at their \nrequest. Immediately afterward, Taliban police arrested the two women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new regime in Afghanistan has welcomed relief and development \nagencies back into their nation. This development is a sure sign that \ncompassionate provision of food, housing, education, and medical care \nis free of roadblocks to Christians. But there is more for American \nChristians to do. Acknowledging our need for contrition and \nrepentance is a good place to start. A 1978 Lausanne report on Muslim \nevangelism noted the tragic lack of progress in Muslim outreach: \"We \nChristians have loved so little and have put forth such little effort \nto regard Muslims as people like ourselves.\" More recently, \nFrontiers, AIMS (Accelerating International Mission Strategies), and \nother Muslim-focused missions issued a declaration of \"Christian \nAttitudes Toward Muslims,\" which says in part, \"We are guilty of \nbelieving and perpetuating misconceptions, prejudice, and, in some \ncases, hostility and outright hatred toward Muslim peoples.\" But this \nstatement also declares, \"Reconciliation is the goal of our \nrepentance\" and sets out an agenda of prayer, compassion, and \ninteraction with Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Untapped Force\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Roberts, previously in charge of Interfaith Witness for the \nSouthern Baptist Convention and now head of Midwestern Baptist \nSeminary, has developed a ten-point program for respectful religious \ndialogue and witnessing to Muslims. He emphasized the need for \nAmerican Christians to understand the Qur'an and \"to become a friend \nand a personal evangelist to Muslims.\"\u0014\nHis plan rests on several important realizations:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMuslims rarely hear a truthful presentation of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFew U.S. Christians understand essential Islamic teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tEvangelistic outreach should be defined in terms of relationships, \nnot transactions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Christians have an additional valuable resource in outreach \nto Muslims. Looking at overseas outreach to Muslims, the 1978 \nLausanne report says, \"The major untapped force for evangelism among \nMuslims is the Christian community scattered throughout the Muslim \nworld.\" Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Sudanall have such \nchurches, some of them growing faster than the surrounding Muslim \npopulation. Given appropriate support, these national churches are \nwell positioned to aid in outreach.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals in Muslim-controlled Malaysia provide an encouraging \nexample of Christian-Muslim interaction. Last year, for instance, \nMalaysian President Mahathir Mohammed delivered a keynote address to \nan international meeting of evangelicals. \"Our experience in Malaysia \nis that we have to be tolerant with each other,\" he said in later \nremarks about religious harmony. \"Otherwise we are going to fight \neach other and we are not going to get anything out of it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder this umbrella of mutual tolerance, Christians have planted new \nchurches as well as expanded their outreach. It takes Christians \nworking on both sides of a closed door to get it open.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christianity Today.\u0014\nFebruary 4, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 2, Page 26\u0014",

    "title": "OBJECTIONS TO THE 2000 \"FAITH AND MESSAGE\"",
    "words": "Objections to the 2000 \nBaptist Faith & Message\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible vs. Jesus\u0014\nThe most unconscionable change in the 2000 BF&M is its promotion of \nthe Bible at the expense of Jesus. In 1963, the Bible was described \nas the record of Gods self-revelation. God was understood to have \nsupremely revealed himself by incarnation in Jesus. The Lordship of \nChrist over the process by which every believer interprets scripture \nwas acknowledged by the affirmation that, The criterion by which the \nBible is to be interpreted is Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2000, the description of the Bible as a record of Gods \nrevelation has been deleted. The affirmation that Christ is the \ncriterion by which the Bible is to be interpreted has also been \nremoved. Jesus has been demoted and the Bible has been promoted. Now \nthe Bible is understood to be the supreme revelation of God and \nChrist is merely the focus of divine revelation. The Lordship of \nChrist over the process by which believers interpret the Bible for \nthemselves has been replaced by a process in which believers adhere \nto the interpretations provided for them by the 2000 BF&M.\u0014\n\u0014\nHierarchy vs. Autonomy\u0014\nHistorically Baptists have stood in the free church tradition. We \nhave understood churches to be autonomous and free from \necclesiastical control. Decisions about who the congregation called \nas pastor and/or ordained as deacons was determined by how the \ncongregation felt led by the Holy Spirit.\u0014\nThe 2000 BF&M decrees that the office of pastor is limited to men \nand ignores the biblical examples of God calling women to lead men in \nworship and service (Ex. 15:20; Judges 4; 2 Kings 22:14, Micah 6:4; \nJoel 2:28-29; Luke 2:26-28; Acts 2:16-21; Acts 18; Acts 21:9; 1 Cor. \n11:5; Rom. 16:1,7). There can be no doubt that the 2000 BF&M has been \ndesigned to authorize the hierarchical exercise of ecclesiastical \ncontrol over those churches that feel led by the Holy Spirit to call \nwomen as their pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nHusbands vs. Wives\u0014\nThe 2000 BF&M advises only wives that they must graciously submit \nto their husbands and neglects to tell husbands that they must submit \nwith as much or more grace than their wives. The 2000 BF&Ms \ninterpretation of Eph. 5:22 ignores the grammatical (in the Greek) \nand logical priority that must be given to the command to mutual \nsubmission in (Eph. 5:21). It makes the husband lord of the wife \nrather than acknowledging that Christ is Lord over both. Adding to \nthese errors is the view that the metaphor head (Eph. 5:23) should \nbe seen as an image of a proud and powerful military ruler rather \nthan as an image of a self-sacrificing and humble suffering servant \nwho voluntarily sets aside power and glory and gives his life for his \nfamily (Phil. 2:3-8).\u0014\n\u0014\nCreedalism\u0014\nEarly Baptists were opposed to anything that emboldens people to \njudge the liberty of other mens consciences. Sentiment against \ncreeds was so strong in 1845 that the Baptists who founded the \nSouthern Baptist Convention refused to write a statement of beliefs. \nThey would follow no creed, but the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo allay fears about the danger of creedalism, when in 1925 the SBC \nadopted the first Baptist Faith & Message (BF&M) statement, its \nnon-binding character was made clear by the assertion that it has no \nauthority over conscience. Later, in the 1963 revision, an explicit \nstatement was added declaring that BF&M statements were not official \ncreeds carrying mandatory authority. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe revisers of the 2000 BF&M deleted the 1963 statement denying that \nthe BF&M carries mandatory authority and replaced it with the \nassertion that BF&Ms are instruments of doctrinal accountability. \n(See Preambles)\u0014",

He\u0014\n                 wasn't charged with murder because he was not at the \nscene when the\u0014\n                 attack occurred. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Prosecutors contend that Knoller and Noel knew that \nthe two giant Presa\u0014\n                 Canario dogs they kept, Bane and Hera, were \ndangerous. They also\u0014\n                 alleged that Knoller didn't try to stop the attack \nand didn't come to\u0014\n                 Whipple's assistance as the college lacrosse coach \nlay dying in the hallway\u0014\n                 of apartment building. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In his cross-examination, Hammer also peppered \nKnoller with questions\u0014\n                 about testimony from other witnesses who related \nincidents where the dogs\u0014\n                 were aggressive. She frequently responded by saying \nshe wasn't present\u0014\n                 or didn't recall the incidents, or said that the \nwitnesses were wrong about\u0014\n                 what took place. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 He also asked her about a letter she wrote to a\u0014\n                 prison inmate befriended by the couple, in which\u0014\n                 she wrote that she didn't \"have the body weight\u0014\n                 or leverage\" to control Bane. In the course of\u0014\n                 that exchange, Knoller conceded that \"Bane had\u0014\n                 some dog aggression issues.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 However, Knoller said that she felt those issues\u0014\n                 involved him going after other dogs, not\u0014\n                 attacking people. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Earlier, in a second day of sometimes tearful direct \ntestimony, Knoller said\u0014\n                 she tried to stem Whipple's bleeding after the \nattack -- but stopped\u0014\n                 because she believed she needed to get Bane away \nfrom the wounded\u0014\n                 woman. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"I was holding on for dear life to make sure he \ndidn't go back to doing what\u0014\n                 he was doing,\" Knoller said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The defense also called to the stand a trauma expert \nwho testified that\u0014\n                 Knoller suffered dog bites similar to Whipple's \nwounds during the incident --\u0014\n                 evidence to support the defense contention that \nKnoller tried to intervene\u0014\n                 after the dog attacked Whipple. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 On the stand Monday, Knoller said that she had tried \nto stop the attack,\u0014\n                 even using her own body to try to protect Whipple. \nOn Tuesday, testifying\u0014\n                 about the aftermath of the attack, Knoller said she \nput two fingers in a\u0014\n                 wound in Whipple's neck to stop the bleeding. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But she testified that she took her fingers out of \nthe wound because,\u0014\n                 fearing Bane might resume the attack, she decided \nshe needed to move\u0014\n                 Bane and Hera into her apartment. She also said \nWhipple was breathing\u0014\n                 and that she was \"pretty sure\" she still had a \npulse. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 After putting the dogs in her apartment, Knoller \ntestified that she went back\u0014\n                 into the hallway and was looking for her keys when \nshe encountered police\u0014\n                 officers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 A neighbor, not Knoller, had called 911 for help. On \ncross-examination,\u0014\n                 Hammer disputed Knoller's assertion that the \nneighbor, an elderly woman,\u0014\n                 had told Knoller that she already called for help. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"You made it up,\" Hammer said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"No, I didn't,\" Knoller responded. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Knoller said that before the attack she\u0014\n                 had \"no idea\" that Bane was capable of\u0014\n                 such violence and therefore doesn't\u0014\n                 feel responsible for the attack. She\u0014\n                 agreed to turn the dogs over to animal\u0014\n                 control officers because, after what she\u0014\n                 saw Bane do to Whipple, \"I didn't want\u0014\n                 to deal with a beast like that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Bane was put down, but the couple\u0014\n                 later fought efforts by officials to\u0014\n                 destroy Hera. Under cross-examination,\u0014\n                 Knoller told Hammer that Hera wasn't\u0014\n                 involved in the attack, as prosecutors\u0014\n                 contend, and \"I didn't want Hera to be put down for \nsomething she didn't\u0014\n                 do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Both dogs were eventually destroyed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Knoller also said Tuesday on direct examination that \nshe \"never\" believed\u0014\n                 Whipple was responsible for the attack, even though \nshe testified\u0014\n                 previously that Bane bit Whipple on the neck after \nWhipple struck Knoller in\u0014\n                 the eye during the struggle with the dogs -- and \nthat she warned Whipple\u0014\n                 that her dog was only being protective. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 However, under cross-examination, Knoller said \nWhipple tried to get out\u0014\n                 from under her after she threw herself on Whipple to \nstop the attack.\u0014\n                 \"That's when things escalated,\" Knoller said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In other testimony Tuesday, a defense expert on \ntrauma, Dr. David Barcay\u0014\n                 of Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, said he \nexamined photographs of\u0014\n                 Knoller, taken after the mauling, and compared them \nto two photos of\u0014\n                 Whipple. He said Knoller had bruises on her wrists, \nbreast and shoulder, as\u0014\n                 well as puncture wounds on her fingers, that \nappeared to be consistent with\u0014\n                 bites inflicted on Whipple. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Under cross-examination, Barcay was shown 18 more \nphotographs of\u0014\n                 Whipple showing that she had bites from her forehead \nto her ankles. The\u0014\n                 doctor said he could not offer an explanation as to \nwhy Whipple had\u0014\n                 suffered so many more bites than Knoller during \nBane's frenzied attack. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The trial of Knoller and Noel was moved from San \nFrancisco to Los Angeles\u0014\n                 because of the extensive publicity the case received \nin the Bay Area. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 -- CNN Correspondent Thelma Gutierrez contributed to \nthis report.\u0014",

Walter M. Jeffords' Firethorn, \nclosest to Omaha in the Preakness, Foxcatcher Farm Stable's Rosemont, \nvictor over the Belair star in the  one-mile Withers Stakes, and \nAlfred Vanderbilt's Cold Shoulder, fresh from a workout over the\u0014\nBelmont distance in 2:29 2/5, were the only colts whose owners still \nretained hopes of downing\u0014\nWilliam Woodward's fine racer. The remaining starter, Sir Beverley, \nis a stablemate of Omaha.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The small field gave Starter George Cassidy little \ntrouble, and was away quickly. Willie Saunders,  who was beaten on \nOmaha in his last previous start, profited by the experience and \nsteered for  the rail, saving every possible inch around the first \nturn. Cold Shoulder was indulged with the lead,  and soon had opened \na sizable gap, with Firethorn in second place. Omaha was next, \nRosemont  fourth. Sir Beverley, after a half-mile, was simply not in \nthe race. The order was not changed until the field had gone nearly a \nhalf-mile. Cold Shoulder had widened his advantage to five lengths, \nand  had not begun to shorten stride.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Those who remembered the Vanderbilt colt's fine \nworkout began to believe that the Display colt  might hold his lead. \nNo such fear affected Saunders on the Gallant Fox colt, or Raymond \nWorkman\u0014\non Firethorn. Each was watching the other, careless of how far Cold \nShoulder stole into the lead.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  After seven furlongs Rosemont sprinted past both of \nthem, but neither moved to repulse the\u0014\nFoxcatcher colt. Then, with a half-mile to go, Workman asked \nFirethorn the question, and the Sun  Briar colt began moving swiftly \nforward on the inside. Immediately Saunders swung his bat on Omaha, \nand the Belair crack lengthened stride. The leaders were picked up \nwithout the formality of a challenge, and Firethorn entered the \nstretch in first place, Omaha at his throat-latch.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  A  determined struggle in the stretch carried the \nleaders far out from the rest of the field. Fifty yards  from the \nfinish Omaha had taken the lead, and he drew out to win with a \nhalf-length of daylight\u0014\nshowing over Firethorn. Rosemont was third, eight lengths behind the \nJeffords colt, a length in front of Cold Shoulder. Fifteen lengths \nfarther back came the winner's stablemate, Sir Beverley, eased up \nafter being outrun.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Amid hearty cheering, Saunders brought Omaha back \nto the winner's circle, the victory being the the most popular of the \nday. There, despite a driving rain, waited Omaha's owner, William\u0014\nWoodward, and the New York banker led in, for the second time in his \nTurf career, a horse which had won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and \nBelmont Stakes in his colors. The first, in 1930, was  Gallant Fox, \nsire of the present 3-year-old champion, now indisputably at the top \nof his division. \u0014\n        \u0014\n                 Omaha was the third horse to complete the triple, \nSir Barton having accomplished the feat in 1919,  and was the first \nto be sired by a horse which had won the three events.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Omaha's victory was worth $35,480, and brought his \ntotal earnings to $106,930, of which\u0014\n$103,080 has been won this year. In 15 starts he has won five races, \nfinished second five times,  third once. He has won four of his six \nstarts at three, finished once second, once third.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  (Afternote: Omaha met the great handicap star \nDiscovery in the Brooklyn two weeks after the\u0014\nBelmont and finished third behind him. Discovery went on to become \nHorse of the Year, stamping  Omaha as the only Triple Crown winner \nwho failed to earn the highest honors. Omaha raced as a 4-year-old in \nEngland, where his supreme effort came in a nose loss in the \nprestigious Ascot Gold\u0014\nCup at 2 1/2 miles. Omaha, who was returned to the U.S. to stand at \nstud, was buried near the\u0014\nentrance to Ak-Sar-Ben near Omaha, Neb. He ranks No. 61 on The \nBlood-Horse's Top 100\u0014\nRacehorses of the 20th Century.)\u0014",

    "words": "ONE SURE SIGN OF A LEADER\u0014\n                    by Alan Nelson, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   Some people have a great capacity to lead but have never\u0014\n   developed it. Others have less capacity but are maximizing\u0014\n   their potential in that area and, therefore, may be perceived\u0014\n   as stronger leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Many quality leaders are overlooked because of their youth or\u0014\n   because they've never been given an opportunity to truly lead.\u0014\n   As leaders, it's our responsibility to spot leaders and give\u0014\n   them those opportunities, but the ability to accurately\u0014\n   estimate leadership capacity is rarer than leading itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Moses didn't see himself as a natural leader, so he asked God\u0014\n   to provide a spokesperson (Aaron) when God wouldn't let him\u0014\n   off the hook. The priest who anointed young David as king\u0014\n   didn't see his capacity for leading at the start.\u0014\n\u0014\n   An equal but opposite challenge is to help a person understand\u0014\n   when he or she is not leader material.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Because of the misperceptions around the aura and joy of\u0014\n   leading, many are self-deceived wannabes who don't feel self-\u0014\n   worth unless considered a leader. While playing follow-the-\u0014\n   leader with my five-year-old son, he said, \"Dad, wait for me.\u0014\n   I'm the leader.\" That tone is common among adults who want to\u0014\n   lead but who lack the skills and/or capacity to lead to a\u0014\n   significant degree. \"You've never given me a chance\" is an\u0014\n   oft-heard excuse among those who think that leadership is some\u0014\n   sort of formal role or position.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Bible and history give us many examples of insecure\u0014\n   leaders who exterminated people they saw as threats. These\u0014\n   were likely well networked, ambitious people who found\u0014\n   themselves in positions of leadership but without the\u0014\n   capacity to fulfill the responsibilities.\u0014\n\u0014\n   WHAT TO LOOK FOR\u0014\n   Leaders with natural gifts intuitively seek conditions where\u0014\n   they can express their leading, or they may find themselves in\u0014\n   roles where people thrust leading responsibilities on them. In\u0014\n   some ways, leaders cannot not lead.\u0014\n\u0014\n   As they participate in groups, people quickly perceive their\u0014\n   leading abilities. That's why leaders who don't want to get\u0014\n   involved sometimes stay along the fringes. While others see\u0014\n   them as aloof or uncommitted, these people have discovered\u0014\n   that when they participate as followers, peers recognize their\u0014\n   leader gifts and often push them into positions they don't\u0014\n   desire. People begin seeking their advice instead of talking\u0014\n   to the \"real\" leader. And the official leader perceives these\u0014\n   natural leaders as a threat.\u0014\n\u0014\n   One of the best measures of leader aptitude may surprise you.\u0014\n   Many people look at the sheer size of the organization that a\u0014\n   leader oversees, assuming this is a good measure of capacity.\u0014\n   While this can be a factor to consider, some people with\u0014\n   mediocre leadership gifts can manipulate their way into key\u0014\n   positions.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Political prowess, established networks, seniority, and\u0014\n   sometimes even luck help people find key roles where leading\u0014\n   is expected but which may not reflect their gifting. Never\u0014\n   assume that the person holding the CEO office space is wired\u0014\n   to lead. The better question is \"How did this person come to\u0014\n   this place?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   A more effective look at leadership ability is to analyze who\u0014\n   makes up the followers. The caliber of people on a team (even\u0014\n   an informal group) is often a better reflection of leadership\u0014\n   ability than the number of people on a team. When sharp,\u0014\n   talented people make up the constituency, chances are you have\u0014\n   a leader of leaders at the helm. Quality people and other\u0014\n   leaders rarely have the patience to follow someone lacking\u0014\n   leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Alan Nelson is pastor of Scottsdale Family Church and director\u0014\n   of the Southwest Center for Leadership. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Newsletter@LeadershipJournal.net\u0014",

Calling \nthemselves \"Christian Zionists,\"\u0014\n                      they are pouring millions of dollars into \nJewish relief efforts and other pro-Israel causes.\u0014\n                      At the same time, their motives are\u0014\n                      being called into question by some Jewish \nleaders uncomfortable with their \"end\u0014\n                      times\" theologyand concerned about the effect \nof this support on peace efforts in the\u0014\n                      Middle East. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Divine calling.\" One organization, the \nInternational Fellowship of Christians and\u0014\n                      Jews, has raised over $60 million for Jewish \nimmigration and relief efforts in Israel\u0014\n                      during the past eight yearsmost of it coming \nfrom some 250,000 evangelical Christian\u0014\n                      donors. Another group, Christians for \nIsrael/USA, says it has raised funds to help\u0014\n                      more than 65,000 Jews from the former Soviet \nUnion and elsewhere immigrate to\u0014\n                      Israel since 1991. In doing so, says the Rev. \nJames M. Hutchens, the group's president\u0014\n                      and a Presbyterian minister, \"we believe we are \nfulfilling a divine calling . . . to assist\u0014\n                      the Jewish people in their physical return and \nrestoration of the land of Israel.\"\u0014\n                      (Jewish groups and the Israeli government \nalready spend millions of dollars each year\u0014\n                      to help Jews resettle.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Christian right has also thrown its \nformidable political muscle behind Israel. Such\u0014\n                      luminaries of the religious right as Pat \nRobertson and Jerry Falwell and political\u0014\n                      activists Ralph Reed and Gary Bauer have become \noutspoken backers of the Israeli\u0014\n                      government. Two new national coalitions have \nbeen formed to rally political support\u0014\n                      for Israel among American evangelicalsan \nimportant constituency of the Bush\u0014\n                      administration and of Republicans in Congress. \nAnd earlier this year, the Israeli\u0014\n                      Embassy in Washington, D.C., began conducting \nmonthly briefings for evangelical\u0014\n                      leaders on the Middle East. \"The best friends \nIsrael has,\" says Hutchens of Christians\u0014\n                      for Israel/USA, \"are those of us whose theology \ncalls for the continued existence of\u0014\n                      the Jewish people in the land that is \nrightfully theirs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some Jews are not so sure. \"Once you get in bed \nwith them,\" says Robert O.\u0014\n                      Freedman, political science professor at \nBaltimore Hebrew University, \"you are, to a\u0014\n                      certain extent, subscribing to their view of \nwhat America ought to be. And that, in my\u0014\n                      view, is not in the best interests of the \nJewish people.\" Israel's hawkish friends may\u0014\n                      prove to be a hindrance by using their \ninfluence to block any land-for-peace\u0014\n                      agreements, some argue. And courting the \nreligious right could upset broader support\u0014\n                      for Israel in the United States. \"To associate \nIsrael with more extremist religious and\u0014\n                      political views,\" says Rabbi Eric Yoffie, \npresident of the Union of American Hebrew\u0014\n                      Congregations, \"may jeopardize the allegiance \nof mainstream Americans. That would\u0014\n                      be dangerous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, who founded the \nInternational Fellowship of Christians\u0014\n                      and Jews in 1983, argues that there is \"a major \ndistinction\" between the beliefs and\u0014\n                      the actions of evangelicals. \"If a Christian \nbelieves all people ultimately will come to\u0014\n                      believe in Jesus, that's one thing,\" he says. \n\"If they actively target Jews for\u0014\n                      conversion, that's another thing. We'll work \nwith the former, but not the latter.\" The\u0014\n                      evangelical backers, he says, \"are motivated by \ncompassion. It has nothing to do with\u0014\n                      the return of Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not optional. That's not what some of his \nsupporters say. \"We're seeing prophecy\u0014\n                      being fulfilled before our very eyes,\" says \nBishop Huey L. Harris, whose First\u0014\n                      Pentecostal Tabernacle, in Elkton, Md., donated \nsome $2,500 to the project, organized\u0014\n                      by Eckstein's group, that brought Noa Hirsch \nand the others to Israel. By helping Israel\u0014\n                      remain strong as a nation, Harris says, \"we're \nhelping prepare the way for Jesus to\u0014\n                      come back.\" Supporting Israel is not optional, \nadds the Rev. Lennie Allen, outreach\u0014\n                      pastor of the Hillcrest Church in Dallas, which \nhas channeled some $35,000 to\u0014\n                      Eckstein's group during the past decade. \"The \nBible says those who bless Israel will\u0014\n                      be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be \ncursed,\" says Allen. \"We stand with\u0014\n                      Israel because God has a predetermined plan for \nthat nation and for those people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Like Harris and Allen, many evangelicals view \nthe 1948 founding of Israel as the first\u0014\n                      in a chain of biblically mandated events that \nwill culminate in the return of Jesus and\u0014\n                      the end of historya scenario popularized in \nthe bestselling Left Behind fiction series.\u0014\n                      Part of that scenario, based on a hotly debated \ninterpretation of passages in\u0014\n                      Revelation, Daniel, and Ezekiel, involves a \ndevastating \"battle of Armageddon\"a\u0014\n                      nuclear holocaust that is stopped at its climax \nby the arrival of Jesus, who defeats the\u0014\n                      forces of evil and establishes an era of peace. \nBut millions of Jews are killed in the\u0014\n                      battle, and the survivors accept Jesus as their \nMessiah. Many Christians who\u0014\n                      subscribe to that view doubt the efficacy of \nMideast peace negotiations. \"There's only\u0014\n                      so much you can do diplomatically or \nmilitarily,\" says Hutchens of Christians for Israel.\u0014\n                      \"There will be no peace until the Messiah \ncomes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's an alarming idea to some. \"To what extent \nwill a theological view that calls for\u0014\n                      Armageddon in the Middle East lead \n[evangelicals] to support policies that may move in\u0014\n                      that direction, rather than toward stability \nand peaceful coexistence?\" asks Rabbi\u0014\n                      David Sap- erstein, director of the Religious \nAction Center of Reform Judaism. Adds\u0014\n                      Yoffie of the Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations: \"People who say there can\u0014\n                      be no peace are not really friends of Israel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not all evangelicals endorse the Left Behind \nscenario or the decidedly pro-Israeli\u0014\n                      posture it seeks to legitimize. Several dozen \nevangelical leaders recently signed a\u0014\n                      letter to President Bush urging an \"evenhanded \nU.S. policy\" toward Israelis and\u0014\n                      Palestinians. \"Significant numbers\" of \nevangelicals, they wrote, \"reject the way some\u0014\n                      have distorted biblical passages as their \nrationale for uncritical support\" of Israeli\u0014\n                      government actions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meanwhile, Noa Hirsch says she, for one, has no \nproblem with the evangelicals'\u0014\n                      religious beliefs. For now, she says, \"we share \nthe same goal: I want to be in Israel;\u0014\n                      they want me to be in Israel. I don't feel the \nleast guilty or uncomfortable accepting\u0014\n                      their help.\"\u0014",

    "words": "In March 1968, the US Army's Americal Division was on a \nsearch-and-destroy mission in a Viet Cong stronghold popularly called \n\"Pinkville.\" So far, the mission was a failure--mines and sniper fire \nwere killing American soldiers, but the enemy was nowhere to be \nfound. The day after an emotional memorial service, Lt. William \nCalley's platoon went looking for revenge in a nearby village called \nMy Lai. What happened next stigmatized every American soldier \nfighting in the Vietnam War, and the media overlooked one soldier's \ncourage.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalley ordered his men to gather the villagers--mostly women, \nchildren, and the elderly--into groups. No one resisted. Calley then \ngave the order to open fire. When some soldiers hesitated, Calley \ntook a weapon himself and fired. By the end of the day, somewhere \nbetween 175 and 400 Vietnamese were dead. Besides the mass killings, \nthere were individual murders by Calley and others, and at least one \ngang rape.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlying overhead, Americal Division helicopter pilot Warrant Officer \nHugh Thompson witnessed some of the killings. Seeing soldiers \napproaching a group of about 10 civilians, he landed in front of the \nsoldiers, then ordered his crew to cover him while he confronted the \nsoldiers and shepherded the civilians to safety. Later, he saw \nmovement in a pile of corpses, landed, and rescued a toddler.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe My Lai massacre tarnished the Army's image, helped divide public \nopinion about the war, and gave rise to the epithet \"babykiller\" that \nstung returning veterans. While reporters concentrated on Calley's \ntrial, conviction, and dishonor--which they perceived as emblematic \nof an out-of-control military--Thompson's heroism was reduced to a \nfootnote. Three decades later, however, the Army finally presented \nhim with the Soldier's Medal, its highest non-combat award. Out of \nthe Vietnam War's darkest moment, an ember of honor glowed.\u0014",

Mark J. Payton has quietly ascended the pulpit of St. \nGregory the Great, a once-unblemished parish now troubled over a \nfinancial audit that points to the grave of Payton's predecessor - \nthe late Monsignor William N. Novicky. \u0014\n\u0014\nPayton, an unassuming but cautious man, was longtime pastor of St. \nProcrop on Cleveland's West Side before assuming Novicky's post this \nsummer as pastor of one of the largest parishes in the Catholic \nDiocese of Cleveland. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis assignment took place amid rumors about the disappearance of at \nleast $1 million from parish coffers under Novicky's watch. But it \nwas not long before hot rumor was distilled into cold, hard fact. \u0014\n\u0014\nPayton is hoping results of an internal financial audit to be \nreleased early next month will end speculation about the \nunaccounted-for money, regain faith and support of parishioners, and \nlay the past to rest. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are pretty much wrapping that [audit] up,\" Payton said. \"I tell \npeople here we will be producing a financial report, and hopefully it \nwill answer some questions . . . that are probably unanswerable \nbecause the monsignor is dead.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPayton said while most parishioners are \"understanding people and are \nresponding very positively\" there are \"always a few who are a little \nskeptical. Once we are able to produce the financial report they will \nbe more understanding.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch rebuilding remains, he said, but he insists as long as everyone \nworks together, \"we will get things done and grow together as a \nparish church community.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nQuestions about parish finances arose during a mandatory audit that \ntakes place when a parish changes pastors, diocese spokesman Robert \nTayek said. The internal audit was launched a few weeks after \nNovicky's death in October. Then the FBI arrived. \u0014\n\"We asked them [FBI] to come in and take a look at certain matters, \nsaid Tayek, adding \"we have not had any feedback from them since.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTayek said officials went to the FBI rather than South Euclid Police \nbecause \"the case may have involved something more in their scope - I \ndon't know what that might be . . . but it would go beyond a local \njurisdiction.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe audit found St. Gregory was $250,000 in arrears with its \nassessment payments to the diocese and about $750,000 behind in \nbenefits to staff, Tayek said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"A million dollars is what we are looking at right now as far as \nthings that we know of for sure. The rest of it is being processed \nand scrutinized now,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nA business manager soon will be appointed for the first time to \noversee parish finances. Novicky had overseen St. Gregory's money \nmatters during his 25-year tenure as pastor. \u0014\n\u0014\nPayton is reluctant to talk about Novicky, a man whose final wish was \nto be buried in \"a gray, cardboard-like coffin\" used in the burials \nof indigents. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"None of us is perfect as human beings, even priests, as we all well \nknow from everything going on nowadays in the Catholic Church around \nthe country,\" he said. \"But every priest touches people in a special \nway and [has] different gifts and talents.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNovicky is remembered for a soothing voice - flowing from the pulpit \nor street corner for years, easing troubled souls with just the right \ntale, just the right tone. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a very engaging personality and told stories well,\" said \nAnette Gromada, Novicky's niece. \"He could bring people to where they \nneeded to be by using the art of storytelling . . . he did what he \ndid with determination and great passion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the veil of humility was a politically savvy clergyman with an \nacumen for business and an uncanny knack for finessing community \nleaders to support his prized projects. Those projects included the \nSt. Gregory Community Center and St. Andrews Towers, a subsidized \nhigh-rise apartment complex for low-income seniors in the mid-1970s. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a strong administrator from the business side and ran a \npretty tight ship,\" South Euclid Mayor John Kocevar said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNovicky had spearheaded education reform in Catholic schools and \nspoke passionately against homelessness and racism. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had served as superintendent of diocesan schools from 1969 to 1975 \nand previously supervised high school education for 19 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch members credited him with rejuvenating their parish and \nhelping residents get along in the racially integrating community. \nAnd he had a particular soft spot for the elderly and poor. \u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of what the audit and FBI probe reveal, Payton says, the \nparish will move on. And many people like Kocevar do not want to see \nthe image of a man he held in high regard damaged.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"There is some legacy there, and I'm sure that members would be \ndisappointed if any of that legacy was tarnished in any way,\" Kocevar \nsaid. \"I'm not expecting anything negative.\"\u0014",

Another legend exists, too, that \nMartin Luther, striding through the woods late one Christmas Eve, \nnoticed how exquisitely pure the starlight seemed when glimpsed \nthrough the trees, so he took home an evergreen as a remembrance of \nthat Christmas night and decorated it with candles to simulate the \nstars. Whatever the true story of the first Christmas tree, the \ncustom of decorating trees at Christmas arose in Germany. Today, \nthere is no more universal holiday decoration. The most popular carol \nabout the Christmas tree is this one from Germany, \"O Christmas \nTree,\" also known as \"O Tannenbaum.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging.\u0014\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging.\u0014\nNot only green when summer's here but also when 'tis cold and drear.\u0014\n\u0014\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging.\u0014\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, you fill all hearts with gaiety.\u0014\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, you fill all hearts with gaiety.\u0014\nOn Christmas Day, you stand so tall, affording joy to one and all.\u0014",

    "words": "John Francis Wade was an 18th-century British exile who moved to a \nRoman Catholic community in France, where he eked out an income by \ncopying and selling music and by giving music lessons to children. \nPerhaps he himself wrote the Latin stanzas, beginning \"Adeste \nfideles,\" which have made his name known; perhaps they were a text he \nwas called upon to translate. In any case, he combined the text with \na bit of music, probably by another Englishman, John Reading, and \npublished the resulting hymn around 1751. More than a century later, \nthe English version, \"O Come, All Ye Faithful,\" was turned out by \nFrederick Oakeley, a British clergyman who felt that if congregations \nhad good literary texts to sing, they would sing well. This hymn \nproved his point.\u0014\n\u0014\nO come, all ye faithful,\u0014\nJoyful and triumphant,\u0014\nO come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem\u0014\nCome and behold Him, born the King of Angels.\u0014\n\u0014\nCHORUS\u0014\nO come, let us adore Him,\u0014\nO come, let us adore Him,\u0014\nO come, let us adore Him,\u0014\nChrist, the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nSing, choirs of angels,\u0014\nSing in exultation;\u0014\nSing all ye citizens of heav'n above:\u0014\nGlory to God in the Highest.\u0014\n\u0014\nCHORUS\u0014\n\u0014\nYea, Lord, we greet Thee.\u0014\nBorn this happy morning;\u0014\nJesus, to Thee be glory giv'n Word of the Father, now in flesh \nappearing.\u0014\n\u0014\nCHORUS\u0014\n\u0014\nAdeste fideles,\u0014\nLaeti trimphantes,\u0014\nVenite, venite in Bethlehem.\u0014\nNatum videte, Regem angelorum.\u0014\nVenite adoremus;\u0014\nVenite adoremus;\u0014\nVenite adoremus, Dominum.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnglish words by Frederick Oakeley, Latin words attributed to John \nFrancis Wade, music by John Reading\u0014",

They believe their work may help to explain \nmysterious incidents when people report experiences of 'leaving' \ntheir body and watching it from above. \u0014\n\u0014\nNeurologist Professor Olaf Blanke and colleagues at Geneva University \nHospital in Switzerland were treating the women for epilepsy by using \nelectrodes to stimulate the brain. They found that stimulating one \nspot -- the angular gyrus in the right cortex -- repeatedly caused \nout-of-body experiences. \u0014\n\u0014\nInitially, the stimulations caused the woman to feel she was \n\"sinking\" into the bed, or falling from a height. When the current \namplitude was increased, she reported leaving her body. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe doctors believe the angular gyrus plays an important role in \nmatching up visual information and the brain's touch and balance \nrepresentation of the body.

    "title": "ORDINARY SAINTS AT FIRST CHURCH",
    "words": "It wasn't revivals or eloquent preachers that influenced pagan \nsociety but everyday Christians doing everyday evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\nPagans and Jews converting by the thousands after hearing the \npreaching of the apostles. Apologists, using logical and passionate \nargument, convincing elite Romans to believe in Christianity. These \nare the images once elicited in histories of evangelism in the early \nchurch. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut typical converts in the early days of Christianity probably did \nnot hear about the faith from an apologist or at a public rally. More \nlikely, their introduction came through \"everyday evangelism\"through \nthe ongoing life in the local church, the witness of individual \nChristians, and specialized \"parachurch\" ministries. \u0014\n\u0014\nMission-sensitive churches\u0014\nOrganized communities of faith deserve chief credit for evangelizing \nthe Roman Empire, both before and after Constantine. Imitating a \nmodel crafted by Paul, early Christians planted churches, nurtured \nthem, and made them centers for attracting and enlisting converts. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurches were founded in almost every way possible. Sometimes a \nbishop, presbyters, or deacons were sent to evangelize and organize a \nnew church. For example, in the mid-third century, Cornelius of Rome \nwas reputed to have sent seven bishops to Gaul (modern France) to \nplant churches. Other times, churches that had spontaneously formed \nthrough lay evangelism asked for a bishop to instruct them. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost churches had the same goal: evangelism. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Enlighten those in darkness,\" intones an early liturgical prayer \nfrom Egypt. \"Raise up the fallen, strengthen the weak, heal the sick, \nguide all, good Lord into the way of salvation and into thy holy \nflock.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSome converts learned about the faith through friendship with church \nmembers. Others saw or heard about exorcisms or healings. Some \nwitnessed the arrest of a Christian or even a martyrdom. Others lived \nin Christian households as slaves or indentured servants. By the end \nof the third century, Christians had built formal churches near pagan \ntemples across the empire. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever pagans heard about Christianity, they came to the church out \nof curiosity and stayed because it offered security in an age of \nanxiety. Visitors heard Christian teachers claim the church was the \npeople of God. They were told of promises of immortality and escape \nfrom eternal punishment, and of assurances of salvation. And they \nheard about, and sometimes witnessed, the power of two ceremonies, \nbaptism and the Eucharist. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe example of Christians' high moral standards and their practice of \noffering charity to all, regardless of social status, also made a \ndeep impression on unbelievers. Galen (129-199), the Greek physician, \nin commenting on those \"people called Christians,\" wrote, \"They \ninclude not only men but also women who refrain from cohabitating all \nthrough their lives, and they also number individuals who, in \nself-discipline and self-control in matters of food and drink, and in \ntheir keen pursuit of justice, have attained a pitch not inferior to \nthat of genuine philosophy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nClasses and the sacraments\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce inquirers displayed an interest in the Christian faith, the \ncatechetical process (something akin to today's confirmation or new \nmembers classes) probably provided the chief means for drawing them \ninto the fold. As depicted by Hippolytus around 217, these classes, \nwhich led to baptism, began with a preliminary inquiry by skilled \nteachers, engaging their students in a dialogue designed to point the \nway to conversion. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurches carefully sifted out candidates not likely to make the \nserious commitment, which was critical during periods of persecution. \nBefore enrolling them as \"hearers,\" Hippolytus wrote in The Apostolic \nTradition, teachers were to examine candidates about their lives and \ntheir reason for embracing the faith. The Christians who brought the \n\"hearers\" were asked to \"testify that they are competent to hear the \nword.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHippolytus wanted to exclude people in certain professionspanderers, \nsculptors or painters of idols, actors or pantomimists, teachers in \npagan schools, charioteers, gladiators and others connected with the \nshows, priests in other cults, military commanders or civil \nmagistrates, harlots or licentious persons, enchanters, astrologers, \ndiviners, soothsayers, and the likeunless they changed their \noccupations. He would not let magicians even make an inquiry about \nthe faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe rest of the initiation process, which took about three years (or \nas many as six in some places), primarily sought to secure an \nauthentic commitment. In the fourth century, Augustine outlined the \ntypical procedure for instructing people to faith. After scrutinizing \nthe candidate's motives, the catechist (teacher) would present the \nmessage of salvation history, from Creation to the Second Coming. The \ncatechist often had to deal indulgently and patiently with slow or \nstubborn candidates, repeating and prodding them on. \u0014\n\u0014\nCatechumens could participate only in the instructional (preaching) \nservice. After instruction the catechist prayed for the candidates, \nlaid hands on them, and dismissed them. (The Ite! Missa, meaning \"Go! \nYou have been dismissed/sent,\" is thought by some scholars to be the \nsource of the word Mass.) \u0014\n\u0014\nCatechumens were not allowed to participate in the Eucharist, which \nfollowed the preaching service. No doubt, the great mystery \nsurrounding this rite, (as well as reports of its efficacy) kept many \nstraining at the leash to receive baptism and post-baptismal \ninstruction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper had powerful appeal \nin the ancient world, where mystery cults (which were full of \nmysterious rites) prospered. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Eucharist, for example, seekers were told, one could partake \nof heavenly manna of an \"unbloody sacrifice\"not the costly offerings \nof bulls and goats and other plants and animals, which pagans were \nused to. Referring to a Dionysian ritual, Clement of Alexandria \nwrote, \"Come, O madman, not leaning on the thyrsus, not crowned with \nivy. Throw away the mitre, throw away the fawn-skin.\" Then, referring \nto Christ and the Eucharist, he said, \"Come to your senses! I will \nshow you the Word and the mysteries of the Word.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOrdinary saints and country hicks\u0014\n\u0014\nFormal traveling evangelists played a key role only during the second \ncentury. \"Casual\" evangelism, on the other hand, was important \nthroughout the early period. \u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to criticism that Christians were just a bunch of country \nhicks, Origen agreed that common folks accounted for Christianity's \nspread. The planting of Christianity in Georgia (former Soviet \nUnion), for example, resulted from the witness of a captive woman \nnamed Nino (see \"The Exile and the Slave Girl,\" page 21). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most famous example of individual witness, though, is Justin. He \nwas eventually martyred for his faith around 165, and he credited his \nconversion to two sources: first, to the fearlessness of Christians \nin the face of death. Second, he had a conversation with an old man. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt occurred during his years of spiritual searching, when he was \nreading philosopher after philosopher to understand the meaning of \nlife. One day while strolling on a beach in Ephesus, Justin met an \nold man, who engaged him in a discussion about philosophy. It was but \none conversation, and Justin never saw the man again. But this one \nconversation kindled in him, he said, a love for the prophets and for \n\"friends of Christ.\" Not long after that conversation, Justin \nconverted. \u0014\n\u0014\nParachurch schools\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars are not sure how evangelistic/philosophical schools came \ninto existence. Most likely they began with private initiative like \nmany of the other philosophical schools in the ancient world. Certain \nteachers established a reputation and gathered followers. Pantaenus \nlaunched the school in Alexandria made famous by Clement and Origen. \nJustin established a school in Rome where he could present \nChristianity as \"the true philosophy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHow did such teachers discharge their tasks? One of Origen's most \nfamous students, Gregory Thaumaturgus, described his story. \u0014\n\u0014\nGregory and his brother Athena-dorus crossed paths with Origen by \nchance on a trip to Caesarea, and Origen did his best to effect a \ndeep and genuine friendship with them. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnce he had persuaded them to remain in Caesaria, he taught them the \nphysical sciences, then philosophy and ethics, and finally the \nScriptures (which he considered the queen of all learning). \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it was his embodiment of what he taught, Gregory judged, that \nmost impressed him and his brother. \"And thus, like some spark \nlighting upon our inmost soul,\" Gregory later wrote, \"love was \nkindled and burst into flame within usa love at once to the Holy \nWord, the most lovely object of all, who attracts all irresistibly to \nhimself by his unutterable beauty, and to this man, his friend and \nadvocate.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result, Gregory became the fabled evangelizer, the \"Wonder \nWorker\" of Cappadocia (see \"Key Converts,\" page 22). \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it went: countless converts, by their lives and witness, \nbrought the good news to others on a very personal level, whether in \nchurch or in conversation. \u0014\n\u0014\nE.

    "title": "OPPRESSION OF FREEDOM RUNS RAMPANT TODAY",
    "words": "OPPRESSION OF FREEDOM RUNS RAMPANT IN THE\u0014\nBAPTIST EXPERIENCE TODAY.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Charles w: Deweese\u0014\n\u0014\nHistoric Baptist identity faces unparalleled challenges today. \nChiseled out of persecution in the 1600s, that identity emerged from \nand survived incredible odds. Because of Roger Williams's views about \nfreedom, the General Court of Massachusetts banished him from that \ncolony in 1635 soon before he founded the first Baptist church in \nAmerica. The state church in Massachusetts publicly arrested, tried, \nimprisoned, and whipped Baptist pastor Obadiah Holmes i n 1651. Other \nBaptists suffered severe consequences for their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow, one might ask, could Baptist identity today possibly be more at \nrisk than that~ Then, external forces worked against the Baptist \nspirit. Even so, Baptists hung together, unquestioningly endured the \nphysical pain inflicted on them, and fought until their dying days \nfor positive principles that shaped the early Baptist story in \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, numerous and dangerous internal factors puncture the Baptist \nsoul. Consider the following:\u0014\n1. Baptizing three- and four-year-olds counters believer's baptism.\u0014\n2. Creedalizing confessions of faith contradicts voluntarism.\u0014\n3. Stifling dissent violates liberty of conscience.\u0014\n4. Advancing civil religion negates separation of church and state.\u0014\n5. Failing to educate new Christians neutralizes a regenerate church \nmembership.\u0014\n6. Applying excessive Calvinism harms missions and evangelism.\u0014\n7. Exaggerati ng pastora1 authority downplays the priesthood of all \nbelievers.\u0014\n8. Exalting biblical inerrancy works against the Lordship of Christ.\u0014\nWhy do Baptists do these things to one another and to their historic \nideals- especially since those convictions were hammered out on the \nanvil of personal sacrifice in the 1600s~\u0014\nIs it apathy~ The need to control~ The urge to make church statistics \nlook better~ Inadequate theological education~ Personal ity confl ict \nand/or disorder\u0014\nAberrations in leadership styles~ The failure of denominational \npublishing houses to inject Baptist heritage into curriculum~ The \nbelief that being Baptist does not matter much anymore~ Or a mixture \nof these and/ or other reasons~\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere is the prophetic voice in Baptist life today? Using Scripture, \nRoger Williams challenged the very fabric of New England religion \nwith its \"forced rape\" of the faith of Indians, its requirement that \ninfants be baptized, and its blatant intolerance of other expressions \nof spirituality, 1ncluding that of Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nBOLD, PERSEVERING, ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED-THAT WAS ROGER WILliAMS.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHAT'S THE BAPTIST SOUL. THAT'S THE BAPTIST SPIRIT. THAT'S THE HEART \nOF BAPTIST IDENTITY.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the Prophet Amos, Williams applied the word of the Lord to \ncritical situations in which misguided forces of church and state \nmanipulated others for personal and corporate good and denied them \ntheir God-given freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps it's time to revisit the Baptist soul. Roger Williams was not \nsome deranged individual who had nothing to do but play games with \nthe state church of New England in the 16305 and 16405. He stood that \nstate church on its ear by undermining the entire thrust of New \nEngland religion-especially its emphasis on infant baptism, its \nintolerance for religious diversity, and its merging of church and \nstate.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe strongly influenced American civilization, preceding even john \nLocke, the Enlightenment, and the Bill of Rights with his rock-solid \nemphasis on the role of freedom in religion for all people. And \nWilliams refused to back down at any point even though the state \nchurch fought him tooth and toenail for years. Bold, persevering, \nabsolutely determined-=that was Roger Williams.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the Baptist soul. That's the Baptist spirit. That's the heart \nof Baptist identity. Radicality, serious commitment to the claims of \nChrist, and hearty defense of what is biblically right lie at the \ncenter \u0014\nof the Baptist dream. Those are the centers of action where Baptists \nhave had their finest hours. That's the Roger Williams/ Obadiah \nHolmes way of being Baptist and the way of hundreds of Colonia) \nBaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Baptist pastors to study the Bible and Baptist history \nin concert, to resurrect the dominant emphasis on liberty in both, \nand to proclaim such freedom with prophetic urgency.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Baptist historians to jump off the fences of neutrality \ninto the trenches of advocacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Baptist theologians to study the theology of the \nfounders of the Baptist experience, explore the cracks in creedalism, \nand reconstruct positive patterns of confessionalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome readers may conclude that this liberty-thrusted article abandons \nthe responsibility side of Baptist life. I u nderstand the i \nmportance of accountability. I have written one book on Baptist \nchurch covenants, another on the responsibilities of church \nmembership, and many articles on church discipline and regenerate \nchurch membership. Granted, these are critical concerns of the \nBaptist story.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I am 100 percent convinced that the foremost contributions of \nBaptists to world civilization lie in the realm of defending freedom \nin faith for everyone.\u0014\nOppression of freedom runs rampant in the Baptist experience today. \nWho, in God's name, cares? Do you care? Does your church care? I mean \nreally care?\u0014\nA time has come for Baptists to rethink their values. That kind of \nthought, done with intensive reflection, could help lead us and our \nchurches to hammer out new priorities-biblical, historical, \ntheological, and practical. It's time to take a new look at Roger \nWilliams, Obadiah Holmes, and other Colonial Baptists who subjected \nthemselves to potential martyrdom defending the soul of Baptists.\u0014",

    "words": "O Broken Town of Bethlehem\u0014\n\u0014\n                 by Mitri Raheb, pastor\u0014\n                 Christmas Lutheran Church, Bethlehem\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Christmas Lutheran Church was surrounded by Israeli \ntanks. My wife, Najwa, my daughters, Tala and Dana, my mother, Wadia, \nand I were at the parsonage. Israeli soldiers went from house to \nhouse, searching for Palestinian gunmen. When would it be our turn? \u0014\n\u0014\n                 We heard the soldiers breaking the doors at our \nneighbors. They had already killed an older neighbor woman and her \n36-year-old son, a former pupil of our Lutheran school. At 1:45 p.m., \nthe soldiers entered our compound and started by breaking the door to \nour youth room. I had to decide my next move: Should I stay inside \nuntil they reached our home, which probably would traumatize my \nfamily? Or should I go out and ask them to leave the church compound, \nwhich might risk my life? I decided to take the latter risk. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 I went out, telling the soldiers that I am the \npastor and would like to talk to the commander. When I reached my \noffice, 15 soldiers pointed their guns at me. I started talking to \nthem in Hebrew and then in English. At first, they thought I was a \nforeigner. Once I started talking in Arabic - on the phone with our \nbishop, to explain the situation - their attitude changed \ndramatically for the worse. One said, \"Arabic is the most ugly \nlanguage in the world.\" I replied: \"Then Hebrew must be as ugly as \nArabic since both are from the Aramaic roots. We are cousins! Don't \nyou know?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Another soldier said: \"We will let you pay the price \nbecause you have sided with the Arabs.\" I knew he was ignorant of our \nexistence, like so many people in the world who assume that Arabs are \nMuslims only. He was bewildered when I told him that I am not only a \nPalestinian Christian but also an Arab Lutheran pastor.\u0014\n                 \u0014\n                Another soldier told me, while destroying a painting, \n\"You have here a very beautiful facility.\" I said, \"We love beauty. \nWe have worked so very hard to make this a  beautiful place.\" A \nsoldier started making fun of me: \"You sound like a very wise \nperson,\" he said. I answered, \"The real wise person is one who can \ntransform his enemy into a neighbor, and not his neighbor into an \nenemy.\" The commander didn't like my answer. He shouted at me to shut \nup and ordered his soldiers not to talk to me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 This experience shows the core of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and our role as Christians in it. There \nalways have been more than one people in the Holy Land. Now there are \nat least two: Palestinian and Israeli. It's impossible for either to \nhave a monopoly over the whole land. It has to be shared between two \npeoples in two independent, yet interrelated states. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The vision for peace in the Holy Land can't be that \nof Babel - one people with one language. It has to be that of a \nshared Jerusalem at Pentecost: Jews and Arabs viewed as equals and \nenabled by the Spirit to communicate with and understand each other, \nliving in a city open to the adherents of all three monotheistic \nreligions, as well as guests of all nations. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It is now time to think of transforming the enemy \ninto a neighbor. Palestinians and Israelis need to discover the \nhumanity of the other. Reconciliation is the possibility to move \nbeyond the concept of \"winning the war\" and into \"winning the enemy\" \n- that is, to transform each other into a potential neighbor. Our \nrole as Christians is to restore justice by ending the Israeli \noccupation and to work for peaceful co-existence of two people and \nthree religions in two states. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 *Originally published in \"The Lutheran\": \u0014\n                 http://www.thelutheran.org\u0014",

    "words": "'Once You Forgive, There Will Be Healing'\u0014\n\u0014\nHow a martyr's widow turned her life around and won India's \nprestigious Gandhi harmony award.\u0014\nby S. David, with additional reporting by Manpreet Singh | posted \n01/31/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1999 Gladys Staines became a widow and a single parent after Hindu \nradicals torched the jeep in which her missionary husband and sons \nwere sleeping. Four years later, she is becoming one of India's most \ncelebrated peacemakers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an exclusive interview with Christianity Today, Staines, 50, said \nstrife-torn India urgently needs communal harmony. Theodore Williams, \nformer chairman of World Evangelical Fellowship and now a pastor at \nlarge at the Richmond Town Methodist Church, Bangalore, endorsed her \ncall. He said Staines's campaign for tolerance and religious harmony \nis \"more relevant now than ever.\" The western Indian state of \nGujarat, for example, has been reeling under severe religious tension \nsince February 2002. About 1,800 people have died in the continuing \nconflict between Hindus and Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years ago, the Staines family's tragedy appeared on the front \npages of newspapers worldwide. Graham Staines, 57, and the couple's \ntwo sons, Philip, 10, and Timothy, 8, were burned to death January \n23, 1999, in a remote village in the eastern Indian Orissa state, \noutside a small, makeshift church in the village of Manoharpur, about \n600 miles southeast of the Indian capital, New Delhi. The eldest \nStaines child, Esther, now 16, and Gladys Staines were at home on the \nnight of the fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe news media in India prominently featured Staines as she publicly \nforgave the killers. \"I have forgiven the killers, but the law must \ntake its own course,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonths later, officials arrested Dara Singh, a charismatic Hindu \nradical, and 10 supporters. Their murder trial in the Orissa state \ncapital of Bhubaneswar has had many delays. Singh protested his \narrest by engaging in two hunger strikes in his Orissa jail cell, \ncausing the trial to be postponed. Other court cases against Singh \nhave also contributed to delays in the prosecution testimony, which \nbegan in January 2002. There is extensive popular support for Singh, \nwho is also an animal rights extremist, and Hindu nationalist \nsupporters proclaim his innocence on a website dedicated to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the criminal trial has stagnated, Staines and her daughter have \nreclaimed their lives. Esther is an arts student at the Hebron \nAcademy boarding school in the south Indian hill station of Ooty, \nabout a seven-hour drive from Bangalore. Staines said her emotions \nstill run strong. \"I do feel sad sometimes. I am a woman. But I draw \ninspiration from God's Word and console myself, often identifying \nwith women like me who have also lost their children, maybe in \naccidents, natural calamities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe draws encouragement from American Annie Johnson Flint's hymn, \"He \nGiveth More Grace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That has been a great source of inspiration and strength for me to \ncope with the day to day work, the fact that his grace is always \nthere for us,\" Staines said. Flint's teaching career was cut short by \ncrippling arthritis. She spent the rest of her life writing 6,000 \nhymns and gospel songs and died in 1932. Staines said Flint's faith \nwas strongly evident in these words:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe giveth more grace as our burdens grow greater,\u0014\nHe sendeth more strength as our labors increase,\u0014\nTo added afflictions He addeth His mercy,\u0014\nTo multiplied trials He multiplies peace.\u0014\nIndian Hero\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the murders, Staines went back to her native Australia for a \nlengthy furlough. But she returned to Orissa to run the leper clinic \nthat her husband managed in Baripada. Indians nationwide see her as \nan example of compassionate Christianity. Sam Dorairaj Reuben , \nchairman of Far East Broadcasting Associates, said, \"She may be an \nordinary woman, but I believe God has used her as an extraordinary \ntool to spread his word mightily.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002 peace activists in India gave Staines the prestigious Gandhi \nCommunal Harmony award. She was one of three recipients, each from a \ndifferent religion. \"I accepted the award because it was for communal \nharmony. That is the need of the hour,\" she said, citing Romans 12 as \na biblical wellspring of her peace activism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Live peaceably with all men. Tensions will be there but that is \nwhere grace is required very much,\" Staines said. \"I can give a whole \nsermon on grace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMother and daughter speak to each other in Oriya, a local language in \nOrissa. Though she had not applied for Indian citizenship, she says, \n\"This is my home. This is where my husband and the children have \ndied.\" Staines is one of about 1,000 missionaries working legally in \nIndia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe federal government has not granted her a permanent visa. But many \nadmirers, including Swami Agnivesh, the internationally known \nactivist against bonded labor, have petitioned the prime minister and \nthe Indian president to grant Staines Indian citizenship.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe has pledged to remain in India: \"Graham would not have wanted me \nto pack my bags and just go off like that to Australia.\" She first \ncame to India in 1981. She met Graham at the Baripada leprosy home, \nwhere Graham had worked since he first came to India in 1965. They \nmarried in 1983. The Evangelical Missionary Society established the \nhome in 1897.\u0014\n\u0014\nStaines said people across India are aware of her commitment to \nIndia: \"I still receive hundreds of letters from people, many unknown \nto me, from different parts of the country expressing their support \nto me.\" Most of her friends are Hindus, she said, adding that she is \ncomfortable with Orissa customs, food, language, and clothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeprosy ministry\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent months, the tall and gracious Australian in a traditional \nblue Indian sari has been raising funds for a 40-bed hospital in \nmemory of her husband. It will cost the equivalent of $250,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe facility would be a major expansion. Leprosy (also known as \nHansen's disease) is a significant problem in India, home to an \nestimated 570,000 patients out of 1.8 million worldwide. The hospital \nwill have facilities for surgery and physical therapy. The existing \nleprosy home at Baripada will be converted into a rehabilitation \ncenter, able to handle 60 patients. Doctors can usually stop leprosy \nwith drugs, but the debilitating effects of the disease mean patients \nneed extensive reconstruction of damaged facial features, feet, or \nhands.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutreach to India's lepers itself is not controversial. Evangelistic \noutreach is. After the murders in 1999, some Hindu radicals accused \nGraham Staines of converting poor Hindus to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Gladys Staines told CT that her husband was teaching only local \nChristians at the time of his death. And his \"jungle camps\" were \nspecifically meant for Christians. \"Of course others could not be \nstopped from attending those meetings,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolished through hardship\u0014\n\u0014\nStaines agreed in June, as a prosecution witness at the murder trial, \nto testify about her husband's work. Facing aggressive questions from \ndefense attorneys, Staines under oath denied that her husband bribed \npeople to induce conversion. \"It is not a fact that we have converted \nhundreds of people into Christianity,\" she testified. \"My husband had \ncome to India to serve leprosy sufferers and rehabilitate them in the \nsociety.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHindu nationalists have been sharply critical of Staines. The state \ngovernment in Orissa has opposed the use of land for the new \nhospital. Other Hindu radicals resist any Christian effort to care \nfor poor Hindus. The federal government provides security when she \nspeaks in public. \"The hate campaign is part of life,\" she said. \n\"What is necessary is to keep working for the welfare of the \ndowntrodden. The Lord is watching us and he will take care of us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSince 1999 Staines has traveled widely. \"As I travel the length and \nbreadth of India, there is a lot of support for my cause,\" Staines \nsaid. But Staines told CT that people most often ask her why a \npeace-loving man like her husband and two innocent kids were \nmurdered. \"I will never have answers to those questions, maybe only \nin heaven,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nStaines does not hide emotional wounds, which are still raw. \"If we \ndon't experience the grace of God, we become bitter. We have to turn \nto God, not to others. Experience forgiveness and forgive others. \nGrace is available. Once you forgive, there will be healing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever people praise her for her act of courage and goodness, she \nbecomes uncomfortable. \"I am an ordinary woman with all the baggage \nan ordinary woman carries. I am like anybody else,\" she says. \"I need \nto be often in communion with God, so please don't put me on a \npedestal. I am very human. I get discouraged.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My prayer to the Lord is: Take me as I am. You know how precious \nstones become crystal clear? They go through polishing and hardship, \nand that's how our lives should be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStaines said memories of Graham, Philip, and Timothy are never far \nfrom her mind. \"I keep having this dream that my husband and the kids \nare playing in a vast green field with lovely landscape.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is like paradise, and they are playing with each other, including \nwith my mother. I picture heaven like this and get comfort. I know \nthe Lord loves little children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd with the hope comes a deeper empathy: \"When I see boys with their \nmothers and little children, I sense the hurt. The pain is there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nS. David and Manpreet Singh are journalists in India.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Hall | posted 02/18/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Moved Mover: A Theology of God's Openness\u0014\nClark H. Pinnock\u0014\nBaker Academic, 224 pages, $19.99\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare \nTheodicy\u0014\nGregory A. Boyd\u0014\nInterVarsity, 456 pages, $25\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the Evangelical Theological Society debates the orthodoxy of \nopenness theology (CT, January, p. 24), Most Moved Mover and Satan \nand the Problem of Evil are working out the finer theological points \nof \"theodicy\" (the problem of evil), the nature and extent of God's \nforeknowledge, and issues regarding the doctrine of God itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpenness theologians are convinced that if human beings are to \nexercise meaningful freedoma basic requirement for love to be \nexpressed and receivedthere must be aspects of the future, those \nentailing the free choices of rational beings, that God does not know \nexhaustively.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1994 Clark H. Pinnock and four other scholars published The \nOpenness of God, one of the foundational books of the openness \nmovement. In Most Moved Mover, Pinnock (retired professor of \nsystematic theology at McMaster Divinity College in Hamilton, \nOntario) reviews the controversy that has surrounded the movement, \nresponds to some critics of openness, and describes what he considers \nweaknesses in classical Christian theology's understanding of God's \nnature and knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine, for instance, \"was wrong to have said that God does not \ngrieve over the suffering of the world; Anselm was wrong to have said \nthat God does not experience compassion; Calvin was wrong to have \nsaid that biblical figures that convey such things are mere \naccommodations to finite understanding.\" The classical view, Pinnock \nbelieves, has been too deeply influenced by \"pagan assumptions about \nGod's nature,\" such as God's immutability, timelessness, and \nimpassibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to the classical model, Pinnock offers a model of God as \n\"most moved mover,\" a God whom he describes as \"compassionate, \nsuffering, and victorious love.\" Instead of \"attributing to God \nqualities that undermine God's own self-disclosure,\" Pinnock \nencourages his readers to understand biblical metaphors as \n\"reality-depicting descriptions of the living God, whose very being \nis self-giving love.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPinnock's \"most moved mover\" is deeply relational, a trinity of \ndivine love in communion, and hence desires to enter into personal \nrelationships with his creation, \"not because he needs to . . . but \nbecause he wants to since relationality is an essential aspect of \nGod.\" God is not coercive or manipulative. To force human beings into \na relationship, however much God desires to be in relationship with \nus, would violate his own nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is here that Pinnock's proposal becomes more controversial. \nBecause of God's deeply relational nature, God has chosen to relate \nto the world not only as its sovereign Lord, but also in a relation \nof dependence. \"God affects the world, but is also affected by the \nworld. God is sovereign, but he has also given power to creatures.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's dependence extends even to his knowledge of the future. \"Though \nGod knows all there is to know about the world, there are aspects \nabout the future that even God does not know. Though unchangeable \nwith respect to his character and the steadfastness of his purposes, \nGod changes in the light of what happens by interacting with the \nworld.\" If so, God's relationship to creation is \"temporal and not \ntotally different from ours.\" God relates to creation \"within the \nstructures of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Pinnock contends that \"there is temporal succession in God's \nthinking; he remembers the past, interacts with the present and \nanticipates the future.\" If God's intensely personal relationship to \ncreation is to be preserved, there are aspects of the \nfutureparticularly regarding the free choices of personal \ncreaturesthat God cannot know in advance. To maintain freedom, both \ndivine and human, God has purposely chosen to limit his knowledge. \nGod is deeply moved by his creation, but can do so only by relating \nto creation within time. \"At least since creation, the divine life \nhas been temporally ordered. God is inside, not outside, time. He is \ninvolved in the thick of, and is not above, the flow of history.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGregory Boyd Tackles Theodicy\u0014\nGregory Boyd is the preaching pastor at Woodland Hills Church in St. \nPaul, Minn., and the author of God of the Possible and Across the \nSpectrum, among several books. Satan and the Problem of Evil is the \nsecond volume of a multi-volume attemptGod at War (IVP, 1997) was \nthe firstto construct an openness theodicy. Boyd seeks coherent \nanswers to the questions all theodicies face: Where does evil come \nfrom? If God is the sovereign Creator, is he not ultimately \nresponsible for evil? Do God's sovereignty and control extend to \nevery act of evil and suffering? What of Satan and the demonic realm? \nIn what way does the reality of the demonic relate to sin, evil, and \nsuffering?\u0014\n\u0014\nBoyd develops a number of key theses in his attempt to make coherent \nphilosophical sense of the \"warfare worldview\" of the Bible. For \ninstance, why would God choose to create personal beings, both \nangelic and human, knowing they would be capable of producing evil on \nsuch a massive scale? Boyd's answer is that love must be freely \nchosen and entails the risk of rejection: \"God could not have created \na world in which creatures possess a measure of self-determining \nfreedom without risking some loss.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod could have chosen to create a universe where self-determining \nfreedom did not exist, but for the sake of love and love's \nrequirements, he has instead elected to create an environment in \nwhich love can flourish.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne does not need to accept the openness model to be thankful to Boyd \nfor deepening our awareness of the broader supernatural context of \nlife lived between the times. The contemporary church lives in a war \nzone, and much of the suffering and evil that human beings experience \nbecomes more coherent when viewed against the dark backdrop of \nSatan's continuing attempt to disrupt God's redemptive purposes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs God Embodied?\u0014\nOpenness theology is naturally controversial, as it challenges \nevangelicals to reconsider the definition of God's sovereignty. \nAdding to that controversy, though, is the hermeneutic that these \ntheologians bring to biblical texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, think of God's response to the repentance of the \nNinevites in the Book of Jonah. \"When God saw what they did, how they \nturned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity \nthat he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it\" \n(3:10, NRSV). Openness theologians such as Boyd insist that we read \nsuch texts \"straightforwardly\"assuming that God did not know how the \nNinevites were going to respond to Jonah's preaching. If God had \nknown \"with certainty that Nineveh was going to repent,\" Boyd writes, \n\"then his prophecy that the city would be destroyed in forty days \nseems disingenuousit does not express a real intention.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if we consistently take biblical texts at \"face value,\" where \nwill we end up? For instance, Pinnock draws our attention to the many \nOld Testament texts that portray God as having a body. Moses, Aaron, \nNadab, Abihu, and 70 elders of Israel see God on Mount Sinai. Under \nGod's \"feet\" they see \"something like a pavement of sapphire stone.\" \nDespite seeing God, these men do not perish. Other texts describe \nMoses speaking \"face to face\" with God, \"as one speaks to a friend\" \n(Ex. 33:11). Later in the same chapter (v. 23), Moses is described as \nallowed to see God's \"back\" but not his face.\u0014\n\u0014\nPinnock writes: \"Human beings are said to be embodied creatures \ncreated in the image of God. Is there perhaps something in God that \ncorresponds with embodiment? Having a body is certainly not a \nnegative thing because it makes it possible for us to be agents. \nPerhaps God's agency would be easier to envisage if he were in some \nway corporeal. Add to that the fact that in the theophanies of the \nOld Testament, God encounters humans in the form of a man.\"\u0014\nWe are only a few steps away, it seems, from the assertion that God \npossesses a body of sorts, spiritual though it may be.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Continuing Debate\u0014\nNot all openness theologians would agree with Boyd and Pinnock, but \ntheir ruminations, for good or ill, are consistent with an openness \nhermeneutic, a method of biblical interpretation that consistently \nopts for the literal or \"face value\" meaning of biblical texts. Those \nof us who disagree with the openness proposal must take the openness \nhermeneutic seriously and provide a more convincing and coherent \nexplanation of Scripture than the openness theologians themselves \nprovide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe openness model must continue to be tested philosophically and \ntheologically. For example, must exhaustive divine foreknowledge \neliminate human freedom? Not at all. Christian philosophers such as \nAlvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, and David Hunt have offered \ncoherent alternatives to the openness model of knowledge and freedom \nthat deserve more careful attention and study.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Nicholas Wolterstorff has commented, openness theologians have \ngiven a sound tug to the sweater sleeve of theological positions \naccepted for hundreds if not thousands of years. It should surprise \nno one if the sweater begins to unravel as openness theologians \ncontinue to develop their theology. I discussed some of my own \nconcerns in \"Does God Know Your Next Move?\" (CT, May 21, 2001).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, while some theologians and exegetes appear ready to cut off \ndiscussion of the openness model, certain aspects of the openness \nmodel must be debated vigorously. For example, has classical \nChristian theology been as deeply tainted by pagan philosophy as \nPinnock maintains? Does God's intensely personal nature, a \ncharacteristic affirmed by both openness and classical theologians, \ndemand that God limit his knowledge of the future along the lines \nadvocated by Pinnock and Boyd? Perhaps most seriously, does the \nopenness hermeneutic's attempt to take biblical passages at \"face \nvalue\" lead inevitably to the embodiment of God and the possibility \nof divine error?\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther testing of the openness model is surely necessary. Only in \nthe heat of lively, fair, and irenic debate will the model's hairline \nfractures become clearly visible.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher A. Hall is associate professor of biblical and \ntheological studies at Eastern University in St. Davids, \nPennsylvania, and a CT editor at large.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Our Bodies, \nOur Fears\u0014\n\u0014\nAs they reach for the duct tape, Americans say theyre more anxious \nthan ever. Scientific research about how our brains and bodies \nprocess fear can teach us how to live with long-term stress By \nGeoffrey Cowley NEWSWEEK\u0014\n\u0014\nFeb. 24 issue   Anthony Lepre started feeling awful almost as soon \nas Tom Ridge put the nation on high alert for a terrorist attack last \nweek. The normally well-adjusted Los Angeles chiropractor started \ntossing and turning instead of drifting off to sleep at night. He \nawoke in the middle of the night short of breath, his heart pounding. \nAnd the sound of his telephone seemed a sure sign of bad news.   \u0014\n\u0014\n    BY MIDWEEK, HE was rushing off to Costco to stock up on fruit \njuice, aaaaaaaaaaaaa water, peanut butter, canned tuna and extra \nfood for my cats Monster, Monkey and Spike. He also picked up a \nfirst-aid kit, six rolls of duct tape and a bulk package of plastic \nwrap to seal his windows. The biggest problem was that I felt \nhelpless, he says, completely powerless over the situation. The \nhealth-conscious 46-year-old even found himself chomping pizza and \nsweets, figuring a few treats would help him forget about the \nsituation for a while.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it went for millions of Americans. The recent barrage of bad \nnewsnukes in North Korea, snipers in Maryland, a failing economy, an \nimminent war, a threat of domestic terrorhas left this privileged \nnation feeling unusually vulnerable and uncharacteristically anxious. \nGas masks and biohazard suits are selling as briskly as duct tape and \nplastic sheeting. Winter vacations are on hold. Psychotherapists are \nworking overtime. And even people who soldiered on after 9-11 are now \nblinking. Thirty-five-year-old Kateria Niambi, a lifelong Brooklynite \nwho works as a marketing director in lower Manhattan, never thought \nof leaving New York during the grim fall of 2001. Yet she recently \nbought a house in suburban New Jersey and now plans to pack up her \ntwo daughters and move. It was like, Where can I go that my kids \nwill be safe?  she says.\u0014\n       \u0014\nHELPLESSNESS AND HEALTH\u0014\n       Iraqi civilians are no doubt asking the same question. \nIsraelis and Palestinians have asked it for decades. And though \nAmericas current worries may seem unprecedented, the current \nsituation has nothing on the 1918 flu pandemic or the Cuban missile \ncrisis. Yet none of that makes living with fear any easier. As Drs. \nAfton Hassett and Leonard Sigal of New Jerseys Robert Wood Johnson \nMedical School wrote recently, were living in a chronic heightened \nstate of alertness and ... helplessness, prompted by a poorly \ndefined ... danger that could strike at any time in any form without \nwarning. Such feelings can be as unhealthy as they are unpleasant, \nimpairing immunity, interrupting sleep and exacerbating everything \nfrom acne to ulcers. The psychological state of fear affects us \nbiologically, says Los Angeles psychiatrist Carole Lieberman. \nPeople who are anxious drink and eat more. They have more accidents. \nTheyre more likely to get colds or suffer heart attacks. In short, \nas University of Michigan neuroscientist Stephen Maren puts it, a \nbrain system designed to keep us from getting eaten is now eating \naway at us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n        Such is the paradox of fear. It is, as Saddam might say, the \nmother of all emotionsa response so fundamental to survival that we \nshare it with rodents, fishes and fruit flies. Yet fear and anxiety \ncan shackle us, diminish our lives, even kill us. Until recently, no \none knew how the brain generated such feelings or why they were so \nhard to will away. When New York University neuroscientist Joseph \nLeDoux started studying fear as a graduate student in the late 1970s, \nmost experts believed it was beyond the reach of neuroscience. Since \nthen, it has been elucidated more clearly than almost any aspect of \nthe psyche. Besides sussing out the function and dynamics of the fear \nresponse, researchers have started to pinpoint its underlying \nmechanisms, and even manipulate them. When you consider that 19 \nmillion Americans suffer from fear-related disorders even in the best \nof times, the value of such insights is hard to exaggerate.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The feelings inspired by vague threats are of course \ndifferent from the ones youd experience in a burning building or a \nhijacked airplane. But theyre not entire-ly separate. Fear and \nanxiety exist on a continuum. Theyre rooted in the same physiology \nand can have similar consequences. To get at the essence of anxiety, \nyou have to start with the anatomy of fear. The brain is not just a \nthinking machine. Its a biological adaptation, designed to promote \nsurvival in the environments where it evolved. As neuroscientist \nSteven Hyman of the National Institutes of Mental Health observes, \nSurvival depends on the ability of an organism to respond to threat \nor reward, and predict the circumstances under which they are likely \nto occur. The brain structures that handle that job evolved long \nbefore the neocortex (the seat of conscious awareness), and they \neasily override it. The emotional brain, as LeDoux calls this web \nof ancient circuitry, is highly attuned to signs of potential danger. \nAnd through a process known as fear conditioning, it can readily \nlearn to perceive a mundane stimulus as a warning sign. Expose a rat \nto a distinctive sound before administering a shock, and after a few \nrepetitions the sound alone will trigger a paralyzing fear response. \nSubject a soldier to extreme trauma in a tropical setting, and moist \nsummer breezes may later cause him white-knuckle panic attacks.\u0014\n       \u0014\nFEAR AND THE BRAIN\u0014\n       Twenty years ago no one knew how fear conditioning worked. But \nby surgically removing discrete parts of rodents brainsand \nperforming the same simple conditioning experimentresearchers have \ndetailed the underlying mechanisms. The fear systems command center \nis the amygdala, a small, almond-shaped structure that rests near the \ncenter of the brain and is elaborately tied to other regions through \nnerve fibers. A rat lacking an amygdala wont freeze at the sound of \na tone, no matter how often the tone is paired with a shock. And \nthough human subjects cant be carved up or electrocuted for the sake \nof science, studies of patients with damaged amygdalas show that they \nhave similar deficits. Unlike people with intact brains, theyre no \nmore attuned to emotionally charged words such as rape than to bland \nones like handkerchief. And though they can recognize individual \nfaces, they dont perceive threatening expressions as unfriendly. \nEven a split-second glance at a hostile face activates the amygdala \nin a normal brain.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn activated amygdala doesnt wait around for instructions from the \nconscious mind. Once it perceives a threat, it can trigger a \nbody-wide emergency response within milliseconds. Jolted by impulses \nfrom the amygdala, the nearby hypothalamus produces a hormone called \ncorticotropin releasing factor, or CRF, which signals the pituitary \nand adrenal glands to flood the bloodstream with epinephrine \n(adrenaline), norepinephrine and cortisol. Those stress hormones then \nshut down nonemergency services such as digestion and immunity, and \ndirect the bodys resources to fighting or fleeing. The heart pounds, \nthe lungs pump and the muscles get an energizing blast of glucose. \nThe stress hormones also act on the brain, creating a state of \nheightened alertness and supercharging the circuitry involved in \nmemory formation. The amygdala tells the rest of the brain, Hey, \nwhatever happened, make a strong memory of it, says James McGaugh, \na neurobiologist at the University of California, Irvine. It makes a \nstrong correlation between the significance of an event and the \nremembrance of it.\u0014\n        You wouldnt want it any other way. Yet as researchers learn \nmore about the fear response, theyre also learning more about the \nhuge costs it imposes. Like any aggressive defense establishment, the \namygdala and its army of stress hormones can divert resources from \nother critical uses. It can also cause extensive collateral damage. \nConsider the experience of Elizabeth Brace. She was 37 years old and \nliving in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., in 1994, when a powerful \nearthquake struck 100 miles away in Northridge. The temblor didnt \nknock her house down, or even break her dishes. But it jolted her out \nof bed and sent her running, terrified, to pluck her son from his \ncrib. When she didnt come back, her husband went to the childs room \nto find her face down on the floor, bleeding from the nose and mouth, \ndead. By all indications, the quake had scared her to death.\u0014\n       \u0014\nFEAR AND STRESS\u0014\n       Harvard neurologist Martin Samuels collects stories like \nBraces to show just how dangerous the stress hormones can be. \nNorepinephrine is toxic to tissuesprobably all tissues, but in \nparticular the heart, he says. Israel recorded nearly 100 excess \ndeaths during Saddams 1991 Scud missile attacksnot from bomb \ninjuries but from heart attacks presumably triggered by fear and \nstress. And a recent study suggests that heart patients around New \nYork City suffered life-threatening heart arrhythmias at more than \ntwice the usual rate in the month following the World Trade Center \nattack. Prolonged stress has physiological consequences, says Dr. \nJonathan Steinberg, chief of cardiology at New Yorks St. \nLukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center and the leader of the study. These \npatients experienced potentially fatal events, even though many of \nthem had trouble identifying themselves as unduly fearful.\u0014\n\u0014\n In other words, acute fear is not the only kind that can hurt you. \nConstant, low-grade adrenaline baths may subtly damage the heart, \nraising the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. Continuous \nexposure to cortisol can dampen the immune system, leaving stressed \npeople more vulnerable to infections and possibly even cancer. Stress \nhormones can harm the brain, too, severing connections among neurons. \nIn both human and animal studies, researchers have found that \nprolonged stress also shrinks the hippocampus, a brain structure that \nplays critical roles in processing and storing information.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Even when it doesnt wreck the heart or the brain, prolonged \nstress can have countless subtler effects. And Lepre, the L.A. \nchiropractor, is not the only one feeling them. Pierluigi Mancini, \nthe director of a community counseling clinic in Norcross, Ga., says \nhis clinics family and adolescent program has recently seen a \nsixfold increase in the number of people seeking help. Kids are \nacting out, and adults dont know what to do or who to talk to about \nthe terror alerts, Mancini says. People are reporting head-aches, \ninsomnia, back pain, neck pain, disorientation. But after a physical \nexam, we cant find a physical cause. Such complaints are common \namong worried people, and you dont have to be a hypochondriac to \nexperience them. Stress almost always comes out in a bodily \nsymptom, says Afton Hassett, an expert in psychosomatic illness. \nEven at low levels, she says, anxiety causes muscle tension, which \nleads in turn to aches, pains and twitching eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\n FEAR AND KIDS\u0014\n       Children are especially vulnerable to fear and anxiety. Im \nseeing a lot of regressive behavior, says Lieberman, the Los Angeles \npsychiatrist. Lots of parents are telling me their kids are afraid \nto sleep, or go to school, because they dont want to be separated if \nsomething catastrophic happens. Anxious children are even more \nlikely than adults to experience their anxiety as a stomachache or a \nphysical malaise, and emotional experiences have deeper effects on \ntheir still-developing brains. Kids learn everything faster than \nadults, says Dr. Bruce Perry of the ChildTrauma Academy in Texas. \nIf they have the stress response turned on a lot, their bodies say, \nIm in a world where I need to use these systems a lot.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Genes and temperament make some kids less vulnerable than \nothers. But when a susceptible child experiences too much fear, the \nconsequences can extend beyond general anxiety to include phobias and \nposttraumatic stress disorderconditions in which the amygdala \nhijacks the rest of the brain every time it encounters some cue. Like \na rat in a conditioning experiment, the sufferer reacts as violently \nto a harmless stimulus as she would to a life-threatening emergency.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Some 11 million Americans (mostly women) suffer from phobias. \nSome phobias are general, others specific, but theyre all \ntenaciousfor unlike names, our fears are never forgotten. What keeps \nmost people from being paralyzed by them is not erasure but a \nphenomenon known as extinction, in which neurons in the cortex create \nnew memories to compete with the visceral ones managed by the \namygdala. Researchers have recently traced this fear-busting capacity \nto a particular part of the prefrontal cortex. In a recent study, \nstimulating this brain structure helped rats extinguish their \nconditioned fear responses more rapidly. Experts now hope that \nelectromagnetic devices will help phobic people down the same path.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTREATING FEAR\u0014\n       But in truth, the path is already open. We can take people \nwith very severe phobias and treat them in a day or two, says Dr. \nDavid Barlow of Boston Universitys Center for Anxiety and Related \nDisorders. The treatment has several components, but at its heart is \nan exercise that Barlow calls talking to the amygdala. Instead of \nsimply telling people that high places can be safe, he takes them to \nhigh places. By surviving the experience, and surviving it again, \nthey form the new memories needed to temper the oppressive ones. The \ntechnique is as old as fear itself, but neuroscience has begun to \nshow us why it worksand why avoiding what scares you is so futile.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Thats not to say that fear is never rational. \nSixty-nine-year-old Doro Adelstein considers herself a gambler and, \nas such, likes to improve her odds. When the Queens, N.Y., widow \nheard the warnings of impending terror last week, she decided to use \na free plane ticket shed been saving to hide from Osama bin Laden \namong the white tigers and crap tables of Las Vegas. I know I cant \nstay here forever, she says as she tugs a slot-machine arm at the \nMGM Grand Hotel & Casino, but I was in Manhattan on 9-11 and it was \nthe worst day of my life. Whenever they say theres going to be \nanother attack, I remember what it was like that day. This time it \nseems really real, and I figured the terrorists are less likely to \nattack Las Vegas than New York, dont you think?\u0014\n\u0014\n        Your guess is as good as hers. At least shes enjoying \nherselfno small accomplishment amid so much uncertainty. Anyone with \na TV and an amygdala is sure to experience anxiety in the coming \nweeks and months. For those lacking tickets to Vegas, the best remedy \nmay be to turn off the set, venture into the world and come home \nalive to remember it.\u0014\n\u0014\n       \u0014\nWith Andrew Murr, Mary Carmichael, Julie Scelfo, Debra Rosenberg, \nDavid Jefferson, Ana Figueroa and Steve Friess\u0014\n       \u0014\n        2003 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

    "title": "ON HIS OWN TERMS -- JONATHAN EDWARDS",
    "words": "On His Own Terms\u0014\nEdwards has much to say to us today, if we can get past his peculiar \naccent.\u0014\n\u0014\nA conversation with George Marsden\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat thinkers like Jonathan Edwards can be hard to approach. Many \nwho have read him are convinced that the Northampton divine has much \nto offer the church today. But he seems to float somewhere above \nussevere, austere, out of reach. What a shame! He is surely one \nwhose teachings transcend his own time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's no denying that, unlike John Wesley, his colleague in the \ntransatlantic awakening, Edwards can seem distant and forbidding. But \nsome of this is a factor not of who he was, but of the distance \nbetween our world and his. We see him through a glass darkly.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn search of the \"real Edwards,\" CH spoke with George Marsden, whose \nbiography, Jonathan Edwards: A Life, is being published in 2003 by \nYale University Press. Marsden helped us see beyond our \nmisconceptions to the precious legacy of this imposing man.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas Edwards a \"cold fish\"? He refused to do regular pastoral \nvisitation, he seemed more comfortable with his books than his \npeople, and eventually he pushed his ideals on his congregation so \nhard that they tossed him out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some basis for the stereotype. Edwards was a serious person, \nparticularly serious about matters of salvation. When he wrote \nletters to his children, almost invariably the first thing he said \nwas, \"You are away from home, and it is possible you might die, and \nwe hope that you will care for your eternal soulthat would give us \ngreat joy,\" or words to that effect. There's not a lot of chit-chat \nabout family news.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen his son, Jonathan Edwards Jr., was 10 years old and away on a \nmissionary trip to learn Indian languages, Edwards wrote him a \nletter. The week before, the elder Edwards had fallen off a horse and \nbeen badly injured. But in this letter, he never mentions that to his \nson. You would think he'd mention it as an example to say, \"be \ncareful,\" or as a good story, but he limits his letter to salvation \nand serious matters. That is characteristic.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, he apparently could relate well to people who were \nclose to him. He had 10 sisters and 11 children, and they all seemed \nvery affectionate toward him. Also, relations of the heart were at \nthe center of Edwards's theology. The heart was more important than \nthe intellect in his personal relationships and his relationship with \nGod. His whole theology was built around the love of God and the ways \nwe should be reflecting that love.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo along with that seriousness, there is a lot of warmth and genuine \nconcern for others. Edwards is thought of as a stern, cold minister, \nbut in fact, he had his entire congregation and the entire town of \nNorthampton completely \"under his spell.\" Though this relationship \ndid eventually go awry, the intensity of the breakup mirrors the \nintensity of their earlier affections.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocially, he seems an elitist, someone who might even have been out \nof step in his own, increasingly egalitarian age.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink of him as a creature of the world of British hierarchical \nrelationshipsthink (even though they were later) of the novels of \nJane Austen. Whereas today we tend to see structures of patriarchal \nprivilege as demeaning, people of the eighteenth century tended to \nsee social hierarchy and the deference that went with it as good \nthings. These relationships held society together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no question where Edwards stood in that social hierarchy: \nHe played the role of an aristocratpart of an important family of \nministers and magistrates. The most significant of these was his \nuncle and chief patron, John Stoddard. He ran much of the government \nof Western Massachusetts and was chief judge and a military leader as \nwell. Edwards was related to a whole network of people like that.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, it is true that there was some chafing under that hierarchical \nsystem. So Edwards was coming into conflict, in the 1740s, with those \nwho wanted to see change. But he did sometimes break the old molds. \nLike his father, Timothy, he worked against some of the prerogatives \nthat men had and women did not. He encouraged his sisters, wife, and \ndaughters to pursue educationthough this did not include college, \nsince women did not go to college in his day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, like most in his age, he had a blind spot toward \nslavery. Though affirming a kind of spiritual equality by welcoming \nslaves into his congregation, he himself held slaves and saw no need \nto set them free. In the decades after Edwards's death, though, \nduring the era of the American Revolution, Edwards's closest \ndisciple, Samuel Hopkins, became an anti-slavery leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we can get past some of these things, how should we understand the \nlegacy of Edwards? Do we see his fingerprints on American religion \ntoday?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was the first person to publicize revival on a large scale, and he \nbecame part of the wider movement that, during his lifetime, birthed \nwhat we now know as evangelicalism. His was not an itinerant or \nmass-meeting revivalism, however, but a local, church-based one.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis legacy can be most clearly seen in the many churches today that \nstill have ongoing and renewing \"revivals.\" He was also the great \ntheoretician of revivals; he analyzed them, seeking to distinguish \nbetween legitimate and illegitimate revivals. Revivalists ever since \nhave referred back to that work.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis fingerprints are also seen in American education. Most of the \nimportant colleges and even state universities founded in America in \nthe first half of the nineteenth century were founded by New \nEnglanders seeking both to educate and to evangelize the nation. They \nmoved into the Midwest, taking ideals of education with them inspired \ndirectly by Timothy Dwight, Edwards's grandson and president of Yale. \nMany of these college founders looked to Edwards himself as one of \ntheir inspirations.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of those same people pursued a related program of national \nsocial reform, founded on Samuel Hopkins's notion of \"disinterested \nbenevolence\"a reworking of an Edwards idea. Their efforts profoundly \nshaped the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can we learn today from Edwards about religious experience?\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards spent his whole life working on the question of discerning \nwhich religious experiences were valid and which were not. At first, \nhe defended most of the extravagant manifestations of revivals, the \nphysical things, on grounds that they don't prove anything one way or \nanother.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut by the time he wrote Religious Affections, he was more cautious. \nThe signs of true affections he offers in that book are all about how \nyour experiences play out in the quality of your Christian lifein \nattitudes, fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace, and so forth. He \nargues that people are missing the point if they say that there is \nsome sort of physical manifestation that is characteristic of true \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe still wants to say that there's nothing intrinsically wrong with \nsuch manifestations. But his principle is that every revival will be \nimitated by Satanthat's why it's hard to tell whether revival \nexperiences are really benefiting those involved. The long-run test \nwas the qualitative change in your life, not the joy bells ringing \nfor a while.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about Edwards's theology? What does it offer today?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, Edwards's theology was God-centered. That seems obvious, but \nthe Enlightenment was pushing God to the borders of the universe and \ninflating the human self. In Edwards's time and ever since, \nEnlightenment-influenced theologies have started with humans, built a \nsystem of morality that suits us, then tried to tailor God to fit our \nmorality.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards, on the other hand, insists on starting with God, as He is \nportrayed in Scripture. Whatever is true virtue, he says, must be \nfirst a virtue that is related to the loving God who stands at the \ncenter of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did \"Edwards the scientist\" do with the Newtonian universe, with \nits distant God and its mechanical processes?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Edwards, the universe itself is the language of God, declaring \nHis glory. It is not identical to God, but it is the medium through \nwhich He speaks. So Edwards saw types of Christ not only throughout \nScripture, but also through nature (see pp. 40-41). If you are given \nthe eyes or ears to do so, you can see and hear the beauty of God in \nall reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards didn't buy the clockwork universe and absent clockmaker god \nof the deists. He said that in a dynamic, Newtonian universe, the \nmost basic, important relationships are personal ones, not mechanical \nones. Everything is in relationship with God and is upheld by his \nlove.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

The whip's three cords slammed onto the bare back of Obadiah \nHolmes where he stood tied to the post. Thud... Thud... Thud. Thirty \ntimes the executioner struck with all his force. It was on this day, \nSeptember 5, 1651 in Boston, Massachusetts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    According to witnesses, Obadiah did not groan or \nscream. Instead, he preached to                                       \nthe crowd. When the whipping was over, he said, \"You have struck me \nas with                \u0014\n                    roses.\"\u0014\n   \u0014\n                    To observers, it was obvious that he was badly \nwounded. As a matter of\u0014\n                    fact, he was so hurt that he had to stay in \nBoston for several weeks and\u0014\n                    could only eat while kneeling on his elbows and \nknees. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    How could he take this punishment so bravely? \nObadiah was filled with joy\u0014\n                    because he considered that the Lord Jesus Christ \nhad counted him worthy\u0014\n                    to suffer for the sake of truth. The beating came \nabout because he crossed\u0014\n                    into Massachusetts from neighboring Rhode Island \nand held a Baptist\u0014\n                    service in a private home in Puritan New England. \nArrested with him were\u0014\n                    the Rev. John Clarke and another man. If Obadiah \nhad been willing to pay a\u0014\n                    fine of 30 pounds he could have escaped the \nwhipping. (30 pounds was a\u0014\n                    large sum of money for a poor man in those days; \nObadiah's whole estate\u0014\n                    at his death was valued at only 130 pounds.) But \nhe was so sure that he\u0014\n                    was right that he even refused to help his \npersecutors to unbutton his shirt,\u0014\n                    much less pay the unjust fine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Like the majority of inhabitants in New England, \nObadiah was an immigrant\u0014\n                    from England. He did not become a Baptist until \nhe settled in\u0014\n                    Massachusetts. Unable to bear the civil \nrestrictions in Salem, he moved to\u0014\n                    Rehobath. There his teaching split the local \nchurch and he became leader\u0014\n                    of a small Baptist group. The colony's leaders \nordered him \"to desist, and\u0014\n                    neither to ordain officers, nor to baptize, nor \nto break bread together, nor\u0014\n                    yet to meet upon the first day of the week...\" \nAnd so Obadiah and his wife\u0014\n                    moved to Rhode Island, setting up house for the \nthird hobbes's since coming to\u0014\n                    America. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    In 1652, Obadiah succeeded Clarke as pastor of \nthe Newport Baptist\u0014\n                    Church. He was only the second pastor of that \ncongregation, which was\u0014\n                    the first Baptist Church in the New World. He led \nthem for almost exactly\u0014\n                    thirty years--until his death in 1682. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    To the very end, Obadiah kept his eyes on the \nthings of God. He had nine\u0014\n                    children and 42 grandchildren when he died.

    "words": "\u0014\n     Obadiah Holmes, Man of Courage\u0014\n     By Hal Mayer, History Instructor, Hartland College, & Director, \nHartland Stewardship\u0014\n     Ministries\u0014\n     \u0014\n          Obadiah Holmes clearly understood what it meant to be \npersecuted for righteousness\u0014\n          sake. He was a Baptist living in Connecticut in 1651 when \nhe and John Clark, a Baptist\u0014\n          minister, and another man were called to travel to \nMassachusetts to anoint a dying blind\u0014\n          man by the name of William Witter. It was illegal in \nMassachusetts to teach anything but\u0014\n          infant baptism. Infant baptism was safe in Massachusetts, \nso long as it was defended by\u0014\n          the sword of steel. But in the field of argument against \nthe sword of the word, it would\u0014\n          crumble in one big heap.  \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       The three men began their \nservice in Mr. Witters\u0014\n                                       home on Sunday morning. No \nsooner had they\u0014\n                                       started the service than the \nconstable arrived and\u0014\n                                       arrested them for holding \nunauthorized meetings and\u0014\n                                       preaching without a license. \nBefore taking them to\u0014\n                                       prison in Boston, however, the \nconstable made them\u0014\n                                       attend a Congregational church \nservice nearby. Mr.\u0014\n                                       Holmes kept his hat on during \nthe service until it was\u0014\n                                       forced off of him. He reckoned \nthat the service was\u0014\n                                       not genuine, as it was not \nconducted according to\u0014\n                                       the Bible.  \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       The judge sentenced the three \nmen to fines: John\u0014\n                                       Clark 20 pounds, Obadiah \nHolmes 30 pounds\u0014\n                                       (because of his hat), and \ntheir accomplice five\u0014\n                                       pounds. If their fines were \nnot paid before the next\u0014\n                                       court sitting, they would be \nwhipped. Some\u0014\n                                       well-meaning souls paid the \nfines for John Clark and\u0014\n                                       the other companion and they \nwere released, but\u0014\n          Obadiah Holmes refused to have his fine paid for him. He \nfelt that he had not done\u0014\n          anything wrong and to pay a fine would be an admission of \nwrongdoing.  \u0014\n\u0014\n          While in prison, he was tempted by the devil with \ndiscouragement and arguments to\u0014\n          dissuade him from being whipped. But always, he says, the \nLord brought him comfort and\u0014\n          courage until the day of execution of the sentence. Obadiah \nwas taken to the place of\u0014\n          punishment in the open street in Boston. Before sentence \nwas executed, he asked if he\u0014\n          could speak, but was refused (the magistrate being \nconcerned that his voice would\u0014\n          convince others of his heretical doctrines). But he began \nto speak anyway.  \u0014\n\u0014\n          Men, brethren, fathers, and countrymen,  seeing I am to \nseal what I hold with my\u0014\n          blood, I am ready to defend it by the word,  the Lord \nhaving manifested His love towards\u0014\n          me,  and so to be baptized in water,  and now come to be \nbaptized in afflictions by\u0014\n          your hands, that so I may have further fellowship with my \nLord, and am not ashamed\u0014\n          of His sufferings  \u0014\n\u0014\n          As the lashes began to strike across his bare back, Obadiah \nHolmes was surprised that\u0014\n          the strokes of the three-tailed whip gave him no outward \npain, though the spectators said\u0014\n          the whipping was grievous, the man striking with all his \nstrength. When he was finally\u0014\n          released, he told the magistrate: You have struck me as \nwith roses  \u0014\n\u0014\n          Obadiah Holmes was a man of courage, and vision. He could \nsee that by his suffering\u0014\n          others would be led to accept the truth and reject the \nerror. He actually remained in a\u0014\n          private home for a while, teaching biblical baptism to all \nwho came to visit him. Some were\u0014\n          then baptized in the biblical way. Upon hearing that the \nmagistrate had a warrant out for\u0014\n          his arrest again, he escaped by night back to his home in \nConnecticut just in time. Do you\u0014\n          think that similar courage and active testimony will be \nrequired of God's people in the\u0014\n          future?\u0014",

When he arrived in the \ncity, people were thronging in the streets. He asked why all the \nexcitement and was told that this was the day that the gladiators \nwould be fighting in the coliseum, the day of the games, the circus. \nHe thought to himself, \"Four centuries after Christ and they are \nstill killing each other, for enjoyment?\" He ran to the coliseum and \nheard the gladiators saying, \"Hail to Caesar, we die for Caesar\" and \nhe thought, \"this isn't right.\" He jumped over the railing and went \nout into the middle of the field, got between two gladiators, and \ntried to stop them. The crowd became enraged and stoned the \npeacemaker to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Emperor of Rome, Honorius, heard about the monk he declared \nhim a Christian martyr and put an end to the games.

No \none may have noticed then, but within the week, copies of his theses \nwould be discussed throughout the surrounding regions; and within a \ndecade, Europe itself was shaken by his simple act. Later generations \nwould mark martin Luther's nailing of the 95 theses on the church \ndoor as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, but what did \nLuther think he was doing at the time? To answer this question, we \nneed to understand a little about Luther's own spiritual journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man in Germany at the beginning of the sixteenth century, \nLuther was studying law at the university. One day he was caught in a \nstorm and was almost killed by lightening. He cried out to St. Anne \nand promised God he would become a monk. In 1505, Luther entered the \nAugustinian monastery, and in 1507 became a priest. His monastic \nleaders sent him to Rome in 1510, but Luther was disenchanted with \nthe ritualism and dead faith he found in the papal city. There was \nnothing in Rome to mend his despairing spirit or settle his restless \nsoul. He seemed so cut off from God, and nowhere could he find a cure \nfor his malady.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was bright, and his superiors soon had him teaching \ntheology in the university. In 1515, he began teaching Paul's epistle \nto the Romans. Slowly, Paul's words in Romans began to break through \nthe gloom of Luther's soul. Luther wrote\u0014\n\u0014\nMy situation was that, although an impeccable monk, I stood before \nGod as a sinner troubled in conscience, and I had no confidence that \nmy merit would assuage him. Night and day I pondered until I saw the \nconnection between the justice of God and the statement 'the just \nshall live by faith.' Then I grasped that the justice of God is that \nrighteousness by which through grace and sheer mercy God justifies us \nthrough faith. Thereupon I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone \nthrough open doors into paradise. The whole of Scripture took on a \nnew meaning...This passage of Paul became to me a gate to heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe more Luther's eyes were opened by his study of Romans, the more \nhe saw the corruption of the church in his day. The glorious truth of \njustification by faith alone had become buried under a mound of \ngreed, corruption, and false teaching. Most galling was the practice \nof indulgences -- the certificates the church provided, for a fee, \nsupposedly to shorten one's stay in Purgatory. The pope was \nencouraging the sale of indulgences. He planned to use the money to \nhelp pay for the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Tetzel was one of the indulgence sellers in Luther's vicinity. \nHe used little advertising jingles to encourage people to buy his \nwares: \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from \npurgatory springs.\" Once Luther realized the sufficiency of Christ's \nsacrifice alone for our sins, he found such practices revolting. The \nmore he studied the Scriptures, the more he saw the need of showing \nthe church how it had strayed from the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on this day, October 31, 1517, he posted a list of 95 \npropositions on the church door in Wittenberg. In his day, this was \nthe means of inviting scholars to debate important issues. No one \ntook up Luther's challenge to debate at that time, but once news of \nhis proposals became known, many began to discuss the issue Luther \nraised that salvation was by faith in Christ's work alone. Luther \napparently at first expected the pope to agree with his position, \nsince it was based on Scripture; but in 1520, the Pope issued a \ndecree condemning Luther's views. Luther publicly burned the papal \ndecree. With that act, he also burned his bridges behind him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBainton, Roland. Here I Stand.

    "words": "December 14, 1655 \u0014\nCromwell Welcomes Jews\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first large groups of Jews came to England from France in 1066 at \nthe invitation of William the Conqueror. He felt that Jews, with \ntheir crafts and financial skills, would boost the English economy. \nBecause it was considered wrong for Christians to engage in money \nlending, the role fell to the sons of Israel. In the years that \nfollowed, ruthless kings taxed Jews unmercifully, forcing them to \nraise the interest they charged on loans. This led to resentment on \nthe part of borrowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn outbreaks of anti-Semitism Jews were accused of blood rituals and \nmassacred. Their lending records were conveniently destroyed during \nthese outbreaks. In 1217, they were forced to wear yellow badges. By \n1290, they had been taxed so heavily that they were no longer of use \nto Edward I, who could, in any case, now do business with the Knights \nTemplars. Edward expelled the Jews from England.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor 365 years, it was illegal for an Israelite to live in England. A \nfew Marranos (Portuguese converts to Christianity) reentered the \ncountry in the early 1600s. The Marranos flourished and sought to \nchange the restrictive law.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel approached Oliver Cromwell with a \nseven-point plan in November 1655, the Protector determined to ask \nfor readmission of the Jews. He recognized their benefit to English \ncommerce and intelligence- gathering.\u0014\n\u0014\nCromwell asked his Council to decide the issue. The Council \nestablished a committee. The committee invited a number of ministers, \nmerchants and justices to help them with its decision. Between \nDecember 4 and 18th, this Conference met in Whitehall. Cromwell \nattended each session and expressed himself in favor of readmitting \nthe Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the members of the committee, including the clergy, resisted \nCromwell. However, two judges gave it as their opinion that the law \ndid not forbid Jews to settle in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy this day, December 14, 1655, it was evident the committee would \nnever come to a decision. On the 18th, Cromwell dismissed it, letting \nits members know that he intended to admit the Jews unofficially if \nnecessary. All the committee managed to do was to draw up a paper \nrecommending that if Jews were readmitted to England, they be \nprevented from defaming Christianity or working on the Lord's day. \nThey should not hold office, employ Christian servants or seek to \nconvert Christians to Judaism. None of this became law.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter that, the Semites came to England in increasing numbers. Their \npopulation has reached as many as a quarter of a million. For the \nmost part, Britain's Jews have been well-treated since 1656.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to scripture (Zachariah), whoever touches the Jews, touches \nthe apple of God's eye. Does this also mean that those who help the \nJews prosper? Jews have benefited Britain. Many served in Parliament \nand one, Benjamin Disraeli, became a notable Prime Minister. More to \nthe point, British Jews helped fulfill Bible prophecy. English Jews, \nsuch as Moses Montefiore, were strong supporters of the Zionist \nmovement which resettled Jews in Israel, and Chaim Weizmann, the \nfirst president of the state of Israel, was British.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, John.

Whether \ndictatorships or democracies, nearly all have written constitutions, \nbut that of the United States is by far the oldest. This is something \nwe can too easily take for granted, but it really marked a pivotal \nturning point in history and the way nations came to govern \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you suppose the founding fathers ever thought of having a \nwritten Constitution? The idea of a written contract between the \npeople and their government came from a tiny band of 50 Christians \ncalled Pilgrims that sailed to America in the Mayflower in l620. The \nPilgrims believed many of the Church of England's traditions were not \nBiblical. Since both King James and the state church persecuted many \ncritics as criminals, the Pilgrims became Separatists and fled first \nto Holland, then to America. They planned to land in Virginia, where \nthey had a charter from the King to govern them, but Atlantic storms \ncarried them far north to Cape Cod. Since their charter was not valid \nin that region, they needed a new government.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so on this day, November 21, l620, the Pilgrims drew up and \nsigned the Mayflower Compact (which is actually dated the 11th of \nNovember because Britain was still using the Julian calendar) . It \nsaid: \"For the glorie of God and advancement of ye Christian faith, \nwe do... ...covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body \npolitick...to enact,... and frame... just and equal laws...for the \ngeneral good of the Colonie, unto which we promise all due submission \nand obedience.\"\u0014\nSeveral of the men aboard did not sign. Did they believe the document \nwas illegal?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe compact was modeled after the church covenant that the Pilgrims \nhad drafted and signed in l607 when they had first separated from the \nEnglish Church and fled to Holland. For the next fifty years, the \nMayflower compact served the Pilgrims well, and it became an \nimportant precedent for the idea of a written American Constitution \nat the Convention of l787.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCurtis, A.

    "title": "OASTLER'S LETTER SHOCKED ENGLAND",
    "words": "September 29, 1830 \u0014\nOastler's Letter Shocked England\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Oastler was outraged. Born into a Wesleyan Methodist family \nand educated by Moravians, he was a man of conscience who believed \nwords should be matched with deeds. That is why he took up his pen to \nwrite a letter. The letter, blasting \"Yorkshire Slavery\" was \npublished on this day, September 29, 1830 in the Leeds Mercury.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is the pride of Britain that a slave cannot exist on her soil,\" \nhe began. Richard declared himself in complete sympathy with efforts \nto end slavery. However, slavery was not limited to the colonies, he \nsaid: \"Let truth speak out, appalling as the statement may appear. \nThe fact is true. Thousands of our fellow-creatures and \nfellow-subjects, both male and female, the miserable inhabitants of a \nYorkshire town, (Yorkshire now represented in Parliament by the giant \nof anti-slavery principles) are this very moment existing in a state \nof slavery, more horrid than are the victims of that hellish system \n'colonial' slavery.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir slavery took a different form, to be sure, but slavery it was, \nall the same. \"Thousands of little children, both male and female, \nbut principally female, from seven to fourteen years of age, are \ndaily compelled to labour from six o'clock in the morning to seven in \nthe evening, with only--Britons, blush while you read it!-- with only \nthirty minutes allowed for eating and recreation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAction was needed. \"'Vow one by one, vow altogether, vow with heart \nand voice, eternal enmity against oppression by your brethren's \nhands; Till man nor woman under Britain's laws, nor son nor daughter \nborn within her empire, shall buy, or sell, or HIRE, or BE A SLAVE!\" \nhis long, passionate letter thundered.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that day forward, Richard was as good as his word. He labored \nwithout ceasing to get conditions improved. That very September, one \nof the factory owners, John Wood, approached Richard, saying, \"I have \nhad no sleep tonight. I have been reading the Bible and in every page \nI have read my own condemnation. I cannot allow you to leave me \nwithout a pledge that you will use all your influence in trying to \nremove from our factory system the cruelties which are practiced in \nour mills.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard promised to do what he could. \"I felt that we were each of us \nin the presence of the Highest and I knew that that vow was recorded \nin Heaven,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis letter was read by John Hobhouse, a radical member of Parliament. \nHobhouse immediately introduced a bill that would not permit children \nunder nine to work, eliminated night work for children, and limited \ntheir hours of employment to ten a day. A modified bill without teeth \nin it soon passed, but Richard had to fight for a stronger act, \nenforced by penalties.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another letter written four years later, he said, \"The mill-owners \nobtained their wealth by overworking and by defrauding the factory \nchildren. They were praying people, but took care their work people \nshould neither have time nor strength to pray. These hypocrites \npretended it was necessary to keep these poor infant slaves at this \nexcruciating labour just to preserve them from 'bad company' and to \nprevent them learning 'bad habits'.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard helped form Short Time Committees in major industrial cities \nto improve hours of work. He advocated sabotage of machinery in cases \nwhere employers were especially cruel. Rejecting laissez \nfairecapitalism, he insisted that producers follow St. Paul's \ninjunction that \"The husbandman [i.e.: worker] who labors, must be \nthe first partaker of the fruits.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNext time that you have to work no more than an eight hour day, \nremember Richard Oastler and his \"Yorkshire Slavery\" letter which \nfired the shot that changed your world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCowherd, Raymond Gibson.

Eleven elephants were taking part in the parade at a school \nwhen the incident occurred. \u0014\n\u0014\nEyewitnesses said an elephant named \"Vinayan\" became violent after \nseeing another elephant called \"Vijay Krishnan\" being ill-treated by \nits mahout.

    "words": "July 6, 1768 \u0014\n\u0014\nOberlin's Awkward Proposal Resulted in Marriage\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTake her for your wife.\" The voice in John Frederick Oberlin was \ninsistent. He believed it was God speaking to him. Yet he protested.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is impossible. Our dispositions and our tastes are so different.\" \nFrederick (for so he was called) was careful not to waste a penny or \na minute; and he was ironical. His sister's friend Madeline was \nlively and charming with habits he considered frivolous. Expense was \na real concern to Frederick. His three little parishes in the \nAlsatian mountains were dirt-poor. Knowing that he would have to make \nthe most of very little, he had adopted as his principle, \"The best \nwork for me is where I can do the most good with the least pay.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nElegant, city-bred Madeline was visiting Frederick's sister to take \nfresh mountain air after an illness. Frederick talked with her and \nwatched. Courteously he corrected her faults. Madeline answered with \nspirit and held her own with the well-educated pastor. On several \noccasions Frederick heard her say she would never marry a pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick wasn't particularly looking for a wife. His mother had \ntried to marry him off before he left Strasbourg for Schliethen. \nFrederick asked God for a sign in each case. The signs were not met \nso he stayed single. His sister Sophie accompanied him as his \nhousekeeper.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow his heart told him he should ask Madeline to marry him. Again he \nasked for a sign. Only if Madeline accepted him at once would he go \nthrough with marriage. After a sleepless night, he approached her \nwith this awkward proposal: \"You are about to leave us, my dear \nfriend: I have had an impression that you are destined by the Divine \nwill, to be the partner of my life. If you can be resolved upon this \nstep, so important to us both, I expect you will give me your honest \nopinion about it before you go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMadeline blushed. Covering her eyes with one hand, she stepped \nforward and put the other in Frederick's hands. They were married on \nthis day July 6, 1768.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd a good marriage it proved to be. In one of the most extraordinary \neducational success stories of all time, Frederick used every means \nto improve the lot of the poor villagers, usually over their \nsuspicious objections. With Madeline anchoring him, he was able to \naccomplish an extraordinary amount of work. He led the way in \nconstructing a road and bridge to the outside world and demonstrated \nproper methods of farming. He made his \"worthless\" parsonage land \nbloom with fine fruit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadeline identified completely with his goals, even voluntarily \noffering her precious earrings to help support an educational \nministry of which he greatly approved. The pair established schools \nand orphanages. When peasant wives resisted making cloth to \nsupplement their incomes, Madeline set the example by practicing the \ncraft.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their wedding Frederick had written a prayer. \"May we love each \nother only in thee [God the Father] and in our Savior Jesus Christ, \nas being members of his body.\" He also prayed that the two of them \nmight die with one another. After sixteen years of marriage, Madeline \ndied. Frederick pleaded with tears to be taken, too, but he lived on \nfor many more years. He was a long time overcoming his grief and \nnever remarried.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBeard, Augustus Field.

    "title": "OPTIMIZING BRAIN FITNESS",
    "words": "You can increase the power of your brain through your own effort. The \nbrain's ability to change in response to experiencecalled \nplasticityis the key to understanding the brain's development. The \ngood news is that no matter how old you are, you can still take an \nactive part in influencing brain plasticity. The brain is dependent \non your experiences and continues to evolve throughout your lifespan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to improve your brain, it's necessary to understand how it \nworks. In this course you will learn how the brain is organized, how \nit develops, and how messages are transmitted through the brain's \nelectrochemical pathways. Neuroscientists like to say that \"cells \nthat fire together wire together.\" Think of brain circuits like \nfriendships: Those that are maintained and enriched will endure, \nwhile those that are neglected disappear.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnriched environments are the key to optimal brain development. \nLaboratory animals provided with toys, companions, and more spacious \nliving conditions grow additional brain cells. They also get smarter \nand perform better on behavioral tests such as wending their way \nthrough mazes. In humans, sensory and social deprivation early in \nlife leads to decreases in intelligence, emotional health, and \nadaptation. But this dependence on the richness of environmental \nstimulation is not limited to early development. At every moment, \nyour activities and your thoughts are modifying your brain. \nIntelligence is not something like eye color that you're born with \nand cannot changeit is a dynamic process that can be favorably \ninfluenced by choices you make.\u0014\n\u0014\nProper diet, exercise, and sleep are critical for optimal brain \nfunctioning. In general, what's good for the heart is good for the \nbrain. By cutting down on empty calories in your diet, you can avoid \nobesity, which is now recognized as a risk factor for late-life \ndementia and other cognitive deficits. Research shows that regular \nexercise brings about positive changes in the brain function of \nchildren as well as adults. Simple, straightforward measures to \nimprove sleep can also lead to big dividends at every age. More \nsleep, for instance, is characteristic of high-achieving students. \nPower naps can also help to enhance memory consolidation and \ncognitive performance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttentionalso referred to as focus and concentrationmust be rock \nsolid in order to marshal the effort needed to improve your brain's \nperformance. Attention in the mental sphere is the equivalent of \nendurance in the physical sphere. Just as an athlete cannot perform \noptimally without endurance, you cannot expect to achieve a \nsuperpower brain without being able to laser focus your mental \nenergies. In order to do this, you must successfully manage 2 key \nfactors in our current culture: distraction and multitasking. When \nyou focus your attention on something, you have an easier time \nlearning it and are more likely to remember it. The more you learn \nand the better you remember it, the greater your power to retrieve \nand use that information.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if any piece of information can be instantly retrieved via a \nGoogle search, why bother to remember it? Because the act of \nremembering something facilitates the activation and retention of \ncircuits within the brain that contribute to the brain's optimal \nfunctioning. Overreliance on electronic information aids can result \nin a disuse atrophy of your memory powers, but this atrophy can be \novercome by deliberate efforts to improve memory. You'll learn how to \nenlist all of your senses in exercises and techniques that can \nenhance brain function in visual imagery, imagination, and longterm \nmemory.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorking memory, also known as short-term memory, is the key to the \nmost important mental operation carried out by the human brain: \nmanipulating stored information. By improving your working memory, \nyou can increase your intelligence as measured by standardized tests, \nalong with such indirect measurements of intelligence as occupational \nachievement and creativity. Deliberate practice is the key to \nimproving performance and creativity in all areas of human endeavor, \nincluding work and play.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern technology can be distracting, but it can be used to improve \nbrain function. Think of technological aids as coextensions of your \nbrain, capable of acting as brain boosters. A laptop computer, for \ninstance, functions as a powerful and refined electronic extension of \nbrain assistants dating back to the earliest writing instruments. \nVideo games, wisely used, can help you notice more, concentrate \nbetter, respond more quickly, and acquire specific real-world skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy challenging your brain to learn new information throughout your \nlife, you build up cognitive reserve. This is analogous to monetary \nreserve: The more you have accumulated over your lifetime, the less \nsusceptible you will be to deficits in your later years. In general, \nthe more education and knowledge people acquire over their lifetime, \nthe less likely they are in their later years to be diagnosed with \ndementia. In this practical course, you'll learn what steps you can \ntake in your own life to enhance your brain function.\u0014",

    "title": "ODD BEDFELLOWS-THE CIRCUMCISION FIGHT",
    "words": "ON SEPTEMBER 9th hundreds of Muslims and Jews marched side by side \nalong the streets of Berlin in protest at a new local ordinance \nrequiring circumcision to be carried 'out in a sterile environment, \nwith \"as little pain as possible\" (assumed to mean with local \nanaesthesia) and only with both parents' consent. For both faiths, \nthat was an attack on religious freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe merits and costs of circumcision are under scrutiny as never \nbefore, in rows involving religious leaders, human-rights activists \nand health professionals. Some stress the medical benefits. Others \ninvoke religious and cultural autonomy, and parents' rights. \nOpponents cite risks (including botched cutting). They want ritual \ninfant circumcision banned as a traumatic and anachronistic abuse of \nbabies' bodies. \u0014\n\u0014\nA court in another German city, Cologne, ruled three months ago that \ncircumcision of infants and young boys was the illegal infliction of \nbodily harm. Though the case involved a four-year-old Muslim boy,  it \naroused fury among Germany's 120,000 [ews+and others around the \nworld. It was \"hard to think of a more appalling decision\" Britain's \nchief rabbi.jonathan Sachs, fumed. Angela Merkel, the chancellor, \nsaid Germany risked becoming a \"laughing stock\" if Jews were no \nlonger allowed to practise their rituals. Charlotte Knobloch, a \nHolocaust survivor and former head of the Central Council of Jews in \nGermany, who has spent her life promoting German-jewish \nreconciliation, wondered whether \"this country still wants us\".\u0014\n \u0014\nRoughly a third of the global male population, including half of all \nAmerican men, are circumcised. In orthodox Judaism the procedure is \nmandatory eight days after a baby's birth, carried out by a mohel, a \nspecially trained rabbi, without painkill- ers. Removing the foreskin \nis a core part of both identity and faith: a sign of belonging, and \nof God's covenant. Though common among some Muslim traditions, the \nKoran does not mention it and no specific rules govern the practice; \nmost Muslim circumcisions are thought to be carried out by relatives. \nIn many African countries, male circumcision is a rite of passage, \nsometimes with dire or lethal results. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow legal worries are making doctors in Germany and elsewhere \nnervous. In the Austrian province of Vorarlberg the authorities have \nordered state hospitals to stop all non-therapeutic circumcision \npending legal clarification. The Royal Dutch Medical Association has \ncalled for the practice to be discouraged. In Finland a right-wing \nlawmaker has called for it to be criminalised. In California last \nyear, proposals to let local governments ban circumcision made it \nonto the ballots in some cities, including San Francisco. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven in New York, the city's health board is poised to adopt rules \nthat some Jews complain will allow officials for the first time in \nAmerican history to dictate details of the ritual. The ordinance will \nrequire mohelim to warn parents of the risks involved, including \ninfection, brain damage or even death, in carrying out an \nultra-Orthodox practice in which the mohel briefly sucks blood from \nthe baby's wound before applying a dressing. City officials say that \nin the past ten years 11 newly circumcised babies contracted herpes \nfrom the procedure; two died and two suffered brain damage.\u0014\n \u0014\nHassidic rabbis claim the statistics are flawed and that no risks are \nrun. Some 200 say they will ignore the new ordinance. But Rabbi \nGerald Skolnik, the head of Rabbinical Assembly, an international \nassociation of Conservative rabbis, has praised the city's move. \nSuction by mouth, originally designed to prevent illness at a time of \nlittle medical knowledge, was not required by Jewish law, he said. \nThe \"serious health risk\" involved clashed with Judaism's \n\"pre-eminent concern with life and human health\".\u0014\n \u0014\nThe medical aspects of mainstream circumcision are under review too. \nMaimonides, a revered Jewish medieval philosopher and physician, \nwrote of \"the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse \nand a weakening of the organ in question.\" Victorian England believed \ncircumcision stopped boys from masturbating. This, says Toby Lichtig, \na British Iewish writer on the subject, was probably what \u0014\ncaused the practice to spread to non-Jews in Britain and America. \u0014\n\u0014\nModern medicine has reached a some what different conclusion. Last \nmonth the American Academy of Paediatrics changed its stance, taken \nin 1999, that the risks of circumcising infants outweighed benefits. \nNow it recommends that the pro- cedure be covered by insurance \n(though it stops short of backing routine circumcision of babies). \nThe shift came after research showed that circumcision reduces the \nrisk of urinary-tract infections in the baby's first year, giving a \nmedical reason \u0014\nfor carrying it out as early as possible. In addition, the academy \nreckons that for every 909 circumcisions one man will be spared \npenile cancer. In sexually active males, it cuts the transmission of \nHIV;  of HPV  (viruses that cause cervical cancer); and of other \ninfections. Furthermore, the research found no harmful effect on male \nsexual function or satisfaction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese arguments about health may justify conducting a procedure \nwithout the child's consent. But medicine only partially helps those \nwho defend circumcision as a religious ritual. They also have to \njustify what critics see as amateur surgery. That could mean dealing \nwith calls for mohelim to undergo medical training (many already do) \nor licensing. Forswearing the use of painkillers for religious \nreasons is also a hard sell in secular societies. That the baby is \ntoo young to remember what happened is for many child-rights \nadvocates an unpersuasive argument. For all that, many Jews and \nMuslims will not willingly change the practices of generations.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n-\u0014",

She has three kids and eight grandkids.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Spruill has fought through serious health problems  she \nbelieves they were brought on by the stress of discovering the \nlongtime family secret in 2004, when her husband/father died  she is \nrelentlessly upbeat and optimistic.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years, she overheard odd whispers she couldnt figure out. She \nfinally learned the truth from an uncle not long after her \nhusband/fathers death.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked to estimate how many people know about this, she laughs \nand says, Half of Akron.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpruill says she confirmed the relationship with a DNA test. And if \nanyone doubts it, she says, she still has plenty of his DNA: About \nfive years ago, she found a hairbrush of his that somehow had become \nlodged under their dresser.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I think its safe to say there arent a lot of support groups \nfor people who marry their fathers. Fortunately, Spruill has been \nworking with a therapist since she found out. She praises the \ntherapist for helping her realize she did nothing wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve been getting great help, she says, because, God knows, if I \nhadnt of went and aired out how I feel, I wouldnt have made it, \nbecause I would have continued to stress out about this problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the pain understandably persists. As she tells her tale to a \nwriter whom she doesnt know but says she trusts, an occasional drop \nof moisture slides down her dark brown skin toward a mouth that cant \nseem to avoid curling upward in the corners even as she dredges up \nthe most traumatic of memories.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man in question, Percy Spruill, died in April 1998 at the age of \n60. Born in Mississippi, he worked in Akron as a truck driver and, \nlater, as a parking-lot attendant at Morley Health Center.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe and Valeries mother hooked up when he was only 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere not sure how many offspring Percy Spruill helped produce, but \nat one point, apparently, he figured that one of them would be a \nsuitable spouse.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Valerie says she is not 100 percent certain he knew, because \nhe never talked about it, she strongly believes he was aware of the \ntaboo he had committed but was simply afraid to tell her.\u0014\n\u0014\nValerie certainly isn't the first person to make a shocking discovery \nabout a partner.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames and Maura, whose real names have been concealed, grew up 100 \nmiles apart and met during a night out in Ireland in a town neither \nwas from, the BBC reported in 2010. They began dating; she got \npregnant, and they moved in together. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter some time, Maura convinced James to contact his estranged \nmother, according to the BBC. When James visited his mother, and told \nher about Maura, pieces of the story led his mom to discovering Maura \nis actually his half sister. A DNA test confirmed the truth. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn another case, it took Indian bride Minati Khatua of Rourkela six \nmonths to discover that she had married a woman and not a man, \nTelegraph India reported in 2010. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter suspicions arose, Khatua forced open the door as her \"husband\" \ntook a bath only to discover he was a woman. She eventually called \nthe police. NDTV reported that the fraudulent woman fled with a car \nand a jeep purchased with money from Khatua's bank account.\u0014",

    "title": "OFFICERS IN THE EARLY CHURCH",
    "words": "ELDER\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the years of Israel's captivity in Babylon and the following \ncenturies, elders again appeared as leaders who were responsible for \ngoverning in the Jewish communities. These elders became the upper \nclass, forming a type of ruling aristocracy. Later in this period, a \ncouncil of elders of 71 members, called the SANHEDRIN, emerged. This \ncouncil had both religious and political authority among all the \nJewish people in Palestine, particularly in New Testament times. The \nHIGH PRIEST was the chairman of the Sanhedrin. Local Jewish \nsynagogues, which emerged in the period between the Old and New \nTestaments, were also governed by a council of elders.\u0014\n\u0014\nA governing structure similar to the ruling elders among the Jews was \nfollowed in the early church. The title elder was continued, but the \nsignificance of the office changed. Thus, the term elder is used in \nthe New Testament to refer to the Jewish elders of the synagogue, to \nthe members of the Sanhedrin, and to certain persons who held office \nin the church. It also implied seniority by reason of age (1 Tim 5:2; \n1 Peter 5:5).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe presence of elders in the church in the New Testament indicates \nthat this office was taken over from the synagogue. Elders were \nassociated with James in Jerusalem in the local church's government \n(Acts 11:30; 21:18) and, with the apostles, in the decision of the \nearly church council (Acts 15). Elders were also appointed in the \nchurches established during the apostle Paul's first missionary \njourney (Acts 14:23). Paul addressed the elders at Ephesus (Acts \n20:17-35). Elders played an important role in church life through \ntheir ministry to the sick (James 5:14,15). They were apparently the \nteachers also in a local congregation. In addition to ministering to \nthe sick, their duties consisted of explaining the Scriptures and \nteaching doctrine (1 Tim 5:17; 1 Peter 5:5).\u0014\n\u0014\n(from Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Copyright  1986, Thomas \nNelson Publishers)\u0014\n\u0014\nELDER\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the New Testament. They were associated sometimes with the chief \npriests (Matt 21:23), sometimes with the chief priests and scribes \n(16:21), or the council (26:59), always taking an active part in the \nmanagement of public affairs. Luke speaks of the whole order by the \ncollective term of eldership (Grk. \"presbuterion\"; Luke 22:66; Acts \n22:5). There is no specific account of the origin of the eldership in \nthe apostolic church. We find officers called interchangeably elders \nor presbyters and bishops (Grk. \"episkopos\", \"superintendent\"). This \noffice pertained to local congregations, was extended as the churches \nmultiplied, and was distinguished from that of deacon. Elders first \ncame into prominence on the scattering abroad of the disciples and \nthe withdrawing of the apostles from Jerusalem, following the death \nof Stephen. They were associated with James to give direction to the \naffairs of the church, appear to have been a well-known and \nestablished class of officials (11:30), and came into greater \nprominence in association with the apostles (15:2). With the \n\"brethren\" they constituted the council at Jerusalem to which was \nreferred the question of circumcision, and they united with the \napostles and the church in sending to Antioch and other churches \ndelegates who should convey the decision of the council (15:22-23). \nWhen Paul visited Jerusalem for the last time he went in to James, \nthe president, where he found all the elders assembled (21:18-25). \nThe \"elders\" of the NT church were the \"pastors\" (Eph 4:11), \n\"overseers\" (Acts 20:28; etc.), the leaders who \"have charge\" (Heb \n13:7; 1 Thess 5:12; etc.) of the flock. They were also the regular \nteachers of the congregation, whose duty it was to expound the \nScriptures and administer the sacraments (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:9). The \nJewish Christians, following the pattern of the synagogue as well as \nof political administration of cities, which was vested in a senate \nor college, readily adopted the presbytery. Consequently we meet it \neverywhere in the plural, as a corporation at Jerusalem (Acts 11:30; \n15:4,6,23; 21:18), at Ephesus (20:17,28), at Philippi (Phil 1:1), at \nthe ordination of Timothy (1 Tim 4:14; etc.).\u0014\n\u0014\n(from The New Unger's Bible Dictionary. Originally published by Moody \nPress of Chicago, Illinois. Copyright  1988.)\u0014\n\u0014\nELDER\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The essential identity of presbyters and bishops in the apostolic \nage is a matter of well nigh absolute historic demonstration. The \nsame officers of the church of Ephesus are alternately called \npresbyters and bishops. Paul sends greetings to the bishops and \ndeacons of Philippi, but omits the presbyters because they were \nincluded in the first term, as also the plural indicates. In the \npastoral epistles, when Paul intends to give the qualifications for \nall church officers he again mentions two, bishops and deacons, but \nthe term presbyters afterward for bishops. Peter urges the presbyters \nto 'tend the flock of God, and to fulfill the office of bishops,' \nwith disinterested devotion and without lording it over the charge \nallotted them. The interchange of terms continued in use to the close \nof the 1st century, as is evident from the epistle of Clement of Rome \n(about 95 A.D.), and still lingered toward the close of the second\" \n(Schaff, Hist. Christ. Church). The reason for the use of two terms \nfor persons having the same essential functions has given rise to \nmuch discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo general suggestions have been made: (1) The term presbyter has \nbeen claimed to be of Jewish derivation and to have been used at \nfirst only by Jewish-Christian congregations. In communities where a \nChristian church had sprung from the bosom of a local synagogue, and \nwas therefore chiefly under the control of Jewish tradition and \nthought, the term presbyter, which was the name of the governing body \nof the synagogue, would be naturally transferred to officers of \nsimilar function in the Christian societies. It is likewise true that \nthe term bishop is used to designate one of like official duty in the \nchurches of almost exclusively Gentile origin. (2) A second theory is \nthat the bishop of the Christian church was analogous in office and \nfunction to that of the president of the pagan fraternities or clubs. \nTo administer the funds of these organizations became a matter of \nprimary importance, and the officer charged with this duty was termed \nan \"episcopos\".\u0014\n\u0014\nThe peculiar environment of the first Christian believers compelled \nlike provision for the exercise of systematic charities. Most of the \nearly disciples were of the poorer class, and many more, upon \nprofession of the Christian faith, became outcasts from their \nfamilies and homes.\u0014\n\u0014\n(from The New Unger's Bible Dictionary.

    "words": "October 25, 2012 New York Times\u0014\nOfficer Held in Plot to Cook Women and Eat Them\u0014\n\u0014\nBy JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police officer referred to the woman as Victim-1, recording \ndetails like her date of birth, height, weight and bra size. He made \nnote of certain materials, like chloroform and rope. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then the officer, Gilberto Valle, a six-year veteran of the New \nYork Police Department, saved the document in his computer, entitling \nthe file, Abducting and Cooking (Victim-1): A Blueprint. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of the most disturbing and unusual arrests involving a police \nofficer, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents took Officer Valle \ninto custody on Wednesday, after they uncovered several of his plots \nto kidnap, rape, cook and eat women. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was thinking of tying her body onto some kind of apparatus, he \nwrote to a co-conspirator in one electronic communication intercepted \nby law enforcement authorities. Cook her over a low heat, keep her \nalive as long as possible. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the co-conspirator asked how big the officers oven was, Officer \nValle replied, Big enough to fit one of these girls if I folded \ntheir legs. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe criminal complaint suggests that Officer Valle, who worked in the \n26th Precinct in Manhattan and lives in Forest Hills, Queens, never \nfollowed through on any of the acts he is accused of discussing. He \nwas charged with federal kidnapping conspiracy, and was expected to \nappear in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday afternoon. \u0014\n\u0014\nOfficer Valle, 28, is married. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe allegations in the complaint really need no description from \nus, Mary E. Galligan, the F.B.I.s acting assistant director, said \nin a statement. They speak for themselves. It would be an \nunderstatement merely to say Valles own words and actions were \nshocking. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe evidence consists largely of e-mails and instant messages in \nwhich he was discussing plans to kidnap, rape, torture, kill, cook \nand eat body parts of a number of women, according to the complaint, \nwhich describes two separate episodes in which Officer Valle \ndiscussed abducting women. In each case it appears that the women \nknew the officer vaguely. And in at least one case, the officer \ngained access to the National Crime Information Center to get \ninformation about a third woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an episode in February, Officer Valle sent an online message to \nanother unnamed person in which he offered to kidnap a woman on the \npersons behalf for a price: $5,000 and she is all yours, the \nofficer wrote, according to the complaint. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust so that you know, she may be knocked out when I get her to \nyou, Officer Valle wrote, according to the criminal complaint. I \ndont know how long the solvent I am using will last but I have to \nknock her out to get her out of her apartment safely. \u0014\n\u0014\nOfficer Valle appeared to be under the impression that the person he \nwas communicating with intended to rape the woman, according to the \ncriminal complaint. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe will be alive, he wrote. Its a short drive to you. I think I \nwould rather not get involved in the rape. You paid for her. She is \nall yours and I dont want to be tempted the next time I abduct a \ngirl. \u0014\n\u0014\nOfficer Valle also wrote that he would not budge on his $5,000 price: \nLike I said this is very risky and will ruin my life if I am \ncaught. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the complaint does not identify the woman in question, F.B.I. \nagents later learned that cellphone tracking devices indicated that \nOfficer Valle had made or received phone calls on the block in \nManhattan where the woman lived. When an F.B.I. agent interviewed the \nwoman, she said she did not know Officer Valle well. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a search of the officers computer, federal investigators \ndiscovered files pertaining to at least 100 women, according to the \ncomplaint. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe F.B.I. has identified and interviewed 10 of these women, each of \nwhom has confirmed to the F.B.I. that Valle is known to her, the \ncomplaint said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the search, federal agents also discovered the document Officer \nValle had created that appeared to be a blueprint for abducting \nand cooking the woman he referred to as Victim-1, according to the \ncomplaint, which redacts the name of the victim. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 19, Officer Valle sent an instant message to the \nco-conspirator, indicating that he was meeting with the intended \nvictim three days later, according to the complaint. The victim, who \nwas interviewed in October by the F.B.I., said she had met the \nofficer that day at a restaurant for lunch, according to the \ncomplaint. What happened during or after the lunch was not disclosed.\u0014",

    "title": "ON BATHING A CAT",
    "words": "Some people say cats never have to be bathed. They say cats lick \nthemselves clean. They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in \ntheir saliva that works like new, improved Wisk-dislodging the dirt \nwhere it hides and whisking it away.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind \nbelievers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary, \nthe kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt \nsmudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe time comes, however, when a man must face reality, when he must \nlook squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary \nand announce: \"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in \nJuarez.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen that day arrives at your house, as it has at mine, I have some \nadvice you might consider as you place your feline friend under your \narm and head for the bathtub:\u0014\n\u0014\n Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack \nof concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. \nCapitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try \nto bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. \nPick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet \nsquare, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close \nthe sliding-glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A \nsimple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a \nthree-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift \npositions.)\u0014\n\u0014\n Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the \nskin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and \nknow how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls \ntucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, \nan army helmet, a hockey face mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.\u0014\n\u0014\n Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a \ntowel when you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw \nthe water. Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass \nenclosure. Make sure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying \non your back in the water.\u0014\n\u0014\n Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to \nsimply carry him to his supper dish. Cats will not usually notice \nyour strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a \nrule.\u0014\n\u0014\n Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In \na single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub \nenclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and \nsquirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest minutes of \nyour life.\u0014\n\u0014\n Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and \nthe problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him \nfor more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, \nhowever, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and \nrub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, \nthereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three \nlatherings, so don't expect too much.)\u0014\n\u0014\n Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers assume this part \nwill be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this \npoint and the cat is just getting determined. In fact, the drying is \nsimple, compared to what you have just been through. That's because \nnow the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. Simply pop \nthe drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. \n(Occasionally, however, the cat will cling to the top of your army \nhelmet. If this happens, the best thing to do is shake him loose and \nencourage him toward your leg.) After the water is drained from the \ntub, simply reach down and dry the cat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. \nHe will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will \nspend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even \nbecome psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster \nfigurine.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the \ncase. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your \ndefenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him \na bath.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at least now he smells a lot bet\u0014",

    "words": "December 21, 2012,New York Times \u0014\n\u0014\nOur Family Christmas, Rescinded\u0014\n\u0014\nBy HEATHER HAVRILESKY\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago, my mother announced that she was spending \nChristmas in Egypt with friends. I flew home anyway, alone, and spent \ntwo days making homemade pierogies and sauerkraut and bread for the \ntraditional Carpatho-Rusyn meal we always have on Christmas Eve. At \n10 p.m., my sister had an hour off from her rounds at the hospital. \nShe came home and we ate. Then she left, and I did the dishes. \u0014\nYou might say I have a strong sense of tradition, if you didnt \nrecognize the heavy press of bereavement on these proceedings, the \nfear that the past is lost forever. The possible ranks higher than \nthe actual, Martin Heidegger wrote. Our visions of an ideal holiday \nerase our memories of the opposite. Like elephants, we return to the \nplace where something disappeared long ago, hoping to get that old \nfeeling back. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis compulsive pursuit of the past also explains why, when my mom \ncalled to tell me she didnt want me to stay with her over Christmas \nthis year, I felt it must be some misunderstanding. Im 70 years \nold, she explained. I dont have many Christmases left in me. I \ncant handle the chaos and the noise anymore. She offered to pay for \nme and my family to stay in a hotel instead. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts your house, I said finally of the place I (myopically) \nconsider mine more than any other. I imagined myself under a starched \nwhite sheet, listening to strangers come and go in a hotel hallway on \nChristmas Eve. You should do whatever you want, I said. Then I put \ndown the phone and cried. \u0014\n\u0014\nI could have protested her decision, but I knew that I would merely \nbe seen as playing to type, following the same pushy emotional script \nmy family has heard so many times before. Or, as my sister put it \nyears ago when I moved in with yet another boyfriend, Same old \nstory, different year. We want our comforting traditions to stay \nsuspended in sap while our families constantly revise their \nunderstanding of us like software that updates automatically. \nInstead, traditions crumble and nostalgia yields to melancholy, but \nour identities, to our families, are as fixed and stagnant as fossils \nbehind glass. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnxious to demonstrate how mature and flexible weve become, we \nreturn to our birthplaces and were cut down to size, encountered as \npredictable once again. Disappointment and longing well up on a \nlast-minute trip to the shopping mall, haunted by the mournful \nstrains of Perry Comos White Christmas. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe I just wish I were little again. As a parent, Im expected to \nsmile serenely as I pour the wine and rush the baked rolls to the \ntable, as I sign Santa on every package, then join my children in \nmarveling at his generosity. Id rather be one of the kids, tearing \ninto presents, then gloating over my loot like a drunken pirate. \nPerhaps nostalgia is a natural result of being abruptly ushered from \nthe realm of gleeful greed to the less-thrilling arena of sweating \nthe small stuff, then receding into the background until its time to \ncrawl across the floor retrieving stray scraps of wrapping paper. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy moms insistence on spending Christmas in an empty house might be \nher way of finally rejecting this farce. For decades now, my brother \nand I have returned home specifically to regress, to slouch around in \ndirty socks, eating Christmas cookies, ignoring my moms soliloquies \non how little time she has left. Lately we have dragged our spouses \nand unruly children along with us. What I perceived as abandonment \ncould be my moms attempt to offer an Its a Wonderful Life-style \ntour of what life would look like without her. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe my mothers growing acceptance of her mortality has emancipated \nher from old obligations. Or maybe shes just eager to shock us out \nof our childish selfishness. Either way, it worked. We can see now \nthat, without her, we are greedy babies surrounded by other greedy \nbabies, waiting expectantly for the dinner bell to ring. We want to \ndeny that theres an end to this story, so we remain trapped. My \nmother, though, is free to forge a new path, unburdened by the decay \nof history. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut well all come together again on Christmas Eve, the trapped and \nthe free, to endure the noise and the chaos. The possible ranks \nhigher than the actual. Im really looking forward to it. \u0014\n\u0014\nHeather Havrilesky is the author of a memoir, Disaster Preparedness.\u0014",

    "words": "We're so conditioned to speaking of God in masculine terms, it is \noften jarring to hear someone use \"Mother God\" or \"She\" to speak of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, when we use only masculine imagery and pronouns to refer to God, \nwe omit the balance of God's feminine nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago, I read William Paul Young's wonderful religious \nnovel, \"The Shack.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung has been criticized for imaging the Trinity as three completely \nseparate human characters. But my favorite part was when he \nintroduced the God-figure, an African-American female cook named \nPapa. (Talk about scrambling stereotypes!)\u0014\n\u0014\nWe actually have a bigger problem than using masculine references for \nGod or substituting feminine references.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we think of God only in terms of humanlike qualities, we limit \nour understanding of God's complex nature because God's character \nencompasses so much more than personhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo broaden our understanding of God, we might intentionally lay aside \nfor a while any humanlike references such as: He, Him, His, Father, \nLord, Master, King, She, Her, Mother, Parent, Ruler.\u0014\nInstead, we might speak of God using terms that highlight other \naspects of God's character such as:\u0014\nNames: God, Yahweh, Jehovah, I AM, Divine Spirit and Maker.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdjectives: Holy, Creator, Loving, Heavenly, Mighty, Good, Great, \nWorthy, Defending, Deliverer, Redeeming, Worthy, Perfect, All Wise, \nAll Knowing and Cosmic.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, changing our verbiage will change our thinking and \nliving.

    "title": "ONE MAN BRINGS HALT TO GLADITORIAL GAMES IN ROME",
    "words": "There is a marvelous little story tucked away in the pages of Edward \nGibbon's seven-volume work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. \nIt tells about a humble little monk named Telemachus living out in \nthe farming regions of Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTelemachus had no great ambitions in life. He loved his little garden \nand tilled it through the changing seasons. But one day in the year \n391 he felt a sense of urgency, a call of God's direction in his \nlife. Although he didn't know why, he felt that God wanted him to go \nto Rome, the heart and soul of the empire. In fact the feelings of \nsuch a call frightened him, but he went anyway, praying along the way \nfor God's direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he finally got to the city, it was in an uproar! The armies of \nRome had just come home from the battlefield in victory, and the \ncrowds were turning out for a great celebration. They flowed through \nthe streets like a tidal wave, and Telemachus was caught in their \nfrenzy and carried into the Coliseum.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had never seen a gladiator contest before, but now his heart \nsickened. Down in the arena men hacked at each other with swords and \nclubs. The crowds roared at the sight of blood and urged their \nfavorites on to the death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTelemachus couldn't stand it. He knew it was wrong; this wasn't the \nway God wanted people to live or to die. So little Telemachus worked \nhis way through the crowds to the wall down by the arena. \"In the \nname of Christ, forbear!\" he shouted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNobody heard him, so he crawled up onto the wall and shouted again: \n\"In the name of Christ, forbear!\" This time the few who heard him \nonly laughed. But Telemachus was not to be ignored. He jumped into \nthe arena and ran through the sands toward the gladiators. \"In the \nname of Christ, forbear!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowds laughed at the silly little man and threw stones at him. \nTelemachus, however, was on a mission. He threw himself between two \ngladiators to stop their fighting. \"In the name of Christ, forbear!\" \nhe cried.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThey hacked him apart! They cut his body from shoulder to stomach, \nand he fell onto the sand with the blood running out of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gladiators were stunned and stopped to watch him die. Then the \ncrowds fell back in silence, and for a moment no one in the Coliseum \nmoved. Telemachus' final words rang in their memories: \"In the name \nof Christ, forbear!\" At last they moved, slowly at first, but growing \nin numbers. The masses of Rome filed out of the Coliseum that day, \nand the historian Theodoret reports that never again was a gladiator \ncontest held there! All because of the witness and the testimony of a \nsingle Christian!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe power of a faithful witness carries great impact. The disciples \nof Jesus modeled that in the pages of Acts, as we read about it \ntoday. They were only taking their cue from Jesus himself, the \nfaithful witness who appeared to John, and remembered when the \nwitness of Jesus and the witness of those who followed him were \nwrapped up in a single incident in which all were bound together by \nthe Holy Spirit. We are witnesses...\u0014",

    "title": "OBEYING GOD'S WORD WHEN IT SUITS THEM",
    "words": "Jim Evans\u0014\nApril 25, 2010   Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Georgia, Baptists are quarreling about women preachers. One \nchurch, First Baptist of Decatur, where Julie Pennington-Russell is \npastor, has already been removed from the ranks of what is known as a \n\"cooperating church\" by the local association. Another church, Druid \nHills in Atlanta, may be facing the same fate although in the Druid \nHills case the issue is a husband-and-wife pastor team. \u0014\n\u0014\nBehind it all is a single biblical verse found in the first letter to \nTimothy. The verse reads, \"I do not permit a woman to teach or \nexercise authority over a man, but to remain silent.\" Those 18 words \nhave slammed the door on women preachers for a long time. When you \ntalk to Baptist leaders, and ask what women who feel called are \nsupposed to do, they shrug and say, \"It's God's word. We just have to \naccept it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny thing about God's word  sometimes it appears that there is a \nlittle picking and choosing going on. For instance in the verses that \nfollow the so-called prohibition against women preachers, there are \nalso some very strong words about how women should dress and wear \ntheir hair. These words are rarely if ever enforced in any Baptist \nchurch I know about.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are other examples. In the Book of Leviticus, there is a \nprohibition against eating pork, catfish and shrimp. My experience \nhas been that these are three of the main food groups at most church \npicnics.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd don't get me started on the wholesale ignoring of the teachings \nof Jesus about taking care of the poor. Nearly a third of Matthew 25 \nis devoted to warning believers that our failure to take care of the \nleast of these in our midst is a testimony that we do not know Jesus \nat all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are also some contradictions within the Scriptures that are \nconveniently ignored. For instance, while it appears that Paul \nprohibits women from preaching in the Timothy passage, in 1 \nCorinthians he gives detailed information about how women should \ndress when they are preaching. Which Paul do we listen to?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt another time in our history, Bible believers clutched holy writ \nand helped plunge us into a bloody civil war. Even Christians who did \nnot own slaves felt they had to defend slavery because the Bible \nstates, \"slaves be obedient to your masters.\" Paul, again, by the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case of slavery, what eventually happened is that the Spirit \nof Christ triumphed over the letter of the Bible. I don't know anyone \nwho on the basis of biblical authority would say that slavery is \nacceptable or is in some way part of God's plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am hoping this will be the course taken with women preachers. That \nmany women experience a sense of calling and possess great gifts for \nministry is beyond dispute. What needs to happen is for the \nprevailing male authorities to listen to the Spirit of Christ moving \nthrough the church and allow that Spirit to triumph over the letter \nof the letter.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the biblically faithful are well intended, by embracing the \nBible literally on this issue, they are standing as an impediment to \nGod's working in our world. There were many centuries in the early \nchurch where leaders had to rely on the Spirit alone  the New \nTestament had not been written yet. That same spiritual sensitivity \nhas the potential to hear beyond the literal word and hopefully open \npulpits to everyone God is calling.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans is pastor of Auburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, \nAla.\u0014",

    "words": "When Louis Pasteur was researching the deadly anthrax virus, he found \nthat once a cow that had the disease recovered, it could never die \nfrom anthrax. It was immune.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur faith can also develop a kind of immunity. If our faith \ndemonstrates that itself in commitment, exercises itself in moral \nhabits, and reaches out for the power offered in scripture and in the \nchurch, then it cannot be easily lost when life gets tough.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's why we need to make small commitments of faith when we're \nyoung. Imagine, as Harry Emerson Fosdick did, that life is a journey \ndown the banks of the Jordan River. At some time before we die, we \nneed to cross the river and take up residence in the Promised Land.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the church, we often direct attention to the lower end of the \nriver, to the wild surge of waves just before the Jordan empties \nitself into the Dead Sea. Standing on the banks of the Promised Land, \nwe look across at those urging them to come into the grace of God \nbefore it's too late. Many step into the roaring waters and try to \nswim. Sometimes they struggle across, nearly exhausted by the effort. \nSometimes they don't make it. They get lost among the waves, and the \nwaters close in around them. Their hands reach out for help, but it \nappears to be too late.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut people can easily cross the Jordan earlier than that. They can \ncross midstream, where the current is weaker. They can even wade \nacross near its source at the Sea of Galilee, where the waters are \nshallow and trickle slowly.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who cross the river near its source are like those who make \nearly commitments of faith, who are drawn to a life of faith by the \nfirm hands of parents, teachers, and friends. Isn't it wonderful that \nthey can now walk for a lifetime on the shores of the Promised Land \nand know faith's preventative power during the rough times?\u0014",

    "words": "Our Society's Hero \nWorship of Athletes \u0014\n\u0014\nPhillip Larsen\u0014\nPosted: Monday, October 28, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nI graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2006, so I was \nfortunate enough to see Adrian Peterson burst onto the scene. \u0014\n\u0014\nI remember watching Peterson's first collegiate game against the \nmighty Bowling Green State University Falcons, standing (because you \ndon't sit in the student section) with a friend watching this \nspecimen of athleticism. He was a great Sooner and is a phenomenal \nathlete and running back.\u0014\n\u0014\nCountless stories have been written about the terrific football \nseason he had last year, less than a year removed from major knee \nsurgery.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an avid fantasy football player, I owe Peterson a huge thank-you \nfor carrying so many of my teams to victory in my fantasy football \nleague.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike a lot of people, I was saddened to hear about the death of \nPeterson's 2-year-old son. As a father, that is the nightmare \nscenario. My stomach turns just thinking about what I would do and \nhow I would react if I lost one of my girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe outpouring of support for Peterson was well documented throughout \nthe sports world. I mourn with Adrian and the mother of the child for \ntheir loss. I weep for the loss of a child. However, Peterson is no \nhero, which the story surrounding his son's death proves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the emotional reaction began to subside and the truth about \nPeterson's behavior as a father began to surface, it became clear \nthat Peterson, although a superstar athlete, was no hero.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Peterson had only met his 2-year-old son two months \nprior to his death reveals that Peterson does not deserve the status \nof hero that we are so quick to bestow on him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince this tragedy, further stories have surfaced that Peterson has \nhad multiple kids with multiple women.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one hand, I think we have set ourselves up for failure when we \nmistakenly translated incredible athletic ability with morality.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of our expectations for our professional athletes are \nunrealistic. I have written previously about how it is unfair that we \nplaced so much weight and expectation on Tim Tebow in a blog that I \nwrote in January 2012.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, this serves as an opportunity to re-evaluate our \npriorities. Our heroes are not NFL running backs or other \nprofessional athletes.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur heroes are fathers who take time to lead their households. Our \nheroes are parents who take the time to frankly talk about God's \npurpose for spiritual health, sex, work and many of the other \npressing issues of our day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur heroes are fathers and mothers, pastors and teachers, and all of \nthose who invest in one another and in all things that point to \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is OK to continue to watch Peterson, to root for him to do well \nand to have him on your fantasy football team.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is not OK is to make Peterson  or any other athlete  something \nthat he is not: a replacement for the true heroes in our lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhillip Larsen is a member of West Metro Community Church in Yukon, \nOkla.\u0014",

    "title": "ONCE THRIVING CITY REDUCED TO RUIN IN PHILIPPINES",
    "words": "Once-Thriving City Is Reduced \nto Ruin in Philippines\u0014\n\u0014\nBy KEITH BRADSHER   November 11, 2013  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nTACLOBAN, Philippines  The largest storm surge in modern history in \nthe Philippines sent walls of water over half a mile inland along a \ncrowded coastline when Typhoon Haiyan came ashore here last Friday, \nerasing villages and towns and leaving thousands of people dead or \nmissing. \u0014\n\u0014\nShattered buildings line every road of this once-thriving city of \n220,000, and many of the streets are still so clogged with debris \nfrom nearby buildings that they are barely discernible. The civilian \nairport terminal here has shattered walls and gaping holes in the \nroof where steel beams protrude, twisted and torn by winds far more \npowerful than those of Hurricane Katrina when it made landfall near \nNew Orleans in 2005. \u0014\n\u0014\nDecomposing bodies still lie along the roads, like the corpse in a \npink, short-sleeved shirt and blue shorts facedown in a puddle 100 \nyards from the airport. Just down the road lies a church that was \nsupposed to be an evacuation center but is littered with the bodies \nof those who drowned inside. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe top civil defense official of the Philippines said in an \ninterview after inspecting the damage that the storm surge had been \nthe highest in the countrys modern history. The sea level rose 10 to \n13 feet and filled streets and homes deep in the city, propelled by \nsustained winds of at least 140 miles per hour and gusts that were \nfar stronger. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a tsunami-like storm surge, it is the first time, said \nEduardo del Rosario, the executive director of the National Disaster \nRisk Reduction and Management Council, in an interview after \ninspecting the damage here. Tacloban has been hit by typhoons for \ndecades, but never before had the sea risen high enough to pour over \nthe swath of low salt marshes and inundate the citys shady streets, \nhe said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a violet sunset melted on Monday evening into the nearly total \ndarkness of a city without electricity, lighted only by a waxing half \nmoon, dispirited residents walked home after another day of waiting \nat the airport in hope of fresh water, food or a flight out. Looters \nsacked groceries and pharmacies across the city over the weekend, \nleaving bare shelves for a population now quickly growing hungry and \nthirsty. \u0014\n\u0014\nMiriam Refugio, 60, waited in the crowd of Filipinos at the airport \nseeking a scarce place on a flight to Manila. Our home was \ndestroyed, there is no food in this town, so we have to flee, she \nsaid, standing with her teenage granddaughter who held their only \ndrinking water, a nearly empty plastic bottle that even when full \nwould only hold perhaps two cups. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were trying to decide whether to drink water from a nearby pump, \neven though the granddaughter, tugging at her stomach for emphasis, \nsaid that they were certain to become sick if they did. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. del Rosario said the government was still sending out helicopters \non Monday to look for communities that had not been heard from since \nthe typhoon. The government had confirmed 1,563 deaths through Sunday \nevening in the hardest-hit region of the east-central Philippines, \nand the death toll will most likely rise, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut one of the biggest questions here involves the many people who \nseem to have disappeared, possibly sucked out to sea when the ocean \nreturned to its usual level. \u0014\n\u0014\nRosemary Balais, 39, said that a very large proportion, possibly more \nthan half, of the 5,000 people in her hometown Tanauan, near \nTacloban, seemed to be missing. My sister and their children were \nthere and we have not heard from them since last Thursday, she said, \nadding that they had lived only around 300 yards inland from the \ncoast. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a neighbor who had won a lottery and had a big house, and \neven that house was flattened, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nCompounding the damage was the extraordinary force of the wind. Palm \ntrees are naturally resilient, flexing and bending in high winds. But \nentire groves were flattened and their trunks left in tangles on the \nground as though giant boxes of toothpicks had been tipped over. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a country cursed with a succession of natural disasters, from \nearthquakes to violent storms to volcanic eruptions, the typhoon has \nemerged as especially deadly and destructive. Its going to be \nclassified as one of the worst, if not the worst, in decades, among \ndisasters that have struck the Philippines, said Ricky Carandang, a \npresidential spokesman.\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: NOte in tbhis article than a man had just won the lottery and in \na matter of days lost everything in the storm.\u0014",

    "words": "Only 14, Bangladeshi girl charged with \nadultery was lashed to death\u0014\n\u0014\nDarbesh Khan and his wife, Aklima Begum, had to watch their youngest \ndaughter being whipped until she dropped.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHena Akhter, in her last words to her mother, said she was innocent\u0014\n\tAt first, an autopsy said she committed suicide\u0014\n\tBut later, the ugly details of her case surfaced\u0014\n\tHer family says she was punished twice -- raped and then lashed\u0014\n\u0014\nShariatpur, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Hena Akhter's last words to her \nmother proclaimed her innocence. But it was too late to save the \n14-year-old girl.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer fellow villagers in Bangladesh's Shariatpur district had already \npassed harsh judgment on her. Guilty, they said, of having an affair \nwith a married man. The imam from the local mosque ordered the fatwa, \nor religious ruling, and the punishment: 101 lashes delivered \nswiftly, deliberately in public. \u0014\nHena dropped after 70.\u0014\n\u0014\nBloodied and bruised, she was taken to hospital, where she died a \nweek later.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmazingly, an initial autopsy report cited no injuries and deemed her \ndeath a suicide. Hena's family insisted her body be exhumed. They \nwanted the world to know what really happened to their daughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nSharia: illegal but still practiced\u0014\n\u0014\nHena's family hailed from rural Shariatpur, crisscrossed by murky \nrivers that lend waters to rice paddies and lush vegetable fields.\u0014\n\u0014\nHena was the youngest of five children born to Darbesh Khan, a day \nlaborer, and his wife, Aklima Begum. They shared a hut made from \ncorrugated tin and decaying wood and led a simple life that was \nsuddenly marred a year ago with the return of Hena's cousin Mahbub \nKhan.\u0014\nMahbub Khan came back to Shariatpur from a stint working in Malaysia. \nHis son was Hena's age and the two were in seventh grade together.\u0014\n\u0014\nKhan eyed Hena and began harassing her on her way to school and back, \nsaid Hena's father. He complained to the elders who run the village \nabout his nephew, three times Hena's age. \u0014\nThe elders admonished Mahbub Khan and ordered him to pay $1,000 in \nfines to Hena's family. But Mahbub was Darbesh's older brother's son \nand Darbesh was asked to let the matter fade.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany months later on a winter night, as Hena's sister Alya told it, \nHena was walking from her room to an outdoor toilet when Mahbub Khan \ngagged her with cloth, forced her behind nearby shrubbery and beat \nand raped her.\u0014\n\u0014\nHena struggled to escape, Alya told CNN. Mahbub Khan's wife heard \nHena's muffled screams and when she found Hena with her husband, she \ndragged the teenage girl back to her hut, beat her and trampled her \non the floor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next day, the village elders met to discuss the case at Mahbub \nKhan's house, Alya said. The imam pronounced his fatwa. Khan and Hena \nwere found guilty of an illicit relationship. Her punishment under \nsharia or Islamic law was 101 lashes; his 201.\u0014\n\u0014\nMahbub Khan managed to escape after the first few lashes.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarbesh Khan and Aklima Begum had no choice but to mind the imam's \norder. They watched as the whip broke the skin of their youngest \nchild and she fell unconscious to the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What happened to Hena is unfortunate and we all have to be ashamed \nthat we couldn't save her life,\" said Sultana Kamal, who heads the \nrights organization Ain o Shalish Kendro.\u0014\n\u0014\nBangladesh is considered a democratic and moderate Muslim country, \nand national law forbids the practice of sharia. But activist and \njournalist Shoaib Choudhury, who documents such cases, said sharia is \nstill very much in use in villages and towns aided by the lack of \neducation and strong judicial systems.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Supreme Court also outlawed fatwas a decade ago, but human rights \nmonitors have documented more than 500 cases of women in those 10 \nyears who were punished through a religious ruling. And few who have \nissued such rulings have been charged.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/Only 14, Bangladeshi girl \nlashed to death.\u0014",

    "title": "ODE TO JIMMY CARTER - BY LAUREN WINNER",
    "words": "Jesus sounds somewhat extreme here. What might it mean to take these \nsomewhat extreme words seriously? What might it mean to take \nseriously the idea that your thoughts and emotions matter and that \nyour thoughts and emotions can themselves partake deeply of sin?\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorical precedent suggests that when you take that notion \nseriously, you get ridiculed. Hence the title of this sermon, Ode to \nJimmy Carter.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was born three weeks before Carter was elected to the White House, \nso everything I know about the 1976 presidential campaign has come to \nme as a history lesson: Carters use of the peanut as a way of \nsignaling that he was not a Washington insider; the key role Carters \nvictory in the North Carolina primary played in getting George \nWallace out of national politics for good; and, of course, Carters \nill-fated interview with Playboy magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked, at the tail end of the interview, the umpteenth question \nabout whether his firmly held Baptist religious convictions would \nunduly influence his policy decisions in the White House, Carter \nbegan opining about grace, and about sin, and he quoted this \nmornings Gospel reading.\u0014\n\u0014\nI try not to commit a deliberate sin. I recognize that Im going to \ndo it anyhow, because Im human and Im tempted. And Christ set some \nalmost impossible standards for us. Christ said, I tell you that \nanyone who looks on a woman with lust has in his heart already \ncommitted adultery. Ive looked on a lot of women with lust. Ive \ncommitted adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God \nrecognizes I will doand I have done itand God forgives me for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter had a big lead before this interview, but when choice \nquotations leaked to the press, even before the interview was \npublished, he dropped 15 points in the polls. Evangelicals and \nfeminists were, for different reasons, horrified that Carter had \nspoken to Playboy in the first place, and everyone else, especially \nNortherners, mocked him for his piety and his lame attempt to sound \nlike he was connecting with the common man by admitting the lust in \nhis heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical cartoonists had a field day.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of making him seem like an average Joe, the governors \ncomments about lust and adultery actually reinforced peoples opinion \nthat Carter was way too pious and way too priggish and took Jesus way \ntoo seriously. I mean, really, confessing that you have lustful \nthoughts as though it were a sina serious sin, on par with actually \nhaving an affair? Please.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurely we are not supposed to take these hyperbolic and demanding \nthings Jesus is saying about murder and lust and false witness at \nface value. Surely it cannot be that thinking a mean thought about \nsomeone is the equivalent of murdering her. Surely our thoughtsthe \nthoughts we keep to ourselves and never even speak of, much less act \nonsurely those thoughts are less important than our actions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in addition to being less important than actions, surely also \nthoughts are less controllable than actions: I can prevent myself \nfrom sleeping with that woman I met at the conference last week, but \nI cant reasonably be held responsible for daydreaming about her \nafter Ive returned home.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus and Jimmy Carterand I pair the two together in the least \npartisan way possibleJesus and Jimmy Carter seem to suggest \nsomething different.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnderneath the specifics of murder and adultery and bearing false \nwitness, Jesus seems to be suggesting that we are capable of \ndisciplining our thoughts, at least as capable as we are of \ndisciplining our bodies; and Jesus seems to be suggesting that what \nhappens in our thoughts and imaginations matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps todays Gospel passage is inviting each of us to give up a \nthought. Consider renouncing the angry thoughts about your \nmother-in-law. Consider renouncing the escapist daydreams about \nleaving your wife and running off with your next-door neighbor. \nConsider renouncing the jealous thoughts about your faculty \ncolleague, who seems to have a nicer office than you, and a cozier \nrelationship with your dean. Renounce those thoughts, because Jesus \ntold us that they are the equivalent of murder and adultery. Renounce \nthem to make a different kind of space in your brain for God, for \ncharity, for love, for whatever magical thing you might uncover when \nyou set aside the anger and the lust and the fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know how this renouncing will work out for you, but I want \nyou to try it before you toss it aside on the pile we all keep, that \npile called things Jesus says to do but we know no one possibly \ncould.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading Jesus words over the last few weeks, it struck me that, at \nthe moment, my crazy destructive thoughts involve not mostly anger or \nlust but fear.\u0014",

    "words": "Oklahoma Senator Uses Genesis Scripture to Support Marijuana \nLegalization\u0014\n\u0014\nCarrie Dedrick | Editor, ChristianHeadlines.com | Monday, June 16, \n2014 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Oklahoma senator is using a scripture from the book of Genesis to \nback her claim that marijuana should be legalized in the state. Sen. \nConstance Johnson has cited Genesis 1:29 as a reason to legalize pot. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe scripture states, Then God said, I give you every seed-bearing \nplant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit \nwith seed in it. They will be yours for food. Johnson interprets \nthe scripture to mean God made the plant so it should be legal for \nuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere putting forth Genesis 1:29 as the basis of this campaign, \nJohnson said. God created this wonderful, miraculous plant and we \nknow that is has been vilified for the last 100 years, and its time \nto change that in Oklahoma. \u0014\n\u0014\nA petition is currently going around Oklahoma to put the marijuana \nproposal on a state ballot. Under Johnsons proposal, one ounce of \nmarijuana would be legal for recreational use; three ounces would be \npermissible for medical use. \u0014\n\u0014\nWeve experienced anything from downright disregard to ignoring us \nto telling us to, Go to hell pretty much. And this is where weve \nhad to go. Were taking this to a vote of the people because we know \nthe people of the State of Oklahoma, in spite of what the \npolicymakers refuse to do, want to have a voice on this matter. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts just the right thing to do. Its a God given plant and it could \nchange the world, said Johnson.\u0014",

    "words": "\"Obamacare haters, your case just got weaker,\" \u0014\nsaid Jonathan Cohn in NewRepublic.com. A \u0014\nCommonwealth Fund study revealed last week \u0014\nthat about 9.5 million fewer adults are uninsured \u0014\nthan when open enrollment in the Affordable \u0014\nCare Act's exchanges began last fall. Many of \u0014\nthese adults had purchased subsidized insurance \u0014\nunder Obamacare or enrolled in \"the newly \u0014\nexpanded Medicaid program.\" Even better, \u0014\nthey are satisfied customers, regardless of their \u0014\npolitics: Even 74 percent of Republicans are \u0014\nhappy with their new coverage. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe ACA has \u0014\nfaced nonstop \"predictions of disaster\" from \u0014\nconservatives, said Paul Krugman in The New \u0014\nYork Times, \"none of which have come true.\" \u0014\nEnrollment has surged past White House targets, \u0014\nand most people have bought policies on the \u0014\nexchanges at low or reasonable cost. \"The usual \u0014\nsuspects will keep crying failure, but the truth is \u0014\nthat health reform is-gasp!-working.\" \u0014\nObamacare supporters are playing \"fast and \u0014\nloose with the numbers,\" said Chris Conover in \u0014\nForbes.com. The Commonwealth survey has a \u0014\n\"hefty\" margin of error, so the uninsured rate \u0014\ncould have fallen by only 5.5 million people, not \u0014\n9.5 million. Meanwhile, insurers are about to\u0014\ndrop an Obamacare bomb, said Philip Klein in \u0014\nWashingtonExaminer.com. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Pricewaterhouse \u0014\nCoopers survey of 18 states found that the cost \u0014\nof policies could increase by an average of more \u0014\nthan 7 percent next year. Those costs will be \u0014\nshouldered by middle class families who don't \u0014\nqualify for ACA subsidies, and younger and \u0014\nhealthier patients forced to accept comprehensive \u0014\ncoverage they don't need and can't afford. Yes, \u0014\nObamacare has left some better off, but there are \u0014\nmany losers under the law, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the catastrophe conservatives predicted \u0014\nhasn't occurred, said Ezra Klein in Vox. com. \u0014\nIndeed, many more insurance companies are join- \u0014\ning the exchanges in 2015, and the ACA will only \u0014\nimprove as competition increases and the bugs \u0014\nare worked out. But is that really \"a defeat for \u0014\nconservatism\"? No. The ACA was based on some \u0014\n\"pretty conservative ideas,\" including expand- \u0014\ning health coverage through market-oriented \u0014\nexchanges of private insurers. Indeed, if Obama- \u0014\ncare succeeds, it would kill the \"liberal dream\" of \u0014\na national single-payer system. Years after Presi- \u0014\ndent Obama has left office, Republicans are going \u0014\nto look back on his signature health-care policy \t6 \u0014\n\"and find quite a bit to like.\" \t]\u0014",

This does not mean I am finished \nwith life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the \ntime that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those \nI love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve \nnew levels of understanding and insight.\u0014\n\u0014\nI feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for \nanything inessential. I must focus on myself, my work and my friends. \nI shall no longer look at NewsHour every night. I shall no longer \npay any attention to politics or arguments about global warming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not indifference but detachment  I still care deeply about \nthe Middle East, about global warming, about growing inequality, but \nthese are no longer my business; they belong to the future. I rejoice \nwhen I meet gifted young people  even the one who biopsied and \ndiagnosed my metastases. I feel the future is in good hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have been increasingly conscious, for the last 10 years or so, of \ndeaths among my contemporaries. My generation is on the way out, and \neach death I have felt as an abruption, a tearing away of part of \nmyself. There will be no one like us when we are gone, but then there \nis no one like anyone else, ever. When people die, they cannot be \nreplaced. They leave holes that cannot be filled, for it is the fate \n the genetic and neural fate  of every human being to be a unique \nindividual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his \nown death.\u0014\n\u0014\nI cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one \nof gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and \nI have given something in return; I have read and traveled and \nthought and written. I have had an intercourse with the world, the \nspecial intercourse of writers and readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbove all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this \nbeautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege \nand adventure.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOliver Sacks, a professor of neurology at the New York University \nSchool of Medicine, is the author of many books, including \nAwakenings and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.\u0014",

    "title": "ORAL TRADITION AND THE BIBLE",
    "words": "What the Bible Is\u0014\nAugust 26, 2015 by Chuck Queen\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe written documents that constitute our Bible are snapshots of an \nevolving, developing, dynamic faith frozen in time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe faith exhibited in these written sources thrived in an oral \nculture that did not depend on written materials. Writing materials \nwere expensive and few could actually read and write. So the stuff of \nfaith  stories, poetry, wisdom sayings, etc.  were passed down \norally. This oral tradition was flexible, fluid, and easily adaptable \nto different situations and historical contexts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis process meant that faith was constantly on the move  changing, \ngrowing, branching out into new forms, and always finding fresh \nexpressions in different settings.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider one example: The various ways the Jesus saying, The first \nshall be last, and the last shall be first, is interpreted and \nemployed with other Jesus sayings in the Gospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Mark it occurs in a context where Jesus assures Peter that those \nwho have left much to be his followers will gain much,\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter began to say to him, Look, we have left everything and \nfollowed you. Jesus said, Truly I tell you, there is no one who has \nleft house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or \nfields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not \nreceive a hundredfold now in this age  houses, brothers and sisters, \nmothers and children, and fields with persecutions  and in the age \nto come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the \nlast will be first (Mark 10:28-31).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the parallel passage in Matthew 19:27-30, Matthew makes a \nsignificant alteration (redaction) of Marks version. In Matthew \nJesus begins by responding,\u0014\n\u0014\nTruly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man \nis seated on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will \nalso sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel \n(Matt. 19:28).\u0014\n\u0014\nNo such promise is made in Marks Gospel. Does Matthews statement \nreflect an actual historical promise made by Jesus of Nazareth which \nMark intentionally omits or didnt know about? Was this part of \nMatthews oral tradition or did Matthew create this saying to serve \nhis own theological purpose?\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew also omits Marks reference to persecutions. Marks Gospel \nwas probably written about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem \nby the Romans around 70 C.E. No doubt Marks Jewish followers of \nJesus were facing great opposition and suffering. By the time Matthew \nwas written (80 to 90 C.E.) the intensity of the earlier wave of \nRoman persecution would have subsided.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew 20:16 this saying shows up again in the parable of the \nlandowner (Matt. 20:1-16). The landowner hired day laborers at \nvarious intervals throughout the day. At the end of the day, \nbeginning with the last workers hired, the landowner paid each of the \nworkers the same wage. This meant that the first workers hired who \nbore the heat of the day were paid last and paid the same wage as \nthose who worked only one hour. They grumbled against the \nlandowner. Wouldnt you?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe landowner says to one of them,\u0014\n\u0014\nFriend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the \nusual daily wage? Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give \nto this last the same as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I \nchoose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am \ngenerous? (Matt. 20:13-15)\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in 20:16 the text says, So the last will be first, and the \nfirst will be last. Is this intended by Matthew to be the conclusion \nof the parable by Jesus or did Matthew include the saying here as his \nown interpretation of the parable?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis saying also appears in Lukes Gospel (written around the time of \nMatthew or possibly even later  90 to 100 C.E) in a judgment \ncontext. Lukes Gospel confronts national and religious \nexceptionalism (see Luke 4:16-30). In Luke 13:22-30 Jesus challenges \nthose who think their futures are secure because they belong to the \nright group. Jesus says to them,\u0014\n\u0014\nThere will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and \nIsaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you \nyourselves thrown out. Then people will come from east and west, from \nnorth and south, and will eat in the kingdom of God. Indeed, some are \nlast who will be first, and some are first who will be last (Luke \n13:28-30).\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice that here Mark and Matthews many is changed by Luke to \nsome  some are last who will be first, and some are first who \nwill be last. Why the change? We might also ask how much of the \npassage in Luke 13:22-30 actually goes back to Jesus and how much was \ncreatively added by Luke?\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, a form of this saying also shows up in the Gospel of Thomas \nin Logion 4:2, For many of the first will be last and will become a \nsingle one. An emphasis on oneness between God and humanity and \nwithin humanity was characteristic of the Christianity that \nflourished in Syria toward the latter part of the first century, \nwhich the Gospel of Thomas represents (see Logion 22, 23, 48, and \n106).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what does this one example from the Gospels demonstrate? Namely, \nthat the sayings, teachings, and stories attributed to Jesus, as well \nas stories about Jesus, were constantly in flux rather than fixed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is how oral tradition works. The early disciples were much more \ncreative than many Christians today  altering, changing, adapting, \nand appropriating the Jesus traditions in ever fresh and new ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nStephen J. Patterson, a scholar of Christian origins, describes the \nprocess this way,\u0014\n\u0014\nOral culture was more fragile [than cultures pervaded by written \ntexts]. Texts endure; the spoken word does not. Oral tradition relied \nfor survival on constant repetition and use. It had to be useful. If \nsomething was not useful, it was not repeated, and if not repeated, \nit very soon vanished. . . . The skilled sage was one who was able to \nrender things useful in new and ever-changing settings. Oral \ntradition was malleable. It had to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne may see this even in the literature of early Christianity. \nLiterature that comes from a predominantly oral culture behaves more \nor less like oral tradition itself. So when one compares a saying or \nparable of Jesus as it appears in two or more gospels, it is often \nstriking how differently it has been rendered. This is true of the \nstories about Jesus as well . . . . Each of the gospel writers also \nexercised great liberty and creativity with the tradition. This \nreflects quite simply the oral mentality of the ancient world. Things \nwere never simply repeated; they were repeated and interpreted.\\[1]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian Gospels give us a glimpse into the diverse ways the \nJesus traditions were appropriated by early Christian communities. \nThese traditions contain both echoes and memories of actual sayings \nand events in the life of the historical Jesus and creative \ntheological interpretations and proclamations of the living Christ by \nthese communities. The Gospels capture in time a particular stage (or \nstages) of the developing theological understanding and spiritual \nexperience of the early Messianic communities. Such is the kind of \nlively, dynamic faith behind our sacred texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians who claim that the Bible gives us an infallible, fixed \nrevelation of truth for all time must deny or completely ignore the \nhistorical processes of evolving faith that the Bible clearly mirrors.\u0014\n\u0014\nShouldnt we be at least as spiritually and theologically creative \nand imaginative as the first disciples? Shouldnt we be as open to \nand engaged in a changing, expanding, evolving faith as they were?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\\^ Patterson, Stephen J.

    "title": "ONLY LUKE REFERS TO BETHLEHEM AS \"CITY OF DAVID\"",
    "words": "Why Luke Referred to Bethlehem as 'City of David' \u0014\nLarry Eubanks\u0014\nThursday, December 24, 2015 \u0014\n\u0014\nLuke reminds his readers that David didn't come from a place of great \npower, but from a little town known as least of all the cities of \nJudah, Eubanks observes. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did Bethlehem become the \"city of David\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat title had always been given to Jerusalem. Forty times in the Old \nTestament, Jerusalem is referred to as the city of David, and no \nother city in the Bible is ever called by that name. Until Luke's \ngospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to \nthe city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the \nhouse and family of David. ... But the angel said to them, 'Do not be \nafraid; for see - I am bringing you good news of great joy for all \nthe people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, \nwho is the Messiah, the Lord'\" (Luke 2:4, 10-11).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is Luke up to in using this designation for a new city?\u0014\n\u0014\nJerusalem was a Jebusite city that David captured and made his \ncapital when he consolidated power after being proclaimed king over \nthe northern tribes (see 2 Samuel 5).\u0014\n\u0014\nSolomon further consolidated power at Jerusalem through his \nconstruction projects, particularly the Temple (see 2 Chronicles 3).\u0014\n\u0014\nWorship and sacrifice were no longer permissible in the \"high \nplaces,\" the tribal shrines in places like Shechem and Bethel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason given was because of the idolatry that easily made its way \ninto these places. The reign of Solomon, however, made it clear that \nidolatry could and did take root even in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe real reason for the centralization was concentration of power and \nwealth. Not only were sacrifices brought to the worship sites, \nproviding food for the Levites serving at them, but also the tribal \ntithes, which were essentially the Israelite form of taxation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMandating that the Temple was the only place to bring sacrifices \nenriched the power structures already in place in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while this might have worked out fine for Solomon and subsequent \nkings, it did not work out so well for the common person living in \nthe far reaches of the kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, there was the forced labor that required each man to \nleave his own fields or herds for one out of every three months to \nwork on the king's projects in Jerusalem (see 1 Kings 5).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was more than the tribes outside of Judah could take. After \nSolomon's death, they rebelled and anointed their own king.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoving forward to Jesus' day, Jerusalem still represented the \nconsolidation of power.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Temple, rebuilt after the Babylonian exile, had been essentially \ntorn down and greatly enlarged by Herod in the first century B.C.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was an effort to establish himself as the true king of the Jews, \neven though he was not of the line of David.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in Jerusalem where the high priest led the Sanhedrin, an \nassembly of Jewish leaders providing guidance to the nation of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the minds of the common person, Jerusalem was the seat of \nreligious and political power.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same way, Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect residing at \nCaesarea, knew that on important Jewish holy days he needed to be in \nJerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus challenged these powers residing in Jerusalem, and they each \nplayed a hand in crucifying him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, Luke is making a political statement by naming Bethlehem the city \nof David.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus challenged Herod's claim to be king, and asserted that Herod's \ntemple, with its wealth and corruption, was not the center of \nreligious life.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe cleansed the temple of its moneychangers that took advantage of \npeasant pilgrims and enriched the temple cult (see Matthew 21).\u0014\n\u0014\nHe confronted the high priest and the Sanhedrin who claimed to \nrepresent the interests of the people before a righteous God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy calling Bethlehem the city of David, Luke highlights Jesus' \nopposition to the powers that be in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe reminds his readers that David didn't come from a place of great \npower, but from a little town known as least of all the cities of \nJudah (see Micah 5:2; Matthew 2:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe true \"Anointed One\" would come from there also, and he would \nstand up for the little guys like the shepherds outside of Bethlehem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Messiah would stand up against the wealth, power and corruption \nof Jerusalem and would rule with justice and equity, not favoring the \n\"haves\" but blessing the \"have-nots.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the words of his mother Mary, through this child from Bethlehem \nthe Lord \"has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud \nin the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the powerful \nfrom their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry \nwith good things, and sent the rich away\" (Luke 1:46-53).\u0014\n\\\u0002Larry Eubanks is the pastor of First Baptist Church of Frederick, \nMaryland.\u0014",

    "title": "OBITUARY OIF JESUS -- BY A MODERN WRITER",
    "words": "Jesus of Nazareth, Whose Messianic Message Captivated Thousands, Dies \nat About 33 \u0014\n\u0014\nSam Roberts, an obituary writer for The New York Times, imagines how, \ngiven the facts available then, his predecessors might have reported \nthe aftermath of an execution in the Middle East one Friday two \nmillennia ago. \u0014\n\u0014\nby Sam Roberts\u0014\n\u0014\nJJesus of Nazareth, a Galilean carpenter turned itinerant minister \nwhose appeals to piety and whose repute as a healer had galvanized a \ngrowing contingent of believers, died on Friday after being crucified \nthat morning just outside Jerusalem, only days after his followers \nhad welcomed him triumphantly to the city as the anointed one and \nthe Son of David. He was about 33.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a man who had lived the first three decades of his life in \nvirtual obscurity, he attracted a remarkable following in only a few \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis reputation reflected a persuasive coupling of message, personal \nmagnetism, and avowed miracles. But it also resonated in the current \nmoment of spiritual and economic discontent and popular resentment of \nauthority and privilege, whether wielded by foreigners from Rome or \nby the Jewish priests in Jerusalem and their confederates.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Jesus had been preceded in recent years by a litany of false \nmessiahs. He followed a roster of self-styled prophets who promised \nsalvation and, with their ragtag followers from separatist sects, \ncults, and fractious rebel groups, were branded as bandits by the \ngoverning Romans, ostracized by the ruling priests as heretics in a \nperiod of pessimistic apocalyptic expectation, and already lost to \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the throngs that greeted him in Jerusalem and applauded his \ndaring assault on the Temple and his attack on the money changers who \noperate within its precincts with impunity, it is arguable whether \nthe legacy of this manwhom some contemporaries dismissed, if \nguardedly, as the one they call Messiahwill be any more enduring \nor his followers any more committed than the prophets and their \ndevotees who preceded him. \u0014\n\u0014\n(Moreover, what he might have accomplished further had he lived is \nalso debatable, since the average life span today is not much more \nthan 40.)\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus seems to have been universally respected as a wise man whose \nappeal for mercy, humility, and compassion reverberated powerfully. \nBut he left no written record, and, according to those who heard him, \nhe sometimes preached mixed messages. He would bless the peacemakers, \nbut also suggest that his followers buy swords. He would insist that \nhis mission was solely to minister to the lost sheep of the house of \nIsrael, but would also direct his devotees to proselytize to other \nnations.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven less is known about Jesuss youth. He was born Yeshua bar Joseph \n(his very name, Yahweh saves, or freedom, after Joshua, could be \nconsidered incitable), in all likelihood in Nazareth (he was known as \nthe Nazarean). Some adherents, however, insist that he was born in \nBethlehem, a claim that would polish his bona fides as an heir to \nKing David.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis father was named Joseph, although references to him are scarce \nafter Jesuss birth. His mother was Miriam, or Mary, and because he \nwas sometimes referred to as Marys son, questions had been raised \nabout his paternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe is believed to have been the eldest of at least six siblings, \nincluding four brothersJames, Joseph, Judas, and Simonand several \nsisters. He never marriedunusual for a man of his age, but not \nsurprising for a Jew with an apocalyptic vision.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis survivors include his mother, his brother James, and a number of \nother siblings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis family was devoutly Jewish, probably one of a hundred or so \nJewish families in a windswept, mostly mud-and-brick hilltop village \nin lower Galilee populated largely by peasants and laborers. Although \nit is only an hours walk from cosmopolitan Sepphoris, the Nazareth \nin which he was born still remains unidentified on most maps, an \nindication of its insignificance.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus spoke Aramaic, probably with a smattering of Hebrew and Greek, \nbut although Nazareth had a synagogue, there is no record of his \nhaving had access to a formal education.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe grew up in a turbulent time. King Herod the Great had managed to \npacify rival groups of Jews, Arabs, Greeks, Samaritans, and Syrians \non behalf of the territory occupied by Rome for nearly six decades. \nBut Herods death, roughly the same year that Jesus was born, and the \ncompletion of the Temple in Jerusalem contributed to mass \nunemployment, which further widened the gap in economic inequality \nthat Jesus would witness growing up.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his late 20s, Jesus was drawn to an ascetic preacher named John, \nwho initiated his followers into what he believed was the true nation \nof Israel. According to Johns custom, they repented their sins and \npurged their impurities in the Jordan River, an immersion ritual \ncommonly known in Hebrew as a mikveh and transliterated from Greek as \nbaptisma.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was baptized shortly before John the Baptists explosive \npopularity rattled the skittish Romans, who arrested and executed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before that, though, Jesus had begun his own ministry, referring \nto himself as rabbi or teacher, citing the scriptures, which \nsuggested he was literate, but also speaking in original parables.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was accompanied eventually by a dozen disciples, mirroring the 12 \ntribes of Israel. He was unusually receptive to women, and forgiving \nto sinners (those who flouted Gods commandments rather than priestly \nrituals) and even to reviled tax collectors (despite his \nanti-establishment rhetoric, he acknowledged the right of Rome to \ncollect taxes).\u0014\n\u0014\nHis following, of mostly Jewish and Greek heritage (he even converted \ncontemptuous Samaritans) grew as word of the miracles he had \nperformed spread before him. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese miracles mirrored those performed by earlier Jewish prophets in \nthe Hebrew Bible, although Jesus was said by his followers to have \noutdone his predecessors. Elijah, in one instance, was said to have \nemployed three prayers and some theatrics to raise a child from the \ndead; Jesus reputedly did it with just a word. Elisha, in another, \nwas said to have fed 100 people with 20 barley loaves; Jesus was \ncredited with feeding 5,000 with 5 loaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nSupported largely by the hospitality of benefactors in Capernaum, on \nthe Sea of Galilee, Jesus avoided large cities on his pilgrimage of \npreaching, which culminated last week in his arrival in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is believed that he timed his arrival to occur on the eve of \nPassover, when the citys population swells to celebrate a holiday \nrife with contemporary symbolism: the Jews salvation from foreign \nsubjugation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter running afoul of the Jewish elite in Jerusalem for blasphemy \nand his arrest on Thursday, Jesus was sentenced to death by Governor \nPontius Pilate. (The Jewish authorities lacked jurisdiction to impose \ncapital punishment.) The charge, in effect, was treason, for claiming \nto be King of the Jews or the anointed one (Messiah in Hebrew and \nAramaic; Christos in Greek).\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he was declared dead on Friday night, he was buried nearby in a \ncave. On Sunday, his disciples reported that the body was missing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditional reporting by Reza Aslan, Markus Bockmuehl, Raymond E. \nBrown, Gordon Campbell, Bart D.

    "title": "OBADIAH HOLMES WHIPPED FOR HIS BAPTIST BELIEFS",
    "words": "Thud. The whip's three cords slammed onto the bare back of Obadiah \nHolmes, who stood tied to the post. Thud... Thud... Thud. Thirty \ntimes the executioner struck with all his force. It was on this day, \nSeptember 5, 1651 in Boston, Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to witnesses, Obadiah did not groan or scream. Instead, he \npreached to the crowd. When the whipping was over, he said, \"You have \nstruck me as with roses.\" To observers, it was obvious that he was \nbadly wounded. As a matter of fact, he was so hurt that he had to \nstay in Boston for several weeks while he recovered, and could only \neat while kneeling on his elbows and knees.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could he take this punishment so bravely? Obadiah was filled with \njoy because he considered that the Lord Jesus Christ had counted him \nworthy to suffer for the sake of truth. The beating came about \nbecause he crossed into Massachusetts from neighboring Rhode Island \nmerely to help a sick old man and held a Baptist service in a private \nhome in Puritan New England. Arrested with him were the Rev. John \nClarke and another man. If Obadiah had been willing to pay a fine of \n30 pounds he could have escaped the whipping. (30 pounds was a large \nsum of money for a poor man in those days; Obadiah's whole estate at \nhis death was valued at only 130 pounds.) But he was so sure that he \nwas right that he even refused to help his persecutors to unbutton \nhis shirt, much less pay the unjust fine.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the majority of inhabitants in New England, Obadiah was an \nimmigrant from England. He did not become a Baptist until he settled \nin Massachusetts. Unable to bear the civil restrictions in Salem, he \nmoved to Rehobath. There his teaching split the local church and he \nbecame leader of a small Baptist group. The colony's leaders ordered \nhim \"to desist, and neither to ordain officers, nor to baptize, nor \nto break bread together, nor yet to meet upon the first day of the \nweek...\" And so Obadiah and his wife moved to Rhode Island, setting \nup house for the third time since coming to America.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1652, Obadiah succeeded Clarke as pastor of the Newport Baptist \nChurch. He was only the second pastor of that congregation, which was \nthe second Baptist Church in the New World. He led them for almost \nexactly thirty years--until his death in 1682.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the very end, Obadiah kept his eyes on the things of God. He had \nnine children and 42 grandchildren when he died. Seven years before \nthe end, he wrote urging them to remember the meanings of their Bible \nnames, given to them to help them stick fast to Christ. He urged them \nto square their lives with scripture and to meet, support, \nstrengthen, and reprove one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nObadiah's testimony lived on long after the punishment was past. \nHenry Dunster was one of the best-educated men in Massachusetts when \nhe was given the job of founding Cambridge College (now Harvard \nUniversity). When it appeared to him that the state could not answer \nthe claims of John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes and Mr. Crandall, he \nstudied his Bible and came to the conclusion that the persecuted men \nwere correct. Shortly afterwards, he publicly refused to have his own \nnewborn child baptized. Because of this he was dismissed from the \nleadership of Harvard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Boston itself, Obadiah's suffering impressed others who \nestablished a Baptist church there, regardless of the colony's \ndisapproval. Holmes' Last Will and Testimony is a highly regarded \npiece of Baptist exhortation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor Holmes, James T. The American Family of Rev.

    "title": "OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY REVEALS OUR BEST AND WORST SELVES",
    "words": "\u0014\nBy Jim Wallis 01-10-2017 \u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis 1 reveals the foundational value of every human being made in \nthe image of God (imago dei):\u0014\nThen God said, Let us make humankind in our image, according to our \nlikeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and \nover the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild \nanimals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon \nthe earth. So God created humankind in his image, in the image of \nGod he created them; male and female he created them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis text is also the theological undermining and biblical rebuke of \nwhite supremacy. In American history, one people decided to have \nviolent dominion over other peoples by saying they werent fully \nhuman and literally throwing away imago dei. White people  white \nChristians  knew they couldnt do to indigenous people and kidnapped \nAfricans what they were doing in taking free land, labor, and lives \naway from other human beings who were created in the image of God  \nso we said they were all less than human. We even wrote it into our \nConstitution.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2008, our nation seemed ready for that new America that Barack \nObama represented. White backlash began almost immediately. \u0014\n\u0014\nFast forward 220 years to the election of Barack Obama to the \npresidency of the United States: a fundamental blow to white \nsupremacy  a black man in the highest office of the land and most \npowerful position in the world. That was and will always be a great \nlegacy of that election  a historic moment in the longstanding and \nongoing movement to undo white supremacy and privilege that \nchallenged and threatened all the ways the original sin still lingers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember election night in 2008 when we hosted an election watch \nparty with mostly twentysomethings filling our house. Early on, Obama \nwas expected to win, and most of the young people in my house were \ncelebrating, even out dancing in the streets of our multi-racial \nneighborhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I was still with most of the old black guys that lived in our \nneighborhood  not sure I really believed that a black president \nwould be elected in our lifetimes. If all the undecideds went \nagainst him in the end, Obama would lose. I was the only one left in \nthe house watching the returns, as the votes he needed for his \nelectoral victory were officially tabulated and the election called. \nWhen that happened, I quietly and privately broke down in tears, but \nsoon went out to the streets to join the next generation who were \nready to help build the bridge to a new America, along with the \nmajority of minorities that will exist by 2040. We all went to \nObamas inauguration with 2 million other people on one of the \ncoldest January days in history. Our nation seemed ready for that new \nAmerica that Barack Obama represented.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe white backlash began almost immediately. Republican leaders \nannounced their primary goal to make his presidency fail, before he \neven began, even though he was trying to reach out to them. The \nnever-ending accusations and falsehoods began with a conspiratorial \nracist campaign to prove that the new black president didnt have a \nbirth certificate and wasnt really one of us, i.e. a real \nAmerican. (Of course, that same lie would help Donald Trump launch \npolitical career in 2011.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was indignity after indignity: a congressman yelling You lie! \nduring the presidents State of the Union speech; continuing false \nclaims that one of the most explicitly Christian presidents (the \nfirst to do things like hosting an annual Easter breakfast in the \nWhite House) was actually a secret Muslim.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the most hypocritical attacks have come from people on the \nreligious right who claim they are for family values, then \ncompletely ignore some of the clearest and best family role models \nthe White House has ever seen. Obama as a husband and father, \ntogether with Michelle, has shown our nations children some of the \nbest demonstrations of healthy and strong family life of any U.S. \npresident.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake a moment and listen in your mind to all the ugly rhetoric and \nhateful language directed toward Barack Obama during his presidency \nand even in the 2016 presidential campaign. Close your eyes and \nlisten to all the painful words you remember. I know its hard. But \nthen remember and declare the opening three words of the Genesis 1:26 \npassage above. Then God said \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat God said is so much more important than the words of white \nbacklash to what God has said. It is indeed Gods voice that is the \nmost powerful response to all the language of hate and fear that \nrepresents the death knell of white supremacy in this country, \ndespite being one of the ugliest things to witness during the \npresidency of Barack Obama.\u0014\n\u0014\nGods voice is the most powerful response to all the hate \nrepresenting the death knell of white supremacy in this country. \u0014\n\u0014\nI became a friend of Illinois State Sen. Obamas shortly after his \nadult conversion to Christianity and was on President Obamas first \nfaith-based council. We have often spoken of his personal faith and \ntalked together about how it should best shape public leadership and \npolicy. His legacy has and will always be central to that vision of a \nbeloved community, as Dr. King called it, where our public and \ncivil life is rooted in the spiritual foundation of the truth  that \nall of us are created in the image of God. That is the word, Gods \nWord, that will ultimately defeat the recurring original sin of \nAmerican society where privilege and punishment are based on skin \ncolor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarack Obamas legacy is the public refutation of that sin and the \ncall to repentance  turning around and going in a whole new \ndirection, making our way to a new and demographically transformed \nAmerica. And that is also the reason why there has been such a deep \nracial backlash to that new America  and has now even served as the \nunderlying motivation for a presidential candidate of a major \npolitical party.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis isnt about toeing some party line and always agreeing with \nObamas policies and priorities. Many religious leaders have pushed \nPresident Obama to more forcefully push issues of poverty, economic \njustice, and immigration and have objected to his use of drones; I \nhave been one of those offering challenges. After the public \nattention focused on so many police shootings of young \nAfrican-American men and women, Obama more strongly stood up for \nracial justice in our policing and criminal justice systems. He \nbrought health care to millions of new people who were without it. \nAnd in what may be one of his most lasting legacies, President Obama \nhas already had significant achievements and set into place a strong \ndirection for dealing with the urgent issue of climate change. That \nis a legacy that will benefit all of our children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut ultimately it will be more than the impressive list of \naccomplishments that will determine the legacy of President Barack \nObama. It will be what he has represented for the future as the first \nblack man to win the White House and how God has used this man to \nhelp America further the long process of repenting of our original \nsin and building that new America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis column is adapted from Jim Wallis foreword to the forthcoming \nbook Mr. President: Interfaith Perspectives on the Historic \nPresidency of Barack H. Obama, compiled by Barbara Williams-Skinner \nand Darryl Sims (2017).\u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014\nJim Wallis \u0014\nJim Wallis is president of Sojourners.\u0014",

    "title": "ONA JUDGE STAINS - WASHINGTON'S FAMOUS SLAVE",
    "words": "Ona Judge Stains\u0014\nBy Edward Lawler, Jr.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore is known about Oney Judge than any other Mount Vernon slave \nbecause she lived to an old age, and she was interviewed by \nabolitionist newspapers in the nineteenth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nOney (born c. 1773) was a dower slave, the daughter of Betty, a \nseamstress, and Andrew Judge, a white English tailor who was an \nindentured servant at Mount Vernon in the early 1770s. Austin, about \nfifteen years Oney's senior, would have been her half-brother. \nWashington does not seem to have recognized Oney as being Judge's \nchild, which may indicate that Judge himself did not admit paternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt about age ten, Oney was brought in to the manor house, possibly as \na playmate for Mrs. Washington's granddaughter Nelly Custis. Oney \nbecame an expert at needlework, and eventually became Mrs. \nWashington's body servant. In April 1789, Oney was one of seven \nenslaved Africans brought to New York City by the Washingtons to work \nin the presidential residence. With the change in the capital in \nNovember 1790, she was brought to Philadelphia, and probably shared a \nroom with Nelly in the President's House.\u0014\n\u0014\nOney is recorded as accompanying Mrs. Washington on shopping trips \nand social visits. There are entries in the household ledgerbooks for \nclothes for the teen-aged girl and trips to the circus. Philadelphia \nwas a center of abolitionism, and had a large free black population. \nOney made friends among the free blacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington recognized that slavery was unpopular in Philadelphia, and \nbegan to replace the slaves in the presidential household with white \nGerman indentured servants. Austin died in December, 1794, on a trip \nback to Mount Vernon. This left Oney, Moll and Hercules.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Washington's eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth Custis, married \nEnglish expatriate Thomas Law on March 20, 1796. Washington invited \nthe couple to visit Philadelphia and stay at the President's House. \nMrs. Washington informed Oney that she was to be given as a gift to \nthe bride.\u0014\n\u0014\nOney planned her escape with the aid of her free black friends. She \nslipped away one night in late May 1796 while the Washingtons were \nhaving dinner, and was hidden by her friends until she could find \npassage on a northbound ship. Oney either went directly to \nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, or arrived there by way of New York City.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in Philadelphia, Mrs. Washington felt betrayed, and claimed that \nOney must have been abducted and seduced by a Frenchman. She wrote \nthat Oney had always been well-treated, and even had a room of her \nown (Nelly was attending finishing school in Annapolis). The First \nLady urged the President to advertise a reward for Oney's recapture, \nbut Washington refused, realizing how unpopular that would be.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater that summer, Elizabeth Langdon, daughter of Senator John \nLangdon of New Hampshire, spotted Oney walking on a street in \nPortsmouth. Elizabeth was one of Nelly's closest friends, a frequent \nvisitor to the President's House, and (reportedly) a classmate at the \nsame Annapolis finishing school. Oney avoided Nelly's friend, but \neither Elizabeth or her father wrote to Washington telling him where \nOney could be found.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington asked Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott to handle \nthe matter, and the latter wrote to Joseph Whipple, the Collector of \nCustoms of Portsmouth, requesting his help in the return of the \nPresident's wife's property. Whipple made an attempt at complying \nwith what must have seemed like an intimidating order, but warned in \na letter that abducting the girl and placing her on a ship headed \nsouth might cause a riot on the docks. Whipple interrogated Oney, and \nreported to Wolcott that, \"After a cautious examination it appeared \nto me that she had not been decoyed away [by a Frenchman] as had been \napprehended, but that a thirst for compleat freedom which she was \ninformed would take place on her arrival here & Boston had been her \nonly motive for absconding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nScared, lonely and miserable, Oney tried to negotiate through \nWhipple. She offered to return to the Washingtons, but only if she \nwould be guaranteed freedom upon their deaths. An indignant President \nresponded in person to Whipple's letter: \"To enter into such a \ncompromise with her, as she suggested to you, is totally inadmissable \n[sic], \u2026 it would neither be politic or just to reward \nunfaithfulness with a premature preference [of freedom]; and thereby \ndiscontent before hand the minds of all her fellow-servants who by \ntheir steady attachments are far more deserving than herself of \nfavor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years later, Washington's nephew, Burnwell Bassett, Jr., traveled \nto New Hampshire on business. He was entertained by the Langdons, \nand, over dinner, mentioned that one of the things he hoped to \naccomplish during the trip was the recapture of Oney. This time the \nLangdons helped Oney, who was now married to a sailor named Jack \nStaines, and the mother of a child. Word was sent to her for her \nfamily to immediately go into hiding. Bassett returned to Virginia \nwithout Oney.\u0014\n\u0014\nOney had three children with Staines, all of whom predeceased her, as \ndid her husband. Because of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 which \nWashington signed into law in Philadelphia (probably in his private \noffice barely a dozen feet from where Oney slept), she lived the rest \nof her life as a fugitive. Ona Judge Staines died in Greenland, New \nHampshire on February 25, 1848.\u0014",

    "title": "O CHRISTMAS TREE",
    "words": "For most Americans, a tinsel-decked tree is a holiday essential. But \nwhy do we put decorated firs in our homes?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did the custom start? \u0014\n\u0014\nAs with many Christmas traditions, its roots go back to pagan times. \nSome Northern \u0014\nEuropean pagans believed that the sun was a god and that he went \nthrough a yearly period \u0014\nof ill health in winter. They put up evergreen boughs on the winter \nsolstice, around Dec. 21, \u0014\nthe shortest day of the year-the evergreens reminding them of all the \ngreenery that would \u0014\ngrow again when the sun god regained his strength and spring \narrived. Ancient Egyptians \u0014\nfollowed a similar tradition, adorning their homes with green palm \nfronds to mark the- \u0014\nreturn of Ra, a hawk-headed god who wore the sun as a blazing crown. \nAnd ancient \u0014\nRomans used fir trees to decorate their temples during Saturnalia, a \nwinter festival in honor \u0014\nof Saturn, the god ofagriculture. Early Christian theologian \nTertullian wasn't a fan; in \u0014\nthe 2nd century, he told his fellow believers to leave the plants and \ntrees to the heathens, \u0014\n\"over whom the fires of hell are imminent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did Christians get on board? \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's a matter of ongoing dispute. The Eastern European cities of \nTallinn and Riga both claim to have hosted the first Christmas tree: \nTallinn in 1441, Riga in 1510. Each city says the Brotherhood of \nBlackheads-s-an association of local unmarried merchants, shipowners, \nand foreigners in Livonia (now modern-day Estonia and \nLatvia)--erected a tree in their town square over Christmas, danced \naround it, and then set it alight. Around the same time,' medieval \nGermans were incorporating evergreens into their own Christmastime \nrituals, via the \"Paradise Tree\": an apple-adorned fir that \nrepresented the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. But \nChristmas trees didn't make it into the home until Martin Luther, the \nfounder of the Protestant Reformation, supposedly experienced a very \nspecial yuletide \"vision\" in 1536.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did Luther see? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe German theologian was taking a nighttime stroll through a pine \nforest near his home in Wittenberg when he glanced up and was \nawestruck by the thousands of stars twinkling through the branches. \nThe wondrous sight reminded him of Jesus departing heaven for Earth \nat Christmas, and Luther raced home to re-create the holy scene for \nhis family-dragging a tree into their parlor and decorating its \nbranches with lighted candles. Other Germans started covering their \nown Christmas firs with gingerbread, gilded apples, and other \ntrinkets. Some preferred to deck a single yew branch \u0014\nwith colored paper and ribbons, a ritual witnessed by English poet \nSamuel Taylor Coleridge in 1798. \"Under this bough,\" wrote \nColeridge,' children and il\" parents exchange presents \"with kisses \u0014\nili and embraces.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did the trees arrive in the U.S.? \u0014\n \u0014\nThey were brought to Pennsylvania by German settlers and may have \neven played a part in \u0014\nthe Revolutionary War. Legend has it that as George Washington was \ncrossing the Delaware \u0014\nRiver on Dec. 25,1776, Hessian mercenaries fighting for the British \nwere busy decorating \u0014\ntrees and getting drunk. Suffice to say, they were in no state to \nfight the ensuing battle, \u0014\nand lost. But Christmas trees didn't become de rigueur among \nfashionable society until they \u0014\nwere granted the royal seal of approval. In 1848, the Illustrated \nLondon News published \u0014\na sketch of Queen Victoria's Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, a gift \nfrom her German con- \u0014\nsort, Prince Albert. The image was reprinted in Philadelphia's \nGodey's Lady's Book, with \u0014\nthe queen's crown and Albert's moustache removed to make it look \nmore\" American.\" \u0014\nEast Coast ladies went wild for the heartwarming scene-and Christmas \ntrees became a \u0014\nstaple of the American home.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE WEEK, Dec. 22, 2017\u0014",

    "words": "Our boys are in trouble \u0014\n                               \tRobin Beres  \tApr 28, \n2018           Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nIts been a long road but today, throughout the developed world, \nwomen seem to be doing as well as, maybe even better than, men. Women \nhave become empowered and confident in who they are and what they can \ncontribute to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, there are more females than males in medical school, in \nbusiness school, and in law school. Women are able to serve in every \nmilitary job that they are physically able to qualify for. No one \nblinks an eye at female astronauts, plumbers, or race-car drivers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are starting new companies 1.5 times more often than men. The \nwomens movement that has risen in response to Donald Trumps 2016 \nvictory has launched an unprecedented number of females into \npolitics. The number of women running for Congress in 2018 is up \nnearly 350 percent from 2016. Why, within a decade or two, women may \nbe running almost everything.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, its a good time to be an American girl. She is thriving.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, one cannot say the same about our boys  not in the \nU.S. or in any other First World country. In all 63 of the most \ndeveloped nations, boys are lagging behind girls in every academic \nsubject. Theyre also suffering more from mental and physical health \nissues and have fallen behind their female counterparts in IQ tests \nand socialization skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the classroom, boys face greater challenges than girls. By nature, \nboys fidget more, are more vocal, and tend to be messier than girls. \nThey are far more likely to get in trouble at school, to be \nsuspended, and to drop out. They are three times more likely than \ngirls to be diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd their troubles magnify as they grow older. Boys are far more \nlikely to abuse drugs and alcohol  and they do so at earlier ages. \nNearly 75 percent of all violent crime committed by teenagers is done \nso by young men. And in 2016, males accounted for nearly 78 percent \nof teen suicides in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more tragically, when boys are hurting, they are far more likely \nto hurt others as well. Almost every mass shooting  in restaurants, \nschools, churches  has been at the hands of young men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recently released book, The Boy Crisis, Warren Farrell (who \nalso wrote Why Men Are the Way They are and The Myth of Male \nPower) and co-author John Gray (Men are from Mars, Women are from \nVenus), discuss the reasons behind this decline and the potentially \ncatastrophic results if it continues.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnyone who has raised young men will be able to relate to the \nconcerns discussed in the The Boy Crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nFarrell, a world-recognized leader on mens and womens issues, \npoints out that when only one sex wins, both sexes lose. Being rich \nand successful does a woman little good if she also wants a family \nbut cant find a decent partner to father her children and help raise \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest part of the problem, according to Farrell (and countless \nothers have also pointed this out) is the tragic dilemma of boys \ngrowing up without fathers. Whether that happens because of divorce  \nmothers usually become the primary caregivers when a marriage ends  \nor because 53 percent of women under 30 now give birth out of \nwedlock, 25 percent of American kids are growing up in fatherless \nhomes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile thats hard for children of both sexes, it can lead to real \nproblems for boys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoys need a father figure to emulate. The young human brain learns \nmainly by imitating. A boy who doesnt have a dad around to take cues \nfrom and model his behavior after is going to be hard-pressed trying \nto figure out how he is supposed to act. Heaven help us if that child \nis learning what constitutes male behavior by playing violent video \ngames or watching TV and movies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile women have become adept in so many formerly male-dominated jobs \nand roles, the one thing we cannot do is teach our boys how to be \nmen. Sure, we can teach them right from wrong and other necessary \nlife lessons, but we cant teach them what it means to be masculine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey need their dads to guide them, to teach them how to channel \naggression and energy into positive behaviors. They need men in their \nlives with whom theyre comfortable discussing physical and emotional \nchanges as they grow.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the solutions suggested in Farrells book are common-sense \nideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nTeach men and women to talk to one another  have real two-way \ndialogues rather than one-way monologues.\u0014\n\u0014\nGet dads involved in childrens lives. A father who is there for his \nkids has a far greater impact on them than the dad who spends \ncountless hours earning a big paycheck.\u0014\n\u0014\nGive dads the option of being the stay-at-home parent. Turns out they \ncan be just as nurturing as moms.\u0014\n\u0014\nFarrell suggests that perhaps the best way to combat this national \nproblem is to decrease divorce rates. Thats a start  and decreasing \nout-of-wedlock births is also vitally important.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a coincidence, but still notable that the same month The Boy \nCrisis was released, researchers at Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun \nSchool of Public Health and Community Medicine in Jerusalem announced \nthat sperm counts in men living in developed nations have plummeted \n59 percent in recent years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough they didnt examine the cause, they noted the phenomenon has \nbeen linked to substance abuse, obesity, smoking, stress, and other \npoor lifestyle choices  the same issues that often arise when young \nmen have no male role models in their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nSure, theres probably no correlation between these two \nmale-centered, First World-only problems. But in some way, it seems \nto underscore the urgency that is needed to address the growing \nproblems confronting our sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nmberes@timesdispatch.com (804) 649-6305\u0014",

    "title": "ONE TOO OLD, THE OTHER TOO YOUNG TO BE A MOTHER",
    "words": "The  lesson from Lukes Gospel takes place some months before the \nbirth of Christ. In fact, Mary has only recently learned from the \nangel that she will bear a child, a child conceived of the Holy \nSpirit.  Almost immediately, Mary decides to visit her older cousin \nElizabeth. This meant she had to travel about 100 miles south to the \nhill country of Judah.  This would be about a five day journey, an \namazing trip for a young teenage pregnant girl. Its disconcerting to \nrealize that Mary would have been in about the 9th, maybe the 10th \ngrade when all this happened to her.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the awkwardness of her situation played a role in her \ndecision to visit her cousin.  After all, for having a child out of \nwedlock, she could be stoned for adultery. At the very least, she \ncould be rejected by Joseph, her parents, her village. She could \nspend the rest of her days in poverty, struggling to keep herself and \nher child fed outside the safety of a marriage and community. We \naccept an out-of-wedlock pregnancy much more casually in our society, \nbut this would have been a big deal in biblical times.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth herself was married to a priest named Zechariah. Elizabeth \nwas a descendant of the Hebrew peoples first high priest, Aaron. \nThey were a deeply religious couple. Luke describes them as being \nrighteous. Elizabeth was also pregnant for the first time. She would \nalso face ridicule. The source of Elizabeths social torment, \nhowever, would be age. There would be those who would whisper to \ntheir friends, Isnt she too old to have a baby? Elizabeth was far \nbeyond normal childbearing years, yet she was six months pregnant. In \nfact Gabriel came to her long before he came to Mary to announce her \nsons coming. Elizabeths son was not divinely conceived any more \nthan you and I were, but his birth was still significant. He would be \nthe forerunner of the Messiah. We know him as John the Baptist.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth and Mary were quite a pair. As Dr. M. Craig Barnes has \nnoted, One of them is too old to be a mother and the other is too \nyoung. But both are in the hands of God.\u0014",

The findings, released in the American Worldview \nInventory 2020, show a disconcerting realm for those who may consider \nthemselves evangelists. The survey also found Millennials held the \nlowest number of biblical worldview holders, at just two percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the study, Americans' biblical worldview has been \nrapidly eroding but eroding the fastest for millennials. \"Previous \nfindings from the American Worldview Inventory 2020 show the rapid \nerosion of the biblical worldview in American culturewith only 6 \npercent of adults today possessing a biblical worldview, down from \ntwice that (12 percent) in the mid-1990s.

Those views are that Jesus \nChrist lived a sinless life; God is the all-powerful and all-knowing \nCreator of the universe and He still rules it today; salvation is a \ngift from God and cannot be earned; Satan is real; a Christian has a \nresponsibility to share their faith in Christ with other people; and \nthe Bible is accurate in all of its teachings.\"\u0014",

    "title": "OH, FREEDOM!",
    "words": "Oh, freedom\u0014\nThe Bible in black Christian movements for liberation\u0014\n\u0014\nA group of enslaved Black Christians gathered by the woods on a \nSunday afternoon to hear a White preacher. Charles Colcock Jones \n(18041863) was three months into his grand project to bring the \ngospel to the enslaved. His listeners were generally receptive to the \nPrinceton Theological Seminary graduate, who considered himself a \ngodly slave owner. Joness morning sermon cautioned against idols, \nurging Blacks to abandon charms, sorcery, and superstition. This \nwas well received. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the afternoon, however, Jones preached about the runaway slave \nOnesimus. Despite the severe punishment his hearers risked for simply \nquestioning a slave-owner, they protested his words which required \nrunaway slaves to return to their masters as Christian obedience: \nThe doctrine is one-sided, one told him after worship. That is not \nthe Gospel at all, said another. It is all [telling us not to] \nRunaway, Runaway, Runaway. Some left during the service. Others told \nhim they would never come to hear him preach again.\u0014\n\u0014\nA fiery furnace\u0014\nThe reaction of this congregation in Liberty County, Georgia, reveals \na critical feature of Black biblical interpretation: it was forged in \nthe fiery furnace of slavery. From the Great Awakening in the 1740s \nthrough the nineteenth century, the overwhelming majority of Black \nChristians first came to faith through Methodist, Baptist, or \nPresbyterian evangelicalism. But the overwhelming majority of them \nalso came to faith as enslaved people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat meant that Black Christians simultaneously shared and departed \nfrom ways that White evangelicals understood the Bible and faith. \nLike White evangelicals they believed in the authority of the Bible, \nthe significance of Christs atoning sacrifice, the necessity of \nconversion, and the importance of evangelism. (Jones had often \npreached on these subjects.) But Black Christians also prioritized a \ntruth from the Bible that White evangelicals did not often emphasize \nor fully explore: God frees us from more than our sins. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe enslaved Black Christians who challenged Joness preaching that \nafternoon demonstrated the depth of that conviction. Every enslaved \nperson knew from childhood what enslavers expected of them in terms \nof obedience. But in their eyes, something at the core of the faith \nwas at stake. By declaring that this is not the Gospel at all, the \ndissenters did not claim that Jones simply held a different \nexpression of the faith, as if he were a member of a different \ndenomination. Instead they asserted that the preacher read the Bible \nwrongly.\u0014\n\u0014\nBound for the Promised Land\u0014\nExodus loomed large as the fundamental narrative of the Old Testament \nfor enslaved Christians. It convinced them that leaving slavery was \nnot running away from proper authority; it was escaping injustice. \nThe numerous spirituals composed and revised by enslaved Christians \nreveal this understanding of the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, many spirituals speak of the redemptive power of Christ \nand identify with Jesuss suffering. But a large portion of them sing \nof Moses, Pharaoh, the Promised Land, and the River Jordan. Harriet \nTubman, who composed her own spirituals, sang Im bound for the \nPromised Land, on the other side of Jordan within hearing of her \npuzzled enslaver the night before she fled slavery. She regularly \nsang of Egypt and Canaan while leading fugitives away. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Christians were drawn to a God who explained his character to \nthe children of Israel by saying repeatedly, I am the LORD your God, \nwho brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of \nslavery (Exodus 20:2). Black Christians saw this deliverance as a \ncritically important feature of Gods character and his plan for \nhumanity. Those biblical themes continue to animate Black \nChristianity today. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis Black biblicism emerged in dialogue with, and in reaction to, a \nsociety dominated by Whites. Not only were 90 percent of African \nAmericans in the early nineteenth century enslaved, they were vastly \noutnumbered by White Americans. In this social reality, White \nAmerican Christians could easily deflect difficult questions that \nslavery raised for their faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nA large proportion of northern White Christians considered slavery \nwrong but did not yet conclude from the Bible they ought to support \nabolition, which they viewed as a radical movement. Many nonenslaving \nWhites, North and South, justified slavery with simplistic readings \nof selective biblical texts. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile Christian enslavers shaped the biblical message, \nconsciously or unconsciously, to their interests because they \ncontrolled discussions with enslaved Christians. Until the issue came \nto a head in the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations \nin the 1840s, most Whites were not compelled to listen seriously to \nantislavery arguments from the Bible. After each of those \ndenominations split over slavery, White southerners heard even fewer \nopposing interpretations.\u0014\n\u0014\nPure, peaceable, and impartial\u0014\nBut while Whites could ignore Black interpretations, enslaved people \nlived with the White Christian justification of slavery every day. \nAnd free Blacks were not free to ignore slavery. After all slavery \nwas still legal in 1794 Pennsylvania when Richard Allens resistance \nto discrimination in Methodism led him to create a Black congregation \nthat would later become the African Methodist Episcopal Churchthe \nfirst independent Black denomination in the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe liberating character of God that Blacks found in the Bible deeply \ninformed abolitionist efforts. Frederick Douglass (18181895) stands \nas the most famous example of this. While still enslaved a teenage \nDouglass had a conversion experience at a Methodist revival near his \nplantation. In his first years of freedom in New Bedford, \nMassachusettsbefore he wrote Narrative (1845) and launched out as an \nabolitionist speakerhe preached at the local African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout his life he quoted the Bible regularly and drew on \nbiblical themes in his speeches and writings (see p. 11). His \nrhetoric did not pull any punches: \u0014\n\u0014\nBetween the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of \nChrist, I recognize the widest possible difference. . . . I love the \npure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore \nhate the corrupt, slave-holding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, \npartial and hypocritical Christianity of this land.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Christians with little understanding of the experience of \nthe enslaved often became quite defensive listening to this rhetoric. \nThat was part of Douglasss point. He believed one had to be made \nuncomfortable to see things more clearly. How could one call the \nUnited States a Christian nation, Douglass argued, if it sanctioned \nthe sale of children away from their parents? \u0014\n\u0014\nEven Charles Colcock Jones, despite his pledge to never break up a \nnuclear family, had sold a Black family to enslavers in New Orleans. \nWhile keeping the letter of his promise, he had separated parents \nfrom adult children, grandparents from grandchildren, uncles and \naunts from nieces and nephews, and cousins from cousins, all left \nwith no means of seeing each other again. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who \nhad known Jones at Princeton, saw slaverys corrupting effects on \nthis Christian man. She used his writings to depict slavery in Uncle \nToms Cabin (1852). \u0014\n\u0014\nBlack abolitionist David Walker (17961830) wrote just as forcefully \nas Douglass. See how they treat us in open violation of the Bible?, \nhe argued in an 1829 pamphlet that surreptitiously circulated in \nenslaved communities. An American minister, with the Bible in his \nhand, holds us and our children in the most abject slavery and \nwretchedness, Walker declared. Now I ask them, would they like for \nus to hold them and their children in abject slavery and \nwretchedness? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhites who turned to the book of Philemon to justify slavery failed \nto consider that Onesimus was not Black. Why, then, did Whites insist \nthat only Blacks could be enslaved? Proslavery Christians remained \nblind to the reality that they were imposing their own racial \ncategories on biblical texts, he argued.\u0014\n\u0014\nConversion and liberation \u0014\nAn African American Great Awakening swept through the South at the \nend of the nineteenth century. The number of Black Baptists in the \nUnited States increased from about 400,000 in 1860 to 2.2 million in \n1906; Black Methodists from 190,000 in 1860 to more than one million \nin 1906. The estimated percentage of active Christians among African \nAmericans rose from around 17 percent in 1860 to 42 percent in 1900.\u0014\n\u0014\nDriven by Black evangelism and grounded in Black churches independent \nof White supervision, this produced a remarkable number of individual \nconversions to Christianity. But ideals of liberation also fueled \nthis massive movement. Slavery, among other things, had denied \nreligious freedom to Black southerners. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome states had legally prohibited the ordination of Black ministers; \nmost states had legally prohibited the enslaved from holding \nreligious meetings without White supervision; and many enslavers \nwould not allow the enslaved to hold religious services. A number of \nsouthern states had passed laws making it illegal to teach the \nenslaved to read and write, undermining a key Protestant conviction: \nthe freedom to read the Bible for oneself. A few Whites defied these \nlaws, some states permitted Black literacy, and some enslaved Blacks \ntaught one another to read, but the vast majority had remained \nilliterate. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbolition, however, opened tremendous opportunities for Black \nsoutherners to read the Bible for the first time. One elderly man in \nMobile, Alabama, at the end of the war joined his grandson at a Black \nprimary school newly created by missionaries. He told the teacher he \nwouldnt trouble her very much, but he must learn to read the Bible \nand the Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\nFueled by such passions, the Black church not only grew dramatically \nduring the late nineteenth century but emerged as the foundation of \nBlack community life. Independent Black ministers preached freely not \nonly on personal transformation, but also on biblical themes of hope \nand liberation for the disinherited. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Black community needed this sort of institution. Many Whites gave \nup on the peculiar institution, but not the underlying conviction \nthat Whites ought to control society. Despite freedoms gained during \nReconstruction in the 1860s and 1870s, African Americans faced tragic \nsetbacks in the 1880s and 1890s. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhite southerners stripped them of voting rights, solidified \nsegregation, and began the vicious practice of lynching in the 1890s. \nAfter the turn of the century, southern Blacks who migrated to \nnorthern cities for a marginally greater set of opportunities often \nfaced embedded prejudices and de facto segregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nPlenty of nice people\u0014\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, liberationist biblicism \ncontinued to inform the Black church. Black Christians could not \naccept the assumption, held by many White Christians, that simply \ntreating one another kindly would effectively address racial \nproblems; plenty of nice people supported segregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome southern church leaders began to see segregation as a problem by \nthe early 1950s, but many actively supported it. Meanwhile many \nnorthern Whites passively ignored the issue and continued to deflect \nbiblical arguments made by Black Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther King Jr.s branch of the civil rights movement \nchallenged this. Though he had adopted some new theological ideas in \nseminary, King (19291968) still drank deeply from the biblical \nfountains of his childhood Baptist church. The Old Testament \nparticularly shaped his promotion of prophetic Christianity: though \nthe just suffered and the unjust prospered, the arc of Gods activity \nthrough history would trend toward justice and hope. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the grassroots level, Christians from Black churches formed the \nbackbone of the civil rights movement, infusing it with traditional \npatterns of faith. Recruitment often resembled evangelistic \ncampaigns. During the seminal 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, Ralph \nAbernathy and his assistants rounded up sinners in the bars and \npool halls of the city to join churched Blacks in the boycott. At \ndifferent times participants held prayer vigils, reported miraculous \nhealings, and spoke in tongues. John Lewis (19402020) reported that \nsome meetings resembled revivals. \u0014\n\u0014\nKings Letter from a Birmingham Jail most clearly illustrates the \nbiblical justification Black Christians made for ending segregation. \nEight White clergy of Birmingham had published a letter to King \narguing that Kings protests disrupted the peace, moved too quickly, \nand disobeyed the law. In response King justified his actions not \nonly from great philosophers and theologians, but from the Bible, \ngrounding his argument that unjust laws are no laws at all in the \nprophets, the life of Christ, and the story of the apostle Paul. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe White clergy of Birmingham thought they understood racism well \nenough. But Kings letter pushed themand anyone who read it \ncloselyto consider more deeply the Black biblical tradition. That \ntradition points to a God whose character not only promotes \nindividual transformation, but liberation and justice. King \nchallenged his White clergy brothers: \u0014\n\u0014\nI have looked at the Souths beautiful churches with their lofty \nspires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of \nher massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found \nmyself asking: What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Jay R. Case\u0014\n[Christian History originally published this article in Christian \nHistory Issue #138 in 2021]\u0014\n\u0014\nJay R.

    "title": "ORAL TRADITION MYTHOLOGY ABOUT THE ALAMO STORY",
    "words": "We've Been Telling the Alamo Story Wrong for Nearly 200 Years. Now \nIt's Time to Correct the Record\u0014\n\u0014\nBY BRYAN BURROUGH AND JASON STANFORD JUNE 9, 2021 5:43 PM EDT\u0014\n\u0014\nImagine if the U.S. were to open interior Alaska for colonization \nand, for whatever reason, thousands of Canadian settlers poured in, \nestablishing their own towns, hockey rinks and Tim Hortons stores. \nWhen the U.S. insists they follow American laws and pay American \ntaxes, they refuse. When the government tries to collect taxes, they \nshoot and kill American soldiers. When law enforcement goes after the \nkillers, the colonists, backed by Canadian financing and mercenaries, \ntake up arms in open revolt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an American, how would you feel? Now you can imagine how Mexican \nPresident Jose Lopez de Santa Anna would have felt in 1835, because \nthats pretty much the story of the revolution that paved the way for \nTexas to become its own nation and then an American state.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf thats not the version of history youre familiar with, youre not \nalone. The version most Americans know, the Heroic Anglo Narrative \nthat has held sway for nearly 200 years, holds that American \ncolonists revolted against Mexico because they were oppressed and \nfought for their freedom, a narrative that has been soundly \nrebutted by 30-plus years of academic scholarship. But the many myths \nsurrounding Texas birth, especially those cloaking the fabled 1836 \nsiege at the Alamo mission in San Antonio, remain cherished in the \nstate. Even as the nation is undergoing a sweeping reassessment of \nits racial history, and despite decades of academic research that \ncasts the Texas Revolt and the Alamos siege in a new light, little \nof this has permeated the conversation in Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nStart with the Alamo. So much of what we know about the battle is \nprovably wrong. William Travis never drew any line in the sand; this \nwas a tale concocted by an amateur historian in the late 1800s. There \nis no evidence Davy Crockett went down fighting, as John Wayne \nfamously did in his 1960 movie The Alamo, a font of misinformation; \nthere is ample testimony from Mexican soldiers that Crockett \nsurrendered and was executed. The battle, in fact, should never have \nbeen fought. Travis ignored multiple warnings of Santa Annas \napproach and was simply trapped in the Alamo when the Mexican army \narrived. He wrote some dramatic letters during the ensuing siege, \nits true, but how anyone could attest to the defenders bravery is \nbeyond us. The men at the Alamo fought and died because they had no \nchoice. Even the notion they fought to the last man turns out to be \nuntrue. Mexican accounts make clear that, as the battle was being \nlost, as many as half the Texian defenders fled the mission and \nwere run down and killed by Mexican lancers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor is it at all clear that the Alamos defenders bought time for \nSam Houston to raise the army that eventually defeated Santa Anna at \nthe Battle of San Jacinto the following month. Santa Anna had told \nMexico City he expected to take San Antonio by March 2; he ended up \ndoing so on March 6. In the end, the siege at the Alamo ended up \ncosting him all of four days. Meaning the Alamos defenders, far from \nbeing the valiant defenders who delayed Santa Anna, pretty much died \nfor nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo why does any of this matter? Whats the harm in Texans simply \nembracing a myth?\u0014\n\u0014\nCensus data indicates that Latinos are poised to become a majority of \nthe Texas population any year now, and for them, the Alamo has long \nbeen viewed as a symbol of Anglo oppression. The fact that many \nTejanos  Texas Latinos allied with the Americans, and fought and \ndied alongside them at the Alamo, has generally been lost to popular \nhistory. The Tejanos key contributions to early Texas were written \nout of almost all early Anglo-authored histories, much as Anglo \nTexans ran Tejanos out of San Antonio and much of South Texas after \nthe revolt. For too long, the revolt has been viewed by many as a war \nfought by all Anglos against all of Mexican descent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf youre looking at the Alamo as a kind of state religion, this is \nthe original sin, says San Antonio art historian Ruben Cordova. We \nkilled Davy Crockett.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a lesson many Latinos in the state dont learn until mandatory \nTexas history classes taught in seventh grade. The way I explain \nit, says Andres Tijerina, a retired history professor in Austin, is \nMexican-Americans [in Texas] are brought up, even in the first grade, \nsinging the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance and all \nthat, and its not until the seventh grade that they single us out as \nMexicans. And from that point on, you realize youre not an American. \nYoure a Mexican, and always will be. The Alamo story takes good, \nsolid, loyal little American kids and it converts them into Mexicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Mexican-American history isnt the only piece of the past thats \ndistorted by the Alamo myth. Academic researchers long tiptoed around \nthe issue of slavery in Texas; active research didnt really begin \nuntil the 1980s. Since then, scholars such as Randolph Campbell and \nAndrew Torget have demonstrated that slavery was the single issue \nthat regularly drove a wedge between early Mexican \ngovernmentsdedicated abolitionists alland their American colonists \nin Texas, many of whom had immigrated to farm cotton, the provinces \nonly cash crop at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis correspondence shows conclusively that Stephen F. Austin, the \nso-called Father of Texas, spent years jousting with the Mexico \nCity bureaucracy over the necessity of enslaved labor to the Texas \neconomy. Nothing is wanted but money, he wrote in a pair of 1832 \nletters, and Negros are necessary to make it. Each time a Mexican \ngovernment threatened to outlaw slavery, many in Austins colony \nbegan packing to go home. In time, as we know now, they put away \ntheir suitcases and brought out their guns.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis, by and large, is not the Texas history many of us learned in \nschool; instead, we learned a tale written by Anglo historians \nbeginning in the 19th century. What happened in the past cant \nchange. But the way we view it doesand, as a state and a country, \nnow is the time to teach the next generation our history, not our \nmyths.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBryan Burrough and Jason Stanford are, with Chris Tomlinson, the \nauthors of Forget the Alamo: The Rise and Fall of an American Myth\u0014",

    "title": "ORIGIN OF THE SADDUCEES",
    "words": "Origin of the Sadducees\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the great Torah leaders in the early days of the Second Temple \nwas Antigonus of Sokho. He was wont to say, Do not be like servants \nwho serve God on the condition of receiving reward. Rather, be like \nservants who serve God without expecting reward (Avos 1:3).\u0014\n\u0014\nAntigonus had two followers named Zadok and Boethus who interpreted \nhis words as meaning that there was no reward or punishment, no \nWorld-to-Come (Avos DRabbi Nathan 5). If you do Gods will, fine. If \nyou do not, nothing bad will happen to you. God does not reward or \npunish.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was also a basic idea of Hellenism. Events happened at random. \nThere was no reward or punishment; what you did made no difference in \nthe long run. Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die, because \nwhat is the difference?\u0014\n\u0014\nZadok and Boethus interpretation aligned with Hellenistic \ntendencies, not Judaism. The belief in the Hereafter is central to \nJudaism, which posits a God who cares and who dispenses ultimate \nreward and punishment in a World-to-Come. A persons soul does not \njust end at bodily death. Zadok and Boethus rejected those basic \nJewish ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir Party Platform\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was one thing to have those ideas, but it was another thing to \ninitiate a whole movement based on those ideas and call it Judaism. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheir followers became known as the Sadducees (after Zadok) or the \nBoethusians (after Boethus).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three planks of their party platform were:\u0014\n\tNo life hereafter; no reward and punishment\u0014\n\tThere is no such thing as the Oral Tradition\u0014\n\tThe priestly class is the ruling class.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second thing they said was that there was no such thing as the \nOral Tradition. It was an invention of the rabbis and every \ngeneration had the right to reinterpret it. Of course, it was a \ncatch-22: if they could throw what their predecessors held sacred, \nthen those after them could do the same with their interpretations  \nwhich is what will happen. From Christianity onward the Written Torah \nwill become the most re-interpreted, and, at the same time, \nmisinterpreted book in history. Christianity itself would spawn \ncountless factions, each claiming to possess the gospel truth, the \ndivine interpretation. Islam would also come along and claim to have \ntrumped the Christians, possessing the true interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sadducees started a whole domino effect of human interpretations \nwhich took the meaning of the text away from its Divine origins. They \nhad an agenda in doing so. Undermining the authority of the Oral \nTorah undermined the authority of the Torah sages and the Sanhedrin. \nThat fit in with their next ideological plank, which was that the \ncontrol of the government should lie not in the hands of the \nSanhedrin, but in hands of the priestly class.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasically, the Sanhedrin was democratic, because Torah is democratic. \nOne does not require a pedigree to be a scholar. Respect for Torah is \nnot dependent upon wealth or status. In fact, the Talmud says: Be \ncareful regarding the poor because from them Torah will emerge. \nTorah comes from the humble classes. Torah is egalitarian. It is open \nfor anyone who wants it bad enough. Some of the greatest scholars in \nJewish history were converts and people living well below the poverty \nlevel. The Sages of Israel were not born with a golden spoon in their \nmouths.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, the Sadducees preached the philosophy of the \naristocracy. The upper classes were the only ones that knew enough to \nrun the country. The masses did not know anything. You did not have \nto ask their opinion. In that regard, they became heirs of the \nHellenists, who preached the same ideology.\u0014",

Not far from the walls of the Old City of \nJerusalem, they found what is considered to be one of the oldest bits \nof Scripture that exists in the world, more than 400 years older than \nthe Dead Sea Scrolls. It dates from the time just before the \ndestruction of the first temple, the Temple of Solomon, in 586 B.C. \nThe scorched ground yielded two rolled-up silver amulets that are on \ndisplay to this day in the Israel Museum. When painstakingly \nunfurled, the text was almost verbatim to the Bible verses:\u0014\n\u0014\nMay God bless you and keep you.\u0014\nMay Gods face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\u0014\nMay God turn His face toward you and give you peace (Numbers \n6:24-26).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the priestly blessing, one parents recite for their children \neach Friday night, a fervent prayer for the future. In other words, \nthe oldest bit of scripture that exists in the world is a blessing of \npeace that was snatched from hell.

    "words": "A Lesson of the Holocaust: One Person Can Make All the Difference\u0014\n\u0014\nBY GIDEON TAYLOR AND DANI DAYAN JANUARY 27, 2022  TIME MAGAZINE\u0014\nTaylor is President of the Claims Conference. Dayan is Chairman of \nYad Vashem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe saw a child in mortal danger. We knew that we had the possibility \nto take her and to protect [her], and it was beyond our feeling or \nthinking that we would reject it, Andrzej Sitkowski thought back to \nwhen he was 15 and his entire family mobilized to save two Jewish \ngirls and later their mother. It was the height of World War II in \nGermany, and the Jewish family certainly would be caught if Andrzejs \nfamily did not intervene. But taking them in meant certain death if \nthe Nazis found them out. I thought that what we did was normalwe \ndid not say we wanted to save Jews. It came by coincidence. But in \nthis coincidence, we found ourselves to be menschlich [human].\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir example and those of many others should be a lesson to the \nworld. This week, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against \nGermany (Claims Conference), in partnership with Yad Vashem, the \nWorld Holocaust Remembrance Center, is launching #DontBeABystander: \nThose who Risked Everything to Save a Life. Our goal is to highlight \npeople like Andrzeja group of people we must learn from while we \nstill have their first-hand accountsthose who were recognized as \nRighteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for their heroic wartime \nactions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe title Righteous Among the Nations, has, over the past sixty \nyears, become one of the most esteemed titles of modern history. At \nthe core of the word Righteous is the basic human value, the right \nto live. These rescuers recognized this and stood up in the face of \nimmense danger to protect the right to live of their Jewish \nneighbors. They refused to be a bystander and risked everything, \nincluding their own lives and the lives of their families, to save \nJews during the Holocaust. Like so many of the ordinary people who \ndid nothing to stop the Nazis, and in many instances willinglyeven \neagerlyjoined the Nazis in their cruel and murderous campaigns, the \nRighteous Among the Nations were also ordinary peopleyet they \nchose to undertake extraordinary actions. Yad Vashem describes them: \nSome acted out of political, ideological or religious convictions; \nothers were not idealists, but merely human beings who cared about \nthe people around them. In many cases they never planned to become \nrescuers, and were totally unprepared for the moment in which they \nhad to make such a far-reaching and fatalistic decision. They were \nordinary human beings, and it is precisely their humanity that \ntouches us and should serve as a model.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the past 77 years, since the end of World War II Holocaust \nsurvivors have not only have sought a measure of justice for the \nhorrors they and their loved ones endured, but they have also \ndedicated their lives to telling the world what happened. They do so \nto offer their testimonies as much as their moral authority, urging \nus all to remain on high alert so that such atrocities never occur \nagain. And they do so to remind us that the Holocaust wasnt \ninevitable. It happened because as the late Nobel Laureate Prof. \nElie Wiesel so memorably told usthe world knew, but remained silent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the number of collaborators in Nazi Germanys murderous \ncampaign was all too high, far more people simply stood by as six \nmillion of their Jewish friends, neighbors and citizens were \nmarginalized, ostracized, stripped of their homes and livelihoods, \nforced into ghettos, enslaved and murdered. Prof. Wieselwho survived \nthe Auschwitz death camp and whose entire family was slaughtered in \nthe Holocaustvowed to never be silent whenever and wherever human \nbeings endure suffering and humiliation. He made it his lifes \nmission to teach us all that neutrality helps the oppressor, never \nthe victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. \nSometimes we must interfere. Where individuals or groups are \npersecuted, that place mustat that momentbecome the center of the \nuniverse.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, many have forgotten (and many never even knew) who Elie Wiesel \nwas, or what he stood for. Recent surveys conducted by the Claims \nConference on Holocaust awareness in the United States, France, \nCanada, Austria and the U.K. have shown troubling gaps in knowledge \nof basic Holocaust facts. More recently, we have seen how far too \nmany people now question whether the Holocaust happened at all or \nbelieve that its catastrophic events have been widely exaggerated. \nAnd maybe it is such willful ignorance that helps ease a conscience \nthat might otherwise be troubled by inaction in the face of \nmodern-day persecution and oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut many Holocaust survivors know firsthand that they are here \ntodayas are their children, grand-children and \ngreat-grandchildrenbecause a Righteous rescuer chose to act upon a \ntroubled conscience and extend a lifesaving hand. Rescuers like \nAndrzej Sitkowski who, with his mother, Helena, saved many Jews \nincluding the Kosak sisters, Marion and Hadassah, forging a bond that \nstill exists between the two families today. And rescuers like the \nKrynskis, farmers who saved Sidney Zoltaks family from certain death \nby hiding them in an underground bunker for 14 months.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn International Holocaust Remembrance Day--or any other day--let us \nlisten to these survivors and to their rescuers, who have honored us \nby sharing their painful memories and who, simply put, knew how \nimportant it was not to be a bystander.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of us have asked ourselves whether we would act with grace, \nkindness and selflessness in the face of oppression, hatred and \ndanger. May we find the courage to learn from the actions of these \nrescuersRighteous Among the Nationsthe innocent lives that they \nsaved, and the generations who were allowed to flourish because of \ntheir brave actions.\u0014",

    "words": "ONCE A SLAVE, AMANDA SMITH'S FAITH BROUGHT HER WORLDWIDE FAME\u0014\n\u0014\nI WILL PRAY once more, said Amanda to herself, and if there is any \nsuch thing as salvation, I am determined to have it this afternoon or \ndie. It was 1856. She set the dinner table and went to the cellar to \npray, half expecting that her family would find her dead, because she \nhad prayed before without receiving assurance of acceptance with God. \nShe had even overcome deep reluctance and gone to the altar at her \nchurch, but came away as miserable as when she went. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the cellar, her prayers once again seemed futile. Finally, in \ndesperation and believing that God would strike her dead because she \nhad promised to get saved or die, she looked up and said, O, Lord, \nif Thou wilt help me I will believe Thee. In the act of telling God \nthat she would, she came to belief. O, the peace and joy that \nflooded my soul! she said. From that day forward, Amanda had two \nambitions in life: to know God better and to tell others about him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn a slave in Maryland in 1837, Amanda was freed when she was \nthree. Her family moved to Pennsylvania and their home became a \nstation on the Underground Railroad. Amanda witnessed terrifying \nincidents when slave trackers demanded fugitivesor caught them. One \nof Amandas free-born sisters was sold into slavery while visiting an \naunt in Maryland. Amanda had to borrow $50 to buy her back. Given \nthese experiences, she knew slavery, and when she experienced \nsalvation in Christ, she praised God that she had been freed twice.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, she was unwise and even disobedient. O, I would God I had \nalways obeyed Him, then would my peace have flowed as the river, but \nmany times I failed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore her conversion, she had married a man who was kind to herwhen \nhe was sober. He went to war and never returned. Because Amanda \nwanted to share the gospel, she next married a deacon who promised to \nbecome an evangelist. He was lying and he eventually abandoned her. \nShe realized that she had not cleared the marriage with the Lord. As \na consequence, she experienced poverty and had to work long hours, \nstarving herself so her children might eat. This taught her to bring \nevery detail of her day to the Lord in prayer. All but one of her \nchildren died in infancy, the result of lying in damp rooms while \nAmanda sweated over laundry. The one daughter who reached adulthood \ndied in her early twenties.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Sunday in 1868, Amanda felt impelled to go hear John Inskip \npreach. She believed Inskips claim that God could bring every \nthought and action into subjection to Him, and asked God for this. \nWaves of joy flooded her soul. Although she was the only black person \nin the church and afraid of white people, she shouted aloud. On the \nway home she also found courage to tell some haughty black women what \nthe Spirit had done for her: And they were speechless.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmanda believed that she was led by the Holy Spirit. Around 1869, the \nLord instructed her to go to a fair. She questioned this impulse as \nshe was not a fair-goer, but she went, praying for direction. I got \nup and went and stood at the top of the stairs where the people were \ncoming up . . . then came two young men full of glee. The Spirit \nseemed to pick out one especially, and said, Speak to that young \nman. She did, but he respectfully brushed her aside. All night she \nfelt that she must pray for him. The next morning she learned he had \ndied.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year following her sanctification, Amanda received a command from \nthe Lord to preach. Women preachers were not yet widely acceptedmuch \nless black women. Yet, dressed plainly in Quaker-like garb, she began \nspeaking in African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches. Her stirring \nsongs, her vivid testimonies and her obvious faith spurred many \nothers to seek salvation and sanctification. White people invited her \nas a speaker to their camp meetings. Soon she had invitations from \naround the world. This self-educated ex-slave went on to win souls on \nfive continents and to challenge Christians to live lives consistent \nwith their beliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nBishop James M. Thoburn of Bombay asserted that he learned more from \nAmanda that was of actual value to him as a preacher than from any \nother person he ever met. After her foreign travels she worked for \neight years as a missionary in Liberia and West Africa, where revival \nbroke out. The people came from all directions. We went on for two \nweeks without a break. We had several all-night meetings. . . . Some \nold men were converted that were never known to pray or be serious \nbefore. Amanda did not return to the States until 1890, when \nmalaria, rheumatism, and arthritis made it impractical for her to \nlabor in Africa. She was fifty-three years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nOld age and ill health did not shelve Amanda. After writing her \nautobiography, which was published in 1893, she opened a home in \nChicago for black orphans. To raise support for it, she returned to \npreaching and singing in churches. She died in on this day, 24 \nFebruary 1915, of a paralytic stroke at the age of seventy-eight. Her \nautobiography, with its homey details of her struggle for survival \nand hunger for holiness, became a classic in womens studies and is \nan inspiring glimpse into the mind of a soul that sought God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "ORIGEN, CHURCH FATHER",
    "words": "Origen\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL 2010, 28 Apr\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you ever known a teenager who loved Christ so much that he was \neager to die for him? A man so brilliant that he kept seven \nsecretaries busy recording his torrent of thought? Someone so eager \nto walk close to the Lord that he fasted every Wednesday and Friday? \nOrigen was such a person, a saintly man of rare brilliance, an author \nof thousands of works.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Origen?\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Alexandria, Egypt about 185, Origen was reared in a Christian \nhome. His father, Leonides, sent him to the best teachers in town and \nhad his son memorize Scripture every day. When Leonides went to \nprison for his faith about 202, Origen encouraged him not to deny \nChrist. He planned to surrender himself to the authorities so that he \ncould join his father in prison, but his mother hid his clothes. \nLeonides was martyred and his property confiscated, leaving the \nfamily destitute.\u0014\n\u0014\nA wealthy woman assisted Origen; he was able to teach the Greek \nlanguage and copy manuscripts for a living. When the young man was \nabout 18, the Bishop of Alexandria made him head of a church school \nin Alexandria. Origen was responsible to instruct new converts. He \nsoon found that he needed to answer the arguments of heretics, Jews, \nand pagans. He studied with a leading philosopher in order to learn \nhow to refute pagan arguments against the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo remove any hint of scandal as he taught young women their \ncatechism, Origen castrated himself, literally following Matthew \n19:12. He later realized that his action was ill-advised and not to \nbe taken as an example. Origen also strictly followed Christ's words \nin Matthew 10:10--he had only one coat, no shoes, and took no thought \nfor the next day. He refused gifts or pay from his pupils, ate no \nmeat, drank no wine, and slept on the bare floor. Much of the night \nhe spent in prayer and study. He helped friends and pupils when they \nwent to prison for their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrigen's First Principles\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his early years at Alexandria, Origen wrote On First \nPrinciples, the first systematic theology ever produced. For 28 years \nhe worked on another book, the Hexapla, a massive work of Old \nTestament textual analysis. He was one of the few churchmen before \nthe Reformation who learned Hebrew to assist his study of the Old \nTestament. Origen's method of interpreting Scripture tremendously \ninfluenced the Middle Ages. He found three levels of meaning in it: \nthe literal, the moral and the allegorical. He used allegory to \nreveal Christ in the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nParadoxically, Origen can be called both a father of orthodoxy and a \nheretic. He wrote at a time when the church was defining its basic \ndoctrines. His contributions have helped theologians for centuries. \nBut his active mind also led him into speculations that the Church \nrejected. In fact, church councils held in 231 and 232 enacted \nmotions against Origen, and excommunicated him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrigen found refuge in Palestine and Arabia. The faith was still dear \nto him. During a third century persecution, pagans threw him into \nprison. Tortured and condemned to die, only the death of Emperor \nDecian saved him from execution. But Origen's health was broken. He \nwas close to 70 when he died in 253 or 254.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he made serious mistakes, Origen's contribution was \ninestimable. One of his students, the church father Gregory of \nNazianzus, aptly summed him up as \"the stone that sharpens us all.\" \nBecause no definite dates are associated with Origen's life, we have \nchosen this day, April 22, to recognize his contribution to the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's Glimpses #54.\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY",
    "words": "ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY\u0014\n \u0014\nHistory shows that when brave souls dare to rock the boat by exposing \nwrongdoing in the church, they are usually the ones called \ntroublemakers rather than the actual wrongdoers. That was the \nexperience of Orange Scott and his associates in the Methodist \nEpiscopal Church. When they spoke against slave-owning, their church \ntried to silence them.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly on, American Methodists had taken a strong stand against \nslavery. However, many southern Methodists owned slaves. Even some \npastors held humans in bondage. In order to maintain the union of \nnorthern and southern churches, northern Methodists largely swept the \nissue out of sight, or called for gradual emancipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrange Scott became a Christian in 1820 when he was twenty-one years \nold. Within six months he was preaching throughout New England. \nRevivals followed wherever he went. Largely self-taught, he gathered \nknowledge by reading and attending lectures. Not until 1833 did he \nencounter serious arguments against slavery. Within months he was \ndenouncing it as a great evil; and he encouraged others to demand \nimmediate abolition. Warned that his vocal opposition would make \nenemies and harm his prospects for advancement, he replied, What I \ndo is from a sense of duty. If the declaration and defense of \nanti-slavery sentiments make me unpopular, then I am willing to be \nunpopular. My course is onward.\u0014\n \u0014\nIn sermons and lectures, he entreated his listeners to respect the \nimage of God in the enslaved. He urged them not to do to others what \nthey would not like done to themselves. He reminded them that the \nBible commands us to give our servants what is fair. And because God \ncalls himself the God of the oppressed, it is not wise to be an \noppressor. God does not play favorites.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the next nine years, Methodists from the south and bishops from \nNew England joined to attack him relentlessly. They slandered him and \nstripped him of his position of leadership. Every effort Scott and \nhis allies made to effect change was either voted down or killed with \nprocedural motions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, in 1842, joined by LaRoy Sunderland and Jotham Horton, he \nleft the Methodists. Soon others joined him. On this day, 31 May \n1843, Orange Scott presided over a convention at Utica, New York, to \nestablish the Wesleyan Methodist Connection.

    "words": "Oberlin's Awkward Proposal Resulted in Marriage\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nTake her for your wife.\" The voice in John Frederick Oberlin was \ninsistent. He believed it was God speaking to him. Yet he protested.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is impossible. Our dispositions and our tastes are so different.\" \nFrederick (for so he was called) was careful not to waste a penny or \na minute; and he was ironical. His sister's friend Madeline was \nlively and charming with habits he considered frivolous. Expense was \na real concern to Frederick. His three little parishes in the \nAlsatian mountains were dirt-poor. Knowing that he would have to make \nthe most of very little, he had adopted as his principle, \"The best \nwork for me is where I can do the most good with the least pay.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nElegant, city-bred Madeline was visiting Frederick's sister to take \nfresh mountain air after an illness. Frederick talked with her and \nwatched. Courteously he corrected her faults. Madeline answered with \nspirit and held her own with the well-educated pastor. On several \noccasions Frederick heard her say she would never marry a pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick wasn't particularly looking for a wife. His mother had \ntried to marry him off before he left Strasbourg for Schliethen. \nFrederick asked God for a sign in each case. The signs were not met \nso he stayed single. His sister Sophie accompanied him as his \nhousekeeper.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow his heart told him he should ask Madeline to marry him. Again he \nasked for a sign. Only if Madeline accepted him at once would he go \nthrough with marriage. After a sleepless night, he approached her \nwith this awkward proposal: \"You are about to leave us, my dear \nfriend: I have had an impression that you are destined by the Divine \nwill, to be the partner of my life. If you can be resolved upon this \nstep, so important to us both, I expect you will give me your honest \nopinion about it before you go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMadeline blushed. Covering her eyes with one hand, she stepped \nforward and put the other in Frederick's hands. They were married on \nthis day July 6, 1768.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd a good marriage it proved to be. In one of the most extraordinary \neducational success stories of all time, Frederick used every means \nto improve the lot of the poor villagers, usually over their \nsuspicious objections. With Madeline anchoring him, he was able to \naccomplish an extraordinary amount of work. He led the way in \nconstructing a road and bridge to the outside world and demonstrated \nproper methods of farming. He made his \"worthless\" parsonage land \nbloom with fine fruit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadeline identified completely with his goals, even voluntarily \noffering her precious earrings to help support an educational \nministry of which he greatly approved. The pair established schools \nand orphanages. When peasant wives resisted making cloth to \nsupplement their incomes, Madeline set the example by practicing the \ncraft.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their wedding Frederick had written a prayer. \"May we love each \nother only in thee [God the Father] and in our Savior Jesus Christ, \nas being members of his body.\" He also prayed that the two of them \nmight die with one another. After sixteen years of marriage, Madeline \ndied. Frederick pleaded with tears to be taken, too, but he lived on \nfor many more years. He was a long time overcoming his grief and \nnever remarried.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBeard, Augustus Field. The Story of John Frederick Oberlin.

    "title": "ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY",
    "words": "ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY\u0014\n \u0014\nHISTORY SHOWS that when brave souls dare to rock the boat by exposing \nwrongdoing in the church, they are usually the ones called \ntroublemakers rather than the actual wrongdoers. That was the \nexperience of Orange Scott and his associates in the Methodist \nEpiscopal Church. When they spoke against slave-owning, their church \ntried to silence them. Early on, American Methodists had taken a \nstrong stand against slavery. However, many southern Methodists owned \nslaves. Even some pastors held humans in bondage. In order to \nmaintain the union of northern and southern churches, northern \nMethodists largely swept the issue out of sight, or called for \ngradual emancipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrange Scott became a Christian in 1820 when he was twenty-one years \nold. Within six months he was preaching throughout New England. \nRevivals followed wherever he went. Largely self-taught, he gathered \nknowledge by reading and attending lectures. Not until 1833 did he \nencounter serious arguments against slavery. Within months he was \ndenouncing it as a great evil; and he encouraged others to demand \nimmediate abolition. Warned that his vocal opposition would make \nenemies and harm his prospects for advancement, he replied, What I \ndo is from a sense of duty. If the declaration and defense of \nanti-slavery sentiments make me unpopular, then I am willing to be \nunpopular. My course is onward. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn sermons and lectures, he entreated his listeners to respect the \nimage of God in the enslaved. He urged them not to do to others what \nthey would not like done to themselves. He reminded them that the \nBible commands us to give our servants what is fair. And because God \ncalls himself the God of the oppressed, it is not wise to be an \noppressor. God does not play favorites.\u0014\nFor the next nine years, Methodists from the south and bishops from \nNew England joined to attack him relentlessly. They slandered him and \nstripped him of his position of leadership. Every effort Scott and \nhis allies made to effect change was either voted down or killed with \nprocedural motions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, in 1842, joined by LaRoy Sunderland and Jotham Horton, he \nleft the Methodists. Soon others joined him. On this day, 31 May \n1843, Orange Scott presided over a convention at Utica, New York, to \nestablish the Wesleyan Methodist Connection. Representatives from ten \nregions of the United States attended. The new church was antislavery \nand structured without bishops and superintendents.   \u0014\nScott published the Connections journal and managed its book supply. \nAlready suffering from tuberculosis, he struggled on with the work \nfor four years, dying in 1847 at the young age of forty-seven.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis associate Luther C. Matlack wrote, He identified himself with \n[the antislavery] cause at a time when to do so involved the loss of \nreputation, property, influence, and sometimes of life itselfwhen \nabolitionists were everywhere denounced as incendiaries and fanatics, \nand proscribed alike in the social circle, in the church, and in the \nState.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesleyan Methodist churches proliferated. Scott saw the groups \nnumbers multiply before his death, and it continues to thrive to this \nday, with over a million members in one hundred countries. The Orange \nMovement to end all human trafficking worldwide took its name from \nScott.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

On the evening of April 18, \n1775, the Patriot leader rode from Boston to Lexington, \nMassachusetts, warning the rebelling colonists that British soldiers \nstationed in Boston were planning to march into the countryside \nsurrounding Lexington and Concord. However, while Reveres midnight \nride was, in fact, a significant moment in the American Revolution, \nsome details that found their way into the popular retelling have \nbeen subject to a bit of dramatic embellishment. Namely, Revere never \nactually shouted the now-legendary warning, The British are coming! \nIn fact, if he had shouted this, it would have been detrimental to \nhis mission.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor one, at the time, colonists still considered themselves to be \nBritish subjects, and although they were rebelling against the \nBritish crown, American revolutionaries did not consider the \nBritish'' to be a separate, hostile nation. Whats more, as a known \nrevolutionary agent riding through a region full of British troops, \nRevere needed to complete his ride with as much discretion as \npossible. His actual journey was one of secrecy and narrow escapes, \nincluding a clandestine boat ride across the Charles River, during \nwhich he narrowly avoided capture from a British patrol ship before \ncontinuing his covert ride by horseback on the other side of the \nriver. Revere did deliver crucial warnings about the British \nmilitarys impending advance on Lexington, but these warnings were \nquietly given to revolutionaries at individual households along his \nroute.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory Facts\u0014",

    "title": "ORPHANS PREFERRED--A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Reviewed by Clyde Milner\u0014\n\u0014\nGood stories may provide good history, but sometimes the best stories \ndo not. Christopher Corbett understands that the saga of the Pony \nExpress produced a profusion of colorful tales. A vivid set of \neccentric characters created these fabrications, and some even knew \nof what they wrote or spoke. The short eighteen-month operation of \nthe Pony Express in 1860-61 spawned spurious accounts that supported \na cast of legendary figures. Some notables such as William F. Cody \n(Buffalo Bill) and Broncho Charlie Miller (The Last of the Pony \nExpress Riders) either substantially inflated, or totally falsified, \ntheir days in the saddle delivering the mail.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Corbett provides both a judicious history of the Pony \nExpress and a history of its injudicious misrepresentation. Both \naccounts make for delightful reading. The first half of the book \nconsiders the history of the Pony Express as best it can be told \nwhereas the second half presents the accounts and characters that \nhave stretched the truth. Business records for the Central Overland \nCalifornia & Pikes Peak Express Company, the initial formal name of \nthe Pony, have not survived. But ample memories have, including the \nreminiscences of one of the founding partners, Alexander Majors. In \nfact, Majors certified William F. Codys claim that he rode for the \nPony Express. Buffalo Bills Wild West show had a dashing Pony \nExpress horseman as a prominent feature. Also, Cody paid for the \npublication, in 1893, of Majorss memoir, Seventy Years on the \nFrontier. In his own ghost-written autobiography, Buffalo Bill \nclaimed, Excitement was plentiful during my two years service as a \nPony Express rider. And exciting it must have been with the addition \nof six extra months to the life of the Pony. Eventually, as Corbett \nnotes, a meticulous scholar, John S. Gray, determined that for two \nmonths in the summer of 1857, as a young eleven-year-old lad, Cody \ndelivered messages for the freighting firm of Russell, Majors, and \nWaddell within a three-mile radiusof Leavenworth, Kansas. \nAlexander Majors remembered the boy and expanded on the legend of the \nman; Buffalo Bill may never have saddled up for the Pony.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, authentic heroes did ride for the Pony Express, most prominently \nPony Bob Haslam, whose exploits fill an entire chapter of Corbetts \nbook. Equally fascinating, but less credible, are the declarations of \nBroncho Charlie Miller. He became a darling of the New York City \nnewspapers with his preferred spelling of his nickname, his tricks \nwith a bullwhip, and his claim to be the last of the Pony Express \nriders. He lived until 1955 when he supposedly reached the age of \n105.  Many people out West questioned his legitimacy, but few in New \nYork could resist his colorful stories about meeting Wild Bill \nHickok, Jesse James, Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley and Abraham Lincoln.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Corbett writes with humor and affection about the people \nwho have asserted special knowledge of  and personal connections to \n the saga of the Pony Express. His book will remind readers of how \nsome stories take on a life of their own with only the slightest \nrelationship to historical events. 256 pages  61/8\" x 91/4\"  \nchapter-opening photos\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: CHRISTOPHER CORBETT, a former news editor and \nreporter with the Associated Press, Corbett has also written for The \nNew York Times, The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and \nThe Boston Globe.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER: Clyde A.

    "words": "Once a Village, Now Nothing: Even the Bodies Are Gone\u0014\nBy IAN FISHER\u0014\n\u0014\nCALANG, Indonesia, Jan. 13/ 05 - This town was not just destroyed. It \nvanished.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter almost three weeks, only 323 bodies have been found. Before \nDec. 26, when the tsunami swept in from both sides of the pretty \ntropical peninsula that once cradled Calang, 7,300 people lived here. \nThere is no hint of the 5,627 people missing, and the reality is \nsettling in that 8 in 10 people in Calang were whisked clean away.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It seems impossible,\" said a student here, Suhardi, 20, still \ndumbstruck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe waves left little behind, not people and not houses. There is, in \nfact, almost nothing left to see. Concrete foundations were stripped \nbare. There is some rubble, though far less than might be expected \ngiven that every home, coffee shop, fish restaurant and mosque was \nleveled, apart from one rich man's manor, now a two-story skeleton of \npartial walls and bone-white columns.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is only one,\" Col. Ikin Sodikin, an Indonesian Army officer, \nsaid as he pointed out the sole standing house. He chuckled in \nresignation, as people sometimes do in the face of things no one can \nreally grasp. \"All Calang has just disappeared,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalang is one of many villages on the western coast of Aceh Province \nwiped from the map of Indonesia, where suffering along the land \nclosest to the earthquake's epicenter has been compounded by its \nremoteness. In the next village south, Kreung Sabe, half the town's \nresidents died, and all but 500 of the 4,400 people who lived there \nbefore the tsunami are homeless. They now must walk seven miles to a \nport where relief supplies are delivered with what they say is still \nnot enough food or medicine.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust south of Kreung Sabe, a fishing village called Panga and three \nothers nearby were flattened completely, with not a single house \nstanding. In Panga itself, 793 of 1,108 people died, local leaders \nsay, in a place with no airstrip, no port and roads completely washed \nout. It took a week for the first relief to arrive. Maybe 100 bodies, \nsoldiers say, still lay around a swamp.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've been encouraging people to come get them,\" said Lt. Col. Reza \nUtama, who lost 20 of his own men stationed here. But no body bags or \nrubber gloves have been delivered, and so Colonel Utama said, \"people \nare a bit reluctant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis strip of coast southwest of the regional capital, Banda Aceh, \nitself devastated by the tsunami, appears to have suffered some of \nthe worst proportional losses on Dec. 26. In the region hit by the \nearthquake and then the tsunami, this is also one of the places that \nhelp was last to reach. And that assistance, nearly three weeks \nlater, seems both heroic and not quite enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople complain of surviving on just rice and instant noodles. A \nlocal leader in Panga, named Ismaelis, said children were suffering \nfrom fever, vomiting and diarrhea.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We don't mind being orphans if the aid is coming,\" said Sharudin, \n18, who lost his parents and four siblings. \"If the aid doesn't come, \nit would be better if we just died with our parents.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Tiimes, 1/14/05\u0014",

    "words": "Shortly after my third birthday, in the early summer of 1937, my \nfather taught me to stand up straight and raise my right arm in the \n'Heil Hitler' greeting. I laughed at first and thought we were \nplaying some kind of game but quickly realized that [he] was dead \nserious.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnyone pondering the riddle of how Adolf Hitler and his Nazi cohorts \nwere able to thoroughly insinuate themselves into the fabric of \nGerman life and society would do well to consider Irmgard Hunts \nhonest and often gripping memoir of her childhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn average familys story of life in the Reich\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Hitlers Mountain is the story of an average German family and how \nit embraced the Fuhrers dictates and demands, from 1933 until his \nReich collapsed. Specifically, it tells what it was like to be a \nchild in Nazi Germany, what it was like in school, what happened to \nvarious family members, and how they coped with the war and the death \nof Hunts father in combat. Born in 1934, Hunt grew up in the \nBavarian village of Berchtesgaden, in the shadow of The Eagles Nest, \njust outside of the fence that surrounded Hitlers alpine \nheadquarters. Her parents, like many other Germans of the time, \nconsidered themselves moral and honest, and they struggled to keep \ntheir lives together during the post-World War I Weimar Republic.\u0014\n\u0014\nHunt points out the similarity between traditional German family \nvalues and the authoritarian ethos of the Nazi party: The ground \nrules in a German family were the same as in the German state: Punish \nindependence, rebellion against orders, and speaking upinstead, \nfoster unquestioning obedience, submission, orderliness, and hard \nwork. She also tells how family members, after \"years of being made \nto feel like beggars and scumlent an eager ear to the man who told \nthem that Germany was not only a worthy nation but a superior one.\u0014\n\u0014\nPutting the Nazi imprint on age-old customs\u0014\n\u0014\nWe learn how the Nazis began to change traditional German customs and \nbeliefs, and put their imprint on traditional holidays, including \nChristmas and Easter, and instituted new holidays, including May Day, \nto honor German workers, and Hitlers BirthdayApril 20.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most notable section of the book is Hunts honest account of the \nlast months of World War II, including how her family coped with the \nproblems of everyday life immediately after the war and in the \nbeginning of American occupation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis straightforward memoir, based on family documents and stories \nprovided by surviving relatives, is a valuable addition to the \nliterature of Nazi Germany. As Irmgard Hunt states, The seemingly \npetty details of peoples lives are actually often symbolic andcan \nprovide additional understanding of what paved the way to Hitlers \nsuccess and led to wholesale disaster. 288 pages  6\" x 9\"  b&w \nphotographs\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the author: Irmgard A.

Mom Charged in Girl's Decapitation\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MATT SEDENSKY\u0014\n\u0014\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. 5/5/05 (AP) - Police charged an Oklahoma woman on \nThursday with the murder of her daughter, who had become known as \nPrecious Doe after her decapitated body was found here four years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe charge against Michelle Johnson came soon after the girl, Erica \nMichelle Maria Green, who was almost 4, was identified through a tip, \nauthorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl's body was found near an intersection on April 28, 2001, \nwith her head later found nearby, wrapped in a trash bag.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer story had deeply touched the community. ``Everyone over here is \nexcited beyond words,'' said Capt. Rich Lockhart, a spokesman for the \nKansas City Police Department.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnson, of Muskogee, Okla., was also charged with endangering the \nwelfare of a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutor Mike Sanders said Johnson was being held on $500,000 bond \nin Muskogee and would be extradited to Kansas City ``as soon as \npossible.'' He did not immediately provide any other details about \nher.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to police, Johnson and her husband were with Erica in \nKansas City when he delivered the fatal kick. Police said Johnson \ntold them the couple let the girl lay motionless for two days, \ndeciding not to seek medical care because there were warrants out for \ntheir arrests.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother told police her husband later used hedge clippers to cut \noff the girl's head. They discarded the pieces in a wooded area and a \ntrash bin, according to a probable cause statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nSanders said Johnson was being held on $500,000 bond and would be \nextradited ``as soon as possible'' to Kansas City, 240 miles north. \nHe did not immediately provide other details about her.\u0014\n\u0014\nA team of Kansas City law enforcement officers were in Muskogee on \nThursday conducting more interviews.\u0014\n\u0014\nLockhart said police got their break after a caller directed them to \nan Oklahoma couple.\u0014\n\u0014\nDetectives went to Muskogee on Wednesday to interview members of a \nfamily after getting a second tip from a man living there who said he \nwas related to the child. An initial investigation last year of a tip \nfrom the same man did not produce any solid leads.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Oklahoma man also contacted Alonzo Washington, a community \nactivist who has championed efforts to identify the black girl as he \nworks to raise awareness of missing black children.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday, Washington received a package containing a photo of the \nwoman the man said was the child's mother, pictured with several \nchildren, including one that the Oklahoma man said he believed to be \nErica. Washington gave the photo to police.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington said Thursday he was happy that Precious Doe had remained \nin the minds of police and the community. ``There's something about \nit that just bothers me that a child could be thrown away and people \nforget about it,'' he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the months after the girl's body was found, hundreds volunteered \nto answer witness hot lines and pass out fliers with her picture; \nhundreds more prayed and sang at candlelight vigils.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe quest to give the little girl a name put her story on the \n``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Today'' television shows and in \nnewspapers across the country. An advertising company donated 20 \nbillboards with her picture and the words ``Who Am I?''\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the girl was finally buried in December 2001, hundreds of \nmourners turned out for a church service that featured children \nsinging, dancing and reading Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rev. Wallace Hartsfield implored: ``Don't stop mourning. Don't be \ncomforted. Keep on crying.''\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities combed through more than 1,000 leads as community leaders \ncontinued their efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nHopes of identifying her were raised briefly the following spring, \nafter Florida child welfare officials realized that they had lost \ntrack of a girl in foster care for more than a year, but DNA tests \nshowed that Precious Doe was not that girl, 5-year-old Rilya Wilson.\u0014\n\u0014\nA makeshift memorial of poems, teddy bears and flowers to Precious \nwas eventually replaced by a permanent monument to the girl. \nT-shirts, bumper stickers and fliers with the child's picture were \npassed out on city streets and vigils were still held to honor her \nmemory.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday morning, someone had placed a sign at the memorial \nreading, ``My Name Is Erica Michelle Maria Green.''\u0014",

Although little is known about them, the \nGospel of Mark names four brothersJames, Joses, Judas, and Simon, \nand early Christian tradition identifies two sisters, Mary and \nSalome. But developing church dogma, particularly the fourth-century \nidea of Mary's \"perpetual virginity,\" gave rise to ingenious \ninterpretations of these figures, one being that brothers really \nmeant cousins.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book, The Jesus Dynasty, James Tabor argues that the men Jesus \ndesignated as his dynastic successors were his half-brothers, \nfathered not by Joseph (who disappears in Gospel accounts after the \nNativity) but by Joseph's brother, Clophas, who was obliged by Jewish \nlaw to marry his brother's widow.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what does it mean if James, killed in A.D. 62 after more than 30 \nyears as leader of the Jesus movement in Jerusalem, was the son of \nClophas and Mary? Well, for one, it further complicates a fascinating \ncontroversy over a limestone burial box purporting to contain the \nbones of James.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ossuary, supposedly found near the Old City of Jerusalem, excited \nwide interest in 2002, when Biblical Archaeological Review Editor \nHershel Shanks announced that paleographic examination of the box's \nAramaic inscriptionJames, son of Joseph, brother of Jesusproved it \nwas an authentic first-century engraving. A subsequent investigation \nby the Israel Antiquities Authority, focusing on the age of the \ninscription's patina, declared it a forgery. But leading epigraphers, \nincluding the Sorbonne's Andr Lemaire, have challenged the IAA \nfinding, and both Shanks and Tabor hint that forthcoming findings \nwill establish the authenticity of the inscription.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet if James is indeed the son of Clophas, as Tabor argues, would \nthat mean that someone called the son of Joseph could not have been \nJesus's brother? Not necessarily. Even though fathered by Joseph's \nbrother, James, Tabor writes, \"legally becomes known as the 'son of \nJoseph' after his deceased brother in order to carry on his name.\" \nWhether that proves that James was Jesus's dynastic successor, the \ninscription alone cannot say.\u0014",

Samuel \nonce prayed for the King and waited for Susannas Amen. She didnt \nsay it. I do not believe          the Prince of Orange to be the \nKing, she said spiritedly.

You are a light of the\u0014\n         world, and a tree ever green. If you have re-\u0014\n         nounced temples, make not your own gate a\u0014\n         temple. Thus did the second-century theolo-\u0014\n         gian Tertullian condemn those Christians who\u0014\n         celebrated the winter festivals or decorated\u0014\n         their houses with laurel boughs in honor of the\u0014\n         Roman emperor. The Romans decked their\u0014\n         homes with evergreen branches during the\u0014\n         New Year, and ancient inhabitants of northern\u0014\n         Europe cut evergreen treesancient symbols\u0014\n         of life in the midst of winterand planted\u0014\n         them in boxes inside. Many early Christians.\u0014\n         like Tertullian, were hostile to such practices.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         But by the early Middle Ages, a legend had\u0014\n         begun to circulate that when Christ was born\u0014\n         in the dead of winter every tree throughout the\u0014\n         world miraculously shook off its ice and snow\u0014\n         and produced new shoots of green. At the same time, \nChristian mis-\u0014\n         sionaries preaching to Germanic and Slavic peoples were \ntaking a\u0014\n         more lenient approach to cultural practices. These \nmissionaries be-\u0014\n         lieved that the Incarnation proclaimed Christs lordship \nover those\u0014\n         natural symbols that had previously been used for the \nworship of pa-\u0014\n         gan gods. Not only individual human beings, but cultures, \nsymbols,\u0014\n         and traditions could be converted.\u0014\n       \u0014\n         Of course, this did not mean that the worship of pagan gods\u0014\n         themselves was tolerated. According to one legend, the \n8th-centu-\u0014\n         ry missionary Boniface, after cutting down an oak tree \nsacred to the\u0014\n         pagan god Thor (and used for human sacrifice), pointed to a \nnearby\u0014\n         fir tree as a symbol of the love and mercy of God.\u0014\n     \u0014\n         Not until the Renaissance are there clear records of trees \nbeing\u0014\n         used as a symbol of Christmasbeginning in Latvia in 15 10 \nand\u0014\n         Strasbourg in I 521. Legend credits Martin Luther with \ninventing the\u0014\n         Christmas tree, but the story has little historical basis. \nThe most\u0014\n         plausible theory behind the 16th-century appearance of \nChristmas\u0014\n         trees links them to medieval mystery plays. These dramas \nbegan as\u0014\n         part of the churchs liturgy, but by the late Middle Ages, \nthey were\u0014\n         rowdy, imaginative performances dominated by laypeople and \ntak-\u0014\n         ing place in the open air. Mystery plays celebrating the \nNativity\u0014\n         were linked to the story of creationin part because \nChristmas\u0014\n         Eve was also considered the feast day of Adam and Eve. As \npart of\u0014\n         the mystery play for that day, the Garden of Eden was \nsymbolized\u0014\n         by a paradise tree hung with fruit.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Mystery plays were banned in many places in the 16th century.\u0014\n         It may be that people set up paradise trees in their homes \nto\u0014\n         compensate for the public celebration they could no longer \nenjoy.\u0014\n         The earliest Christmas trees (or evergreen branches) used in\u0014\n         homes were referred to as paradises. They were often hung \nwith\u0014\n         round pastry wafers symbolizing the Eucharist, which \ndeveloped in-\u0014\n         to the cookie ornaments decorating German Christmas trees to-\u0014\n         day. Our first detailed description of such a tree dates \nfrom 1605.\u0014\n\u0014\n           The custom gained popularity throughout the I 7th and 18th\u0014\n         centuries, against the protests of some clergy. Lutheran \nministerJo-\u0014\n         hann von Dannhauer, for instance, complained (like \nTertullian) that\u0014\n         the symbol distracted people from the true evergreen tree, \nJesus\u0014\n         Christ. But this did not stop many churches from setting up \nChrist-\u0014\n         mas trees inside the sanctuary. Alongside the tree often \nstood\u0014\n         wooden pyramidsstacks of shelves bearing candles, \nsometimes\u0014\n         one for each family member. Eventually these pyramids of \ncandles\u0014\n         were placed on the tree.\u0014\n\u0014\n           The Christmas tree only became common in the English-speak-\u0014\n         ing world in the 19th century, popularized in England by \nQueen Vic-\u0014\n         toria and introduced in America by German-speaking \nimmigrants.\u0014\n         Today, Christmas trees serve as a bridge between the \nChristian\u0014\n         meaning of the holiday and its often empty secular \nexpressions.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         EDWIN WOODRUFF TAIT is assistant professor of Bible and\u0014\n         religion at Huntington College in Huntington, Indiana.\u0014",

(Well, actually, I did, so \nthe following week he only used it once.)\u0014\nFace it, if a Pentagon general, his salary paid with my tax dollars, \ncan label homosexual acts as \"immoral\" without a call for his \ndismissal, who are the moral high and mighty kidding?\u0014\n\u0014\nOur nation, historically bursting with generosity toward strangers, \nremains remarkably unkind toward its own. Just under our gleaming \npatina of inclusiveness, we harbor corroding guts. America, I tell \nyou that it doesn't matter how many times you brush your teeth. If \nyour insides are rotting your breath will stink. So, how do you \npeople choose which hate to embrace, which to forgive with a wink and \na week in rehab, and which to protest? Where's my copy of that rule \nbook?\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me cite a non-volatile example of how prejudice can cohabit \nunchecked with good intentions. I am a huge fan of David Letterman's. \nI watch the opening of his show a couple of times a week and have \ndone so for decades. Without fail, in his opening monologue or skit \nMr. Letterman makes a joke about someone being fat. I kid you not. \nWill that destroy our nation? Should he be fired or lose his \nsponsors? Obviously not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I think that there is something deeper going on at the Letterman \nstudio than coincidence. And, as I've said, I cite this example \nsimply to illustrate that all kinds of prejudice exist in the human \nheart. Some are harmless. Some not so harmless. But we need to \nunderstand who we are if we wish to change. (In the interest of full \ndisclosure, I should confess to not only being a gay American, but \nalso a fat one. Yes, I'm a double winner.)\u0014\n\u0014\nI urge you to look around, or better yet, listen around and become \naware of the prejudice in everyday life. We are so surrounded by \nexpressions of intolerance that I am in shock and awe that anyone \nnoticed all these recent high-profile instances. Still, I'm gladdened \nbecause our no longer being deaf to them may signal their eventual \neradication.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe real point is that you cannot harbor malice toward others and \nthen cry foul when someone displays intolerance against you. \nPrejudice tolerated is intolerance encouraged. Rise up in \nrighteousness when you witness the words and deeds of hate, but only \nif you are willing to rise up against them all, including your own. \nOtherwise suffer the slings and arrows of disrespect silently.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarvey Fierstein is an actor and playwright.\u0014",

    "title": "ON SPECIAL DAYS - GORDON MACDONALD",
    "words": "From my journal: For most of my life, my father and I have struggled \nto connect with each other. We are very different men, and our \ndifferences have grown during the passage of the years. Nevertheless, \nthere were occasional exceptions to this distancing, and I think I \nremember almost everyone of them. They were the events when, for a \nshort while, there wasbetween him and mea sense of sublime \ncloseness.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the more memorable of those moments came when I was a second \ngrader at P.S. (Public School) 33 in New York. On a spring day \nshortly before lunch hour, my father came to the door of my \nclassroom. After a brief word with the teacher he gestured for me to \njoin him. \"Son,\" he said, \"clean off your desk and come with me.\" \nSoon after, we were walking down the hallway and out the front door \nof the school.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly when we reached the privacy of his car did my father speak again \nand disclose his real purpose in taking me out of school. \"I thought \nyou'd like to go to the ball game with me today,\" he said. Sixty \nyears later I can still see his mischievous grin as he disclosed this \nwonderful plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuse on this! You're seven or eight years old. It's the middle of a \nschool day, and your father springs you from school to see a baseball \ngame.\u0014\n\u0014\nNinety or so minutes later, my father and I, hotdogs and crackerjacks \nin hand, were in our seats along the third-base line at old Ebbits \nField in Brooklyn where Jackie Robinson, just feet away, was warming \nup to play one of his first games as a Brooklyn Dodger. Does this \nsmell like Heaven?\u0014\n\u0014\nSomewhere in the early innings of the game, a batter, the New York \nGiants' Johnny Mize, hit a towering foul ball. An instant replay deep \nin my memory recalls the trajectory of that ball going almost \nstraight up, losing its momentum and beginning its descent  right \nover my seat. Down and down and down it came. Then, when it was close \nenough for me to see the stitching on the ball, a hand (my father's \nhand!) reached out and snatched it from the air.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of my young life's ber-glorious experiences, my father handed \nthe ball to me. Given my age, the keys to a brand new Mustang \nconvertible could not have been a better gift. I was filled with \nabounding love and admiration for him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Where is the Life we have lost in living?\" T.S. Eliot once asked. It \nis quite possible that Eliot had far more ponderous notions in mind \nwhen he wrote those words that contrasted Life and living. But for me \nanyway, that afternoon spent with my father at Ebbits Field fell \ndistinctly into the Living category.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs have many more moments of joy and wonder and love and contentment. \nMy first kiss (not with my mother) comes to mind. So does winning a \nchampionship race. And so does the moment I decided to organize my \nlife around Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow about the night a very special woman said yes to my proposal of \nmarriage? And the first times I held our newborn son and, later, our \ndaughter in my arms. Then there was the day I was informed that a \nchurch actually wanted me to be its pastor. And the occasions on \nwhich I have introduced people to Jesus. And the evening a few weeks \nago when I took my oldest granddaughter out to dinner and heard her \nsay over dessert, \"I sure love talking with you, Papa.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are not only experiences that can be classified as Living; they \nare a foretaste, I think, of Heaven. You can have your mansions and \nstreets of gold. I'll take the kind of gladness that comes from going \nto the ball game with your father (especially if school is in \nsession) and from being with a grandchild who loves youand all the \nother stuff I mentioned. If Heaven's like that, sign me up.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuotes I save: \"It is only unself-conscious activity that bears \nfruit, and the man who plays a part in a historical drama never \nunderstands its true significance\" (War and Peace, Tolstoy). In other \nwords, get your mind off yourself, do the right thing, and let the \nrewards take care of themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorth reading: Genius, Grief and Grace by Dr. Gaius Davies (Guernsey \nPress). In a most thoughtful book, Davies, a psychiatrist, takes a \nhard look at faith-heroes such as C.S. Lewis, J.B. Philipps, Amy \nCarmichael, William Cowper, and D. Martin Lloyd-Jones and analyzes \nhow very difficult personal struggles shaped their view of life and \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastor and author Gordon MacDonald is chair of World Relief and \neditor at large for Leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo respond to this newsletter, write to \nNewsletter@LeadershipJournal.net.\u0014\nCopyright  2007 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Leadership Journal.\u0014",

Our book, The Twelve Steps\u0014\n         and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous, asks a \nsimilar question on page 103\u0014\n         and answers it by aligning a principle with each Step.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Step One teaches us the principle of honesty. In Step Two we \nlearn hope, and in Step\u0014\n         Three we learn faith. Steps Four and Five teach us courage \nand integrity, Step Six\u0014\n         teaches us willingness, Step Seven teaches humility, and \nSteps Eight and Nine teach\u0014\n         self-discipline and love. In working Step Ten, we learn \nperseverance and in Step Eleven,\u0014\n         spiritual awareness. Service is the underlying principle of \nStep Twelve.\u0014",

    "title": "OBSESSING OVER THE BIBLE",
    "words": "Fighting 'Bibliolatry' at the Evangelical \nTheological Society\u0014\n\u0014\nTalbot's J.P. Moreland warns that evangelicals are over-committed to \nthe Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nTed Olsen\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the ballroom sessions of the first day of the Evangelical \nTheological Society meeting had more attendees, no session was as \npacked as J.P. Morelands How Evangelicals Became Over-Committed to \nthe Bible and What Can Be Done About It. While the average breakout \nsession seems to be attended by fewer than 50 people, easily more \nthan 200 packed the room to hear Morelands talk, with dozens \nstanding and more listening outside the door.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts little wonder why so many people attended. ETS membership has \nonly two doctrinal requirements: you must affirm the Trinity and the \ninerrancy of Scripture. The first part has not been controversial of \nlate, but the second was the focus of the societys recent fight over \nopen theism and was named as a reason why Francis Beckwith could not \nremain as ETS president after his conversion to Roman Catholicism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, to accuse evangelicals of over-commitment to the Bible at \nETS would be like accusing environmentalists of talking too much \nabout climate change at a Sierra Club meeting. But Moreland, who has \ngained some prominence as a philosopher and apologist, wasnt pulling \nany punches.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the actual practices of the Evangelical community in North \nAmerica, there is an over-commitment to Scripture in a way that is \nfalse, irrational, and harmful to the cause of Christ, he said. And \nit has produced a mean-spiritedness among the over-committed that is \na grotesque and often ignorant distortion of discipleship unto the \nLord Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem, he said, is the idea that the Bible is the sole source \nof knowledge of God, morality, and a host of related important items. \nAccordingly, the Bible is taken to be the sole authority for faith \nand practice.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuppose an archaeologist discovered a portion of the ancient city of \nJerusalem that was specifically described in the Old Testament, \nMoreland said:\u0014\n\u0014\n    Could the archaeologist have discovered the site without the use \nof the Old Testament? Once discovered, could the archaeologist learn \nthings about the site that went beyond what was in the Old Testament? \nClearly the answer is yes to both questions. Why? Because the site \nactually exists in the real world. It does not exist in the Bible. It \nis only described in the Bible and the biblical description in \npartial.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, Moreland argued, because the human soul/spirit and \ndemons/angels are real, it is possible, and, in fact, actual that \nextra-biblical knowledge can be gained about these spiritual \nentities.  Demons do not exist in the Bible. They exist in reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy not researching how demons work, how to fight them, and other such \nissues by, for example, working with exorcists, Christian scholars \nare harming the church, Moreland argued. In a similar vein, he thinks \nevangelical scholars and the movement as a whole are rejecting \nguidance, revelation, and so forth from God through impressions, \ndreams, visions, prophetic words, words of knowledge and wisdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe shut that down because of charismatic excesses, he said. \nBecause of abuses, we fear teaching people how to use it. We think \nits all going to be Benny Hinn or something like that.\u0014\n\u0014\nA third area where Moreland critiqued evangelical over-commitment to \nBible was in the scarcity of evangelical appeals to natural theology \nand moral law in their political and cultural discussions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sparse landscape of evangelical political thought stands in \nstark contrast to the overflowing garden both of evangelical biblical \nscholarship and Catholic reflection on reason, general revelation, \nand cultural and political engagement, he said. We evangelicals \ncould learn a lesson or two from our Catholic friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat wasnt as provocative a statement coming a few months after the \nETS president became one of those Catholic friends. Catholicism is \non the agenda here, and Catholics are both implicitly and explicitly \ndiscussed in the meetings many discussions of justification. But \nCatholicism doesnt seem to be the new open theism at ETS.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, more provocative was Morelands argument about why evangelicals \nbecame over-committed to the Bible. Rather than developing a robust \nepistemology in response to secularism, he said, evangelicals reacted \nand retreated. Now evangelical theologians arent allowed to come to \nany new conclusions about the truths in Scripture, and theyre not \nallowed to find truths outside of Scripture. As a result, he said, \ntheyre engaged in private language games and increasingly detailed \nminutia and were not seeing work on broad cultural themes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are, quite frankly, a number of papers here that reflect \nprivate language games and increasingly detailed minutia. There will \nbe in a few days, too, at the joint meeting of the American Academy \nof Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature. And there are at \njust about every other major academic conference Ive ever attended. \nBut I think Morelands critique stung here perhaps more than it might \nelsewhere. This is a group torn between its desire to do respectable \nscholarship and its desire to serve the church. Morelands jeremiad \nhit them on both fronts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted by Ted Olsen on November 14, 2007 10:55PM\u0014\n\u0014\nA response:\u0014\n\u0014\nI must profess a certain level of amusement with these posts, since \nnone appear to be from anyone who actually attended the conference, \nsave the original article author. We are getting all fired up about \nsomeone's summary of Moreland's arguments, a summary which I assume \nis fairly accurate, but which is still just a summary. That being \nsaid, what we have in the summary is not Moreland's argument that \nScripture is not valid or normative, but rather his argument that \nother sources of knowledge may be valid and (dare I say it) normative \nas well. Truth is not relative, but truth can be found in almost \nevery major religious system or philosophy. Surely truth should be \nnormative, wherever we find it. I am not saying that other \nreligions/philosophies are wholly true, merely that truth can be \nfound in them. But when it all comes down to it, truth must be \nfounded upon the revelation of God, since He is the only one with \nauthority to so declare truth. And Scripture is by far the most \namazing and powerful revelation of God to humanity anywhere. But it \nis not the only source of revelation. And that seems to me Moreland's \npoint, at least as the summary states it. Should we weigh everything \nagainst Scripture? Absolutely. How else would we weigh it? We have no \nother sure revelation. But our understanding of that revelation can \nbe, and often is, elevated by our experiences, by some event which \nclarifies truth in a tangible way. Who was not moved by the depth of \nphysical pain shown in Gibson's \"Passion of the Christ\"? Sure, some \nwere moved to anger, and some were moved to indignation, but those \ndepictions were moving. For all who believe that the Son of God \nreally came, and really suffered at the hands of the Romans, and \nreally died, that experiential movie became a powerful catalyst to \nlove. Seeing what Jesus might have gone through pushed me toward \ngreater devotion and love. Was Gibson's movie totally biblical? By \nhis own admission, some of the dialogue and descriptions came from an \necstatic experience that a nun had in the 19th century. Does that \nmake the depiction any less true, or moving? This is, as I understand \nthe summary, what Moreland wants us to be available to. Sometimes God \nwill subvert our rational processes and strike on an emotional level. \nIt is often the only way we moderns will listen. And I, for one, say \nlet us listen more. Anything that pushes the people of God closer to \nHis heart, His real, true heart, is a good and desirable thing. Kudos \nto Moreland for his courage to push this envelope.\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted by: Fallacy, November 15, 2007\u0014",

    "title": "OBSERVANCE OF LENT THROUGH THE CENTURIES",
    "words": "From Ash Wednesday to Easter, many solemnly mark their foreheads with \nash, fasting (or abstaining from certain foods or physical \npleasures) for 40 days. This is done to supposedly imitate Jesus \nChrists 40-day fast in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1-2). Some give up \nsmoking. Others give up chewing gum. Still others give up over-eating \nor cursing. People vow to give up anything, as long as it prepares \nthem for Easter.\u0014\n\u0014\nLent was not observed by the first century Church! It was first \naddressed by the church at Rome during the Council of Nicea in A.D. \n325, when Emperor Constantine officially recognized that church as \nthe Roman Empires state religion. Any other form of Christianity \nthat held to doctrines contrary to the Roman church was considered an \nenemy of the state. In A.D. 360, the Council of Laodicea officially \ncommanded Lent to be observed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOriginally, people did not observe Lent for more than a week. Some \nkept it for one or two days. Others kept it for 40 consecutive hours, \nbelieving that only 40 hours had elapsed between Christs death and \nresurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, it became a 40-day period of fasting or abstaining from \ncertain foods. The emphasis was not so much on the fasting as on the \nspiritual renewal that the preparation for Easter demanded. It was \nsimply a period marked by fasting, but not necessarily one in which \nthe faithful fasted every day. However, as time went on, more and \nmore emphasis was laid upon fastingDuring the early centuries (from \nthe fifth century on especially) the observance of the fast was very \nstrict. Only one meal a day, toward evening was allowed: flesh meat \nand fish, and in most places even eggs and dairy products, were \nabsolutely forbidden. Meat was not even allowed on Sundays (Catholic \nEncyclopedia).\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the ninth century onward, Lents strict rules were relaxed. \nGreater emphasis was given to performing penitential works than to \nfasting and abstinence. According to the apostolic constitution \nPoenitemini of Pope Paul IV (Feb. 17, 1966), abstinence is to be \nobserved on Ash Wednesday and on all Fridays of the year that do not \nfall on holy days of obligation, and fasting as well as abstinence is \nto be observed on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday (Catholic \nEncyclopedia).\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Lent is used for fasting from sin and from viceforsaking sin \nand sinful ways. It is a season for penance, which means sorrow for \nsin and conversion to God. This tradition teaches that fasting and \nemploying self-discipline during Lent will give a worshipper the \ncontrol over himself that he needs to purify his heart and renew his \nlife.\u0014",

Up in the sky a \nthousand white dots\u0014\ncome screeching and squawking, winging their way toward that lanky \nframe standing there on the end of the pier.  Before long, dozens of \nseagulls have enveloped him, their wings fluttering and flapping \nwildly.\u0014\n\u0014\n Ed stands there tossing shrimp to the hungry birds.\u0014\n\u0014\n As he does, if you listen closely, you can hear him say with a \nsmile, \"Thank you. Thank you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n In a few short minutes the bucket is empty. But Ed doesn't leave.\u0014\n\u0014\n He stands there lost in thought, as though transported to another \ntime and place.\u0014\n Invariably, one of the gulls lands on his sea-bleached, \nweather-beaten hat - an old military hat he's been wearing for years.\u0014\n\u0014\n When he finally turns around and begins to walk back toward the \nbeach, a few of the birds hop along the pier with him until he gets \nto the stairs, and then they, too, fly away.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd old Ed quietly makes his way down to the end of the beach and on \nhome. If you were sitting there on the pier with your fishing line in \nthe water, Ed might seem like \"a funny old duck,\" as my dad used to \nsay.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr, \"a guy that's one sandwich shy of a picnic,\" as my kids might say.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo onlookers, he's just another old codger, lost in his own weird \nworld, feeding the seagulls with a bucket full of shrimp.\u0014\n\u0014\n To the onlooker, rituals can look either very strange or very empty. \nThey can seem altogether unimportant ....maybe even a lot of nonsense.\u0014\n\u0014\n Old folks often do strange things, at least in the eyes of Boomers \nand Busters.  Most of them would probably write Old Ed off, down \nthere in Florida. That's too bad. They'd do well to know him better.\u0014\n\u0014\n His full name: Eddie Rickenbacker.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a famous hero back in World War II. On one of his flying \nmissions across the Pacific, he and his seven-member crew went down. \nMiraculously, all of the men survived, crawled out of their plane, \nand climbed into a life raft.\u0014\n\u0014\n Captain Rickenbacker and his crew floated for days on the rough \nwaters of the Pacific.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey fought the sun. They fought sharks. Most of all, they fought \nhunger.By the eighth day their rations ran out. No food. No water. \nThey were hundreds of miles from land and no one knew where they were.\u0014\n\u0014\n They needed a miracle. That afternoon they had a simple devotional \nservice and prayed for a miracle.\u0014\nThey tried to nap. Eddie leaned back and pulled his military cap over \nhis nose. Time dragged. All he could hear was the slap of the waves \nagainst the raft.\u0014\n\u0014\n Suddenly, Eddie felt something land on the top of his cap. It was a \nseagull!.\u0014\n\u0014\n Old Ed would later describe how he sat perfectly still, planning his \nnext move.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a flash of his hand and a squawk from the gull, he managed to \ngrab it and wring its neck.\u0014\nHe tore the feathers off, and he and his starving crew made a meal - \na very slight meal for eight men - of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they used the intestines for bait. With it, they caught fish, \nwhich gave them food and more bait.....\u0014\nand the cycle continued. With that simple survival technique, they \nwere able to endure the rigors of the sea until they were found and \nrescued (after 24 days at sea....)\u0014\n\u0014\n Eddie Rickenbacker lived many years beyond that ordeal, but he never \nforgot the sacrifice of that first lifesaving seagull. And he never \nstopped saying, \"Thank you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's why almost every Friday night he would walk to the end of the \npier with a bucket full of shrimp and a heart full of gratitude.\u0014\n\u0014\n (Max Lucado, In The Eye of the Storm, pp221, 225-226)\u0014\n PS: Eddie was also an Ace in WW I and started Eastern Airlines\u0014",

Yet few realize that she owed as much to the school \nof suffering and sorrow as to the academy where her powers were \ndeveloped. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer childhood was full of sadness. The woman with whom she lived \nlocked her in her room each day when she went to work; the only means \nthe child found of spending the long hours was to sit by the window \nand sing to herself. One day a music teacher in the city passing by \nheard the voice of the unseen singer and detected its possibilities. \nHe called a friend to his side, and together they listened to the \nwonderful voice within. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey got in touch with the child's guardian and made arrangements for \nthe almost friendless girl to be given her chance. There were many \ndifficulties to be overcome, but step by step she mounted the ladder \nof fame. She astounded London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, and New York. \nSome say there never was such a voice, trilling like the thrush, pure \nas the note of the lark. But those who knew her best realized how the \nsorrows of her childhood gave a richness and depth to her song that \notherwise would have been unattainable. She herself once wrote: In \nvain I seek for rest In all created good: It leaves me still unblest, \nAnd makes me cry for God. And safe at rest I cannot be Until my heart \nfinds rest in Thee.\u0014",

In all of the churches I have served as \npastor, only 6 percent of the members gave nearly two-thirds of all \nthe financial gifts of the church. I've served some wonderful \nchurches, but I've never served a church that wasn't being led by 6 \npercent of the members.

The metaphor originated with Southern \nBaptist preacher Carlyle Marney, who used the image of balcony. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarney used to say that your personhood, your personality, persona, \nis like a house, and it's a fairly elaborate and complex structure. \nSome are fancy. Some are sophisticated. Some are simple and \nfunctional. Some are ostentatious. Some are modest. Each has a number \nof rooms: a formal parlor for greeting guests, a family room, \nbedroom, kitchen. Marney said each of us has in the structure of our \npersona a basement where the plumbing is [located] and the trash is \nstored. NO need to spend your life down there, Marney used to say. \nEverybody has a basement. Come on up into the sunshine. Sometimes we \nact as if the plumbing and trash bin are all there is to us, Marney \nobserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if you come upstairs and step outside onto the lawn and look up, \nyou will see that the house that is you has a spacious, gracious \nbalcony. There are people up there on your balcony. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarney was a Southerner, so his balcony was white wrought iron with \nwicker rocking chairs. There are people in the rocking chairs on your \nbalcony sipping iced tea or bourbon, depending on whether you are a \nBaptist or Presbyterian, Marney used to say. The people on your \nbalcony are the strong, positive influences in your life. Your heroes \nand heroines. Your models and mentors. Your parents are probably up \nthere ... your grandparents. There are some folk up there you never \nmet but they influenced and helped shape you and there are some \nreally big names up there: people whose lives inspired you from afar \nand called deeper faith out of you and courage and stamina and love \nand discipline.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people on your balcony are your saints. The way to observe All \nSaints' Day is to walk out onto your lawn, look up and greet them. \nCall the roll. Name them. Wave to them. Your saints -- your dear ones \n-- the great ones and small ones: your mother and father maybe, \nDietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, your old coach, your piano \nteacher. \u0014\n\u0014\n--John M.

The numbers are part of a continuing and ominous \ntrend. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the rates are probably underestimates because they are based on a \nphone survey in which 400,000 participants were asked their weight \nand height instead of having it measured by someone else, and people \nhave a notorious tendency to describe themselves as taller and \nlighter than they really are. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past several decades, obesity has increased faster than \nanyone could have imagined it would, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the \ndirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which \nissued a report on the prevalence of obesity. Obesity rates have \ndoubled in adults and tripled in children in recent decades, Dr. \nFrieden said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the numbers keep going up, he added, more people will get sick \nand die from the complications of obesity, such as heart disease, \nstroke, diabetes and cancer. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report estimates the medical costs of obesity to be as high as \n$147 billion a year, and notes that past efforts and investments to \nprevent and control obesity have not been adequate. \u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers blame the usual suspects: too little exercise and too \nmuch of the wrong kind of food, which means not enough fruits and \nvegetables and too many high-calorie meals full of sugar and fat, \nlike French fries, soda and other sweet drinks. Children do not get \nenough exercise during the school day; Dr. Frieden noted that even in \ngym classes, students are active for only about a third of the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nA 5-foot-4-inch woman is obese if she weighs 174 pounds, as is a \n5-foot-10-inch man who weights 209 or more, according to the disease \ncenters. Both would have a body-mass index, or BMI, of 30; that index \nis calculated from height and weight, and scores of 30 or over are \ndefined as obese. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe nine states with obesity rates of 30 percent or more are Alabama, \nArkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, \nTennessee and West Virginia. The highest rate, 34.4 percent, was in \nMississippi. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople over 50 had higher rates of obesity than those who were \nyounger. The aging of the population may account for some of the \ngeneral increase in obesity, but not all of it, said Dr. Heidi \nBlanck, chief of the disease centers obesity branch of the division \nof nutrition, physical activity and obesity. \u0014\n\u0014\nNon-Hispanic black women had the highest obesity rate, 41.9 percent. \nOver all, blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to be \nobese, and the more education people had, the less likely they were \nto be heavy. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly Colorado and Washington, D.C., had obesity rates under 20 \npercent. Researchers are not sure why. Dr. William Dietz, director of \nthe nutrition, physical activity and obesity division, said that \nColorado had spent money from a state lottery on biking and walking \ntrails and that many people were using them. The state seems to have \na culture of physical activity, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Dietz said the relatively low prevalence of obesity in Washington \nwas harder to explain, particularly because the area has a large \nblack population.\u0014",

    "words": "October 21, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nOutsourcing Baby-Making in India\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disturbing realities of reproductive tourism as a global growth \nsector.\u0014\n\u0014\nEllen Painter Dollar\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a typical story in our global economy: Citizens of wealthy \nnations hire Indians to provide goods and services that cost less \nthan the same goods or services domestically produced. But in the \ncase of reproductive tourism, the Indian laborers are surrogate \nmothers who literally labor on behalf of foreign couples. They are \npaid to 'host' babies who are later carried home to the U.S., \nBritain, Israel, Australia, and other developed nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne expert recently referred to reproductive tourism as a global \ngrowth sector, with India leading the trend. (Reproductive tourism \nis not limited to India. British women regularly travel to U.S. \nfertility clinics to access a larger pool of donated eggs, and \nIndian-style surrogacy programs are springing up in Guatemala.) \nFertility clinics in India market their services by offering foreign \nclients travel services so they can sightsee while in India for an \nIVF cycle or retrieving their baby. The clinics also recruit \nsurrogates, usually poor Indian mothers; help clients obtain donor \neggs and sperm; perform in vitro fertilization (IVF); house, feed, \nand provide medical care to surrogates during their pregnancies; and \ndeliver babies. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdvocates for this business claim that everyone wins. Childless \ncouples get the babies they long for, and surrogates receive income \nfor better housing and education for their own children. But its not \nthat simple. Indian surrogates must live in special housing while \nthey are pregnant. They are well-fed and taken care of, but what does \nit say about whose families are more valuable when Indian mothers are \naway from their own children for months while they gestate babies for \nwealthier foreigners? According to a recent Slate article, many of \nthe women cannot read their surrogacy contracts. Those from higher \ncastes are paid more than those from lower castes, and surrogates are \npaid only if they deliver a living child.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo scenes from the HBO documentary Google Baby illustrate the \ninjustice and heartbreak in the fertility tourism boom. In one scene, \nan Indian woman who recently gave birth to a baby for a foreign \ncouple sits by her husband as he talks about the difference their \nsurrogate payment has made, allowing them to buy a house and other \ncomforts. He says he expects his wife will serve as a surrogate \nagain. He says that, although womens brains are generally inferior \nto mens, his wife made a good decision. The wife, who admitted in an \nearlier scene that handing the baby over right after birth was very \npainful, listens in silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another scene, an Indian woman is on the operating table, giving \nbirth via C-section. She says she can feel the doctor cutting, and it \nbecomes clear that her anesthesia is not working. The \nanesthesiologist puts something into her IV line and soon, she is \nlying still, sedated. One doctor standing by her head pushes hard on \nher belly over and over, as if he is kneading a stubborn loaf of \nbread. Another doctor pulls the baby out. Immediately after \ndelivering the baby, the doctor answers a phone call while a staff \nperson wraps the baby and takes her away. The babys intended parents \nwill not arrive in India to pick her up for several days, so in the \nmeantime, the staffer will care for the infant. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe surrogate lies on a stretcher, her eyes dazed and vacant as her \nhusband holds her hand and strokes her hair. A baby was just born, an \nevent that usually brings people together. But all of the parties \ninvolved are essentially alone, disconnected from each other and from \nthe central event of the babys birth: The doctor takes a phone call, \nthe surrogate woozily recovers from sedation, the intended parents \nmake travel plans, and the baby is whisked away.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn researching reproductive ethics, I come across those who scoff at \nthe possibility of designer babies in which children are \nmanufactured to meet cultural expectations. Many insist that such \nfears are overblown, because the public would never accept such \nviolations of human dignity. Certainly most fertility patients set \nout to build a loving family, not exploit poor women or manufacture a \nchild to their specifications.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as reproductive technology grows in scope and capability, it \nraises significant moral questions that deserve our attention (as I \nwrote about IVF two weeks ago). Fertility tourism might be one area \nof reproductive ethics where conservative Christians, who \ntraditionally focus on the sanctity of human life, and liberal \nChristians, who traditionally focus on human rights, particularly for \nwomen, can speak out together for justice and compassion. We don't \nhave to project some dystopian future to witness instances in which \nhuman dignity  the dignity of Indian mothers serving as surrogates \nand the babies they deliver  is violated by clinics, entrepreneurs, \nand aspiring parents who are turning procreation into a \nfee-for-service market.\u0014",

    "words": "November 24, 1531 \u0014\n\u0014\nOeceolampadius, the \"House Light\" \u0014\n\u0014\nToday most Protestant churches, at least in the western world, take \nfor granted that those who attend a church should have some say in \nhow it is run. That hasn't always been so. Even when the Protestant \nReformation began in the sixteenth century, Luther and other \nreformers thought that the church ought to be directed primarily by \nthe clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first person to suggest otherwise was a little known reformer \ncalled Oecolampadius. (His real name was Hussgen. But in those days \nit was popular to change one's name into a classical language. \n\"Hussgen\" sounds like the German for house-shine, so he became \"house \nlamp\" in Greek.) Oecolampadius's suggestion that laymen be allowed a \nsay in church affairs was shot down when he proposed it to the town \ncouncil of Basle, Switzerland. However, other reformers, such as John \nCalvin and John Knox agreed with him, and so an important element of \nreligious freedom was brought into the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nOecolampadius was a top-notch student of languages. The \nground-breaking linguists of the day were Reuchlin and Erasmus. \nOecolampadius studied with both. He even helped Erasmus edit and \npublish the New Testament in Greek which had such a profound effect \non the rise of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne way a scholar could earn a little extra money in those days was \nto translate Greek books for the recently invented and hungry \nprinting press. Oecolampadius translated writings of the Greek \nfathers. After the Reformation got rolling, he sided with the \nreformers. Despite weak health, he labored hard for reform in \nSwitzerland.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1516, a year before Luther posted his famous theses, Ulrich \nZwingli spearheaded a reformation movement in Zurich. He was still a \nRoman Catholic, but insisted on teaching through the Bible. Around \n1523, Oecolampadius began a friendship with Zwingli and drifted away \nfrom the more conservative and timid Erasmus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis relationship with Zwingli is often compared to the relationship \nof Melanchthon with Luther. A peaceful man, Oecolampadius was \ntolerant of differences in the Protestant beliefs about the Lord's \nSupper. He also rebuked harsher reformers for their abrasive \nbehavior. He wrote to William Farel, \"Your mission is to evangelize, \nnot to curse. Prove yourself to be an evangelist, not a tyrannical \nlegislator. Men want to be led, not driven.\" Reformation should be \norderly, said Oecolampadius.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe worked so hard in spite of his bad health, that when he died on \nthis day, November 24, 1531, he was only 49. A little-known light of \nthe Reformation was extinguished.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nLauchert, Friedrich. \"Oecolampadius, John.\" The Catholic \nEncyclopedia.

Both faced gut-wrenching realities \nthat sometimes cause law-abiding individuals to blur the lines \nbetween whats legal and what seems morally permissible. The shades \nof gray present both an interesting dilemma and a significant \nopportunity for Christians concerned about legal and educational \njustice in the U.S.. \u0014\n\u0014\nLes Misrables is a familiar tale. Set in 19th-century France, the \nstory's protagonist, Jean Valjean, is arrested for stealing a loaf of \nbread in order to feed his sisters seven destitute children. Valjean \nspends several years in prison for his crime. After his eventual \nrelease, the plot takes us through a complex story rooted in themes \nof social inequity, justice, mercy and fairness. We are caused to \nwrestle with whether or not Valjeans original sentence was just. \nAfter all, Valjean was simply trying to take care of his sisters \nstarving children. The kids had no other apparent options and \npresumably would have starved to death. Should we grant leniency to \nJean Valjean, given the circumstances? \u0014\n\u0014\nLets consider the modern-day story of Kelley Williams-Bolar, a \nsingle mom in Akron, Ohio. Williams-Bolar has three children, and \nshes raising them in Akrons public housing projects. Like most \ninner cities, in Akron quality schools are sparse, and the local \nneighborhood public schools are among the worst in the area. \nAccording to 2008-09 state data, only 48 percent of African American \nstudents scored at or above proficient in reading, and only 39 \npercent scored similarly in math. \u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing the life-changing importance of a good education, \nWilliams-Bolar made a decision to send her children to live with \ntheir grandfather in nearby Copley-Fairlawn School District. Her \nchildren were never official residents of Copley-Fairlawn, so Kelley \nwas breaking the law by using her fathers address to send the \nchildren to Copley-Fairlawn. Last month, she was convicted on two \nfelony charges for falsifying records and sentenced to 10 days in \njail, 3 years of probation, and 80 hours of community service. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdding to the tragic irony, Williams-Bolar is an assistant \nspecial-education teacher at an Akron school district high school and \na student at the University of Akron, where shes one semester away \nfrom receiving her bachelors degree and teaching certificate. Now \nthat she has a felony conviction on her record the presiding Judge \nPatricia Cosgrove informed her, You will not be allowed to get your \nteaching degree under Ohio law as it stands today. This mom was \ntrying to do the right thing. She was working hard, balancing life as \na struggling single mother, to get her college degree so she would \nhave the means to move her children to a neighborhood with better \neducational opportunities. Now it appears that her efforts will have \nbeen in vain. Kelley, her children, and the students she would have \nserved as a teacher will be penalized. \u0014\n\u0014\nI've found that I can split the online reactions to this story into \ntwo camps. There are those who feel absolutely that this mom was in \nthe wrong and got what she deserved. On the flip side, the vast \nmajority of others seem to feel that she was justified and shouldnt \nbe punished. I find degrees of truth in both arguments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to school enrollment restrictions, this mother certainly \ndid break the law. But ultimately I believe that an either-or \nperspective on Williams-Bolar misses a deeper and more significant \nopportunity for reflection and societal change. I believe we should \nbe asking ourselves a key question: Why do we create systems that \nforce people to make dire ethical choices about basic human needs \nsuch food or a decent education? As a Christian, I believe God wants \nus to look at adverse and unjust situations in our society  such as \neducational inequity  and realize that we have the opportunity to \ntruly make a positive impact. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy husband and I are fortunate to have wonderful, high-quality school \noptions for our three children. We will likely never face the ethical \nchoice Williams-Bolar had to make. But under parallel circumstances, \nwould I make the same decision she did? Would I feel pressured to \nensure my children got the best education possible, even if it meant \nbending the rules to do it? Honestly, Im not sure. Williams-Bolar \nknows what we all know: The best way to ensure our children have an \nequal chance in life is by providing them with a quality education. \nShe was willing to take a risk to make that happen. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians, instead of passing judgment on Williams-Bolar and \nother moms in similar situations, we should focus our efforts on \nunderstanding why our nations unequal public school system drives \nsome parents to break the law to ensure their kids get a good \neducation. And, more importantly, what can we do to help change our \ncountrys overall public education system so parents wont have to \nface such dire choices?\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are a few suggestions of what people of faith can do to help end \neducational inequity: \u0014\n Serve as a tutor or mentor at-risk students.\u0014\n Support a school board candidate, or add your name to the ballot.\u0014\n Encourage exceptional young people you know to become teachers, \nperhaps by joining Teach For America.\u0014\n Sponsor an under-resourced school in your area serving high-poverty \nstudents.\u0014\n Pray for Gods guidance for our teachers and schools leaders.\u0014\nNicole Baker Fulgham is vice president of faith community relations \nfor Teach for America.\u0014",

    "title": "ONE CONSTITUTION--TWO POINTS OF VIEW",
    "words": "One Constitution  Two Points of View \u0014\nColin Harris,    January 31, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe opening act of the 112th Congress' political theater was a \nselective reading of the United States Constitution, a dramatic \ndemonstration of allegiance to the nation's foundational document. \nResponses varied from affirmations of the exercise to suspicions it \nwas an empty gesture. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's hard to find anyone who denies the value of the Constitution as \nthe cornerstone of our government, but there may be value in some \ncareful thinking about how we understand the nature and application \nof this expression of our national covenant.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorking recently with a class on the context of the New Testament, we \nexamined the Judaism of the period. We noted the central allegiance \nof the Jewish people to the Torah as the guiding formulation of their \ncovenant relationship with God. We noted also that two of the parties \nof Jewish leaders had very different understandings of how the Torah \nwas to be regarded, interpreted and applied.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sadducees were an aristocratic, socially and economically \nprivileged group, who enjoyed both priestly religious authority and a \nclose association with the Herodian political dynasty. Their \nadherence to the Torah was characterized by a strict reading of the \nlaw and a rigid application of its rules. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey did not ascribe authority to any subsequent interpretation that \nmodified its strict rules or made application to issues outside its \nliteral boundaries. The high priest Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin would \nbe familiar representatives of this party in the gospel story.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pharisees, by contrast, were a group identified not by their \neconomic, social and political standing but by their commitment to \npreserve, teach, interpret and apply the principles of the Torah to \nthe ever-changing circumstances of the Jewish people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey understood the Torah to be their core covenant faith document, \nbut they also believed it invited and required an ongoing \ninterpretation and application. They tended to be more lenient in \napplying the penal rules (that is, stoning) and more flexible with \nthe ritual rules.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the best known Pharisee in the New Testament, Paul, \nportrays a strong passion for truth combined with the courage to \nchange in response to new understanding. We remember also the \ninquiring Nicodemus of John 3 and the peacemaker Gamaliel of Acts \n5:34ff, as well as those of this party who dined frequently with \nJesus (Luke 7:36ff and 14:1) and warned him of the plot against him \n(Luke 13:31).\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo perspectives toward the Torah: one held by a priestly class who \nwanted to apply it \"just as it was\" in ways that conveniently \nsupported their privileged place in society; the other held by a \nfellowship of rabbis who regarded it as a \"living\" law whose spirit \nmore than letter would continue to guide the covenant community into \na future of new challenges for peace and justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was hard not to connect these ancient perspectives with the \ncurrent debates about the nature of the Constitution. \"Originalists,\" \nwhose current standard bearer is Supreme Court Justice Antonin \nScalia, argue that the Constitution \"says what it says and means what \nit means\" and does not permit \u0014\n\"revisionist\" interpretations to respond to current winds of doctrine \nor contemporary issues. Others, who see it as a \"living\" document, \nsee it as inviting, even requiring, interpretation and application to \nchallenges unanticipated by its original writers.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, the Torah and the Constitution are not the same thing; but \nthey both function as foundational formulations for covenant \ncommunities that embrace some common principles for life and that \nmove through history with a similar vision. The authority they embody \nand the guidance they provide will vary according to which \nperspective is more operative in the community's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nHuman perspectives seem to stay the same; only the names and issues \nchange.\u0014\nWill our way of being \"constitutional\" be the way of Caiaphas and the \nSanhedrin (\"He's disrespecting the Temple and pushing for change! \nAway with him!\"), or that of the prophets (\"I will put my Law within \nthem, and write it upon their hearts ....\"  Jeremiah 31:33) and \nJesus (\"You have heard it said ... but I say unto you....\"  Matthew \n5)?\u0014\n\u0014\nWill the Constitution protect a status quo we find beneficial or \npoint toward a future in which we apply its principles in ways its \n\"originators\" did not envision?\u0014\n\u0014\nColin Harris is professor of religious studies at Mercer University \nand a member of Smoke Rise Baptist Church in Stone Mountain, Ga.\u0014",

    "title": "OLD BISHOP POLYCARP",
    "words": "February 23, 155 \u0014\nOld Bishop Polycarp\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nTowards the end of the first century, or perhaps even at the \nbeginning of the second century A.D., the apostle John died after \nyears of ministry to the churches of Asia Minor, the region now \noccupied by modern Turkey. John was the last of the original \napostles, but the truths of Christianity did not die with him. His \nspiritual children continued to stand firm in the faith in Christ as \nthe Son of God that John had heard, seen, and even touched (as John \ntells us in 1 John 1:1-2).\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of John's spiritual sons, Polycarp, was born about 69 A.D. He \nlived in Smyrna and learned much by listening to John. Polycarp \nbecame a leader of the church at Smyrna, and in many ways his \ncharacter reflected that of his teacher. He had the same noble \nChristian spirit, full of gentleness, yet inflexible in speaking out \nagainst error.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church at Smyrna, of which Polycarp was the bishop, was one of \nthose addressed by Christ in the Revelation. Christ told them that \npersecution was about to come upon them and promised a crown of life \nto those who were faithful unto death. The promise was undoubtedly \nrepeated by Polycarp to many in his flock to encourage them as the \nRomans hauled them off to face wild beasts or death by fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the authorities searched for Polycarp, friends persuaded him to \nleave the city and hide in a farm-house. There he spent his time in \nprayer. A letter written by the Church of Smyrna told that: \"while \npraying he fell into a trance three days before his capture; and he \nsaw his pillow burning with fire. And he turned and said to those \nthat were with him, 'it must be that I shall be burned alive'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When his pursuers were on his track he went to another farm-house. \nFinding him gone they put two slave boys to the torture, and one of \nthem betrayed his place of concealment. Herod, head of the police, \nsent a body of men to arrest him on Friday evening. Escape was still \npossible, but the old man refused to flee, saying, \"the will of God \nbe done\". He came down to meet his pursuers, conversed affably with \nthem, and ordered food to be set before them. While they were eating \nhe prayed, 'remembering all, high and low, who at any time had come \nin his way, and the Catholic Church throughout the world.' Then he \nwas led away.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proconsul (an important magistrate) ordered Polycarp to renounce \nChrist and give obedience to Caesar as Lord. Polycarp answered: \n\"Eighty and six years have I served Christ, nor has He ever done me \nany harm. How, then, could I blaspheme my King who saved me? You \nthreaten the fire that burns for an hour and then is quenched; but \nyou know not of the fire of the judgment to come, and the fire of \neternal punishment. Bring what you will.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPolycarp, the last one of those personally taught by the apostles, \nwas burned at the stake on this day, February 23, 155. As the Lord \nrequired, Polycarp was faithful unto death; he did so in expectation \nthat he would receive a crown of life from Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Story. \u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "ONCE RARE IN RURAL AMERICA, DIVORCE IS CHANGING FAMILIES",
    "words": "Once Rare in Rural America, Divorce Is \nChanging the Face of Its Families\u0014\n\n                                                                            \nMarch 23, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nBy SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT GEBELOFF\u0014\n\u0014\nSIOUX COUNTY, Iowa  In the 1970s, the divorce rate was so low in \nthis rural northwest Iowa County that it resembled the rest of \nAmerica in the 1910s. Most of its 28,000 residents were churchgoers, \nfew of its women were in the work force, and divorce was simply not \ndone. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo it is a bitter mark of modernity that even here, divorce has swept \nin, up nearly sevenfold since 1970, giving the county the unwelcome \ndistinction of being a standout in this category of census data. \u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is still less common here than the national average, but its \nsharp jump illustrates a fundamental change in the patterns of family \nlife. \u0014\n\u0014\nForty years ago, divorced people were more concentrated in cities and \nsuburbs. But geographic distinctions have all but vanished, and now, \nfor the first time, rural Americans are just as likely to be divorced \nas city dwellers, according to an analysis of census data by The New \nYork Times. \u0014\nRural families are going through this incredible transformation, \nsaid Daniel T. Lichter, a sociology professor at Cornell University. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe shifts that started in cities have spread to less populated \nregions  women going to work, gaining autonomy, and re-arranging the \norder of traditional families. Values have changed, too, easing the \nstigma of divorce. \u0014\nIn the bottom ranks, men have lost ground and women have gained, \nsaid June Carbone, a law professor at the University of \nMissouri-Kansas City and co-author of Red Families v. Blue \nFamilies. \u0014\n\u0014\nA blue-collar guy has less to offer today than he did in 1979, \nProfessor Carbone added. Those shifting forces, she said, create a \nmismatch between expectation and reality that can result in women \nbecoming frustrated and leaving, because now they can. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince 1990, class has become an increasingly reliable predictor of \nfamily patterns, Professor Carbone said. College-educated Americans \nare now more likely to get married and stay married than those with \nonly a high school diploma, a change from 20 years ago, she said, \nwhen differences were much smaller. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat trend has been particularly important for rural areas, which \nhave fallen further behind urban ones in education, according to \ncensus data. Just one in six rural residents have college degrees, \nfar fewer than in cities, where one in three do. Nationally, there \nwere about 121 million married adults and 26 million divorced people \nin 2009, compared with about 100 million married and 11 million \ndivorced people in 1980. \u0014\n\u0014\nEducation drew a dividing line for Nancy Vermeer, a 52-year-old \nresident of Sioux County. She had married her high school sweetheart, \na young man from a farming family. He never went further than high \nschool, but she went on to college, and later earned a masters \ndegree. He worked in a window factory. She became a music teacher. He \ngambled. They grew apart. Eventually, he asked for a divorce. \u0014\n\u0014\nI grew more confident, Ms. Vermeer said. We were totally different \npeople. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ms. Vermeer divorced in 2002, she became the first teacher in \nher Christian school to do so. Divorce was more common than it had \nbeen in past decades, but she still felt judged, so she developed \nhabits to keep a low profile, like going to the grocery when no one \nshe knew would be there. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres a perception here that you need to be perfect, said the \nRev. John Lee, a young pastor who has tried to encourage change in \nSioux County by taking on taboo topics like divorce and mental \nillness in his sermons. \u0014\n\u0014\nCars are washed, lawns are mowed in patterns and children are \nsmiling, Mr. Lee added. When you admit weakness, you invite shame. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason can be traced to Sioux Countys roots. About 80 percent of \nresidents, most of whom are descendants of Dutch immigrants, belong \nto a major denomination church, compared with 36 percent of all \nAmericans. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts main city, Sioux Center, issued its first liquor license in the \nlate 1970s. Stores were closed on Sundays for decades, and womens \nparticipation in the work force was far below the national average. \u0014\n\u0014\nVery few people divorced. In 1980, there were more than 52 married \npeople for every divorced person, according to census data, a rate \nnot seen on a national level since the 1930s. \u0014\n\u0014\nCraig Lane, a divorce lawyer from the area, described the countys \nconservative nature like this: If steam is coming from your dryer \nvent on Sunday, youll hear about it from your neighbor. \u0014\n\u0014\nTime has worn away some of its old values. These days, Sioux Center \nlooks more like a suburb than a village. There is a McDonalds and a \nmall, where residents shop to the sound of Christian music. Womens \nlives have changed too. More women than men have college degrees, and \nthere are now just 14 married people to every divorced person. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs we get more education we get more confidence and more income, \nMs. Vermeer said, women are saying, Look, she finally had the guts \nto stand up and walk out.  \u0014\n\u0014\nSioux Center might be rural, but it is relatively affluent, buoyed by \na biotech industry and a stable manufacturing base. Its Christian \ncollege, Dordt, is a major presence. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut for less fortunate places, social change is laced with a bitter \nnew economic reality. Brian Janssen, the pastor at the church in \nHospers, east of Sioux Center, speaks wistfully about an earlier \ntime, when families were closer and more tied to the land. Now, he \ncan count on one hand the number of young people from his church who \nhave stayed in town. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe community begins to become like senior housing, Mr. Janssen \nsaid. Dialysis center, old person living. \u0014\n\u0014\nLess educated Americans are far more likely to have babies while \nunmarried  and to divorce  than those with college degrees, \nProfessor Carbone said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat trend, once seen as a symptom of urban poverty, has now caught \non in rural areas like this one. Leesa McNeil, a court administrator \nfor a district that covers a wide area of northwest Iowa, said that \ncustody cases involving unmarried people used to be so rare that the \ncourt did not even have a category for them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat was a phenomenon that smacked us 10 years ago, Ms. McNeil \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaria Kefalas, a sociology professor at St. Josephs University in \nPhiladelphia and co-author of Hollowing Out the Middle, a 2009 book \nabout the migration of the educated class from rural Iowa, said that \nchanges in families have been profound. She noted that the alarm \nsounded by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1965 about the rise of \nout-of-wedlock births among African-Americans applies to the country \nas a whole today: One in three babies is born to unmarried parents. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt has hit the whitest, most married, most idyllic heart of America \n Iowa, Professor Kefalas said. The cultural narrative about \nmarriage  you get a job, you marry your sweetheart, you buy a house, \nyou educate your kids  has been torn to shreds. Without that \neconomic foundation, the story cannot support itself. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Sioux County, Ms. Vermeer has remarried. She is happy, she said, \nand her life makes sense. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think women were very miserable for very many years, and thats \nchanging, she said. Things are not so black and white. There are so \nmany gray areas. \u0014\n\u0014\nSabrina Tavernise reported from Sioux Center, and Robert Gebeloff \nfrom New York.\u0014",

    "words": "\"Our Lives, Our \nFortunes, Our Sacred Honor\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a glorious morning. The sun was shining and the wind was from \nthe southeast. Up especially early, a tall bony, redheaded young \nVirginian found time to buy a new thermometer, for which he paid \nthree pounds, fifteen shillings. He also bought gloves for Martha, \nhis wife, who was ill at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jefferson arrived early at the statehouse. The temperature was \n72.5 degrees and the horseflies weren't nearly so bad at that hour. \nIt was a lovely room, very large, with gleaming white walls. The \nchairs were comfortable. Facing the single door were two brass \nfireplaces, but they would not be used today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe moment the door was shut, and it was always kept locked, the room \nbecame an oven. The tall windows were shut, so that loud quarreling \nvoices could not be heard by passersby. Small openings atop the \nwindows allowed a slight stir of air, and also a large number of \nhorseflies. Jefferson records that \"the horseflies were dexterous in \nfinding necks, and the silk of stockings was nothing to them.\" All \ndiscussing was punctuated by the slap of hands on necks.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the wall at the back, facing the president's desk, was a panoply \n-- consisting of a drum, swords, and banners seized from Fort \nTiconderoga the previous year. Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold had \ncaptured the place, shouting that they were taking it \"in the name of \nthe Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow Congress got to work, promptly taking up an emergency measure \nabout which there was discussion but no dissension. \"Resolved: That \nan application be made to the Committee of Safety of Pennsylvania for \na supply of flints for the troops at New York.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Congress transformed itself into a committee of the whole. The \nDeclaration of Independence was read aloud once more, and debate \nresumed. Though Jefferson was the best writer of all of them, he had \nbeen somewhat verbose. Congress hacked the excess away. They did a \ngood job, as a side-by-side comparison of the rough draft and the \nfinal text shows. They cut the phrase \"by a self-assumed power.\" \n\"Climb\" was replaced by \"must read,\" then \"must\" was eliminated, then \nthe whole sentence, and soon the whole paragraph was cut. Jefferson \ngroaned as they continued what he later called \"their depredations.\" \n\"Inherent and inalienable rights\" came out \"certain unalienable \nrights,\" and to this day no one knows who suggested the elegant \nchange.\u0014\n\u0014\nA total of 86 alterations were made. Almost 500 words were \neliminated, leaving 1,337. At last, after three days of wrangling, \nthe document was put to a vote.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere in this hall Patrick Henry had once thundered: \"I am no longer a \nVirginian, sir, but an American.\" But today the loud, sometimes \nbitter argument stilled, and without fanfare the vote was taken from \nnorth to south by colonies, as was the custom. On July 4, 1776, the \nDeclaration of Independence was adopted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were no trumpets blown. No one stood on his chair and cheered. \nThe afternoon was waning and Congress had no thought of delaying the \nfull calendar of routine business on its hands. For several hours \nthey worked on many other problems before adjourning for the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My documents/ Our Lives, Our Fortunes, Our \nSacred Honor\u0014",

    "title": "ORIGINS OF WORDS AND PHRASES",
    "words": "\u0014\n 1..Q: Whyare many coin banks shaped like pigs?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: Long ago, dishes and cookware inEuropewere made of a dense\u0014\nOrange clay called 'pygg'. When people saved coins in jars made of\u0014\nThis clay, the jars became known as 'pygg banks.' When an English\u0014\nPotter misunderstood the word, he made a bank that resembled a pig.\u0014\nAnd it caught on.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Q: Did you ever wonder why dimes, quarters and half dollars \nhavenotches, while pennies and nickels do not?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: TheUS Mintbegan putting notches on the edges of coins\u0014\nContaining gold and silver to discourage holders from shaving off\u0014\nSmall quantities of the precious metals. Dimes, quarters and half\u0014\nDollars are notched because they used to contain silver. Pennies and\u0014\nNickels aren't notched because the metals they contain are not\u0014\nValuable enough to shave.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Q: Why do men's clothes have buttons on the right while \nwomen'sclothes have buttons on the left?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: When buttons were invented, they were very expensive and worn\u0014\nPrimarily by the rich. Because wealthy women were dressed by maids,\u0014\nDressmakers put the buttons on the maid's right.! Since most people\u0014\nAre right-handed, it is easier to push buttons on the right through\u0014\nHoles on the left. And that's where women's buttons have remained\u0014\nSince.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Q. Why do X's at the end of a letter signify kisses?\u0014\nA: In the Middle Ages, when many people were unable to read or\u0014\nWrite, documents were often signed using an X. Kissing the X\u0014\nRepresented an oath to fulfill obligations specified in the\u0014\nDocument. The X and the kiss eventually became synonymous.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Q: Why is shifting responsibility to someone else called'passing \nthe buck'?\u0014\nA: In card games, it was once customary to pass an item, called a\u0014\nBuck, from player to player to indicate whose turn it was to deal.\u0014\nIf a player did not wish to assume the responsibility, he would\u0014\n'pass the buck' to the next player.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?\u0014\nA: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by\u0014\nOffering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was\u0014\nSafe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his\u0014\nDrink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it\u0014\nSimultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just\u0014\nTouch or clink the host's glass with his own.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Q: Why are people in the public eye said to be 'in the limelight'?\u0014\nA: Invented in 1825, limelight was used in lighthouses and stage\u0014\nLighting by burning a cylinder of lime which produced a brilliant\u0014\nLight. In the theatre, performers on stage 'in the limelight' were\u0014\nSeen by the audience to be the center of attention.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Q: Why do ships and aircraft in trouble use 'mayday' as theircall \nfor help?\u0014\nA: This comes from the French word m'aidez - meaning 'help me' --\u0014\nAnd is pronounced 'mayday.'\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Q: Why is someone who is feeling great 'on cloud nine'?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: Types of clouds are numbered according to the altitudes they\u0014\nAttain, with nine being the highest cloud. If someone is said to be\u0014\nOn cloud nine, that person is floating well above worldly cares.\u0014\n\u0014\n10.. Q: Why are zero scores in tennis called 'love'?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: InFrance, where tennis first became popular, a big, round zero\u0014\nOn the scoreboard looked like an egg and was called 'l'oeuf,' which\u0014\nIs French for 'egg.' When tennis was introduced in the US,\u0014\nAmericans pronounced it 'love.'\u0014\n\u0014\n11.. Q: In golf, where did the term 'Caddie' come from?\u0014\n\u0014\nA.. When Mary, later Queen of Scots, went to France as a young girl\u0014\n(for education & survival), Louis, King of France , learned that she\u0014\nLoved the Scot game 'golf.' So he had the first golf course outside\u0014\nOfScotlandbuilt for her enjoyment. To make sure she was properly\u0014\nChaperoned (and guarded) while she played, Louis hired cadets from a\u0014\nMilitary school to accompany her. Mary liked this a lot and when she\u0014\nReturned to Scotland (not a very good idea in the long run), she\u0014\nTook the practice with her. In French, the word cadet is pronounced\u0014\n'ca-day' and the Scots changed it into 'caddie.'\u0014\n\u0014\nNow YOU know just about everything\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWidth2Width5000Width2Width5000\u0014\nWidth2Width5000Width2Width5000\u0014",

    "words": "Origin of the Hymn: \"Jesus Paid \nit All\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"How long Pastor's prayer is this morning,\" thought Elvina Hall.\u0014\n\u0014\nSitting in the choir loft, Elvina's mind turned to our need for \nsalvation and the price Jesus paid for it. Words began to form \nthemselves. She had to get them down. But she had no paper. Well, \nthat wasn't quite true...\u0014\n\u0014\nScribbling on the flyleaf of her hymnbook, she wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nI hear the Savior say,\u0014\n\"Thy strength indeed is small;\u0014\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\u0014\nFind in Me thine all in all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus paid it all,\u0014\nAll to Him I owe;\u0014\nSin had left a crimson stain,\u0014\nHe washed it white as snow.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot bad. Not bad at all. After service, she handed the words to her \npastor. Did his face crease into a little smile at this evidence of \nher \"naughty\" behavior? We may never know.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut we do know that an extraordinary \"coincidence\" took place that \nday at the Monument Street Methodist Church of Baltimore. Organist \nJohn Grape had recently written a new tune and given it to the \npastor. The pastor saw that the tune and the poem fit together \nextremely well. So he united them. In that way, one of the most \nbeloved hymns of the church came into being.\u0014\n\u0014\nLyrics of \"Jesus Paid It All\"\u0014\nI hear the Savior say,\u0014\nThy strength indeed is small;\u0014\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\u0014\nFind in Me thine all in all. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRefrain:\u0014\nJesus paid it all,\u0014\nAll to Him I owe;\u0014\nSin had left a crimson stain,\u0014\nHe washed it white as snow.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor nothing good have I\u0014\nWhereby Thy grace to claim;\u0014\nIll wash my garments white\u0014\nIn the blood of Calvrys Lamb.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now complete in Him,\u0014\nMy robe, His righteousness,\u0014\nClose sheltered neath His side,\u0014\nI am divinely blest.\u0014\n\u0014\nLord, now indeed I find\u0014\nThy powr, and Thine alone,\u0014\nCan change the *lepers spots [*leopards]\u0014\nAnd melt the heart of stone.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen from my dying bed\u0014\nMy ransomed soul shall rise,\u0014\nJesus died my soul to save,\u0014\nShall rend the vaulted skies.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd when before the throne\u0014\nI stand in Him complete,\u0014\nIll lay my trophies down,\u0014\nAll down at Jesus feet.\u0014\n\u0014\nElvina Hall was 45 at that time.

    "title": "O WORSHIP THE KING",
    "words": "Sir Robert Grant Penned \"O Worship the King\"\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nSir Robert Grant was a busy man of the world--too busy to concern \nhimself with hymns, you might think. He had been born in India in \n1779, the son of the East India Company's director, Charles Grant, a \nman associated with the Clapham Sect (a group of evangelical social \nreformers from Clapham, England).\u0014\nBorn in the colonies Robert may have been, but it was in Magdalen \nCollege at the University of Oxford that he completed his higher \neducation. He was admitted to the bar in 1807--which meant he could \npractice law. The following year, the 29-year-old won a seat in \nParliament.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe remained in Parliament for many years. Like his father, he was \ndeeply concerned with social issues. Through his persistent efforts a \nbill was eventually passed which emancipated England's Jews. He \nfought for other minority groups, too. In the meantime, he was a \nstrong supporter of world missions and influential among evangelicals \nin the Church of England. He sketched a history of the East India \nCompany. Yet somehow, he found time to write hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, he wrote a hymn which is considered one of the greatest in \nthe English language. Reading William Kethe's translation of Psalm \n104 in a 1561 psalm book prompted Robert to write his own version of \nthe psalm, familiar to millions of church-goers.\u0014\n\u0014\nO Worship the King all glorious above! \u0014\nO gratefully sing his power and his love,\u0014\nOur Shield and Defender, the Ancient of days,\u0014\nPavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert accepted a high position in the East India company. One thing \nled to another. He was asked to be governor of Bombay and accepted. \nHe took over his new duties in 1834. As governor, he had opportunity \nto put his social concerns into practice, for the poverty and \nspiritual condition of the common people were appalling. Among his \naccomplishments were the opening of several new roads, an inducement \nto commerce.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe held the governorship only four years, dying on this day, July 9, \n1838 at the young age of 59. In that time, the people came to love \nhim. When Sir Jamshedji a well-known Parsi (a person of the \nZoroastrian faith), built a medical college, he gave it Robert \nGrant's name. It is the second oldest medical college in India.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Robert's death in 1838, his brother Charles printed \nSir Robert's twelve hymns in a slender volume called Sacred Poems. \nThe only one which is still sung by many people is \"O Worship the \nKing.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah.

    "title": "OSWALD, A BATTLE MARTYR",
    "words": "Oswald a Battle Martyr\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nThe life of a King in most former ages was troubled and short. When \nOswald's father, king of Northumbria, was killed by enemies, \neleven-year-old Oswald fled to Scotland. There he took refuge with \nColumba's monks on the isle of Iona. The monks led him to Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 633 King Edwin of Northumbria perished in battle against Penda and \nCadwallon. Oswald, who was either his nephew or brother, succeeded \nhim to the throne. Cadwallon ravaged Northumbria and so Oswald \nmarched against him. In Oswald's tiny force, few knew Christ or \nwanted to. On the eve of battle Oswald boldly set up a cross, holding \nit upright while dirt was packed into the hole dug for it. He then \ncried out, \"Let us now kneel down and together pray to the almighty \nand only true God that he will mercifully defend us from our enemy; \nfor He knows that we fight in defense of our lives and country.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat night while Oswald rested, Columba of Iona appeared to him in a \nvision, assuring him that he would have victory. Although enemy \nnumbers were far greater than his own, Oswald won. The upshot was his \npeople became willing to follow Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nOswald restored order throughout Northumbria and brought missionaries \nfrom Scotland to teach his people. Chief among these was Aiden. \nOswald himself offered to be Aiden's translator so that his people \nmight hear and understand the gospel. Thousands became Christians. \nThe isle of Lindisfarne was given Aiden for a Bishop's seat and a \nfamous monastery grew up there. Churches sprang up all across \nNorthumbria. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe King was famous for his prayerful spirit. So often did he praise \nGod and lift petitions to him that even at meals he kept his hands in \nan attitude of prayer. In the few short years that he reigned, \nOswald's kingdom gained such preeminence that all the other kings of \nEngland were subject to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOswald's charity was great, but one instance particularly stands out \nbecause of subsequent events. Once he gave a silver dish with its \ncontents of meat to the poor who clamored at his gate. Aidan blessed \nhis hand for the deed, exclaiming, \"May this hand never perish.\" \nOddly it was preserved after Oswald's death and was seen in good \ncondition 500 years later. The cross he erected was said to heal many \nwho soaked little pieces of it in water and swallowed them for \nhealing.

    "words": "Original Mayflower Compact\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nThere are more than l60 independent nations in the world. Whether \ndictatorships or democracies, nearly all have written constitutions, \nbut that of the United States is by far the oldest. This is something \nwe can too easily take for granted, but it really marked a pivotal \nturning point in history and the way nations came to govern \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you suppose the founding fathers ever thought of having a \nwritten Constitution? The idea of a written contract between the \npeople and their government came from a tiny band of 50 Christians \ncalled Pilgrims that sailed to America in the Mayflower in l620. The \nPilgrims believed many of the Church of England's traditions were not \nBiblical. Since both King James and the state church persecuted many \ncritics as criminals, the Pilgrims became Separatists and fled first \nto Holland, then to America. They planned to land in Virginia, where \nthey had a charter from the King to govern them, but Atlantic storms \ncarried them far north to Cape Cod. Since their charter was not valid \nin that region, they needed a new government.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so on this day, November 21, l620, the Pilgrims drew up and \nsigned the Mayflower Compact (which is actually dated the 11th of \nNovember because Britain was still using the Julian calendar) . It \nsaid: \"For the glorie of God and advancement of ye Christian faith, \nwe do... ...covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body \npolitick...to enact,... and frame... just and equal laws...for the \ngeneral good of the Colonie, unto which we promise all due submission \nand obedience.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral of the men aboard did not sign. Did they believe the document \nwas illegal?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe compact was modeled after the church covenant that the Pilgrims \nhad drafted and signed in l607 when they had first separated from the \nEnglish Church and fled to Holland. For the next fifty years, the \nMayflower compact served the Pilgrims well, and it became an \nimportant precedent for the idea of a written American Constitution \nat the Convention of l787.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCurtis, A.

    "title": "ONE OF THE MILK PEOPLE, DEATH OF IVAN PROKHANOW",
    "words": "Death of Ivan Prokhanov, One of the Milk People\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL based on a draft by Diane Severnac\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Molokans were a Russian sect dating from the late 18th century. \nMolokans believed the Bible was the soul's guide for salvation and \nrejected the rituals, icons, fasts, ornate churches, and worship of \nrelics that were common in the Orthodox Church. They were called \nMolokans or \"milk people\" because they drank milk during Orthodox \nfasts. The government sent many Molokans to the Caucasus. One such \nfamily was the Prokhanovs. In 1869, Ivan Prokhanov was born into this \nheritage. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was about ten years old, Ivan fainted and lay lifeless. A \ndoctor pronounced him dead, and he was placed in a coffin. But as the \nelders read the Bible over him, preparing to bury him, Ivan opened \nhis eyes and began to cry. In later life, he thought: \"Surely the \npower of the Omnipotent appointed me to live and to solve a special \nproblem set by Him for my life; another power, the power of death, \nwanted to cut my life short in its very beginning, but the power of \nthe Omnipotent overcame . . . and I was left to be on earth.\" \nRemembrance of this helped him in times of depression.\u0014\nReading Voltaire and Rousseau, Ivan grew confused about the purpose \nof life. In 1886, he took up a New Testament and saw Christ's claim, \n\"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man comes to the Father \nbut by me,\" (John 14:6). He read Paul's words, \"For me to live is \nChrist, to die is gain,\" (Philippains 1:21). He sought forgiveness \nfor his unbelief and thanked God for salvation. After that, he \nanchored his thinking in the optimistic belief that Christ has \novercome the world, despite our daily problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nIvan wanted to be useful to the Russian people. Like the Apostle \nPaul, he resolved to provide for his own needs while engaging in \nChristian work. And so he studied mechanical engineering at the \nInstitute of Technology in St. Petersburg. At the same time, he \ntaught children and preached. His meetings had to be kept secret, \nbecause religious gatherings were illegal outside the Orthodox \nChurch. As evangelical Christianity spread, Orthodox priests used \ntheir political clout to repress it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIvan was convinced that the Russian people needed spiritual reform \nmore than anything else. He wrote, \"No social or political reforms \ncould prove successful unless a moral and spiritual reform in the \npeople themselves was first realized.\" He produced an illegal \nChristian magazine. At one point, he had to flee to the West. When he \nreturned, he served as an engineer for Westinghouse Electric Company \nby day and as an evangelist and hymn writer by night. He established \na Bible school and organized youth groups. Often he did not get to \nbed until 2 A.M. Twice he was imprisoned for his faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in 1905, Russia enjoyed several years of religious freedom. \nIvan served as president of the All Russian Evangelical Christian \nUnion. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years before his death he wrote, \"As I look back, analyzing the \nevents of the past fifteen years, I cannot but see that every \nincident, every hindrance, even persecution and imprisonments, served \ndefinitely and positively for the growth of the Evangelical Christian \nMovement in Russia....\" He died in exile on this day, April 6, 1924, \nin Berlin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBernbaum, Dr. John A. \"Ivan Prokhanov and His Dream.\" \nRussian-American Christian University. \nhttp://www.racu.org/context/reflect_feb1996.html.\u0014\nBrandenburg, Hans.

    "words": "Obadiah Holmes Whipped for Baptist Beliefs\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nThud. The whip's three cords slammed onto the bare back of Obadiah \nHolmes, who stood tied to the post. Thud... Thud... Thud. Thirty \ntimes the executioner struck with all his force. It was on this day, \nSeptember 5, 1651 in Boston, Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to witnesses, Obadiah did not groan or scream. Instead, he \npreached to the crowd. When the whipping was over, he said, \"You have \nstruck me as with roses.\" To observers, it was obvious that he was \nbadly wounded. As a matter of fact, he was so hurt that he had to \nstay in Boston for several weeks while he recovered, and could only \neat while kneeling on his elbows and knees.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could he take this punishment so bravely? Obadiah was filled with \njoy because he considered that the Lord Jesus Christ had counted him \nworthy to suffer for the sake of truth. The beating came about \nbecause he crossed into Massachusetts from neighboring Rhode Island \nmerely to help a sick old man and held a Baptist service in a private \nhome in Puritan New England. Arrested with him were the Rev. John \nClarke and another man. If Obadiah had been willing to pay a fine of \n30 pounds he could have escaped the whipping. (30 pounds was a large \nsum of money for a poor man in those days; Obadiah's whole estate at \nhis death was valued at only 130 pounds.) But he was so sure that he \nwas right that he even refused to help his persecutors to unbutton \nhis shirt, much less pay the unjust fine.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the majority of inhabitants in New England, Obadiah was an \nimmigrant from England. He did not become a Baptist until he settled \nin Massachusetts. Unable to bear the civil restrictions in Salem, he \nmoved to Rehobath. There his teaching split the local church and he \nbecame leader of a small Baptist group. The colony's leaders ordered \nhim \"to desist, and neither to ordain officers, nor to baptize, nor \nto break bread together, nor yet to meet upon the first day of the \nweek...\" And so Obadiah and his wife moved to Rhode Island, setting \nup house for the third time since coming to America.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1652, Obadiah succeeded Clarke as pastor of the Newport Baptist \nChurch. He was only the second pastor of that congregation, which was \nthe second Baptist Church in the New World. He led them for almost \nexactly thirty years--until his death in 1682.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the very end, Obadiah kept his eyes on the things of God. He had \nnine children and 42 grandchildren when he died. Seven years before \nthe end, he wrote urging them to remember the meanings of their Bible \nnames, given to them to help them stick fast to Christ. He urged them \nto square their lives with scripture and to meet, support, \nstrengthen, and reprove one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nObadiah's testimony lived on long after the punishment was past. \nHenry Dunster was one of the best-educated men in Massachusetts when \nhe was given the job of founding Cambridge College (now Harvard \nUniversity). When it appeared to him that the state could not answer \nthe claims of John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes and Mr. Crandall, he \nstudied his Bible and came to the conclusion that the persecuted men \nwere correct. Shortly afterwards, he publicly refused to have his own \nnewborn child baptized. Because of this he was dismissed from the \nleadership of Harvard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Boston itself, Obadiah's suffering impressed others who \nestablished a Baptist church there, regardless of the colony's \ndisapproval. Holmes' Last Will and Testimony is a highly regarded \npiece of Baptist exhortation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor Holmes, James T. The American Family of Rev.

    "words": "\u0014\nThird Century AD---FIRST LAYING ON OF HANDS\u0014\n\u0014\nLaying on of hands as part of ordination is first attested in the \nthird century AD (Behm, Handauflegung, 72). The practice is \nunderstood to have come down from the apostles, and thereby from \nChrist himself. Although the noncanonical Acts of Peter asserts this \npractice, in a way, by saying that Christ laid his hands upon Peter, \nwhich could be viewed as a type of ordination \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time ordination appeared in the literature, laying on of hands \nas part of ordination was already widespread, and it is assumed as an \nestablished practice. In Didascalia 4, the bishop receives the laying \non of hands as part of installation to office. In a list of leaders \nfrom the time, Eusebius of Caesarea describes a bishop consecrating a \ncandidate as a presbyter by laying hands on him (Eusebius, \nEcclesiastical History, 7.32.21). This practice is also attested by \nCyprian in Africa and Spain.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCaulley, T. S. (2016). Ordination. In J. D. Barry, D. Bomar, D. R. \nBrown, R. Klippenstein, D. Mangum, C.

In third-century North Africa, presbyters \nand all the people elected and ordained bishops, who were consecrated \nby the laying on of hands by fellow bishops (Cyprian, Epistles 49; \n67; Stewart-Sykes, Ordination Rites, 124). Although the social \nsituation in North Africa was significantly different than in Rome \nand Asia, the basic structure of church offices and the ordination \nritual were maintained. However, those practices yielded different \nsocial meaning in relation to cultural attitudes toward patronage, \nand the payment of presbyters contrasted to the benefaction of \nbishops, among other factors (see Stewart-Sykes, Ordination Rites, \n12430).\u0014\nIn other third-century literature, there are further stipulations \nregarding a bishop (Didascalia Apostolorum, chapter 4):\u0014\n\u0014\n        he must be at least 50 years old (a presbyter must be at \nleast 30);\u0014\n        his wife must be a Christian and chaste;\u0014\n        his children must be God-fearing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCaulley, T.

As soon as he arrived on \nMolokai, he began trying to build friendships with the residents of \nthe leper colony, but they rejected him.  He poured himself into this \nministry, building a small chapel and holding worship services.  But \nhardly anyone came.\u0014\n   After 12 long years, he gave up.  While standing on the pier about \nto board the ship that would take him back to Belgium, he looked down \nat his hands.  The white spots he saw could mean only one thing.  He \nhad contracted leprosy.  So instead of going home, he returned to his \nwork in the leper colony.\u0014\n   The news of the missionary's disease spread through the community \nwithin hours, and soon the lepers--hundreds of them--had gathered \noutside his hut.  They understood his pain and despair.  The \nfollowing Sunday when Damien arrived at the chapel, the small \nbuilding was filled to overflowing.  That was the beginning of a long \nand fruitful ministry.\u0014\n   What made the difference?  Now the lepers knew that he understood \ntheir condition.  There was no question about whether he cared or \nnot.  In the same way, we have a God who has identified with our \nsituation.

The \nonlookers roared their disapproval, a command rang out, and he was \nkilled on the spot.  But his death was not in vain.  When the word \nspread that he was a devout man of God, and that he was protesting \nthis cruel sport, a hush fell over the huge stadium and many felt a \ndeep sense of shame.  That was the last gladiator contest in the \nRoman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Don't think that only gifted or well-known personalities can \nmake a great impact for God.

As soon as he arrived on \nMolokai, he began trying to build friendships with the residents of \nthe leper colony, but they rejected him.  He poured himself into this \nministry, building a small chapel and holding worship services.  But \nhardly anyone came.\u0014\n\u0014\n   After 12 long years, he gave up.  While standing on the pier about \nto board the ship that would take him back to Belgium, he looked down \nat his hands.  The white spots he saw could mean only one thing.  He \nhad contracted leprosy.  So instead of going home, he returned to his \nwork in the leper colony.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The news of the missionary's disease spread through the community \nwithin hours, and soon the lepers--hundreds of them--had gathered \noutside his hut.  They understood his pain and despair.  The \nfollowing Sunday when Damien arrived at the chapel, the small \nbuilding was filled to overflowing.  That was the beginning of a long \nand fruitful ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n   What made the difference?  Now the lepers knew that he understood \ntheir condition.  There was no question about whether he cared or \nnot.  In the same way, we have a God who has identified with our \nsituation.  Though without sin, our Savior experienced all the pain \nand frustration of earthly existence in order to bring us life.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Adapted from Moments for Pastors by Robert Strand.
