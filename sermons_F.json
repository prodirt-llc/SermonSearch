    "title": "FATHERS, INSTRUCT YOUR CHILDREN",
    "words": "\"The practice of catechism is the Christian equivalent of \nlooking at the box top of a jigsaw puzzle before one starts to put \nall of those hundreds of little pieces together.\"     As the \nChristian men's movement focuses a lot of attention on the role of \nmen in the home, fathers would do well to consider the wisdom of \nearlier generations regarding this vital area and reestablish the \npractice of catechism, which simply means instruction in the basic \ndoctrines of the faith.\u0014\n   Catechism does not replace the Bible but rather helps children \n(and adults) see the bigger picture.  The theological categories \nlearned through catechism make the details of the Scriptures more \nunderstandable.  Protestants have always believed that creeds, \nconfessions, and catechisms are only authoritative to the extent that \nthey accurately restate the teachings of Scripture, but as summary \nstatements they can serve as a springboard to more effective Bible \nstudy.\u0014\n   A cult always begins with a charismatic leader convincing his \nfollowers that he had found something in Scripture that everybody \nelse(especially the creeds, confessions, and catechisms) has missed.  \nSo learning a catechism not only alleviates biblical illiteracy but \ncan help safeguard young people from being taken in by the false \nteachings of a cult.\u0014\n   Protestant catechisms typically use a question- answer format, as \nin the well-known beginning of the Westminster Shorter Catechism of \n1648:  \"What is the chief end of man?  Man's chief end is to glorify \nGod and to enjoy Him forever.\"\u0014\n   One way for fathers to follow the scriptural injunctions to \ninstruct their children about God would be to use a catechism.  In \naddition, the pastor and elders of the church as well as the Sunday \nschool program should reinforce this home teaching.  Parents should \nnot, however, presume that the church will provide catechetical \ninstruction in place of their doing it at home.\u0014\n   One by-product of teaching one's children in this way is that the \nparents learn the material, too.  Many who learned the catechism as \nchildren have testified how later in life the memorized questions and \nanswers helped them when faced with situations of doubt or temptation.\u0014\n  \"Fathers, instruct your children\" by Kim Riddlebarger.

    "words": "\"The search for the good has yielded to the search for rights.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Once upon a time in America, men of stature recognized that \ndemocracy was dependent on \"the virtue, character, and moral input of \nits citizens.\"  Today, the type of laws our founding fathers framed \nwould be denounced as \"attempts to legislate morality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   This phenomenon is explored in Harvard professor Michael Sandel's \nbook Democracy's Discontent.  Sandel says America has become a \n\"procedural republic,\" in which government must remain neutral toward \nits citizens' moral and religious views. Moral issues are \n\"bracketed,\" that is, excluded from debate.  In their place, we are \nallowed to speak of individual rights, autonomy, and choice--but not \nmorals or virtue.\u0014\n\u0014\n   This has led to conclusions that would astound political leaders \nas recently as 40 years ago-- that one form of family cannot be \nesteemed more highly than another, for example, or that one must not \njudge the morality of welfare recipients.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The proponents of this procedural republic would find themselves \nin a dilemma, however, if they were thrust into the Lincoln-Douglas \nslavery debates (which bear striking resemblance to today's abortion \ndebates).  Douglas was pro- choice, declaring that the new \nterritories should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to \npermit slavery.  Lincoln insisted that \"policy should express moral \njudgment, not avoid it,\" and since he was utterly convinced of the \nimmorality of slavery, he was \"anti-choice\" in the debate. What would \ntoday's liberals do?  They'd want to side with Lincoln, but to do so \nwould violate their own \"strictures against appeals to comprehensive \nmoral ideals.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   A rights-based outlook severely restricts the open debate that is \nvital to a healthy democracy. Thankfully, there are a few rays of \nhope.  After many years of rights-talk about divorce, for example, \npeople are finally looking at it in terms of moral and social \nconsequences--especially for children.  May it be one step of many \ntoward restoring a balanced democracy, one that Lincoln would \nrecognize.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Forget Lincoln, what about me?\" by John Leo.

    "words": "\"It wasn't a problem that was aborted; it was my child.\"   \n--Anonymous father\u0014\n\u0014\n   Warren Williams can tell you how abortion affects the fathers \ninvolved.  He has counseled 65 postabortive fathers and found them \ndeeply troubled by guilt, fear of God's wrath, and sexual \ndysfunction.  It doesn't help that encouraging or allowing an \nabortion is one of those sins that you just can't talk about in \nchurch.  In some cases, the church's attitude is what drove an \nunmarried couple to seek an abortion in the first place.\u0014\n   The church expresses amazement at figures that show abortion to be \ncommonplace in the Christian community.  Yet this same church has \nfailed to help its young people understand their sexuality and \ndevelop biblical convictions about it.\u0014\n   So Christians find themselves among the growing number of men \nwhose entire masculine identity is threatened by postabortion \nsyndrome.  These men often struggle with \"fear of women and an \ninability to bond emotionally.\"  They may exhibit unusual rage, \nsometimes physical violence. Compliance in an abortion also tends to \nleave a man with an inability to keep commitments-- including those \nat work.\u0014\n   The father of an aborted child must begin the path to healing by \ntaking responsibility for what has happened.  Next, he must allow \nhimself to grieve over the child and over his sin.  With the help of \na mature believer, he should study the Scriptures relating to God's \nmercy, and seek forgiveness. The next step is education about \nbiblical manliness.  He needs to grasp the \"virtues of commitment, \nsacrifice, provision, protection, and unselfish intimacy,\" and then \npractice these virtues in his relationships.\u0014\n   Churches can help with each of these steps, but first they must \nend the reign of ignorance and secrecy, and speak openly about sexual \nsin and Christ's solution.  The pastor needs to preach clearly on \nfornication, adultery, and abortion-- and on repentance and healing \nthrough Christ. Youth programs and adult Bible studies can teach men \nabout sexual purity and help them withstand cultural pressures.  \nChurch leaders can seek the help of local crisis pregnancy centers, \nwho are often equipped to help men with postabortion syndrome.\u0014\n \"Fatherhood aborted\" by Guy Condon.

    "title": "FOUR BIG FAT LIES ABOUT KIDS",
    "words": "\"I've seen a steady, clomping parade of statements describing \nyoung people [negatively]-- many of them lies masquerading as truth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Generation X and the millennial generation which follows have \noften been portrayed negatively in Christian media.  Yet those \nconcerned with the young people should ask an important question \nabout these portrayals:  Are they accurate?  Four of the most \ncommonly heard complaints may not be accurate.\u0014\n   Today's kids are unable to discern right from wrong.  Josh \nMcDowell's 1995 book Right From Wrong reinforced this popular \nunderstanding.  McDowell says, \"Most of our youth lack the most basic \nmoral perspectives that previous generations took for granted.\"  \nWhile we may want to believe that previous generations had stronger \nmoral fiber, what did they actually do when faced with similar \nstruggles and temptations?  \"Young people [of previous generations] \nstruggled with moral boundaries, but those struggles remained largely \nprivate because there was no mass media to break down private \nboundaries and force them onto a public platform.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Today's kids have short attention spans. Modern teen thinking \nprocesses are different than any previous generation because these \nteens process massive amounts of information.  Instead of lamenting \nso-called short attention spans, the ability of today's kids have to \nprocess massive amounts of information should be seen as an asset, \nnot a liability.  \"They're not bored because they're shallow; they're \nbored because their minds are voracious, fast-paced info eaters.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Today's kids are not willing to commit.  While church attendance \nin overall is stagnant, teenagers are going to church in greater \nnumbers. They are not going because parents are making them, but \nbecause they want to go.  Teens are hungry for truth and meaning, and \nare willing to take initiative to find it.  They aren't unwilling to \ncommit, but they are cautious.  More than any other generation, \nthey've faced \"devastating betrayals\" from families broken by divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Today's kids are lazy.  The slacker label is one which has stuck \ntenaciously, but statistics documenting teen volunteer involvement \nreveal a different picture.  In 1996, 13.3 million teenagers \nvolunteered a total of 2.4 billion hours. Movements such as See You \nat the Pole, Teen Mania, True Love Waits, Urbana 96, Group Workcamps \nand World Vision's 30-Hour Famine challenging youth to live lives of \npurity, service, commitment, and integrity have had tremendous \nsuccess.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Four big fat lies about kids\" by Rick Lawrence.

    "words": "In the summer of 1994, there occurred the most\u0014\n                    devastating tragedy in the history of \n\"smokejumping.\"\u0014\n                    Smokejumpers are elite squads of firefighters,\u0014\n                    parachuting \"hot shots,\" who take great pride in \nbeing\u0014\n                    on the front lines of out-of-control wildfires.\u0014\n                    Smokejumpers constitute the first and most \ndangerous\u0014\n                    stage of defense for wilderness fires. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    On a windy day in July, on the appropriately named\u0014\n                    Storm Mountain in Colorado, the smokejumpers\u0014\n                    came too early on the scene. What had been another\u0014\n                    typical forest fire burning in the bottom of a \nsmall\u0014\n                    canyon was suddenly whipped by a strong, stray \nwind\u0014\n                    into an explosion of heat and flame which raced up\u0014\n                    the side of the canyon. Unlike almost everything \nelse\u0014\n                    in nature, fire travels faster uphill than down. \nThe elite\u0014\n                    crew of smoke-jumpers stationed along that ridge\u0014\n                    were engulfed in a firestorm so intense that \nescape\u0014\n                    was nearly impossible. Fourteen died before they\u0014\n                    could escape. The bodies of many of them were\u0014\n                    easily found because, in a last-ditch effort, \nthey pulled\u0014\n                    their shiny, foil-like, fire-resistant emergency \nshelters\u0014\n                    over themselves and hugged the ground. Alas, these\u0014\n                    flimsy barricades were no match for the fury of \nthe\u0014\n                    Storm Mountain fire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    In 1949, a similar disaster had been experienced \nby\u0014\n                    another team of smokejumpers. In a remote area of\u0014\n                    Montana called Mann Gulch, 12 men lost their lives\u0014\n                    when wind similarly whipped a small fire into a \nracing\u0014\n                    firestorm. Of the three men who escaped the blaze,\u0014\n                    one was the team's leader. As he watched his men\u0014\n                    trying to outrun -- uphill -- the speeding wall \nof fire,\u0014\n                    he realized they were in a losing battle. In \ndesperation,\u0014\n                    the crew leader decided to risk trying -- on the \nspot\u0014\n                    -- a new method of fire control no smoke-jumping\u0014\n                    team had yet employed. Instead of running away, \nthe\u0014\n                    squad leader stopped, turned and started another \nfire\u0014\n                    -- a so-called \"safety fire\" -- between himself \nand the\u0014\n                    blaze that followed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Most of the other smokejumpers thought their team\u0014\n                    leader had gone berserk. Surely they had more than\u0014\n                    enough fire already. He yelled for them to join \nhim\u0014\n                    behind this new safety fire, but they chose to \ncontinue\u0014\n                    trying to outrun the main fire. As the smaller \nfire\u0014\n                    burned toward the main blaze, it drew a safety \nzone\u0014\n                    behind itself that allowed the squad leader and \ntwo\u0014\n                    other men to escape. All the other smokejumpers\u0014\n                    perished.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"Fight fire with fire.\" We've heard the phrase \noften\u0014\n                    enough. How many of us would really dream of doing\u0014\n                    such a thing? We think of fire as something that \nmust\u0014\n                    be doused with water or buried alive in order to \nput it\u0014\n                    out. But sometimes, especially when the flames are\u0014\n                    life-threatening and lashing at our heels, the \nonly\u0014\n                    survival strategy that works is to \"fight fire \nwith fire.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Although the Bible makes no provision for the observance of Easter \nas the day of resurrection of Jesus, all evidence suggestions that \nthe celebration began very early, perhaps during the Apostolic Age.  \nIt also appears that early believers sought to create a Christian \nparallel to the Jewish Passover because of the close relationship \nbetween the significance of the event in the Old Testament and the \ncrucifixion in the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The name Easter is thought to have come from that of the \nAnglo-Saxon spring goddess, Eostre. As in the case of Christmas, \nhowever, the Christian feast of Easter has superseded the old pagan \nfestival.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The resurrection of Christi in the Greek and Romance tongues is \ndenoted by \"pascha\" (passover). Tyndale, Coverdale, and others give \n\"Easter\" as a rendering of \"pascha,\" and one example survives in the \nKing James version in Acts 12:4 (\"after Easter').  Other versions \nrender it \"after the Passover.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   During the second and third centuries, controversies arose over \nthe proper time for the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  It was \nfinally settled by the Council of Nicea in 325, which decreed that \nEaster be celebrated on the first Sunday after the vernal full moon \nand never on the 14th of Nisan (which would have tied it to the \nJewish Passover).\u0014",

It might \nfeed\u0014\nour desire for a gospel of success in business and good grades in \nschool,\u0014\nbut it would hardly be worthy of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u0014\nFortunately, Simon Peter saw more than just the miracle. He was \ncaptured by\u0014\nthe Lord behind the miracle. Thus, in-stead of responding with the \nbravado\u0014\nof a winner, he pleaded for forgiveness. Falling at Jesus knees, he \nbegged,\u0014\n\"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord.\" (Luke 5:8)\u0014\nAt first glance, that may seem an unlikely reaction to a moment of \nsuccess.\u0014\nSometimes, however, it is the experience of achievement which forces \nus to\u0014\nsee how superficial our vic-tories are. Andre Thornton, star home-run \nhitter\u0014\nwith the Cleveland Indians and an exemplary Christian, has predicted \nthat\u0014\nthere may be a very real religious awakening among ath-letes as a \nresult of\u0014\nthe exorbitant salaries so many are now receiving. He feels that when \nthey\u0014\nfind themselves suddenly so financially secure they will realize how \nlittle\u0014\ntheir wealth really means, and will thus be driven to look for deeper\u0014\nvalues.\u0014\nThe truth is, a person can have full nets but still have an empty \nlife.\u0014\nAfter youve sold the fish in the market and have put a share of the \nmoney\u0014\nin the bank, you may still feel an emptiness deeper than empty nets \nand a\u0014\nyearning more poignant than the desire for economic security.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.

    "words": "Harry Emerson Fosdick was the most famous preacher of his day but, as \na seminary student, he had suffered an emotional breakdown. He tried \nto commit suicide. Years later, in his autobiography, he talked about \nthat dark moment of his life. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe told how his intelligence and wit had always made life easy. His \ndetermination had always carried the day. When the \"going\" got tough, \nhe had always gotten tougher. But finally, he faced a situation that \nhe could not handle. He said of that moment, \"Self-confidence became \nludicrous.\" The techniques that had brought him success now failed. \nHe said: \u0014\n\u0014\n                        \"I who had thought myself strong,\u0014\n                             found myself beaten,\u0014\n                 unable to cope, not only with outward circumstances,\u0014\n                             but even with myself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In that experience I learned some things\u0014\n                      that theological seminaries do not teach.\u0014\n                             I learned to pray.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his deep need, as Fosdick prayed, he learned the true source of \nstrength and peace. He said:\u0014\n\u0014\n                              \"When I am weak,\u0014\n                       when I am at the end of my resources,\u0014\n                                 done for,\u0014\n                        where self-confidence is ludicrous,\u0014\n                            then I become strong.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of that experience, Fosdick penned this prayer:\u0014\n\u0014\n                            O God in restless living,\u0014\n                           We lose our spirit's peace.\u0014\n                           Calm our unwise confusion.\u0014\n                           Bid thou our clamor cease.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Let anxious hearts grow quiet,\u0014\n                           Like pools at evening, still,\u0014\n                           Till Thy reflected heavens,\u0014\n                               All our spirits fill.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Teach us beyond our striving,\u0014\n                            The rich rewards of rest.\u0014\n                          Who does not live serenely,\u0014\n                             Is never deeply blest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           O tranquil, radiant Sunlight,\u0014\n                         Bring Thou our lives to flower,\u0014\n                        Less wearied with our own effort,\u0014\n                        More filled with Thine own power.\u0014",

When the jar was filled to the \ntop\u0014\n and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, \"Is this jar full?\"\u0014\n \u0014\n Everyone in the class yelled, \"Yes.\"  The time management expert\u0014\n replied, \"Really?\"  He reached under the table and pulled out a \nbucket\u0014\n of gravel.  He dumped some of the gravel in and shook the jar causing\u0014\n the pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between \nthe\u0014\n big rocks.  He then asked the class once more if the jar was full.\u0014\n \u0014\n By this time the class was on to him and said \"Probably not\".\u0014\n \u0014\n \"Good\" he replied.

Once more he \nasked if\u0014\n the jar was full.\u0014\n \u0014\n \"NO!\" the class shouted.

    "title": "FUNDAMENTALISM IN AMERICA",
    "words": "Fundamentalism In America\u0014\nC. C. Goen\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism is sometimes erroneously identified, especially in the \nSouthwest, with the anti-convention agitations of a schismatic group \nof Baptists. This has caused some to lose sight of the larger aspects \nof the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy in American Christendom. \nIn an effort to broaden the perspective, this article presents a \nsurvey of Fundamentalism in terms of the developments which provoked \nit, the course of the controversy, and the issues involved. It is no \nmore than a simple summary description of the movement as viewed in \nthe total context of American Christianity.1\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLiberal Theology and the Social Gospel\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 1865 and 1914 the United States became the most highly \nindustrialized nation in the world. This period also brought vast \nnumbers of Europeans, who quickly found their places in the expanding \neconomy. Industrialization and immigration made for a phenomenal rise \nin the population of American cities, with all the social problems \nwhich inevitably attend such a development. Not the least of these \nwas the relation of the capitalist to his workers, a problem which \nwas aggravated by the unscrupulous methods of many businessmen to \namass more and more wealth. Free in this period from governmental \nrestraint, protected by high tariffs, and unhampered by any powerful \nlabor organization, many of the industrial magnates grew rapacious in \nthe extreme. Social and economic abuses were rife.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon the more sensitive churchmen began to criticize this turn of \nevents. The classic critique was that of Walter Rauschenbusch \n(1861-1918),\u0014\n\u0014\n[1The earliest study of Fundamentalism was by Stewart G. Cole, The\u0014\nHistor~' of Fundamentalism (New York: Richard R. Smith, 1931). \nAlthough out of date in some respects, this is still a helpful work. \nFor a survey of more recent literature, see Norman H. Maring, A New \nLook at Fundamentalism, Foundations; A Baptist Journal of History \nand Theology, I (October, 1958), 82-88. Provocative, though brief, is \nCarl Henry, Evangelical Responsibility in Contemporary Theology (Grand\u0014\nRapids:\tEerdman's, 1957).]\u0014\n\u0014\nwho pointed out that a social crisis was being precipitated because \nmost of the wealth and property was concentrated in the hands of a \nfew who were exploiting the masses and thus destroying the solidarity \nof society. Out of his experience as a Baptist pastor at Hell's \nKitchen in the slums of New York City, Rauschenbusch boldly declared \nthat individual personal religion was not sufficient to meet the \nneeds of an industrial society. That this sort of faith was professed \nby many of the business men, who were also church members, was a \nfactor which encouraged many churches and pastors to remain content \nwith the status quo. In contrast, Rauschenbusch sought to show that \nsin has an organic nature, that it affects groups as well as \nindividuals, that it manifests itself primarily as selfishness. The \ncure, he declared, was to revitalize society through the ethic of the \nkingdom of God, which kingdom he defined as society ordered \naccording to the will of God. This is the so-called Social Gospel.2 \nAlthough Rauschenbusch himself insisted on the necessity of personal \nregeneration, and taught that the kingdom was to be wrought by divine \npower through the efforts of dedicated men, his followers became more \nself-sufficient and spoke of building the kingdom much as if it \nwere to be their own doing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis fitted in quite well with the evolutionary philosophy which had \nwon fairly general acceptance in the latter part of the nineteenth \ncentury. Under its influence, the focus of interest in religion had \nshifted from transcendence to immanence: the doctrine of man stressed \nnow his likeness to God in goodness rather than his alienation from \nGod in sinfulness, while historical and rational criticism of the \nBible had turned it from an inspired revelation of God into a human \nstory of man's religious development. The new ethical ideal seemed \nnow to point the way toward further progress, and a new confidence in \nman and his future was born. Respect for science and the scientific \nmethod was rising rapidly, and already men like William James had \nengaged in empirical analyses of religious experience in an attempt \nto develop a science of religion. In such an atmosphere the \ntraditional metaphysical doctrines of Christology, hamartiology, \neschatology, predestination, all resting on in\u0014\n\u0014\n['Rauschenbusch's critique of society was \"Christianity and the Social\u0014\nCrisis\" (New York: Macmillan, 1907). His mature convictions found \nbest .d \u0014\n'I'J,pninni; far the Social GosDel (New York: Macmillan,]\u0014\n\u0014\nfallible, propositional revelation  would naturally find hard going. \nBesides all this, the country was imbued with democratic ideals. God \ncannot remain an Autocrat, Rauschenbusch exclaimed, while the world \nis moving toward democracy !\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of sporadic resistance to the new trends, a general \nbreak-through of liberal thought in America came at the close of the \nnineteenth century. Between 1890 and 1900 there arose a whole new \ngeneration of religious leaders who had made peace with the new \nscientific and social outlook, thus creating in the United States a \nnew theological Zeitgeist. There was thenceforth a determined effort \nto come to realistic terms with the contemporary world through \nfreedom of inquiry, openness to new truth, and tolerance of variant \nbeliefs, while continuing to retain the authority of Christian \nexperience and the centrality of Jesus Christ in nominal loyalty to \nhistoric Christianity. With this two-fold heritage of \nnineteenth-century scientism and the evangelical tradition, the \nliberals directed their rising social concern to the amelioration of \nthe problems delineated so trenchantly by Rauschenbusch. But a \nreaction was already aborning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist Controversy\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism is the name which came to be applied to the most \nextreme form of orthodox opposition to the new forms of thought. \nThere were, or course, wide ranges of belief among the conservatives; \nsome were concerned primarily to resist radical biblical criticism \nand naturalistic reductions of the gospel, while others were opposed \nto all innovations. This latter group represents the reactionary \nfringe of Fundamentalism, whose militant anti-intellectual bias \nprevented any constructive conversation with the liberals. But of \nprimary concern here are developments as they shaped up around the \ncentral issuewhich was the supernatural nature of biblical \nChristianity. The course of the controversy may be divided into three \nperiods.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly protests, 1865-19 10.  This period is characterized by various \nBible Conferences which met to decry a growing number of departures \nfrom the faith once for all delivered to the saints. The faith to be \ndefended was defined in the biblicistic terms of the seventeenth \ncentury, when elaborate Protestant creeds unequivocally identified \nthe Scriptures with the Word of God, verbally spired and infallibly \npreserved form all admixture of error.\u0014\n\u0014\n The famous Five Points of early Fundamentalism were enumerated at \nthe Niagara Bible Conference in 1895: inerrancy of the Scriptures, \nthe virgin birth of Christ, his substitutionary atonement, bodily \nresurrection, and personal return. Because many of the leaders in \nthese conferences had adopted the dispensational notions of J. N. \nDarby and the Plymouth Brethren (later popularized in this country \nthrough the Scofield Bible), the dispensational interpretation of the \nScriptures became standard for large numbers of Fundamentalists.8\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this period numerous Bible schools were founded, all set for \nthe defense of this faith, and all in more or less conscious \nopposition to the liberalism of most of the established seminaries. \nThe first was in 1882 at Nyack, New York, and was followed by Moody \nBible Institute in 1886; there were twenty-three such schools by \n1910. The period also witnessed numerous heresy trials in those \nchurches whose polity and doctrinal standards would admit such a \nprocedure. Notable examples are those in the Presbyterian Church, \nwhich dismissed Professors C. A. Briggs and H. P. Smith from its \nservice, while\u0014\nA. C. McGiffert resigned from the ministry before he was unfrocked as \na heretic.\u0014\n\u0014\nWidespread controversy, 1910-1929.  In this period the conservatives \nmade herculean efforts to capture control of the schools and mission \norganizations of the various embroiled denominations.4 The method \nusually resorted to was the proposal of doctrinal tests and creeds to \nwhich teachers and missionaries must subscribe. In every instance, \nhowever, the conservatives lost their case and began to see that \ntheir only alternatives were surrender or schism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1910-1912, twelve paper-backed pamphlets entitled The \nFundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth were published and distributed \nat the expense of the Stewart brothers (laymen) in California.5\u0014\n\u0014\n'[A recent account of the Bible Conferences may be found in C. Norman \nKraus, Dispensationalism in America (Richmond: John Knox Press, \n1958). Kraus views the transplantation to America of Darby's \ndispensationalism (in the 1860's) as the vanguard of Fundamentalism \nin this country. This is important because dispensationalism is, by \ndefinition, anti-ecc]esiastica].\u0014\n\u0014\n[4Perhaps the best factual study is by Norman F. Furniss, The \nFundamentalist Controversy, 1918-1931 (New Haven: Yale University \nPre~~. 1954). Separate chapters are devoted to developments in each \nof seven denominations.]\u0014\n\u0014\nEdited by A. C. Dixon and R. A. Torrey (other contributors included \nJames Orr, B. B. Warfield, E. Y. Mullins, C. B. Williams, G. Campbell \nMorgan, A. T. Pierson, and Charles R. Erdman), these little volumes \ngave sober and serious explication to the tenets of orthodox \nChristianity. Some 300,000 copies were sent free to pastors, \nevangelists, missionaries, theological students, Sunday School \nsuperintendents, and youth workers. Such wide circulation did much to \nbring the issues clearly into the open.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1919, the World's Christian Fundamentals Association was formed. \nLed by the Minneapolis Baptist minister, William Bell Riley, whose \nwidespread and indefatigable labors in behalf of orthodoxy had \nalready brought him into national prominence, this organization \nsought to bring together for cooperative action all those opposed to \nliberalism and the Social Gospel. Riley served as president of the \nAssociation until 1930; afterwards it declined and finally merged \nwith the Slavic Gospel Association in 1952.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1922, a highly inflammatory sermon entitled Shall the \nFundamentalists Win ? was preached by Harry Emerson Fosdick, a \nnominally Baptist preacher then supplying the pulpit of the First \nPresbyterian Church of New York City. This daring message flung down \nthe gauntlet, as it were, challenging a fight to the finish. In the \nuproar which followed, Baptists demanded Fosdick's resignation from \nthe ministry, while Presbyterians agitated for his removal from their \npulpit and the censuring of those who had permitted him to preach \nthere. The Fundamentalists won in none of these demands.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1925 came the famous monkey trial in Tennessee. After the state \nlegislature had passed a law against the teaching of evolution in any \nof its public schools, John T. Scopes, a young teacher in Dayton, \ndecided to provide a test case. In the ensuing litigation, he was \nprosecuted by William Jennings Bryan and defended by the brilliant \nagnostic, Clarence Darrow. The trial, a farce in many respects, \ndegenerated into a haggling argument between Bryan and Darrow over \nthe literal historical accuracy of the Genesis account of creation.\u0014\n\u0014\n'[It was the title of these works that gave the movement its name.\u0014\nThey were republished in four small volumes by the Bible Institute of\u0014\nLos Angeles in 1917. A new reprint, in two volumes, is now in \nprogress:\u0014\nCharles L. Feinberg (ed.), The Fundamentals for Today, Vol. I (Grand\u0014\nRapids:\tKregel Book Store, 1958)]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only ones to profit from the sorry spectacle were the merchants \nof Dayton, who catered to the large crowds of curiosity-seekers, and \nScopes, who received from friends funds to complete his Ph. D. in \nGeology at the University of Chicago.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1929, Princeton Seminary entered a crisis which was the turning \npoint of the controversy as far as the Presbyterians were concerned. \nA last-ditch effort to control the Seminary, led by J. Gresham \nMachen, was defeated. The conservatives withdrew to establish \nWestminster Seminary in Philadelphia; later, dissatisfied to \ncontribute through the missionary organizations of the denomination, \nthey formed their own mission board. In 1935 they constituted \nthemselves a separate body, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorthern Baptists were exercised almost as much as the Presbyterians. \nWithin their ranks were formed in 1921 the National Federation of \nFundamentalists and in 1923 the much more militant Baptist Bible \nUnion. The former was led by such moderates as A. C. Dixon and T. T. \nShields; the latter by reactionaries like W. B. Riley, T. T. Shields, \nand J. Frank Norris. Dissatisfaction with liberal trends in the \nseminaries led to the founding of Northern Baptist Seminary (Chicago) \nin 1913 and Eastern Baptist Seminary (Philadelphia) in 1925. In 1922 \na determined effort to pledge the Convention to the New Hampshire \nConfession of Faith was averted only by a substitute proposal to \ndeclare the New Testament as the all-sufficient rule of faith and \npractice. Although in 1925 a split was avoided by the narrowest \nmargin, the issue of modernism continued to be agitated until the \nconservatives finally withdrew in 1947.6\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most familiar figure in Fundamentalism among Southern \nBaptists was J. Frank Norris (1877-1952), whose vitriolic tirades \naroused Texas Baptists before the denomination as a whole was \nconcerned with the controversy. Making effective use of pulpit and \npress, he launched a belligerent attack against evolution in the \ncolleges and ecclesiasticism in the Convention. His \nultra-conservative doctrines and extreme premillennialism brought him \ninto the sympathies of\u0014\n'\u0014\n[See Chester E. Tulga,\"The Foreign Missions Controversy in the \nNorthern Baptist Convention. 1919-1947: Thirty Years of Strua rile\"]\u0014\n\u0014\nother Fundamentalist leaders; he became active in the World's \nChristian Fundamentals Association about 1922, and was instrumental \nin the formation of the Baptist Bible Union. Norris' own \ndenomination, the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship, was organized in \n1934, and its scope was greatly expanded when he assumed the \npastorate of the Temple Baptist Church in Detroit the next year  \nwithout, of course, relinquishing his leadership in Texas. It is \nscarcely necessary to observe that there is as much difference \nbetween Fundamentalists of this type and conservatives of the \nMachen-Mullins variety as between these latter men and the radical \nmodernists, though many liberals label them all as Fundies.T\u0014\n\u0014\nInterdenominational associations, 1930-present.  It is not strange \nthat both liberals and conservatives found more fellowship with \nkindred spirits in other denominations than with antagonists in their \nown. This last period has seen the formation of two major \nFundamentalist groups, besides a number of smaller provincial \norganizations, which are inderdenominational in composition. They are \nthe American Council of Christian Churches, led by Carl Mclntire \n(1941), and the National Association of Evangelicals (1942). Both of \nthese publish periodicals, transcribe religious programs for radio, \nlobby in Washington (on matters affecting the chaplaincy, radio \nregulations, foreign missions), and actively oppose the National \nCouncil of Churches  which is to them the most insidious voice of \nliberalism in the nation. Fundamentalism of this type maintains \nitself chiefly by negation of everything that does not coincide with \nits own peculiar views.8\u0014\n\u0014\nAn outstanding phenomenon of the present period, which also cuts \nacross denominational lines, is the activity of a group of men who \nare sometimes styled neo-evangelicals. Repudiating the Fundamentalist \nextremists who are theologically uninformed and socially unconcerned, \nthey are led by such men as Carl\u0014\n\u0014\n[7Brief surveys of several splinter Baptist groups may be found in \nThe Quarterly Review, XIX (April, May, June, 1959), 6-38. The \nevolution controversy within the Southern Baptist Convention is \ntreated tangentially (in connection with its impact on \necclesiological issues) by W. W. Barnes, The Southern Baptist \nConvention, 1845-1953 (Nashville:\u0014\nBroadman Press, 1954), pp. 257 f.\u0014\n'See Carl Mclntire, Twentieth Century Reformation (Collingswood, N. \nJ.: Christian Beacon Press, 1941). The story of the N.A.E. is told by \nJames DeForest Murch, Cooperation Withont Compromise (Grand Rapids:]\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry (editor of Christianity Today), E. J. Carnell (Fuller \nTheological Seminary), and Bernard Ramm (California Baptist \nTheological Seminary). This group belittles neither education nor \nmodern science, is possessed of a good historical sense, accepts the \nmost assured results of textual and historical criticism, and \nparticipates readily in contemporary theological conversation. Quite \narticulate in their position, they have authored several vigorous \ndoctrinal and apologetic works which seek to present historic \nChristianity in terms understandable by and acceptable to the modern \nworld.9\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Issues Involved\u0014\n\u0014\nMany efforts have been made to define Fundamentalism in terms of \nsociological factors. Some see it as a symptom of the conflict \nbetween the unsophisticated agrarian population and the urban \nintelligentsia. Others see it as part of the economic struggle \nbetween the proletarian desire for social betterment and the \nbourgeois effort to preserve the status quo. Some would find it a \nfurther manifestation of the cultural differences between certain \ngeographical sections of the country. Evidence, if it is carefully \nselected, can be adduced to support any or all of these theses.1o It \nwould seem more accurate, however, to characterize the whole movement \nas the eruption of a basic ideological conflict, a protest that \nsooner or later was bound to come against the romanticized humanism \nthat had captivated theology since the days of Schleiermacher. One \ncan admit the influence of social factors without positing them as \nprimary causes. The simple truth is that denials of the central \naffirmations of the Bible in the name of modernity could not have \ngone unnoticed in any society. Such protest movements  whether \nPietism or Wesleyanism or Kierkegaardianism or Barthianism or \nconfessionalism of one sort and another  seem to be an inevitable \npart of the dialectic in the historical process which bears along the \nChristian tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nFailure to penetrate to the heart of this controversy has resulted, \nin too many cases, in an unfortunate stereotyping of the whole \nconservative reaction to radical modernism. Fundamentalism  because \nit is often an umbrella term covering all\u0014\n'\u0014\n [See the symposium by Carl Henry (ed.), Contemporary Evangelical\u0014\n\u0014\nopposition to modernistic emasculations of Christian faith must not \nbe dismissed as either naive uncritical pietism or militant \nreactionary fideism. These are on the fringe, and biblical \nChristianity has profited little from their fierce but futile efforts \nto perpetuate the clichs of a forgotten century.'1 The i,entrat \nissue is the swpernaturat nature of Christianity. Thisl was given \nclassic formulation by a man of unquestioned erudition and \ntheological intensity, J. Gresham Machen.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn summary, his formulation amounts to this: Christianity must be \ndefined in terms of doctrine derived from the Bible rather than in \nterms of life growing out of religious experience. It is a message \nrather than a movement. It presents a great saving fact, not merely \nthe description of a feeling. Life is important, to be sure, but \ndoctrine is prior to life; that is, doctrine is not derived from \nreligious experience but is what conditions and determines such \nexperience. This is why much must be made of biblical authority: the \nBible represents the essentially trustworthy transmission of the \nmessage  it is the Word of God. Its central truths are the \ntranscendence of the living God, the special creation of man as a \nmoral personality, the universality and power of sin, the historical \nredemption provided by Jesus Christ the Son of God, the need of every \nperson for cleansing and quickening by the Holy Spirit, the \nincompleteness of time forms and the necessity for a final \nconsummation.12\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, this is a supernaturalistic conception all the way, and \nthe conservatives felt that to deny any portion of it was to imperil \nthe whole structure of saving truth  not because one must believe \nevery jot and tittle in order to be saved, but because to call into \nquestion any essential affirmation was to endanger the entire concept \nof biblical authority\u0014\n\u0014\n[If this seems too broad a definition, it is provoked by those who \nconsider everything to the right of themselves as Fundamentalist. \nFor a narrower view, see the definition essay by E. J. Carnell, \nFundamentalism, A Handbook of Christian Theology (New York: \nMeridian Books, 1958), pp. 142-144.\u0014\nJ. Gresham Machen, Christianity and Liberalism (New York:\u0014\nMacmillan, 1923). A more recent treatment from the same perspective \nis by Samuel G. Craig, Christianity Rightly So Called (Philadelphia:\u0014\nPresbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., 1946). Notice the sharp \nalternatives posed by these titles. Some conservatives of the present \nday, profiting from historical insights recently achieved, would not \ndivorce kerygma and church quite so radically as Machen.]\u0014\n\u0014\nand to vitiate the very essence of Christianity. Thus biblical \ninerrancy was always the storm center of the controversy, because an \ninfallible Bible seemed to be the only guarantee of a sure word from \nGod; and any relaxing of this conviction would lead inevitably to a \nhopeless relativism. The end of liberalism, it was feared, was to \nhumanize God and defy man, thus exposing Christianity to the \ncriticism of the psychologists that religion was merely a construct \nof the human imagination.'3 That is why the Fundamentalists felt that \nthey were fighting for the very soul of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe danger implicit in their approach, which many of them scarcely \navoided, is another sort of perversion of Christian faith and \nfellowship.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the vital experience of personal faith in Jesus Christ, \nfundamentalism has often substituted intellectual acceptance of the \ndoctrine of his deity, under-girded by a series of rational proofs. \nFor a body of Holy Scripture which is interwoven with the saving acts \nof God in history, fundamentalists substituted a static book of \ndoctrines and precepts, which is liable to all kinds of schemes, \neschatological charts, and creedal tests of fellowship.14\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recognition of this danger  a real debt to the insights of the \nliberals  is what distinguishes evangelical conservatives from the \nreactionary fringe. It permits both a border appreciation of the \ntotal Christian tradition and a deeper fellowship with those who \nserve the Savior in somewhat different ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe central conviction of the less reactionary Fundamentalists \nregarding the supernatural nature of Christianity has certainly been \njustified by the course of recent history. Theologians once again are \ncentering their attention on the God who acts in history to reveal \nhimself and redeem sinful men. The social upheavals of the twentieth \ncentury  wars, depressions, constant crises  have completely \ndestroyed the former confidence in the goodness of man and the \ninevitability of progress. The old liberal doctrines of immanence and \nperfectibility have had to be discarded. In their place have come a \nnew realization\u0014\n\u0014\n[lSThis thrust had already been made by Feuerbach.]\u0014\n\u0014\nof the perversity of men in sin, a new emphasis on the transcendence \nand sovereignty of God, a new category and locus of revelation in \nJesus Christ the Word, a new sense of the eschatological dimension of \nhistoric existence. And once again the God who is God, who in Christ \nhas reconciled the world to himself, is seen as the great Fundamental \nFact.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Southwestern Journal of Theology, October, 1959, p. 52\u0014",

    "words": "Frequency and Cost of Mental Illness:\u0014\nIt's More Than You Think\u0014\nBy Allan Tasman, M.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nMental illnessesschizophrenia, mood disorders, acute anxiety \ndisorders, alcohol and substance abuseare more widespread than most \npeople think. In any given year, more than 28% of us will experience \none of these devastating illnesses. You, someone in your family, or \nsomeone you know today is suffering a mental illness. Further, most \nsevere mental illnesses first appear during early adulthoodaffecting \nour most productive years.\u0014\nNo age group, though, is immune: seven million children and \nadolescents experience the symptoms of a mental disorder, with 5% \nexperiencing extreme functional impairment. Sadly, 50% of children \nwho need mental health help don't get it. Also, 1525% of people over \n65 suffer from significant symptoms of mental illnesses. Unrecognized \ndepression in the elderly often worsens the symptoms of other \nphysical illnesses and complicates care.\u0014\nSevere depression, which affects 810% of adults, will strike 17.5 \nmillion in the U.S. this year. By 2020, according to the World Health \nOrganization and the World Bank, due to suicide and associated health \nproblems, depression will be the world's second largest killer. \nDepression accounts for more disability than any disorder except \nheart disease.\u0014\nMental illnesses, when unrecognized, undiagnosed, and untreated, can \nwreak havoc upon our families, our physical health, our hearts and \nsouls, and our wallets and pocketbooks. Each time we turn on the IV, \nwe witness the results of these illnesses in reports of family \nviolence, suicide, runaway youth, and school invasions. Adolescent \nsuicide rates have tripled in the last decade.\u0014\nMore than 7% of people held in the nation's municipal jails are \nseriously mentally ill. When help is not at hand, more than 30,000 \npeople commit suicide each year, most suffering from a mental or \naddicting disorder. The loss of productivity due to untreated mental \nillnesses costs American society an estimated $150 billion a year, \nand most of this could be saved if care for mental illnesses was \ncovered the same as physical illnesses. Some states that require \nparity in health insurance coverage for physical and mental illnesses \nhave actually found that overall healthcare costs decreased. For \nexample, we know that each dollar spent for substance abuse treatment \nsaves seven dollars in societal costs.\u0014\nAnd mental illnesses do not stand alone. Research has identified new \nlinks between depression, cardiovascular illness, and other \nillnesses. Poor prenatal health is associated with future risk for \nmental illnesses, and there are relationships between anxiety \ndisorders and gastrointestinal illnesses. Bone loss in men is now \nseen as one result of severe and chronic depression; eating disorders \nare commonly believed to contribute to heart disease; and stroke \nvictims who are treated for depression improve more rapidly and live \nlonger.\u0014\nThe good news is that mental illnesseslike most other illnesses \naffecting our fellow citizenscan be readily diagnosed and \neffectively treated. According to the U.S. Surgeon General's 1999 \nreport on mental health*, tens of thousands who need care don't \nreceive it because of discriminatory restrictions on payment and \naccess to effective mental illness treatment services. By improving \naccess to quality mental health care, we can save lives, improve \nfamily stability, increase workplace productivity, and lessen the \neconomic strain on our overburdened healthcare system. The Surgeon \nGeneral rightly calls for an end to stigmatization and for 'a \nsocietal resolve that we will make the needed investment in \nappropriate mental health care for all who need it.\u0014\n~To request a copy of the report, call 1-877-9-MHEALTH or visit \nhttp://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nHow well do you know your high school chemistry? Do you recall \nPascal's Law?\u0014\nIt describes the effect of applying pressure on a liquid in a closed \ncontainer.\u0014\nChanges in pressure in a confined liquid will be distributed equally \nthroughout\u0014\nthe fluid. For example, a thin bottle will break when a cork is \npushed down far\u0014\nenough. This principle is used today in hydraulics for presses, \nelevators,\u0014\njacks, vacuum pumps and air compressors.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662), an amazing French philosopher, is known \ntoday\u0014\nfor his work in math, chemistry and religion. His father tried to \neducate him\u0014\nin ancient languages. However, at age 12, Blaise had discovered \ngeometry\u0014\nand at 16 wrote \"The Geometry of Conics,\" which is now lost. He also\u0014\ninvented the calculating machine and the theory of probability, used \nin card\u0014\ngames.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his mid-thirties, Pascal became interested in religion. He wrote:: \n\"Within\u0014\neach one of us there is a God-shaped vacuum that only God can fill.\" \nLater,\u0014\nhe wrote another book, \"An Apology for the Christian Religion.\" In it \nhe\u0014\nmaintained that perfect knowledge arrived through Christian \nrevelation.\u0014\nPascal believed that faith is a sounder guide than reason; he wrote: \n\"Reason\u0014\ncan go only so far, but faith in God has no limits.\" Thus, reason \u0014\nhits a wall but faith opens a window, allowing fresh air and sunshine \nto infiltrate.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal understood that man has a dilemma. His conscious mind tells \nhim he is\u0014\nimpure against a perfect Creator and he tries to reason it out. Man \nhas\u0014\nsupine indifference, lust, pride, selfishness, an alcoholic problem, \nor not\u0014\nfeeling self-fulfilled, self-actualized. He plays mindless games to \nunderstand\u0014\nand rationalize his dilemma but he finally realizes that his impurity \ncheats\u0014\nhim out of being in harmony with God, creating a vacuum. Pascal \nadmitted\u0014\nthat this God-shaped vacuum was created within each of us that only \nHe can\u0014\nfill. No wide amount of reasoning could eradicate it - only faith in \nGod can\u0014\nsupplant it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlaise Pascal's scientific mind has affected the world even to this \nday. Yet\u0014\nhe pointed to Jesus Christ, who can fill our vacuum, our being, in \norder that\u0014\nwe may have the final assurance that our lives may have order - not \nchaos,\u0014\nfull and not empty, pressurized, not a vacuum.

    "title": "FORGIVE AND REMEMBER",
    "words": "Forgive and Remember\u0014\n\u0014\nA year after the Clinton impeachment, can we get some perspective? \u0014\nBy David P. Gushee \u0014\n\u0014\n Just a little over a year ago the U.S. House of Representatives \nvoted to impeach a president for only the second time in American \nhistory. Two months later, after a five-week trial in the Senate, \nPresident Clinton was acquitted of two articles of impeachment, one \non perjury, the other on obstruction of justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time, of course, many claimed that the impeachment of \nPresident Clinton was a watershed. No history of the Clinton years \nwould be written without prominently featuring the Lewinsky scandal \nand the impeachment. Beyond this, however, there was little agreement.\u0014\nOne year later, is it possible to consider the lessons of the \nimpeachment and acquittal of President Clinton with fairness and a \nmeasure of objectivity? With some distance, what are we to make of \nthe tumultuous events of those days? To make a statement that every \nChristian reader will agree with is impossible, but that is not my \ngoal. I offer instead one Christians reflections. \u0014\n\u0014\nLESSON 1. POLITICS IS A VICIOUS CONTEST FOR POWER--HANDLE WITH CARE. \nIn some societies that contest takes place through the barrel of a \ngun. Thankfully, here in this country we use the ballot box. Yet so \nmuch that occurs at the highest level of our politics is sordid, \nvicious, devious, and brutal. \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Clinton provided considerable opportunity for his enemies \nto destroy him. But that he had enemies who wanted to destroy him and \nwere working hard to do so is by now quite clear. Once people like \nLucianne Goldberg (the literary agent who urged Linda Tripp to turn \nher tapes over to Kenneth Starr) had Clinton in their sights, they \nwere determined to bring him down. Likewise the president was \ndetermined to evade the fatal blow and made use of every means \navailable to elude his foes. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe are often nave about what actually goes on in the centers of \npolitical power, which makes us easily leveraged by those who play \nthe game full time and for keeps. For most of the churchs history a \nstrand of Christian thought has tried to keep the Christian faith \nclear of power-based entanglements. That perspective had not been \nvery visible in recent years. Since the Lewinsky scandal, however, it \nhas surfaced again. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe impeachment drama has reminded all of us that those Christians \nwho are called to national politics face an excruciatingly demanding \nvocation. The moral compromises that tempt the Christian politician \nwould stagger most of the rest of us. Political engagement should not \nbe taken off the table as an element of Christian engagement with \nculture. But the church should take this opportunity to refocus its \nenergies on evangelism and disciplemaking as the primary means for \nadvancing the gospel. \u0014\n\u0014\nLESSON 2. POLITICS IS NOT A GAME--RESTORE ITS GRAVITY. We learned \nlast year, if we didnt already know it, that American politics \napparently does not primarily involve people who seek with all their \nhearts to advance broad national or humanitarian interests. Perhaps \nbecause we face so little real threat to national survival, or maybe \nbecause of the broad deterioration of our national character, our \nnations political life is characterized by self-interested \ngamesmanship more than inspiring statesmanship. \u0014\nHow we long for people with a rich political and moral vision who \nwork hard for just causes, whether in power or out and whether their \ncauses are popular or not. A handful of politicians fits this \ndescription--Mark Hatfield (former senator from Oregon), Paul Henry \n(deceased former Congressman from Michigan), and Tony Hall (a current \nCongressman from Ohio) come to mind. There are certainly others. \u0014\n\u0014\nMainly, though, we play at politics as we do at horseracing, poker, \nand the lottery. But while we play games, regimes rise and fall, \nnuclear weapons continue to spread, children die of hunger, abortion \nclaims the lives of millions, and ethnic tribalism destroys its \nhapless victims. Christians must always call the nation and its \nleaders back to the dignity and significance of the work of \ngovernment, which Paul called \"Gods servant for [our] good\" (Rom. \n13:4). \u0014\n\u0014\nLESSON 3. THE BEST POLITICAL LEADERS ARE POLITICALLY EFFECTIVE AND \nMORALLY ADMIRABLE BOTH IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIFE--LOOK FOR THE TOTAL \nPACKAGE. The link between political effectiveness and personal \ncharacter isnt straightforward. It is possible to be an effective \nbut not morally admirable president. Many believe that Bill Clinton \nbasically fits this description. Many would also place both Richard \nNixon and Lyndon Johnson (at least until Vietnam consumed his \npresidency) in this camp. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is possible to be morally admirable but not terribly effective. \nWhether fairly or not, Jimmy Carter is widely viewed as the best \nrecent example of this combination. Some would place Woodrow Wilson \nin this category. The combination of ineffectiveness and moral \nmediocrity is also possible (e.g., Warren G. Harding). \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery so often we are blessed with both effectiveness and integrity. \nAbraham Lincoln quickly comes to mind, but there are not many other \ncandidates for this high honor--which may show us how difficult it is \nto hold high political office with both effectiveness and character \nintact. \u0014\nFurther, there is both a link and a distinction between private and \npublic morality. The link is that the same human being operates both \nin the private and the public realms--it is from the \"heart\" (Mark \n7:21) that all human actions proceed. Character is revealed in every \naction. The distinction is that an officeholder is primarily \nresponsible to the public for conducting the public business of that \noffice responsibly. That public business consists of the evaluation, \npromotion, and implementation of public policies that affect the \ncommon good. It is certainly possible to combine a stellar private \nmorality with an unbiblical public morality--and vice versa. \u0014\nAs Christians, we should seek the total package: private moral \nrectitude, biblical public morality, and political effectiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\nLESSON 4. CHRISTIANITY IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN AMERICAN PUBLIC \nLIFE--WATCH FOR ITS POLITICAL MANIPULATION. We are a remarkably \n\"religious\" nation, and so all who would seek political office--at \nleast at the national level--feel compelled to make a show of \nreligious identification. Anyone who opposes Christian (or \nJudeo-Christian) convictions and values risks his political future, \nas Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura learned in the wake of his \ninfamous interview with Playboy. \u0014\n\u0014\nHypocrisy, religious sham, and the abuse of religious language and \nsymbols are probably inevitable, given American religiosity. I shared \nthe view of many at the time that President Clintons use of the \nlanguage of repentance and forgiveness during the impeachment crisis \nwas at best dubious. While no one can get inside another persons \nsoul, one can examine public acts for the fruit of repentance. These \nappeared to be lacking. \u0014\nNot all will agree with my perception. But there was much evidence at \nthe time that the president hoped to preempt the impeachment process, \nor influence its outcome, through strategically employing the \nlanguage of repentance. But some who sought Clintons political \ndestruction--even before he became president or before the Monica \nLewinsky event--also abused religious language as they used it to \ncudgel him and to influence public debate. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps a nation that wants public religiosity is better than one \nthat has abandoned it. Having traveled in Europe, I prefer our own \nreligiously vibrant public square to the sterile secularity in what \nused to be the heart of Christendom. But what you get with the \nexpectation of religiosity--and the political benefits of \nreligiosity--is the abuse of religiosity. Christians of all political \npersuasions need to become much more shrewd in noting and discounting \nhypocritical shows of public Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nLESSON 5. THE MORAL FABRIC OF THE NATION IS IN WORSE SHAPE THAN WE \nKNEW--LEARN THE CULTURE. The casual response of many Americans to the \npresidents sexual misconduct and deceit fits with what we know about \nthe changing lifestyle and values of the American people. Americans, \nincluding all too many Christians, routinely violate biblical moral \nstandards related to the covenantal relationships of life--sex, \nmarriage, and family above all. A quick look at the adultery, \ndivorce, and abuse statistics bears this out. \u0014\nSo, sadly enough, the presidents misconduct corresponded with the \nlives of millions of Americans, rather than arousing their moral \noutrage. I vividly recall being a guest on several call-in radio \nprograms here in conservative west Tennessee and hearing the \n\"everybody does it, so whats the big deal?\" perspective again and \nagain. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery so often the church gets a wake-up call about the surrounding \nculture. This has been one such wake-up call. The reality is \ndifficult and discouraging, but we can undertake our mission most \neffectively if we know where we are. We need to get out from our \nevangelical ghetto and learn the culture. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn just over a year Bill Clinton will be out of office. Future \nhistorians will judge his presidency. The nation has not collapsed \nthrough either the impeachment process or his serving out his term, \nas the most hysterical voices on either side suggested at the time. \nIn retrospect, many important truths have been learned. A sobered yet \nstill resolute evangelical world, having learned the appropriate \nlessons, needs to regroup and continue its engagement with American \npolitics and culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid P.

    "words": "A Pastor had a kitten that climbed up a tree in his backyard and then \nwas\u0014\nafraid to come down. The pastor coaxed, offered warm milk, etc. The \nkitty\u0014\nwould not come down. The tree was not sturdy enough to climb, so the\u0014\npastor decided that if he tied a rope to his car and drove away so \nthat\u0014\nthe tree bent down, he could then reach up and get the kitten. He did \nall\u0014\nthis, checking his progress in the car frequently, then figured if he \nwent\u0014\njust a little bit further, the tree would be bent sufficiently for \nhim to\u0014\nreach the kitten. But as he moved a little further forward... the rope\u0014\nbroke. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tree went \"boing!\" and the kitten instantly sailed through the \nair -\u0014\nout of sight. The pastor felt terrible. He walked all over the\u0014\nneighborhood asking people if they'd seen a little kitten. Nobody had \nseen\u0014\na stray kitten. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, he prayed, \"Lord, I just commit this kitten to your keeping,\" and \nwent\u0014\non about his business. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later he was at the grocery store, and met one of his \nchurch\u0014\nmembers. He happened to look into her shopping cart and was amazed to \nsee\u0014\ncat food. Now this woman was a cat hater and everyone knew it, so he \nasked\u0014\nher, \"Why are you buying cat food when you hate cats so much?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe replied, \"You won't believe this,\" and told him how her little \ngirl\u0014\nhad been begging her for a cat, but she kept refusing. Then a few days\u0014\nbefore, the child had begged again, so the Mom finally told her little\u0014\ngirl, \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, if God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it.\" She told the \npastor,\u0014\n\"I watched my child go out in the yard, get on her knees, and ask God \nfor\u0014\na cat. And really, Pastor, you won't believe this, but I saw it with \nmy\u0014\nown eyes. A kitten suddenly came flying out of the blue sky, with its \npaws\u0014\nspread out, and landed right in front of her.\"\u0014",

As many as 2000 \npeople\u0014\n                      attended his funeral, lining up for one last \nlook or a pat on the neck\u0014\n                      and racing fans all over the country mourned \nhim. Today his grave is\u0014\n                      marked by the famous Man O'War statue by \nHaseltine at the\u0014\n                      Kentucky Horse Park. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even 50 years later when racing is not\u0014\n                      nearly as popular, almost everyone has\u0014\n                      heard of Man O'War. He is the yardstick\u0014\n                      that greatness is still measured against in\u0014\n                      horse racing. His lifetime record was 21\u0014\n                      starts with 20 wins and a second place and\u0014\n                      he retired as the leading money winner in\u0014\n                      America at the time. He set 8 records, 3\u0014\n                      world records, 2 American records, and 3\u0014\n                      track records and broke most by several\u0014\n                      seconds. He carried as much as 138\u0014\n                      pounds, conceding as much as 30 pounds\u0014\n                      to his rivals and still beat them by large\u0014\n                      margins. He was so superior to other horses of \nhis time that the\u0014\n                      Jockey Club handicapper said he would put more \nweight on him than\u0014\n                      any horse had ever carried as a 4 year old. \nRather than tempt fate and\u0014\n                      risk a breakdown under ridiculously heavy \nweights, his owner opted to\u0014\n                      retire him after his 3 year old campaign. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As a sire, he had many excellent offspring \nincluding the Triple Crown\u0014\n                      winner War Admiral. His stud career is often \ndescribed as\u0014\n                      mismanaged as his owner mostly allowed him to \nbe bred to only to his\u0014\n                      own mares. Had he been handled better, there is \nno telling how\u0014\n                      influential he could have been. As it is, he \nstill appears in many\u0014\n                      pedigrees of today's thoroughbreds but mostly \nvia his daughters who\u0014\n                      became excellent broodmares. His sire line \nstill survives today in a\u0014\n                      few stallions like Relaunch.\u0014",

Under the leadership \nof Warren Wright Sr.,\u0014\n                                  Ben Jones, and later his son, \nHorace A. \"Jimmy\" Jones,\u0014\n                                  Calumet stormed to the forefront of \nThoroughbred racing.\u0014\n                                  During this period, Calumet led the \nlist of Leading\u0014\n                                  Money-Winning Owners seven times. \nIn 1947 the farm\u0014\n                                  became the first to exceed $1 \nmillion in purse earnings.

In just 19               \nyears he had built a turf giant. The solid foundation laid by Wright, \nthe expertise of              trainers Ben and JimmyJones, and the \nguidance of his widow, Lucille Parker                      Wright, \nwould ensure Calumet's lofty position for yet another decade.\u0014\n\u0014\n           1940 - 1941\u0014\n\u0014\n                Entering 1940, Warren Wright Sr. had assembled all of \nthe necessary tools to\u0014\n                establish his racing dynasty. He had the trainer and \nhe had the horses. The next 10\u0014\n                years proved to be the most glorious decade ever \nexperienced by an American\u0014\n                racing stable. Calumet had arrived. The farm \nemergence as a racing power was\u0014\n                heralded in 1940 by Whirlaway, a 2-year-old colt by \nBlenheim II, out of Dustwhirl.\u0014\n                Although somewhat erratic at 2, he captured 7 of his \n16 starts, including the Saratoga\u0014\n                Special and the Hopeful Stakes. His earnings for the \nyear were $77,275.50, vaulting\u0014\n                Calumet to third on the list of Leading Money-Winning \nOwners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                          Whirlaway began his 1941 \ncampaign with the\u0014\n                                          same tendency to bolt \ntoward the outside rail that\u0014\n                                          he had exhibited as a 2 \nyear-old. Ben Jones was\u0014\n                                          able to correct this \nproblem prior to the\u0014\n                                          Kentucky Derby by modifying \nWhirlaway's\u0014\n                                          blinkers, resulting in his \n8-length Derby victory in\u0014\n                                          a record time of 2:01 2/5. \nWhirlaway went on to\u0014\n                                          become Calumet's first \nTriple Crown winner,\u0014\n                finishing the year with 13 wins in 20 starts and \ncapturing the 1941 Horse of the Year\u0014\n                title.\u0014\n\u0014\n                Supported by a fine 2-year-old class including Some \nChance (c.), Sun Again (c.), and\u0014\n                Mar-Kell (f.), Whirlaway catapulted Calumet to its \nfirst number-one ranking on the\u0014\n                list of Leading Money-Winning Owners with total \nearnings of $475,091.\u0014\n\u0014\n           1942 - 1943\u0014\n\u0014\n                Whirlaway returned in 1942, winning 12 of his 22 \nstarts and again being voted Horse\u0014\n                of the Year. On July 17, he became the world's \nleading money-winner by winning\u0014\n                the Massachusets Handicap. By year's end he had \namassed $560,911.50, making\u0014\n                him racing's first $500,000 earner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                Bolstered by an excellent group of homebred fillies, \n1943again found Calumet at the\u0014\n                top of the list of leading money-winners. \nTwo-year-old fillies Twlight Tear and Miss\u0014\n                Keeneland joined with Nellie L. (f.,3) and Handicap \nMare of 1943, Mar-Kell (f.,4),\u0014\n                to help the farm post combined earnings of $267,940. \nIn winning the Handicap Mare\u0014\n                championship, Mar-Kell posted victories in four \nstakes races, including the\u0014\n                prestigious Beldame Handicap. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Whirlaway returned at 5 to start twice and was then \nretired to stud with a cumulative\u0014\n                record of 32 victories in 60 starts and total \nearnings of $561,161.50. He later was\u0014\n                leased to Marcel Boussac to stand in France, where he \ndied in 1953 with 17 stakes\u0014\n                winners to his credit.\u0014\n\u0014\n           1944 - 1946\u0014\n\u0014\n                In 1944, Twilight Tear (f,3) became the first filly \nto be voted Horse of the Year. Of\u0014\n                                         her 17 starts she won 14, \nincluding a string of 11\u0014\n                                         straight victories. Her \nearnings for the year were\u0014\n                                         $167,555. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                         Her male counterpart in \n1944, Pensive (c,3) was\u0014\n                                         considered a good but not \ngreat colt. His success\u0014\n                                         to a large measure reflected \nthe training genius of\u0014\n                                         Ben Jones. Although he would \nwin but three\u0014\n                stakes races that year, two of these were the \nKentucky Derby and the Preakness.\u0014\n                He came very close to becoming Calumet's second \nTriple Crown winner, finishing\u0014\n                second in the Belmont by one-half length. His \nearnings for the year were $162,225. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Sun Again (h,5), Pot O'Luck (c,2), Mar-Kell (m,5), \nGood Blood (f, 2), and Twosy\u0014\n                (f,2) combined with Twilight Tear and Pensive to \nboost Calumet to a record-earning\u0014\n                year with total winnings of $601,660. \u0014\n\u0014\n                In 1945, Calumet slipped to third on the list of \nLeading Money-Winning Owners with\u0014\n                $371,660 in earnings. Twilight Tear, Horse of the \nYear in 1944, bled in her only start\u0014\n                at 4 and was retired to a successful career as a \nbroodmare. The top gun for Calumet\u0014\n                in '45 was Pot O'Luck won 5 of his 21 starts, \nincluding the Jockey Club Gold Cup.\u0014\n                He finished second in the Kentucky Derby and had \nearnings for the year of\u0014\n                $149,220. Pot O'Luck's efforts were supported by \nArmed, a 4-year-old gelding by\u0014\n                Bull Lea. Armed won 10 of his 15 starts and earned \n$91,500. \u0014\n\u0014\n                In 1946, led by Armed, Calumet again claimed the top \nspot on the list of Leading\u0014\n                Money-Winning Owners with $564,095 in earnings. Armed \nwon 11 of his 18 starts,\u0014\n                including the Widener Handicap and the Suburban \nHandicap. His earnings for the\u0014\n                year were $288,725. Armed was supported by the \n4-year-old filly Good Blood, which\u0014\n                posted winnings of $60,875. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Early in 1947, Ben Jones assumed the title of Racing \nStable General Manager and\u0014\n                named his son and assistant, H.A. \"Jimmy\" Jones, as \ntrainer. It was then decided to\u0014\n                split the stable, with Ben Jones campaigning his half \nin the East while Jimmy Jones\u0014\n                took his portion to California. This arrangement \ncontinued until late 1952.\u0014\n\u0014\n           1947 - 1950\u0014\n\u0014\n                In 1947, Calumet had the greatest year of any farm in \nthe history of Thoroughbred\u0014\n                racing. The $1,402,436 earned by Calumet horses was \nmore than double any stable's\u0014\n                previous earnings. The farm not only captured Horse \nof the Year and Champion\u0014\n                Handicap Horse honors with 6-year-old Armed, but also \ntook 2-year-old and\u0014\n                2-year-old colt honors with Citation and the \n2-year-old Filly title with Bewitch. In\u0014\n                addition, Bull Lea was the nation's Leading Sire, and \nPotheen was named\u0014\n                Broodmare of the Year. The stable collected a record \n100 victories in 1947, with 36\u0014\n                money-winning performers and 10 stakes winners. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Armed led the Calumet barrage, winning 11 of his 18 \nstarts with earnings of\u0014\n                $376,325. As a 2-year-old, Citation won 8 of his 9 \nstarts, his only loss being to\u0014\n                stablemate Bewitch in the Washington Park Futurity. \nBewitch posted 7 additional\u0014\n                victories, including Calumet's third Preakness. \nFervent (c,3) also contributed, winning\u0014\n                4 stakes races, including the American Derby and the \nPimlico Special. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                         In 1948, Calumet continued \nits relentless assault\u0014\n                                         on the racing world. \nThree-year-old Citation, to be\u0014\n                                         named Horse of the Year, was \nalmost unbeatable,\u0014\n                                         winning 19 of his 20 starts \nand capturing\u0014\n                                         Calumet's second Triple \nCrown. His $709,470 in\u0014\n                                         earnings established a new \nrecord. His\u0014\n                                         stablemate, 3-year-old \nCoaltown, had total\u0014\n                                         winnings of $104,650 en \nroute to capturing the\u0014\n                                         Champion Sprinter title, and \n4-year-old Fervent\u0014\n                contributed $123,775 by winning 6 of his 12 starts, \nincluding the Equipoise Mile and\u0014\n                Washington Park Handicap. P> Citation did not start \nduring the 1949 campaign due\u0014\n                to an injury, but his presence was hardly missed. \nCoaltown, racing in many of the\u0014\n                events in which Citation would have been entered, won \n12 of his 15 starts and was\u0014\n                voted Handicap Horse of 1949. Ponder, a 3-year-old \nPensive colt, picked up 9\u0014\n                victories, including Calumet's fourth Kentucky Derby. \nCalumet fillies also did their\u0014\n                share, with Bewitch taking Handicap Mare honors and \nTwo Lea and Wistful sharing\u0014\n                the 3-year-old Filly title. Wistful also handed the \nstable its first National Filly Triple\u0014\n                Crown by capturing the Kentucky Oaks, Pimlico Oaks, \nand Coaching Club\u0014\n                American Oaks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                In 1950, Calumet dropped to second on the list of \nLeading Money-Winning Owners\u0014\n                after four consecutive first-place finishes. Citation \nnever returned to his 3-year-old\u0014\n                form, but during his 5-year-old campaign he did \nbecome the world's leading\u0014\n                money-winner at $924,630 while winning the Golden \nGate Mile. Both Ponder and\u0014\n                Two Lea had successful 4-year-old campaigns, with \nPonder earning $219,000 and\u0014\n                Two Lea taking Handicap Mare honors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                The year and an incomparable era were brought to a \nclose when, on December 28,\u0014\n                Warren Wright Sr. died at his winter home in Miami \nBeach. His achievements\u0014\n                during his 19 years as master of Calumet will forever \nmark him as one of the giants\u0014\n                in the history of Thoroughbred breeding and racing, \nand the continued success of the\u0014\n                farm would serve as a lasting memorial to the solid \nfoundation that he had laid.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 \u0014\n\u0014\n                             WARREN WRIGHT SR. \u0014\n                                        1875-1950\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Warren Wright Sr. A native of \nSpringfield, Ohio, became\u0014\n                                  an office boy for the family \nbusiness, the Calumet Baking\u0014\n                                  Powder Company, at age 15. Nine \nyears later he\u0014\n                                  succeeded his father, William \nMonroe Wright, as president.\u0014\n                                  Under his guidance the company \nprospered and, in 1928,\u0014\n                                  was sold to General Foods for an \nestimated $40 million \u0014\n\u0014\n                                  In 1931, Warren Wright inherited \nCalumet Farm from his\u0014\n                                  father and immediately began its \ntransformation to\u0014\n                                  Thoroughbred racing and breeding. \nWright was a\u0014\n                                  methodical man who approached his \nnew venture into\u0014\n                                  racing with the same attitude of \nefficiency that he applied\u0014\n                to business. His first decade as master of Calumet \nwas primarily formative although\u0014\n                the stable ranked in the top ten money-winning owners \nas early as 1934 and again in\u0014\n                1936, '37, '38, and '40. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Calumet truly arrived in 1941 with Whirlaway. The \nnext 10 years would bear the\u0014\n                fruits of Wright's labors and establish a standard of \nexcellence which continues\u0014\n                today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Warren Wright Sr. died on December 28, 1950. His \ncareer may have been best\u0014\n                summarized in the obituary by editor Haden \nKirkpatrick in The Thoroughbred\u0014\n                Record (Vol. 153, No.1, January 6, 1951): \u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"He played the game the way all games should be \nplayed, with a fierce\u0014\n                     devotion to the main objective, content with \nnothing but paramount\u0014\n                     achievement. In a sport that has its integrity \nsometimes questioned, his was\u0014\n                     above the reproach of even the most scurrilous \ncritics. The world knew, and\u0014\n                     there was never a doubt, that when the Calumets \nwent down as they\u0014\n                     sometimes did, they went down leveling with all \nturrets blazing. That element\u0014\n                     of uncompromising endeavor was doubtless Warren \nWright's greatest gift to\u0014\n                     American racing. For the devil red, not merely a \nsymbol of the ultimate\u0014\n                     aristocracy of the turf, became also the proud \nbanner of the $2 bettor. They\u0014\n                     believed in it, and they worshipped the horses \nthat bore it.

    "title": "FEEDING OF THE 5000 7 WALKING ON WATER",
    "words": "Only one miracle made it into all four gospels. It transpired on the\u0014\ngrassy hills by the shores of the Sea of Galilee at a time when Jesus'\u0014\npopularity--and also his vulnerability--was cresting. Wherever he \nwent,\u0014\na throng that included many deranged and afflicted trailed behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day before the big miracle, Jesus crossed the lake to elude the\u0014\nmasses. Herod had just executed John the Baptist, Jesus' relative, his\u0014\nforerunner and friend, and Jesus needed time alone to grieve. \nDoubtless,\u0014\nJohn's death provoked somber thoughts of the fate awaiting him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlas, there would be no secluded retreat. A huge swarm of yesterday's\u0014\nmultitude made the ten-mile journey around the lake and soon hundreds,\u0014\neven thousands of people clamored around Jesus. \"He had compassion on\u0014\nthem,\" says Mark, \"because they were like sheep without a shepherd.\"\u0014\nInstead of spending the day renewing his spirit, Jesus spent it \nhealing\u0014\nthe sick, always an energy drain, and speaking to a crowd large enough\u0014\nto fill a modern basketball arena.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue of food came up. What to do? There are at least five \nthousand\u0014\nmen, not to mention the women and children! Send them away, suggested\u0014\none disciple. Buy them dinner, said Jesus. What? Is he kidding? We're\u0014\ntalking eight months' wages!\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Jesus took command in a way none of them had seen before. Have \nthe\u0014\npeople sit down in groups of fifty, he said. It was like a political\u0014\nrally--festive, orderly, hierarchical--exactly what one might expect\u0014\nfrom a Messiah figure.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnavoidably, we moderns read Jesus' life backwards, knowing how it \nturns\u0014\nout. That day, no one but Jesus had a clue. Murmurs rustled through \nthe\u0014\ngroup on the packed hillside. Is he the one? Could it be? In the\u0014\nwilderness, Satan had dangled before Jesus the prospects of a\u0014\ncrowd-pleasing miracle. Now, not to please a crowd but merely to \nsettle\u0014\ntheir stomachs, Jesus took two salted fish and five small loaves of\u0014\nbread and performed the miracle everyone was waiting for.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree of the Gospels leave it at that. \"They all ate and were \nsatisfied,\u0014\nand the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of \nbread\u0014\nand fish,\" reports Mark with masterful understatement. Only John tells\u0014\nwhat happened next. Jesus got his time alone, at last. As the \ndisciples\u0014\nrowed back across the lake, fighting a storm all the way, Jesus spent\u0014\nthe night on a mount, alone in prayer. Later that night he rejoined \nthem\u0014\nby walking across the water.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Yancey, The Jesus I Never Knew, Zondervan, 1995, 175-176.\u0014",

Later Eleanor would write that the \nbottom fell out of her world. She did what any high-minded wife would \nhave done at the time: She offered her husband his freedom. Guilty, \ngrief-stricken, but besotted by the lovely Miss Mercer, Franklin \naccepted his wife's offer. After six months in Reno, which had \nrecently replaced Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as America's foremost \ndivorce mill, Eleanor, mindful of the shame and potential scandal \nthat stalked a divorce, withdrew to a small safe circle of wellborn \nfriends and relatives. Franklin, dismissed from his position by \nSecretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, who had hounded his own \nbrother-in-law from the family newspaper and the state of North \nCarolina for a similar offense, took the second Mrs. Roosevelt back \nto Hyde Park. He could not, however, return to his beloved \nSpringwood, overlooking the Hudson; his mother, who held the purse \nstrings, had disinherited him, as she'd threatened to do if he \ndisgraced the family with a divorce. He lived out his days in the \ngeneral vicinity, pursuing a series of agricultural and forestry \nexperiments. Fourteen years later a Depression-wracked nation elected \nNewton D. Baker its thirty-second President. In the annals of \ntwentieth-century history, Franklin D. Roosevelt merits a brief \nlisting as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. \nEleanor Roosevelt is not mentioned at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is true, up to a point. Eleanor Roosevelt did offer her \nhusband a divorce, but Franklin declined. He loved Lucy, but he ached \nto be President. It is better to marry than to burn, St. Paul said, \nand opened an alternative path to salvation for those who could not \nembrace celibacy. In Franklin Roosevelt's case, it was better to stay \nmarried than to burn. Everyone knew the American people would not \nelect a divorced man to their highest office.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to believe that a small adjustment between two people or, \nas is frequently the case, among three, can arouse such passions and \nalter the course of history. But the powerful emotions divorce stirs \ngrow out of the primitive lusts it seeks to contain. Divorce is \nsociety's attempt to regulate the urge for sex and the desire for \nproperty. Small wonder that it inflames; less that it is always with \nus.\u0014",

    "words": "Finding Comfort in Eschatalogical Texts?\u0014\nChristian Hope in Revelation\u0014\nBrian Lee\u0014\n1999, 2000 Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes your eschatology provide you with Christian comfort? One of the \ntragic effects of dispensationalism on American Christianity has been \na speculative spirit with regard to the last things. While the New \nTestament authors recognized that they were living in the last days \nand that the consummation of history had already begun in the cross \nof Christ, dispensationalism has sought that consummation elsewhere. \nIt has looked almost completely to the future and away from the \ncross. The Apostles saw themselves in the midst of a present \neschatological drama, but dispen-sationalism has sought apocalyptic \ndrama outside the text of the New Testament, ever around the next \nhistorical corner. The clarity and comfort of New Testament \neschatology has been transformed into confusion and fear by a \nspeculative hermeneutic which insists on reading the text in our \ncontext, instead of its own.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe net result is a Christian story of \"Armageddon\" as pagan as last \nsummer's big screen hit, with the impending return of Christ about as \ncomforting and meaningful as a meteorite hurtling toward earth. \nIndeed, the terror of the panicked crowds in that film recall my \nterror as a youth, watching a Christian film dramatizing the \n\"rapture.\" Would I make it or not? Even if I did, what about my \nfamily and friends?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is however an alternative. From Genesis to Revelation \neschatology is portrayed as the consummate fulfillment of God's \npromises in history, with the New Testament emphasizing that the \ncentral promise has already been fulfilled in the death and \nresurrection of Christ. Therefore, eschatology is not distinct from, \nbut thoroughly involved with God's Gospel promise to save. The \"Good \nNews\" is eschatological news: \"The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom \nof God is at hand; repent and believe in the Gospel\" (Mark 1:15). \nThere can be no Gospel without eschatology, and there can be no \neschatology without Gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen these central truths are understood, the manner in which the \nChurch reads and preaches the explicitly eschatological texts of the \nNew Testament is radically transformed. We no longer allow ourselves \nto be confused by the questions these texts raise.1 Rather, we are \ncomforted by the certainties they hold forth. This transformation can \nbe illustrated by the following reading of Revelation 7. It will show \nthat the Apostle John, rather than providing a road map for future \nspeculation, is comforting the people of God by portraying the \ncertain, present reality enjoyed by the Church, both on earth and in \nheaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Divine Presence Revealed\u0014\nRevelation 7 serves as an interlude, of sorts. In chapters 4 and 5, \nJohn is brought up into the divine council-chamber, where he \ndescribes its chief and central glory: the slain Lamb. Because the \nLamb was slain, he alone is worthy to break the seals on the scroll, \nwhich in chapter 6 unleashes the consummation of his glory. There we \nsee that the rider of the white horse has gone out \"conquering, and \nto conquer\" (6:2), and the other horsemen have likewise gone forth \nbringing war, famine, pestilence, and death. Between seals six and \nseven is the vision of Revelation 7, comprising both the sealing of \nthe 144,000 and the image of the great multitude before the throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe immediate backdrop of this interlude is the sixth seal, which \nunleashes the cataclysmic overturning of the natural order, usually \nassociated in Scripture with the Day of the Lord: \"and there was a \ngreat earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, \nand the whole moon became like blood  and every mountain and island \nwere moved out of their place\" (Rev. 6:12-14; cf. Is. 13:10, 50:3; \nZech. 14:3-8). This is no mere natural disaster. This is the \nrevelation of the righteous judgment of God, as even the unbelieving \nkings of the earth discern. \"Fall on us and hide us from the presence \nof him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb\" \n(6:16). The theophanic glory of the throne room reality in chapters 4 \nand 5 begins to intrude on the created order below. Judgment and \nwrath, long delayed, are now poured out.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is understandable how an eschatology of fear could arise from such \na text! The Day of the Lord rightly holds nothing but terror for \nmany. But we err greatly if we fail to understand that those \nterrified are unbelievers. Further, the text clearly states that even \nthey know the source of their terror--the divine presence and the \nLamb's wrath. The following interlude directly addresses how the \nChurch is comforted--not terrified!--by the appearance of the living \nGod. It answers the rhetorical question, \"And who is able to stand?\" \nThe Church's comfort has always been secured by the turning away of \nthe Lamb's wrath; her blessing has always been expressed by the \ndwelling of the divine presence in her midst; and her hope has always \nbeen the final judgment of her enemies (Rom. 5:9, Ex. 33:15-16, \nPsalms 2 and 7).\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Wrath for the 144,000\u0014\nThe first image in chapter 7 shows four angels holding back the four \nwinds so that nothing on the earth can be harmed. A fifth angel \nrising from the east has the seal of the living God, and cries out to \nthe other four, \"Do not harm the earth  until we have sealed the \nbond-servants of our God on their foreheads.\" This angel proceeds to \nnumber the 144,000 sealed bond-servants: twelve thousand from each of \nthe twelve tribes of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnter speculation. One popular reading of this text is that the \n144,000 refers to a literal group of ethnic Jews, distinct from the \nChurch and distinct from the \"great multitude\" that follows in verses \n9-17.2 This surely seems to be warranted by their description as \n\"sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel,\" not to mention the \nclear listing of each and every tribe by name. But, since scriptural \nauthors often describe the Church using Old Testament language for \nIsrael (Rom. 9:24-26; 11:5, I Pet. 2:9-10, Rev. 1:6), it is not \nenough simply to point to the word \"Israel\" in the text. One must \nunderstand in what sense \"Israel\" is used.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis task becomes somewhat easier because we meet up with 144,000 \nbond-servants once again in chapter 14. This time they are standing \nwith the Lamb on Mount Zion and have \"His name and the name of His \nFather written on their foreheads\" (14:1). Unless John is seeking to \nconfuse us, it is not likely that this is a different 144,000! On the \ncontrary, the link is intentional. John includes details to remind us \nof their prior appearance, in order to expand information about them. \nIn this chapter we learn that the 144,000 alone are able to sing the \nnew song before the throne, because they have been purchased from the \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis information alone should convince us that the 144,000 are not a \ngroup of ethnic Jews distinct from the Church. They are linked \nuniversally and exclusively to the atonement. Moreover, chapter 14 \nfurther connects the 144,000 with at least three different \ndescriptions of the Church in Revelation: 1) Rev. 5:9 where we are \ntold the Lamb purchased people \"from every tribe and tongue and \npeople and nation\"; 2) The great multitude in 7:9-17 which is \nlikewise drawn \"from every nation and tribe and people and tongue\" \nand is worshiping before the throne of God and the Lamb; and 3) Rev. \n22:3 where \"His bond-servants\" (indisputably the universal Church in \nglory) worship before the throne of God and the Lamb, having his name \non their foreheads. Given the relevant data, it is clear that the \nApostle is describing the Church itself as the New Israel, the \nfulfillment of Old Testament typology. This is literally what John \ntells us!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does John employ this particular image here? The image is one of \ncensus-taking, reminiscent of the numbering of Israel in the \nwilderness. In Numbers 1, the Lord commands Moses to take a census of \n\"all the congregation of the sons of Israel,\" counting every male \nfrom twenty years old and upward who is able to go out to war in \nIsrael. The tribes were then numbered \"by their armies,\" and in \nchapter 2 we are told where each numbered army camped under their own \nstandard: north, south, east, and west, \"around the tent of meeting \nat a distance.\" Revelation 7 thus presents a picture of the whole \ncongregation of the Lord, arrayed in military style and prepared for \nbattle.\u0014\n\u0014\nCentral to the account in Numbers 1-2 is the role of the Levites, who \nare not counted among the Lord's armies, but who rather are appointed \n\"over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, \nand over all that belongs to it\" (Num. 1:50).3 As such, they are not \na part of the Army of the Lord, but their ministry serves another, \nmore important, function. \"But the Levites shall camp around the \ntabernacle of the testimony, that there may be no wrath on the \ncongregation of the sons of Israel\" (Num. 1:53). Israel was not to \nfear the divine presence in their midst, or the wrath of God, as long \nas the Levites interposed the blood of goats and bulls on their \nbehalf.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, in Revelation 7 John is not informing his readers of some \nfuture Jewish converts-- note the indeterminate, speculative, and \nfuture referent this implies. Rather, he is describing the Church \nitself, his very audience. He is comforting them in the midst of \npresent and coming judgment. Not only is the New Israel protected \nfrom the wrath of God by the blood of the Eschatological Lamb (5:9), \nthey themselves have become a means of carrying out judgment as a \nholy army. Just as the armies of Israel carried out God's judgment on \napostate Canaan of old, so the final judgment will be wrought through \nthe faithful testimony and martyrdom of the Church militant. The \nfaithful have nothing to fear; rather it is their ministry of Word \nand Sacrament that strikes fear in the hearts of unbelievers.4\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Multitude\u0014\nNext John sees a \"great multitude from every nation and tribe and \npeople and tongue.\" But palm branches and white robes have replaced \nthe military array of verses 1-8. The angels and servants of the Lord \nare no longer carrying out the Lord's military will on the earth, but \nare worshiping before the heavenly throne. Indeed, an elder tells \nJohn distinctly that those in the white robes have been transported \nout of the conflagration below:\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they \nhave washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. \nFor this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve \nHim day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne shall \nspread His tabernacle over them (7:14-15).\u0014\nThis multitude is an image of the universal Church in glory, \nrepresenting the same people who were purchased by the blood of the \nLamb \"from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.\" Also, the \ncontent of the worship around the throne bears many of the same \nelements of that in chapters 4 and 5, as well as parallels in many \nother places in Revelation.5\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we conclude that both the 144,000 and the great multitude \nrepresent the Church, we must explain John's many stark contrasts: \nthe numbered 144,000 vs. the innu-merable multitude; the twelve \ntribes vs. all tribes; and a terrestrial vs. a heavenly setting. The \nanswer lies in the common origin of the imagery in the whole chapter: \nIsrael's histor-ical exodus from Egypt, wilderness wandering, and \nultimate conquest of the Promised Land. For John, Israel's history \nforeshadows the Church's eschatological reality. The Church's \nexperience now can be explained and understood as the fulfillment of \nIsrael's sacred history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, the great multitude are those who have \"come out of the great \ntribulation,\" which is the same language used by the Greek Old \nTestament to describe Israel in Exodus 3:17. Also, the garment \nwashing (7:14) reminds us of the Lord's command that Israel wash \ntheir robes before meeting him at Sinai (Ex. 19:10-14). The \nwilderness tabernacle has now become the temple. Instead of camping \naround the tent of meeting, he who sits on the throne spreads his \ntabernacle over them all (7:15)! The blessings of the redeemed are \ndescribed in the same language that Isaiah (49:10) used to describe \nthe wilderness provision of the Lord: \"They shall hunger no more, \nneither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun beat down on them, nor \nany heat; for the Lamb in the center of the throne shall be their \nshepherd, and shall guide them to springs of the water of life\" (Rev. \n7:17).\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, as 7:1-8 depicts the army of the Lord marching through the \nwilderness to enter the Promised Land, 7:9-17 portrays the Exodus \nfulfillment of the entry into the eternal rest of the Promised Land \ninheritance (Heb. 4). The divine presence (literally, \"face\"), from \nwhich the kings of the earth hide, has become the eternal blessed \nvision of the children of God, \"And they shall see His face\" (Rev. \n22:4). Throughout, the Lamb is the focus of this account of the \nChurch in glory. It is him whom they worship, it is his blood which \nhas washed their robes clean, and he is the Shepherd who guides them \nto springs of living water. His blood is for them; his wrath is not. \nTherefore, his coming brings them no terror, only great joy.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch Militant, Church Triumphant\u0014\nDoes your eschatology provide you with Christian comfort? If it does \nnot, then it is not the eschatology of the New Testament. For in the \nNew Testament we find ourselves in the text, sealed unto eternal life \nby the blood of the Lamb. We are the Army of the Lord, the New \nIsrael, protected from the blasts of all tribulation by the power of \nthe living God. Though we may suffer as martyrs, the first death \nholds no terror, only added glory. We do not fear the present \nrevelation of the righteous judgment of God, rather we recognize its \nrevelation in our midst through Word and Sacrament, and eagerly \nanticipate its consummation. This is the blessed comfort of the \nChurch Militant, the saints on earth awaiting the return of their \nLord and Savior, when they will finally be vindicated for all the \nworld to see.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the vision of the Church Triumphant, gathered about the throne \nin worship, is not a foreign reality to us. For though the last enemy \nhas not yet been abolished, Paul tells us that we are already seated \nin the heavenlies with Christ (Eph. 2:6). Because we already have \nbeen washed with the blood of the Lamb, we know that we will soon be \nbefore the throne of God, as those who have gone before us presently \nare. Indeed, the first-fruits of this blessing have appeared in the \nrisen Christ. We have a foretaste of the bounty of the marriage feast \nof the Lamb every time we receive communion. Even our future \nblessings are a present comfort!\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation 7 is typical of New Testament eschatology, basing our \nfuture comfort squarely upon the completed work of the slain Lamb. \n\"Having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the \nwrath of God through Him\" (Rom. 5:9). With the Psalmist and with our \nconfessions, we eagerly await the final judgment of God: \"Arise, O \nLord, in Thine anger. Lift up Thyself against the rage of my \nadversaries, and arouse Thyself for me; Thou has appointed judgment\" \n(Psalm 7:2).\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, with good reason the thought of this judgment is horrible \nand dreadful to wicked and evil people. But it is very pleasant and a \ngreat comfort to the righteous and elect, since their total \nredemption will then be accomplished. They will then receive the \nfruits of their labor and of the trouble they have suffered; their \ninnocence will be openly recognized by all; and they will see the \nterrible vengeance that God will bring on the evil ones who \ntyrannized, oppressed, and tormented them in this world (Belgic \nConfession, Article XXXVII).\u0014\nMr. Brian Lee (M.A.R., Westminster Theological Seminary in \nCalifornia) is a Ph.D. candidate in historical theology at Calvin \nTheological Seminary and the editor of the new column \"Preaching \nChrist\" in MR.\u0014",

    "words": "Fisher's Of Men, Witnessing\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of our witnessing is likely to happen in passing moments of\u0014\nconversation--those occasions when we show, in relatively minor ways, \nwho we\u0014\nare and to whom we belong. I think of a suburban woman who was playing\u0014\ntennis with her good but quite secular friends. In a conversation \nbreak\u0014\nbetween sets she began referring to something she had read that \nmorning. It\u0014\nwould have been easy to say, \"I read something this morning .\" \nInstead, with\u0014\nno attempt at piosity, she simply introduced one word: \"In my \ndevotional\u0014\nreading this morning.\" It was not a major soul-winning engagement. It \nwas,\u0014\nhowever, a true sowing of seed. By a word, she had opened the door \nfor some\u0014\nfurther conversation.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps our greatest problem in becoming Christs fishermen is that \nwe are\u0014\nnot enough in earnest to grasp the opportunities that come to us; or \nwe are\u0014\nso possessed of the idea that we must say something dramatic and\u0014\nfar-reaching that we fail to say the small, immediate and potentially\u0014\nsignificant thing. To put it in the language of our lesson for the \nday, most\u0014\nof us really dont act as if we even have a call to \"fish.\" Were out \nin the\u0014\nwaters of human need every day, but we dont seem to know it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issue is not that we should become more aggressive about sharing \nour\u0014\nfaith. It is that we should be more sensitive to the needs of the \nworld\u0014\naround us, and more sensitive to the subtle prodding of the Holy \nSpirit. The\u0014\ntwo sensitivities are wonderfully intertwined. To be sensitive to the \nHoly\u0014\nSpirit must mean that we will be more sensitive to people and their \npain; to\u0014\nbe more sensitive to people ought to make us more open to God and his\u0014\npurposes.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.

Christopher Shays,\u0014\n                          R-Conn.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Rich's former wife, Denise Rich, refused to \nanswer questions sent to her\u0014\n                          by the committee. ``Ms. Rich is asserting \nher privilege under the Fifth\u0014\n                          Amendment of the U.S. Constitution not to \nbe a witness against herself,''\u0014\n                          her attorney, Carol Bruce, said in a letter \nto the panel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          The lawyer also told the committee Ms. Rich \nhad given an ``enormous\u0014\n                          sum of money'' to the Clinton Presidential \nLibrary Fund, said Burton,\u0014\n                          R-Ind.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Burton later said the committee would like \ngo to the Justice Department\u0014\n                          and ask for a grant of immunity for Ms. \nRich so she might be compelled to\u0014\n                          testify.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Weinberg and Martin Auerbach, two lifelong \nDemocrats who worked on\u0014\n                          convicting Rich and his partner Pincus \nGreen and now vehemently oppose\u0014\n                          his pardon, told the committee that for \nyears they were always consulted\u0014\n                          about Rich's case as it proceeded through \nthe court system.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          In the end, he said, Clinton ``relied \nexclusively on the presentation of Mr.\u0014\n                          Rich and Mr. Green's counsel ... which in \nour opinion completely\u0014\n                          mischaracterizes the circumstances and \nfacts.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Green also was pardoned on Jan. 20.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Quinn contended that Rich deserved the \npardon because of flawed\u0014\n                          prosecution.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was \nU.S. attorney in 1983, along\u0014\n                          with Auerbach and Weinberg misused the \nRacketeer Influenced and\u0014\n                          Corrupt Organization Act to indict Rich, \nQuinn said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Rich was one of the first RICO targets that \ndid not involve organized crime,\u0014\n                          and the Justice Department has since banned \nthe use of RICO in cases\u0014\n                          like Rich's, Quinn said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          ``I was convinced that Mr. Giuliani, Mr. \nWeinberg, Mr. Auerbach and their\u0014\n                          colleagues had constructed a legal house of \ncards,'' Quinn said. ``It was a\u0014\n                          misuse of RICO on top of misuse of RICO \npredicates and underlying it all,\u0014\n                          a tax and energy case with no merit. The \ncase was flawed.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Weinberg and Auerbach said if the \ngovernment didn't have a case, Rich\u0014\n                          and Green wouldn't have fled the country \nand renounced their citizenship.\u0014\n                          If their case against Rich and Green was a \nhouse of cards, ``it was all\u0014\n                          aces,'' Auerbach added.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          The pardon of Rich has been criticized by \nsome congressional Democrats\u0014\n                          as well. Rep. Henry Waxman of California, \nsenior Democrat on the\u0014\n                          committee, called the pardon ``an end run \naround the judicial process.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                          ``But under the current system, the \npresident is allowed to make bad\u0014\n                          judgment,'' he said. ``I see no evidence of \ncriminal wrongdoing that has\u0014\n                          been presented to us.''\u0014",

He was\u0014\n                    91. Imprisoned by communist authorities in his \nnative Romania for 14 years --\u0014\n                    spending almost three of them in solitary \nconfinement -- Wurmbrand wrote about\u0014\n                    his experiences in the best-selling \"Tortured for \nChrist.\" He and his wife, Sabina,\u0014\n                    were allowed to leave Romania for a new life in \nthe West in the mid-1960s, when\u0014\n                    they founded Voice of the Martyrs (VM).

Both born into Jewish families, the \nWurmbrands became Christians\u0014\n                    shortly after their marriage in 1936. They became \nleaders of the Romanian\u0014\n                    church during World War II, risking their lives \nto smuggle Jewish children out of\u0014\n                    the ghettos. Wurmbrand was arrested by the \ncommunists in 1948. His wife also\u0014\n                    was jailed for three years. Wurmbrand traveled \nwidely speaking for VM.

In his\u0014\n                      book Eyewitness to Power, he reported that the \nexposure of\u0014\n                      Clinton's infidelity damaged his conjugal bonds \nand so\u0014\n                      depressed him that he and the first lady were \nunable to work\u0014\n                      together on domestic policies. In addition, \nHillary Clinton\u0014\n                      decided to run for the Senate at the same time. \nNo relation\u0014\n                      between private and public?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Furthermore, the \"character issue\"the weight \nof one's word\u0014\n                      when a finger is wagged or public testimony \ngiven, how one\u0014\n                      treats another human being, one's faithfulness \nto vows taken\u0014\n                      before bar or altar, and sexual \nresponsibilitymarked both\u0014\n                      Democratic and Republican campaigns this fall. \nIn selecting\u0014\n                      Joseph Lieberman, a high-profile critic of \nClinton's behavior,\u0014\n                      my own Democratic Party acknowledged that deep \ndown in\u0014\n                      the soul of the American electorate the \npersonal is\u0014\n                      inseparable from the political.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And while policy questions were given priority, \nsurely the\u0014\n                      issue of character was a subtext in the Bush \ncampaign. As\u0014\n                      presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin has \nsaid on\u0014\n                      television, the Clinton scandals gave Bush the \ncharacter\u0014\n                      issue, significantly influencing the voters.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One part of Clinton's legacy is that we will \nscrutinize his\u0014\n                      successors to make sure there is coherence \nbetween\u0014\n                      personal behavior and public professions of \npiety and virtue.\u0014\n                      Prediction: Future presidents will be held \naccountable\u0014\n                      because women reporters and a newly voiced \nfemale citizenry\u0014\n                      will no longer let male sexual adventurism pass.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In an ironic twist, the \"separatists\"who \ninsisted that\u0014\n                      government had no business mixing the personal \nwith the\u0014\n                      politicalcampaigned to pass a congressional \nresolution\u0014\n                      declaring Clinton's personal conduct \nreprehensible. Of course,\u0014\n                      the congressional rebuke functioned partly as a \nploy to show\u0014\n                      moral outrage while deflecting impeachment. But \nit was also\u0014\n                      an admission that the faithful execution of \npublic office\u0014\n                      requires the personal virtues of \ntrustworthiness, truth-telling,\u0014\n                      and fidelity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. Understand two \"conversations.\" How often we \nsaw\u0014\n                      President Clinton proceeding from church with \nBible in hand.\u0014\n                      How pious were his prayer breakfasts, visits to \ncongregations,\u0014\n                      and consultations with clergy. Sooner or later, \nhe had to\u0014\n                      account for disparities between his professions \nof piety and\u0014\n                      his practice.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two conversations go on with presidents about \nmatters of\u0014\n                      personal morality. The first conversation has \nto do with the\u0014\n                      public's need for moral standards in public \noffice, based on\u0014\n                      data everyone can inspect in accord with \nuniversally\u0014\n                      discernible norms. Being caught in lies and \ninfidelity weakens\u0014\n                      a presidency. When the public was having this \nconversation\u0014\n                      with Clinton, it escalated into congressional \nscrutiny of his\u0014\n                      \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christians conduct a second conversation with a \npresident\u0014\n                      who professes to be a believer. This \nconversation draws upon\u0014\n                      biblical teachings to which both parties give \nallegiance, such\u0014\n                      as matters of repentance and forgiveness, the \ngrace of God,\u0014\n                      Christian vocation and its responsibilities, \nthe temptations\u0014\n                      that come with power, and the like.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unfortunately, the nation confused these two \nconversations\u0014\n                      during the presidential crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Defenders of Clinton declared the critique that \ncame from\u0014\n                      religious quarters to be a dangerous \nneopuritanism. But the\u0014\n                      theological call for accountability is part of \nthe second\u0014\n                      conversationthe back-and-forth among professed \nChristians\u0014\n                      about shared moral commitments. Such dialogue \nmight well\u0014\n                      include a call for resignation as a sign of \nmaking amends for\u0014\n                      dishonoring one's stewardship of the highest \noffice in the land.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      However, Christian-specific charges in \nthemselves do not\u0014\n                      constitute warrants for impeachment. Some \ncritics of Clinton\u0014\n                      gave ammunition to his defenders as they \ndeployed Christian\u0014\n                      premises as criteria for removal from office. \nYet another\u0014\n                      aspect of the Clinton legacy is that we must \ndistinguish\u0014\n                      between the two encounters in the public \nsquare, because\u0014\n                      they have different venues, criteria, and \nconsequences.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      3. Walk the walk, talk the talk. The \nPresident's prayer\u0014\n                      breakfast testimony, a letter to his Southern \nBaptist\u0014\n                      congregation, his remarks before \nAfrican-American churches,\u0014\n                      his counseling relationship with clergyPhilip \nWogaman,\u0014\n                      Jessie Jackson, Tony Campolo, and Gordon\u0014\n                      MacDonaldand most recently his chat with Bill \nHybels at a\u0014\n                      Willow Creek Church leadership conference place \nthe\u0014\n                      question of repentance squarely before us.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Christianity, repentance shows up in two \nplaces: in\u0014\n                      conversion, as it springs from saving faith, \nand later in the\u0014\n                      Christian, as part of a sanctification, a \nre-turning, ever and\u0014\n                      again, from the sin that persists in the life \nof the redeemed, all\u0014\n                      by grace alone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What are the elements of such repentance? The\u0014\n                      Reformation's Second Helvetic Confession puts \nit this way:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           By repentance we understand (1) the \nrecovery\u0014\n                           of a right mind in a sinful person \nawakened by\u0014\n                           the Word of the Gospel and the Holy \nSpirit, and\u0014\n                           received by true faith, by which the sinner\u0014\n                           immediately acknowledges his innate \ncorruption\u0014\n                           and all his sins accused by the Word of \nGod;\u0014\n                           and (2) grieves for them from the heart, \nand not\u0014\n                           only bewails and frankly confesses them \nbefore\u0014\n                           God with a feeling of shame; but also (3) \nwith\u0014\n                           indignation abominates them; and (4) now\u0014\n                           zealously considers the amendment of his\u0014\n                           ways and constantly strives for innocence \nand\u0014\n                           virtue in which conscientiously to exercise\u0014\n                           himself all the rest of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is tough talk. Repentance, so described, \nis an inner and\u0014\n                      outer about-face, the Greek metanoia: a change \nof mind and\u0014\n                      heart, mouth, hands, and feet. An assurance of \npardon in\u0014\n                      response to a \"general confession of sin\" of \nthe kind used in\u0014\n                      many Protestant Sunday services strikes the \nsame notes.\u0014\n                      Pardon is, as my Evangelical and Reformed \nhymnal puts it,\u0014\n                      assured \"unto as many of you, beloved, as truly \nrepent of\u0014\n                      your sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ \nwith full\u0014\n                      purpose of new obedience.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The discussion of these matters by Christians \nduring the\u0014\n                      Clinton crisis had to do with the meaning of \nrepentance in the\u0014\n                      Christian life, especially with \"walking the \nwalk as well as\u0014\n                      talking the talk.\" Such a conversation will go \non with any\u0014\n                      president who professes the Christian faith. \nThat is why 200\u0014\n                      teachers of religion and ethics who issued \"A \nDeclaration\u0014\n                      Concerning Religion, Ethics, and the Crisis in \nthe Clinton\u0014\n                      Presidency\" in 1998 questioned Clinton's \n\"incomplete\u0014\n                      repentance,\" asserting the need for amendment \nproportionate\u0014\n                      to sins confessed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      4. Affirm grace, both free and costly. But what \nof the sheer\u0014\n                      grace of God? Does God withhold mercy when \nrepentance is\u0014\n                      incomplete? Another lesson from the Clinton \nlegacy is that\u0014\n                      we need to struggle with the question of how \nGod's mercy\u0014\n                      comes to the sinner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Our Lord's parable of the Prodigal Son \nilluminates Clinton's\u0014\n                      attempt at repentance. Did the father welcome \nthe errant\u0014\n                      home because he knew his son returned penitent? \nNot\u0014\n                      according to the account in Scripture. The \nprodigal was \"yet\u0014\n                      afar off\" when the father ran to embrace him. \nThe parent had\u0014\n                      no knowledge of the son's reasons for return \n(could it be\u0014\n                      another plea for patrimony?), yet he put out \nthe welcome mat.\u0014\n                      God's unmerited, unconditional grace anxiously \nawaits\u0014\n                      sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What did it take for the Semitic parent, \nrighteously wrathful\u0014\n                      over the son's wasted substance, to make that \nmove? Surely\u0014\n                      it took a heart that accepted the judgment \ndeserved by the\u0014\n                      son into itself, a portent of God's suffering \nlove on the cross.\u0014\n                      Divine forgiveness awaits the sinners because \nof Christ's\u0014\n                      sacrifice, not because of their good works such \nas acts of\u0014\n                      penitence. Grace is free!\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But it is not cheap, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer \npointed out in The\u0014\n                      Cost of Discipleship. Grace is there for the \ntaking, but you\u0014\n                      must receive it firsthand. Faith enabled the \nprodigal's reach for\u0014\n                      the grace-filled arms of the father. And the \nprodigal had to\u0014\n                      make that metanoia from old demons to get on \nthe road\u0014\n                      home, an about-face possible only by grace. A \ncostly\u0014\n                      repentance is not yet faith, but is \ninextricable from it.\u0014\n                      Paradoxically, grace costs nothing but it is \npriceless.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Did we forgive the prodigal? The plea of the \npious as well as\u0014\n                      many politicians was the same during the \ncrisis: \"The\u0014\n                      President has repented. What more do you want?\" \nA fair\u0014\n                      question. Do we have the right to withhold our \nforgiveness and\u0014\n                      show less charity than Jesus Christ? Our mercy \nmust run in\u0014\n                      welcome like the proverbial earthly father and \nreach like the\u0014\n                      heavenly Father. Christian forgiveness comes \nwithout\u0014\n                      conditions, even before the word or deed of \nrepentance. Bill\u0014\n                      Clinton does not need to earn his salvation by \ngood works,\u0014\n                      including the words and deeds of repentance, \nany more than\u0014\n                      we do.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet, like the prodigal, he must make a turn \ntoward home to\u0014\n                      receive the proffered forgiveness. Grace is \nfree but not cheap.\u0014\n                      It is not ours to withhold forgiveness from the \nPresident. It is\u0014\n                      his to decide to accept it in the heart, with \nthe mouth, and by\u0014\n                      the feet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Christian conversation has implications for \nthe public\u0014\n                      conversation here. For Christians, the Clinton \nlegacy teaches\u0014\n                      another facet of the \"distinguishable but not \nseparable\" refrain\u0014\n                      in matters of morals, politics, and piety. In \nher comments on\u0014\n                      forgiveness during the crisis, political \nphilosopher and\u0014\n                      theologian Jean Bethke Elshtain observed that \nPope John\u0014\n                      Paul II forgave his would-be assassin, but he \ndid not plead for\u0014\n                      removal of the assailant's jail term. In the \nsame vein, a Boston\u0014\n                      pastor noted that Jesus forgave the thief on \nthe cross but did\u0014\n                      not rescue him from his civil penalty. Both \ncomments\u0014\n                      recognize the distinction Christians must make \nbetween the\u0014\n                      gospel and law, the forgiveness freely given by \nthe grace of\u0014\n                      God and the accountability required by the \nnorms of the\u0014\n                      state.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      5. Beware the hand of Jehu\u0014\n\u0014\n                           As Jehu drives his chariot through the \nPlain of\u0014\n                           Jezreel toward Samaria to kill the \nremaining\u0014\n                           members of the royal family, he invites the\u0014\n                           prophet Jehonadab to ride along: \"Come with\u0014\n                           me and see my zeal for the Lord.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So observed biblical scholar Robert Jewett in \nJudgment Day\u0014\n                      at the White House, citing 2 Kings 10:16. He \nwas drawing an\u0014\n                      analogy between the temptations of Jehonadab \nand the\u0014\n                      conduct of some clergy during the Clinton \ncrisis.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The hand of Jehu is ever extended. Ah, to ride \nin the chariots\u0014\n                      of the mighty! The ready absolution given to \nClinton by some\u0014\n                      religious leaders in response to his words of \ncontrition made\u0014\n                      me think of the seduction of proximity to \npower. Among\u0014\n                      others, Clinton got endorsements from Christian \nCentury\u0014\n                      editorials as well as from prominent \nevangelicals. And what\u0014\n                      do we make of Bill Hybels's recent hosting of a \nClinton\u0014\n                      apologia in the country's best-known \nmegachurch? Six\u0014\n                      hundred members of that congregation gathered \nsoon after to\u0014\n                      ask their pastor that question.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Was Clinton's apparent contrition just the \nWhite House way\u0014\n                      of seeking to refute the President's critics? \nReligious leaders\u0014\n                      need to learn something about the \"gee whiz\" \nfactor. To be on\u0014\n                      the list of invitees to the White House, to get \na phone call\u0014\n                      from the President, to have him sit in one of \nyour pewsis\u0014\n                      this a hand up into the chariot? God help us if \nwe give\u0014\n                      evidence for the Marxist charge that religion \nexists to provide\u0014\n                      cover for the powers that be.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course presidents need pastoral care. Clergy \nshould\u0014\n                      attend them, even with the temptations that \ncome at the\u0014\n                      highest level of power. How to relate \npastorally to those at the\u0014\n                      pinnacle but not capitulate politically to \ntheir agenda? The art\u0014\n                      of living in such tension doesn't come easy. In \ndoing so, the\u0014\n                      ministers should remember the companion story \nto Jehu and\u0014\n                      Jehonadab, that of Nathan's response to the \nexecrable\u0014\n                      actions of David. Not only must the prophet \nrefuse to ride with\u0014\n                      the king; he must be ready to stand before that \nking and say\u0014\n                      firmly and publicly, \"You are the man!\" (2 \nSamuel 12:7).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Presidents hunger for a legacy that will shape \ngenerations to\u0014\n                      come. That legacy may include lessons taught by \nuntoward\u0014\n                      circumstances and unsought recollections. Time \nwill tell if\u0014\n                      both our nation and the church learned well \nfrom this season\u0014\n                      of soul-searching.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Gabriel Fackre is a research scholar at the \nCenter of\u0014\n                      Theological Inquiry in Princeton.

    "words": "Five Things Clinton Taught Us\u0014\n                      However future historians judge him, the\u0014\n                      Presidentinadvertentlyleft the church a\u0014\nsignificant legacy.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      By Gabriel Fackre | posted 1/19/01\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Let the president alone!\" declared President\u0014\nClinton's defenders in the midst of Monicagate. \"Judge him\u0014\nby political standards, not personal ones. The private and the\u0014\npublic are separate spheres. Mind your own business, you\u0014\nsexual McCarthyists!\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Many Americans, of course, disagreed as they\u0014\npartook in this national conversation. The President's impeachment\u0014\nforced us to grapple with the complicated mix of morality,\u0014\ngovernance, and faith. Whatever the overall legacy of Bill\u0014\nClinton, this piece of it holds lessons for the nation but\u0014\nespecially for the church.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      1. Reject the separation of personal and public.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While 1999 polls seemed to affirm that \nClinton's sexual\u0014\nescapades  were his own business, the year 2000 was less\u0014\ncharitable.  \"Clinton fatigue\" set in. Memories of his\u0014\ninfidelity and duplicity kept hobbling his attempts to \"move on,\" \nseriously\u0014\nimpeding the President's political effectiveness. Former\u0014\npresidential adviser David Gergen gave us a behind-the-scenes\u0014\nglimpse of how the personal was beginning to take a political\u0014\ntoll. In his book Eyewitness to Power, he reported that the\u0014\nexposure of Clinton's infidelity damaged his conjugal bonds\u0014\nand so depressed him that he and the first lady were\u0014\nunable to work together on domestic policies. In addition,\u0014\nHillary Clinton decided to run for the Senate at the same time. No\u0014\nrelation between private and public?\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Furthermore, the \"character issue\"the weight of\u0014\none's word when a finger is wagged or public testimony given,\u0014\nhow one treats another human being, one's faithfulness to\u0014\nvows taken before bar or altar, and sexual\u0014\nresponsibilitymarked both Democratic and Republican campaigns this \nfall. In\u0014\nselecting Joseph Lieberman, a high-profile critic of\u0014\nClinton's behavior, my own Democratic Party acknowledged that deep\u0014\ndown in the soul of the American electorate the personal\u0014\nis inseparable from the political.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      And while policy questions were given priority,\u0014\nsurely the issue of character was a subtext in the Bush\u0014\ncampaign. As presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin has\u0014\nsaid on television, the Clinton scandals gave Bush the\u0014\ncharacter issue, significantly influencing the voters.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      One part of Clinton's legacy is that we will\u0014\nscrutinize his successors to make sure there is coherence between\u0014\n personal behavior and public professions of piety and virtue.\u0014\n                  Prediction: Future presidents will be held\u0014\naccountable because women reporters and a newly voiced female\u0014\ncitizenry will no longer let male sexual adventurism pass.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      In an ironic twist, the \"separatists\"who \ninsisted\u0014\nthat government had no business mixing the personal\u0014\nwith the politicalcampaigned to pass a congressional\u0014\nresolution declaring Clinton's personal conduct\u0014\nreprehensible. Of course, the congressional rebuke functioned partly \nas a\u0014\nploy to show moral outrage while deflecting impeachment. But it\u0014\nwas also an admission that the faithful execution of public\u0014\noffice requires the personal virtues of trustworthiness,\u0014\ntruth-telling, and fidelity.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      2. Understand two \"conversations.\" \u0014\nHow often we saw President Clinton proceeding from church with\u0014\nBible in hand.  How pious were his prayer breakfasts, visits to\u0014\ncongregations, and consultations with clergy. Sooner or later, he\u0014\nhad to account for disparities between his professions of\u0014\npiety and his practice.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Two conversations go on with presidents about\u0014\nmatters of personal morality. The first conversation has to\u0014\ndo with the public's need for moral standards in public\u0014\noffice, based on data everyone can inspect in accord with\u0014\nuniversally discernible norms. Being caught in lies and\u0014\ninfidelity weakens a presidency. When the public was having this\u0014\nconversation with Clinton, it escalated into congressional\u0014\nscrutiny of his  \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Christians conduct a second conversation with a\u0014\npresident  who professes to be a believer. This conversation\u0014\ndraws upon biblical teachings to which both parties give\u0014\nallegiance, such as matters of repentance and forgiveness, the\u0014\ngrace of God, Christian vocation and its responsibilities, the\u0014\ntemptations that come with power, and the like.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Unfortunately, the nation confused these two\u0014\nconversations during the presidential crisis.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Defenders of Clinton declared the critique that\u0014\ncame from religious quarters to be a dangerous\u0014\nneopuritanism. But the  theological call for accountability is part \nof the\u0014\nsecond conversationthe back-and-forth among professed\u0014\nChristians about shared moral commitments. Such dialogue\u0014\nmight well include a call for resignation as a sign of making\u0014\namends for dishonoring one's stewardship of the highest\u0014\noffice in the land.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      However, Christian-specific charges in \nthemselves\u0014\ndo not\u0014\n                      constitute warrants for impeachment. Some \ncritics\u0014\nof Clinton\u0014\n                      gave ammunition to his defenders as they \ndeployed\u0014\nChristian\u0014\n                      premises as criteria for removal from office. \nYet\u0014\nanother\u0014\n                      aspect of the Clinton legacy is that we must\u0014\ndistinguish\u0014\n                      between the two encounters in the public square,\u0014\nbecause\u0014\n                      they have different venues, criteria, and\u0014\nconsequences.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      3. Walk the walk, talk the talk. The President's\u0014\nprayer\u0014\n                      breakfast testimony, a letter to his Southern\u0014\nBaptist\u0014\n                      congregation, his remarks before \nAfrican-American\u0014\nchurches,\u0014\n                      his counseling relationship with clergyPhilip\u0014\nWogaman,\u0014\n                      Jessie Jackson, Tony Campolo, and Gordon\u0014\n                      MacDonaldand most recently his chat with Bill\u0014\nHybels at a\u0014\n                      Willow Creek Church leadership conference place\u0014\nthe\u0014\n                      question of repentance squarely before us.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      In Christianity, repentance shows up in two\u0014\nplaces: in\u0014\n                      conversion, as it springs from saving faith, and\u0014\nlater in the\u0014\n                      Christian, as part of a sanctification, a\u0014\nre-turning, ever and\u0014\n                      again, from the sin that persists in the life of\u0014\nthe redeemed, all\u0014\n                      by grace alone.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      What are the elements of such repentance? The\u0014\n                      Reformation's Second Helvetic Confession puts it\u0014\nthis way:\u0014\n \u0014\n                           By repentance we understand (1) the \nrecovery\u0014\n                           of a right mind in a sinful person awakened\u0014\nby\u0014\n                           the Word of the Gospel and the Holy Spirit,\u0014\nand\u0014\n                           received by true faith, by which the sinner\u0014\n                           immediately acknowledges his innate\u0014\ncorruption\u0014\n                           and all his sins accused by the Word of \nGod;\u0014\n                           and (2) grieves for them from the heart, \nand\u0014\nnot\u0014\n                           only bewails and frankly confesses them\u0014\nbefore\u0014\n                           God with a feeling of shame; but also (3)\u0014\nwith\u0014\n                           indignation abominates them; and (4) now\u0014\n                           zealously considers the amendment of his\u0014\n                           ways and constantly strives for innocence \nand\u0014\n \u0014\n                           virtue in which conscientiously to exercise\u0014\n                           himself all the rest of his life.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      This is tough talk. Repentance, so described, is\u0014\nan inner and\u0014\n                      outer about-face, the Greek metanoia: a change \nof\u0014\nmind and\u0014\n                      heart, mouth, hands, and feet. An assurance of\u0014\npardon in\u0014\n                      response to a \"general confession of sin\" of the\u0014\nkind used in\u0014\n                      many Protestant Sunday services strikes the same\u0014\nnotes.\u0014\n                      Pardon is, as my Evangelical and Reformed hymnal\u0014\nputs it,\u0014\n                      assured \"unto as many of you, beloved, as truly\u0014\nrepent of\u0014\n                      your sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ\u0014\nwith full\u0014\n                      purpose of new obedience.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The discussion of these matters by Christians\u0014\nduring the\u0014\n                      Clinton crisis had to do with the meaning of\u0014\nrepentance in the\u0014\n                      Christian life, especially with \"walking the \nwalk\u0014\nas well as\u0014\n                      talking the talk.\" Such a conversation will go \non\u0014\nwith any\u0014\n                      president who professes the Christian faith. \nThat\u0014\nis why 200\u0014\n                      teachers of religion and ethics who issued \"A\u0014\nDeclaration\u0014\n                      Concerning Religion, Ethics, and the Crisis in \nthe\u0014\nClinton\u0014\n                      Presidency\" in 1998 questioned Clinton's\u0014\n\"incomplete\u0014\n                      repentance,\" asserting the need for amendment\u0014\nproportionate\u0014\n                      to sins confessed.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      4.

Another lesson from the Clinton \nlegacy\u0014\nis that\u0014\n                      we need to struggle with the question of how \nGod's\u0014\nmercy\u0014\n                      comes to the sinner.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Our Lord's parable of the Prodigal Son \nilluminates\u0014\nClinton's\u0014\n                      attempt at repentance. Did the father welcome \nthe\u0014\nerrant\u0014\n                      home because he knew his son returned penitent?\u0014\nNot\u0014\n                      according to the account in Scripture. The\u0014\nprodigal was \"yet\u0014\n                      afar off\" when the father ran to embrace him. \nThe\u0014\nparent had\u0014\n                      no knowledge of the son's reasons for return\u0014\n(could it be\u0014\n                      another plea for patrimony?), yet he put out the\u0014\nwelcome mat.\u0014\n                      God's unmerited, unconditional grace anxiously\u0014\nawaits\u0014\n                      sinners.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      What did it take for the Semitic parent,\u0014\nrighteously wrathful\u0014\n                      over the son's wasted substance, to make that\u0014\nmove? Surely\u0014\n                      it took a heart that accepted the judgment\u0014\ndeserved by the\u0014\n                      son into itself, a portent of God's suffering \nlove\u0014\non the cross.\u0014\n                      Divine forgiveness awaits the sinners because of\u0014\nChrist's\u0014\n                      sacrifice, not because of their good works such \nas\u0014\nacts of\u0014\n                      penitence. Grace is free!\u0014\n \u0014\n                      But it is not cheap, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u0014\npointed out in The\u0014\n                      Cost of Discipleship. Grace is there for the\u0014\ntaking, but you\u0014\n                      must receive it firsthand. Faith enabled the\u0014\nprodigal's reach for\u0014\n                      the grace-filled arms of the father. And the\u0014\nprodigal had to\u0014\n                      make that metanoia from old demons to get on the\u0014\nroad\u0014\n                      home, an about-face possible only by grace. A\u0014\ncostly\u0014\n                      repentance is not yet faith, but is inextricable\u0014\nfrom it.\u0014\n                      Paradoxically, grace costs nothing but it is\u0014\npriceless.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Did we forgive the prodigal? The plea of the \npious\u0014\nas well as\u0014\n                      many politicians was the same during the crisis:\u0014\n\"The\u0014\n                      President has repented. What more do you want?\" \nA\u0014\nfair\u0014\n                      question. Do we have the right to withhold our\u0014\nforgiveness and\u0014\n                      show less charity than Jesus Christ? Our mercy\u0014\nmust run in\u0014\n                      welcome like the proverbial earthly father and\u0014\nreach like the\u0014\n                      heavenly Father. Christian forgiveness comes\u0014\nwithout\u0014\n                      conditions, even before the word or deed of\u0014\nrepentance. Bill\u0014\n                      Clinton does not need to earn his salvation by\u0014\ngood works,\u0014\n                      including the words and deeds of repentance, any\u0014\nmore than\u0014\n                      we do.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Yet, like the prodigal, he must make a turn \ntoward\u0014\nhome to\u0014\n                      receive the proffered forgiveness. Grace is free\u0014\nbut not cheap.\u0014\n                      It is not ours to withhold forgiveness from the\u0014\nPresident. It is\u0014\n                      his to decide to accept it in the heart, with \nthe\u0014\nmouth, and by\u0014\n                      the feet.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The Christian conversation has implications for\u0014\nthe public\u0014\n                      conversation here. For Christians, the Clinton\u0014\nlegacy teaches\u0014\n                      another facet of the \"distinguishable but not\u0014\nseparable\" refrain\u0014\n                      in matters of morals, politics, and piety. In \nher\u0014\ncomments on\u0014\n                      forgiveness during the crisis, political\u0014\nphilosopher and\u0014\n                      theologian Jean Bethke Elshtain observed that \nPope\u0014\nJohn\u0014\n                      Paul II forgave his would-be assassin, but he \ndid\u0014\nnot plead for\u0014\n                      removal of the assailant's jail term. In the \nsame\u0014\nvein, a Boston\u0014\n                      pastor noted that Jesus forgave the thief on the\u0014\ncross but did\u0014\n                      not rescue him from his civil penalty. Both\u0014\ncomments\u0014\n                      recognize the distinction Christians must make\u0014\nbetween the\u0014\n                      gospel and law, the forgiveness freely given by\u0014\nthe grace of\u0014\n                      God and the accountability required by the norms\u0014\nof the\u0014\n                      state.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      5. Beware the hand of Jehu\u0014\n \u0014\n                           As Jehu drives his chariot through the \nPlain\u0014\nof\u0014\n                           Jezreel toward Samaria to kill the \nremaining\u0014\n                           members of the royal family, he invites the\u0014\n                           prophet Jehonadab to ride along: \"Come with\u0014\n                           me and see my zeal for the Lord.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      So observed biblical scholar Robert Jewett in\u0014\nJudgment Day\u0014\n                      at the White House, citing 2 Kings 10:16. He was\u0014\ndrawing an\u0014\n                      analogy between the temptations of Jehonadab and\u0014\nthe\u0014\n                      conduct of some clergy during the Clinton \ncrisis.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The hand of Jehu is ever extended. Ah, to ride \nin\u0014\nthe chariots\u0014\n                      of the mighty! The ready absolution given to\u0014\nClinton by some\u0014\n                      religious leaders in response to his words of\u0014\ncontrition made\u0014\n                      me think of the seduction of proximity to power.\u0014\nAmong\u0014\n                      others, Clinton got endorsements from Christian\u0014\nCentury\u0014\n                      editorials as well as from prominent \nevangelicals.\u0014\nAnd what\u0014\n                      do we make of Bill Hybels's recent hosting of a\u0014\nClinton\u0014\n                      apologia in the country's best-known megachurch?\u0014\nSix\u0014\n                      hundred members of that congregation gathered \nsoon\u0014\nafter to\u0014\n                      ask their pastor that question.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Was Clinton's apparent contrition just the White\u0014\nHouse way\u0014\n                      of seeking to refute the President's critics?\u0014\nReligious leaders\u0014\n                      need to learn something about the \"gee whiz\"\u0014\nfactor. To be on\u0014\n                      the list of invitees to the White House, to get \na\u0014\nphone call\u0014\n                      from the President, to have him sit in one of \nyour\u0014\npewsis\u0014\n                      this a hand up into the chariot? God help us if \nwe\u0014\ngive\u0014\n                      evidence for the Marxist charge that religion\u0014\nexists to provide\u0014\n                      cover for the powers that be.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Of course presidents need pastoral care. Clergy\u0014\nshould\u0014\n                      attend them, even with the temptations that come\u0014\nat the\u0014\n                      highest level of power. How to relate pastorally\u0014\nto those at the\u0014\n                      pinnacle but not capitulate politically to their\u0014\nagenda? The art\u0014\n                      of living in such tension doesn't come easy. In\u0014\ndoing so, the\u0014\n                      ministers should remember the companion story to\u0014\nJehu and\u0014\n                      Jehonadab, that of Nathan's response to the\u0014\nexecrable\u0014\n                      actions of David. Not only must the prophet \nrefuse\u0014\nto ride with\u0014\n                      the king; he must be ready to stand before that\u0014\nking and say\u0014\n                      firmly and publicly, \"You are the man!\" (2 \nSamuel\u0014\n12:7).\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Presidents hunger for a legacy that will shape\u0014\ngenerations to\u0014\n                      come.

When there's a\u0014\npossibility that lightning may strike, she simply shuts off \neverything in her house and\u0014\nsits alone in a darkened room until the danger passes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a word  a decidedly straightforward one  for Donna's very \nextreme\u0014\ncondition: electrophobia, or a morbid fear of electricity. You will \nfind it listed right below\u0014\neisoptrophobia (fear of mirrors) and not far above enetophobia, \neosophobia and\u0014\nereuthrophobia (fear of pins, daylight and blushing, respectively). \nAnd those are just\u0014\nsome of the Es. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor every phobia the infinitely inventive  and infinitely fearful  \nhuman mind can\u0014\ncreate, there is a word that has been coined to describe it. There's \nnephophobia, or\u0014\nfear of clouds, and coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. There's \nkathisophobia, fear of\u0014\nsitting, and kyphophobia, fear of stooping. There are xanthophobia, \nleukophobia and\u0014\nchromophobia, fear of yellow, white and colors in general. There are \nalektorophobia\u0014\nand apiphobia, fear of chickens and bees. And deep in the list, lost \nin the Ls, there's\u0014\nlutraphobia, or fear of otters  a fear that's useful, it would seem, \nonly if you happen to\u0014\nbe a mollusk. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe list of identified phobias is expanding every day and is now, of \ncourse, collected\u0014\nonline (phobialist.com), where more than 500 increasingly quirky \nhuman fears are\u0014\nlabeled, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, and cataloged alphabetically. \nSome have more\u0014\nto do with neology than psychology. (It's one thing to invent a word \nlike\u0014\narachibutyrophobia, another thing to find someone who's really afraid \nof peanut butter\u0014\nsticking to the roof of the mouth.) Other phobias, however  like \nacrophobia (fear of\u0014\nheights), claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) and agoraphobia (a \ncrushing,\u0014\nparalyzing terror of anything outside the safety of the home)  can \nbe deadly serious\u0014\nbusiness. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the names of phobias can be found online, the people who actually \nsuffer from at\u0014\nleast one of them at some point in their life  about 50 million in \nthe U.S. by some\u0014\nestimates  are everywhere. They may be like \"Beth,\" a pseudonym, a \nmiddle school\u0014\nstudent in Boston whose hemophobia, or fear of blood, was so severe \nthat even a\u0014\nfigure of speech like \"cut it out\" could make her faint. Or they may \nbe like \"Jean,\" 38,\u0014\nan executive assistant in New Jersey who is so terrified of balloons \nthat just walking\u0014\ninto a birthday party can make her break out in a sweat. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor most people, the treatment of phobias has been a cope-as-you-go \nbusiness:\u0014\npreflight cocktails for the fearful flyer, stairways instead of \nelevators for the\u0014\nclaustrophobe. But such home-brew tactics are usually only stopgaps \nat best.\u0014\nHappily, safe and lasting phobia treatments are now at hand. In an \nera in which more\u0014\nand more emotional disorders are falling before the scythe of \nscience, phobias are\u0014\namong the disorders falling fastest. \u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers are making enormous progress in determining what phobias \nare, what\u0014\nkinds of neurochemical storms they trigger in the brain and for what \nevolutionary\u0014\npurpose the potential for such psychic squalls was encoded into us in \nthe first place.\u0014\nWith this understanding has come a magic bag of treatments: exposure \ntherapy that\u0014\ncan stomp out a lifetime phobia in a single six-hour session; \nvirtual-reality programs\u0014\nthat can safely simulate the thing the phobic most fears, slowly \nstripping it of its power\u0014\nto terrorize; new medications that can snuff the brain's phobic spark \nbefore it can\u0014\ncatch. In the past year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \napproved the first drug\u0014\n an existing antidepressant called Paxil  specifically for the \ntreatment of social\u0014\nphobias. And just last week the Anxiety Disorders Association of \nAmerica held a\u0014\nfour-day seminar in Atlanta on a wide range of topics, including how \nto recognize and\u0014\novercome social phobias, how to spot phobia and anxiety disorders in \nchildren and\u0014\nhow to help patients maintain gains achieved in treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's been nothing like this in the field of mental health,\" says \npsychologist David\u0014\nH. Barlow, director of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders \nat Boston\u0014\nUniversity. \"In the past few years, we've had a complete turnaround \nin the treatment of\u0014\nphobic disorders.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFor something that can cause as much suffering as a phobia, it's \nremarkable how\u0014\nmany people lay claim to having one  and how many of them are wrong.\u0014\nSelf-described computer phobics are probably nothing of the kind. \nThey may not care\u0014\nfor the infernal machines and may occasionally want to throw one out \nthe window, but\u0014\nthat's not the same as a full-fledged phobia. Self-described \nclaustrophobics often\u0014\nmisdiagnose as well. The middle seat on a transatlantic flight may be \nsomething you\u0014\napproach with dismay, but unless you also experience a racing heart \nand ragged\u0014\nbreath, you are probably not phobic. Drawing the distinction between \ndistaste and the\u0014\nsingular terror of a phobia is not always easy  and it's made all \nthe harder by the fact\u0014\nthat fear in some circumstances is perfectly appropriate. If flying \ninto a storm or easing\u0014\ninto weaving traffic isn't the right time to go a little white \nknuckled, what is? \u0014\n\u0014\nExperts, however, say a true phobic reaction is a whole different \ncategory of terror, a\u0014\ncentral nervous system wildfire that's impossible to mistake. In the \nface of the thing\u0014\nthat triggers fear, phobics experience sweating, racing heart, \ndifficulty breathing and\u0014\neven a fear of imminent death  all accompanied by an overwhelming \nneed to flee. In\u0014\naddition, much of the time that they are away from the feared object \nor situation is\u0014\nspent dreading the next encounter and developing elaborate strategies \nintended to\u0014\navoid it. \"Jeanette,\" 44, a teacher's assistant, is so terrified of \ncats that she sends her\u0014\ndaughter, 21, into an unfamiliar store to scout around and sound a \nfeline all clear\u0014\nbefore she enters. The daughter has been walking point this way since \nage five.\u0014\n\"Nora,\" 50, a social worker, will circumnavigate a block with a \nseries of right turns\u0014\nrather than make a single left, so afraid is she of facing the stream \nof traffic that a left\u0014\nturn requires. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost psychologists now assign phobias to one of three broad \ncategories: social\u0014\nphobias, in which the sufferer feels paralyzing fear at the prospect \nof social or\u0014\nprofessional encounters; panic disorders, in which the person is \nperiodically blindsided\u0014\nby overwhelming fear for no apparent reason; and specific phobias  \nfear of snakes\u0014\nand enclosed spaces and heights and the like. Of the three, the \nspecific phobias are\u0014\nthe easiest to treat, partly because they are the easiest to \nunderstand. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe human brain may be a sophisticated thing, but there is an awful \nlot of ancient\u0014\nprogramming still etched into it. For \"Martin,\" 21, a dental student \nin London, Ontario,\u0014\nhis fear of snakes is so overwhelming that he stapled together pages \nin a textbook to\u0014\navoid flipping to a photo of a snake. He often wakes with nightmares \nthat he is sitting\u0014\nin a bar or a stadium and suddenly sees a snake slithering toward \nhim. \"It's odd,\" he\u0014\nsays, \"because I'm not in situations where I would ever see snakes.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHis brain, however  or at least the oldest parts of it  may have \nbeen. One of the\u0014\nthings that helped early humans survive was a robust fear-and-flight \nresponse: an\u0014\ninnate sense of the places and things that represent danger and a \nreflexive impulse to\u0014\nhightail it when one of them is encountered. When the species became \ntop predator a\u0014\nfew million years later, those early lessons were not easy to \nunlearn. \u0014\n\u0014\nContemporary researchers believe it's no coincidence that specific \nphobias usually fall\u0014\ninto one of four subcategories, all of which would have had meaning \nfor our ancient\u0014\nancestors: fear of insects or animals; fear of natural environments, \nlike heights and the\u0014\ndark; fear of blood or injury; and fear of dangerous situations, like \nbeing trapped in a\u0014\ntight space. \"Phobias are not random,\" says Michelle Craske, \npsychologist at ucla's\u0014\nAnxiety and Behavioral Disorders Program. \"We tend to fear anything \nthat threatens\u0014\nour survival as a species.\" When times change, new fears develop, but \nthe vast\u0014\nmajority still fit into one of the four groups. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt turns out that we process the fear of these modern menaces in the \nsame area of the\u0014\nbrain our ancient ancestors did  the paralimbic region, which \nmediates a whole\u0014\nrange of primal responses, including anger and sexual arousal. \"It \nseems that\u0014\ncontemporary people learned from their ancient ancestors what to be \nafraid of and how\u0014\nto handle it,\" Barlow says. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot all of us, however, parlay that ancient history into a modern-day \nphobia. It may be\u0014\nour distant ancestors who predispose us to phobias, but it's our \nimmediate ancestors\u0014\n specifically our parents  who seal the deal. As many as 40% of all \npeople\u0014\nsuffering from a specific phobia have at least one phobic parent, \nseemingly a clue that\u0014\nphobias could be genetically influenced. In recent years, a number of \nscientists have\u0014\nclaimed to have found the phobia gene, but none of those claims have \nheld up to\u0014\nscrutiny. If phobias are genetically based at all, they almost \ncertainly require a whole\u0014\ntangle of genes to get the process going. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut genetics doesn't even have to be involved as long as learning is. \nA childhood\u0014\ntrauma  a house fire, say, or a dog bite  may be more than enough \nto seize the\u0014\nbrain's attention and serve as a repository for incipient fears. \n\"Temperament also\u0014\nseems to be critical,\" says Craske. \"Two people can go through the \nexact same\u0014\ntraumatic event, but the high-strung, emotionally sensitive person is \nmore vulnerable to\u0014\nthe fear.\" Even secondhand fears  watching Mom or Dad react with \nexaggerated\u0014\nterror to a cockroach or a drop of blood, for example  may play a \nrole. The journal\u0014\nNature last week reported a study in which researchers performed \nscans on the fear\u0014\ncenters of volunteers' brains and found that when the subjects were \nmerely told to\u0014\nexpect an electric shock, the neurological reaction to the \nanticipated jolt was as\u0014\npowerful as fears based on actual experience. \"There is a lot of \nlegitimacy to the idea\u0014\nthat phobias can be learned,\" says Edna B. Foa, professor of \npsychology and\u0014\npsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. \"We respond to what we \nsee or\u0014\nexperience.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn many cases, the brain may think it's doing the child's psyche a \nfavor by developing\u0014\na phobia. The world is a scary place, and young kids are inherently \nfearful until they\u0014\nstart to figure it out. If you are living with a generalized sense of \ndanger, it can be\u0014\nprofoundly therapeutic to find a single object on which to deposit \nall that unformed fear\u0014\n a snake, a spider, a rat. A specific phobia becomes a sort of \nbackfire for fear, a\u0014\ncontrolled blaze that prevents other blazes from catching. \"The \nthinking mind seeks\u0014\nout a rationale for the primitive mind's unexplained experiences,\" \nsays psychologist\u0014\nSteven Phillipson, clinical director of the Center for \nCognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\u0014\nin New York City. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut a condition that is so easy to pick up is becoming almost as easy \nto shake,\u0014\nusually without resort to drugs. What turns up the wattage of a \nphobia the most is the\u0014\nstrategy the phobics rely on to ease their discomfort: avoidance. The \nharder phobics\u0014\nwork to avoid the things they fear, the more the brain grows \nconvinced that the threat\u0014\nis real. \"The things you do to reduce anxiety just make it worse,\" \nsays Barlow. \"We\u0014\nhave to strip those things away.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that's what doctors do. A patient visiting Barlow's Boston clinic \nis first assessed\u0014\nfor the presence of a specific phobia and then guided through an \nintensive day or two\u0014\nof graduated exposure. People who are afraid of syringes and blood, \nfor example, may\u0014\nfirst be shown a magazine photo with a trace of blood depicted in it. \nInnocuous photos\u0014\ngive way to graphic ones, and graphic ones to a display of a real, \nempty syringe. Over\u0014\ntime, the syringe is brought closer, and the patient learns to hold \nit and even tolerate\u0014\nhaving blood drawn. \u0014\n\u0014\nNone of this is remotely easy for the phobic person, and the body's \nanxiety Klaxons\u0014\nmay go off the instant the therapy begins. Gradually, however, as \neach exposure level\u0014\nis reached, the alarms start to quiet; they sound again only when the \nintensity of the\u0014\nexposure is turned up. \"Just as people become habituated to the noise \nof traffic or\u0014\nbackground chatter, so too can phobics become nonresponsive to the \nthing that once\u0014\nfrightened them,\" says Phillipson. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith that habituation comes profound recovery. In studies recently \nconducted by Lars\u0014\nGoran Ost, a psychology professor at Stockholm University and one of \nthe pioneers of\u0014\none-day phobia treatments, a staggering 80% to 95% of patients get \ntheir phobias\u0014\nunder control after just one session. And when symptoms disappear, \nthey usually stay\u0014\ngone. Patients, he says, rarely experience a significant phobic \nrelapse, and almost\u0014\nnever replace the thing they no longer fear with a fresher phobia \nobject. \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the apparent simplicity of exposure therapy, phobics may be \ntempted to try it\u0014\nthemselves. That can be a mistake. It is important that exposure take \nplace under the\u0014\ncare of a professional, since it takes a trained person to know when \npatients are being\u0014\npushed too far and when it's safe to go further. For some situations \nimpossible to\u0014\nre-create in a doctor's office  like heights and flying in airplanes \n virtual-reality\u0014\nprograms are available to provide simulated exposure under \nprofessional supervision.\u0014\nSoftware for other fears is being written all the time. \"Not all \npeople respond to virtual\u0014\nreality,\" says Barlow, \"but on average, it's just as effective for \ntreating certain phobias.\"\u0014\nIf specific phobias were the only type of phobias around, things \nwould be decidedly\u0014\neasier for doctors and patients. But the two other members of the \nphobia troika \u0014\nsocial phobias and panic disorders  can be a little trickier. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf the 50 million Americans who have experienced or will someday \nsuffer from a\u0014\nphobia (and many will have more than one), 35 million will suffer \nfrom social phobia,\u0014\nand the battle they fight is a harrowing one. Richard Heimberg at \nTemple University's\u0014\nAdult Anxiety Clinic often thinks of the 50-year-old patient who \ntalked frequently about\u0014\ngetting married and having a family  a reasonable dream, except that \nhis terror of\u0014\nrejection had kept him from ever going out on a date. After much \nencouragement and\u0014\ncounseling, he finally screwed up his courage enough to ask a woman \nout. The next\u0014\nday, when Heimberg asked him if he'd had a good time, he said yes. \nBut when asked\u0014\nif he were going to invite her out again, the patient slumped and \nsaid no. \"She's only\u0014\ngoing to give to charity once,\" he explained. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor this patient, the problem wasn't mere low self-esteem but \noutright terror. To a\u0014\nsocial phobic, the mere prospect of a social encounter is frightening \nenough to cause\u0014\nsweating, trembling, light-headedness and nausea, accompanied by an \noverwhelming\u0014\nfeeling of inadequacy. For some sufferers, the disorder is \ncomparatively circumscribed\u0014\n occurring only at large parties, say  making avoidance strategies \nseem easy. But\u0014\nsocial phobias can encroach into more and more areas of life, closing \nmore and more\u0014\ndoors. As sufferers grow increasingly isolated, they grow \nincreasingly hopeless and\u0014\nrisk developing such conditions as depression and alcoholism. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut things don't have to be so bleak. While social phobias do not \nrespond to a single\u0014\nintensive exposure session as specific phobias do, therapy can still \nbe relatively\u0014\nstraightforward. A successful treatment regimen may involve no more \nthan a dozen\u0014\nsessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy, in which patients slowly \nexpose themselves\u0014\nto the places and circumstances that frighten them and reframe the \ncatastrophic\u0014\nthinking that torments them. They are taught to tone down their \n\"attentional bias,\" a\u0014\ntendency to stress their supposed social stumbles, and their \n\"interpretation bias,\" a\u0014\nhabit of picking up neutral cues from other people and interpreting \nthem as evidence of\u0014\nfailing socially. Often group therapy works better than one-on-one \ntherapy. It provides\u0014\nmore than a supportive circle of fellow sufferers: the very act of \ngathering with other\u0014\npeople can serve as a first, critical rebellion against the disorder. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf such therapy doesn't help social phobics, drugs can. Ever since \nthe popularization of\u0014\nProzac in the early 1990s, the family of modern psychopharmacological \ndrugs has\u0014\ngrown steadily. Most of these medications are selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors\u0014\n or ssris  which, as the name implies, selectively block the \nbrain's reabsorption of\u0014\nthe neurotransmitter serotonin, helping produce feelings of \nsatisfaction and kick-start\u0014\nrecovery. Last year the drug manufacturer SmithKline Beecham asked \nthe Food and\u0014\nDrug Administration to take a second look at the popular ssri Paxil \nand consider\u0014\napproving it specifically for the treatment of social-anxiety \ndisorder. The fda agreed,\u0014\nmaking Paxil the first drug ever to be formally endorsed for such \nuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the flood of marketing tends to overstate the case, the fact \nis, Paxil works \u0014\nnot by eliminating anxiety entirely but by controlling it enough for \ntraditional therapy to\u0014\ntake hold. And with the pharmacological door now open, makers of \nsimilar drugs like\u0014\nLuvox, Prozac and Celexa will probably seek the same certification. \n\"Paxil is not\u0014\nunique among these drugs,\" says Barlow. \"It was just first in line.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nProgress in treating social-anxiety disorder is also providing hope \nfor the last  and\u0014\nmost disabling  of the family of phobias: panic disorder. Panic \ndisorder is to anxiety\u0014\nconditions what a tornado is to weather conditions: a devastating \nsneak attack that\u0014\nappears from nowhere, wreaks havoc and then simply vanishes. Unlike \nthe specific\u0014\nphobic and the social phobic who know what will trigger their fear, \nthe victim of panic\u0014\nattacks never knows where or when one will hit. Someone who \nexperiences an attack\u0014\nin, say, a supermarket will often not return there, associating the \nonce neutral place\u0014\nwith the traumatic event. But the perceived circle of safety can \nquickly shrink, until\u0014\nsufferers may be confined entirely to their homes. When this begins \nto happen, panic\u0014\ndisorder mutates into full-blown agoraphobia. \"For some people, even \nthe house\u0014\nbecomes too big,\" says Fordham University psychology professor Dean \nMcKay. \"They\u0014\nmay limit their world to just a few rooms.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe treatment for agoraphobia is much the same as it is for social \nphobia:\u0014\ncognitive-behavioral therapy and drugs. In many cases, recovery takes \nlonger than it\u0014\ndoes for social phobias because agoraphobic behavior can become so \nentrenched.\u0014\nNonetheless, once therapy and drug treatments get under way, they \nsometimes move\u0014\nsurprisingly quickly. \"The best way to treat agoraphobia,\" says Ost, \n\"is by individual\u0014\ntherapy, once a week for 10 or 12 weeks.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIf science has so many phobias on the run, does that mean that the \nproblem as a\u0014\nwhole can soon be considered solved? Hardly. Like all other emotional \ndisorders,\u0014\nphobias cause a double dip of psychic pain: from the condition and \nfrom the shame of\u0014\nhaving the problem in the first place. Over the years, researchers \nhave made much of\u0014\nthe fact that the large majority of phobia sufferers are women  from \n55% for social\u0014\nphobias and up to 90% for specific phobias and extreme cases of \nagoraphobia.\u0014\nHormones, genes and culture have all been explored as explanations. \nBut the simplest\u0014\nanswer may be that women own up to the condition more readily than \nmen do. If you\u0014\ndon't come forward with your problem, you can't be included in the \nepidemiologists'\u0014\ncount. Worse, you can never avail yourself of the therapists' cure. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaking things even tougher, phobias are often hard to distinguish \nfrom other anxiety\u0014\ndisorders. A person who feels compelled to wash or shower dozens of \ntimes a day\u0014\nmay have a phobic's terror of germs, but a clinician would easily peg \nthe problem as\u0014\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, not a specific phobia. The survivor of \nan airline crash\u0014\nmay exhibit a phobic's panic at even a picture of a plane, but likely \nas not, the fear is\u0014\none component of a larger case of post-traumatic stress disorder. \nDifferent conditions\u0014\nrequire different treatments, and without the right care, the problem \nis unlikely to clear\u0014\nup. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that phobias, of all the anxiety disorders, can be overcome \nso readily is one of\u0014\npsychology's brightest bits of clinical news in a long time. Phobias \ncan beat the\u0014\nstuffing out of sufferers because the feelings they generate seem so \nreal and the\u0014\ndangers they warn of so great. Most of the time, however, the dangers \nare mere\u0014\nneurochemical lies  and the lies have to be exposed. \"Your instincts \ntell you to\u0014\nescape or avoid,\" says Phillipson. \"But what you really need to do is \nface down the\u0014\nfear.\" When you spend your life in a cautionary crouch, the greatest \nrelief of all may\u0014\ncome from simply standing up.\u0014",

Originally, the term was used to mean \n\"believing in the fundamentals\u0014\n         (or essentials) of the Christian faith.\" That is, believing \nin several points:\u0014\n\u0014\n              That there is one God, Who is revealed in three Persons \n(Father, Son, and Holy\u0014\n              Spirit); that is, each Person of the Godhead has a \ndistinct \"personality\" and is\u0014\n              aware of the existance of the others, but the three \nPersons together form one Infinite\u0014\n              God \u0014\n              That God is personal and can be known by man, and works \nin His world, to the\u0014\n              benefit of mankind \u0014\n              That man is inherently sinful, and can do nothing to \nplease God on his own \u0014\n              That only through the redemptive power of the second \nPerson of the triune Godhead\u0014\n              (Jesus Christ) can man be adopted into God's family \u0014\n              That one accepts the forgiveness of his sins solely \nthrough faith, and not by any\u0014\n              work one can do \u0014\n              That one is \"born again\" when one accepts Christ's \nfinished work on the cross by\u0014\n              faith, and that the Holy Spirit lives within the person \nwho is born again \u0014\n              That the Bible is essentially the complete Word of God \nas He wanted us to know it \u0014\n\u0014\n         In other words, \"fundamentalist\" originally was synonymous \nwith \"Christian.\" Speaking to\u0014\n         the denotative definition of \"fundamentalist,\" this is still \ntrue. Any true Christian (at least\u0014\n         every one that I have ever met) believes these points. When \nI say \"true Christian,\" I do so\u0014\n         to exclude categories of \"Christians\" such as liberals and \ncasual church-goers that do not\u0014\n         measure up to the historical definition of \"Christian.\" My \narticle Four Categories of Church\u0014\n         Members discusses these different categories of church \nmembers in detail.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Over time, and with the rise of (originally German) \"higher \ncriticism,\" the word made a slight\u0014\n         transformation. As of the beginning of the 20th century, \n\"fundamentalism\" became focused\u0014\n         more on point 2 above. That is, the higher critics \n(generally liberals) applied the term to\u0014\n         those who believed that God is active in His world. He is \nactive the world in several ways:\u0014\n         through His direct inspiration of people (including Biblical \nauthors), through miracles, and\u0014\n         through answers to prayer. It was (I believe) this sense of \nthe word that C. S. Lewis used\u0014\n         when he unapoligetically said that he was a fundamentalist. \nAlthough this definition of the\u0014\n         word had been at this point narrowed from the original, it \nstill essentially included part of\u0014\n         what it meant to be a Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Later in the 20th century, however, this situation changed. \nThe term \"fundamentalist\" now\u0014\n         became a perjorative term. To many people (especially the \nafore-mentioned liberals), the\u0014\n         term \"fundamentalist\" embodied everything they saw to be bad \nabout the Christian religion.\u0014\n         Strictness, intolerance, puritanism were all wrapped up \nwithin their use of the term. To call\u0014\n         somebody a \"fundamentalist\" became an insult.\u0014\n\u0014\n         At this point, the term's denotative meaning appears to have \nbeen completely lost. As with\u0014\n         many other terms (for example, homophobia), the denotative \nmeaning became\u0014\n         unimportant; the word was used primarily to gain political \nor rhetorical advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Born again?\u0014\n\u0014\n         People sometimes confuse \"born-again\" with \"fundamentalist.\" \nThis is easy to do,\u0014\n         especially since, according to the denotative meaning of \n\"fundamentalist,\" they typically\u0014\n         end up meaning the same thing. However, under the \nconnotative meaning of\u0014\n         \"fundamentalist,\" they are certainly not the same thing. \nDenotatively, \"Born-again\" is,\u0014\n         again, synonymous with \"Christian.\" The basic term is much \nmore descriptive than\u0014\n         \"fundamentalist\" since the latter only means believing the \nfundamentals of something. One\u0014\n         can thus also have Moslem fundamentalists, Jewish \nfundamentalists, even (here's a funny\u0014\n         thought) liberal fundamentalists. Hmmm ... I need to think \nabout that last one.\u0014\n\u0014\n         \"Born-again,\" on the other hand, is directly Biblical. Jesus \ntold Nicodemus that, in order to\u0014\n         see the kingdom of God, he must be born again. It means \nthat, through faith, one accepts\u0014\n         the redemption provided by Jesus Christ on the cross, and \nimmediately one is born a\u0014\n         second time through the power of the Spirit. Theologians \nsometimes call this rebirth\u0014\n         \"regeneration,\" and it is a very good term, for it says that \none has been created anew.\u0014\n         Every old power is your life is gone; where sin and death \nruled the unregenerate life, God\u0014\n         provides a new power to rule over one's life.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Unfortunately, the term \"born-again\" has also acquired \nconnotative meanings, and now in\u0014\n         many people's minds means the same as the connotative \nmeaning of \"fundamentalist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n         Evangelical?\u0014\n\u0014\n         In recent years, many Christians (including myself) have \ntaken to using a different word to\u0014\n         have the same original, denotative meaning of \n\"fundamentalist.\" This term is \"evangelical,\"\u0014\n         and it just means \"believing in the good news (or Gospel).\" \nAn evangelical, then, believes in\u0014\n         the points listed at the top of this page. Many of the \nbest-known Bible teachers and\u0014\n         evangelists of today (including Billy Graham, Greg Laurie, \nHank Hannegraff, Chuck\u0014\n         Swindoll, John MacArthur, etc.) consider themselves to be \nevangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Even among us who call ourselves \"evangelicals,\" there is a \ndistancing from the term\u0014\n         \"fundamentalist,\" because we all know people who do \n(unfortunately) have some of the\u0014\n         characteristics of the connotative fundamentalist. That is, \nthey are sometimes overly\u0014\n         judgmental, and sometimes believe in a works-based \nsalvation. Under this definition,\u0014\n         \"fundamantalists\" are often not even true Christians, as \nChristians are not under a\u0014\n         works-based system of salvation. Please see my note on \ntraditionalists under my Four\u0014\n         categories of Church Members document.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Once again, those who oppose historic Christianity are \ntransforming the term \"evangelical\"\u0014\n         in the same way they have transformed the other words \nmentioned above, so it, too, may\u0014\n         soon become lost in the connotative quagmire.\u0014\n\u0014\n         So, what am I?\u0014\n\u0014\n         If you want to use the denotative meanings of the terms, you \nmay call me a fundamentalist,\u0014\n         born-again Christian, or an evangelical. For that matter, \ncall me other words that have the\u0014\n         identical denotative meaning: \"believer,\" \"saved,\" or \n\"Christian.\" As mentioned above, the\u0014\n         denotative meanings are essentially identical.\u0014\n\u0014\n         However, given the strong (and probably irreversible) \nconnotative meaning attached to\u0014\n         \"fundamentalist,\" I would prefer to say that I am not one. I \nwould consider myself a\u0014\n         born-again Christian, or an evangelical.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n         This document Copyright  1998 Gary Bisaga. All rights \nreserved.

    "title": "FRIEDRICH ENGELS, COLLABORATOR WITH MARX",
    "words": "Friedrich Engels, the son of a successful German industrialist, \nwas born in Barmen in 1820. As a young man his father sent\u0014\n      him to England to work at his cotton-factory in Manchester. \nEngels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an\u0014\n      account that was published as Condition of the Working Classes \nin England (1844). He also made friends with the leaders of\u0014\n      the Chartist movement in Britain. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In 1844 Engels began contributing to a radical journal called \nFranco-German Annals that was being edited by Karl Marx in Paris.\u0014\n      Later that year Engels met Marx and the two men became close \nfriends. Engels shared Marx's views on capitalism and after\u0014\n      their first meeting he wrote that there was virtually \"complete \nagreement in all theoretical fields\". Marx and Engels decided to\u0014\n      work together. It was a good partnership, whereas Marx was at \nhis best when dealing with difficult abstract concepts, Engels\u0014\n      had the ability to write for a mass audience. \u0014\n\u0014\n      While working on their first article together, The Holy Family, \nthe Prussian authorities put pressure on the French government to\u0014\n      expel Karl Marx from the country. On 25th January 1845, Marx \nreceived an order deporting him from France. Marx and Engels\u0014\n      decided to move to Belgium, a country that permitted greater \nfreedom of expression than any other European state. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Friedrich Engels helped to financially support Marx and his \nfamily. Engels gave Marx the royalties of his book, Condition of the\u0014\n      Working Class in England and arranged for other sympathizers to \nmake donations. This enabled Marx the time to study and\u0014\n      develop his economic and political theories. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In July 1845 Engels took Karl Marx to England. They spent most \nof the time consulting books in Manchester Library. During\u0014\n      their six weeks in England, Engels introduced Marx to several \nof the Chartist leaders including George Julian Harney. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Engels and Marx returned to Brussels and in January 1846 they \nset up a Communist Correspondence Committee. The plan\u0014\n      was to try and link together socialist leaders living in \ndifferent parts of Europe. Influenced by Marx's ideas, socialists in \nEngland\u0014\n      held a conference in London where they formed a new \norganisation called the Communist League. Engels attended as a\u0014\n      delegate and took part in developing a strategy of action. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Engels returned to England in December 1847 where he attended a \nmeeting of the Communist League' Central Committee in\u0014\n      London. At the meeting it was decided that the aims of the \norganisation was \"the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the domination of\u0014\n      the proletariat, the abolition of the old bourgeois society \nbased on class antagonisms, and the establishment of a new society\u0014\n      without classes and without private property\". \u0014\n\u0014\n      Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together. Based on a \nfirst draft produced by Engels called the Principles of\u0014\n      Communism, Marx finished the 12,000 word pamphlet in six weeks. \nUnlike most of Marx's work, it was an accessible account\u0014\n      of communist ideology. Written for a mass audience, The \nCommunist Manifesto summarised the forthcoming revolution and the\u0014\n      nature of the communist society that would be established by \nthe proletariat. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The Communist Manifesto was published in February, 1848. The \nfollowing month, the government expelled Engels and Marx\u0014\n      from Belgium. Marx and Engels visited Paris before moving to \nCologne where they founded a radical newspaper, New Rhenish\u0014\n      Gazette. The men hoped to use the newspaper to encourage the \nrevolutionary atmosphere that they had witnessed in Paris. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Engels helped form an organisation called the Rhineland \nDemocrats. On 25th September, 1848, several of the leaders of the\u0014\n      group were arrested. Engels managed to escape but was forced to \nleave the country. Karl Marx continued to publish the New\u0014\n      Rhenish Gazette until he was expelled in May, 1849. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Engels and Marx now moved to London. The Prussian authorities \napplied pressure on the British government to expel the two\u0014\n      men but the Prime Minister, John Russell, held liberal views on \nfreedom of expression and refused. With only the money that\u0014\n      Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In order to help supply Karl Marx with an income, Engels \nreturned to work for his father in Germany. The two kept in constant\u0014\n      contact and over the next twenty years they wrote to each other \non average once every two days. Friedrich Engels sent postal\u0014\n      orders or 1 or 5 notes, cut in half and sent in separate \nenvelopes. In this way the Marx family was able to survive. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Karl Marx died in London in March, 1883. Engels now devoted the \nrest of his life to editing and translating Marx's writings. This\u0014\n      included the second volume of Das Kapital (1885). Engels then \nused Marx's notes to write the third volume of Das Kapital\u0014\n      (1894). Friedrich Engels died in 1895.\u0014",

    "title": "FUNDAMENTALISM IS ONE OF TWO GREAT HERESIES",
    "words": "Fundamentalism is the second of the two great heresies of our time. \nFundamentalism is more dangerous than Liberalism because everything \nis done in the name of the Lord. In the name of the Lord, the \nFundamentalist (note the capital F again) condemns any who disagree \nwith him. In the name of the Lord all is done, and great heresy is \npropagated across the land. The basic tenet of Fundamentalism is \nproper doctrine. The most important thing in the world is to believe \nthe right things. The Bible is seen as the inspired Word of God; \ngreat pain is taken to stick to the letter of the Word in every \nrespect as far as outward signs of conduct are concerned. \u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism dwells heavily on the outward trappings of religion. \nThe inward fruits of the spirit are proclaimed by the Fundamentalist, \nbut seldom seen in his life. Though the glory of Baptists has always \nbeen that we are not a creedal people, Fundamentalism states a creed \nthrough its doctrine and insists upon agreement at every point if \nfellowship is to be maintained. Its ecclesiology is from the Landmark \nmovement of another day. While it insists on the importance of the \nlocal church, it endeavors to make of all churches the same. In \neffect, it pushes for the One Church concept, with all others being \nexcluded and castigated as heretics. Tradition is most important to \nthe Fundamentalist. Often his doctrine is a strange mixture of Bible \nand tradition intermingled, with equal authority given to both.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Fundamentalist is any person who feels he has a corner on truth \nand the rest of the Christian world is groping in error. He is always \ndogmatic about his beliefs. He views his ideas about God, the world, \nand man to be as valid as what God has revealed. He uses the Bible as \na club with which to beat people over the head, rather than a means \nof personal strength and a revealer of God. His approach is virtually \nalways negative and condemning. Whenever there is a cause to fight, \nhe is always in the middle of the fight. He knows little of positive \nliving or preaching. His entire life is a series of negatives which \nconsume more and more of his energies until it becomes his whole \napproach. To the Fundamentalists, the test of fellowship is correct \ndoctrine. If you do not agree with his doctrinal position, he writes \nyou off and will not have fellowship with you. There is no room in \nhis world for those who have a different persuasion. He feels \nthreatened by diverse convictions and writes them off as sinister and \nheretical. As long as you support his position, he is with you. Cross \nhim, and he has no use, whatever, for you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n(Draper, James T. Jr. \"The Church Christ Approves,\". Broadman Press. \n1974. pp. 38-39.)\u0014",

(What a nightmare! What a \ndisaster!) \u0014\n\u0014\n                 And the second question (the obverse of the first): \nWhy do masses\u0014\n                 of men and women feel such intense emotion about the \nlife and\u0014\n                 death of people who are strangers to \nthem--strangers, that is, except\u0014\n                 to the extent that masses of people have been \ndeceived by the\u0014\n                 tabloids into an illusion of intimacy with the \nfamous? \u0014\n\u0014\n                 If the intimacy was an illusion, is the grief an \nillusion as well? Or how\u0014\n                 exactly do we assess the emotional truth of these \noutpourings? A\u0014\n                 moment of poignant communion in the Family of Man?

Something to do with mortals and gods \nand goddesses? \u0014\n\u0014\n                 To be famous is among the basic human ambitions, of \ncourse, an all\u0014\n                 but universal fantasy. Who--except for nuns and \nmonks, say, who\u0014\n                 are content with God's radiant attention--sets out \nin life to remain\u0014\n                 obscure? Fame is fun--and vindication. One need \nnever be lonely,\u0014\n                 anywhere, ever. Fame has style, glamour, money, \nattention; ignites\u0014\n                 the sudden light of recognition in strangers' eyes, \ncommands the\u0014\n                 comic deference of headwaiters as they sweep you \npast the serfs\u0014\n                 and hoi polloi to the best table. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Some who have come to be famous see in retrospect \nthat the\u0014\n                 daydream may have been touchingly adolescent, \nself-inflating in the\u0014\n                 style of Mr. Toad. In some personalities, the need \nfor attention is\u0014\n                 darker and more retrograde: neurotic, infantile, a \nsort of baby's\u0014\n                 unappeasable love craving, a raw, screaming hunger. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In any case, one should beware of answered prayers. \nThose with\u0014\n                 hard experience at being famous know that while \ncelebrity can\u0014\n                 occasionally be delightful, it may become a burden, \nan arduous and\u0014\n                 menacing bore. Just how menacing it can be we saw in \nthe middle of\u0014\n                 that recent night in Paris. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It was always a primitive terror to be cast out of \nthe tribe and made to\u0014\n                 wander as a stranger. Today a famous person--Arnold\u0014\n                 Schwarzenegger, say, or Sylvester Stallone, those \nuniversal action\u0014\n                 figures whose films require the fewest subtitles and \ntherefore\u0014\n                 address masses most eloquently in remote \ncultures--might go\u0014\n                 anywhere on earth and never be a stranger. Is that \ndesirable? Or a\u0014\n                 horror? Such planetary recognition may be as \ndangerous, in a\u0014\n                 different way, as being an unknown alien once was. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The famed one is paradoxically as naked as an exile \ndispossessed.\u0014\n                 The celebrity enters into a powerful and potentially \ndangerous force\u0014\n                 field, a relationship with masses of people gone \nslightly insane;\u0014\n                 sometimes he encounters that side of human nature \nthat forms lynch\u0014\n                 mobs: the beast. A surreal dynamic goes to work. The \nfamous may\u0014\n                 find their fortunes held hostage by the moods and \nattention spans of\u0014\n                 people they do not know. The unstable affections of \nfandom have a\u0014\n                 life of their own and acquire an unpredictable but \nnearly absolute\u0014\n                 power over one's personal and professional fate. \nFame becomes a\u0014\n                 form of primitive, dangerous religion, like snake \nhandling. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The most extreme danger comes in the form of the \nsort of lethal\u0014\n                 nonentity who gunned down John Lennon. Other \nstalkers are less\u0014\n                 murderous but more numerous. In fandom, boundaries of\u0014\n                 individuality break down and enthusiasts come to \nthink they own the\u0014\n                 celebrity in some way. They behave with a bizarre, \nintrusive,\u0014\n                 proprietary aggression, as if the icon had entered \ntheir own head (as\u0014\n                 indeed the icon has) and thereby relinquished all \nrights of privacy\u0014\n                 and courtesy and become a plaything of fans' \nfantasy. Madonna has\u0014\n                 said that one of the worst things about being famous \nis that you\u0014\n                 cannot put your trash out on the sidewalk in front \nof your house:\u0014\n                 someone will plunder it. Autograph hunters are the \nmost benign of\u0014\n                 stalkers. The press, to a divorced princess, an \nactress or the U.S.\u0014\n                 President, represents a complex evil and \nprofessional necessity. The\u0014\n                 predations celebrities fear most from the press, \nespecially\u0014\n                 photographers, are intrusions into the lives of \ntheir children. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Sane, well-balanced celebrities accept their fame as \npart of their\u0014\n                 working life, but also an irrelevance and an \nintrusion and a pain in\u0014\n                 the neck. It is true that people live more \ncomfortably with fame when\u0014\n                 they are confident that it is something they have \nearned by their own\u0014\n                 merit and hard work over a period of time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The trouble is that fame at the end of the 20th \ncentury--a global,\u0014\n                 multicultural and multimedia saturation--gets \ndistributed by a sort of\u0014\n                 cultural chaos theory, detached not only from merit \nin many cases\u0014\n                 but also from any comprehensible framework of value \nand virtue.\u0014\n                 And so beneath the surface floats a fierce sense of \ninjustice--a\u0014\n                 sense of ethical dislocation, as if the laws of \ncause and effect had\u0014\n                 been rescinded. In such a culture, to be obscure is \nby definition to be\u0014\n                 a failure. The obscure man asks bitterly, \"Why is he \nfamous, and not\u0014\n                 I? What's he got that I haven't got?\" Manifestly, \nnothing. It is not the\u0014\n                 Salieri-Mozart configuration, mediocrity envying \ngenius; today, let\u0014\n                 some unsung brilliant political thinker wonder why \nDick Morris is\u0014\n                 famous for sucking a call girl's toes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 A guilty sense of the injustice of fame assaults the \nfamed one as well:\u0014\n                 \"Why am I famous? Why do all these people seem to \nlove me? I don't\u0014\n                 deserve it. I am a fraud.\" The anguished, neurotic \ninternal\u0014\n                 monologue gets dramatized in self-destructive ways \n(drug\u0014\n                 overdoses, alcohol, rampages, broken marriages, \nsuicides or, if the\u0014\n                 celebrities are lucky, a trudge through the rehab \nthat ends with\u0014\n                 confession and absolution in prime time: \"I feel \nmore centered now,\u0014\n                 Barbara\"); all this mess forms up as part of the \ngreat sobbing\u0014\n                 dysfunctional pageant on display at the supermarket \ncheck-out\u0014\n                 counters. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Fame is the delicious toxin that addicts the troubled\u0014\n                 famous--including Diana, for example, and, in \ndifferent ways, Elvis,\u0014\n                 Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando and Brigitte \nBardot--the waifs and\u0014\n                 shipwrecks. The troubled famous develop a virtually\u0014\n                 sadomasochistic, I-hate-it/I-need-it dependency on \nfame. They are\u0014\n                 married to it as unhappily as Strindberg couples are \nmarried to each\u0014\n                 other. They are imprisoned and isolated by their \nfame. In a curious\u0014\n                 fashion, the metaphysical loneliness of their fame \nmay expose and\u0014\n                 energize their worst latent flaws and turn them into \nmonstrous\u0014\n                 distortions of themselves: fame tends to draw their \nspirits away from\u0014\n                 them in the way that some tribal people fear that \nbeing photographed\u0014\n                 will steal their souls. Fame distributes their souls \nto the masses as in\u0014\n                 Communion. The famous get ingested by the world in \nsome primitive\u0014\n                 manner. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 That is the pathological side--the part of fame that \nappeals to the\u0014\n                 tabloid groundlings. Many famous people, of course, \nare worthy and\u0014\n                 righteous, and have even been much improved by their \nfame; all the\u0014\n                 public attention actually encourages them to rise to \nthe occasion.\u0014\n                 One thinks of veterans in show business like Sophia \nLoren, with her\u0014\n                 sexy, humorous sense of self and feet on the ground; \nor the late\u0014\n                 Audrey Hepburn; or Gregory Peck, who is still to be \nseen around\u0014\n                 Beverly Hills with majestic white mane and bushy \nblack thundercloud\u0014\n                 eyebrows and his air of formidably screwy gravitas. \nBut in general\u0014\n                 the sane-and-sober famous, in show business or \nelsewhere, pose\u0014\n                 the same problem to their chroniclers and their \npublic that God\u0014\n                 presented to John Milton when he was writing \nParadise Lost: Satan\u0014\n                 was a much more interesting character to describe, \nand to read\u0014\n                 about, than God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Fame is a nasty Faustian bargain, the famous find, \nbut with an\u0014\n                 inversion of the classic deal. Instead of selling \none's soul to the devil\u0014\n                 in order to know all things, as Faust did, one sells \none's soul in order\u0014\n                 to be known. A devolution from the active to the \npassive. The\u0014\n                 outcome is not happy in either case. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The ancient Greeks savored stories from Olympus that \nin our culture\u0014\n                 fill the \"People\" columns. Celebrities are what we \nhave instead of\u0014\n                 gods and goddesses. We mortals may get more out of \nthe famous\u0014\n                 than the famous get out of us. We get gaudy \nentertainment; life's\u0014\n                 possibilities and absurdities all heightened and \ntarted up with sex\u0014\n                 and sermonettes; vicarious excursions outside the \nconfines of\u0014\n                 oneself; a kind of narrative structure to \ncontemplate in our otherwise\u0014\n                 formless lives; fables with suspense and \ndenouement--as in Diana's\u0014\n                 story, which has a fairy-tale beginning, a troubled \nmiddle and a\u0014\n                 climax of pageant at the sad end. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It is a strange transaction. People projected all \nsorts of fantasies\u0014\n                 upon Princess Diana in somewhat the way girls \nproject little play\u0014\n                 scenarios upon Barbie dolls. Diana was a sort of\u0014\n                 Barbie-Ophelia--except that Barbie is an inanimate \ndoll and Ophelia\u0014\n                 a part played by an actress who, after her \nperformance, takes off her\u0014\n                 makeup and goes out for a late supper. Who would \nwant such\u0014\n                 sacrificial fame for keeps? Diana, a real person, \ndied, and stays\u0014\n                 dead. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Literature has better consolations than either life \nor tabloids. After\u0014\n                 Diana's funeral one wistfully looks up the quote at \nthe end of George\u0014\n                 Eliot's Middlemarch and reads: \"... For the growing \ngood of the world\u0014\n                 is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that \nthings are not so ill\u0014\n                 with you and me as they might have been, is half \nowing to the\u0014\n                 number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest \nin unvisited tombs.\"\u0014",

A\u0014\n    young defendant was convicted in Judge Tomei's court of gunning\u0014\n    down another person execution style. The murderer had a bad\u0014\n    record, was no stranger to the system, and only stared in anger\u0014\n    as the jury returned its guilty verdict.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The victim's family had attended every day of the two-week\u0014\n    trial.

    "title": "FATHERHOOD AND GRANDFATHERHOOD",
    "words": "Some years back Bill Cosby wrote a book simply entitled FATHERHOOD. \nIf you\u0014\never get a chance to read it I suggest you do. It is thoroughly \nhumorous You\u0014\nwill also learn a few things along the way.. I would like to share \nwith you\u0014\ntwo observations that Cosby makes about Fathers. He writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nNow that my father is a grandfather, he just cant wait to give money \nto my\u0014\nkids. But when I was his kid and I asked him for fifty cents, he \nwould tell\u0014\nme the story of his life. How he got up at 4 A.M. when he was seven \nyears\u0014\nold and walked twenty-three miles to milk ninety cows. And the farmer \nfor\u0014\nwhom he worked had no bucket, so he had to squirt the milk into his \nlittle\u0014\nhand and then walk eight miles to the nearest can. All for 5 cents a \nmonth.\u0014\nThe result was that I never got my 5O cents.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now he tells my children every time he comes into the house: \nWell, lets\u0014\nsee how much money old Granddad has got for his wonderful kids. And \nthe\u0014\nminute they take money out of his hands I call them over to me and I \nsnatch\u0014\nit away from them. Because that is MY money.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other story that Cosby tells that I like is the difference between\u0014\nMothers Day and Fathers Day. He insists that Mothers Day is a much \nbigger\u0014\ndeal because Mothers are more organized. Mothers say to their \nchildren: Now\u0014\nhere is a list of what I want. Go get the money from your father and \nyou\u0014\nsurprise me on Mothers Day. You do that for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Fathers Day I give each of my five kids $20 so that they can go \nout and\u0014\nby me a present--a total of $100. They go to the store and buy two \npackages\u0014\nof underwear, each of which costs $5 and contains three shorts. They \ntear\u0014\nthem open and each kid wraps up one pair, the sixth pair of underwear \ngoing\u0014\nto the Salvation Army. Therefore, on Fathers Day I am walking around \nwith\u0014\nnew underwear and my kids are walking around with $90 worth of my \nchange in\u0014\ntheir pockets.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, of course, Fathers Day is technically not a religious holiday, \nit is\u0014\na secular day. But, it is not, for that reason, less appropriate for \nus to\u0014\nrecognize it. We also dont simply want to give equal billing to \nfathers\u0014\nthis morning because we gave homage to mothers a month ago. We want to\u0014\nrecognize dads for another very important reason. The message that is \ngoing\u0014\nout to so much of society today is that fathers are simply not \nneeded. While\u0014\nthe number may numerically be small, there are some women who \nactually chose\u0014\nto be single parent mothers. But there are far too many men in \nAmerica today\u0014\nwho father children that they have no intention of raising. The \nchurch,\u0014\ntherefore, needs to send out the message loud and clear that fathers \nplay a\u0014\ncritical role in the life of the family. Fathers will have a powerful\u0014\nimpact upon their families if they connect in three crucial areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the role of the father is to connect with his God\u0014\nSecond, the role of a father is to connect with his family\u0014\nThird, the role of the father is to connect with his church\u0014",

Take for example the\u0014\n                  50th anniversary of Nasrullah's first season in \nNorth America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The son of Nearco arrived from Ireland with star \nstatus for the 1951 breeding\u0014\n                  season and did nothing to dispel that image during \nhis nine seasons at the\u0014\n                  Hancock family's Claiborne Farm near Paris, Ky. \nNasrullah went on to sire a\u0014\n                  then-record 98 stakes winners, and today his name \ncontinues to evoke memories\u0014\n                  of breeding and racing at the highest levels.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Male descendants Secretariat, Bold Ruler, Nashua, \nNever Bend, Seattle Slew, Mill\u0014\n                  Reef, and Blushing Groom, to name just a few, have \nseen to that. More than\u0014\n                  anything, Nasrullah supplied a new source of speed \nto the North American\u0014\n                  racehorse, and his blood, along with that of fellow \nClaiborne stallion Princequillo,\u0014\n                  provided an unbeatable combination.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The syndicate that purchased Nasrullah for $340,000 \nfrom Irish breeder Joe\u0014\n                  McGrath read like a Who's Who, so it came as no \nsurprise Nasrullah enjoyed the\u0014\n                  benefit of covering a host of top broodmares. The \nlist of syndicate members not\u0014\n                  only consisted of Arthur B. (Bull) Hancock Jr., who \nnegotiated the deal, and his\u0014\n                  father, Arthur B. Hancock Sr., but William Woodward \nSr. of Belair Stud, John D.\u0014\n                  Hertz, Harry F. Guggenheim, J.S. Phipps, Henry \nCarnegie Phipps of Wheatley\u0014\n                  Stable, Marion du Pont Scott, George D. Widener of \nErdenheim Farm, Charlton\u0014\n                  Clay, Howell E. Jackson, J.T. de Blois Wack, Dr. \nEslie Asbury, Thomas M. Girdler,\u0014\n                  and Clifford Mooers. McGrath, who operated \nNasrullah's former home, Brownstown\u0014\n                  Stud, also retained a breeding right.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The deal to stand Nasrullah at Claiborne was \nannounced in the fall of 1949 and\u0014\n                  called for him to stand the 1950 season at \nBrownstown, after which he would be on\u0014\n                  his way to the famed Kentucky nursery. Nasrullah, \nwho was a major winner in\u0014\n                  England for breeder/owner the Aga Khan, ranked \nthird on the 1949 English/Irish\u0014\n                  sire list and was seventh in 1950 before heading \nthe list in 1951. His reputation on\u0014\n                  these shores underwent a sizable boost in 1950 when \na runner from an overseas\u0014\n                  crop, Noor, defeated the great Citation in four \nconsecutive California stakes and\u0014\n                  was named champion older male that year. Noor also \ntook home the title of the\u0014\n                  year's leading money earner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  For Bull Hancock, the purchase of Nasrullah was a \ndream come true, the same\u0014\n                  way it had been when his father bought French \nimport Sir Gallahad III in the\u0014\n                  mid-1920s for a breeding syndicate. Sir Gallahad \nIII, whose first crop included\u0014\n                  Belair homebred Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox, \ndeveloped into a leading sire\u0014\n                  and broodmare sire. The younger Hancock had tried \ntwice before to buy Nasrullah,\u0014\n                  but the deals fell through.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah's first North American crop of foals \narrived in 1952, when he was 12, and\u0014\n                  numbered 32. Viewed as precious commodities, they \nlargely remained in the\u0014\n                  hands of their breeders. Only two sold as yearlings \nat auction, and they\u0014\n                  commanded $17,500 and $16,500 at the Keeneland \nsummer sale, well above the\u0014\n                  vendue's $9,746 average. (McGrath's Nasrullah \noffspring, a filly named Araby, was\u0014\n                  foaled overseas and is included in the 32.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah, who was produced from the Blenheim II \nmare Mumtaz Begum, posted a\u0014\n                  remarkable 25% stakes winners from foals from his \nfirst crop. His eight stakes\u0014\n                  winners were led by millionaire Nashua, with Delta \n(later a Kentucky Broodmare of\u0014\n                  the Year), Flying Fury, Blue Ruler, Insouciant, Lea \nLane, Jean's Joe, and\u0014\n                  Independence rounding out the field. Two others, \nincluding Courtesy, were\u0014\n                  stakes-placed. Courtesy later gained fame as the \ndam of three stakes winners and\u0014\n                  as the third dam of champions Swale and Forty \nNiner. Another daughter, Natasha,\u0014\n                  produced major stakes winner Natashka, a future \nKentucky Broodmare of the Year.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  RACING'S SECOND MILLIONAIRE\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nashua was bred by Belair Stud, and was intended to \nbe sent to England to trainer\u0014\n                  Cecil Boyd-Rochfort. Belair owner Woodward was a \nkeen follower of English racing\u0014\n                  and hoped Nashua might prove good enough to became \nhis first Epsom Derby\u0014\n                  winner. Woodward unfortunately died when Nashua was \na yearling, and the colt\u0014\n                  remained in the U.S. to race for Woodward's son, \nWilliam Woodward Jr., under the\u0014\n                  care of trainer James (Sunny Jim) Fitzsimmons.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Sound as a board and precocious enough to equal a \nsix-furlong track record at\u0014\n                  Belmont Park as a 2-year-old, Nashua was \nNasrullah's leading money-earner at\u0014\n                  ages two, three, and four, and the nation's leading \nearner as a 3-year-old. Those\u0014\n                  earnings went a long way in Nasrullah topping the \nsires of 2-year-olds list by\u0014\n                  progeny earnings in 1954 and the general sire list \nin 1955-56.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah achieved a bit of stardom when three of \nhis colts -- Nashua, Jean's Joe,\u0014\n                  and Flying Fury -- lined up in the field of 10 for \nthe 1955 Kentucky Derby. Nashua,\u0014\n                  the 6-5 favorite, gave it his best shot, but \ncouldn't overtake second-choice Swaps in\u0014\n                  the stretch and finished second. Jean's Joe and \nFlying Fury never threatened and\u0014\n                  ran fifth and sixth, respectively.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nashua rebounded to win the Preakness (in \ntrack-record time) and Belmont\u0014\n                  Stakes, both in the absence of Swaps, then took the \nDwyer Stakes and Arlington\u0014\n                  Classic in the summer. Sale time rolled around at \nKeeneland in late July, and for\u0014\n                  the second consecutive year, Nasrullah led by \naverage and was represented by the\u0014\n                  sale topper. (The 1954 sale topper, a colt out of \nLurline B., brought a record\u0014\n                  $86,000. The price eclipsed the former mark of \n$75,000 for the Whisk Broom II colt\u0014\n                  New Broom in 1928.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                  A month later, all eyes were back on Nashua and \nSwaps and their well-publicized\u0014\n                  match race at Washington Park in Chicago. Under \nEddie Arcaro, Nashua scored by\u0014\n                  6 1/2 lengths in what would be their final meeting. \nNashua closed out the year with\u0014\n                  a fall triumph in the two-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup \nagainst older runners and was\u0014\n                  an easy choice for Horse of the Year and champion \n3-year-old male.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The year 1955 was a time of change for Nashua away \nfrom the racetrack. The\u0014\n                  younger Woodward had died, and Nashua was put up \nfor sale in late fall. On behalf\u0014\n                  of a syndicate, Leslie Combs II of Spendthrift Farm \nbid a record $1,251,200 and\u0014\n                  announced Nashua would run at four.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Remaining with Fitzsimmons, Nashua won six stakes, \nclosing out his career with\u0014\n                  another score in the Jockey Club Gold Cup (in track \nrecord time). He entered stud                                    at \nSpendthrift as racing's all-time money earner, having earned \n$1,288,565.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Unlike Nasrullah, Nashua transmitted more stamina \nthan speed to a pedigree,\u0014\n                  justified perhaps by the influence of his \u0014\n                  maternal grandsire, Kentucky Derby and Belmont \nStakes winner Johnstown.\u0014\n                  Nonetheless, Nashua, a member of the Racing Hall of \nFame, achieved status as a\u0014\n                  major stallion, siring 77 stakes winners. Two of \nhis daughters, Bramalea and\u0014\n                  Shuvee, won the Coaching Club American Oaks at 1 \n1/4 miles, and the latter also\u0014\n                  took consecutive runnings of the Jockey Club Gold \nCup. Nashua's name remains\u0014\n                  prominent in breeding circles as a broodmare sire. \nBramalea went on to foal\u0014\n                  Epsom Derby winner and major sire Roberto and \nanother of Nashua's daughters,\u0014\n                  Gold Digger, produced leading sire Mr. Prospector.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  DEEP BENCH\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah's collection of good 2-year-olds of 1954 \nwent far beyond Nashua.\u0014\n                  Nashua, who was voted champion 2-year-old male over \nSummer Tan, never was\u0014\n                  tested beyond 6 1/2 furlongs at that age, but \nFlying Fury was. Bred by Harry F.\u0014\n                  Guggenheim and raced by his Cain Hoy Stable, Flying \nFury won the mile\u0014\n                  Champagne Stakes, and placed in the Pimlico \nFuturity and Garden State Stakes,\u0014\n                  both at 1 1/16 miles.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  As a 3-year-old, Flying Fury was tested prior to \nthe Kentucky Derby in the Derby Trial\u0014\n                  at Churchill Downs and came away with his lone \nstakes win as a 3-year-old. The\u0014\n                  following year, Flying Fury showed a likeness for \ndistance in winning the 1 1/2-mile\u0014\n                  Manhattan Handicap at Belmont Park and finishing \nsecond in the 1 3/4-mile\u0014\n                  Merchants' and Citizens' Handicap at Saratoga. At \nstud, he sired seven stakes\u0014\n                  winners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Blue Ruler, another Nasrullah colt, made a name for \nhimself in California. Bred by\u0014\n                  Claiborne and raced by Murcain Stable, Blue Ruler \ncaptured the Del Mar Futurity\u0014\n                  and Starlet Stakes as a 2-year-old, and was \nassigned the fourth-highest weight,\u0014\n                  123 pounds, on the Experimental Free Handicap. The \nfollowing year, he placed in\u0014\n                  the Santa Anita Derby and Berkeley Handicap. He \ndied in 1956.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah's fillies were led by Delta and Lea Lane, \nwho battled each other for\u0014\n                  2-year-old supremacy in the Chicago area. A \nClaiborne homebred, Delta faced Lea\u0014\n                  Lane in the Arlington Lassie and Princess Pat \nStakes and won both times. She\u0014\n                  also ran second against males in the Arlington \nFuturity. Her earnings for the year,\u0014\n                  $163,890, were only about $4,000 less than what \n2-year-old filly leader High\u0014\n                  Voltage earned.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Away from her rival that year, Lea Lane captured \nthe Pollyanna, Durazna, and Miss\u0014\n                  America Stakes, the last-named in \ntrack-record-equaling time. A homebred for\u0014\n                  Charlton Clay, Lea Lane raced only four times \nfollowing her juvenile season. As a\u0014\n                  broodmare, she produced stakes winner Rose Bower \nand is the third dam of major\u0014\n                  sire Miswaki.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Delta went on to compete at ages three and four, \nwinning a dozen of 26 starts those\u0014\n                  two years, including four stakes as a 4-year-old. \nShe produced stakes winners\u0014\n                  Dike, Canal, Cabildo, Okavango, and Shore, and was \nnamed 1968 Kentucky\u0014\n                  Broodmare of the Year.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the spring of 1955, three of Nasrullah's \ndaughters put on a show in front of the\u0014\n                  home folks in the Ashland Stakes for 3-year-old \nfillies at Keeneland near Lexington.\u0014\n                  Dr. Eslie Asbury's homebred Insouciant finished \nfirst, followed by Claiborne\u0014\n                  homebred Courtesy, then Lea Lane. Insouciant also \nwon that year's Coronet\u0014\n                  Stakes and Modesty Handicap. Her success as a \nbroodmare was modest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  That wasn't the case with Courtesy. Courtesy \nproduced the stakes-winning full\u0014\n                  siblings Knightly Manner, Dignitas, and Respected \n(by Claiborne stallion Round\u0014\n                  Table), and continues to command respect as the \nthird dam of Swale and Forty\u0014\n                  Niner. Swale ran for a partnership that included \nClaiborne and was champion\u0014\n                  3-year-old male in 1984. His big scores in the \nClaiborne silks came in the Kentucky\u0014\n                  Derby and Belmont Stakes. He died eight days after \nthe Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Forty Niner was champion 2-year-old male of 1987 \nand just missed winning the\u0014\n                  Kentucky Derby by a neck. Retired following his \n3-year-old season with $2.7 million\u0014\n                  in earnings, Forty Niner stood at Claiborne before \nhe was sold to Japanese\u0014\n                  breeders in 1995.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Jean's Joe, who was stakes-placed three times as a \n2-year-old, did his best racing\u0014\n                  beyond that age. He won the San Felipe Handicap at \nSanta Anita his 3-year-old\u0014\n                  season, and his runner-up efforts at three came in \nthe Santa Anita Derby, Blue\u0014\n                  Grass Stakes, and Derby Trial.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah also was represented by a star \nsteeplechaser in his first crop of foals.\u0014\n                  Independence, bred by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Carnegie \nPhipps' Wheatley Stable,\u0014\n                  developed into a prominent jumper for Mrs. M.G. \nWalsh. Independence won the\u0014\n                  1961 Grand National Steeplechase Handicap at \nAqueduct and three earlier stakes\u0014\n                  for leapers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The purchase of Independence's dam, stakes winner \nMiss Disco, by the Phippses\u0014\n                  was a stroke of good fortune that would have \nlasting influence on the Wheatley\u0014\n                  breeding program. In the early 1950s, Bull Hancock \ntried to buy Miss Disco for the\u0014\n                  Claiborne operation. At the same time, he also \nattempted to buy a mare for Mrs.\u0014\n                  Phipps. Hancock eventually purchased Miss Disco, \nbut wasn't able to buy the mare\u0014\n                  intended for Mrs. Phipps. Ever the gentleman, \nHancock offered her Miss Disco, and\u0014\n                  she accepted. Two years after Independence was \nborn, Miss Disco foaled Bold\u0014\n                  Ruler at Claiborne. Bold Ruler turned out to be \nHall of Fame material and later\u0014\n                  stood at Claiborne, where he sired 82 stakes \nwinners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah's success in North America was a \ndetermining factor in the importation\u0014\n                  of other stallions tracing to Nearco in male line. \nOne of the more famous of the\u0014\n                  established imports was Nearco's son Royal Charger, \na close relative of Nasrullah.\u0014\n                  Royal Charger arrived from Ireland to begin \nstanding at Spendthrift in 1954. He\u0014\n                  sired a career total of 58 stakes winners from 369 \nfoals (16%).\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Nasrullah stood at Claiborne until his death at age \n19 on May 26, 1959.

    "words": "Friday, Aug. 17, 2001 \u0014\n\u0014\n          Faith-Based Initiative Head Leaves \u0014\n\u0014\n          WASHINGTON (AP) - The leader of President Bush's effort to \nopen government programs to religious groups is resigning after seven \nmonths of controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\n          John DiIulio, director of the White House Office of \nFaith-Based and Community Initiatives, will leave as soon as a \ntransition team can be put into place, said a White House official, \nwho spoke on condition of anonymity.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But DiIulio, a Democrat and academic, was regularly \nfrustrated by the politics of Washington as he tried to steer the \nBush initiative through Congress. He was also exhausted by his \ncommute several times a week from Philadelphia, where he is on leave \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania.\u0014\n\u0014\n          His initiative was attacked by conservatives and liberals \nalike, who for different reasons opposed sending tax dollars to \nchurches, synagogues and other religious groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Liberals opposed the initiative for fear that government \nwould wind up paying for religious activity, breaching the \nconstitutional separation between church and state.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Conservatives feared that government funding would lead to \ngovernment intrusion on churches, and that tax dollars might wind up \nwith non-mainstream religious groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n          DiIulio complained that critics were focusing on the \nextreme cases and ignoring the good work that religious people can \naccomplish. And he hit back directly at the conservative, evangelical \ncritics, saying they do not speak for the entire religious community. \n``Predominantly white, exurban, evangelical and national parachurch \nleaders, should be careful not to presume to speak for any persons \nother than themselves and their own churches,'' he said in March.\u0014\n\u0014\n          He is leaving at a critical time for the initiative.\u0014\n\u0014\n          DiIulio helped push legislation opening 10 government \nprograms to religious groups through the House, but the measure faces \na tougher time in the Senate. So far, no Democrat has been willing to \nsponsor the legislation, though Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., is \nworking on a bill.\u0014\n\u0014\n          DiIulio, 43, will be the first high-profile Bush appointee \nto leave the administration. His job pays $140,000  per year.\u0014",

Simple as that.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Point Given is here and the world has followed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Think of this Travers without him. E Dubai would be \nfavorite? Come on, E Dubai?\u0014\n                  I've watched the horse train every morning. He \noozes class but favorite for the\u0014\n                  Travers? Dollar Bill, A.P. Valentine, Volponi . . . \nall good horses but road trip\u0014\n                  attractions, theyre not. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  There is nothing else to talk about around Saratoga \nthis weekend. And they talk like\u0014\n                  it's more than just a horse. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I have a date with Point Given at 3:00 today.\"\u0014\n                  \"Is there anyway you could get us over there to \nmeet him?\"\u0014\n                  \"He has a way of staring.\"\u0014\n                  \"Have you seen his forelock? It just hangs over his \neye like James Dean.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  James Dean, I like that one. He's got the swagger. \nThe glare. The appeal. The air.\u0014\n                  All down pat. And he better because he's the one \nheadlight on racing's bus at the\u0014\n                  moment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Racing has a tough hand to play. The owners and \ntrainers will never be stars. They\u0014\n                  can be quoted or showcased but they don't literally \nplay the game. It's the same\u0014\n                  reason Bear Bryant was a cult hero but he never \nmade a cereal box. You can have\u0014\n                  one hell of conversation with Bobby Frankel but \nhe's not going to fill the seats. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The jockeys are the only stars who actually talk \nbut the average fan has trouble\u0014\n                  relating to them. First of all, they're five feet \ntall and weigh a sandwich over 100\u0014\n                  pounds. All well and good, but most of us blew past \nthat in fifth grade.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  And they ride horses. The closest thing to riding a \nThoroughbred that most average\u0014\n                  Americans have experienced is what? Driving the \ngrocery cart as a teenager? Pony\u0014\n                  rides at the cousins birthday party? Falling down \nthe steps?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  So that brings it all back to the horses. And Point \nGiven. H's the one for now. It's a\u0014\n                  good thing he has massive shoulders. It's a whole \nbig world. You can feel the\u0014\n                  desperation in people as they clamor for a piece of \nthe Big Red Train. It's like\u0014\n                  seeing a shooting star almost. They've felt this \nway before and we're left holding\u0014\n                  nothing but an old Blood-Horse magazine or a losing \nticket or a just a short\u0014\n                  glimpse of something great. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  They know Point Given will be gone before they even \ngot to know him. That's the\u0014\n                  problem with the horses. It's also the great thing. \nThe fragility is awing. We need\u0014\n                  John Henrys, Foregos, Kelsos who last entire \nchildhoods or at least entire college\u0014\n                  years. But those Victory Rides, Flanders and \nArazis were rockers just the same.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Imagine Point Given coming back to Saratoga for the \nnext five years. Now that would\u0014\n                  be something. You could compare him through his \nmaturity process. See how his\u0014\n                  demeanor changes through the years. See if his \nmuzzle goes white. See if he\u0014\n                  recognizes you or at least the place. You could \ncollect each year's programs. Hang\u0014\n                  the photos in a row on your wall. Compare the \ngrowing process of your own\u0014\n                  children to his. But then again, a lot of times, \nthe first view is the best. Enjoy it while\u0014\n                  you can.\u0014",

A new evangelistic \ntract by Ray Comfort\u0014\n                      says, \"God's promised blessings of health and \nprotection from\u0014\n                      enemies are dependent upon something we have \nforgotten\u0014\n                      aboutrighteousness.\" And World magazine \npublisher Joel Belz\u0014\n                      makes a similar argument in his latest issue:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           It's the wages we always pay for sin.  \nSometimes\u0014\n                           that payment is exacted for our own sin. \nSometimes\u0014\n                           we're called on to pay for the sin of \nothers. In this case,\u0014\n                           there's plenty of both.

    "words": "Falwell apologizes for blaming groups for attacks by terrorists \u0014\n           \u0014\n          Sep 19, 2001, Baptist Press \u0014\n\u0014\n WASHINGTON (BP)--Baptist pastor and television preacher Jerry \nFalwell has apologized for blaming abortion doctors and homosexuals, \nas well as the ACLU and People for the American Way, for the Sept.11 \nterrorist attacks on the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\n In an interview with Pat Robertson on the Sept. 13 edition of \"The \n700 Club,\" Falwell said, \"The abortionists have got to bear some \nburden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy \n40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe \nthat the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the \ngays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an \nalternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of \nthem who have tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in \ntheir face and say, 'You helped this\u0014\n happen.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n He also said the ACLU should \"take a lot of blame\" for \"throwing God \nout successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing \nGod out of the public square, out of the schools,\" according to a \ntranscript made by PAW.\u0014\n\u0014\n Falwell, senior pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, \nVa., released a written apology Sept. 17, saying his comments were \n\"insensitive, uncalled for at the time and unnecessary.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Though Falwell had been an independent Baptist most of his ministry, \nThomas Road has in recent years affiliated with the Southern Baptist \nConvention and the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I apologize that, during a week when everyone appropriately dropped \nall labels and no one was seen as liberal or conservative, Democrat \nor Republican, religious or secular, I singled out for blame certain \ngroups of Americans,\"  Falwell said. \"The only label any of us needs \nin such a terrible time of crisis is that of 'American.'\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I do not know if the horrific events of Sept. 11 are the judgment \nof God, but if they are, that judgment is on all of America -- \nincluding me and all fellow sinners -- and not on any particular \ngroup.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Falwell said he blames \"no one but the hijackers and terrorists for \nthe barbaric happenings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The day after Falwell's Sept. 13 remarks, a White House official \ncalled his comments \"inappropriate\" and said, \"The president does not \nshare those views,\" The Washington Post reported.\u0014\n\u0014\n The Christian Broadcasting Network, which is chaired by Robertson, \nissued a statement Sept. 17 in which it described Falwell's \ncontroversial comments as \"severe and harsh in tone, and, frankly, \nnot fully understood by the three hosts [including Robertson] of 'The \n700 Club.'\" The CBN statement said Robertson told Fox News he \nconsidered Falwell's remarks \"totally inappropriate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n During the Sept. 13 interview, according to the transcript, \nRobertson said, \"I totally concur,\" when Falwell cited groups he said \nshould share the blame for the airline crashes into the World Trade \nCenter in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C.\u0014\n\u0014\n The CBN statement said Robertson did not plan to say anything \nfurther on \"something that is not personally in keeping with the \nspirit of prayer and sorrow\" demonstrated by the CBN staff.\u0014",

    "words": "Focused, Not Crazy\u0014\n                         Experts Explain the Thinking of Suicide \nTerrorists\u0014\n\u0014\n                         By Andrew Giese\u0014\n                         Sept. 20 \u0014\n\u0014\n                          A new breed of terrorist has been \nintroduced to America. They are calculating, as\u0014\n                         well-trained as any soldier, and know how to \nblend in without attracting attention to their\u0014\n                         murderous intentions. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"The profile of the World Trade Center and \nPentagon terrorists differs from earlier profiles,\" says Dr. Mark \nLevy, a forensic psychiatrist at the University of California San \nFrancisco. \"These men were older, more educated, and some had wives \nand families.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n A prime example is Mohamed Atta, the 33-year-old family man who is \nsaid to have trained as a pilot for years before flying a passenger \njet into a World Trade Center skyscraper filled with office workers.\u0014\n\u0014\n In the past \"most suicide bombers were single, disenfranchised, \ndepressed and infused with a religious fervor,\" says Gregg McCrary, a \nretired FBI special agent.\u0014\n\u0014\n He points to a recent study in Israel of 74 suicide bombers, among \nwhom the average age was 22.\u0014\n\u0014\n By contrast, the estimated 19 men who hijacked and crashed four \npassenger jets last week were well-trained, focused, and often had \nyears of experience and a particular expertise. They would have \nseemed to have had much to live for.\u0014\n\u0014\n                               Not Insane; Committed\u0014\n\u0014\n While their acts were horrendous, experts agree the terrorists were \nnot \"crazy\" or insane. Insanity would imply they did not understand \nthe wrongfulness of their acts or the death and destruction that \nwould result.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"It is unlikely that any of the terrorists suffered from a serious \nmental illness,\" says Dr. Park Dietz, a former FBI agent and founder \nof the Threat Assessment Group Inc., a private forensic consulting \nfirm in Newport Beach, Calif.\u0014\n\u0014\n In fact, quite the opposite may have been true because \"in order to \nbe chosen for such a mission, [the terrorists] would need to prove \nthemselves trustworthy, reliable, and dedicated\" to a cause, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n Commitment to that cause, experts say, can be borne of personal \nexperience with terror or violence, or a feeling of being persecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Attas Change\u0014\n\u0014\n While it is not clear what motivated Atta, there are some clues \nabout his behavior and actions. Born in a rural town in Egypt, he \nappeared to have gone through some change while studying urban \nplanning at Hamburg Technical University in Germany, where he \nenrolled in 1992.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"We observed that there was a changing between '95, and '98-'99 when \nhe made his diploma,\" says Professor Dittmar Machule, Atta's thesis \nsupervisor.\u0014\n\u0014\n Machule says Atta abruptly shaved off his beard and seemed to be a \nchanged man, as if he had a split personality.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The only explanation I have now is that there was a cut in his \nbrain. It was somewhat astounding,\" Machule says. \"Of course, we all \nasked him what happened, and he explained it with trouble in his \nfamily.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Fifteen months ago, Atta came to the United States to study flight \ntraining. Patrons of a Hollywood, Fla., bar he frequented and a \nneighbor describe him as intense yet emotionless.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"He was not a nice guy, like, he wasn't friendly,\" says upstairs \nneighbor Carmen Padilla. \"He was just quiet and had no emotion \nwhatsoever, none. You can look at this person, you can feel nothing \nfrom him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                No Suicidal Symptoms\u0014\n\u0014\n While the experts can't assess why last week's hijackers, who died \nin the attacks they carried out, did what they did, the psychological \nmotivation could stem from \"rage and a sense of self-righteousness,\" \nsays Dr. Harold Bursztajn. He is co-director of the program in \npsychiatry and the law at Harvard Medical School, has profiled \nterrorists and often testifies as an expert witness in mass-murder \ntrials. \u0014\n\u0014\n These individuals do not display symptoms of those who typically \ncontemplate suicide, Bursztajn says. They are not \"depressed, \nhopeless, and helpless\" because \"their primary aim is not suicide\" \nbut the accomplishment of an awful mission, he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n Dietz adds that the terrorists took part \"in a suicide mission on \nbehalf of a cause  with the expectation of contributing to the \naccomplishment of a greater good.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n He points out that while \"the terrorist on a suicide mission seeks \nrevenge and publicity  their primary goal is political change.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n It appears that suicide is a mere consequence of their mission, and \nthe \"terrorists see themselves as soldiers willing to sacrifice \nthemselves for a higher purpose.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n McCrary, who was in the FBI for 25 years, says that because of their \nbelief system or ideology, \"most Middle Eastern religious terrorists \nbelieve that they are going on to a greater eternal reward through \ntheir actions\" and that there is some type of \"personal gain to be \nachieved through their homicidal and suicidal behavior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The ability to accept one's death \"is easiest for those who expect a \nrewarding afterlife,\" says Dietz.\u0014\n\u0014\n                               Blending Into American Society\u0014\n\u0014\n The experts also say they are not surprised the terrorists could \nlive undetected among those they wish to kill. Many of the accused \nallegedly lived and traveled in the United States for months or years.\u0014\n\u0014\n The University of California's Levy explains that some people have \nthe \"capacity to divide their consciousness\" into two separate and \noften conflicting identities. A terrorist living in America may be \nable to \"isolate behaviors\" that even they find morally reprehensible \nwhile they at the same time live in a community, have a family, and \n\"blend in as a normal person,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n Unlike a serial killer, who feels some connection to the victims, \n\"these terrorists are very impersonal; they see us as insects to be \ndestroyed,\" says Bursztajn.\u0014\n\u0014\n They are capable of killing a neighbor they know well, or a faceless \nvictim in the World Trade Center, he says. They can live among us and \nstill kill us \"just as a husband might kill his spouse and children \neven though he lives with them for years\" and shows the outside world \nno signs of violent\u0014\n intentions.\u0014\n\u0014\n Like double agents trained by a government, \"the most important \ntrait of those who can lay low for a prolonged period is a strong \naffiliation with the group to whom they are loyal,\" says Dietz.\u0014\n\u0014\n There may have been very few signs of the terrorists' intentions, \nperhaps only \"saying goodbye to loved ones and setting their affairs \nin order,\" says Dietz.\u0014\n\u0014\n McCrary adds that the terrorists would not \"telegraph their \nintentions overtly\" because of the fact that \"these offenders \nappeared to be quite disciplined.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Burstajn says the only way to spot anyone affiliated with the \nhijackers is to \"beware of those who celebrate the mass murderers and \nthose who apologize for them,\" perhaps indicating some sense of guilt \nby association.\u0014\n\u0014\n Professor Harvey Clifton of New York's Long Island University, an \nauthority on terrorist groups, believes there are more like Atta at \nlarge, quietly blending in, impossible to detect.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"He's a faceless enemy,\" Clifton said. \"There is no profile \navailable to keep individuals like this off planes, out of bars, away \nfrom hotels or in flight schools.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n ABCNEWS investigative correspondent Brian Ross contributed to this \nreport.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Copyright  2001 ABC News Internet \nVentures.\u0014",

    "title": "FOUR OF A KIND",
    "words": "Four of a Kind,  Rick Riley, Sports Illustrated, 9/24/01\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   THE HUGE rugby player, the former high school football star and \nthe onetime college baseball player were in first class, the former \nnational judo champ was in coach. On the morning of Sept. 11, at \n32,000 feet, those four men teamed up to sacrifice their lives for \nthose of perhaps thousands of others.\u0014\n    Probably about an hour into United Flight 93's scheduled trip \nfrom Newark to San Francisco, the 38 passengers aboard the Boeing 757 \nrealized they were being hijacked. The terrorists commandeered the \ncockpit, and the passengers were herded to the back of the plane.\u0014\n    Shoved together were four remarkable men who didn't much like \nbeing shoved around. One was publicist Mark Bingham, 31, who helped \nCal win the 1991 and '93 national collegiate rugby championships. Re \nwas a surfer, and in July he was carried on the horns of a bull in \nPamplona. Six-foot-five, rowdy and fearless, he once wrestled a gun \nfrom a mugger's hand late at night on a San Francisco street.\u0014\n    One was medical research company executive Tom Burnett, 38, the \nstandout quarterback for Jefferson High in Bloomington, Minn., when \nthe team went to the division championship game in 1980. That team \nrallied around Burnett every time it was in trouble.\u0014\n    One was businessman Jeremy Glick, 31, 6' 2\" and muscular, the \n1993 collegiate judo champ in the 220-pound class from the University \nof Rochester (N.Y.), a national-caliber wrestler at Saddle River \n(N.J.) Day School and an all-state soccer player. \"As long as I've \nknown him,\" says his wife, Lyz, \"he was the kind of man who never \ntried to be the hero-but always was.\"\u0014\n One was 32-year-old sales account manager Todd Beamer, who played \nmostly third base and shortstop in three seasons for Wheaton (Ill.) \nCollege.\u0014\n    The rugby player picked up an AirFone and called his mother, \nAlice Hoglan, in Sacramento to tell her he loved her. The judo champ \ncalled Lyz at her parents' house in Windham, N.Y., to say goodbye to \nher and their 12-week-old daughter, Emmy. But in the calls the \nquarterback made to his wife, Deena, in San Ramon, Calif., and in the \nconversation the baseball player had with a GTE operator, the men \nmade it clear that they'd found out that two other hijacked planes \nhad cleaved the World Trade Center towers.\u0014\n    The pieces of the puzzle started to fit. Somewhere near Cleveland \nthe passengers on Flight 93 had felt the plane take a hard turn \nsouth. They were now on course for Washington, D.C. Senator Arlen \nSpecter (R., Pa.) believes the plane might have been headed for the \nCapitol. Beamer, Bingham, Burnett and Glick must have realized their \njet was a guided missile.\u0014\n     The four apparently came up with a plan. Burnett told his wife, \n\"I know we're going to die. Some of us are going to do something \nabout it.\" He wanted to rush the hijackers.\u0014\n Nobody alive is sure about what happened next, but there's good \nreason to believe that the four stormed the cockpit. Flight 93 never \nmade it to Washington. Instead, it dived into a field 80 miles \nsoutheast of Pittsburgh. All passengers and crew perished. Nobody on \nthe ground was killed.\u0014\n     In the heart of San Francisco's largest gay neighborhood, a \nmakeshift memorial grew, bouquet by bouquet, to the rugby player who \nwas unafraid. Yeah, Bingham was gay.\u0014\n     In Windham, a peace grew inside Lyz Glick. \"I think God had this \nlarger purpose for him,\" she said. \"He was supposed to fly out the \nnight before, but couldn't. I had Emmy one month early, so Jeremy got \nto see her. You can't tell me God isn't at work there.\"\u0014\nIn Cranbury, N.J., a baby grew in Lisa Beamer, Todd's wife, their \nthird child. Hearing the report last Friday of her husband's heroics, \nLisa said, \"made my life worth living again.\"\u0014\n     In Washington, a movement grew in Congress to give the four men \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian can \nreceive.\u0014\nAt a time like this, sports are trivial. But what the best athletes \ncan do--keep their composure amid chaos, form a plan when all seems \nlost and find the guts to carry it out--may be why the Capitol isn't \na charcoal pit.\u0014\n     My 26-year-old niece, Jessica Robinson, works for Congressman \nLane Evans (D., Ill.). Jessica was in the Capitol that morning. This \nChristmas I'll get to see her smiling face.\u0014\n     I'm glad there were four guys up there I could count on.\u0014",

I want \nyou to forget everything you've ever\u0014\n                  learned about what it takes to create great \nresults. I want you to realize that nearly all\u0014\n                  operating prescriptions for creating large-scale \ncorporate change are nothing but\u0014\n                  myths. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of the Change Program: This approach comes \nwith the launch event, the tag\u0014\n                  line, and the cascading activities. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of the Burning Platform: This one says \nthat change starts only when there's a\u0014\n                  crisis that persuades \"unmotivated\" employees to \naccept the need for change. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of Stock Options: Stock options, high \nsalaries, and bonuses are incentives\u0014\n                  that grease the wheels of change. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of Fear-Driven Change: The fear of being \nleft behind, the fear of watching\u0014\n                  others win, the fear of presiding over monumental \nfailure -- all are drivers of change,\u0014\n                  we're told. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of Acquisitions: You can buy your way to \ngrowth, so it figures that you can buy\u0014\n                  your way to greatness. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of Technology-Driven Change: The \nbreakthrough that you're looking for can be\u0014\n                  achieved by using technology to leapfrog the \ncompetition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Myth of Revolution: Big change has to be \nwrenching, extreme, painful -- one big,\u0014\n                  discontinuous, shattering break. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Totally \nwrong. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Here are the facts of life about these and other \nchange myths. Companies that make\u0014\n                  the change from good to great have no name for \ntheir transformation -- and absolutely\u0014\n                  no program. They neither rant nor rave about a \ncrisis -- and they don't manufacture one\u0014\n                  where none exists. They don't \"motivate\" people -- \ntheir people are self-motivated.\u0014\n                  There's no evidence of a connection between money \nand change mastery. And fear\u0014\n                  doesn't drive change -- but it does perpetuate \nmediocrity. Nor can acquisitions provide a\u0014\n                  stimulus for greatness: Two mediocrities never make \none great company. Technology\u0014\n                  is certainly important -- but it comes into play \nonly after change has already begun. And\u0014\n                  as for the final myth, dramatic results do not come \nfrom dramatic process -- not if you\u0014\n                  want them to last, anyway. A serious revolution, \none that feels like a revolution to those\u0014\n                  going through it, is highly unlikely to bring about \na sustainable leap from being good to\u0014\n                  being great. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  These myths became clear as my research team and I \ncompleted a five-year project to\u0014\n                  determine what it takes to change a good company \ninto a great one. We systematically\u0014\n                  scoured a list of 1,435 established companies to \nfind every extraordinary case that\u0014\n                  made a leap from no-better-than-average results to \ngreat results. How great? After the\u0014\n                  leap, a company had to generate cumulative stock \nreturns that exceeded the general\u0014\n                  stock market by at least three times over 15 years \n-- and it had to be a leap independent\u0014\n                  of its industry. In fact, the 11 good-to-great \ncompanies that we found averaged returns\u0014\n                  6.9 times greater than the market's -- more than \ntwice the performance rate of General\u0014\n                  Electric under the legendary Jack Welch. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The surprising good-to-great list included such \nunheralded companies as Abbott\u0014\n                  Laboratories ( 3.98 times the market ), Fannie Mae \n( 7.56 times the market ),\u0014\n                  Kimberly-Clark Corp.( 3.42 times the market ), \nNucor Corp. ( 5.16 times the market ),\u0014\n                  and Wells Fargo ( 3.99 times the market ). One such \nsurprise, the Kroger Co. -- a\u0014\n                  grocery chain -- bumped along as a totally average \nperformer for 80 years and then\u0014\n                  somehow broke free of its mediocrity to beat the \nstock market by 4.16 times over the\u0014\n                  next 15 years. And it didn't stop there. From 1973 \nto 1998, Kroger outperformed the\u0014\n                  market by 10 times. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In each of these dramatic, remarkable, \ngood-to-great corporate transformations, we\u0014\n                  found the same thing: There was no miracle moment. \nInstead, a down-to-earth,\u0014\n                  pragmatic, committed-to-excellence process -- a \nframework -- kept each company, its\u0014\n                  leaders, and its people on track for the long haul. \nIn each case, it was the triumph of the\u0014\n                  Flywheel Effect over the Doom Loop, the victory of \nsteadfast discipline over the quick fix.\u0014\n                  And the real kicker: The comparison companies in \nour study -- firms with virtually\u0014\n                  identical opportunities during the pivotal years -- \ndid buy into the change myths\u0014\n                  described above -- and failed to make the leap from \ngood to great. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  How Change Doesn't Happen\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Picture an egg. Day after day, it sits there. No \none pays attention to it. No one notices it.\u0014\n                  Certainly no one takes a picture of it or puts it \non the cover of a celebrity-focused\u0014\n                  business magazine. Then one day, the shell cracks \nand out jumps a chicken. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  All of a sudden, the major magazines and newspapers \njump on the story: \"Stunning\u0014\n                  Turnaround at Egg!\" and \"The Chick Who Led the \nBreakthrough at Egg!\" From the\u0014\n                  outside, the story always reads like an overnight \nsensation -- as if the egg had suddenly\u0014\n                  and radically altered itself into a chicken. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Now picture the egg from the chicken's point of \nview. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  While the outside world was ignoring this seemingly \ndormant egg, the chicken within\u0014\n                  was evolving, growing, developing -- changing. From \nthe chicken's point of view, the\u0014\n                  moment of breakthrough, of cracking the egg, was \nsimply one more step in a long\u0014\n                  chain of steps that had led up to that moment. \nGranted, it was a big step -- but it was\u0014\n                  hardly the radical transformation that it looked \nlike from the outside. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  It's a silly analogy -- but then our conventional \nway of looking at change is no less silly.\u0014\n                  Everyone looks for the \"miracle moment\" when \n\"change happens.\" But ask the\u0014\n                  good-to-great executives when change happened. They \ncannot pinpoint a single key\u0014\n                  event that exemplified their successful transition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Take Walgreens. For more than 40 years, Walgreens \nwas no more than an average\u0014\n                  company, tracking the general market. Then in 1975 \n( out of the blue! ) Walgreens\u0014\n                  began to climb. And climb. And climb. It just kept \nclimbing. From December 31, 1975 to\u0014\n                  January 1, 2000, one dollar invested in Walgreens \nbeat one dollar invested in Intel by\u0014\n                  nearly 2 times, General Electric by nearly 5 times, \nand Coca-Cola by nearly 8 times. It\u0014\n                  beat the general stock market by more than 15 \ntimes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I asked a key Walgreens executive to pinpoint when \nthe good-to-great transformation\u0014\n                  happened. His answer: \"Sometime between 1971 and \n1980.\" ( Well, that certainly\u0014\n                  narrows it down! ) \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Walgreens's experience is the norm for \ngood-to-great performers. Leaders at Abbott\u0014\n                  said, \"It wasn't a blinding flash or sudden \nrevelation from above.\" From Kimberly-Clark:\u0014\n                  \"These things don't happen overnight. They grow.\" \nFrom Wells Fargo: \"It wasn't a single\u0014\n                  switch that was thrown at one time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  We keep looking for change in the wrong places, \nasking the wrong questions, and\u0014\n                  making the wrong assumptions. There's even a \ntendency to blame Wall Street for the\u0014\n                  \"instant results\" approach to change. But the \ncompanies that made the jump from good\u0014\n                  to great did so using Wall Street's own tough \nmetric of success: a sustained leap in\u0014\n                  their stock-market performance. Wall Street turns \nout to be just another myth -- an\u0014\n                  excuse for not doing what really works. The data \ndoesn't lie. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  How Change Does Happen\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Now picture a huge, heavy flywheel. It's a massive, \nmetal disk mounted horizontally on\u0014\n                  an axle. It's about 100 feet in diameter, 10 feet \nthick, and it weighs about 25 tons. That\u0014\n                  flywheel is your company. Your job is to get that \nflywheel to move as fast as possible,\u0014\n                  because momentum -- mass times velocity -- is what \nwill generate superior economic\u0014\n                  results over time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Right now, the flywheel is at a standstill. To get \nit moving, you make a tremendous\u0014\n                  effort. You push with all of your might, and \nfinally, you get the flywheel to inch forward.\u0014\n                  After two or three days of sustained effort, you \nget the flywheel to complete one entire\u0014\n                  turn. You keep pushing, and the flywheel begins to \nmove a bit faster. It takes a lot of\u0014\n                  work, but at last the flywheel makes a second \nrotation. You keep pushing steadily. It\u0014\n                  makes three turns, four turns, five, six. With each \nturn, it moves faster, and then -- at\u0014\n                  some point, you can't say exactly when -- you break \nthrough. The momentum of the\u0014\n                  heavy wheel kicks in your favor. It spins faster \nand faster, with its own weight propelling\u0014\n                  it. You aren't pushing any harder, but the flywheel \nis accelerating, its momentum\u0014\n                  building, its speed increasing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  This is the Flywheel Effect. It's what it feels \nlike when you're inside a company that\u0014\n                  makes the transition from good to great. Take \nKroger, for example. How do you get a\u0014\n                  company with more than 50,000 people to embrace a \nnew strategy that will eventually\u0014\n                  change every aspect of every grocery store? You \ndon't. At least not with one big change\u0014\n                  program. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Instead, you put your shoulder to the flywheel. \nThat's what Jim Herring, the leader who\u0014\n                  initiated the transformation of Kroger, told us. He \nstayed away from change programs\u0014\n                  and motivational stunts. He and his team began \nturning the flywheel gradually,\u0014\n                  consistently -- building tangible evidence that \ntheir plans made sense and would\u0014\n                  deliver results. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"We presented what we were doing in such a way that \npeople saw our\u0014\n                  accomplishments,\" Herring says. \"We tried to bring \nour plans to successful\u0014\n                  conclusions step by step, so that the mass of \npeople would gain confidence from the\u0014\n                  successes, not just the words.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Think about it for one minute. Why do most \noverhyped change programs ultimately fail?\u0014\n                  Because they lack accountability, they fail to \nachieve credibility, and they have no\u0014\n                  authenticity. It's the opposite of the Flywheel \nEffect; it's the Doom Loop. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Companies that fall into the Doom Loop genuinely \nwant to effect change -- but they lack\u0014\n                  the quiet discipline that produces the Flywheel \nEffect. Instead, they launch change\u0014\n                  programs with huge fanfare, hoping to \"enlist the \ntroops.\" They start down one path,\u0014\n                  only to change direction. After years of lurching \nback and forth, these companies\u0014\n                  discover that they've failed to build any sustained \nmomentum. Instead of turning the\u0014\n                  flywheel, they've fallen into a Doom Loop: \nDisappointing results lead to reaction without\u0014\n                  understanding, which leads to a new direction -- a \nnew leader, a new program -- which\u0014\n                  leads to no momentum, which leads to disappointing \nresults. It's a steady, downward\u0014\n                  spiral. Those who have experienced a Doom Loop know \nhow it drains the spirit right out\u0014\n                  of a company. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Consider the Warner-Lambert Co. -- the company that \nwe compared directly with\u0014\n                  Gillette -- in the early 1980s. In 1979, \nWarner-Lambert told Business Week that it aimed\u0014\n                  to be a leading consumer-products company. One year \nlater, it did an abrupt about-face\u0014\n                  and turned its sights on health care. In 1981, the \ncompany reversed course again and\u0014\n                  returned to diversification and consumer goods. \nThen in 1987, Warner-Lambert made\u0014\n                  another U-turn, away from consumer goods, and \nannounced that it wanted to compete\u0014\n                  with Merck. Then in the early 1990s, the company \nresponded to government\u0014\n                  announcements of pending health-care reform and \nreembraced diversification and\u0014\n                  consumer brands. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Between 1979 and 1998, Warner-Lambert underwent \nthree major restructurings -- one\u0014\n                  per CEO. Each new CEO arrived with his own program; \neach CEO halted the\u0014\n                  momentum of his predecessor. With each turn of the \nDoom Loop, the company\u0014\n                  spiraled further downward, until it was swallowed \nby Pfizer in 2000. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In contrast, why does the Flywheel Effect work? \nBecause more than anything else, real\u0014\n                  people in real companies want to be part of a \nwinning team. They want to contribute to\u0014\n                  producing real results. They want to feel the \nexcitement and the satisfaction of being\u0014\n                  part of something that just flat-out works. When \npeople begin to feel the magic of\u0014\n                  momentum -- when they begin to see tangible results \nand can feel the flywheel start to\u0014\n                  build speed -- that's when they line up, throw \ntheir shoulders to the wheel, and push. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  And that's how change really happens. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Disciplined People: \"Who\" Before \"What\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  You are a bus driver. The bus, your company, is at \na standstill, and it's your job to get it\u0014\n                  going. You have to decide where you're going, how \nyou're going to get there, and who's\u0014\n                  going with you. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Most people assume that great bus drivers ( read: \nbusiness leaders ) immediately start\u0014\n                  the journey by announcing to the people on the bus \nwhere they're going -- by setting a\u0014\n                  new direction or by articulating a fresh corporate \nvision. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In fact, leaders of companies that go from good to \ngreat start not with \"where\" but with\u0014\n                  \"who.\" They start by getting the right people on \nthe bus, the wrong people off the bus,\u0014\n                  and the right people in the right seats. And they \nstick with that discipline -- first the\u0014\n                  people, then the direction -- no matter how dire \nthe circumstances. Take David\u0014\n                  Maxwell's bus ride. When he became CEO of Fannie \nMae in 1981, the company was\u0014\n                  losing $1 million every business day, with $56 \nbillion worth of mortgage loans under\u0014\n                  water. The board desperately wanted to know what \nMaxwell was going to do to rescue\u0014\n                  the company. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Maxwell responded to the \"what\" question the same \nway that all good-to-great leaders\u0014\n                  do: He told them, That's the wrong first question. \nTo decide where to drive the bus\u0014\n                  before you have the right people on the bus, and \nthe wrong people off the bus, is\u0014\n                  absolutely the wrong approach. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Maxwell told his management team that there would \nonly be seats on the bus for A-level\u0014\n                  people who were willing to put out A-plus effort. \nHe interviewed every member of the\u0014\n                  team. He told them all the same thing: It was going \nto be a tough ride, a very\u0014\n                  demanding trip. If they didn't want to go, fine; \njust say so. Now's the time to get off the\u0014\n                  bus, he said. No questions asked, no \nrecriminations. In all, 14 of 26 executives got off\u0014\n                  the bus. They were replaced by some of the best, \nsmartest, and hardest-working\u0014\n                  executives in the world of finance. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  With the right people on the bus, in the right \nseats, Maxwell then turned his full attention\u0014\n                  to the \"what\" question. He and his team took Fannie \nMae from losing $1 million a day at\u0014\n                  the start of his tenure to earning $4 million a day \nat the end. Even after Maxwell left in\u0014\n                  1991, his great team continued to drive the \nflywheel -- turn upon turn -- and Fannie Mae\u0014\n                  generated cumulative stock returns nearly eight \ntimes better than the general market\u0014\n                  from 1984 to 1999. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  When it comes to getting started, good-to-great \nleaders understand three simple truths.\u0014\n                  First, if you begin with \"who,\" you can more easily \nadapt to a fast-changing world. If\u0014\n                  people get on your bus because of where they think \nit's going, you'll be in trouble when\u0014\n                  you get 10 miles down the road and discover that \nyou need to change direction\u0014\n                  because the world has changed. But if people board \nthe bus principally because of all\u0014\n                  the other great people on the bus, you'll be much \nfaster and smarter in responding to\u0014\n                  changing conditions. Second, if you have the right \npeople on your bus, you don't need to\u0014\n                  worry about motivating them. The right people are \nself-motivated: Nothing beats being a\u0014\n                  part of a team that is expected to produce great \nresults. And third, if you have the wrong\u0014\n                  people on the bus, nothing else matters. You may be \nheaded in the right direction, but\u0014\n                  you still won't achieve greatness. Great vision \nwith mediocre people still produces\u0014\n                  mediocre results. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Disciplined Thought: Fox or Hedgehog?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Picture two animals: a fox and a hedgehog. Which \nare you? An ancient Greek parable\u0014\n                  distinguishes between foxes, which know many small \nthings, and hedgehogs, which\u0014\n                  know one big thing. All good-to-great leaders, it \nturns out, are hedgehogs. They know\u0014\n                  how to simplify a complex world into a single, \norganizing idea -- the kind of basic\u0014\n                  principle that unifies, organizes, and guides all \ndecisions. That's not to say hedgehogs\u0014\n                  are simplistic. Like great thinkers, who take \ncomplexities and boil them down into\u0014\n                  simple, yet profound, ideas ( Adam Smith and the \ninvisible hand, Darwin and evolution\u0014\n                  ), leaders of good-to-great companies develop a \nHedgehog Concept that is simple but\u0014\n                  that reflects penetrating insight and deep \nunderstanding. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  What does it take to come up with a Hedgehog \nConcept for your company? Start by\u0014\n                  confronting the brutal facts. One good-to-great CEO \nbegan by asking, \"Why have we\u0014\n                  sucked for 100 years?\" That's brutal -- and it's \nprecisely the type of disciplined question\u0014\n                  necessary to ignite a transformation. The \nmanagement climate during a leap from good\u0014\n                  to great is like a searing scientific debate -- \nwith smart, tough-minded people\u0014\n                  examining hard facts and debating what those facts \nmean. The point isn't to win the\u0014\n                  debate, but rather to come up with the best answers \n-- and, ultimately, to lock onto a\u0014\n                  Hedgehog Concept that works. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  You'll know that you're getting closer to your \nHedgehog Concept when you align three\u0014\n                  intersecting circles that represent three pivotal \nquestions: What can we be the best in\u0014\n                  the world at? ( And equally important -- what can \nwe not be the best at? ) What is the\u0014\n                  economic denominator that best drives our economic \nengine ( profit or cash flow per \"x\"\u0014\n                  )? And what are our core people deeply passionate \nabout? Answer those three\u0014\n                  questions honestly, facing the brutal facts without \nblinking, and you'll begin to see your\u0014\n                  Hedgehog Concept emerge. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  For example, before Wells Fargo understood its \nHedgehog Concept, its leaders had\u0014\n                  tried to make it a global bank: It operated like a \nmini-Citicorp -- and a mediocre one at\u0014\n                  that. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Then the Wells Fargo team asked itself, \"What can \nwe potentially do better than any\u0014\n                  other company?\" The brutal fact was that Wells \nFargo would never be the best global\u0014\n                  bank in the world -- and so the leadership team \npulled the plug on the vast majority of\u0014\n                  the bank's international operations. When the team \nasked that question about the\u0014\n                  bank's economic engine, Wells Fargo's leaders \nconfronted a second brutal fact: In a\u0014\n                  deregulated world, commercial banking would be a \ncommodity. The essential\u0014\n                  economic driver would no longer be profit per loan, \nbut profit per employee. The bank\u0014\n                  switched its operations to become a pioneering \nleader in electronic banking and to\u0014\n                  open utilitarian branches run by small crews of \nsuperb people. Profit per employee\u0014\n                  skyrocketed. Finally, when it came to passion, \nmembers of the Wells Fargo team all\u0014\n                  agreed: The mindless waste and self-awarded perks \nof traditional banking culture were\u0014\n                  revolting. They proudly saw themselves as stoic \nSpartans in an industry that had been\u0014\n                  dominated by the wasteful, elitist culture of \nbanking. The Wells Fargo team eventually\u0014\n                  translated the three circles into a simple, \ncrystalline Hedgehog Concept: Run a bank\u0014\n                  like a business, with a focus on the western United \nStates, and consistently increase\u0014\n                  profit per employee. \"Run it like a business\" and \n\"run it like you own it\" became\u0014\n                  mantras; simplicity and focus made all the \ndifference. With fanatical adherence to that\u0014\n                  simple idea, Wells Fargo made the leap from good \nresults to superior results. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the journey from good to great, defining your \nHedgehog Concept is an essential\u0014\n                  element. But insight and understanding don't happen \novernight -- or after one off-site.\u0014\n                  On average, it took four years for the \ngood-to-great companies to crystallize their\u0014\n                  Hedgehog Concepts. It was an inherently iterative \nprocess -- consisting of piercing\u0014\n                  questions, vigorous debate, resolute action, and \nautopsies without blame -- a cycle\u0014\n                  repeated over and over by the right people, infused \nwith the brutal facts, and guided by\u0014\n                  the three circles. This is the chicken inside the \negg. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Disciplined Action: The \"Stop Doing\" List \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Take a look at your desk. If you're like most \nhard-charging leaders, you've got a\u0014\n                  well-articulated to-do list. Now take another look: \nWhere's your stop-doing list? We've all\u0014\n                  been told that leaders make things happen -- and \nthat's true: Pushing that flywheel\u0014\n                  takes a lot of concerted effort. But it's also true \nthat good-to-great leaders distinguish\u0014\n                  themselves by their unyielding discipline to stop \ndoing anything and everything that\u0014\n                  doesn't fit tightly within their Hedgehog Concept. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  When Darwin Smith and his management team \ncrystallized the Hedgehog Concept for\u0014\n                  Kimberly-Clark, they faced a dilemma. On one hand, \nthey understood that the best path\u0014\n                  to greatness lay in the consumer business, where \nthe company had demonstrated a\u0014\n                  best-in-the-world capability in its building of the \nKleenex brand. On the other hand, the\u0014\n                  vast majority of Kimberly-Clark's revenue lay in \ntraditional coated-paper mills, turning\u0014\n                  out paper for magazines and writing pads -- which \nhad been the core business of the\u0014\n                  company for 100 years. Even the company's namesake \ntown -- Kimberly, Wisconsin --\u0014\n                  was built around a Kimberly-Clark paper mill. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Yet the brutal truth remained: The consumer \nbusiness was the one arena that best met\u0014\n                  the three-circle test. If Kimberly-Clark remained \nprincipally a paper-mill business, it\u0014\n                  would retain a secure position as a good company. \nBut its only shot at becoming a\u0014\n                  great company was to become the best paper-based \nconsumer company -- if it could\u0014\n                  take on such companies as Procter & Gamble and \nScott Paper Co. and beat them. That\u0014\n                  meant it would have to \"stop doing\" paper mills. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  So, in what one director called \"the gutsiest \ndecision I've ever seen a CEO make,\"\u0014\n                  Darwin Smith sold the mills. He even sold the mill \nin Kimberly, Wisconsin. Then he\u0014\n                  threw all the money into a war chest for an epic \nbattle with Procter & Gamble and Scott\u0014\n                  Paper. Wall Street analysts derided the move, and \nthe business press called it stupid.\u0014\n                  But Smith did not waver. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Twenty-five years later, Kimberly-Clark emerged \nfrom the fray as the number-one\u0014\n                  paper-based consumer-products company in the world, \nbeating P&G in six of eight\u0014\n                  categories and owning its former archrival Scott \nPaper outright. For the shareholder,\u0014\n                  Kimberly-Clark under Darwin Smith beat the market \nby four times, easily outperforming\u0014\n                  such great companies as Coca-Cola, General \nElectric, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In deciding what not to do, Smith gave the flywheel \na gigantic push -- but it was only one\u0014\n                  push. After selling the mills, Kimberly-Clark's \nfull transformation required thousands of\u0014\n                  additional pushes, big and small, accumulated one \nafter another. It took years to gain\u0014\n                  enough momentum for the press to herald \nKimberly-Clark's shift from good to great.\u0014\n                  One magazine wrote, \"When ... Kimberly-Clark \ndecided to go head to head against P&G\u0014\n                  ... this magazine predicted disaster. What a dumb \nidea. As it turns out, it wasn't a dumb\u0014\n                  idea. It was a smart idea.\" The amount of time \nbetween the two articles: 21 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Now It Begins\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Our study of what it takes to turn good into great \nrequired 5 years -- and 10.5\u0014\n                  person-years -- and amounted to our own flywheel \neffort. Looking back on our research,\u0014\n                  what's most striking to me about our findings is \nthe absence of a magic moment in any\u0014\n                  of the good-to-great companies -- or in our own \njourney to understanding. The real path\u0014\n                  to greatness, it turns out, requires simplicity and \ndiligence. It requires clarity, not instant\u0014\n                  illumination. It demands each of us to focus on \nwhat is vital -- and to eliminate all of the\u0014\n                  extraneous distractions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  After five years of research, I'm absolutely \nconvinced that if we just focus our attention on\u0014\n                  the right things -- and stop doing the senseless \nthings that consume so much time and\u0014\n                  energy -- we can create a powerful Flywheel Effect \nwithout increasing the number of\u0014\n                  hours we work. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I'm also convinced that the good-to-great findings \napply broadly -- not just to CEOs, but\u0014\n                  also to you and me in whatever work we're engaged \nin, including the work of our own\u0014\n                  lives. For many people, the first question that \noccurs is, \"But how do I persuade my CEO\u0014\n                  to get it?\" My answer: Don't worry about that. \nFocus instead on results -- on subverting\u0014\n                  mediocrity by creating a Flywheel Effect within \nyour own span of responsibility. So long\u0014\n                  as we can choose the people we want to put on our \nown minibus, each of us can create\u0014\n                  a pocket of greatness. Each of us can take our own \narea of work and influence and can\u0014\n                  concentrate on moving it from good to great. It \ndoesn't really matter whether all the\u0014\n                  CEOs get it. It only matters that you and I do. \nNow, it's time to get to work. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Jim Collins ( jimcollins@aol.com ) wrote the essay \nBuilt to Flip in the March 2000 issue\u0014\n                  of Fast Company. His new book, Good to Great: Why \nSome Companies Make the Leap\u0014\n                  ... And Others Don't, will be available in October. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Sidebar: Separating the Good From the Great\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Can a good company become a great company? How? It \ntook Jim Collins and his team\u0014\n                  of researchers 5 years to come up with the answers: \n11 companies made the leap\u0014\n                  from good to great and then sustained those results \nfor at least 15 years. How great\u0014\n                  was great? The good-to-great companies averaged \ncumulative stock returns 6.9 times\u0014\n                  the general market in the 15 years after their \ntransition points. The actual\u0014\n                  screening-and-selection process was a rigorous one. \nThe criteria were: \u0014\n\u0014\n                  1. The company had to show a pattern of good \nperformance, punctuated by a transition\u0014\n                  point, after which it shifted to great performance. \n\"Great performance\" was defined as a\u0014\n                  cumulative total stock return of at least three \ntimes the general market for the period\u0014\n                  from the transition point through 15 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  2. The transition from good to great had to be \ncompany specific, not an industrywide\u0014\n                  event. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  3. The company had to be an established and ongoing \nenterprise -- not a startup. It had\u0014\n                  to have been in business for at least 25 years \nprior to its transition, and it had to have\u0014\n                  been publicly traded with stock-return data \navailable for at least 10 years prior to its\u0014\n                  transition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  4. The transition point had to occur before 1985 to \ngive the team enough data to assess\u0014\n                  the sustainability of the transition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  5. Whatever the year of transition, the company had \nto be a significant, ongoing,\u0014\n                  stand-alone company. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  6. At the time of its selection, the company still \nhad to show an upward trend. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The study began with a field of 1,435 companies and \nemerged with a list of 11\u0014\n                  good-to-great companies: Abbott Laboratories, \nCircuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette Co.,\u0014\n                  Kimberly-Clark Corp., the Kroger Co., Nucor Corp., \nPhilip Morris Cos. Inc., Pitney Bowes\u0014\n                  Inc., Walgreens, and Wells Fargo.\u0014",

    "words": "Final words from Flight 93 \u0014\n                      Family members share the painful calls from \nthe  passengers who fought back\u0014\n\u0014\n                      BY ANGIE CANNON \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That Tuesday morning, Todd Beamer's alarm rang \nat 5:45 a.m. His wife, Lisa, pulled a\u0014\n                      pillow over her head. The Oracle account \nmanager had to fly to San Francisco for a\u0014\n                      meeting at the software company. Normally, he \nwould have left the night before, but\u0014\n                      on Monday, the couple had returned to their New \nJersey home from a weeklong\u0014\n                      company trip to Italy, and Beamer wanted some \ntime with 3-year-old David and\u0014\n                      1-year-old Andrew. So he decided to take United \nFlight 93 the next daySeptember 11.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In all, 37 passengers boarded the plane at \nNewark International  Airport's Gate 17\u0014\n                      that bright, beautiful morning. Thirty-three \nwere headed to the West Coast for business\u0014\n                      meetings or vacationsor simply returning home. \nFour had a different agenda. Carrying\u0014\n                      knives, a quartet of hijackers took control of \nthe plane in midair and began\u0014\n                      steering it toward another \ndestinationauthorities have said the White House or the\u0014\n                      Capitol were likely targets. Exactly what \nhappened on Flight 93 may never be known.\u0014\n                      Tapes from the cockpit voice recorder are still \nbeing examined. As of now, the best\u0014\n                      account of the heroes onboard comes from phone \ncalls passengers made to family\u0014\n                      members, who shared their memories with U.S. \nNews.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Timing is everything, they say, and timing was \npart of what foiled the hijackers. The\u0014\n                      Boeing 757 was to depart Newark International \nat 8 a.m. It pulled away from the gate\u0014\n                      at 8:01, then sat on the tarmac for more than \n40 minutes because of heavy traffic. It\u0014\n                      finally took off at 8:43 a.m. Because of the \ndelay, passengers learned of the World\u0014\n                      Trade Center and Pentagon attacks in the midst \nof their own crisisand then made\u0014\n                      their own fateful decisions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Play to win. In the world of airplane travel, \npassengers who start a flight as\u0014\n                      strangers usually end up that way, too. But the \nextraordinary circumstances of Flight\u0014\n                      93 changed that. Passengers and crew members \njoined together and fought back.\u0014\n                      In-flight phone calls point to at least five \nmen as key players. They were big men,\u0014\n                      strong men, men who loved sports. Beamer, 32, 6 \nfeet tall and 200 pounds, was a\u0014\n                      basketball and softball enthusiast. \"He was \nhumble,\" his wife says. \"But he was very\u0014\n                      competitive. Winning was important to him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In seat 4D was Mark Bingham, 31, 6-foot-5 and \n220 pounds, a public-relations\u0014\n                      executive who played on his college rugby team, \nran with the bulls in Pamplona this\u0014\n                      summer (and got gored), and once wrested a gun \nfrom a mugger. He was fiercely\u0014\n                      competitive, even in a game of Scrabble. \"He \nhad no fear,\" says Paul Holm, his former\u0014\n                      domestic partner of six years and a friend. \n\"And he had to win.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Next to him was Tom Burnett, 38, chief \noperating officer of medical-device maker\u0014\n                      Thoratec. The father of three small girls, \nBurnett was a hockey player and onetime\u0014\n                      high school quarterback. A friend describes him \nas \"exceptionally bright, driven, and\u0014\n                      competitive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jeremy Glick, 31, a salesman for a San \nFrancisco Internet firm, sat in coach. Six-foot-1\u0014\n                      and 220 pounds, he skied and golfed, wrestled \nand practiced judo. \"He was very\u0014\n                      competitive, but he channeled his \naggressiveness into sports and business,\" says his\u0014\n                      father-in-law, Richard Makely. \"Once he was \nhome, he was a very gentle person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Behind him was Lou Nacke, 42, manager of a \ntoy-store distribution center. The\u0014\n                      shortest of the five at 5-foot-9, the 200-pound \nweightlifter had a Superman logo\u0014\n                      tattooed on his left arm. \"He wasn't one to \ntalk about how super he was, he just\u0014\n                      showed you,\" says Jeff Trichon, his \nbrother-in-law. \"He was a man of strength and\u0014\n                      steel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For 45 minutes or so, the plane flew west \nacross Pennsylvania toward Cleveland. At\u0014\n                      9:35 a.m., the 757 abruptly made a U-turn and \nbegan heading toward Washington.\u0014\n                      Passengers grabbed for cellphones and in-seat \nphones. Between 9:31 a.m. to 9:53\u0014\n                      a.m, 24 calls were made from the GTE Airfones.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Shortly before 9:45, Jeremy Glick called his \nwife of five years, Lyzbeth. In high school,\u0014\n                      she was prom queen to his king. He told her he \nloved her. Then he told her about\u0014\n                      \"these bad terrorists.\" Another passenger, he \nsaid, had heard about other terrorist\u0014\n                      attacks during a call. Was it true? Lyzbeth \ntold him about the World Trade Center. The\u0014\n                      hijackers had said they would get to their \ntarget or blow up the plane. Glick wanted\u0014\n                      advice: Should they rush the hijackers or not?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At 9:45, Todd Beamer told GTE supervisor Lisa \nJefferson that 27 passengers had\u0014\n                      been herded to seats in the rear, while some \nremained in first class. Two hijackers\u0014\n                      were in the cockpit; a third was guarding \npassengers. The five flight attendants were\u0014\n                      scattered. One attendant told Beamer two people \nwere on the floor in first class,\u0014\n                      possibly the pilot and copilot. She wasn't sure \nif they were dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In shock. Women fought back, too. At 9:45, \nflight attendant Sandy Bradshaw, 38,\u0014\n                      called her home in Greensboro, N.C. \"She said \nher flight had been hijacked by guys\u0014\n                      with knives,\" says her husband, Phil, a pilot. \n\"She said, 'We are here in the back trying\u0014\n                      to get hot water to throw on them. Do you have \nany other ideas?' I said, 'Go with that.'\u0014\n                      I was in shock. She sounded calm, but like her \nadrenaline was really going.\" She\u0014\n                      promised if she survived she would quit and \nstay home with 1-year-old Nathan,\u0014\n                      Alexandria, almost 3, and Shenan, 16.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At 9:45, Mark Bingham called his mother, Alice \nHoglan. It struck her as odd that he\u0014\n                      said: \"This is Mark Bingham.\" He told her: \"In \ncase I don't see you again, I love you all. It\u0014\n                      doesn't look good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tom Burnett called his wife, Deena, saying they \nwere getting ready to do something. \"I\u0014\n                      said, 'Who?' and he said, 'A group of us.' I \npleaded with him to please sit down and not\u0014\n                      draw any attention to himself,\" she has told \nreporters. His last words to her: \"No, if\u0014\n                      they were going to run this into the ground, we \nare going to do something.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Halfway through his 15-minute call to GTE \nsupervisor Jefferson, Todd Beamer said the\u0014\n                      plane was flying erratically. He made Lisa \nJefferson promise to call his family to tell\u0014\n                      them how much he loved them. He asked her to \nsay the Lord's Prayer with him. He\u0014\n                      said several men were going to take on the \nhijackers. \"Are you sure that's what you\u0014\n                      want to do?\" Jefferson asked. \"Yes,\" he replied.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At 9:56 a.m., Flight 93 asked the Federal \nAviation Administration to change its\u0014\n                      destination to Reagan National Airport in \nWashington. A minute later, the FAA\u0014\n                      approved, according to Flight Explorer, a firm \nthat tracks such communications.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During his 15-minute call, Jeremy Glick told \nhis wife that they had taken a vote and\u0014\n                      they were going after the terrorists. He told \nher he loved her. \"Hold the phone, and I'll\u0014\n                      be back,\" he said. She couldn't bear it and \nhanded the phone to her father. \"I heard\u0014\n                      two sets of screams,\" Richard Makely recalls. \n\"I presumed the first set was taking\u0014\n                      place when they attacked the people. They were \nrushing the cockpit. It was a chorus\u0014\n                      of screams and yells. And then, there was a \nsecond set a minute or so later. It was a\u0014\n                      little after 10.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lisa Jefferson heard Todd Beamer say, \"Are you \nguys ready? Let's roll.\" He put the\u0014\n                      phone down. She heard commotion. No one \nreturned to the phone. She stayed on until\u0014\n                      the line went dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Minutes before the crash, Eric Peterson of \nLambertsville, Pa., saw the 757 flying\u0014\n                      extremely low, maybe 300 feet from the ground. \nIt suddenly careened downward.\u0014\n                      \"We could see more of the top side of the plane \nthan the underside,\" he said. It's\u0014\n                      unclear who was at the controls. At 10:10 a.m., \nthe plane went down in the green\u0014\n                      grass of an inactive strip mine in Shanksville, \nPa., leaving a vast black crater.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thirteen days after the crash, President Bush \ninvited the Flight 93 families to the White\u0014\n                      House. The event wasn't heavily publicized. In \nthe East Room, Bush said the plane\u0014\n                      could have been gunning for the White House. He \nand his wife spent time with each\u0014\n                      family. \"He hugged me and shook hands,\" says \nRobert Weisberg, Lou Nacke's\u0014\n                      father-in-law. \"He was very emotional.\" About \n100 staffers lined a hallway. They\u0014\n                      thanked the families for their lives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lisa Beamer has received many calls and letters \nfrom people who feel indebted to the\u0014\n                      Flight 93 heroes. A woman whose eighth-grade \nson was on a field trip to the White\u0014\n                      House told her \"she owed Todd and the other \npassengers because her son was still\u0014\n                      alive.\" That's a comfort. \"Even if my life is \nstill really bad right now,\" Beamer says,\u0014\n                      \"someone else's life isn't because of what Todd \nand the other passengers did. They\u0014\n                      acted courageously and showed they were people \nof character even under the most\u0014\n                      difficult circumstances. It is something for us \nall to look to and strive for, not just in\u0014\n                      times of trial, but all the time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor will Beamer herself give in to fear. \nPregnant with a third child, she flew United's\u0014\n                      Newark-to-San Francisco flight last weeknow \ncalled Flight 81for a meeting to set up\u0014\n                      a foundation in Todd's name. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With Janet Rae-Dupree, Suzie Larsen, and \nCynthia Salter\u0014",

Though\u0014\n                      his condition has stabilized and he maintains \nthe strength to do\u0014\n                      ministry, Ed's health could begin deteriorating \nagain at any time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Leadership editors Marshall Shelley, Eric Reed, \nand Drew Zahn\u0014\n                      traveled to Grand Rapids to probe the prayer \nlife of a man and a\u0014\n                      church walking through the valley of the shadow \nof death.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What happens to your prayer life when you're \ndiagnosed with\u0014\n                      a terminal disease?\u0014\n                      When the doctors said they were 99 percent sure \nI had ALS, I began\u0014\n                      realizing I might have only a couple of months \nto a couple of years\u0014\n                      left, and most of that time would likely be \nmiserable as I watch my\u0014\n                      body slowly quit on me. My natural assumption \nwas that this\u0014\n                      suffering would lift my prayer life to levels \nit had never known before. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The truth was, I didn't feel like praying. I \ndidn't feel like talking to\u0014\n                      God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Near Bethany in Israel, I once visited a place \ncalled Lazarus's tomb,\u0014\n                      where you can walk down a winding stone \nstaircase into a cave at\u0014\n                      the bottom that leads to a deep, dark, \nfirst-century tomb. You can\u0014\n                      crawl in and find yourself confined in that \nnarrow, dark space.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When the doctor said, \"You will lose your \nability to walk, to sit up, to\u0014\n                      swallow, to breathe, and all we can do is help \nyou manage the pain,\"\u0014\n                      I went through several months where I felt like \nI was in Lazarus's\u0014\n                      tombcold, dark, trapped.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      You'd think my first instinct would be to pray \nfor healing. I couldn't\u0014\n                      even bring myself to ask. I prayed for wisdom, \nbecause of all the\u0014\n                      medical options. But I didn't pray for healing \nfor a long time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Were you angry?\u0014\n                      No, I was never angry. There was a woman in our \nchurch who lost\u0014\n                      two husbands while she was still young. She had \nlittle children. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the funeral for her second husband, she got \nup and said, \"I have\u0014\n                      chosen not to ask why. I don't want to waste \nwhat limited energy I\u0014\n                      have on a question for which I don't think I'll \nget an answer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After I was diagnosed, I told her how much her \nwords meant to me.\u0014\n                      So from day one I chose not to ask, Why, God? \nbecause I feared\u0014\n                      that had the potential of causing anger. So, \nno, I've never been angry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How did you crawl out of Lazarus's tomb?\u0014\n                      That's a journey that really began before I was \ndiagnosed. Three\u0014\n                      summers ago I had a friend who challenged me to \nthink of the\u0014\n                      journey of faith not as a Christian life, but \nas a Christian walk. David\u0014\n                      argued that we can \"live\" passively, but \nchoosing to \"walk\" a journey\u0014\n                      is a deliberate decision made moment by moment. \nHe was so\u0014\n                      convinced that we needed to understand this \nthat he proposed we go\u0014\n                      on a pilgrimage, a walking tour all over \nIsrael. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Amazing things happened to us there. We walked \nup to the Mount of\u0014\n                      Beatitudes one day. We had no food. And when we \ngot to the church\u0014\n                      at the top, it was closed for a couple hours. \nWhat were we going to\u0014\n                      do?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We spotted an Arab man selling things to \ntourists from a little stand\u0014\n                      in the shade. We asked him if we could sit for \na while.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He said, \"What are you doing? You walked here? \nFrom where?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He was so stunned that we were walking the dry, \nancient paths, that\u0014\n                      he took his own sandwich, broke it to share \nwith us, and even\u0014\n                      squeezed some fresh orange juice. He fed us \nfrom his own meal, for\u0014\n                      free.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      David and I shared his shade and read the \nSermon on the Mount.\u0014\n                      When we got to Jesus' teaching the people to \npray, \"Give us this day\u0014\n                      our daily bread,\" we began to cry. For the \nfirst time in our lives,\u0014\n                      someone had given us our daily bread when we \nhad no ability to get\u0014\n                      it on our own.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I learned many things on that trip that I \nneeded later when I was\u0014\n                      diagnosed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      God was preparing you spiritually for the trial \nyou're facing\u0014\n                      now?\u0014\n                      I think so, yes. While we were there, David got \nvery sick and was\u0014\n                      hospitalized. He ended up needing heart \nsurgery. Our walk across\u0014\n                      Israel came to a screeching halt. I went there \nto grow spiritually, and\u0014\n                      I was stuck doing hospital visitation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One evening in Jerusalem, waiting for David to \nrecover, I was reading\u0014\n                      through the Psalms, and I got to Psalm \n48:12-14: \"Consider the\u0014\n                      walls of Jerusalem. Walk around them. Count the \nfortresses. See\u0014\n                      what God has done. This God is our God. He will \nbe our guide even\u0014\n                      to the very end.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So I read, \"Walk around the walls,\" and I was \nthirty feet from that\u0014\n                      very wall. I sat there wondering, Do I go walk \naround the walls? Is\u0014\n                      this the message? I couldn't shake the thought.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The next morning I got up to walk the walls and \nI kept repeating, This\u0014\n                      God is our God, he will be our guide to the \nvery end. About halfway\u0014\n                      around the wall something came over me. Now, \nI'm IrishI'm\u0014\n                      practical, rationalbut for an hour and a half \nI was caught up in\u0014\n                      something bigger than myself. My feet were \nbarely touching the\u0014\n                      ground.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I was diagnosed, those prayers, \"This God \nis our God, he will\u0014\n                      be our guide to the very end,\" came back to me. \nThey were the\u0014\n                      comfort that allowed to me to trust him again.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So \"considering the walls\" became a key element \nof your\u0014\n                      prayer life.\u0014\n                      That time in Israel opened up a whole new \nappreciation of prayer\u0014\n                      from outside my usual box of understanding. For \ninstance, I came\u0014\n                      back with a great appreciation for how the \nJewish rabbis pray. We\u0014\n                      ask God to bless the food; Jews think that's \nridiculous. \"God sent\u0014\n                      the rain, the sunshine, the nutrients. What do \nyou mean, bless the\u0014\n                      food? It's already blessed! You bless God for \ngiving the food.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I discovered in Judaism they have a blessing \nfor everything. When\u0014\n                      they go to the bathroom, they bless God for \ntheir colon. We would\u0014\n                      consider that earthy and mundane. But I learned \nthere's a world of\u0014\n                      thankfulness that we rarely explore.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There's also that gratefulness in the \nAfrican-American community,\u0014\n                      where I've heard prayers like, \"Thank you, \nLord, for waking me up\u0014\n                      this morning.\" I never used to thank God for \nthat. After getting\u0014\n                      ALSI do now.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The major change in my prayer life is that most \nof my prayers now\u0014\n                      are prayers of gratitude as opposed to a long \nlist of requests. I'm just\u0014\n                      happy to be alive. I'm happy that you came here \ntoday. I'm happy to\u0014\n                      be able to do everything I'm able to do. I feel \nlike Lou Gehrig in his\u0014\n                      final speech, \"I'm the luckiest man on Earth.\" \nExcept I'm not lucky,\u0014\n                      I'm blessed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How has the prospect of death affected you \nspiritually?\u0014\n                      Dying has forced me to wrestle with confession. \nWhen I was\u0014\n                      diagnosed I thought, If I'm going to die, I \nwant to die with a clear\u0014\n                      conscience and whole relationships. I knew \nthere were people I had\u0014\n                      offended, people I needed to ask for \nforgiveness. So I made a list and\u0014\n                      began calling. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I called Jerry Falwell, Bob Jones, and many \nothers and said, \"I want\u0014\n                      to ask your forgiveness for anything I've said \nor done that has hurt\u0014\n                      you.\" It was freeing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then I got a call myself from Jim Dobson. He \ncalled to tell me he and\u0014\n                      Shirley had been praying for me. \"I believe God \nhealed me when I\u0014\n                      had a stroke,\" he said, \"and we're praying that \nGod will heal you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I cried as I realized his call was \nprovidential, and I asked him for his\u0014\n                      forgiveness. And then he said, \"I've said \nthings I know were hurtful to\u0014\n                      you, too, and I want you to forgive me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now that I face death I understand why Jim is \nso passionate, even\u0014\n                      inflexible over certain issues. It's because \nhe's faced death too.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Has your ministry been affected?\u0014\n                      Many in the church claim my preaching has \nchanged, but I suspect\u0014\n                      it may be their listening that's changed. We're \nlearning a greater\u0014\n                      sensitivity to broken people because I'm \nbroken. They know I may\u0014\n                      not preach many more times. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I'm probably a little bolder now, too. I've set \nmy heart on finishing with\u0014\n                      grace and dignity and integrity; so I don't \ncare what people think any\u0014\n                      more. We're not a hand-raising kind of church, \nbut once in a while I\u0014\n                      lift my hands to worship. I know that \naggravates some people. So I\u0014\n                      told the congregation, \"Look, I know some of \nyou are a little\u0014\n                      concerned about me raising my hands. But I'm \ndying, so I really\u0014\n                      don't care.\" They laughed with me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How has Calvary Church responded?\u0014\n                      It has been overwhelming. I get hundreds of \ncards and notes. People\u0014\n                      pray for me at every meal. I'm especially \ntouched when kids tell me\u0014\n                      they pray God will heal me. I have a strong \nsense this has brought\u0014\n                      the church to its knees in prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What is the church learning in prayer?\u0014\n                      We've been riveted to learning dependence on \nGod. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In most cases, we can pray, God, guide the \nsurgeon, use the\u0014\n                      chemotherapy, direct the radiation. With ALS \nyou can't pray for any\u0014\n                      of that because there's nothing the doctors can \ndo. And there's\u0014\n                      nothing we can do. We have to depend solely on \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But this season is only one step on the walk of \nfaith that the whole\u0014\n                      church has been on for years. God used the \nwilderness of Israel to\u0014\n                      shape my life's walk for this, and God used a \nwilderness experience\u0014\n                      to prepare Calvary as well.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I first came to Calvary, like many \nchurches, there was a\u0014\n                      disparity between what we believed about prayer \nand what we\u0014\n                      actually practiced. On a personal level, one of \nmy weaknesses has\u0014\n                      always been a dependence on my own abilities \nrather than on God.\u0014\n                      Our church was largely the same way.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We had the ability, like most large churches, \nto create endless\u0014\n                      programs for recruiting endless people to get \ninvolved in. At one point\u0014\n                      I felt like we were going a hundred miles an \nhour, in every direction,\u0014\n                      without paying attention to God like we should. \nWe professed\u0014\n                      dependence on God, but we were running on our \nown fuel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I decided Calvary needed to remove the \ndistraction and busyness to\u0014\n                      seek God. We agreed to take a one-year \ntime-out. We shut down all\u0014\n                      our programs and activities except Sunday \nmorning and evening\u0014\n                      church. For one year we devoted ourselves to \nnothing but personal\u0014\n                      Bible reading, prayer, and personal evangelism. \nDuring that year we\u0014\n                      talked about prayer, taught about prayer, \ncreated opportunities for\u0014\n                      prayer. We tried to get away from the mindset \nthat prayer is just\u0014\n                      another program. We tried to integrate it into \nour lives and into our\u0014\n                      decision making.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Canceling your big community holiday programs \nwas gutsy.\u0014\n                      We even heard about it at our office.\u0014\n                      There was criticism from people involved in the \nChristmas musical,\u0014\n                      the Easter program, the children's programs, \nand the Sunday\u0014\n                      afternoon committees. But enough was enough. \nWith all our\u0014\n                      programs we weren't leaving room for God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Leaving room for God?\u0014\n                      Yes. Long before I came, the church had an \ninterim pastor, an older\u0014\n                      man in his seventies. The board went to a \ncountry club one night for\u0014\n                      a strategic planning meeting. They brought in a \nconsultant to help\u0014\n                      them set long-range goals and plan a move to a \nbeautiful new facility.\u0014\n                      Throughout the meeting, the interim pastor sat \nthere quietly,\u0014\n                      patiently, listening. He never said a word. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the end of the meeting they asked the pastor \nif he would say a\u0014\n                      few words and offer a prayer. He said, \"Yes. I \nhave four words I'd like\u0014\n                      to say. Leave room for God. \"Then he prayed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The leadership of the church has never \nforgotten those words. After\u0014\n                      all the strategy and planning, they ended up \nthrowing all the plans\u0014\n                      away. With those four words he brought the \nchurch back from\u0014\n                      self-reliance to seeking God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After our church's year-long tour of prayer, we \nsaw a return to that\u0014\n                      pastor's wise words. Our board meetings, for \nexample, used to begin\u0014\n                      with prayer, but the whole time we'd be \nthinking, Hurry up and get\u0014\n                      this prayer over with. We've got a lot of \nbusiness to do. Now we\u0014\n                      spend extended time in prayer. Praying for \ndirection doesn't get in\u0014\n                      the way of the church leader's business because \npraying for direction\u0014\n                      is the church leader's business.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How does that affect the decisions the church \nmakes?\u0014\n                      The process of growing in prayer has profoundly \naffected how we\u0014\n                      plan for the future. Our board is made up of \nmostly lawyers, doctors,\u0014\n                      CEO'stheir mindset is very business oriented. \nBut that's not the\u0014\n                      way the church operates. We don't have any \none-, two-, or ten-year\u0014\n                      plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That leaves a lot of room. Is it too flexible?\u0014\n                      Not at all. A couple of years ago we decided we \nwere going to build a\u0014\n                      youth center and add on to our auditoriuma \n$4.5 million project.\u0014\n                      The facility committee had the plans drawn. The \nfinance committee\u0014\n                      had worked out all the details. The board had \npresented the plan to\u0014\n                      the congregation. But we decided to wait one \nmore month before\u0014\n                      proceeding just to pray and make sure we had \npeace with it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the next meeting, the entire board agreed \nthere was something\u0014\n                      wrong. We didn't sense God leading us to \ncontinue. And so, in spite\u0014\n                      of the fact that we had presented it to the \ncongregation, spent money\u0014\n                      on the plans, set up committees, and had \neverything printed, we\u0014\n                      decided unanimously not to proceed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I announced the next Sunday that we \nweren't going to do it,\u0014\n                      many in the congregation came up and said, \"I \nwas willing to support\u0014\n                      the board's decision to build, but truthfully, \nI wasn't real settled that\u0014\n                      we should do this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We still haven't built that building. In fact, \nwe made the commitment\u0014\n                      that we weren't going to. Last year we gave 39 \npercent of our total\u0014\n                      income away to missions and community projects, \nand we felt\u0014\n                      building would greatly inhibit our ability to \ngive resources away.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Leaving room for God released a greater freedom \nto respond to the\u0014\n                      Spirit of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      You're the leader of a congregation. Do you \nfind you have to\u0014\n                      think about and plan for their future?\u0014\n                      No. Leave room for God. Of course, part of me \nthinks I really ought to\u0014\n                      begin looking for someone who can begin taking \nresponsibilities and\u0014\n                      who may one day pastor this church. Another \npart of me realizes\u0014\n                      that God dropped me in here even though I never \nintended to come.\u0014\n                      He's got someone else who doesn't intend to be \nhere either that he'll\u0014\n                      bring at the right time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many of the things we do as a church we didn't \nset out to do. The\u0014\n                      social work we do, and the Mars Hill \ncongregation we helped start,\u0014\n                      these just happened as we followed the Lord and \nhis opening of\u0014\n                      certain doors.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If you're not worried about the church, what \nfears do you\u0014\n                      wrestle with?\u0014\n                      I don't worry about being dead because I know \nwhere I'm going. But I\u0014\n                      do worry about dying itself. Will I choke to \ndeath? When I can't\u0014\n                      breathe, will I panic in that moment? The \nprocess of dying is\u0014\n                      fearsome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I pray about that fear and repeat Scriptures \nI've memorized: God has\u0014\n                      said, \"I will never leave you. I will never \nforsake you.\" The Lord is my\u0014\n                      helper, I will not be afraid.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For a while after I was diagnosed, every \nconversation with my wife,\u0014\n                      no matter what subject we started on, always \ngot back to my\u0014\n                      disease. You're tempted to spend so much time \nworrying over the\u0014\n                      future, obsessing about your disease and your \ndeath. My wife prays\u0014\n                      that God will help me to spend my last days \nliving, rather than dying.\u0014\n                      I pray the same for others.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When I visit a terminally ill patient now, it's \nnot a thirty-minute\u0014\n                      visitation, but a two-hour soul-to-soul. While \nthe sick and hurting\u0014\n                      may have appreciated what I said before, and \nwhat I said was true,\u0014\n                      now they know it's coming from a person who is \nfacing what they're\u0014\n                      facing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's going on inside of you when you're \npraying for\u0014\n                      someone else's healing, and yet you yearn for \nthat healing\u0014\n                      yourself?\u0014\n                      When you're terminally ill, you're never \njealous if somebody else gets\u0014\n                      healed because you don't wish what you have on \nanybody. I've\u0014\n                      learned that from a network of friends who have \nALS. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I visit with a man here in town who can move \nnothing but one\u0014\n                      eyebrow and one eye. He's on a ventilator, has \na feeding tube, and\u0014\n                      communicates through a computer. He keeps \nsaying, \"I hope you\u0014\n                      don't have ALS. I'll be thrilled if the doctors \nare mistaken.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So if somebody else gets healed and not me, I'm \njust happy for\u0014\n                      them, genuinely happy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Do you pray for healing now?\u0014\n                      Yes, but not every day. I no more want to \nobsess about healing than\u0014\n                      about dying. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have muscle atrophy and nerve damage in my \nright hand and arm,\u0014\n                      and I have twitches all over my body. There's a \nremote possibility\u0014\n                      that the disease could remain localized in that \narm, in which case it\u0014\n                      wouldn't kill me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So I have three prayers for healinga \nsmall-faith version, a\u0014\n                      medium-faith one, and a big-faith prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When my faith is small I pray, Lord, I'll give \nup my right hand, just let\u0014\n                      the disease stop there. If I'm a little \nstronger in my faith, I'll pray,\u0014\n                      Lord, stop it right where it is, no worse than \nit is today. If I'm feeling\u0014\n                      particularly bold I pray, Maybe you could heal \nme, Lord. Maybe you\u0014\n                      could reverse this disease.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One night I asked my friend, the former pastor \nof First Assembly, to\u0014\n                      come over and anoint me with oil. He talked to \nme about people he\u0014\n                      has anointed who got healed and people he \nanointed who didn't.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He said to me, \"You need to get lost in the \nwonder of God. If you'll\u0014\n                      get lost in that wonder, who knows what he'll \ndo for you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I understood him to mean that if I get lost in \nthe love of God, the\u0014\n                      faithfulness of God, the power of Godif I can \nfocus not on healing,\u0014\n                      but on the Healerthen watch out. That \nperspective really changes\u0014\n                      how I pray.\u0014",

    "words": "from a Harrier pilot, USMC. His view...... \u0014\n\u0014\nDear Americans, \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I opened my e-mail this morning I had about twenty forwards of \nthe\u0014\narticle written by Gordon Sinclair, the Canadian who so eloquently\u0014\npraised the United States. What most of you do not realize is that \nthis\u0014\ncommentary was written many years ago. Those of us in the Military\u0014\nService have known about it for a long time. Now, Americans are \nflooding\u0014\nthe net with it as if it were new. It is not. When it was written most\u0014\nAmericans didn't read it, because most Americans did not care. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tragedy that befell all of us on September 11th shocked America.\u0014\nAmerica no longer feels safe. Many of you have said, \"The government\u0014\nshould have known! 30 Billion Dollars is spent on intelligence! What\u0014\nabout the Military!?\" Just a reminder America, you voted our \ngovernment\u0014\ninto office. For years you allowed some dishonest politicians and\u0014\ntwisted television media personalities to shape your ideas about the\u0014\ndefense of our nation. Why? Because most Americans were too lazy to \nlook\u0014\nbeyond the three minute sound-bites on the evening news. Here's a news\u0014\nflash not being broadcast much, \"On September 11th, America had the \nexact\u0014\nlevel of protection, both militarily and intelligence, that it was\u0014\nwilling to pay for\". \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly yesterday the Congress and the Senate approved 40 BILLION \ndollars as\u0014\na \"Down Payment\" to fight this War. A short time ago, our politicians\u0014\nsaid a 100 Million dollar increase for the Navy budget was \nsubstantial.\u0014\nIn that same bill they ordered the Navy to conduct an 85 Million \nDollar\u0014\nStudy on...guess what America!? Missiles Defense?! No. Desperately \nneeded\u0014\nparts for our fighter aircraft? Wrong again. Training for Navy Seals? \nNah\u0014\nuh. They wanted Breast Cancer research. Yes, America, your elected\u0014\nofficials decided that the US Navy needed more mammograms and less\u0014\nmissiles. Was this an under the table sneaky move? No, it was right \nout\u0014\nin the open. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy \nboth\u0014\nopposed it. A New York Senatorial Candidate (Yes, she's the one) was\u0014\nenraged that the Military would be so sexist and irresponsible to the\u0014\nneeds of civilians and wanted the Navy to give the money back\u0014\nimmediately! But the media paid it little mind. So, America paid \nlittle\u0014\nattention. \u0014\n\u0014\nDid any one ever watch CSPAN? Particularly when the Heads of our Armed\u0014\nServices essentially begged OUR representatives to give the Military \nmore\u0014\nmoney to fight terrorism and maintain a strong defense? Did you see \nthe\u0014\ndebates by the Heads of the Intelligence Services that terrorism was \nthe\u0014\nnew threat? They told the committees of Congress that the CIA, the \nFBI,\u0014\nand the Service did not have the money to build the necessary\u0014\nintelligence networks in the areas where terrorists were being \nharbored.\u0014\nThey warned again and again that there was clear and present danger\u0014\nwithin America's borders. America must have been watching one of the\u0014\nother 114 satellite channels. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Military said: \"We need more money to maintain military readiness \nand\u0014\nCombat Training.\" America Answered : \"What the Military needs is\u0014\nSensitivity Training! You're all sexist homophobes! I saw it on 60\u0014\nMinutes!\" The Military said: \"We need money to build ships,  planes, \u0014\ntanks, and  improve our  technology.  America still has credible \nthreats\u0014\nthroughout the world. Terrorism will come to America's doorstep.\" \nAmerica\u0014\nAnswered: \"You're all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. There is \nno\u0014\nmore Soviet Threat! My Senator told me so! He/She says we do not need\u0014\nsuch a big military! You're dinosaurs trying to hold onto the Cold \nWar!\u0014\nWe need Social Programs!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Military said: \"We need to recruit more Americans into the \nmilitary.\u0014\nWe need to increase our force.\" America Answered: \"You're not taking \nmy\u0014\nkids!   We're going to shut down the ROTC programs at our high schools\u0014\nand universities, because you discriminate against alternative\u0014\nlifestyles! ROTC teaches CHILDREN (under 21) how to shoot guns! You \njust\u0014\nwant another Columbine! Rosie and Oprah say so!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Military said: \"We can't keep interfering in the civil wars of \nsmall\u0014\ninsignificant countries. It wastes our time, expends our resources,\u0014\ndecreases training, and demoralizes our troops. The men and women of \nthe\u0014\nUnited States are Warriors trying to defend OUR nation, we are not the\u0014\nthird world's police force.\" America Answered: \"You heartless \nbastards!\u0014\nCan't you see the tear in the eye of that starving child!! There are\u0014\nflies on her face for Christ's Sake!? Get Moving! Jesse Jackson on CNN\u0014\nsaid that is what we pay you for!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Military Asked: \"Why isn't America enraged over the terror ist \nattack\u0014\non the USS COLE that killed seventeen AMERICAN Sailors? How about the \nAir\u0014\nForce barracks bombed in Saudi Arabia? The embassy staffs in Africa? \nThe\u0014\nSoldiers mutilated and dragged through the streets in Somalia?\" \nAmerica\u0014\nAnswered: \"We don't have time right now! We're busy defending Animal\u0014\nRights! Our schools are handing out automatic weapons! The federal\u0014\ngovernment is discriminating against cross-dressing Bolivian\u0014\nhermaphrodites! The police are all members of the Ku Klux Klan! The \nlack\u0014\nof Ozone is ruining my tan! If they cut deeper into Food Stamps those\u0014\npoor women will have to move down to Size 18/20 Channel dresses! AND \nTHE\u0014\nWORST! Corporations are raising the prices of there products sooo \nhigh I\u0014\nmight not be able to afford the multi-disc DVD Player for my 36'\" \ndigital\u0014\nready TV! Besides, YOU GUYS ARE PAID TO DIE! \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, America, while you sit on your couch or around your office coffee\u0014\npots and ask, \"Why did those terrorists kill innocent civilians?

    "words": "Editorial 12/17/01, US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT\u0014\n\u0014\n                      BY MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, a clarity of vision\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How things change! During last year's \npresidential campaign, George W.\u0014\n                      Bush's opponents derided him for his ignorance \nof foreign affairs. Yet it is in\u0014\n                      international affairs where President Bush has \ncome into his own. On the\u0014\n                      dominant issue of the day, global terrorism, \nthe president is showing vision,\u0014\n                      courage, boldness, and wisdom. He recognizes \nthe moral incoherence of\u0014\n                      fighting terror with one hand and appeasing it \nwith the other. This is the\u0014\n                      clearheaded principle of his response to the \nmurderous crisis in the Middle\u0014\n                      East. It is of great importance that Bush has \nabandoned the traditional\u0014\n                      \"evenhandedness\" of the State Department and \nthe Clinton administration,\u0014\n                      the blurring of the distinction between the \narsonist and the firefighter,\u0014\n                      between aggression and self-defense. That \npolicy of well-meaning\u0014\n                      equivocation failed in the Middle East because \nit presumed on the good faith\u0014\n                      of a terrorist, Yasser Arafat, a man who has \nbeen even more of a disruptive\u0014\n                      force than Osama bin Laden. Arafat is guilty of \nnot one but three betrayals:\u0014\n                      betrayal of his promises at Oslo, betrayal of \nhis duty to make a just peace for\u0014\n                      the sake of the Palestinians, betrayal of the \nworld's best hopes for the Middle\u0014\n                      East. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Terrorism has\u0014\n                      now struck\u0014\n                      throughout Israel.\u0014\n                      Bombs are\u0014\n                      exploded in the\u0014\n                      sure knowledge\u0014\n                      that the dead and\u0014\n                      wounded will be\u0014\n                      innocent women\u0014\n                      and children. In\u0014\n                      the past two\u0014\n                      weeks, dozens of\u0014\n                      Israelis have\u0014\n                      suffered death or\u0014\n                      maiming in\u0014\n                      numbers that in\u0014\n                      America would\u0014\n                      represent over\u0014\n                      2,000 dead and\u0014\n                      5,000 wounded. And the toll would have been \nmuch higher if Israel had not\u0014\n                      been able to foil an additional 16 suicide \nattacks in the same period. Israelis\u0014\n                      live with terror every day in a way that we in \nAmerica have only just glimpsed.\u0014\n                      The Israeli citizen knows that at any moment on \nany given day a hate-filled\u0014\n                      bomber may try to take innocent civilians with \nhim across the border\u0014\n                      between life and death. Every day, the \nmutilated bodies are likely to be\u0014\n                      followed by a mutilation of truthfrom Arafat. \nHow can Israelis live a normal\u0014\n                      life? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Skewed moral relativism. There have been \nendless attempts to legitimize\u0014\n                      the terrorism. The woolly minded and the malign \naffect not to see the\u0014\n                      difference between the indiscriminate murder of \nIsraelis and Israel's policy\u0014\n                      of selective retaliation against the killers. \nPresident Bush knows better. In the\u0014\n                      United Nations, he rejected the idea that any \n\"imagined wrong\" justifies\u0014\n                      terrorism. He understands instinctively that \nterrorism and the reaction to\u0014\n                      terrorism should not be paired in the morally \ncontradicting clich of a \"cycle\u0014\n                      of violence.\" His perception informs his \npragmatism. The president\u0014\n                      understands that the only thing that might \nprovoke Arafat to move against\u0014\n                      terrorism is the prospect of being identified \nas a terrorist, and of Israel's\u0014\n                      receiving the support due a democracy besieged \nby terror. He also sees that\u0014\n                      the Palestinians can reclaim the bargain struck \nat Oslosecurity for Israel in\u0014\n                      return for an end of Israeli control over \nPalestiniansonly if the Palestinian\u0014\n                      Authority wages war on its own terrorists. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The moral clarity of the president has now \nprovided diplomatic clarity. That's\u0014\n                      why Washington demands that Arafat apprehends \nthe\u0014\n                      terroristsimmediately. That same logic \nexplains why the Bush\u0014\n                      administration refuses to criticize Israel for \ndefending itself. And that's why\u0014\n                      administration aides imply that a recalcitrant \nArafat could well end up on the\u0014\n                      presidential list as a host of terror. That \nwould mean suspending relations\u0014\n                      with Arafat and the PA. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is not the first \"moment of truth\" for \nArafat. The truth has long been clear.\u0014\n                      It is that Arafat has always been on the side \nof terror. To date, waiting for\u0014\n                      Arafat to make peace has been a fool's game. \nTragically, the game has now\u0014\n                      exploded precisely at the moment Israeli Prime \nMinister Ariel Sharon was\u0014\n                      prepared to unveil proposals that would have \ndemonstrated flexibility,\u0014\n                      pragmatism, and a strong desire to advance the \npeace process. All this is\u0014\n                      wiped out now. There should be no talks with \nArafat until he has decisively\u0014\n                      dealt with his terrorists. The precedent is \nthere. In 1990, the first President\u0014\n                      Bush responded to Palestine Liberation \nOrganization terror by severing ties\u0014\n                      to Arafat; months later, the reward was a \ngroundbreaking dialogue in Madrid.\u0014\n                      Now the second Bush administration is forcing \nArafat to choose again:\u0014\n                      Support the war against global terror or \nsupport Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the\u0014\n                      head of Hamas, and face the consequences. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What has occurred in Israel is clearly not \nspontaneous, individual terrorism.\u0014\n                      It is organized, round-the-clock terrorism. It \nis not just Islamic Jihad or\u0014\n                      Hamas, or the Tanzim, or Force 17, or any of \nthose groups. It is all of them,\u0014\n                      united in a single, formal committee, with a \ncommon purpose: to kill as\u0014\n                      many Israelis as possible, to sow as much \nterrorism as possible, and to\u0014\n                      pressure Israel to agree to conditions dictated \nby the Palestinians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And who is coordinating, commissioning, and \nfunding these attacks?\u0014\n                      Yasser Arafat, the same old Arafat. This is the \nman who was the first to\u0014\n                      hijack planes, the first to put bombs on \nplanes, the first to kill schoolchildren,\u0014\n                      the first to kill athletes in the Olympics, the \nman who invented terrorism\u0014\n                      against innocent civilians to put pressure on \ngovernment. This is the man\u0014\n                      who calls suicide bombers martyrs. Arafat made \nthe strategic decision to\u0014\n                      engage in terror. He poses as a victim, blaming \nthe terror attacks on\u0014\n                      otherseven on Israelis. He suggests that the \nIsraelis committed some of\u0014\n                      the attacks to secure worldwide sympathy for \nIsrael. This is of the same\u0014\n                      order of malevolence as the absurdity being \npropagated by some in the\u0014\n                      Muslim world who say no Jews died September 11, \nbecause Jews planned\u0014\n                      the bombing. The idea that Arafat wants to rein \nin Hamas and Islamic Jihad\u0014\n                      and the Tanzim is just as preposterous. It is \nthis misperception of Arafat as a\u0014\n                      man who might moderate terror that causes some \nworld leaders to murmur,\u0014\n                      Ah, the future of the Middle East is in your \nhands. It is the terror also that gets\u0014\n                      Arafat the money from abroad, a good deal of \nwhich goes into his personal\u0014\n                      bank account in Paris, where his family lives. \nIt is terror that provides the\u0014\n                      rationale for the continued existence of a \ncorrupt, antidemocratic, and\u0014\n                      authoritative regime in the West Bank and Gaza, \na regime that has brought\u0014\n                      nothing but misery to his people and death and \ninjury to the young. As Golda\u0014\n                      Meir once said, \"We will have peace with the \nArabs when they love their\u0014\n                      children more than they hate us.\" That moment \nhas not yet come. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Arafat, ejected from Jordan and Lebanon, \nfinally left his stopping place\u0014\n                      in Tunis to come to Gaza, he was essentially \ngiven a choice: either a state or\u0014\n                      terrorism. Perversely, Arafat said yes to \nterrorism and no to a state. We saw it\u0014\n                      again last year at Camp David. Arafat would not \naccept the huge\u0014\n                      concessions offered by then Prime Minister Ehud \nBarak and endorsed by\u0014\n                      President Clinton. If he had, a Palestinian \nflag would be flying today over a\u0014\n                      sovereign, independent, internationally \nrecognized Palestinian state, and\u0014\n                      there would be no Israeli occupation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      No wonder not a single intelligence official \nbelieves Arafat intends to\u0014\n                      abandon terrorism, or that he will ever carry \nout the cease-fires, except for a\u0014\n                      brief tactical period. The Palestinian, \npan-Arabic, and Islamic rhetoricpaired\u0014\n                      with antisemitic, anti-Zionist, anti-Israel \nvitriol that the PA has\u0014\n                      disseminatedmakes it impossible for him to \nabandon terror. It makes\u0014\n                      impossible an agreement with the Israelis, or \neven a cease-fire accord, for\u0014\n                      that would leave Arafat open to the charge of \ntreachery from the people he\u0014\n                      has so grossly misled. Arafat knows this, so \nhis response to pressure is to\u0014\n                      draw on his repertoire of fakery. He says he \nhas arrested more than 180\u0014\n                      people in the past week. Alas, almost all are \npeople on the payroll of the PA.\u0014\n                      Very few, if any, of these \"arrests\" were of \nthe 108 terrorist leaders the\u0014\n                      Israelis have identified. But haven't Hamas and \nIslamic Jihad and Tanzim\u0014\n                      been pressed by Arafat to lay down their arms? \nNo, it is more smoke and\u0014\n                      mirrors. No such order was issued by Arafat, or \nby anyone else in the PA. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In effect, Arafat is ignoring the U.S. \nadmonition to make a 100 percent drive\u0014\n                      on terror. He must still think that the old \nClinton policy prevailsthat the\u0014\n                      United States would not respond with punishment \nif we were humiliated by\u0014\n                      the Palestinians' breaches of U.S.-brokered \ncease-fire accords signed by\u0014\n                      Arafat. Not so anymore. Not with the Bush \nadministration. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Clinton administration tolerated the \nPalestinians' use of the land they\u0014\n                      acquired under Oslo not to make peace but to \nestablish a territorial base\u0014\n                      from which to fight Israel. The Clinton \nadministration urged Israel to take\u0014\n                      risks for peace. But when Israel took those \nrisks and terrorism broke out\u0014\n                      within pre-1967 Israeli bordersin Tel Aviv, \nHaifa, and Jerusalemeven the\u0014\n                      restrained Israeli responses were criticized as \nexcessive. No wonder Arafat\u0014\n                      believed he could let the terrorists loose \nagain without penalty. He could\u0014\n                      safely condemn terror in English because the \nterrorists know the real\u0014\n                      message is the one he gives in Arabic. In fact, \nArafat has not held a single\u0014\n                      terrorist under arrest for any lengthy period \nof time in the eight years since\u0014\n                      Oslo. Thus the Bush administration's warning \nthat PA prisons must not only\u0014\n                      have bars on the front doors but locks on the \nback. The administration is\u0014\n                      also wise in its refusal to restrain Israel \nnow. To do otherwiseto restrain\u0014\n                      only Israelwould legitimize the terror \norganized by Arafat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Trojan horse.\" The sad fact is that the West \nBank has become exactly what\u0014\n                      the supporters of the Oslo accords said it \nwould not be: an irredentist state,\u0014\n                      with heavily armed police, joined with heavily \narmed Islamic units to attack\u0014\n                      Israelis. Oslo gave Arafat political power, \nlegitimacy, and money. Eight years\u0014\n                      later, we see clearly that Arafat is not the \npeace partner he represented\u0014\n                      himself to be and that when he speaks of a just \nand lasting peace, he\u0014\n                      doesn't mean a peace with the Jewish state but \nwithout it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This has long been Arafat's missiona mission \nthat he has stated publicly\u0014\n                      and repeatedly. And it has been confirmed by \nmany other Palestinian\u0014\n                      leaders. Faisal Husseini, long considered one \nof the most moderate\u0014\n                      Palestinian leaders, described the Oslo \nagreement, before his death, as a\u0014\n                      \"Trojan horse\" whose real goal was the \nliberation of Palestine from the river\u0014\n                      to the sea. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Remove the pacific mask Arafat wears when it \nsuits the needs of the hour,\u0014\n                      and the face of terror and hypocrisy is \nglaringly clear. Arafat took the area of\u0014\n                      the West Bank with a promised down payment on \npeace and never honored\u0014\n                      it. Instead, he used his embryonic state as the \nbasis for terrorism. He has\u0014\n                      seen it not as a training ground for statehood \nbut as a base where terrorists\u0014\n                      can be trained and concealed, and a controlled \nmedia used not for\u0014\n                      education and understanding but to incite \nhatred against their neighbors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Israelis learned a long time ago what \nAmerica has just learned so\u0014\n                      painfully. It is no use threatening terrorists. \nThey must be defeated.\u0014",

Shoot it with a submachine gun? It survives.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But run it over with a sport utility vehicle or kick it \nlike a football and it crumbles, according to a just\u0014\npublished investigation into that evergreen Christmas question: How \ncan you get rid of the fruitcake?\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Reno Gazette-Journal, in an effort to rid its readers' \nhomes of the unloved seasonal treat, mounted a series of experiments \nto determine the best way to destroy a gift \"nearly everyone receives \nand few actually  want.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"The SUV was what did them in most definitively,\" Camille \nHayes, the Gazette-Journal reporter who organized the fruitcake \nsurvival test, said on Thursday.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Hayes marshaled several aides and, using store-bought \nfruitcakes, organized the punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The first test involved dropping fruitcakes from the roof \nof a two-story house onto a concrete basketball court.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"In the moments before it was let fly, our team wondered if \nthe fruitcake would shatter, bounce or remain\u0014\n          intact. The answer was none of the above,\" Hayes recounted.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Instead, the cake survived the drop relatively unscathed, \nexhibiting only a few \"fissures\" in its dense body.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The second test involved running over a fruitcake with a \n3,000-pound sport utility vehicle. This proved to be\u0014\n          more effective, leaving a \"tire-marked, raisin-flecked \nsmear on the asphalt,\" Hayes wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n          A third test, submitting the fruitcake to the power of a \nfootball place kicker, was also gratifying, resulting in\u0014\n          an explosion of candied fruit as the fruitcake \ndisintegrated.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Strangely, a uniquely Nevada-style solution to the \nfruitcake problem -- shooting them with submachine\u0014\n          guns -- proved disappointing, Hayes said. \"Nevada is a \nstate in which machine guns are legal to own and\u0014\n          operate, so I thought it would be a treat to see what one \ndid,\" Hayes said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Not much, as it turned out. Pummeling a pair of target \nfruitcakes with two M-11 fully automatic submachine\u0014\n          guns resulted in only minor damage, Hayes reported.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"The larger cake proved especially resilient. Rather than \nshattering it into the smithereens we had\u0014\n          expected, the volley of bullets merely nibbled at its \nedges. And as for the dark center of the beast, it proved\u0014\n          too dense to lose its shape.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          Hayes said her fruitcake demolition campaign had garnered \nlargely favorable reviews from the readers of\u0014\n          the Reno Gazette, and that she might try again next year \nwith some more ambitious strategies -- like\u0014\n          dropping fruitcakes from a helicopter.\u0014",

Eventually they will meet a \nguide who will escort them for\u0014\n                         the remainder of the trip.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Most escapees had to cross the Ohio River \nwhich is too wide and too swift\u0014\n                         to swim. The Railroad struggled with the \nproblem of how to get escapees\u0014\n                         across, and with experience, came to believe \nthe best crossing time was\u0014\n                         winter. Then the river was frozen, and \nescapees could walk across on the\u0014\n                         ice. Since it took most escapees a year to \ntravel from the South to the\u0014\n                         Ohio, the Railroad urged slaves to start \ntheir trip in winter in order to be at\u0014\n                         the Ohio the next winter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      The river bank makes a very \ngood road,\u0014\n                                         The dead trees show you the \nway,\u0014\n                                          Left foot, peg foot, \ntraveling on\u0014\n                                            Follow the Drinking Gourd.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                         This verse taught slaves to follow the bank \nof the Tombighee River north\u0014\n                         looking for dead trees that were marked with \ndrawings of a left foot and a\u0014\n                         peg foot.

    "words": "Forgiveness in Action \u0014\n\u0014\n  The world is witnessing astonishing acts of forgiveness and of\u0014\n  seeking forgiveness. Pope John Paul II made a comprehensive\u0014\n  apology for the sins committed by the Roman Catholic Church\u0014\n  and its members against groups of people throughout its history.\u0014\n  In South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u0014\n  submitted its Final Report to President Nelson Mandela. Prime\u0014\n  Minister Tony Blair, of the United Kingdom, sought forgiveness\u0014\n  for England's role in the Irish Potato Famine. Leaders of\u0014\n  Cambodia's Khmer Rouge have come forward in search of\u0014\n  amnesty. Following September 11, 2001, Palestinian and Israeli\u0014\n  officials issued orders to pull back from aggression and\u0014\n  violence. \u0014\n\u0014\n  We see its effects in our communities as well: when warring\u0014\n  gangs call for a cease-fire after years of senseless killings;\u0014\n  when a spouse accepts into their home a marriage partner who\u0014\n  has repented from unfaithfulness; when a former addict\u0014\n  becomes sober, makes amends, and is fully restored to family\u0014\n  and community. \u0014\n\u0014\n  Each time we witness an act of forgiveness, we marvel at its\u0014\n  power to heal, to break a seemingly unending cycle of pain.\u0014\n  Forgiveness is something virtually all Americans aspire to -- 94%\u0014\n  surveyed in a nationwide Gallup poll said it was important to\u0014\n  forgive -- but it is not something we frequently offer. (In the same\u0014\n  survey, only 48% said they usually tried to forgive others.)\u0014\n  Perhaps this is because forgiveness is something we don't fully\u0014\n  understand. Perhaps, as Friedrich Nietzsche did, we associate\u0014\n  forgiveness with weakness. Or perhaps we view forgiveness as\u0014\n  an almost saintly quality that imbues only the very special and\u0014\n  most certainly cannot be learned. \u0014\n\u0014\n  In fact, the opposite is true. Those who have studied it can tell\u0014\n  you without qualification that forgiveness is a sign of strength.\u0014\n  Not only is it a very human quality, displays of forgiveness and\u0014\n  reconciliation are common among monkeys, apes and other\u0014\n  primates, and suggest this behavior has been around for over\u0014\n  thirty million years. And research conducted at the University of\u0014\n  Wisconsin in 1997 indicates forgiveness can be taught and with\u0014\n  positive resutlts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n  More:\u0014",

The news from Afghanistan begins to \nblend.\u0014\n\u0014\nI just know a reporter's exploration of education under Islamic \nfundamentalism yielded a clarifying glimpse not only into a Middle \nEastern world suddenly claiming attention, but also into my own.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking at schools for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, she \nfound that they study only the Koran and hatred.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of learning basic intellectual skills, they memorize verses \nof the holy book. Instead of opening eyes to the larger world, they \nsee all reality through the lens of Islam. Instead of learning the \nvalues of civics, they learn slogans about hating America as the \nenemy of Islam. Their future is centered in jihad.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the daily cascade of news from a previously little-known world, no \nsingle insight manages to explain it all. The strands of this complex \nreality -tribal warfare; centuries of invaders; training camps for \njihad throughout the shadow world of the jobless, landless and \nfrustrated; self-loathing among oil-rich playboys; and autocratic \nregimes shifting blame to America defy easy labeling.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one parallel is emerging: \"Fundamentalism versus modernity.\" \nWhether that starts in a gut-Ievel revulsion at the excesses of \nsecular modernity, or in a tri- umphalist theology that demands rule \nby the saved, or in using theology as a cover for less exalted lusts \nlike power and wealth, Islamic fundamentalism holds up a mirror.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the interweaving of three elements --seeing reality through a holy \nbook, a religious fundamentalism that is determined to quash the \n\"infidel,\" and everyday power struggles made into holy \nwarfare--Islamic fundamentalism sounds disturbingly like Christian \nfundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a holy book  is lifted up as the ultimate source of knowledge, \nthe world outside that book becomes distorted, if not invisible. If \nthe book hasn't addressed a subject, that subject is considered \nunimportant. If reality is perplexing, find an answer in the book, \neven if that answer has no other supporting ground. Those who don't \nread the same book, or don't take it as seriously, are deemed \n\"infidel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity's extreme fundamentalists bomb smaller targets--abortion \nclinics, as opposed to office towers--but they build on the same \npillars: a book, a worldview shaped and bounded by that  book, a \ndistrust of reality that doesn't fit within the book, a desire to \nhave the book answer all questions, preferably for all people, and a \nhostile attitude, verging on contempt, for others.\u0014\n\u0014\nHence the inane arguments pitting the Bible against science, as if \nstories told  between 1000 B.C. and 700 B.C. to explain a nation's \nrise and fal1 could define the creation of matter and of life, the \nplanets, black holes, quantum physics, cancer, molecular biology and \ngenetics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis isn't to say that the Bible and Koran don't matter. A faith \ncommunity needs grounding and guidance, and must be drawn outside the \nnarrow concerns that tend to dominate congregational life. But if the \nholy book is taken too far, then it stops drawing the faithful into \nthe world, but draws them deep within fearful confines where \nmodernity is feared, other- ness is feared, knowledge is feared and \ndiversity is feared.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point, it seems to me, the faithful become like those whom \nJesus spoke against, who trusted only in them selves that they were \nrighteous and regarded others with contempt. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe passion of Christian fundamentalists to take control of \ngovernment, to \"cleanse\" American institutions, to restore some \nformer era's simplicity and values and to withdraw tolerance of \ncertain ways of living doesn't sound remarkably differ- ent from the \ndrive of Islamic fundamen- talists to overthrow moderate regimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Taliban's fundamentalism led to the burqa--the total shrouding of \nwomen to make them invisible. Christian fundamentalists don't go so \nfar in their disenfranchising of women and scape- goating of \nhomosexuals, but they show the same instincts: damn the infidel, \nreverse modernity and scour the holy book for justification.\u0014\n\u0014\n-Tom Ehrich is a writer and computer consultant, managing large-scale \ndatabase implementations.

True, \"the Viennese quack,\" as Vladimir Nabokov dubbed him, \nis no longer enshrined in the pantheon of science, but who can deny \nthat Freud has been Very Influential? \u0014\n\u0014\nTo take the measure of that influence, the Library of Congress \nplanned an exhibit, scheduled to open in 1996, called \"Sigmund Freud: \nConflict and Culture.\" Late in 1995, however, after a number of \nscholars signed a petition calling for the proposed exhibit to \n\"adequately reflect the full spectrum of informed opinion about the \nstatus of Freud's contributions,\" the show was postponed. The library \ncited budgetary reasons, but most observers attributed the action to \nthe controversy raised by critics of the advisory board, which was \nheavily stacked with Freud partisans such as biographer and historian \nPeter Gay. \u0014\n\u0014\nPredictably, the New York Times weighed in with the judgment that the \n\"never-ending backlash against Freud confirms the potency of his \ntheories.\" (Heads, I win; tails, you lose.) Peter Gay agreed. \n\"Freud's message is really hard to take,\" he said, implying that the \ncritics needed psychotherapy. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a long delay, the exhibit, curated by Michael Roth, finally \nopened in October 1998. In that same month, Michael Cromartie \ninterviewed scholar Paul Vitz about Freud and his legacy. Vitz is \nprofessor of psychology at New York University. He is the author of \nmore than 100 articles and four books, including Sigmund Freud's \nChristian Unconscious (1988). Vitz and Cromartie spoke via telephone. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the state of the debate concerning Freud today? Why is he \nstill such a controversial figure?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two kinds of controversy. First, there is controversy over \nFreud the man and what kind of person he was. There is a lot of \nevidence that, as he himself said, he was an \"intellectual \nconquistador.\" He was an intellectual ideologue and conqueror. He was \nin no way a scientist. He was not even a fair clinician in the sense \nthat he was always misrepresenting what he had found. He was \nfrequently rather deceptive. And in addition, he seems to have had \nsome unsavory personal characteristics that have lately been made \npublic. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the major critiques of Freud are not personal. They aim at the \nintellectual structure of the system. Freud himself, and many other \nFreudians when these ideas of his were first proposed, claimed that \npsychoanalysis had achieved the status of a science. These proponents \nheld that Freud's themes were an application of the natural \nscientific tradition to the realm of the mind. Those pretensions are \ngone now. Today virtually no one believes that Freud's understanding \nof the mind has had any impact whatsoever on traditional science. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the critics have said that psychoanalysis is really an \n\"interpretive\" science rather than an empirical science.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it is what I would call an applied philosophy of life. In fact, \nthat is what all psychotherapies are. So therefore, psychoanalysis is \nno more an empirical or naturalistic science than Stoicism, if you \nwill. The Oedipus Complex, for example, is as far from being proven \ntoday as it was at the time of Freud. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, even most psychoanalysts have given up trying to claim that \nthey are practicing science. That is a big shift. Nowadays many \nimportant Freudians talk about psychoanalysis as a kind of \nstorytelling, or mutual narrative interaction. They are getting \ndeeply into hermeneutics and narrative theories. Once you understand \npsychoanalysis as the construction of a story about the person's \nlife, then you have a very different understanding of Freud. It can \nbe helpful, but it leaves the issue of whether it is true or not \nsomewhere behind, and it certainly leaves behind the issue of whether \nit is scientific. \u0014\n\u0014\nFreud scholar Harold Blum said Freud is generally recognized as a \nfigure of immense cultural importance. He changed the way we \nunderstand drama, history, and biography and gave us a new picture of \nhow a person becomes a person. Do you agree?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is certainly true now. How long will this last? We do not know \nwhether this is a permanent contribution. But Freud has certainly \nmade the psychological understanding of people a phenomenon that \naffects our response to all those things: literature, drama, the \nhistory of a person, historical understanding, biographyall of that \nhas changed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs that influence on the wane?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, and for a number of reasons. While Freud's initial impact was \nprofound, it has been absorbed or completed. Also, psychotherapy \ntoday is preoccupied, on the one hand, with medication, and on the \nother hand, with behavioral and cognitive strategies for dealing with \nvery specialized symptoms and problems. Freud's influence is on the \nwane because he had nothing to contribute to the biochemical nature \nof mental problems or to the behavioral and cognitive strategies of \ndealing with particular anxieties or phobias. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo there is no revival of psychoanalysis, as far as you can tell, \namong your colleagues.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot as far as I can tell. Psychoanalysis is continuing to feel the \nimpact of its critics, and its influence is steadily dwindling. For \nexample, 30 years ago most of the departments of psychiatry in the \nmedical schools were headed up by a Freudian. Today, I do not know if \nany are. It is all neuroscience/biochemistry in psychiatry. There \nhaven't been any major new psychoanalytic ideas for quite some time. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps equally significant is the impact of health maintenance \norganizations. HMOs have had a negative impact on all forms of \nlong-term psychotherapy because they simply will not pay for it. \nThey'll give you seven, maybe fourteen, sessions, and that means that \nthere is a terrific emphasis on short-term, positive results. So the \npeople who are in psychoanalysis today largely must pay for it out of \ntheir own pocket. Its primary appeal today is to people who want an \nintellectual understanding of themselves and of the world from the \nperspective of psychoanalysis, a kind of psychological Stoicism \nimbued with the tragic view of life. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou say that Freud's intellectual credibility is on the wane, but his \ninfluence is everywhere in the popular cultureespecially in the way \nwe see our own personal past, and in the way we view sexuality. Are \nthere any positive insights that we have gained from Freud?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe invented a number of major approaches. He invented the notion of \npsychotherapy, the \"talking cure,\" as we understand it today. He \nbrought attention to the importance of early childhood, namely the \neffects of trauma, distortion, and other phenomena in the first three \nyears of life. His primary focus on child development was from the \nthird year on, but he did talk about the earlier years as well, and \nlater psychoanalysts have developed many theories based on the first \ntwo years of life. He was the first to show that the kind of bendings \nthat take place in childhood can lead to later mental pathologies. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is positive because it has made us much more aware of the impact \nof childhood experience and its long-term consequences. The only \npsychological interpretations we have of early childhood traumas as \ndetermining later mental pathologies are a part of the psychoanalytic \ntradition of Freud. There are no Jungian theories of that. \nPsychoanalysis is the only game in town. \u0014\n\u0014\nWould you agree that one of the negative consequences of focusing on \nthe importance of early childhood is that, while gaining insights, \nsome people just stay there, and they blame irresponsible behavior on \nchildhood experiences, never seeming to move forward?\u0014\n\u0014\nAbsolutely. They become permanent victims stuck in the past and \nunable to move beyond it. They blame their parents or someone else \nfor their problems without seeing their own responsibility. We live \nat a time when Americans in general probably have a more benevolent \nenvironment than at any time in history, and yet, for millions of \npeople, we are a nation of victims. If it weren't so prevalent it \nwould be pathetic. \u0014\n\u0014\nWould Freud himself have encouraged people to gain insight and then \nmove on?\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't think Freud would have had much patience with the late \ntwentieth-century American wallowing in victimhood. In fact, I think \nit would have appalled him. A number of things he said indicate this. \nFirst, there is his aphorism \"Where Id was, Ego will be.\" Which is \nanother way of saying, once you understand what is going on, you put \nit in the realm of more conscious control. Another thing he once said \nwas \"the best psychoanalysis can do is to return the patient to the \nmore normal level of human misery.\" In other words, he knew there was \na normal level of human misery, that life is difficult, and that \nwhile psychoanalysis can help you get through some of the more knotty \nproblems, it will not alter the basic facts of our existence. Many \nAmericans think that if they are feeling bad, somebody is to blame. \u0014\n\u0014\nI would say that Freud had a tragic view of life. He believed that \nour response to life's tragedy should be like our response to a Greek \ntragedy. Knowledge is helpful for understanding. But let's face it: \nit is still a tragedy. \u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Lear, writing in The New Republic about the Freud \ncontroversy and the Library of Congress exhibit, said, \"The real \nobject of attack by Freud's critics is the very idea of humans having \nunconscious motivation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI do not think that is true. The critics are attacking a variety of \nthings. But certainly there are critics who, for example, deny that \n\"repression\" even exists. They acknowledge that you might have \ntrouble remembering early experiences, but they would argue that this \ndifficulty is just a memory retrieval problem based upon how far back \nthe event was in time, how you happened to code it, the absence of \nany verbal cues because, perhaps, you did not have a mastery of \nlanguage when this event occurred, and so on. They would contend that \nthere is no evidence for active rejection from the conscious mind; no \nact of repression, if you will.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you believe that humans are guided by unconscious motivation?\u0014\n\u0014\nUnconscious motivation is an important factor in human behavior, but \nthe question we must first answer is whether it is the \"Freudian\" \nunconscious or some other kind of unconscious. For example, the \nFreudian unconscious is primarily sexual and often aggressive. It is \ninteresting that not one of the other later great psychologists, \nJung, or Adler, or Horney, or Rogers, or Maslow, emphasized the \nunconscious nearly as much as Freud did, and none of them emphasized \nsex to the degree that he did. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about other positive aspects of Freud's legacy?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has made us aware of the psychological complexity of human beings \nand the importance of the psychological life. This is both positive \nand negative. He has been part of the great movement in the last \ncentury from the objective to the subjective. I think the historical \njury is still out on the consequences of that. We're quite aware that \nwe have become so subjective that we're running into the danger of \nthe loss of any notion of objective truth. On the other hand, he may \nhave made available to the Christian world an understanding of the \ninterior life that begins psychologically and develops spiritually; \nthat is, he has made us aware of the whole domain from which the \nspiritual life can naturally evolve. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany people did not understand the notion of our psychological \ninterior. Freud has made it clear what that interior might look like. \nNow most of this is psychological, of course, not spiritual, but this \nunderstanding could be a kind of preparation for moving from the \npsychological interior life to the spiritual interior life. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat were his negative contributions?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are several negative features to Freud's legacy. First, he \nemphasized sexuality way past its natural importance. Second, he \nemphasized that sexuality was always repressed and that it was \ndesirable if it was brought into the open. Over time this doctrine \nhas led to our pornographic culture. He was the first to argue that \nrepressed sexuality was at the source of neurosisa theory that \ngained wide acceptance and had a far-reaching cultural influence \ndespite the lack of any supporting evidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe also heavily emphasized the past as a deterministic system. Here \nhe was simply assimilating the prevailing nineteenth-century model of \ncausality and applying it to human behavior. He was inconsistent; he \ndid not apply this model in everyday life. So, for instance, in his \ndisputes with former friends and associates, such as Jung and Adler, \nhe did not excuse their behavior as the result of past experiences. \nBut he provided a logic for the notion that we are not responsible \nfor our behavior. One of the things psychology, psychotherapy, and \npsychoanalysis have done is to introduce the idea that people are not \nresponsible for a large amount of their behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis takes away any formal judgment of irresponsible behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nRight. It is not your fault but your father's fault, or your \nunconscious early trauma, or your mother's fault, and so forth. We \nneed to say, \"Yes, you have this pressure to deal with. Now deal with \nit.\" That is one of the foremost challenges for contemporary \npsychology: How do we bring responsibility back in without violating \nour ever-deepening understanding of the complexities of human \nexperience? \u0014\n\u0014\nAny other major negative contributions?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother thing is that everything becomes psychological. Psychology \nexpanded so that if you have an allergy, or asthma, or you are \nobsessive, or compulsive, this has a psychological origin. Psychology \ncan even explain religion, uncovering your religious motivation. \nPsychology lies behind every form of behavioral or medical pathology. \nThe pushing of psychology as the cause of everything is Freud's \nlegacy. The whole therapeutic mentality had its origins in Freud. \u0014\n\u0014\nFreud says in The Future of an Illusion that God was nothing but the \nwishful emotional clinging to a childhood father figure transformed \ninto a supernatural being. He says this: \"Men cannot remain children \nforever; they must go out into hostile life. We may call this \n'education to reality.' Need I confess to you that the sole purpose \nof my book is to point out the necessity for this forward step?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that there is no evidence for Freud's theory of \nreligion. I just finished a book on the psychological origins of \natheism, which should be published in 1999. I discovered a few \nimportant things about Freud's understanding of religion. First, \nthere is no published case in which Freud psychoanalyzed any patient \nwho was a believer at the time of the psychoanalysis. Second, there \nis no published case showing how such a belief in a client was \nsupposed to be the result of early childhood fantasies. \u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, Freud himself, who proposed the Oedipus Complex, said we \nshould all hate our father unconsciously and wish to replace him. If \nthat is the case, why would we replace him with a supernatural \nfather? In fact, Freud's theory clearly predicts that we should all \nbe atheists, because atheism is the desire to get rid of the Oedipal \nfather, and we should all have an unconscious, irrational, and \nneurotic basis for atheism. Hatred for the father should be the \nsource of atheism. By the way, in my book, I found a lot of evidence \nthat atheists do in fact show this psychology. \u0014\n\u0014\nFreud's idea that belief in God is childish while letting go of God \nis a form of maturity, is widespread in our culture. However, it is \nthis rejection of God that is really adolescent. All modernism can be \nseen as a giant adolescent rebellion, with a focus on sex and \naggression. As we mature and come out of it, we recover the wisdom of \nchildhood. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs there anything else we need to learn from Freud?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity has always been, in many respects, about healing. Not \njust physical healing in the hospital, but also emotional healing. It \nis probably no accident that about the time mainline churches began \nignoring this, about a hundred years ago, a new form of emotional \nhealingthis time secularcame into being. In other words, liberal \nChristian theology and religion ignored the healing power of the \nfaith. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne person who saw this clearly was Jung, who said that he hardly \nknew anyone 35 or older who wasn't facing a religious crisis. But \nwhere religion was truly functioning in people's lives, neurotic \nproblems were dramatically less. So, Jung said, I have to take over \nthe role, strictly speaking, of theologian or priest. And he did just \nthis, but in a perverse fashion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a huge psychological need for healing that the churches had \nneglected, and so the secular world picked it up and ran with it. Now \nI see the churches waking up on this issue. \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Cromartie directs the Evangelical Studies Project at the \nEthics and Public Policy Center in Washington. D.C.\u0014",

During\u0014\n                                  his 30-year career, he was a \nsought-after counselor and confidant,\u0014\n                                  and for a number of years he worked \nclosely with young people in\u0014\n                                  his California diocese. At the time \nof his arrest, prosecutors charged\u0014\n                                  him with 17 counts of child sexual \nabuse. Most of those counts were\u0014\n                                  dropped because the statute of \nlimitations had run out, but Father X,\u0014\n                                  who claims he had undergone \nextensive counseling and treatment\u0014\n                                  and was on the road to recovery \nwhen he was arrested, eventually\u0014\n                                  pleaded guilty to one felony charge \nof committing lewd and\u0014\n                                  lascivious acts with a minor under \nthe age of 14 and one\u0014\n                                  misdemeanor count of molesting a \nchild, and was sentenced to eight\u0014\n                                  years in prison. While serving his \ntime, he wrote two books, both\u0014\n                                  critiques of the American \ncorrections system, under the pseudonym\u0014\n                                  A. Companion. He was released on \nparole a little more than a year\u0014\n                                  ago. Now in his 60s, he must \nregister as a sex offender on each\u0014\n                                  birthday for the rest of his life. \nHe expresses deep remorse for his\u0014\n                                  acts and agreed to speak with \nTime's Peter Meyer so that \"others\u0014\n                                  might be helped.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  In the Beginning \u0014\n                                  I was probably eight years into my \npriesthood when I had my first\u0014\n                                  abusive contact with a child. \nPhysical touch was often all that I\u0014\n                                  needed or wanted. Just closeness. \nMy arm around him. But the\u0014\n                                  sexual need  or lust, I'm not sure \nhow to explain it  would just\u0014\n                                  kick in, and I would find myself \ntouching and fondling genitals. The\u0014\n                                  boys were junior high age, \nbasically. Their ages were 11 or 12, for\u0014\n                                  the most part, maybe 13. But any \nkid who showed affection or\u0014\n                                  showed that he liked me was \nprobably vulnerable. And, of course,\u0014\n                                  that happens very naturally with a \npriest and especially with kids at\u0014\n                                  that age. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  What Went Wrong \u0014\n                                  I grew up in a very good family. \nThere was no abuse, no addiction. I\u0014\n                                  have a younger brother and sister, \nand they have been wonderful\u0014\n                                  throughout this; my nieces and \nnephews too. But looking back from a\u0014\n                                  therapeutic perspective, I am very \nmuch like my mother, who was a\u0014\n                                  housewife and who didn't share what \nwas going on inside. My dad, a\u0014\n                                  blue-collar worker, was more \noutgoing, but sharing didn't happen\u0014\n                                  with him either. I think it was the \ntimes. These kinds of personal\u0014\n                                  things were kept private. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  I think I knew I was homosexual, on \nsome level, but I would never\u0014\n                                  really allow myself to say that \nabout myself. And it surely wasn't a\u0014\n                                  topic for discussion  except in \njokes. Basically, I never grew beyond\u0014\n                                  junior high from a \npsychosexual-development point of view. That\u0014\n                                  was when I began having to really \nexperience my own sexual\u0014\n                                  feelings and was very confused \nabout it. But there were no resources\u0014\n                                  to help me. When I entered the \nseminary, it was to escape a girl\u0014\n                                  friend who wanted to get married. I \nfigured I'd go in the seminary for\u0014\n                                  six months, and that would end \nthat, and I'd come out and figure out\u0014\n                                  what to do with my life. But I \nstayed. And in the seminary, of course,\u0014\n                                  there was no chance to develop \nintimacy, no discussion of sexuality.\u0014\n                                  We didn't even cover it as a \ntheological treatise. I was convinced\u0014\n                                  that the grace of ordination was \ngoing to give me that last push to\u0014\n                                  get my whole sexual life together, \nand I was going to be a changed\u0014\n                                  person and would live happily ever \nafter. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  I remember shortly after arriving \nat my first assignment, walking down\u0014\n                                  the rectory hallway  I don't think \nI'd been there even a month \u0014\n                                  and I peered into a mirror. I had \nmy collar on. As I looked, I said to\u0014\n                                  myself, \"You're the same as you \nwere a month ago, except now\u0014\n                                  you're a priest.\" And that was a \nreally big moment, a profound\u0014\n                                  moment. It was trouble. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  From Intimacy To Lust \u0014\n                                  What would bring it on? I don't \nknow, maybe fatigue, maybe stress.\u0014\n                                  But I know that I worked seven days \na week, 16 hours a day, as a\u0014\n                                  priest. I didn't take a day off. \nBut I was very good. That's how I got\u0014\n                                  my identity. That's how I got my \nfulfillment. I was a good priest who\u0014\n                                  did amazing things, but I didn't \nhave a personal life. Among my\u0014\n                                  many priestly activities, I worked \nclosely with children. My reaching\u0014\n                                  out to them was not to harm them. I \nwas reaching out for affection,\u0014\n                                  for intimacy, reaching out to \nbelong, to have somebody who would\u0014\n                                  be my friend, in the sense of what \nI didn't have. I was their age, on\u0014\n                                  one level. The physical contact, \nthe touch, was not in the strictest\u0014\n                                  sense sexual. But the lust would \ntake over at a certain point. I didn't\u0014\n                                  see the casual physical contact as \nwrong. But when I would go to the\u0014\n                                  genital contact, I had no doubt \nabout that being wrong. I didn't think\u0014\n                                  of it as harmful, really, but I \nknew it was morally wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  The Confessional Cover-Up \u0014\n                                  I'd go to confession; there would \nbe genuine repentance; and then I\u0014\n                                  would go for a period of time \nwithout molesting anyone. I would\u0014\n                                  make a very real point when this \nwas having to be confessed to go to\u0014\n                                  another diocese to make sure the \npriest didn't know me. What I was\u0014\n                                  after was the absolution, so that I \ncould pick up the pieces and go\u0014\n                                  on. I didn't see the big picture \nthat I certainly see now. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  The Unraveling \u0014\n                                  It was on a Saturday in the 1990s. \nThe bishop showed up at the\u0014\n                                  rectory. I was very surprised to \nsee him. And he said a couple of kids\u0014\n                                  had come to him and accused me of \nmolestation. I admitted to one\u0014\n                                  of the two, but the other wasn't \ntrue. By this time I had moved to the\u0014\n                                  point where I wasn't doing it \nanymore. I was feeling really positive\u0014\n                                  and hopeful. But when these boys \ncame forward and the bishop\u0014\n                                  came, everything changed. I said, \n\"What do you want me to do?\"\u0014\n                                  And he said, \"Well, I'd like you to \ngo into a program.\" I said, \"Fine. I\u0014\n                                  think I'd really like that.\" I was \nat the point where that sounded pretty\u0014\n                                  good to me. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  I don't know how things would have \nevolved ultimately, but it didn't\u0014\n                                  make much difference once it all \nwent public. When the old offenses\u0014\n                                  came out and were in the paper and \nthe whole thing started falling\u0014\n                                  apart, my progress didn't make any \ndifference to anyone but me,\u0014\n                                  because it wasn't going to change \nanything that had happened in\u0014\n                                  the past. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  What I've Learned \u0014\n                                  I am finally comfortable with who I \nam. But it has come at a terrible\u0014\n                                  cost. And what burdens me more than \nanything is, whatever good\u0014\n                                  has come out of this for me \npersonally  and there has been good,\u0014\n                                  because I don't think I've ever \nbeen more integrated than I am now\u0014\n                                   it is totally meaningless to the \npeople who are still hurting\u0014\n                                  because of me, directly or \nindirectly. Whatever benefit comes to me\u0014\n                                  is almost salt in their wounds, in \na sense. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  I've given up trying to think of a \nway to go back and make it all right.\u0014\n                                  There have been a few of these \nyoung people that I've talked to\u0014\n                                  because they have sought me out, \nand there has been a healing.\u0014\n                                  But I can't change the harm I did. \nI can't go back and make it right. I\u0014\n                                  spent many, many days and hours \ntrying to figure out how I could do\u0014\n                                  that  wishing it away, praying it \naway. It doesn't go away. And\u0014\n                                  that's a tremendous pain and \ntremendous injury done. And I\u0014\n                                  understand it now, really clearly. \nAnd it makes it all the harder to\u0014\n                                  carry it myself. It would be bad \nenough if I were the next-door\u0014\n                                  neighbor. But this is like God \ndoing it. Jesus doing it.\u0014",

    "words": "Faith in America\u0014\n                      It's as important as ever, no matter what you \nbelieve\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Jeffery L. Sheler\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Since the arrival of the first Christian \npilgrims in colonial times, Americans\u0014\n                      have defined themselves as a \"nation under \nGod.\" In times of peace and\u0014\n                      prosperity as well as in war and tragedy, the \nnation and its leaders have paid\u0014\n                      homage to the God many believe is the author \nand sustainer of life and\u0014\n                      liberty. And they have ordered their lives and \nlaws according to widely shared\u0014\n                      principles informed by a rich tapestry of \nreligious traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today, the nation's historic reservoir of faith \nfaces new and daunting\u0014\n                      challenges in a world shaken by terrorism, \nethnic strife, and economic\u0014\n                      uncertaintyand by the stinging disappointment \nof clergy scandals.\u0014\n                      Yet there are few signs of a concomitant waning \nof the profound religious\u0014\n                      character that has defined the United States \nfrom the beginning. A new U.S.\u0014\n                      News/PBS's Religion & Ethics Newsweekly poll \nsuggests that the wealthiest,\u0014\n                      most powerful, and best-educated nation on \nEarth still is one of the most\u0014\n                      religiousbut in some intriguing new ways. \nNearly two thirds of Americans\u0014\n                      say religion is very important in their lives, \nand close to half say they attend\u0014\n                      worship services at least once a weekthe \nhighest percentages since at\u0014\n                      least the 1960s. Other surveys continue to show \nbelief in God and devotion\u0014\n                      to prayer at historic highs. And voluntary \ngiving to religious\u0014\n                      institutionsestimated at more than $55 billion \nannuallyexceeds the gross\u0014\n                      national product of many countries. From a \nstorefront tabernacle in South\u0014\n                      Central Los Angeles to a Gothic cathedral in \nupper Manhattan, there are\u0014\n                      more churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques \nper capita in the\u0014\n                      United States than in any other nation on \nEarth: one for about every 865\u0014\n                      people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meanwhile, many Americans seek spiritual \nsustenance beyond organized\u0014\n                      religion, in personal experiences and \nmeditative practices. More than 4 of 5\u0014\n                      Americans say they have \"experienced God's \npresence or a spiritual force\"\u0014\n                      close to them, and 46 percent say it has \nhappened many times. \"People are\u0014\n                      reaching out in all directions in their attempt \nto escape from the seen world to\u0014\n                      the unseen world,\" explains pollster George \nGallup Jr. \"There is a deep\u0014\n                      desire for spiritual mooringsa hunger for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet while the United States may well be, as \nmany experts claim, the most\u0014\n                      religious of the Western democracies, it also \nis becoming the most\u0014\n                      religiously diverseand tolerant. Since the \nImmigration Act of 1965\u0014\n                      eliminated quotas linked to national origin, \nMuslims, Buddhists, Hindus,\u0014\n                      Sikhs, Jains, Zoroastrians, and others have \narrived in increasing numbers,\u0014\n                      dramatically altering the religious landscape \nof many communities. As\u0014\n                      Harvard Divinity School Prof. Diana Eck points \nout in A New Religious America,\u0014\n                      members of religions now live \"not just on the \nother side of the world, but in\u0014\n                      our neighborhoods; Hindu children go to school \nwith Jewish children;\u0014\n                      Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs work side by side \nwith Protestants and\u0014\n                      Catholics.\" Though the numbers of \nnon-Christians are relatively smallabout\u0014\n                      6.5 percent of the U.S. populationtheir \nvisibility and influence are growing.\u0014\n                      Nationwide, there are now more Buddhists than \nPresbyterians and nearly as\u0014\n                      many Muslims as Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The kind of pluralism we're seeing today is \nunheard of,\" says Gary\u0014\n                      Laderman, a religion professor at Emory \nUniversity in Atlanta, \"and we don't\u0014\n                      know what the response is going to be.\" Yet it \nalready is becoming clear, say\u0014\n                      Laderman, Eck, and others, that Americans of \nthe 21st century can no longer\u0014\n                      appeal to a shared \"Judeo-Christian heritage\" \nin navigating the contentious\u0014\n                      issues that arise in a free and democratic \nsociety. \"When you begin to think\u0014\n                      of yourself as a \nJudeo-Christian-Islamic-Hindu-Buddhist culture,\" says\u0014\n                      Laderman, \"how do you strike a balance in civic \nreligion that's going to\u0014\n                      accommodate everyone?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The changing complexion of American religion \nalready has worked its way\u0014\n                      into the public discourse. From President Bush \non down, elected officials\u0014\n                      accustomed to lauding America's churches and \nsynagogues now routinely\u0014\n                      include \"mosques.\" At the White House and in \nsome governors' mansions,\u0014\n                      ceremonies honoring Islam's holy month of \nRamadan are increasingly\u0014\n                      commonplace. And Muslim and Hindu clerics have \njoined ministers, priests,\u0014\n                      and rabbis in offering opening prayers at \nlegislative sessions and city\u0014\n                      council meetingsalthough not always without \ncontroversy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, despite sporadic assaults directed at \nreligious minorities, experts say\u0014\n                      extreme xenophobia is generally rare and mild \nin comparison with the\u0014\n                      violence common in some parts of the world. \nIndeed, the U.S. News/PBS\u0014\n                      surveyconducted last month by Mitofsky \nInternational and Edison Media\u0014\n                      Researchfound a high degree of acceptance \ntoward people of different\u0014\n                      faiths. More than three fourths of Americans \ncall the nation's religious\u0014\n                      diversity a source of strength; fewer than a \nthird think it makes it harder to\u0014\n                      keep the country united. (There is, however, a \nnew suspicion of Islam: 37\u0014\n                      percent say they have an unfavorable view of \nthat religion, while nearly 40\u0014\n                      percent think Islam harbors more violent \nextremists than do other religions.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tolerance. Meanwhile, more than 3 in 4 \nAmericans believe all religions have\u0014\n                      at least some elements of trutheven though few \nsay they know much about\u0014\n                      religions other than their own. And nearly 70 \npercent think spiritual\u0014\n                      experiences are the most important part of \nreligion. \"If one's religion is more\u0014\n                      about individual identity than doctrine or \ncreed, it's a lot easier to be tolerant,\"\u0014\n                      says Egon Mayer, a sociologist at the Graduate \nCenter of the City University\u0014\n                      of New York. Gallup says that the high degree \nof religious tolerance reflects,\u0014\n                      in part, \"not only a lack of knowledge of other \nreligions but an ignorance of\u0014\n                      one's own faith.\" In some polls, he says, \"you \nhave Christians saying, 'Yes,\u0014\n                      Jesus is the only way' and also, 'Yes, there \nare many paths to God.' It's not\u0014\n                      that Americans don't believe anything; they \nbelieve everything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In some denominations, the growing diversity \nalready has spawned internal\u0014\n                      debate over basic doctrines. Recently, both \nRoman Catholics and\u0014\n                      Presbyterians have wrestled publicly with the \nquestion: Is Jesusand\u0014\n                      Christianitythe only way of salvation? The \nVatican reprimanded a Belgian\u0014\n                      theologian last year for suggesting in a book \non religious pluralism that\u0014\n                      salvation might be achieved other than through \nthe Catholic Church. And\u0014\n                      after a passionate debate, leaders of the 2.5 \nmillion-member Presbyterian\u0014\n                      Church (USA) rejected a statement declaring \n\"Jesusis the only savior and\u0014\n                      Lord\" and affirmed instead that \"for us, the \nassurance of salvation is found\u0014\n                      only in confessing Christ and trusting him \nalone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The growing diversity also has raised pressure \non some groups to halt\u0014\n                      aggressive proselytizing. Southern Baptists, \nfor example, have been widely\u0014\n                      criticized in recent years for targeting \nHindus, Jews, and others for\u0014\n                      conversion during those religions' holy days. \n\"That doesn't sit well with many\u0014\n                      people who want to celebrate American religious \nfreedom,\" says Laderman\u0014\n                      of Emory University. In the U.S. News/PBS poll, \n71 percent, including 70\u0014\n                      percent of Christians, say Christians should be \ntolerant of people of other\u0014\n                      faiths and leave them alone. Just 22 percent \n(24 percent of Christians) think\u0014\n                      it's a Christian's duty to convert members of \nother faiths. \"I certainly believe\u0014\n                      we ought to be tolerant in terms of respecting \nother people's faiths,\" says\u0014\n                      James Merritt, president of the 15.9 \nmillion-member Southern Baptist\u0014\n                      Convention. But for a Christian, he says, \nproselytizing \"is not an option. I'm\u0014\n                      as obligated to share my faith in Christ as I \nam to pay taxes. All we ask is that\u0014\n                      you be tolerant of our right and responsibility \nto share what we believe to be\u0014\n                      the real truth of salvation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whatever effect the nation's religious \nnewcomers may have in shaping\u0014\n                      American culture, experts say, is likely to \npale in comparison to the strong\u0014\n                      cultural influences the new religious \ncommunities will face as they adapt to\u0014\n                      their new surroundings. In their 1990 book, One \nNation Under God,\u0014\n                      sociologists Barry Kosmin and Seymour Lachman \ndescribed a \"process of\u0014\n                      Americanization\" at work on minority religions \nin the United States. Catholics,\u0014\n                      Jews, and other groups \"have become more \nindividualistic,\" reflecting\u0014\n                      attributes of the majority Protestant culture. \nLike Protestants, said Kosmin\u0014\n                      and Lachman, \"they are less reliant on \nauthority and less submissive to a\u0014\n                      hierarchical structure than their forebears \nwere.\" Thus, polls consistently\u0014\n                      show that American Catholics, for example, are \nfar more inclined to follow\u0014\n                      their own consciences rather than church \nteachings on matters like birth\u0014\n                      control and divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the long run, learning to live together \npeacefully and productively, experts\u0014\n                      say, will require greater personal engagement \nwith people of other faiths.\u0014\n                      \"Tolerance is a good beginning, but it's not \nenough,\" says Eck, who heads\u0014\n                      Harvard's Pluralism Project, aimed at mapping \nreligious diversity and\u0014\n                      promoting interfaith relations. \"You can \ntolerate people you know nothing\u0014\n                      about and basically maintain religious \nghettos.\" Even so, some are leery of\u0014\n                      participating in interfaith activities that \nsuggest that one path to God is as\u0014\n                      good as another. \"We want it understood that \nChristians, Buddhists, and\u0014\n                      Muslims are not praying to the same god,\" says \nRichard Cizik, vice president\u0014\n                      of the National Association of Evangelicals, \nwhose 51 denominations\u0014\n                      represent 10 million Christians. \"Allah,\" he \nsays, \"is not Jehovah.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With such widely divergent views, not only on \nbasic religious beliefs but on\u0014\n                      the value and necessity of forging strong \ninterfaith ties, navigating the new\u0014\n                      religious landscape may be perilous. \"It was \neasy to do when we thought of\u0014\n                      ourselves as a nation of Catholics, \nProtestants, and Jews,\" says Emory's\u0014\n                      Laderman. Now, he says, \"it's going to be \ndifficult to find the glue that holds it\u0014\n                      all together.\" The real challenge, says Eck, \nwill be \"to create a multireligious\u0014\n                      and democratic state\"something that has never \nbeen done before. Still, it is\u0014\n                      a task that the world's most religiously \ndiverse nation may not be able to\u0014\n                      ignore for long.\u0014",

    "words": "Flogged and Deported\u0014\nWhat you can do to help persecuted Christians in Saudi Arabia.\u0014\nBy Jeff M. Sellers | posted 05/07/2002 Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nSaudi Arabian authorities on January 28 lashed three Ethiopian \nChristians 80 times each with a flexible metal cable in front of more \nthan 1,000 detainees. The three Christians (whom authorities were \nabout to deport because of their faith) smuggled a letter out of the \nBremen Deportation Prison in Jeddah to describe their treatment. \nOfficials beat and kicked them before suspending them with chains and \nflogging them, and Saudi authorities denied them medical care for \nback wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our bodies are wounded, swollen, terribly bruised, and with great \npain,\" Baharu Mengistu, Tinsaie Gizachew, and Gebeyehu Tefera wrote \nto Washington, D.C.based International Christian Concern and other \nagencies.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Baharu's kidney may have been damaged, and he is passing blood with \nhis urine,\" they wrote. \"When we reported to the prison hospital for \ntreatment, we were slapped and told to come back after we were dead. \nIt seems as if we were brought [here] to be tortured and tormented to \ndeath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMengistu received limited medical care two days later. Authorities \ndeported him on February 2, according to Middle East Concern (MEC) of \nLoughborough, United Kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaudi officials arrested the three Ethiopians and 11 other foreign \nworkers last summer. At press time most of them had been deported. \nAuthorities never formally charged them with wrongdoing.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinistry of Interior officials began rounding up the 14 house-church \nleaders after a citizen complained about foreign Christians renting a \npublic hall for a farewell party on June 2.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaudi Arabia prohibits public worship by members of faiths other than \nSunni Islam. The regime allows the country's 7 million foreign \nworkers, about one-third of the population, to worship in private. \nMuslims who convert to another religion can be punished by death. Of \nthe country's 807,000 Christians, all but a smattering are foreigners.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Freedom of religion does not exist\" in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. State \nDepartment notes in its 2001 report on religious freedom. Even so, as \na U.S. ally in the region, Saudi Arabia has been sensitive to U.S. \npressure and has improved its treatment of Christians in the past few \nyears, according to MEC Director Daniel Hoffman.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This improvement is due mainly to the fact that the Saudi \nauthorities 'burned their fingers' each time they acted against \nChristiansthey were put under a lot of pressure,\" Hoffman says. \"Now \nthey often feel it is not worth the hassle.\"\u0014",

    "words": "There is an Indian parable about this. A guru had a disciple and was \nso pleased with the man's spiritual progress that he left him on his \nown. The man lived in a little mud hut. He lived simply, begging for \nhis food. Each morning, after his devotions, the disciple washed his \nloincloth and hung it out to dry. One day, he came back to discover \nthe loincloth torn and eaten by rats. He begged the villagers for \nanother, and they gave it to him. But the rats ate that one, too. So \nhe got himself a cat. That took care of the rats, but now when he \nbegged for his food he had to beg for milk for his cat as well. \"This \nwon't do,\" he thought. \"I'll get a cow.\" So he got a cow and found he \nhad to beg now for fodder. So he decided to till and plant the ground \naround his hut. But soon he found no time for contemplation, so he \nhired servants to tend his farm. But overseeing the labors became a \nchore, so he married to have a wife to help him. After time, the \ndisciple became the wealthiest man in the village. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe guru was traveling by there and stopped in. He was shocked to see \nthat where once stood a simple mud hut there now loomed a palace \nsurrounded by a vast estate, worked by many servants. \"What is the \nmeaning of this?\" he asked his disciple. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"You won't believe this, sir,\" the man replied. \"But there was no \nother way I could keep my loincloth.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Fertile Soil \u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is a fourth kind of soil. There is the seed that falls upon \nthe\u0014\ngood earth and takes root and grows to maturity. This crop, we are \ntold, is\u0014\na harvest that will bear fruit a hundredfold. Jesus mentions this last\u0014\nbecause it is the thrust of the story. True, there are failures, but \nthe\u0014\ngood news is that there is also victory.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, here is the hard part. Our efforts in life are not always \nmeasurable.\u0014\nSometimes, you may not see the final product. You may not see the \nactual\u0014\nharvest. Sometimes all we can do is plant a seed, and trust that God \nwill do\u0014\nthe rest. A school teacher works with a troubled child, but she may \nnot know\u0014\nhow the story ultimately turns out. All she can do is plant a seed of \nlove\u0014\nand trust that God will do the rest. Sometimes just a word of \nencouragement\u0014\nto a person in need, or a shared personal thought and someone picks \nup on it\u0014\nand it gets them through a dark night.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't ever underestimate the power of a seed. Did you know that in \n1959\u0014\nthere were 1 million Roman Catholics and 600,000 Protestants in \nChina. That\u0014\nmay sound like a lot but when you compare it to a population that is \nrapidly\u0014\napproaching 1 billion, you understand what a tiny seed that \nrepresented.\u0014\nThen in 1959 China closed it doors to the outside world. Many people \nbegan\u0014\nto wrap a burial shroud around the Christian church in China. They \nsaid that\u0014\nit would never survive. Then in 1979 China again opened its doors to \nthe\u0014\nWest and to the rest of the world. And a strange thing had happened. \nThat\u0014\ntiny seed 20 years earlier had taken root. The number of Roman \nCatholics\u0014\nduring those dark years rose from 1 million to 3 million and the \nnumber of\u0014\nProtestants rose from 600,000 to 3 million. The church in a time of\u0014\npersecution and hardship, had grown 53% in a twenty year period. How \ndo you\u0014\nexplain it? Fertile soil! There was obviously a hunger for the gospel.\u0014",

    "words": "Franklin Graham Speaks Before He Thinks\u0014\n\u0014\n BY Robert Parham\u0014\n\u0014\n Franklin Graham needs to apologize to Islamic leaders for his \nrepeated\u0014\n misstatements of fact.\u0014\n\u0014\n His criticism of Islam fertilizes the fields of hostility among \nconservative\u0014\n Christians toward Muslims. His unnecessary attacks choke the efforts \nof\u0014\n thoughtful Christians to foster an ethos of meaningful interfaith \ndialogue.\u0014\n\u0014\n In an effort to promote his new book, Graham has charged Islamic \nclerics\u0014\n with silence about the Sept. 11 attacks and called the Qur'an a book \nof\u0014\n violence.\u0014\n\u0014\n Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham and the heir of the Billy \nGraham\u0014\n Evangelistic Association, told Beliefnet.com, \"I believe the Qur'an \nteaches\u0014\n violence. It doesn't teach peace, it teaches violence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \"There has been silence from the Muslim clerics. There has not been\u0014\n denouncing of what happened here in New York City at the World Trade\u0014\n Center,\" Graham said, repeating charges he made earlier in \nWashington D.C.,\u0014\n Minneapolis and Charlotte.\u0014\n\u0014\n Graham said, \"There has not been condemnation by the clerics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Following the interview with Graham, which appeared on Monday, \nBeliefnet\u0014\n carried a series of statements from Islamic leaders and \norganizations which\u0014\n had responded with condemnation to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n For example, the grand imam of al-Alzhar University of Cairo, \nMohammed\u0014\n Sayyed Tantawi, said, \"The killing of men, women and children is a \nhorrible\u0014\n and brutal action, which cannot be approved by the monotheist \nreligions nor\u0014\n by sane men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a renowned Muslim scholar, denounced the \nattacks\u0014\n and urged Muslims to donate blood to the victims. He said, \"Islam, \nthe\u0014\n religion of tolerance, holds the human soul in high esteem, and \nconsiders\u0014\n the attack against innocent human beings a grave sin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Syria's senior Islamic leader said, \"Its not courage in any way to \nkill an\u0014\n innocent person, or to kill thousands of people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n In a joint statement, a number of American-Islamic groups said, \n\"American\u0014\n Muslims utterly condemn what are vicious and cowardly acts of \nterrorism\u0014\n against innocent civilians. We join with all Americans in calling \nfor the\u0014\n swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. No political \ncause\u0014\n could ever be assisted by such immoral acts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Beliefnet's compilation of quotations discloses that Islamic leaders \nhave\u0014\n criticized the terrorist attacks, contrary to Graham's claims.\u0014\n\u0014\n At the very worst, Graham bears false witness against Islamic \nleaders. At\u0014\n the very best, he reveals a blind ignorance. Either way, his \nleadership of\u0014\n one of the most trusted organizations within evangelical \nChristianity should\u0014\n be questioned. He lacks discernment, and appears to be backpedaling \nfrom a\u0014\n constructive interfaith perspective into the cultural castle of \nChristian\u0014\n fundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n When asked how he differed from his father, Graham told Beliefnet, \n\"I'm\u0014\n probably a little quicker to say what I think. It's always good to \nthink\u0014\n before you speak.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Graham would do well to follow his own advice.\u0014\n\u0014\n Robert Parham is BCE's executive director.\u0014",

    "title": "FATAL REVELATIONS - CHILDREN DYING",
    "words": "Fatal Revelations\u0014\n\u0014\nMassachusetts battles parents in tiny sect after two children die.\u0014\nBy Bob Smietana in Attleboro, Massachusetts | posted 05/03/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nAttleboro, Massachusetts, a city of 42,000 on the border with Rhode \nIsland, is witnessing a troubling clash between the rights of parents \nand the responsibility of the state to protect children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe parents of newborn Jeremiah Corneau and 11-month-old Samuel \nRobidoux are accused of allowing them to die. The two sets of parents \nsay the boys died in accordance with God's will. State prosecutors \ncharge that the parents, not God, are responsible. Samuel's parents, \nJacques and Karen Robidoux, face a murder trial that starts this \nmonth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah's parents, Rebecca and David Corneau, have not been charged \nwith a crime. The state has, however, taken their other four children \ninto protective custody. In addition, a juvenile court judge in \nFebruary ordered the Corneaus jailed for refusing to disclose the \nwhereabouts of a baby officials believe was born in late 2001. The \nCorneaus say Rebecca had a miscarriage but refuse to disclose the \nlocation of the child's body. State officials suspect that the child \nis alive and being hidden by family members.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth families belong to The Body, a small, insular sect whose members \nembrace faith healing and reject modern medicine. Members believe \nthey receive direct revelations from God. Sect founders Roland \nRobidoux and Roger Daneau were members of an Attleboro Bible study \nthat evolved into a group of about 20 adult members at its peak in \nthe 1980s. Most members come from their two families. Daneau, 62, was \nfound dead March 7 of an apparent heart attack at the sect's communal \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case has raised important legal questions about state \nintervention in the lives of fervently religious families. \nConstitutional scholar Stephen L. Carter of Yale Law School believes \nthat while parents should have wide latitude in raising their \nchildren, the state must set some limits.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Although I am a strong advocate of respecting parental authority in \ncreating even a very insular religious and moral world for their \nchildren, I also believe that a civilized society must place some \nlimits,\" Carter told CT. \"The law generally places the limit at the \nwell-being of the child.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInside a sect\u0014\n\u0014\nBody member Michelle Mingo believed she received a revelation from \nGod about Karen Robidoux in early 1999. According to journals the \ngroup kept, God was angry with Karen for being \"vain.\" As a penance, \nshe was to drink a gallon of high-fat almond milk. She was also to \nstop giving solid foods to her 10-month-old son, Samuel, who was \nstill nursing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt soon became apparent that Samuel was not getting enough \nnourishment, and he slowly lost weight during the next six weeks. \nWhen Karen, then 23, began to ask questions, members told her that \nSatan was tempting her to doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to one journal entry, God asks Karen: \"When are you going \nto believe me? It would please me if you took Samuel and left him in \nthe palm of my hand. Fear not and believe. I don't care about Samuel. \nI don't care about the flesh. I don't care about Samuel right now. \nI'm working with you to believe without doubt.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel died a few days before his first birthday in April 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you have someone who is perceived to have a direct connection \nto Godand no checks and balances, no accountabilitythen anything \ngoes,\" says Robert Pardon, executive director of the New England \nInstitute of Religious Research (NEIRR) in Lakeville, Massachusetts. \n\"It's only by the grace of God that more children did not die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah Corneau died during childbirth later in 1999. While his \nparents say Jeremiah was stillborn, state officials believe he was \nborn alive but quickly asphyxiated. Authorities believe Jeremiah \nwould have survived if he had been born in a hospital. Roland and the \nother men from the sect buried the bodies of both children in Maine's \nBaxter State Park in late September.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey would have remained buried, and most likely undiscovered, had it \nnot been for Michelle Mingo's estranged husband, Dennis. A former \nmember of The Body, he took some of the group's journals and turned \nthem over to police. Investigators began a lengthy probe. When \nmembers refused to cooperate, several were jailed for contempt of \ncourt.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelping former members\u0014\n\u0014\nA breakthrough occurred in October 2000 when David Corneau told \nauthorities where the children were buried. Prosecutors had given him \nimmunity in the deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter finding the bodies, police charged Karen Robidoux with \nsecond-degree murder, Jacques with first-degree murder, and Michelle \nMingo with being an accessory before the fact. Authorities took 13 of \nthe group's children into protective custody.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy all accounts, members of The Body lived simple lives before the \ndeaths of Samuel and Jeremiah, sharing a house in nearby Seekonk and \na gray duplex on Knight Avenue in Attleboro. The group would often \nspend evenings singing around the piano or in prayer meetings and \nBible studies.\u0014\n\u0014\nNEIRR's Pardon was appointed as guardian ad litem for the group's \nchildren. Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth Nasif asked Pardon to research \nThe Bodyto read through its journals and interview current and \nformer membersto help him make decisions about the children's future.\u0014\n\u0014\nPardon, a graduate of GordonConwell Theological Seminary and a \nformer Congregational minister, started NEIRR in 1991. In recent \nyears the institute has worked with former members of what Pardon \ncalls \"high-control destructive groups.\" The nonprofit ministry is \nhelping five members adjust to life outside the group.\u0014\n\u0014\nPardon believes Robidoux and Daneau had good intentions when they \nstarted. \"[T]hey were really trying to live a life that demonstrated \ntrue obedience to God,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nThings changed when members of the group read the works of a woman \nnamed Carol Balizet, Pardon says. Balizet runs Home in Zion \nMinistries of Tampa, Florida, which advocates home birth with no \nmedical intervention.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the same time, members of the group began to believe they were \nreceiving direct revelations from God. Eventually the visions came to \nhave more authority than the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Parents who choose to rely on the direct intervention of God to heal \ntheir children, without human intermediaries, are not crazy or evil,\" \nCarter says. \"They are doing what they believe the Lord requires. But \nthey are, in their innocence, pressing the bounds of religious \nfreedom beyond what a civilized society can allow, and that is why \nthey must not be permitted to do it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nState officials continue to be concerned about any new children of \nBody members. Rebecca Corneau was jailed in August 2000 for refusing \nto accept prenatal care while pregnant with her daughter Katarina. \nRebecca was released in October when her daughter was born and taken \ninto state custody. Neighbors reported that Corneau was pregnant \nagain in the fall of 2001, and the state's Department of Social \nServices began another investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Corneaus appeared before Nasif at Attleboro District Court \nin January, they refused to testify and received a two-week jail \nsentence. The Corneaus told Nasif on February 5 that the child died \nin a miscarriage. When they refused to reveal where the child was \nburied, Nasif jailed them for contempt.

    "title": "FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS",
    "words": "As with so many of the stories of Jesus, the parable of the debtors \narose\u0014\nout of a question that was posed to Jesus. Simon Peter said to him: \n\"Master,\u0014\nif my brother sins against me, how many times should I forgive him? \nSeven\u0014\ntimes? Even as he asks that question my mind cannot help but think \nabout\u0014\nchildren and how they will sometimes confess something they do wrong\u0014\nexpecting to get praise from a teacher or a parent because they were \nso\u0014\nhonest.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same sense, Simon Peter by asking this question is not \nexpecting\u0014\nrebuke but praise. He is expecting Jesus to say: \"Excellent Peter. \nYou go to\u0014\nthe head of the class. You get A+.\" According to Jewish law, Peter \nhad the\u0014\nright to think that he had done something good. Scribal law clearly \nread:\u0014\n\"If a man transgresses one time, forgive him. If a man transgresses \ntwo\u0014\ntimes, forgive him. If a man transgresses three times, forgive him. \nIf a man\u0014\ntransgresses four times, do not forgive him.\" What Peter has done is \nto take\u0014\nthis law of limited forgiveness, multiply it by two and add one, and \nthen\u0014\nsit back with a smile on his face and say: Now how is that for being \na great\u0014\nguy? And he surely must have been taken aback when Jesus said you must\u0014\nforgive seventy times seven.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Jesus proceeded to tell a story. There was a certain king who \nhad a day\u0014\nof reckoning for his servants. He found one who owed him 10,000 \ntalents and,\u0014\nbecause he could not pay, he was about to have him thrown into jail \nand his\u0014\nwife and children sold into slavery. In response to the man's pathetic\u0014\npleadings, however, he forgave him the entire debt.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereupon that forgiven servant went to a fellow servant who owed him \n100\u0014\ndenarii, a very small sum of money, and demanded payment. He pleaded \nfor\u0014\nextra time, an extension, but the man would not hear of it and he had \nhim\u0014\nthrown into jail. This story got back to the king who went into a \nrage. He\u0014\ncalled in the forgiven servant and said that because of his conduct, \nhe was\u0014\nnow to be thrown into jail. His original debt was reinstated.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow the question is, what was Jesus attempting to say to Simon Peter?\u0014\n\u0014\n1. First, forgiveness carries a heavy price.\u0014\n2. Second, a forgiven soul should be a forgiving soul.\u0014",

    "words": "Forgotten Soldiers of the Integration Fight\u0014\nBy WILLIAM DOYLE\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 1, Oxford, Miss., will be coming to terms with one \nof the major events of its past. Forty years ago on that day, in the \nearly morning, a force of nearly 30,000 American combat troops raced \ntoward Oxford in a colossal armada of helicopters, transport planes, \nJeeps and Army trucks. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheir mission was to save Oxford, the University of Mississippi and a \nsmall force of federal marshals from being destroyed by over 2,000 \nwhite civilians who were rioting after James Meredith, a black Air \nForce veteran, arrived to integrate the school.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe troops were National Guardsmen from little towns all over \nMississippi, regular Army men from across the United States and \nparatroopers from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.\u0014\nThey had to capture the city quickly; the F.B.I. had intelligence \nthat thousands of Klansmen and segregationists from California to \nGeorgia may have set off for Oxford, many of them armed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first troops to reach Oxford found over 100 wounded federal \nmarshals at the center of campus, 27 of them hit by civilian gunfire. \nPacks of hundreds of rioters swarmed the city, some holding war \ndances around burning vehicles.\u0014\n\u0014\nSnipers opened fire on the Army convoys and bricks struck the heads \nof American soldiers. Black G.I.'s in one convoy were ambushed by \nwhite civilians who tried to decapitate them in their open Jeeps with \nmetal pipes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaj. William Callicott of the Mississippi National Guard had served \nin World War II; he said he \"never was as terrified as I was going \nonto the campus that night.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was the fact that I knew there had to be some local people from \nmy hometown probably over there in that mob,\" Major Callicott said. \n\"That's what really worried me. If we killed anybody it could be my \nnext-door neighbor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Army troops restored order to the school and the city, block by \nblock. A girl watched a team of infantrymen under attack on the \nOxford town square and, according to a reporter at the scene, \nwondered aloud, \"When are they going to shoot back?\" Except for a few \nwarning shots, they never did.\u0014\nYet when the soldiers left the city a few weeks later, they marched \ninto oblivion. Most were under orders not to talk to the press. The \nCuban missile crisis unfolded just weeks later, wiping Oxford from \nthe front pages.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the troops did in Oxford was so courageous that their commanders \nnominated them for scores of medals. But an internal Army memo from \nMay 1963 states: \"The focus of additional attention on this incident \nwould not be in the best interest of the US Army or the nation. . . . \ndecorations should not be awarded for actions involving conflict \nbetween US Army units and other Americans.\" Memories of what the \ntroops did then faded away. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday, there will be an epilogue to this dramatic battle. \nOxford's mayor, Richard Howorth, and the city council of Oxford have \ntracked down as many of the troops of 1962 as they could and invited \nthem to the city to be honored as heroes. They will march back \nthrough Oxford's Courthouse Square to receive the official thanks of \nthe community they saved from destruction two generations ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Doyle is author of \"An American Insurrection: The Battle of \nOxford, Mississippi, 1962.\"\u0014",

    "words": "First-Century link to James, Jesus discovered\u0014\n\u0014\nAn October 22 Associated Press story reports that a burial box \nrecently discovered in Israel and dating to the first century could \nbe the oldest archaeological link to Jesus Christ, according to a \nFrench scholar whose findings were published. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn inscription in the Aramaic language - \"James, son of Joseph, \nbrother of Jesus\" - appears on an empty ossuary, a limestone burial \nbox for bones. \u0014\n\u0014\nAndre Lemaire said it's \"very probable\" the writing refers to Jesus \nof Nazareth. He dates the ossuary to A.D. 63, just three decades \nafter the crucifixion. Lemaire, a specialist in ancient inscriptions \nat France's Practical School of Higher Studies, published his \nfindings in the November/December issue of Biblical Archaeology \nReview. \u0014\n\u0014\nLemaire writes that the distinct writing style, and the fact that \nJews practiced ossuary burials only between 20 B.C. and A.D. 70, puts \nthe inscription squarely in the time of Jesus and James, who led the \nearly church in Jerusalem. All three names were commonplace, but \nLemaire estimates only 20 Jameses in Jerusalem during that era would \nhave had a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus. Moreover, \nnaming the brother as well as the father on an ossuary was \"very \nunusual,\" Lemaire wrote. There's only one other known example in \nAramaic. Thus, this particular Jesus must have had some unusual role \nor fame -- and Jesus of Nazareth certainly qualified, Lemaire \nconcluded. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus recorded that \"the \nbrother of Jesus the so-called Christ, James by name,\" was stoned to \ndeath as a Jewish heretic in A.D. 62. If his bones were placed in an \nossuary the inscription would have occurred the following year, \naround A.D. 63.

    "title": "FAREWELL TO GOD BY CHARLES TEMPLETON",
    "words": "Templeton has written an interesting book, documenting his own \nspiritual journey. However, many Christians who face the questions he \nraises about the Bible and Christian beliefs have been able to think \nthrough them without jettisoning their faith but by rethinking and \nrenewing their faith. Templeton raises nothing new. All the \ncriticisms have been raised before and reasonable explanations given. \nObviously, T. does not accept the explanations others have given. The \nBible is a very human book and thus T's criticisms. What T. fails to \nsee is that many Christians have come to accept the Bible's \nhumanness. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe miracle of divine revelation is that God has revealed himself \nthrough a very human book, warts and all. Many Christians do not need \nto affirm the Bible's inerrancy, infallibility, etc. T. fails to see \nthis. T. critiques the Bible as if it were written by a modern \nscientist or philosopher. The authors of the Bible thought \ndifferently. To expect them to have thought like modern \nscientists/philosphers and then to criticize them for it is to ignore \nthe cultural conditioning of both the Bible and modern ways of \nthinking. T. elevates modern scientific/rational-pholosophic ways of \nthinking as an absolute world view by which he judges the ancients -- \nwhat hubris! T. reads the Bible like the fundamentalist literalists \nhe criticizes. He fails to recognize that every type of literature \nmust be interpreted according to its type. \u0014\n\u0014\nMythology must be interpreted as mythology, not as scientific or \nphilosophic writing. Legend as legend. Poetry as poetry, etc. All \nthese kinds of literature can reveal truth. T. leaves little room for \nintuition as a means to understanding reality. Science and reason \ncannot explain everything. T. makes a lot of wild generalizations, \nusing statements such as \"an unbiased reading of the biblical account \nwill clearly show\" (p.38). T. sets up \"straw dogs\" or caricatures of \nwhat Christians believe and then tears the \"straw dog\"/caricature to \npieces. T's caricature of Christian theology and biblical \ninterpretation is basically that of a narrow-minded fundamentalism; \nit is not what most thinking Christians believe. Uunresolved anger \nappears to underly a lot of what T. says, e.g. the many perjorative \nadjectives used to describe the people and the caricatured beliefs \nthat T. doesn't like. Quite a bit of what T. asserts about the Bible \nand Christian theology is factually incorrect and unfortunately the \nreader untrained in Bible or theology will not know this. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn objective presentation would have debated the various viewpoints \non an issue; T. only gives his own position and does not allow those \nhe criticizes to speak. The objectivity T. espouses is lost in \nemotion, perjoratives, misinterpretations, and factual errors. A much \nbetter defence of agnosticism could be, and has been, given by \nothers. T's book is useful as an insight into his own spiritual \npilgrimage. Many of the criticisms he raises need to be raised, but \nhe does not deal with all the positive things which have come as a \nresult of belief in God or a responsible interpretation of the Bible. \nT's book might be more accurately titled \"Farewell to Templeton's \nConstruct and Caricature of Who/What God Is and What the Bible \nMeans.\" If God is what T. thinks God is and if the Bible means what \nT. thinks it means, then farewell, but thankfully there are other \noptions.\u0014\n----------------------------------------------------\u0014\nI bought Templeton's book at the same time I bought Les Strobel's \"A \nCase for Faith,\" to aid me in my quest for understanding of religion. \nTempleton's book uses simple logic to raise questions about Biblical \nstories (i.e. if God is all-knowing, why at sometimes does he know \nall and at others he has to \"come down\" to the site?; did Noah really \nsave two of every insect?; if God is all-loving, why does He chose to \nsave less than one-sixth of all humans ... is that the act of a \nloving god?). \u0014\n\u0014\nHis logic is solid. It does not need to use much historical fact \nbecause the Biblical and religious stories he discusses don't, \neither. Their only source is the Bible (naming historical figues who \nlived or historical, non-Biblical events that occurred doesn't count \nas \"proof\" of religious stories). In fact, I am somewhat puzzled by \nsome of the reviews here that dismiss Templeton because he doesn't \nhave some magical insight into Biblical history, complete with facts \nand figures. Templeton is asking only that the reader consider what \nis being said or done in the Bible, look at an historical context \n(i.e. how many other religions there are that have similar or \ndifferent stories), and apply logic. For example, could the nation of \nIsrael, some hundreds of thousands strong, have wandered the desert \nfor 40 years and leave NO SIGN of it in today's archeological record? \nCould humans of the B.C. era build an ark actually big enough for all \nthe animals, their food, etc., and yet build it with one door and one \nwindow? \u0014\n\u0014\nThose who rate Templeton's book poorly seem to be craving some source \nof \"proof\" that shows the Bible is not true. They also seem to \noverlook the fact they have no proof that the Bible IS true. They \njust choose to believe in it. Templeton asks that the reader use \nhis/her mind to consider the events described in the Bible, and ask, \n\"Could this have happened? Or is the story more likely a story \ndesigned to foster a particular point of view?\"\u0014",

Each of them knew her \npersonally and\u0014\nsaw her from a different perspective, and the result was four \nremarkably\u0014\ndifferent pictures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis helps us understand why there are four Gospels in the New \nTestament.\u0014\nOne Gospel would give us the life of Jesus as seen from only one\u0014\nperspective, and that would mean a very inadequate portrait. Jesus is \ntoo\u0014\ncomplex to be seen from only one perspective. God inspired four men \nto write\u0014\nthe life of Jesus, for each of them gives us unique insight into \nJesus that\u0014\nyou do not get in the others.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark gives us the perspective that is most popular in our modern \nworld.\u0014\nWycliff Bible Translators have made Mark the most translated book in \nthe\u0014\nworld. There is no other book in the world in so many different \nlanguages.\u0014\nIt is the shortest of the Gospels, and, therefore, the fastest to \ntranslate\u0014\nand to read.\u0014\n\u0014\nGlenn Pease, Sermon: The Beginning of the Gospel\u0014",

Learn the \nlegends behind your favorite holiday plants.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks ago, a reader asked about the origin of the wreath. She \nhad heard that it was meant to be a symbol of Christ's crown of \nthorns. That connection is a stretch, but the wreath and other \nChristmastime foliage have symbolized many things over the centuries, \nsome of them Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wreath seems to represent a convergence of two lines of \ntradition. One one side, it's probably related to circlets worn on \nthe head. In cultures of the ancient Persian Empire, nobles wore \ndiadems of fabric and sometimes jewels, and Greeks rewarded Olympic \nvictors and other high achievers with laurel crowns. It's unclear how \nsuch headgear was transformed into wall decor, but perhaps people \njust hung their crowns up as souvenirs. Neither Christmas nor Advent \nwreaths are worn as headbands, though for the Swedish festival of St. \nLucia, on December 13, the family's eldest daughter wears a headpiece \ndecorated with greenery and nine lighted candles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough early Roman Christians used laurel in their Christmas \ndecorations because it symbolized victory, glory, and cleansing from \nguilt, Europeans largely favored evergreens. This shows the modern \nwreath's other heritage: German and Celtic solstice festivities. In \ncold, northern climates, people latched onto anything that \nrepresented light and life against darkness and despair. As a result, \ntheir favorite winter symbols included torches (analagous to Advent \ncandles) and plants that stayed green all year. A wreath with burning \ncandles, then, is related to the Yule loga good-luck charm held over \nfrom the 12-day Norse winter festival of Jol. Christmas candles may \nalso be related to Hanukkah candles, as both of the nearly concurrent \nobservances celebrate holy light.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough wreaths have no direct connection to Christ's crown, holly \ndoes. European Christians in the Middle Ages said that its prickly \nleaves and red berries represented thorns and drops of blood. Some \nalso believed that the cross was made of holly, though others \nbelieved it was made of oak. Holly used in Christmas decorations was \noften kept after the holiday for protectionagainst witchcraft in \nEngland and against lightning in Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nDecorative mistletoe, too, usually lasted beyond the Christmas \nseason, until Candlemas (February 2) or even until the next year, \nwhen a new sprig took its place. The kissing tradition stems from an \nold Scandanavian custom whereby enemies who met under mistletoe in \nthe forest would lay down their weapons and maintain a truce until \nthe next day. Mistletoe is usually excluded from church decorations, \nfor the obvious reason, but also because the plant was worshiped by \nDruids, who believed it could cure all diseases.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the only Christmas plant without pagan superstitions attached \nto is the poinsettia. Dr. Joel Roberts Poinsett, the American \nambassador to Mexico, brought the flower to this country in 1829. \nMexicans call it the \"flower of Holy Night\" because its red bracts \n(they're not petals) make a shape like the Star of Bethlehem. \nAccording to a Mexican legend, long ago a poor boy was afraid to \nenter the church on Christmas Eve because he had no gift to bring the \nbaby Jesus. In prayer, the boy told God that he really wanted to \nbring a gift but could not afford one. When the boy opened his eyes, \na poinsettia bloomed at his feet. He joyfully brought the plant \ninside, an act that might relate to the practice in many churches of \ndecking the altar with poinsettias.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe CH newsletter will be taking next week off, so Merry Christmas, \nHappy New Year, and we'll see you in the real new millennium.\u0014\n\u0014\n* Information for this article was found in Holiday Symbols, edited \nby Sue Ellen Thompson (Omnigraphics, 1998), and at \nwww.neiu.edu/~history/wei3.htm.\u0014",

    "words": "Food for the Soul? \u0014\n\u0014\nThough Lent is supposed to be about the heart, not the stomach, the \nseason is famous for provoking culinary creativity.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nThough very few Catholics attended my rural Indiana high school, \nstudents took special notice of them every spring when the Friday hot \nlunch menu shifted from pizza, corn, pears, and a cookie to fish \nsandwich, tater tots, pears, and a cookie. People grumbled, because \npizza (even icky cafeteria pizza) beat fish sandwich hands down. But \ncompared to lenten fasters of the past, we got off easy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLent, the period of fasting in preparation for Easter, has been on \nthe church calendar since the first or second century. It has not, \nhowever, always occupied the same dates. According to Irenaeus (c. \n130-c. 200), cited by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History, the \nlenten fast originally lasted only two or three days. The 40-day \nperiod, first mentioned in the Canons of Nicea (325), was probably \nadopted to parallel the 40-day fasts of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, \nthough it may also have reflected the 40 hours Jesus spent in the \ntomb. These days were spread out in various ways by different \nchurches before settling, in the West, into the familiar Ash \nWednesday-to-Holy Saturday (minus Sundays) pattern in the seventh \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all early Christians fasted in the same way. The Greek historian \nSocrates (380-450) records, \"Some abstain from every sort of creature \nthat has life, while others of all the living creatures eat of fish \nonly. Others eat birds as well as fish, because, according to the \nMosaic account of the Creation, they too sprang from the water; \nothers abstain from fruit covered by a hard shell and from eggs. Some \neat dry bread only, others not even that; others again when they have \nfasted to the ninth hour (three o'clock) partake of various kinds of \nfood.\" The fast grew stricter as Easter approached; the typical Holy \nWeek diet consisted of dry food, bread, salt, and vegetables.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, almost as soon as dietary restrictions were put in place, \npeople started looking for ways to evade them. Many medieval churches \nallowed parishioners to eat eggs and milk products during Lent in \nexchange for pious acts or charitable contributions. These \ncontributions proved so profitable for France's Rouen cathedral that \none of the steeples was known as the Butter Tower. The practice of \ngiving Easter eggs hearkens back to this ovo-lacto prohibition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fish exception occasioned boundless creativity in the Middle \nAges. Seafood arrived at the table in numerous dishes, including \nbouillabaisse, which was invented by a French abbess. But eating the \nsame type of fish all the time got old, so monasteries and royal \nhouses kept enormous aquariums to keep the supply abundant and \nvarious. Also, for Lent only, birds were considered fish, especially \nif they could be prepared with almond \"scales\" or other tricks to \nmake them look like fish. A legend sprang up about the barnacle goose \nthat it was, in fact, an adult barnacle and therefore an edible sea \ncreature. Otters and turtles got to be fish for 40 days, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nTasty as all of this could be, I would not have trusted the cooks at \nmy high school with preparing bouillabaise or barnacle goose. They \nmight have done better with another Lenten innovation: the pretzel. \nChristians in the Roman Empire made this simple bread treat out of \nflour, salt, and waterno eggs, milk, or other forbidden ingredients \nrequired. Then they folded it in the shape of two arms crossed in \nprayer. They called the bread \"bracellae,\" or \"little arms.\" Later, \nGerman Christians called it \"brezel\" or \"prezel,\" which is where we \ngot our word for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nA short-term diet of seafood, vegetables, and pretzels doesn't sound \nhalf bad, but of course this isn't the point. The Bible, which gives \nno lenten menu suggestions, does offer this: \"Therefore, prepare your \nminds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the \ngrace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed\" (1 Peter 1:13). \nThat's a goal we all can strive for, no matter what we're having for \nlunch.\u0014\n\u0014\n* Information for this article was collected from these sites:\u0014\nwww.intermirifica.org/lent/food.htm\u0014\nwww.medievalfreeco.swinternet.co.uk/fact.htm (Google cache)\u0014\nwww.canticanova.com/article/easter/art532.htm\u0014",

    "title": "FESTIVAL OF FEARS",
    "words": "Festival of Fears \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat's scarier than Halloween? The anxieties that drive it.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nLike so many cultural events, Halloween will be different this year. \nAccording to the October 22 Chicago Tribune, fears about anthraxon \ntop of fears about razor blades, poison, and sugar highsmay cause \nmore parents to keep their children home this Halloween. In Hobart, \nIndiana, parents won't have a choice; the city has canceled \ntrick-or-treating. Though I'm sure I'll still see a few ghosts and \ngoblins on my doorstep next week, the country seems to have a reduced \nappetite for risk.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever changes mark this year's Halloween, though, we shouldn't \nexpect them to stick. As Ellen Feldman notes in the current issue of \nAmerican Heritage magazine, \"Halloween is a plastic holiday  mauled \nand molded to fit the needs of each generation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHalloween has its roots in Samhain, an ancient Celtic festival. \nDespite claims by modern Wiccans and Druids to have recreated lost \nrites, no one really knows what happened during Samhain. It's likely \nthat Celts repelled the foreboding caused by lengthening nights, \nfalling temperatures, and withering plants, plus serious belief in \nsupernatural evil, with bonfires, human and/or vegetable sacrifices, \nand scary costumes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe grisly aspects of Celtic fall festivities were tempered somewhat \nby the arrival of the Romans, whose harvest-time celebrations of the \ngoddess Pomona emphasized fertility and love. The Catholic church, \nhowever, was hardly impressed with this \"improvement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTaking the \"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" position that had worked \nreasonably well with formerly pagan Easter and Christmas, \neighth-century Pope Gregory III decided to baptize Samhain, retaining \nsome customs but radically redefining their focus. Gregory moved All \nSaints', or Hallows', Day from May 13 to November 1 (which made \nOctober 31 All Hallows' Eve, i.e. Hallowe'en) and instructed revelers \nto dress as saints instead of evil spirits. Goodies that once had \nbeen offered to propitiate wandering devils were instead offered to \npoor people, who in turn vowed to pray for the souls of departed \nrelatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants, wary of both saints and praying for the dead, have never \nbeen too sanguine about Halloween. Martin Luther may have chosen to \npost his 95 Theses on October 31 specifically to protest the holiday. \nNew England Puritans banned the celebration altogether, along with \nEaster and Christmas. Though the Catholic Maryland and Anglican \nVirginia colonies retained some Halloween customs, most of the \nholiday's traditional Celtic elements (including nighttime pranks and \nasking for food handouts) didn't come to this side of the Atlantic \nuntil massive Irish immigration in the nineteenth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nMainstream Halloween celebrations in the Victorian era were generally \ntame and devoid of occult overtones. Instead of pulling pranks or \nhaunting neighborhoods, young people chatted and flirted in festooned \nparlors. By the beginning of the twentieth century, some towns had \ngone so far as to make Halloween primarily a civic affair, complete \nwith parades and block parties. When trick-or-treating became widely \npopular, in the 1950s, most participants knew of neither the Celtic \nnor the Catholic rationales behind the practice.\u0014\n\u0014\nHalloween's multiple identities may stem from its role as a screen \nfor projected anxieties. Samhain gave ancient agrarians a way to \naddress fears about death and darkness, while medieval Halloween \nplayed on fears about the state of loved ones' souls. Candy handouts \nin twentieth-century America grew out of genuine concern to avert \nharmful high-jinks.\u0014\n\u0014\nCostume choices provide a particularly interesting peek at cultural \nconcerns. Sue Ellen Thompson's 1998 book Holiday Symbols points out \nthat during the Great Depression, \"children often disguised \nthemselves as hobos, burglars, pirates, and Indiansin other words, \nas economic and social outcasts, symbolic of the troubles from which \ntheir parents were struggling to escape.\" Time magazine's pick for \nthe scariest costume of 1973 was a Nixon mask. In the 1980s, kids \noften emulated characters from TV, movies, and even ads in an attempt \nto be \"cool\" by consumer standards. This year's popular costumes \ncover fresh wounds, as children and adults opt for representations of \norder (firemen, policemen, and soldiers) and patriotism (Uncle Sam, \nthe Statue of Liberty, Abraham Lincoln).\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not going to get into the debate about whether Christians should \ngo with the Halloween flow or propose wholesome alternatives. If the \nreal issue is fear, costumes and candy ultimately have little to do \nwith the problem or the solution.\u0014\n\u0014\n* The American Heritage Halloween article is online here.\u0014\n* The Urban Legends Reference Pages are always a good source for \ninvestigating holiday myths.\u0014\nElesha Coffman is managing editor of Christian History, and can be \nreached at cheditor@christiantytoday.\u0014",

    "title": "FROM ORATORIOS TO ELVIS",
    "words": "Christian History Corner: From Oratorios to Elvis\u0014\nPop culture has been coming to a church near you for hundreds of \nyears.\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong | posted 01/10/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nLadies and gentlemen, Elvis has entered the (church) building.\u0014\n\u0014\nImagine a mutton-chop-whiskered, white-jump-suited Anglican priest, \nposed dramatically on one knee, arm raised skyward, belting out, \nbefore a cheering crowd of the pious and the curious, the Elvis hit \n\"Where Could I Go But to the Lord.\" (Yes, Elvis covered that song in \n1968. His Majesty is not in the Gospel Hall of Fame for nothinghe \ngarnered all three of his Grammies for gospel hits, not rock tunes.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe priest then regales his riveted audience with Christian rewrites \nof such secular Elvis perennials as \"Blue Suede Shoes\" (\"Well it's \none for the Father, two for the Son, three for the Holy Spirit and \nyour life has just begun.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the Rev. Dorian Baxter\"Elvis Priestly,\" he likes to be \ncalled. Last Sunday, January 5, Baxter held the inaugural service of \nhis \"Christ the King, Grace-Land, Independent Anglican Church\" in a \nNewmarket, Ontario Legion Hall. Two hundred potential members showed \nup, along with a bevy of paparazzi.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaxter uses the hyphen in \"Grace-Land\" to emphasize \"Grace.\" (He also \nrecognizes that the King lived a less than saintly life, but he \ninsists the rock'n'roll star held firmly throughout his life to faith \nin Jesus and died with a pure heart.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe uses the \"Independent\" because Canadian Anglican officials have \nfound his shtick \"in poor taste,\" and demoted him to \n\"priest-on-leave\" from the Diocese of Algoma in Sault Ste. Marie, \nOntario. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of reaction is a familiar one for those through the \ncenturies who have drawn on secular cultural forms in their efforts \nto bring sinners from the world into the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn their defense, such churchly pop-culture innovators have pointed \nout that Jesus always showed up where the people were and ate and \ndrank with them. As a result, the Savior, too, suffered harsh \ncritiques (\"winebibber and a glutton\") from the religious folk. The \ninnovators have also looked to the consummate evangelist, Paul, as a \nmodel. After all, he preached to the Greeks, quoting their own pagan \npoets, and avowed he would become \"all things to all men\" in order to \nwin even a few.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there's the oft-told tale of how Martin Luther used tavern \nsongs' melodies for some of his hymns, defiantly defending his \nactions by saying, \"Why should the devil have all the good tunes?\" \nAlternate versions of this story have Charles Wesley trolling the \npublic houses for usable melodies and offering up the same question \nin his defense.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, though it is possible Luther and Wesley both borrowed tunes \nfrom the popular songs of their days, both Methodist and Lutheran \nscholars have insisted these stories are legendary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is more certain is that the English evangelist Rowland Hill \n(1744-1833) did indeed ask why the devil should get all the good \ntunes, and did use popular music in his meetings.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn both the use of that phrase and the practice of adapting pop music \nto evangelistic settings, Hill was followed even more famously by the \nnineteenth-century founders of the Salvation Armythe Booth family.\u0014\n\u0014\nIan Bradley, author of Abide with Me: The World of Victorian Hymns (a \nwonderful source on these matters and, believe it or not, a ripping \ngood read), tells the story. When the patriarch William Booth was \ntold that certain kinds of music were too much \"of the world\" to be \nused in evangelistic meetings, he retorted crustily, \"Not allowed to \nsing that tune or this tune? Indeed! Secular music, do you say? \nBelongs to the devil, does it? Well, if it did, I would plunder him \nof it.Every note and every strain and every harmony is divine and \nbelongs to us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother story places Booth at a revival meeting in a Worcester \ntheater, enjoying a popular Christian chorus titled \"Bless His Name, \nHe Sets Me Free.\" Booth was surprised to discover that the song's \ntune came from a music-hall ditty, \"Champagne Charlie is My Name.\" \nTurning to a family member, he delivered Hill's famous line, \"That \nsettles it. Why should the devil have all the best tunes?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Army proceeded to adapt for their own use such popular music as \nStephen Foster's minstrel songs, music hall favorites, andyeseven \ndrinking songs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn doing so, Booth and his followers were tapping a tradition that \ndated back at least to the sixteenth-century origins and \nseventeenth-century elaboration of the sacred \"oratorio\" form. This \nform borrowed much from secular opera and chamber pieces in order to \nattract people to church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the roots of the practice, Booth could soon testify that \nsongs adapted from the streets often triggered \"overpowering scenes \nof salvation,\" both in England and in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nHmm. OK, so there are historical precedents for Baxter's Elvis song \nrewrites. But surely the dramatic elementsthe costumes, the \nposesare something new.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the rousing Salvation Army meetings of the nineteenth \ncentury featured not just upbeat popular music but innovative uses of \n\"illustrated sermons\" and dramas. This tradition, too, had venerable \nroots, dating (despite the church's often violent objection to \nsecular theater) back to medieval \"mystery plays.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNor did this highly effective practice die with the Army. To give \njust one example, when near the turn of the twentieth century a young \ngirl attended Salvation Army meetings in Canada with family members, \na new era of evangelistic pop-culture absorption was launched. This \nwas Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the Church of the Foursquare \nGospel in Los Angeles, California.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the founding of her Angelus Temple a block from Sunset Boulevard \nin that city, on January 1, 1923, McPherson wowed her Hollywood-savvy \naudiences with the lavish dramatic productions she offered under its \nvaulted dome. These included everything from punchy vignettes \n(\"Sister\" once brought a motorcycle on stage with her to make a \npoint) to glittering extravaganzas presented on a stage festooned \nwith flowers and illuminated with batteries of lights (Read Edith L. \nBlumhofer's Aimee Semple McPherson: Everybody's Sister).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it has gone, in every imaginable area of artistic expression. \nThe church has eagerly borrowed from the most popular forms offered \nby the world. Next week, we will look at some of the results of that \nborrowing and ask, How have Christians reacted? And, from purely \naesthetic and pragmatic points of view, how successful have such \nChristian forays into popular forms been?\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "words": "Faith vs. Statistics\u0014\nBeware of doing ethics by crunching numbers.\u0014\nby Charles Colson | posted 01/28/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a senate hearing room, Christopher Reeve is testifying in support \nof embryonic stem-cell research. Sitting in his wheelchair, breathing \nwith a ventilator, the former star of Superman films makes a \nsympathetic figure. And then someone raises an uncomfortable \nquestion: Is it ethical to take a life to save a life? Embryonic \nstem-cell research does, after all, destroy human embryos.\u0014\n\u0014\nReeve counters: \"I thought it was the job of the government to do the \ngreatest good for the greatest number.\" Senators and reporters nod in \nagreement.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, they didn't get it. If the government really embraced \"the \ngreatest good for the greatest number,\" Reeve himself might be dead. \nAfter all, Reeve's therapies, his doctors, his aides, and his \nmotorized wheelchair cost millionsmoney that could, instead, fund \nbasic medical care for hundreds of poor children.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Reeve can afford to pay for all of this himselfa \nfortunate fact should the government take his \"greatest good\" advice. \nBut he's still asking taxpayers to spend millions on research to \ntreat spinal cord injuries. Given that vastly more Americans need \nimmunizations than a cure for paralysis, wouldn't a \"greatest good\" \npolicy mean spending scarce research funds on immunizations instead \nof paralysis research?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've used this vignette in speeches, and to my shock, I've found that \neven Christians nod in agreement with Reeve's reasoninguntil I \nexplain just where this thinking leads. Have we all unthinkingly \nbecome practical utilitarians?\u0014\n\u0014\nReeve is echoing the arguments of Princeton philosopher Peter Singer, \nthe quintessential moral utilitarian. Singer believes morality cannot \nbe judged by any transcendent standard. Instead, he suggests we ask \nwhether a particular action will increase the world's sum total of \nhappiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Singer believes parents should, instead of spending \nmoney on lifesaving surgery for their child, send the money to save a \nhundred African children from starvation; doing so would increase the \nworld's total amount of happiness. Singer scorns traditional \nteachings about the sanctity of human life, believing that some \npeopleencephalitic babies, for exampleare not actually \"persons.\" \nHe argues that parents should be allowed to kill their handicapped \nnewborns (a healthy replacement baby would live a happier life), and \nfavors euthanasia for sick and elderly people who have lost the basic \ncapacity for mental functioning and who create a burden on others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the \"greatest good\" philosophy that Christopher Reeve \nespouses. I wonder if he knows that Singer, on his first day at \nPrinceton, was greeted by protesters from Not Dead Yet, a group of \npeople wholike Reeveare wheelchair-bound. Unlike Reeve, they \nunderstand exactly where Singer's teaching leads: euthanasia for \nthose considered burdens on society.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis philosophy also leads to absurdity. Rejecting the uniqueness of \nhuman life, Singer claims that drawing distinctions between humans \nand animals is \"speciesism.\" Soquite logicallyhe professes to find \nnothing morally objectionable about bestiality (sex with animals), a \nview that shocks even non-Christians. (When my colleague Nigel \nCameron pressed him in a recent debate on the question of the \nanimal's consent, it put Singer on the defensive.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn utilitarianism, we encounter a philosophy dramatically at odds \nwith Christianity. The Scriptures teach that God created humans in \nhis own image, giving each a unique moral character. Christianity, as \nMother Teresa used to say, is anti-statistical. Every human, at every \nstage in life, has intrinsic, not merely instrumental, worth. This \nmeans it's never right to create and then kill one person to find a \ncure for another. Of course, we all want to see loved ones relieved \nof their suffering. But it shows what we're up against when even many \nChristians fail to grasp the implications of practical utilitarianism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one sense, we can be grateful for Peter Singer. He does what \nFrancis Schaeffer urged us to make secularists dothat is, take their \nreasonable-sounding philosophies and carry them to their logical and \noften preposterous conclusions. I've discovered that this tactic is \nthe best way to penetrate the postmodern fog. If biblical revelation \nis true, any proposition that is inconsistent with it can be shown to \nbe irrational.\u0014\n\u0014\nLife-and-death issues like stem-cell research won't go away. If we \ndon't make the case against utilitarianism, policies that today make \nmost of us recoil may one day, as our moral sensibilities become \nanesthetized, elicit nothing more than a shrug. And then, as the \nphilosophy of \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" takes hold, \nthe Christopher Reeves of the world will be in periland so will the \nrest of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "French Scientist \nBlaise Pascal Finds God\u0014\n\u0014\nSay you are a world-renowned scientist, credited with some of the \ngreatest discoveries of all\u0014\ntime. What more could you possibly want?\u0014\n\u0014\nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662), the French genius who in his brief \nlifetime made numerous\u0014\nworld-changing discoveries, knew there was much, much more.\u0014\n\u0014\nPascal grew up in Paris, schooled at home by his father. He showed \nearly promise: at age\u0014\neight he wrote his first scientific paper; at 16 he wrote a \nmathematical essay that broke new\u0014\nground in the field of geometry. \u0014\n\u0014\nWait, dlere's more!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was 19, Pascal invented a calculating machine, a forerunner \nof modem computers. At 23, he made major discoveries in physics and \nproved the existence of the vacuum. This paved the way for hypodermic \nsyringes, barometers, and hydraulic devices. Pascal also came up with \nthe mathematical theory of probability and helped shape the field of \ncalculus.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his teens, he often suffered great pain in his legs; as an adult \nhe became partially crippled. One night, unable to sleep due to the \npain, he arose and wrote down the solution to a prob- lem that \nadvanced a very difficult area of mathematics.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, though Pascal knew very well the power of the mind and the \npotential of human reason, he also knew that people cannot solve the \ndeep- est mysteries and needs of life with their minds alone. He \nunderstood that mankind is at the same time very great and very \nflawed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough various personal trials, Pascal became more and more a \nreligious man. He was much aIIected when his niece was miraculously \nhealed of a tumor. After he was nearly killed in a carriage accident, \nhe was converted to a deep relationship with Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeace with God\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day on which he found peace with God was so important to him that \nhe wrote a reminder of it on parchment and sewed it into the lining \nof his coat. He kept this coat for the rest of his life, and the note \nwas found there when he died at age 39.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn it he told how he had come to know \"the God of Abraham, God of \nIsaac, God of Jacob.\"\u0014\nHe ended by writing, \"I will not forget thy word.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1662, from the room where he lay painfully dying, Pascal observed \nthe plight of the poor in the streets, having to trudge long \ndistances while the rich comfortably rode. One of his last great \nideas was the bus--public transportation.\u0014",

    "words": "Saturday, Apr. 26, 2003 TIME\u0014\n\u0014\nForever a Prisoner\u0014\n'Once you become an enemy of Uday, you are nothing.'\u0014\n\u0014\nBy APARISIM GHOSH I BAGHDAD\u0014\n\u0014\nThe walls of Lahib Nouman's home don't just talk, they howl. They \nscream in\u0014\nterror, shout with rage, moan in pain and sob with frustration. All \nthe emotions\u0014\noverloading this tiny woman's brutalized mind she projects onto the \nwalls of\u0014\nher living room. She scrawls on them with maroon lipstick, ocher \nspray paint\u0014\nand gray lumps of charcoal, in Arabic and a sprinkling of French. \nIt's the only\u0014\nway she knows to exorcise her mental demons, to preserve what remains \nof\u0014\nher sanity. \"There's so much inside here,\" she says, slapping \nviolently\u0014\nagainst the side of her head. \"I have to take some of it out and put \nit down\u0014\nsomewhere, or I will burst.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe effort seems to have taken over Nouman's life to the exclusion of\u0014\neverything else. Her small home in Baghdad's working-class al-Ghadeer\u0014\ndistrict is filthy; the rooms are damp and smell of rotting garbage. \nHer pets, a\u0014\nmangy brown pup and two molting cats, have shed clumps of fur on her \nbed,\u0014\nan old foam mattress on the living-room floor. There are pieces of \nstale\u0014\nbread everywhere. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the squalor doesn't seem to bother Nouman. She has lived in much\u0014\nworse placesa succession of prison cells, torture chambers and\u0014\nmental-hospital wards. Her living room may be fetid, but it is home, \nand she's\u0014\nfree. \"Nobody bothers me here. Nobody does bad things to me,\" she \nsays. \"I\u0014\ncan say and do and write whatever I want.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEven by Iraqi standards, Nouman, 48, has enjoyed little freedom, at \nleast not\u0014\nsince 1985, when she ran afoul of Uday, Saddam Hussein's barbaric \neldest\u0014\nson. A criminal lawyer, Nouman had the temerity to defend a man Uday\u0014\nwanted punished for insulting his girlfriend, and Nouman paid for it \nwith nearly\u0014\ntwo decades' worth of torment. In prison, she endured rape, beatings \nand\u0014\nunspeakable torture. In the hospital, she was subjected to countless \nsessions\u0014\nof shock therapy and powerful sedatives. Along the way, her mind \nbecame\u0014\nunhinged, her memories scrambled and her face frozen in a mask of\u0014\npermanent terror. \"They have turned me into a witch,\" she says, \nruefully\u0014\npulling at her stringy hair, which she has dyed the color of tea. \n\"They have\u0014\nmade me horrible.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nUntil three weeks ago, Nouman was incarcerated at al-Rashad, Baghdad's\u0014\nmain mental hospital. When U.S. forces began taking the city, the \nstaff ran\u0014\naway, enabling inmates to escape. Nouman made straight for her house \nin\u0014\nal-Ghadeer, and has been holed up there ever since, scrawling \nfuriously on\u0014\nthe walls. \"This is my work now,\" she says. \"This is what I have to \ndo.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAlready she's running out of space. She set out to write the story of \nher life,\u0014\nbut the narrative is lost in a maze of digressions. There are \nreligious\u0014\nmotifsa number of crooked crucifixes (she was raised a Chaldean \nCatholic)\u0014\nand exhortations to Mary and Allah. There are homages to her favorite \nmutt,\u0014\nSandi. There are political slogans calling for solidarity among Iraq, \nthe Arab\u0014\nnations and France, where she was educated. And then there are some\u0014\ndoggerel verses that don't always make sense but are apparently \ndesigned\u0014\nfor self-motivation: In the grave, there are no cowards. I will never \ngive up. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis isn't how Lahib Nouman's life was supposed to turn out. Her \nfather was a\u0014\nwealthy dealer in engineering tools. The Noumans lived in the then \ntony\u0014\ndistrict of Saadun and sent their 13 children to the city's best \nschools, where\u0014\nthey learned Arabic, French and English. Lahib's genteel upbringing \nis clear.\u0014\nShe uses demure terms even to describe the depraved treatment she has\u0014\nendured. Her torturers \"made pee-pee and ca-ca\" on her, she says in\u0014\nEnglish, and they \"made love\" to her against her will. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Noumans were Assyrians, an ethnic minority suppressed by\u0014\nSaddam's regime, they were careful to toe the official Baath Party \nline. Lahib\u0014\njoined the party in 1973 and become an enthusiastic apparatchik. She\u0014\nremembers participating in political debates at Baghdad University, \narguing\u0014\nforcefully for Baathist principles like secularism and socialism. She \nremained\u0014\nloyal even after her father blamed the collapse of his business on the\u0014\ngovernment, which took away his exclusive distribution deals with \nBritish and\u0014\nAmerican toolmakers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing a law degree, Nouman took a job as a criminal \ninvestigator\u0014\nat the Justice Ministry. Later she pursued a doctorate at the \nSorbonne. Her\u0014\nstudies were cut short in 1985, when she broke a hip in a traffic \naccident.\u0014\nBack in Baghdad, she began to take on criminal cases, mostly pro bono.\u0014\nThat's how she came upon Naadi, a young Egyptian bellhop who had\u0014\ncrossed Uday Hussein. Naadi was being held at a police station and \nbeing\u0014\ntortured even as Nouman waited to see him. \"They were touching his \nfingers\u0014\nwith a live wire, and I could hear his screams in the waiting area,\" \nshe recalls.\u0014\n\"When they finally let me see him, his first words were, 'Please help \nme to kill\u0014\nmyself.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNaadi's trouble began when he barred one of Uday's girlfriends from \nentering\u0014\nthe Babylon Hotel, where he worked, because she was drunk. Soon \nafter, he\u0014\nwas accused of stealing videotapes out of Uday's house. Nouman \npersuaded\u0014\nNaadi to let her represent him. The charges were so obviously false \nthat the\u0014\ncourt threw them out without much argument. But the clock had begun \nto run\u0014\ndown on Nouman's liberty. \"My friends told me I had cut my own neck,\" \nshe\u0014\nsays. \"But I thought Uday wouldn't dare to touch a lawyer, a respected\u0014\nmember of society.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHow wrong she was. Barely a month after the Naadi verdict, in a casual\u0014\nconversation with law colleagues, Nouman said the fateful words, \n\"There's no\u0014\njustice in this country.\" Someone informed the police, and within \nhours she\u0014\nwas arrested for contempt of court. Taken to al-Zafaraniya police \nstation, she\u0014\nwas, she says, brutally beaten for several days in a row, raped and \nhad a hot\u0014\ncandle forced into her rectum. \"I kept telling the police, 'You can't \ndo this to\u0014\nme. I'm a lawyer,'\" she says, smiling sadly at her own naivete. \"They \nsaid,\u0014\n'Once you become an enemy of Uday, you are nothing.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a week of near constant torture, Nouman recounts, she was taken \nto\u0014\nal-Rashad hospital on the outskirts of the city. There she had the \nfirst of\u0014\ncountless sessions of shock treatment. When she was released a month\u0014\nlater, Nouman recalls, she felt \"like a nightmare was over.\" It was \njust\u0014\nbeginning. She had been out only a few months when the police picked \nher\u0014\nup again, this time for allegedly saying (she denies it) \"I hate \nSaddam.\" She\u0014\nwas taken, she says, to the Khadamiya Prison for women, for a \nsix-month\u0014\nspell with long stretches in solitary confinement. She was tortured \nand beaten\u0014\nby other prisoners. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The wardens told the other women that since I was an enemy of Uday, \nthey\u0014\nhad permission to do whatever they wanted to me,\" Nouman says. \"The\u0014\nwomen wanted to please the wardens, so they were constantly slamming \nme\u0014\nagainst the walls.\" Again she was sent back to al-Rashad. \u0014\n\u0014\nNouman's life settled into a pattern. She would be arrested, thrown \ninto\u0014\nprison for a few months of torture, then forced to spend a month in \nthe\u0014\nmental hospital. She would be released for a few months, and then the \ncycle\u0014\nwould begin again. Looking back, she has difficulty remembering the\u0014\nchronology and duration of her incarcerations. \"There were too many,\" \nshe\u0014\nsays, \"and after all those years of taking drugs at the hospital of \nmadness,\u0014\nmy memory is mixed up.\" But if the repeated punishment was meant to\u0014\nsilence Nouman, it had the opposite effect. \"When I realized that \nthey could\u0014\narrest me whether or not I did anything wrong, I thought, Why not \nspeak my\u0014\nmind?\" She recounts how she tore up Saddam posters in the street, \nchanted\u0014\nanti-Uday slogans and, on one occasion, refused to take a 100-dinar \nnote in\u0014\nchange from a shopkeeper, declaring, \"I don't want another picture of\u0014\nSaddam Hussein.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHer most famous act of defiance came in 1988, after Uday personally\u0014\nmurdered Kamel Hanna Jajjo, Saddam's majordomo, for acting as a\u0014\ngo-between for Saddam and one of his mistresses. Word of the scandal\u0014\nspread through Baghdadeven to Nouman, in prison. At her next court\u0014\nhearing, she stood up and delivered an impromptu speech. Uday had \nkilled a\u0014\nman, she said, and he should be brought to trial and imprisoned. \"I \nsaid what\u0014\nevery Iraqi was thinking,\" she says. \"I just had nothing to lose. \nWhat could\u0014\nthey do to me that they were not already doing?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Baghdad's working-class districts, Nouman gained a certain amount \nof\u0014\nfame as the crazy woman lawyer who dared to stand up to Uday. Even \nsome\u0014\nof the staff at the mental hospital came to admire her tenacity. \"She \nnever\u0014\nstopped speaking against Uday, not even when she was getting shock\u0014\ntreatment,\" says Jabar Rubbaiyeh Lefteh, an ambulance driver at the \nmental\u0014\nhospital. \"She was braver than any man I know.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nlike all of iraq's prisons, the fudeiliya facility on the \nnortheastern edge of\u0014\nBaghdad now stands empty and wide open. After the Americans entered\u0014\nBaghdad, looters quickly stripped it of furniture and electrical \nfittings.\u0014\nReturning, along with a journalist and photographer, to the prison \nwhere she\u0014\nspent most of 1991, Nouman quickly draws a crowd of curious onlookers \nfrom\u0014\nthe neighboring houses. She confronts them angrily: \"When I was \ntortured\u0014\nhere and screamed for help, did you not hear me?\" The crowd remains \nmute.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe turns away scornfully and strides to the women's wing of the \nprison,\u0014\nwhere a number of large cells open onto a courtyard. A net of barbed \nwire\u0014\nhangs over the yard. The cells, now empty, are deceptively light and \nairy.\u0014\n\"When they were full, I could only sit like this,\" says Nouman, \ncrouching\u0014\nagainst a wall and pulling her knees against her chest. Set off from \nthe main\u0014\ncourtyard is a row of isolation cells. She spent several weeks in \none, and\u0014\nhesitates before entering it now. It is relatively big for an \nisolation cell, 15 ft.\u0014\nby 10 ft., with one small barred window close to the ceiling and no \ntoilet. (\"I\u0014\nhad to make pee-pee and ca-ca in the same room,\" she says.) \u0014\n\u0014\nNouman points to an officer's room, now deserted, where she says she \nwas\u0014\ntortured, \"every day, sharp at 10 a.m.\" The officer, she relates, \nmade her sit\u0014\non an empty \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein bottle \nuntil it had penetrated her rectally and filled up with\u0014\nblood. The officer also \"made love\" to her, she says, shuddering at \nthe\u0014\nrecollection. He was a big bear of a man and smelled of cooked meat. \n\"I\u0014\nthanked God when they took me from here to the hospital of madness,\" \nshe\u0014\nsays. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile her parents were alive, Nouman, who never married, had family to\u0014\nreturn to whenever she was released from the hospital. But after her \nfather\u0014\ndied in 1988 and her mother passed away in 1991, her siblings refused \nto\u0014\nhave anything to do with her. Over the years, most of them emigrated,\u0014\nwithout leaving forwarding addresses. Only three of her sisters \nremain in\u0014\nBaghdad, and she says they won't allow her into their homes. \"What her\u0014\nbrothers and sisters did was worse than what Uday did to her,\" says \nMushtaq\u0014\nZanbaqa, parish priest of the Chaldean Catholic church Nouman \nfrequents.\u0014\n\"Maybe they were afraid that Uday would punish them, but to turn your \nback\u0014\non your own sister is a terrible, terrible thing.\" The three sisters \ndeclined to\u0014\ntalk to TIME. Neighbors said none of the three ever married because\u0014\nNouman's reputation frightened away potential suitors. Unless the \nsisters\u0014\nhave a change of heart, Nouman may wind up in the mental hospital \nagain.\u0014\nWith the Saddam regime gone, she would probably be treated more \ngently,\u0014\nbut the thought of returning fills her with dread. Although she was \nhappy to\u0014\nwalk a journalist through the prisons she has lived in, she refused \nto visit\u0014\nal-Rashad. \"That is Satan's place,\" she says. Besides, she says, she \ncan't go\u0014\nanywhere until she has written the story of her life on her walls. \"I \nhave to\u0014\nfinish this, to get everything out of my head,\" she says. \"Then I \nwill be at\u0014\npeace.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe has one other ambition. In all the years she suffered his \nvengeance,\u0014\nNouman never met Uday. Before the war, she says, she didn't want to. \nNow\u0014\nshe would love to confront her tormentor. \"I want to see him, and I \nwant him to\u0014\nsee me,\" she says, thumping her chest. \"I want to tell him, 'Look, I \nam still\u0014\nhere, still saying what I want to say. You tried to stop me and \ncouldn't. What\u0014\ncan you do now?'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Time Inc. All rights reserved.\u0014",

    "title": "FRANKEL LIKES HIS HORSE -- EMPIRE MAKER",
    "words": "May 3, 2003\u0014\nDespite the (Favorable) Odds, Frankel Likes His Horse\u0014\nBy JOE DRAPE\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nLOUISVILLE, Ky., May 2  Long before he ever put a saddle on a horse, \nBobby Frankel wagered on them and, on the eve of the 129th running of \nthe Kentucky Derby, he sounded more like the Brooklyn boy in the \ngrandstands of Aqueduct who he once was than the Hall of Fame trainer \nhe is now. Beneath horse racing's most hallowed totems, the twin \nspires of Churchill Downs, Frankel declared his colt fit and issued a \nchallenge to anyone who believes his colt is not the deserving \nfavorite to capture America's most famous race.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bet against him at your own risk,\" he said. \"He's going to run a big \nrace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut neither numbers nor omens favor the chances of Empire Maker, the \ncolt the 61-year-old Frankel trains. Only 49 post-time favorites have \nwon the Derby, and only once in the last 23 years  Fusaichi Pegasus \nin 2000  has the horse sent off as the public's choice captured the \nblanket of roses.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the last colt to be so heavily favored in the Derby was \nArazi, the French horse who in 1992 was 6-5 in the morning-line odds, \njust like Empire Maker. Arazi's odds dipped even lower but he ended \nup a well-beaten eighth. Arazi had been a brilliant 2-year-old, \nwinning seven races, including the Breeders Cup' Juvenile, but turned \nout to be just an ordinary 3-year-old after being slowed by knee \nailments.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd 50 years ago, almost to the day, the Derby demonstrated how even \nan extraordinary horse could be denied by the race's \nmile-and-a-quarter distance. On May 2, 1953, Native Dancer, \nundefeated in 11 previous outings and already a celebrity because his \nraces were staples in the early days of television, went off as a 3-5 \nfavorite in the Derby only to finish a head behind a 24-1 shot named \nDark Star. It was the gray colt's only defeat in a 22-race career, \nwhich included victories in the two other legs of the Triple Crown, \nthe Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut despite the longstanding casualty list, Frankel remains unfazed. \nHe believes that what has made Empire Maker a formidable favorite \nwill not only lead to victory in the Kentucky Derby but also propel \nthe horse toward the first Triple Crown since Affirmed's in 1978.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe the script is already written,\" he said. \"I think he's \nmeant to win. They just don't want me to have an easy time of it here \nthis week.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the reasons Empire Maker arrives as the favorite is because he \nis the best-bred horse in the race. He is the son of Unbridled, a \nstrapping and long-striding horse who captured the 1990 Derby. His \nmother, Toussaud, was also an accomplished runner but is now more \nfamous for foaling five stakes winners in just six attempts.\u0014\n\u0014\nJuddmonte Farms, a Kentucky-based breeding and racing operation owned \nby Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, owns Toussaud and had the \nKentucky Derby in mind when it mated her with Unbridled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We obviously thought a great deal of her,\" said John Chandler, the \npresident of Juddmonte. \"We wanted to breed a little bit of size, \nwith the obvious stamina qualities  to be able to have a horse that \nwould run on the dirt and go around two turns.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foal that dropped in April 2000 on Juddmonte's 2,500 acres of \nbluegrass near Lexington, Ky., has, indeed, proved an adept two-turn \ndirt runner: Empire Maker has captured three of his five career races \nin devastating fashion, including the Florida Derby and the Wood \nMemorial, two traditional steppingstones to the Kentucky Derby.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the colt has also benefited from a bit of luck, or more precisely \nthe bad luck visited on some of his potential 3-year-old rivals. Last \nyear's Juvenile champion, Vindication, was injured in February and \nwas taken off the Triple Crown trail; so were Sky Mesa, another \nundefeated colt, and a pair of Grade I stakes winners named Toccet \nand Badge of Silver. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He is the last of the supertalented horses standing,\" said Bob \nBaffert, the three-time Derby-winning trainer who trains Vindication \nand will saddle the 12-1 shot Indian Express on Saturday. \"You know, \nI can never say it enough. You have to have an incredible amount of \nluck to just get a runner to the gate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Frankel, Empire Maker has a trainer who has won the Eclipse Award \nthe last three years as the nation's outstanding trainer and has won \nnearly every major stakes race in America, but not the Derby, for \nwhich he has saddled only five starters, including Empire Maker. His \nreputation for patience and for the excellent care of his horses \nmakes the hullabaloo over a bruise on Empire Maker's right front foot \nseem hollow, his rivals say.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If something wasn't right about his horse, he would not run him,\" \nthe four-time Derby winner D. Wayne Lukas said. \"Bobby is too good of \na trainer, and out there somewhere is a Derby with his name on it and \nhe thinks it's this one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBaffert and Lukas have failed to win the race with horses that went \nto the starting gate as favorites, and each points out that a \nmultitude of things can go wrong once the gates open, especially in \nthe large field of 16. Native Dancer, for example, was bumped on the \nfirst turn in the 1953 Derby and was raced wide down the backstretch \nby jockey Eric Guerin in a ride many believe was poorly handled. In \n2001, Baffert's Point Given was the 9-5 favorite and ran near the \nfront of a blistering pace before giving way to finish fifth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We ran him too close to the front and the track was hard and fast \nthat day and he couldn't handle it,\" a still tormented Baffert said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo insure that Empire Maker is properly handled, Frankel has employed \nJerry Bailey, who has captured the past three Eclipse Awards as the \nnation's outstanding jockey. Bailey has been aboard for all five of \nthe colt's starts and has administered lessons to Empire Maker to \nspeed his maturation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpire Maker's mother, Toussaud, not only produces very fast runners \nbut also passes on some eccentricities that made her a tough horse to \nhandle during her racing career. She, too, was trained by Frankel. In \nthe mornings Toussaud sometimes refused to run, and in other \ninstances she insisted on running the wrong way on the track. In the \nWood Memorial, Bailey had to stir Empire Maker in the stretch after \nhe passed Funny Cide and then appeared to lose momentum as he looked \ninto the stands.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do know the history of the family, and a lot of it was, don't make \nthe lead too soon, the concentration fails once they make the lead,\" \nBailey said. \"But actually in the Florida Derby, knowing that, I made \nthe lead a little early on purpose just to see what he would do, and \nhe was professional about the whole thing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpire Maker displayed some of his family traits on a conditioning \ngallop this morning  his first since Tuesday  when he decided to \nhang a hard right on the track and moved all the way to the outside \nrail. His exercise rider, Jose Cuevas, wrangled him back in control. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrankel dismissed the incident and said Empire Maker pulled a similar \nantic the day before the Florida Derby. \"But in Florida,\" Frankel \nsaid, \"nobody was around to see it or make a big deal of it. Here we \nhave all this Kentucky Derby stuff going on and it becomes part of \nthe drama. It is documented; everything out of that mare pulls \nstunts. She pulled stunts, and so do all her kids.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe drama, however, is drawing to a close, and Frankel says he will \nbuck the numbers, ignore the omens and offer no excuses if Empire \nMaker comes up short. In about two minutes over a mile and a quarter \non Saturday, the Hall of Fame trainer will be proved either prescient \nor dead wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nEither way, Frankel and his colt will be in good company.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company | Home | Privacy Policy | \nSearch | Corrections | Help | Back to Top\u0014",

    "words": "128TH PREAKNESS STAKES: 'Funny' gets serious \u0014\nGelding romps, eyes first Triple Crown since 1978\u0014\n\u0014\nBY JOHN MARKON\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER\u0014\nMay 18, 2003\u0014\n\u0014\nBALTIMORE - Two-thirds of the way through racing's Triple Crown, his \nrivals have seen only one side of Funny Cide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat would be his backside.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Kentucky Derby-winning gelding put the Preakness field in his \nrearview mirror yesterday, storming unchallenged down the stretch to \nwin by 9 lengths, the second-largest margin of victory in stakes \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only Preakness more one-sided was the first one, when a colt \nnamed Survivor was 10 lengths better than the best of his six rivals.\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide will be pointed toward the June 7 Belmont Stakes and the \npossibility of a Triple Crown sweep, unrealized since Affirmed in \n1978. While 11 colts have captured the Triple Crown, Funny Cide would \nbe the first gelding to do so. Yesterday, he became the first gelding \nto win the Derby and the Preakness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was little drama at the Derby, where Funny Cide won by 2 \nlengths over favorite Empire Maker, and even less at Pimlico. After \nbeing hustled toward the front from an outside post by jockey Jose \nSantos, Funny Cide stalked front-runners Cherokee's Boy and Peace \nRules down the backstretch.\u0014\nWhen Cherokee's Boy faded, it left Funny Cide head-to-head against \nPeace Rules, with the winner gaining the lead exiting the second turn \nand almost disappearing from view as three bedraggled rivals \nstruggled for the lesser places.\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide, the favorite, paid $3.80 to win. Second place went to \nlong shot Midway Road, fleshing out a $120.60 exacta. Scrimshaw was \nthird by a nose over Peace Rules.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe winning time of 1:55 3/5 was two full seconds off the Preakness \nrecord, but yesterday's somewhat water-logged racing surface, rated \n\"good,\" wasn't producing fast times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hats off to that winner,\" said jockey Richard Migliore, who was \nbeaten by 24 lengths on last-place Kissin Saint. \"That was some \nimpressive performance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My horse got a break on the field and had everything his way,\" said \nBobby Frankel, trainer of Peace Rules, \"and we still got beat. What \nelse can you say?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of what was said about Funny Cide before the race hadn't been \ngood. Santos spent three days listening to ultimately groundless \nallegations that he'd cheated to win the Derby. Even after Santos was \ncleared, trainer Barclay Tagg, a 62-year-old veteran with his first \nbig-time runner, was noticeably edgy in the spotlight.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"With all that everyone was laying on him,\" admitted Tagg, \"Funny \nCide was carrying a lot more than 126 pounds today.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Tagg and the 10-member syndicate that owns Funny Cide stayed in \ntown to celebrate and make a few bids at this afternoon's Timonium \nsale, Funny Cide was loaded into a van and shipped back to Belmont \nPark less than three hours after he'd crossed the finish line.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The mile-and-a-half at the Belmont shouldn't be a problem for him,\" \nTagg said. \"Right now, he's never been better. I'd say he was rising \nto the moment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide will be the ninth horse since 1978 to run for the Crown at \nBelmont Park. While Crowns remain rare, bids for the Crown have \nbecome increasingly common. In the past seven years, Silver Charm \n(1997), Real Quiet (1998), Charismatic (1999) and War Emblem (2002) \nhave been stopped short of the third jewel.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll but Charismatic were trained by Bob Baffert, who was fifth with \nSenor Swinger yesterday.\u0014\n\"I couldn't find my horse in the stretch, so I watched Funny Cide \ninstead,\" Baffert said. \"I'm getting off the trail at this bus stop \nand rooting for Funny Cide to win the Triple Crown.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Belmont, Funny Cide can anticipate another joust with, among \nothers, a rested Empire Maker and an equally fresh \nAtswhatimtalknbout, a fast-closing fourth in the Derby.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew of the Preakness horses seemed eager for a rematch. They'd seen \nenough.\u0014",

    "words": "Following Jesus\u0014\nby E. Glenn Hinson\u0014\n\u0014\n Every once in a while Christianity has raised up some people who \nbelieved the way to cut through the evil, the turmoil, and the \nconfusion of their age was to follow Jesus, especially Jesus in the \nSermon on the Mount. Names that jump out at me are Francis of Assisi, \nMother Teresa of Calcutta, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Clarence Jordan, \nthe lone Baptist. Clarence believed, You can't have great ideas in \nthe abstract. They have to take flesh. Accordingly, while a student \nat Southern Seminary, he ministered Jesus-like to the poor, the \nhomeless, the alcoholic, the lost in Louisville's Haymarket. In 1942 \nhe and his wife Florence joined a former missionary couple, Martin \nand Mabel England, in founding Koinonia Farm, where they sought to \nbuild a racially inclusive community at Americus, Georgia, which \nwould live in radical obedience to Christ and help local farmers, \nespecially the poor. When it looked in 1968 like this bold venture \nwould die, Millard Fuller joined Clarence in a new program called \nKoinonia Partners, from which has sprung Habitat for Humanity and \nJubilee Partners. For loving his enemies as Jesus taught (Matt 5:44) \nClarence paid the painful price of exclusion, ostracism, threats on \nhis life, and economic retaliation. What urged him on and sustained \nhim through it all? Those who knew Clarence Jordan well would know \nthat nothing set him apart more than an ever-present Greek New \nTestament. His Cotton Patch translating and paraphrasing of the \nscriptures bear stark testimony of a life so completely saturated by \nthe teaching of Jesus that it penetrated his every thought and \naction. He doubtless spent hours in the little shack he called his \noffice listening to God speak to him through the Jesus story and more \nhours incarnating it in the world around him.\u0014",

    "title": "FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE'S CALL TO SERVICE",
    "words": "When Florence Nightingale and her nurses showed up in the British war \nhospitals at Scutari, on the Crimean front,\u0014\n                         conditions were worse than they had heard. \nThey witnessed filth, infection, disorganization, and an overwhelming\u0014\n                         caseload. Shiploads of desperately needed \nmedical supplies sat in the harbor while men died, because some \nofficial had\u0014\n                         not filled out the proper forms. In this \nenvironment, 42 percent of the wounded never recovered. \u0014\n\u0014\n                         It took all of Nightingale's training and \ndedication, and then some, to turn things around.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Nightingale was born in Florence, Italy, \n(hence her first name) in 1820 to an English family of ample means. \nShe traveled\u0014\n                         and attended parties with the \"chosen of \nsociety\" on the family estate in Derbyshire. When she was 16, she \nreceived a\u0014\n                         divine call: \"On Feb. 7th, 1837,\" she wrote, \n\"God spoke to me and called me into his service.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                         The call was as mysterious as it was \naudiblewhat service? Seven years of uncertainty followed. Over family\u0014\n                         objections, she began \"cottage \nvisiting\"taking food and medicine to poor farmers who lived on the \nfamily's lands. Then\u0014\n                         she began to think about nursing; her family \nwas scandalized. In the early 1800s, nurses were considered unskilled\u0014\n                         laborers and were reputedly drunken and \npromiscuous. Proper ladies kept a fine house, gave parties, and made \nbrilliant\u0014\n                         conversation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         In 1844 American philanthropists Samuel and \nJulia Ward Howe (the author of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\") \nvisited\u0014\n                         the Nightingale home. Florence asked them, \n\"Do you think it would be unsuitable and unbecoming for a young\u0014\n                         Englishwoman to devote herself to works of \ncharity in hospitals?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Dr. Howe replied, \"It would be unusual, and \nin England whatever is unusual is thought to be unsuitable. But I say \nto\u0014\n                         you, 'Go forward.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n                         After that, she later wrote, \"there never \nwas any vagueness in my plans or ideas as to what God's work was for \nme.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                         That work did not begin for another nine \nyears. Family objections had to be overcome. Meanwhile she studied \nnursing,\u0014\n                         first in books, then by visiting European \nhospitals, and finally by training at hospitals in Germany, England, \nand France.\u0014\n                         She was serving as director of a home for \n\"invalid gentlewomen\" when the Crimean War (1854-56) broke out.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         When she heard about the deplorable \nconditions on the front, Nightingale took 38 nurses to see what they \ncould do.\u0014\n                         She ended up organizing the barracks \nhospital, including a kitchen, laundry, and clean latrines. She \nopened windows to\u0014\n                         let in fresh air and provided supplies by \ncutting administrative red tape or buying them herself. She provided \nreading and\u0014\n                         recreation rooms for the patients, wrote \nhome to their loved ones, and provided a safe way to mail their pay \nhome. The\u0014\n                         soldiers adored her and christened her the \n\"Lady of the Lamp,\" after the Turkish lantern she carried on her \nmidnight\u0014\n                         rounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Her efforts brought remarkable results: the \ndeath rate dropped from 42 percent to less than 3 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                                                                      \nCitation: \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                              Kelvin \nD.

    "words": "The Hidden Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\n    Each year, two million women and children worldwide have sex with \nstrangers only\u0014\n    because someone kidnaps them and threatens to kill them. You may \nhave passed\u0014\n    some of these victims on the street.\u0014\n    by Wendy Murray Zoba | posted 11/14/2003\u0014\n\u0014\n    WEARING JASMINE flowers in her hair and dressed like she was \ngoing to\u0014\n    church, 23-year-old Jyoti (not her real name) seems eager to \nplease. At the\u0014\n    same time, she appears agitated, anxious to leave a good \nimpression. Jyoti\u0014\n    doesn't remember her parents. She grew up in an orphanage in the \ncoastal\u0014\n    town of Pondicherry, in southern India. She failed her exams when \nshe was\u0014\n    17, and the overseeing nuns forced her to drop out and take up \ncooking\u0014\n    three meals a day for younger children in the orphanage.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"I was sick one day and refused to cook,\" she says. \"The sister \nasked me to\u0014\n    leave. I didn't know where to go or what to do. I took my bags \nand went to\u0014\n    the beach. I sat there crying by myself. A lady and two men \napproached and\u0014\n    asked what the matter was. I explained that I was alone. They \ntold me they\u0014\n    would find me a job as a maid. I said I needed a job and would do \nwhatever\u0014\n    they wanted.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Jyoti's story is typical and reflects the subtleties that make \nsex trafficking so\u0014\n    difficult to grasp and yet so insidious. Traffickers prey upon \nwomen and\u0014\n    children who, like her, find themselves vulnerable and afraid. \nThey took her to\u0014\n    a \"lodge,\" which Jyoti later discovered was a brothel.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Sometimes during sex the condom would tear and I was forced into \nit\u0014\n    without a condom,\" Jyoti says. \"I would be in a lot of pain. I \ndidn't know\u0014\n    anything called AIDS. When I complained, the ammas [madam] asked \nme,\u0014\n    'Why did you come here, then?' If I cried she'd say, 'Don't \npretend to cry.\u0014\n    Even if you cry your lungs out you can't leave.' One time I \nstarted vomiting\u0014\n    after meals. The owner forced me to drink beer and use paan parag \n[chewing\u0014\n    tobacco] while I was with men. I kept puking every time I had a \ndrink. I\u0014\n    realized I was pregnant. The amma told me I was a liar and that I \nhad come\u0014\n    to the lodge pregnant. She took me to a doctor for an abortion. \nHe refused\u0014\n    to perform one, saying that I was four months pregnant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Any hour, day or night, Jyoti would be summoned when a \"guest\" \nwould\u0014\n    arrive. The amma would say, \"Get ready and come down to meet \nhim.\" She\u0014\n    would then find herself behind a closed door, delivered to her \ntormenter,\u0014\n    tricked, helpless, and alone. How does one measure that? How does \none\u0014\n    report it? What is the recourse for trust betrayed? What is the \nmeasure of a\u0014\n    lost sense of self? Of perceptions of love? Of hope in God? Are \nthese\u0014\n    betrayals crimes?\u0014\n\u0014\n    They were crimes, but she was generally unable to report them. \nShe was\u0014\n    isolated in a world that had stolen her will and reduced her to \nflesh. She felt\u0014\n    like an animal and was so treated. Her countenance had changed \nfrom naive\u0014\n    hopefulness to drug-sotted lethargic despair. In most cases, \nwomen like her\u0014\n    are incapable of self-rescue.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Twice Discarded\u0014\n    Sex trafficking is buying and selling human beings (usually women \nand\u0014\n    children)\u2014and recruiting, transporting, transferring, and \nharboring them\u2014for\u0014\n    sexual exploitation. It is illegal in most countries and violates \nthe Universal\u0014\n    Declaration of Human Rights (1948), which asserts that \"everyone \nhas the\u0014\n    right to life, liberty, and security of person,\" and that \"no one \nshall be held in\u0014\n    slavery or servitude [or] \u2026 be submitted to torture.\" It is a \nvastly\u0014\n    misunderstood crime, because many people tend to perceive \nprostitutes as\u0014\n    willing participants in a \"trade.\" And some gatekeepers of public\u0014\n    morality\u2014such as corrupt local police\u2014often fail to defend, \nlet alone rescue,\u0014\n    the victimized women and children. Trafficked people are thus \ntwice\u0014\n    discarded.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Researchers estimate that two million people are enslaved by the\u0014\n    international sex market (as opposed to the general slave labor \nmarket).\u0014\n    Numbers in the U.S. domestic sex market reach the hundreds of \nthousands.\u0014\n    \"There are more slaves alive today than all the people stolen \nfrom Africa,\"\u0014\n    notes Kevin Bales in his book Disposable People (Univ. of \nCalifornia Press,\u0014\n    2000).\u0014\n\u0014\n    Forces of modernization have accelerated the resurgence of this \n\"new\u0014\n    slavery,\" as Bales calls it. The dramatic increase in world \npopulation, tripling\u0014\n    since 1945 (from about 2 to 6 billion), has overwhelmed some \ndeveloping\u0014\n    countries. Rampant unemployment and underemployment give rise to \nmasses\u0014\n    of desperate people, producing what Bales calls \"a glut of \npotential slaves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Sending\" countries supply women and children. Trafficking \nflourishes,\u0014\n    notably, in regions with the greatest population growth: \nSoutheast Asia, the\u0014\n    Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Arab world. Rapid social and \neconomic\u0014\n    change has meant that poverty has worsened for the underclass \nwhile the\u0014\n    gap between rich and poor has widened. Women and children in \neconomically\u0014\n    desperate situations easily fall prey to tricks of traffickers.\u0014\n\u0014\n    They are then moved to \"transit\" countries\u2014Mexico and Canada, \nfor example,\u0014\n    where they can more easily slip illegally into \"receiving\" \ncountries like the\u0014\n    United States, though Mexico and Canada do their own share of \nsending and\u0014\n    receiving respectively.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The U.S., Germany, and Italy are the top three destination \ncountries, with\u0014\n    the Netherlands and Japan close behind. According to one report \nby the U.N.\u0014\n    Office on Drugs and Crime (May 2003), receiving countries are \ntypically\u0014\n    developed nations.\u0014\n\u0014\n    An estimated 45,000 to 50,000 foreign women and children cross \nthe U.S.\u0014\n    borders each year as fodder for sex trafficking. A layer down, \nintrastate\u0014\n    domestic trafficking networks trade 300,000 to a million each \nyear, according\u0014\n    to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. (The fluid and \nsecretive\u0014\n    nature of the trade makes it hard to pin down more specific \nnumbers, CMEC\u0014\n    explains.) Domestically or internationally, the script is the \nsame: desperate\u0014\n    women are lured with false promises. In the U.S., for example, \nthey are\u0014\n    promised work as an au pair or a secretary, a waitress or a maid. \nBut when\u0014\n    they arrive at their destinations, the jobs aren't there. They \nend up in\u0014\n    massage parlors, escort services, and dance clubs. They are told \nthey must\u0014\n    pay the expenses incurred in finding a job: transportation, rent, \nfood. But in\u0014\n    order to earn their keep, the women and children are forced to \nsell their\u0014\n    bodies\u2014at least \"temporarily,\" they are told. But their \nso-called expenses\u0014\n    outpace their income, and victims find it almost impossible to \nbuy themselves\u0014\n    out of their captors' clutches (see \"Finding the 'Real God,' \" \nbelow).\u0014\n\u0014\n    Minnesota Nice\u0014\n    Take the case of Heidi, 41, who endured ten years of sex slavery. \nShe grew\u0014\n    up in church and was a virgin when she graduated from high \nschool. In\u0014\n    college, she experimented with alcohol and became estranged from \nher strict\u0014\n    churchgoing parents. Feeling like a failure, she latched on to a \nseemingly\u0014\n    helpful man who approached her with promises. He said he'd be her \n\"daddy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"He took time enough to be my boyfriend, then sent me out on the \nMidwest\u0014\n    circuit,\" she says. This meant she was carted around for weekly \nstints in strip\u0014\n    clubs, forced to live out of rank hotels in small towns all over \nthe Midwest.\u0014\n    Her \"daddy\" and a few of his friends had beaten and raped her a \nfew times,\u0014\n    and forced her to take addictive drugs. At the strip club, when \nshe refused\u0014\n    raunchy requests, they pelted her with empty shotgun shells. On \nanother\u0014\n    occasion a man attacked her while she was on a stage.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Who's going to protect you?\" she asks. \"You're in a dark room \nfull of gaping\u0014\n    men,\" which includes police officers, clergy, judges, and \npoliticians. \"Who are\u0014\n    you going to tell?\" she says. At the same time, Heidi's pimp was \ntelling her, \"If\u0014\n    you leave me, I'll kill you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    She hails from Minnesota, an abundant source for supplying young \nblondes to\u0014\n    the U.S. sex trade. \"A blue-eyed blonde girl gets a premium \nprice,\" she says,\u0014\n    \"as do church girls.\" \"Minnesota nice,\" as she calls it, is a \nvulnerability pimps\u0014\n    seize upon. \"It's a Scandinavian trait to be polite to people,\" \nHeidi says.\u0014\n    \"Traffickers stalk malls looking for young girls to approach with \na compliment\u0014\n    or an offer to buy a Coke.\" Midwestern girls' tendency to be \n\"nice\" allows the\u0014\n    foot in the door, she says.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In a February 2002 report titled \"The Commercial Sexual \nExploitation of\u0014\n    Children in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico,\" Richard J. Estes and \nNeil Alan\u0014\n    Weiner of the University of Pennsylvania documented that the sex \nindustry's\u0014\n    prime targets are children or youth older than 12. They are often \nrecruited by\u0014\n    peers, whom adults \"play a very active role in managing\" (with \nincentives like\u0014\n    money and drugs). Hundreds of thousands of children are at risk \nfor\u0014\n    commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking, the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Church girls go for very high prices,\" Heidi says. \"Innocence \ncan get a lot of\u0014\n    money. The 'tricks' [customers] want fresh-faced young girls.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    The New Abolitionists\u0014\n    Sex trafficking is a sophisticated network that pays off sweetly. \nIn The Inner\u0014\n    Voice of Love, Henri Nouwen describes a \"deep abyss\" in every \nhuman heart.\u0014\n    It is impossible to fill, he says, because the needs are \ninexhaustible. \"You\u0014\n    have to work around it so that gradually the abyss closes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    It is similarly impossible to fill the abyss that is sex \ntrafficking. The drives that\u0014\n    fuel it\u2014both greed and sexual desire\u2014are insatiable. Still, \nlocal champions\u0014\n    have arisen. In concert, from various fronts and on differing \nlevels here and\u0014\n    abroad, they are working around the abyss. Four mentioned here \nrepresent\u0014\n    only a few frontline activists among countless others.\u0014\nThe Salvation Army's sprightly but fierce Lisa Thompson, sharply \nbedecked in\u0014\n    the Army's signature blue and brass, leads the church's \nInitiative Against\u0014\n     Sexual Trafficking, which works with over 30 ministries, social \nagencies,\u0014\n    denominational groups, and mission organizations that attack the \nproblem.\u0014\n    Thompson and IAST members write letters to legislators and \nreligious\u0014\n    authorities, speak in churches, at conferences, and universities, \nand\u0014\n    generally try to create trouble for those who feed or abet this \nscourge.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The so-called good old boy mentality is a formidable opponent, \nshe says. It\u0014\n    reduces the sex trade to a \"boys will be boys\" proposition, which \nbreeds\u0014\n    complacency and a lack of political will. Thompson is determined \nto change\u0014\n    that.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"The historical approach has been to penalize the women as wanton\u0014\n    creatures who love sex and want easy money,\" she says. \"But \nprostitution is\u0014\n    not about the women. It is buying and selling human flesh that \nenables men\u0014\n    to have their stable of women for sex without consequences. If \nyou're\u0014\n    serious about stopping sex trafficking, then you've got to be \nserious about\u0014\n    the sex industry in general and all its disgusting and \nmultifarious forms. Lack\u0014\n    of political will in communities blinds them to what is going on \nin the\u0014\n    'gentlemen's club' on the corner. It is a blight on communities \nand the\u0014\n    breeding ground for other criminal activity. It is time for law \nenforcement,\u0014\n    prosecutors, and churches to spend time and resources to combat \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Many U.S. laws need to be changed. In some states, it's merely a\u0014\n    misdemeanor to pimp, a slap on the wrist for people who are \nessentially\u0014\n    traffickers. The most powerful element in the \ndemand-supply-distribution\u0014\n    network, pimps are too often back on the streets after paying a \nfine or\u0014\n    spending a night or two behind bars.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Thompson also says she hopes to fight bad laws before they're \ninstituted.\u0014\n    Among them is a proposal in Nevada to tax the proceeds from \nprostitution.\u0014\n    \"This would be a disaster,\" she says. \"Once the lawmakers see \nprostitution as\u0014\n    a solution to their budget problems, we'll have prostitution all \nover the place.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Self-described feminist Donna Hughes, a professor of women's \nstudies at the\u0014\n    University of Rhode Island, combats complacency in the academy. \nThrough\u0014\n    articles in academic journals, television appearances, and op-eds \nshe rallies\u0014\n    Christians and women's groups to unite in this moral battle.\u0014\n\u0014\n    What motivates her to fight, Hughes says, is the global movement \nto legalize\u0014\n    prostitution, to \"clean it up.\" Prostitution, so goes this line \nof thought,\u0014\n    \"empowers\" the women who \"choose\" the vocation. Prostitution is \nalready\u0014\n    legal in the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia, and many other \nnations are\u0014\n    considering whether to follow suit. Advocates argue that even \nprostitutes\u0014\n    can possess dignity, but Hughes counters that dignity cannot \narise from an\u0014\n    industry that misuses and molests women.\u0014\n\u0014\n    She believes that \"cleaning up\" prostitution and removing legal \nconstraints\u0014\n    actually propels the sex trafficking industry. The Netherlands is \na case in\u0014\n    point. The sex industry there is a billion-dollar business that \naccounts for 5\u0014\n    percent of the economy, an increase of 25 percent in 10 years. \nWomen in\u0014\n    the industry come from 32 different countries, signaling a \n\"predatory\u0014\n    dependence on foreign women to meet the demand for flesh in Dutch\u0014\n    brothels,\" to quote from a letter to Pope John Paul II, which \nHughes signed.\u0014\n    The government has a vested interest \"in maintaining the \ntransnational flow\u0014\n    of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation\" because \nthe\u0014\n    financial stakes are so high.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Hughes commends the State Department's Laura Lederer for breaking \nnew\u0014\n    ground in foreign aid policies. Some government aid agencies, in \nan attempt\u0014\n    to \"minimize harm\" to those active in the sex trade, have \nunwittingly\u0014\n    acquiesced to the trend of normalizing this behavior. Lederer, a \nsenior adviser\u0014\n    on trafficking in The Office of Global Affairs at the U.S. \nDepartment of State,\u0014\n    has waged this \"epic battle\" (her words) at the highest levels of \ngovernment\u0014\n    for over ten years. She describes one telling incident from a \nconference on\u0014\n    child trafficking at the Columbia School of Public Health in New \nYork. \"A\u0014\n    wonderful group of doctors, nurses, public health officials and \nNGOs\u0014\n    presented their work from all around the world. One NGO gave a \nslide\u0014\n    presentation that showed a small building behind a medical \nclinic. It turned\u0014\n    out that children\u20146, 7, and 8 years old\u2014were coming [for \ntreatment]\u0014\n    because they were involved in what the NGO called 'sex work.' The \nslide\u0014\n    presentation highlighted [workers] teaching young women and \nchildren how\u0014\n    to use condoms and how to say in English, Japanese, and German, \n'Please\u0014\n    use a condom when you penetrate me.' What started out as a way to \nkeep\u0014\n    young women and children from getting and spreading AIDS had \nbecome part\u0014\n    of the sex industry. Nobody was saying, 'This is illegal \neverywhere around the\u0014\n    world, and we need to intervene.' They were making it possible \nfor men to\u0014\n    have access to younger and younger children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Lederer quickly adds that USAID (the United States Agency for \nInternational\u0014\n    Development) would deny funding to such programs. She says grants \nare\u0014\n    dispersed in seven-figure checks to \"big Beltway organizations.\" \nThe\u0014\n    subsequent subgrants and subcontracts are difficult for USAID to \ntrack.\u0014\n    Lederer does not impugn the general work of NGOs. She salutes NGO \nworkers\u0014\n    who, often at personal risk, are rescuing women and children from \nthe world's\u0014\n    saddest places. Nevertheless, her researchers turned up \nconclusive evidence\u0014\n    that the slide presentation represented \"one of many\" such \nexamples.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Here's the good news: Lederer has seen more progress in the last \nthree years\u0014\n    than in the past twenty. She says the Trafficking Victims' \nProtection Act,\u0014\n    which became law in October 2000, \"gives organizations and law \nenforcement\u0014\n    tools to go after traffickers.\" It raises the stakes for \ntrafficking. Previously\u0014\n    the matter was addressed under transportation laws and carried a \nfive-year\u0014\n    maximum sentence for violators, most of whom ended up serving \nthree\u0014\n    months, if convicted at all. The new law ratchets up the maximum \nsentence\u0014\n    to 20 years and targets not just pimps but the entire sex \ntrafficking network:\u0014\n    recruiters, buyers, sellers, harborers, guards, and transporters \nof women and\u0014\n    children. They can and will be charged, prosecuted, and convicted \nunder this\u0014\n    new law, she says: \"It sends a strong message to traffickers. The \nlaw is the\u0014\n    model for all other laws around the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    President Bush issued a National Security Presidential Directive \n(NSPD) in\u0014\n    February that called prostitution inherently harmful and \ndegrading to women\u0014\n    and stressed the importance of identifying, protecting, and \nassisting victims\u0014\n    exploited by traffickers. It was the first NSPD ever issued on \ntrafficking. The\u0014\n    NSPD, in turn, prompted USAID administrator Andrew S. Natsios to \nannounce\u0014\n    the agency's intention to fund only those NGOs that will \"monitor \nand combat\u0014\n    this horrendous attack on the fundamental rights of vulnerable \npopulations.\"\u0014\n    In other words, USAID has moved from a position of \"minimizing \nharm\" to one\u0014\n    of \"report and rescue.\" Exactly how aid workers on the ground are \nto go\u0014\n    about the \"reporting and rescuing,\" Lederer says, is messy and \nstill being\u0014\n    worked out.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"People object that they aren't able to discern who is being \ntrafficked and\u0014\n    fear that monitoring it will put people in danger,\" she says. She \nconcedes\u0014\n    that aid workers are not police officers. At the same time, they \nare not\u0014\n    powerless. \"Anybody who encounters a six- or seven-year-old in a \nbrothel\u0014\n    can be assured that child is trafficked. They need to report to \nembassies,\u0014\n    making it clear they've seen something illegal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Hidden in Plain Sight\u0014\n    Thompson, Hughes, and Lederer are working at the grassroots, \nacademic,\u0014\n    and national levels. Al Erickson, in the meantime, works in the \nchurch. A\u0014\n    quiet, simple pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in \nAmerica, he has\u0014\n    learned dearly what the sex trade can do to a family.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In the late 1980s, a person whom he only describes as his \"loved \none\" faced\u0014\n    a hard time in college and found solace in the company of a \npolished young\u0014\n    man she met at a Christian gathering. She eventually followed him \nto\u0014\n    California\u2014\"which was a dumb thing to do, but people do dumb \nthings,\"\u0014\n    Erickson says\u2014and ended up drugged and forced into prostitution \nat the\u0014\n    point of semi-automatic weapons. \"You're caught in a terrorizing \nworld,\" he\u0014\n    says. \"If you don't understand this issue, you're probably buying \nthe lie that\u0014\n    prostitution is a choice and so think, 'My kid would never make \nthat choice.'\u0014\n    It is violent and ugly and needs to be exposed for what it really \nis.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Erickson is founder and director of Adults Saving Kids, a \nchurch-based\u0014\n    ministry to help families protect their children. Erickson's \ndenomination has\u0014\n    issued \"A Message on Commercial Sexual Exploitation\", which \nexplains sexual\u0014\n    exploitation and what churches can do to combat it. The statement \nis a\u0014\n    model other churches and denominations are following.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Erickson is troubled by the reticence he senses among Christians \nto face this\u0014\n    issue honestly and boldly. It is due in large part to the lack of \nknowledge\u0014\n    about how sexual exploitation works and what is at stake. Heidi, \nwho knows\u0014\n    Erickson and his work, concurs: \"In every church there are \nhusbands\u0014\n    addicted to pornography, a child who may be being seduced, or a \nwoman\u0014\n    who was once trapped in prostitution. But they can't talk about \nit in church.\u0014\n    So they keep it inside as a dark secret.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Donna Hughes says the sex trade \"is hiding in plain sight, in \nmassage parlors\u0014\n    you pass in shopping centers, in escort services advertised in \nyour Yellow\u0014\n    Pages.\" She and Heidi and Thompson and Lederer and Erickson would \njoin in\u0014\n    chorus encouraging citizens to act: Write letters to local \npapers; pressure\u0014\n    town councils to outlaw such places.\u0014\n\u0014\n    One citizen group Heidi knew of hovered near the parking lot of \nan adult club\u0014\n    and photographed license plates on parked cars. With the help of \nlocal police,\u0014\n    they tracked the owners and sent letters saying, \"Your car was \nseen on this\u0014\n    property.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Healing Comes\u0014\n    Jyoti tested positive for HIV and gave birth. Her baby, also \nHIV-positive, was\u0014\n    taken from her. A Christian NGO (which asked not to be named) \ntook her into\u0014\n    its care home, where she began making teddy-bear key chains and \npaper\u0014\n    flowers.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"It is very difficult for those engaged in prostitution to change \ntheir behavior\u0014\n    overnight,\" says Jyoti's counselor, Tabitha Malini. In an odd and \nheartbreaking\u0014\n    twist, some women don't want to be rescued. They become \nconditioned to\u0014\n    the degradation. \"When a woman remains in an abusive relationship \nwith a\u0014\n    partner who batters her, or even when she defends his actions, \nconcerned\u0014\n    people recognize the complexity of her compliance,\" says a report \nissued by\u0014\n    the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women International titled \n\"10 Reasons for\u0014\n    Not Legalizing Prostitution\" (March 2003). \"Like battered women, \nwomen in\u0014\n    prostitution often deny their abuse if provided with no meaningful\u0014\n    alternatives.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"We've been working with Jyoti for the past three months,\" says \nMalini. When\u0014\n    asked about her aspirations, Jyoti said she'd like to complete \nthe tenth grade,\u0014\n    work in a respectable job, and overcome her unhealthy sexual \nappetite for\u0014\n    men. She wants to be a \"good person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Heidi has overcome her unhealthy sexual appetite for men and she \nis now\u0014\n    completing a master's degree in psychology. She wants to counsel \nvictimized\u0014\n    women, and encourage them that they can recover \"through therapy,\u0014\n    twelve-step programs, and faith.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    She recalls as a young girl of 20 being trapped in a second-rate \nhotel room\u0014\n    because church women outside were holding signs that read WHORE. \nBut she\u0014\n    was a church girl at heart. \u0014\n\u0014\n    She remembers flipping through channels looking for religious \nprograms. \"I\u0014\n    remember crying, being high and beat up, but feeling too dirty to \ngo to\u0014\n    church. Christians need to understand that [the prostitute] is \nnot the enemy.\u0014\n    She's a victim. She could be your daughter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Wendy Murray Zoba is a senior writer for CT.

    "title": "FRANCIS ASBURY TACKLED AMERICA",
    "words": "August 7, 1771 \u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis Asbury Tackled America\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis Asbury was converted at 15 in his father's barn. Reared in a \nChristian home, he had been raised staunchly Church of England. But, \nas with so many others, it took the Methodist revivals to capture his \nsoul. From the instant that he was converted he saw the marks of \nsalvation in himself. He was \"...happy, free from guilt and fear, had \npower over sin, and felt great inward joy.\" His conversion also led \nhim to read the scriptures, pray and to reach out to others. He began \nmeetings with other young men and taught them the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of his conversion, Asbury had settled into work as a \nsaddler. His family was very poor and he had even had to take work at \nage 11 in order to support himself. Now he was not content merely to \nexercise his hands, however skillfully, but walked a considerable \ndistance to exercise his soul at an evangelical church where \nrevivalists spoke. He became a Methodist helper and exhorted where he \ncould, even when he was persecuted. At 17 he was licensed by the \nMethodists as a local preacher. As soon as he turned 21, he gave up \nhis saddler's work and devoted himself to preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike John Wesley, Asbury worked out a system to use his time to the \nbest advantage and develop steady habits. In short, he became \nmethodical, and this blessed his work in later years. Teaching \nhimself, he corrected serious deficiencies in his education. At four \neach morning he rose to read and study for two hours. Ten hours of \neach sixteen that he was awake he gave to reading and study. For \ninstance, at one point he gave an hour each day to studying the Old \nTestament in Hebrew, a language he taught himself. In America he \ncarried books in his saddle bags and read as he rode. He made it a \nrule to read at least 100 pages a day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne August the young man, then 26 years old, attended a Methodist \nConference held in Bristol. For months he had felt the American need. \nOn this day, August 7, 1771, when Wesley said, \"Our brethren in \nAmerica call aloud for help. Who are willing to go over and help \nthem?\" Asbury offered himself. Several other candidates also stepped \nforth, but Wesley sensed that Asbury was the man for the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's choice was vindicated. No man could have labored harder than \nAsbury. He came to small, widely scattered congregations. To meet \ntheir needs he rode incessantly--5,000 miles a year. He preached \n17,000 sermons, ordained 3,000 preachers, founded five schools and \ndistributed thousands of pieces of literature. His organizational \nskills divided America into circuits and his circuit riders learned \nthe hard life from him. Many, such as Peter Cartwright, became famous \nin their own right. At Asbury's death the Methodist Episcopal Church \nwas the largest denomination in the United States. So hard did Asbury \nwork that his health often suffered. But in him Christ once again \nshowed what he could do with a single dedicated life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsbury, Francis. The Heart of Asbury's Journal.

    "title": "FOLLOWING JESUS",
    "words": "Let's be honest: This Jesus-following thing isn't easy. That's the \ntruth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt isn't easy to get your teeth kicked in and then tell your \nattacker, \"You missed a few in the back!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt isn't easy to tell your developmentally delayed child that when \nsomeone calls him stupid, he should ask that kid to play with him and \nbe extra nice to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt isn't easy to watch people with better advertising bring people to \na church 15 miles away when you're faithfully trying to be the \npresence of Christ in their community.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt isn't easy to listen to others call you a liar or a heretic  or \nto say your ministry is invalid because you've chosen not to accept \neasy answers about the Bible and what it might really mean.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it's easy to lick wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's easy to say, \"Well, they're wrong. I've got the real Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's easy to say, \"Fight back. Call him a meaner name, write \nsomething snarky on his Facebook wall.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is easy to shout them down. And it's always easier when you can \nfind somebody to be \"them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA few months ago I went to hear a \"controversial\" pastor speak. \nOutside the church were a dedicated few with tracts, sandwich boards, \nmegaphones and protest signs  all warning us to enter the church at \nour eternal peril.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the night, during the question-and-answer, someone \nasked the pastor, \"How are you holding up?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter muttering a few words about how he was doing OK, the pastor \nstopped and said, \"I can tell you this: These two weeks have been the \nhardest two weeks of my life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe entire crowd started clapping. The young pastor downplayed it, \nbut then took a visible deep breath.\u0014\n\u0014\nI like to think he was drinking it in  this room full of people who \nwere drawn to the fact that someone could be honest about life, \nfaith, God, the Bible and all the questions those things spark.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if we walked around with sandwich boards that told the truth? \nWhat if our slogans were \"I'm sorry\" or \"The greatest of these is \nlove\" or \"I don't have it all figured out\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe it would be refreshing. Maybe people would think we were \nstrange. Maybe it would be truth-telling.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr maybe it would be just writing short sentences like Julian Koenig. \nMaybe it could be filled with grace  or at least we could be in the \nprocess.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need more comedy and less advertising. The irony that many \nchurches now refer to their congregants as \"Christ-followers\" and not \nChristians shows that we cannot easily be trusted with names, logos \nand language without somehow tainting them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat could happen if our churches told the truth about heaven and \nhell  about what we know and what we don't? About leadership? \nWealth? Government? Sexuality?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might get a laugh. It might or might not draw a crowd.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Jon Stewart knows, jokes don't work when they're lies, and people \nrarely give themselves to anything that is easy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey most often only give themselves over fully to something that has \ndrawn them in and captivated them  a story that has awakened \nsomething within them. When a person finds that thing, they'll lay \ntheir life down for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Trey Lyon\u0014",

    "title": "FOR AFGHAN WOMAN JUSTICE RUNS INTO CUSTOM",
    "words": "December 1, 2011 New York Times\u0014\nFor Afghan Woman, Justice Runs Into Unforgiving Wall of Custom\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ALISSA J. RUBIN\u0014\n\u0014\nKABUL, Afghanistan  When the Afghan government announced Thursday \nthat it would pardon a woman who had been imprisoned for adultery \nafter she reported that she had been raped, the decision seemed a \nclear victory for the many women here whose lives have been ground \ndown by the Afghan justice system. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the announcement also made it clear that there was an \nexpectation that the woman, Gulnaz, would agree to marry the man who \nraped her, the moment instead revealed the ways in which even efforts \nguided by the best intentions to redress violence against women here \nrun up against the limits of change in a society where cultural \npractices are so powerful that few can resist them, not even the \npresident. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe solution holds grave risks for Gulnaz, who uses one name, since \nthe man could be so humiliated that he might kill his accuser, \ndespite the risk of prosecution, or abuse her again. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe decision from the government of President Hamid Karzai is all the \nmore poignant coming as Western forces prepare to leave Afghanistan, \nunderscoring the unfinished business of advancing womens rights \nhere, and raising questions of what will happen in the future to \nother women like Gulnaz. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, what prompted the government to act at all was a grass-roots \nmovement that began after Gulnaz was featured in a recent documentary \nfilm commissioned by the European Union, which then blocked the \nfilms release. \u0014\n\u0014\nSupporters of the filmmakers charged that European officials were \nshying away from exposing the sort of abuses Afghan women routinely \nsuffer for fear of offending their host government. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Gulnazs pardon is a victory for both Clementine Malpas, a \nfilmmaker who spent nearly six months on the documentary, and for \nKimberley Motley, an American lawyer here who took Gulnazs case on a \npro bono basis, it also shows that for women in the justice system, \nthe odds are stacked against them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe banned film, In-Justice: The Story of Afghan Women in Jail, \nwhich was seen by The New York Times, profiles three Afghan women who \nwere in prison. One was Gulnaz, then about 19, who gave birth to the \nchild of her rapist in prison, after initially being sentenced to \nthree years. In a second trial, her sentence was increased to 12 \nyears, but a judge on camera offered her a way out: marry her rapist. \u0014\n\u0014\nA second woman in the film was abused by her husband and ran away \nwith a man she fell in love with; both are now in prison for \nadultery. The third woman was a child of 14, who appeared to have \nbeen kidnapped but was held as a runaway and has since been returned \nto her family. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the film was completed, the European Union banned its release, \neffectively silencing the women who were willing to tell their \nstories. The reason given for the ban was that the publicity could \nharm the women, because an Afghan woman who has had sex out of \nwedlock can easily become the victim of a so-called honor killing. \nThe women had not given their written consent to be in the film, said \nVygaudas Usackas, the European Unions ambassador to Afghanistan. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut an e-mail obtained by The Times from someone supportive of the \nfilmmakers suggested that the European Union also had political \nreasons for the ban. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe e-mail addressed to the filmmakers by the European Union attach \nfor justice, the rule of law and human rights, Zoe Leffler, said the \nEuropean Union also has to consider its relations with the justice \ninstitutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in \nthe sector. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if the women in the film were to give their full consent, the \nEuropean Union would not be  willing to take responsibility for the \nevents that could ensue and that could threaten the lives of the \ndocumentarys subjects, the e-mail said.\u0014",

    "words": "November 11, 1821 \u0014\nFyodor Dostoevsky: More than a Novelist\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous Russian novelist and Christian, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was \nborn on this day, November 11, 1821. From earliest childhood \nDostoyevsky knew the gospels and learned Bible stories from the \ndeacon at the hospital where his father was a doctor. As he looked \nback in later years, he rejoiced that as a child he was brought up in \na home that knew Christ, and that his mother and father had given him \nsomething holy and precious to carry him through the rest of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man, Dostoyevsky was an activist promoting the social \nideals of his day. In 1849, at age 26, he was charged with conspiracy \nagainst Tsar Nicholas' government and sentenced to death. Standing \nbefore a firing squad, he was reprieved at the last moment (the \ndramatic moment turned out to be an act staged as a terrifying \nwarning), and sent to prison in Siberia for four years. On his way, a \ngroup of women gave him a New Testament which he treasured the rest \nof his life. The underlining in his New Testament shows that he \nemphasized two themes: persecution of the just and the coming Day of \nJudgment. He believed that man's road to salvation must be through \nsuffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, his view of suffering was not pessimistic. In his writings, \nthe darkness was always lighted, however indistinctly, by the \nsufferings of Christ. The most degenerate person still retains a \nspark of God's image and must be loved as our neighbor.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also believed in God's Providence. Once, when a friend remarked \nthat his Siberian punishment had been unjust, Dostoyevsky disagreed, \npointing out that God had sent him to Siberia to teach him important \nlessons. Dostoyevsky's best known novels--The Idiot, Memoirs from \nUnderground, Crime and Punishment, and The Brothers \nKaramazov--explore man's sinful soul and show that suffering has a \npurifying effect upon an individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nDostoyevsky, an epileptic, struggled all his life with powerful \ncompulsions, such as gambling. Although he saw Christ as embodying \nfreedom for men (a freedom that the Grand Inquisitor he invented in \nThe Brothers Karamazov considers cruel, because most people can't \nbear it), Dostoyevsky never seemed to understand how to experience \nthat freedom himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died in 1881. The epitaph on his grave is from John l2:24: \"Unless \na grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains by itself \nalone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBerdyaev, Nicholas.

    "words": "November 18, 1874 \u0014\nFounding of National Woman's Temperance Union\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing like the National Women's Christian Temperance Union can be \nfound in earlier history. On this day, November 18, 1874, godly women \ngathered in Cleveland, Ohio for the purpose of creating a national \norganization to outlaw liquor. They elected Annie Wittenmeyer their \npresident, Frances E. Willard their corresponding secretary and other \nofficers. 45 years later the United States ratified the eighteenth \namendment to its constitution, prohibiting liquor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a story as big as this can be said to have a definite beginning, \nit may well have begun with a godly woman many years before. Mrs. \nDelecta Barbour Lewis was married to an abusive alcoholic. She \nexhausted herself in supporting her family. When the abuse became too \nmuch, she retreated to the attic and prayed. Her son Dio Lewis \nremembered hearing her plead on such occasions, \"O God, help me, help \nme! O Lord, how long? how long?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, she led a group of women in Albany, New York to protest in \nlocal saloons. Years later, her son, a lecturer, and a fervent \nbeliever in the power of prayer, urged women to pray and to use his \nmother's protest tactic against saloons\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen here and there were already doing that kind of thing. As early \nas 1859, a group in Baraboo, Wisconsin marched on the town's five \nliquor stores, arguing with the shop-keepers and smashing liquor kegs \nwith hatchets.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn December, 1873 a group of 208 women in Albany, New York listened \nto Dr. Dio Lewis. Singing and praying, they marched by pairs into \nlocal saloons and hotels that served spirits. On the following day, \nDecember 18, 1873, the formed the first organization to bear the name \nWoman's Christian Temperance Union. The following year, a national \norganization would assume their name at its formation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most successful of the early anti-liquor movements began not in \nNew York but in Ohio. Again Dr. Dio Lewis was behind it; in December, \n1873 he issued a challenge to the women of Hillsboro, Ohio. Eliza \nThompson was not at that meeting, but other women sent for her that \nnight and asked to join them at the Presbyterian church the next \nmorning at 9 a.m. When she hesitated, her little daughter put a Bible \nopened to Psalm 146 into her hands, saying she thought it was meant \nfor her. It is a Psalm urging trust in God and promising justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliza was elected president of the women. After praying on their \nknees, the women rose up and sang a hymn. On that day, December 23, \n1873, they marched to the places which served liquor and by appeals \nand prayer shut most of them down. Backed by their father in heaven, \nthe women of Ohio saw astonishing results. Within fifty days, they \nsaw saloons in 250 Ohio cities shut down.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Chautauqua conference the following year, Mrs. Mattie \nMcClellan Brown suggested the formation of a National organization. \nThey sent out letters and the National Woman's Christian Temperance \nUnion was the result. After Frances E. Willard won its leadership, it \nbroadened its goals and organized women to win the right to vote.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nEpstein, Barbara Leslie.

    "title": "FOR PRIESTS' WIVES, A WORD OF CAUTION",
    "words": "For Priests Wives, a Word of Caution\u0014\nBy SARA RITCHEY,   The New York Times\u0014\nPublished: January 12, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nWHAT will life be like for the wives of Roman Catholic priests? \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sunday, the Vatican announced the creation of the Personal \nOrdinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, a special division of the \nRoman Catholic Church that former Episcopal congregations and priests \n including, notably, married priests  can enter together en masse. \nThe Vatican has stressed that the allowance for married priests is \nmerely an exception (like similar dispensations made in the past by \nthe Vatican) and by no means a permanent condition of the priesthood. \nIf a priest is single when he enters the ordinariate, he may not \nmarry, nor may a married priest, in the event of his wifes death, \nremarry. \u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, the Roman Catholic Church is prepared to house married \npriests in numbers perhaps not seen since the years before 1123, when \nthe First Lateran Council adopted canon 21, prohibiting clerical \nmarriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow as then, the churchs critics and defenders are rehashing \narguments about the implications of having married priests in an \ninstitution that is otherwise wary of them. But in the midst of these \ndebates, we should pause to ponder the environment that the priests \nwives might expect to encounter. After all, the status of the \npriests wife is perhaps even more strange and unsettling than that \nof her ordained Catholic husband. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the early Christian church praised priestly chastity, it did \nnot promulgate decisive legislation mandating priestly celibacy until \nthe reform movement of the 11th century. At that point, the foremost \npurpose of priestly celibacy was to clearly distinguish and separate \nthe priests from the laity, to elevate the status of the clergy. In \nthis scheme, the mere presence of the priests wife confounded that \ngoal, and thus she incurred the suspicion, and quite often the \nloathing, of parishioners and church reformers. You cant help \nwondering what feelings she will inspire today. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of the First Lateran Council, the priests wife had \nbecome a symbol of wantonness and defilement. The reason was that \nduring this period the nature of the host consecrated at Mass \nreceived greater theological scrutiny. Medieval theologians were in \nthe process of determining that bread and wine, at the moment of \nconsecration in the hands of an ordained priest at the altar, truly \nbecame the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The priest who handled the \nbody and blood of Christ should therefore be uncontaminated lest he \ndefile the sacred corpus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe priests wife was an obvious danger. Her wanton desire, suggested \nthe 11th-century monk Peter Damian, threatened the efficacy of \nconsecration. He chastised priests wives as furious vipers who out \nof ardor of impatient lust decapitate Christ, the head of clerics, \nwith their lovers. According to the historian Dyan Elliott, priests \nwives were perceived as raping the altar, a perpetration not only of \nthe priest but also of the whole Christian community. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe priests nuclear family was also seen as a risk to the stability \nof the church. His children represented a threat to laypersons, who \nfeared that their endowments might be absorbed into the hands of the \npriests offspring to create a rival clerical dynasty. A celibate \npriest would thus ensure donations from the neighboring landed \naristocracy. Furthermore, the priests wife was often accused, along \nwith her children, of draining the churchs resources with her \nextravagance and frivolity. Pope Leo IX attempted to remedy this \nproblem in the 11th century by decreeing that the wives and children \nof priests must serve in his residence at the Lateran Palace in Rome. \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven this history, I caution the clerical wife to be on guard as she \nenters her role as a sacerdotal attach. Her position is an anomalous \none and, as the Vatican has repeatedly insisted, one that will not \nreceive permanent welcome in the church. That said, for the time \nbeing, it will be prudent for the Vatican to honor the dignity of the \nwives and children of its freshly ordained married priests. And here, \nI suggest, a real conversation about the continuation of priestly \ncelibacy might begin. \u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, priests wives should beware a religious tradition that \nviews them, in the words of Damian, as the clerics charmers, \ndevils choice tidbits, expellers from paradise, virus of minds, \nsword of soul, wolfbane to drinkers, poison to companions, material \nof sinning, occasion of death ... the female chambers of the ancient \nenemy, of hoopoes, of screech owls, of night owls, of she-wolves, of \nblood suckers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSara Ritchey is an assistant professor of medieval European history \nat the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.\u0014",

    "words": "February 4, 1874 \u0014\nFrances Havergal Wrote \"Take My Life and Let it Be\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I went for a little visit of five days,\" wrote Frances Havergal, \nexplaining what prompted her to write her well-known hymn, \"Take My \nLife and Let it Be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There were ten persons in the house; some were unconverted and long \nprayed for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians. [God] gave \nme the prayer, 'Lord, give me all in this house.' And He just did. \nBefore I left the house, everyone had got a blessing. The last night \nof my visit I was too happy to sleep and passed most of the night in \nrenewal of my consecration, and those little couplets formed \nthemselves and chimed in my heart one after another till they \nfinished with \"ever only, ALL FOR THEE!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was on this day, February 4, l874, that Frances wrote the hymn \nthat is still sung around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most dedicated Christian women of the nineteenth century, \nFrances was the youngest child of a Church of England minister. \nThough she was always in frail health, she led an active life, \nencouraging many people to turn to Jesus and others to seek a deeper \nspiritual walk.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrances had begun reading and memorizing the Bible at the age of four \n(eventually memorizing The Psalms, Isaiah and most of the New \nTestament). At seven she wrote her first poems. Several of her mature \nverses became hymns. In addition to \"Take My Life,\" she wrote such \nfavorites as \"I Gave My Life for Thee,\" \"Like a River Glorious,\" and \n\"Who Is on the Lord's Side?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause her voice was lovely, Frances was in demand as a concert \nsoloist. She also was a brilliant pianist and learned several modern \nlanguages as well as Greek and Hebrew.

    "title": "FRANCIS ASBURY TACKLED AMERICA",
    "words": "August 7, 1771 \u0014\nFrancis Asbury Tackled America\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis Asbury was converted at 15 in his father's barn. Reared in a \nChristian home, he had been raised staunchly Church of England. But, \nas with so many others, it took the Methodist revivals to capture his \nsoul. From the instant that he was converted he saw the marks of \nsalvation in himself. He was \"...happy, free from guilt and fear, had \npower over sin, and felt great inward joy.\" His conversion also led \nhim to read the scriptures, pray and to reach out to others. He began \nmeetings with other young men and taught them the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of his conversion, Asbury had settled into work as a \nsaddler. His family was very poor and he had even had to take work at \nage 11 in order to support himself. Now he was not content merely to \nexercise his hands, however skillfully, but walked a considerable \ndistance to exercise his soul at an evangelical church where \nrevivalists spoke. He became a Methodist helper and exhorted where he \ncould, even when he was persecuted. At 17 he was licensed by the \nMethodists as a local preacher. As soon as he turned 21, he gave up \nhis saddler's work and devoted himself to preaching. \u0014\n\u0014\nLike John Wesley, Asbury worked out a system to use his time to the \nbest advantage and develop steady habits. In short, he became \nmethodical, and this blessed his work in later years. Teaching \nhimself, he corrected serious deficiencies in his education. At four \neach morning he rose to read and study for two hours. Ten hours of \neach sixteen that he was awake he gave to reading and study. For \ninstance, at one point he gave an hour each day to studying the Old \nTestament in Hebrew, a language he taught himself. In America he \ncarried books in his saddle bags and read as he rode. He made it a \nrule to read at least 100 pages a day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne August the young man, then 26 years old, attended a Methodist \nConference held in Bristol. For months he had felt the American need. \nOn this day, August 7, 1771, when Wesley said, \"Our brethren in \nAmerica call aloud for help. Who are willing to go over and help \nthem?\" Asbury offered himself. Several other candidates also stepped \nforth, but Wesley sensed that Asbury was the man for the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's choice was vindicated. No man could have labored harder than \nAsbury. He came to small, widely scattered congregations. To meet \ntheir needs he rode incessantly--5,000 miles a year. He preached \n17,000 sermons, ordained 3,000 preachers, founded five schools and \ndistributed thousands of pieces of literature. His organizational \nskills divided America into circuits and his circuit riders learned \nthe hard life from him. Many, such as Peter Cartwright, became famous \nin their own right. At Asbury's death the Methodist Episcopal Church \nwas the largest denomination in the United States. So hard did Asbury \nwork that his health often suffered. But in him Christ once again \nshowed what he could do with a single dedicated life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsbury, Francis. The Heart of Asbury's Journal.

    "title": "FULTON SHEEN LISTENED TO GOD'S LEADERSHIP",
    "words": "Some will remember a man who once had an enormous impact \non American television audiences. His name was Catholic Bishop Fulton \nJ. Sheen. Sheen was known for his preaching and especially his work \non television and radio. At one time his nationally televised show \ndrew as many as 30 million viewers, making it one of the most popular \nprograms on television. How did Sheen get to where he did?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe turning point in Fulton J. Sheen's life happened when he finished \ncollege. A national examination was given to college students. The \nprize was a three-year university scholarship. Sheen took the \nexamination and won one of the scholarships. He was informed of this \nsometime during the summer and immediately went to St. Viator's \nCollege to see Father William J. Bergan, a very good friend. \u0014\n\u0014\nFather Bergan was on the tennis court when he arrived. With great \nglee and delight Sheen announced: Father Bergan, I won the \nscholarship!\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Bergan turned from his tennis playing, put his hands on \nSheen's shoulders, and looked him straight in the eyes. Father Bergan \nasked: Fulton, do you believe in God? \u0014\n\u0014\nYoung Sheen replied: You know that I do. \u0014\n\u0014\nFather Bergan said: I mean practically, not from a theoretical point \nof view. \u0014\nThis time Sheen was not so sure. He said: Well, I hope I do. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen tear up the scholarship, Father Bergan declared. \u0014\n\u0014\nFather Bergan, Sheen protested, this scholarship entitles me to \nthree years of university training with all expenses paid. It is \nworth about nine or ten thousand dollars. [This, obviously, was many \nyears ago.] \u0014\n\u0014\nBergan retorted: You know you have a vocation; you should be going \nto the seminary. \u0014\n\u0014\nSheen countered: I can go to the seminary after I get my Ph.D., \nbecause there will be little chance of getting a Ph.D. after I am \nordained, and I would like very much to have a good education. \u0014\n\u0014\nBergan repeated: Tear up the scholarship; go to the seminary. That \nis what the Lord wants you to do. And if you do it, trusting in Him, \nyou will receive a far better university education after you are \nordained than before. \u0014\n\u0014\nListen to how Fulton Sheen describes that turning point in his life, \nI tore up the scholarship and went to the seminary. I have never \nregretted that visit and that decision. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you follow God's leadership, you not only play a part in God's \ngreat plan for creation, but you find the most fulfilling life for \nyourself as well. Abraham and Sarah did as God commanded and God \nrewarded them far beyond their wildest dreams. Not as quickly as they \nmight have thought . . . God's timetable is not our timetable . . . \nBut God rewarded them far beyond anything they could ever have \nimagined. They became a blessing to the entire world. And they had a \nrich and fulfilling life as well. So can we.\u0014",

    "words": "Families in extreme poverty double\u0014\nbY Marisol Bello, USA Today  2/24/12\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of families living on $2 or less per person per day for at \nleast a month in the USA has more than doubled in 15 years to 1.46 \nmillion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's up from 636,000 households in 1996, says a new study released \nby researchers at the University of Michigan and Harvard University.\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernment benefits blunt the impact of such extreme poverty, but not \ncompletely, says one of the researchers, Luke Shaefer, a professor of \nsocial work at Michigan.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen food stamps are included as income, the number of households in \nextreme poverty, defined as living on $2 a day, drops to 800,000, \nShaefer says. That's up from 475,000 in 1996.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This seems to be a group that has fallen through the cracks,\" says \nKathryn Edin, a Harvard researcher and professor of public policy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe study found that among households in extreme poverty, one in five \nreceived rent vouchers or lived in public housing. Sixty-six percent \nhad at least one child with public health insurance. The study did \nnot factor in how those benefits affect household income.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a \nconservative think tank, says most aid to the poor today is in \nnon-cash assistance. Last year, he says, the federal and state \ngovernment spent $900 billion on 70 programs that assist the poor, \nfrom health care and food stamps to energy assistance and college \ngrants.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you look at that type of family, you don't see the type of \ndeprivation this study suggests,\" he says.\u0014\nBecause the study shows households in extreme poverty for a month, it \nis more reflective of people losing jobs, getting divorced or having \nshort-term crises, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nShaefer says, \"We are trying to document the growth in deep poverty. \n Even one month living at this level is concerning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMagdalyn March, 30, of Birmingham, Ala., can relate to those living \nin extreme poverty. In 2006, she lost a seasonal job at a packing \nwarehouse, split with an abusive boyfriend and was caring for her two \nchildren. She received about $200 a month in government cash \nassistance and $282 in food stamps.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarch and her children lived in a motel when she was with her \nboyfriend. When he left, she couldn't afford the room, and she and \nher children were kicked out. March stayed with friends and relatives \nfor a few nights at a time but ended up in a homeless shelter.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe credits the shelter, First Light, with helping her find a job as \na waitress at a chain restaurant and affordable day care. She says \nshe still struggles. She needs glasses and has to go to the dentist \nbut can't afford it. March and her children are living with her \nmother now.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You've got to come up with a system,\" she says, \"because you can't \nlive off of that. You really can't.\"\u0014",

While she is happy the elevator is there for her \nneighbors, Ms. Stember said, she prefers to take the next car, \nbecause this open door leads into a Shabbos elevator. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom sundown on Friday until the sun sets on Saturday, many observant \nJews refrain from certain activities, including pushing elevator \nbuttons, following a restriction that comes from a prohibition \nagainst creating sparks and fires. So in some buildings, elevators \nare programmed to stop automatically on every floor during the \nSabbath. That way, observant Jews can hop right in and, eventually, \nget where they are going. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese systems, long a fixture in hospitals as well, can be lifesavers \nfor older people and those with disabilities, and they allow the \nobservant to live on floors that are too high to hoof it. But they \nalso slow down elevator traffic. A lot. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts annoying, one Seward Park resident howled. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey take forever, said Michael Bolla, a managing director at \nPrudential Douglas Elliman and an observant Jew who prefers to take \nthe stairs.

He had tied a string around one \nleg of each bird. The other ends of all the strings were tied to a \nring which fit loosely over a central stick. He had taught the quail \nto walk dolefully in a circle, around and around, like mules at a \nsugarcane mill.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nobody seemed interested in buying the birds until a devout Brahman \ncame along.

    "title": "FOR RICHER OR FOR POORER",
    "words": "For Richer or Poorer\u0014\nBy Rana Foroohar Monday, Mar. 12, 2012, Time Magazine \u0014\n\u0014\nSocial issues, particularly the economics of marriage and childbirth, \nhave been major themes in the Republican primary races. As Charles \nMurray's much-talked-about book Coming Apart points out, marriage is \nbecoming a luxury good: Well-educated rich people get married and \nstay married. Most of the rest of the population doesn't. This, along \nwith a spate of studies about the growing number of low-income, \nsingle-parent families, has spurred a debate about whether government \nshould push marriage as a poverty-elimination tool. But is it really \nthat simple? To quote Beyonc, would poverty go away if we \"put a ring \non it\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nStatistically it's true that people who have finished high school and \nare married are less likely to be poor, particularly when you throw \nchildren into the mix. But just as government efforts to create an \n\"ownership society\" via mass access to mortgages didn't end well, \npolicies that push marriage aren't necessarily the way to bolster \nprosperity. The causalities of wedlock and the ways in which we \ncapture its economic benefits are, as it turns out, as complex as \nmarriage itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe institution has been losing ground for decades. A recent Pew \nstudy found that the national marriage rate has hit an all-time low. \nMeanwhile, the percentage of children born out of wedlock has been \nrising: it's now 41% overall and 53% for those born to women under 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the statistic we should really care about, according to \nexperts like Isabel Sawhill at the Brookings Institution. \"I don't \nthink people would worry about the decline of marriage if it wasn't \nfor the effect on kids,\" she says. \"All the research shows that \nthere's tremendous turmoil in the lives of children born out of \nwedlock.\" Not only are their parents poorer, but they also have a \ntendency to move in and out of relationships faster. According to \nPrinceton professor Sara McLanahan, it's not unusual for a single or \ncohabiting parent to have three partners over the course of five \nyears and multiple children with different partners. Forget about \nmoral judgment; the issue is that this rotating cast of characters \ncan create complexity and volatility in the lives of these families.\u0014\n\u0014\nCohabitation isn't always associated with such turmoil. In many parts \nof Europe, couples live together without marrying at much greater \nrates across the socioeconomic spectrum, and many of those nonmarital \nunions are more stable than our married ones. (In France the average \nlength of cohabitation is 9.5 years; in the U.S. it's 1.17.) They \nalso tend to lead to marriage more frequently: In Sweden, 82% of \ncohabiting couples end up sealing the deal. In the U.S., fewer than \nhalf do.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the U.S., the issue of instability and cohabitation is \ncrucial, because an increasing amount of data shows that poverty is \nas closely correlated with emotional and financial volatility as it \nis with absolute income. In short, people who are constantly living \non the edge are more likely to fall over it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite all that, researchers who study that correlation, like \nMcLanahan, say pushing people who aren't ready into marriage isn't \nthe solution. \"Bush-era programs encouraging people to marry have \nreally had no effect,\" McLanahan says. Indeed, previously cohabiting \nAmerican couples who marry have higher-than-average divorce rates. \nBottom line: you can't reverse-engineer marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does help create more stable families? Birth control--because \nthree-quarters of births outside marriage are unintended, according \nto sociologist Jennifer Manlove of Child Trends, a nonprofit that \nstudies childhood development. Particularly among 20-somethings, the \nfastest-growing group of unmarried moms, there's a tendency to use \nless reliable means of birth control, like condoms and the withdrawal \nmethod. Their European peers, who often get free, state-funded health \ncare, tend to use more expensive but more reliable methods like the \nPill and IUDs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother thing we might do to create more stable, two-parent families \nis help men find jobs. The retreat from wedlock has occurred in \ntandem with the economic decline of working-class men. Marriage \nrates, along with the wages of less educated men, have been falling \nfor four decades. Many experts who study the economics of marriage \nsee a connection between those two trends. There simply aren't as \nmany steadily employed, marriageable men as there used to be, so \nwomen--particularly poorer ones--end up going it alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll this presents an interesting campaign conundrum for Republicans. \nIt turns out that bailing out Detroit may be a better way to boost \nmarriage than promoting abstinence. Note to President Obama's \ncampaign managers: Put a ring on that\u0014",

    "title": "FROM PASSOVER TO ARREST",
    "words": "Mark 14:26-31. Sad Words. After they had sung a hymn, perhaps one of \nthe psalms (like 114-118), they go out to the Mount of Olives, which \nis associated with the coming of the Messiah (see Zechariah 14:4 \nwhere this is the place where God will judge the nations). But as \nthey go, Jesus uses the image of how when a shepherd is hurt, sick, \nor perhaps struck down by thieves (this is also a reference to \nZechariah 13:7), the sheep are confused and frightened and so they \nscatter. \"This is what you all will do,\" Jesus says. But Peter \nreplies, \"No way. Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny \nyou.\" The others say the same. But to Peter Jesus says, \"Before the \ncock crows twice tonight, you will deny even knowing me three times.\" \nJust as Jesus knew what was in the heart of Judas, he also knows the \nhearts of the others. But he tries to assure them (see v. 28 in which \nhe tells them he will arise and meet them in Galilee, but they do not \nhear or understand this). There are echoes here of the Psalm 31 \nreading, especially the sense of abandonment and utter aloneness.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark 14:32-42. Jesus in Gethsemane. Gethsemane means \"olive press.\" \nIt's the name apparently of an olive grove on the Mount of Olives, \nperhaps a favorite place for Jesus and the disciples. It held little \npeace and tranquility this night. The words used to describe Jesus \nhere are strong: \"greatly distressed and troubled.\" Jesus faces the \nprospect of death like any human being would -- with dread, fear, and \neven sorrow. Jesus was truly human. He falls to the ground and prays \nthat the cup might pass from him and that another way might be found. \nBut in the end submits fully to God's will. He goes back several \ntimes to gain some comfort perhaps from his three disciples but they \nare fast asleep. He cares for them even now as he encourages them to \nwatch, wait, and pray for themselves so that they might have the \nstrength to face the coming trial. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark 14:43-52. Jesus Is Arrested. Judas comes with a gang of men \ncarrying clubs and swords. They may have been part of the temple \npolice, a group overseen by the religious leaders of the Sanhedrin. \nSince they do not know Jesus by sight and it was dark, Judas gave \nthem a signal. The one he kissed would be the one (a kiss from an \naccepted form of greeting between disciple and master, and recall how \nPaul exhorts to \"greet one another with a holy kiss\") Here it is like \nbeing embraced by someone with a knife in his hand to stab you. Such \nshows the hardness of heart of Judas. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the disciples grabs a sword and cuts off the ear of one of \nthose with Judas. John says this was Peter and the man cut was named \nMalchus (see John 18:10-11). In Luke's version, Jesus condemns this \naction and heals the man's ear. \"Those who take up the sword, perish \nby it,\" he says. It is exactly the kind of action many would have \nhim, Jesus, take. But that was the way of violence. Jesus would meet \nviolence with love and overcome it.\u0014",

I've \nbeen thinking about it myself, and there are so many things to \nconsider.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know that you really deserve to retire; part-time is the way to go. \nWe support you.\u0014\n\u0014\nCindy\u0014\n---------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nI grew up in a church where the pastor WAS the church.  Every part of \nthe church's ministry had his finger prints on it.  This is the way I \npatterned my own ministries thinking it was the way things should be \ndone - until I met you.  Your view was that the deacons and other \nleaders were to take the responsibility of \"running\" the church and \nthe pastor was responsible for spiritual leadership.  I first thought \nyou were wrong but later came to see the wisdom in this approach.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you emailed your plans several days ago, you asked us what we \nthought about them and I told you.  There is no such request here so \nI will only wish you well in your plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am sure it was difficult for you and Jane to come to this decision \nand you must be having thoughts of uncertainty.  Very soon after you \nleave you will feel confident in your decision.  There are very few \njobs that are more full-time than the ministry.  You will come to \nrealize the job was more possessive than you had realized.  After \nhaving been dedicated to the ministry for so long, you will enjoy the \nfreedom of you new life.  I know there some guys who believe they \nshould \"preach\" until their finial breath even if they have to be \ncarried to the pulpit on a stretcher.  That shows little confidence \nin the Kingdom of God. Our witness should never be silenced, but take \nheart that God will fill the pulpit.  Have confidence that will \nhappen so you can be free to enjoy your family and whatever else God \nhas in store for you.  You write very well, maybe there is a bright \nfuture there.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know I do not need to give you suggestions on how to live your \npost-pastor life, I am just trying to pursuade you not to feel like \nyou are abandoning God or County Line Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod bless, I will pray for the Skaggs clan.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Strong, a friend\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------\u0014",

Cory is \nalso able to feed himself only after countless days of practicing \nwith his dad. \"It was really messy,\" Cory said, \"but we did it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTogether they drive to campus in Dale's truck, where they go from a \nstreet parking spot to Cory's first class, with Cory wheeling himself \nmost of the way. Dale says, \"I see all these college kids running and \nskating across campus, and then I see Cory just chugging along in his \nchair, the world moving past him  and I am so, so proud of him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We live for the little victories,\" Cory says. \"We're a team.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter lunch, they go to a gym for therapy, and then his father might \ndrop him off at a Sun Devils baseball practice or game before taking \nhim home for the night. Cory will hang out with friends until about \n11 P.M., at which point his father returns to his room to lay him \ninto bed and put the television on a timer and slip out with a \nsimple, \"Good night, buddy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you're a dad, you're a dad forever,\" Dale says.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Bill Plaschke, \"Cory Hahn is still part of a team,\" Los \nAngeles Times\u0014",

    "words": "February 4, 1874 \u0014\nFrances Havergal Wrote \"Take My Life and Let it Be\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I went for a little visit of five days,\" wrote Frances Havergal, \nexplaining what prompted her to write her well-known hymn, \"Take My \nLife and Let it Be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There were ten persons in the house; some were unconverted and long \nprayed for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians. [God] gave \nme the prayer, 'Lord, give me all in this house.' And He just did. \nBefore I left the house, everyone had got a blessing. The last night \nof my visit I was too happy to sleep and passed most of the night in \nrenewal of my consecration, and those little couplets formed \nthemselves and chimed in my heart one after another till they \nfinished with \"ever only, ALL FOR THEE!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was on this day, February 4, l874, that Frances wrote the hymn \nthat is still sung around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most dedicated Christian women of the nineteenth century, \nFrances was the youngest child of a Church of England minister. \nThough she was always in frail health, she led an active life, \nencouraging many people to turn to Jesus and others to seek a deeper \nspiritual walk.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrances had begun reading and memorizing the Bible at the age of four \n(eventually memorizing The Psalms, Isaiah and most of the New \nTestament). At seven she wrote her first poems. Several of her mature \nverses became hymns. In addition to \"Take My Life,\" she wrote such \nfavorites as \"I Gave My Life for Thee,\" \"Like a River Glorious,\" and \n\"Who Is on the Lord's Side?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause her voice was lovely, Frances was in demand as a concert \nsoloist. She also was a brilliant pianist and learned several modern \nlanguages as well as Greek and Hebrew. With all her education, \nhowever, Frances Havergal maintained a simple faith and confidence in \nher Lord. She never wrote a line of poetry without praying over it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the lines of Frances Havergal's hymn says, \"Take my silver and \nmy gold; not a mite would I withhold.\" In 1878, four years after \nwriting the hymn, Miss Havergal wrote a friend, The Lord has shown me \nanother little step, and, of course, I have taken it with extreme \ndelight. 'Take my silver and my gold' now means shipping off all my \nornaments to the Church Missionary House, including a jewel cabinet \nthat is really fit for a countess, where all will be accepted and \ndisposed of for me...Nearly fifty articles are being packed up. I \ndon't think I ever packed a box with such pleasure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\n\"Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879).\" http://www.cyberhymnal.org\u0014\n\"Havergal, Frances Ridley.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch, edited by F.

    "title": "FORGIVENESS IS SOMETHING YOU DO FOR YOURSELF",
    "words": "FORGIVENESS IS SOMETHING YOU DO FOR YOURSELF \u0014\nFisher Humphreys, Ph.D. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus forgave his enemies. While hanging on the cross, he prayed that \nGod would forgive those who had crucified him. Jesus also called his \nfollowers to forgive their enemies. Every time we pray the Lord's \nPrayer, we ask God to \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those \nwho trespass against us.\" In case we didn't quite get the point, \nJesus added, \"If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly \nFather will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, \nneither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nForgiving the people who wrong us and hurt us, is one of the most \nbeneficial things Jesus has called us to do. It also is one of the \nmost difficult. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Forgiveness Is \u0014\n\u0014\nForgiveness is difficult because it is contrary to what we \ninstinctively want to do. Forgiveness begins when you are deeply hurt \nby someone. Maybe it's a fellow church member or an entire church. \nYou aren't perfect, but you did not deserve the hurt you have \nexperienced. It's not fair. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you respond when you are hurt unfairly? You know that Jesus \nhas told you to forgive. But what does that mean? It means, I think, \nthat you suffer in a special way. In order to forgive, you must \nexperience two distinct kinds of pain. First comes the pain of being \ntreated unfairly. There is no way to avoid this pain. But in order to \nforgive you must experience a second kind of pain.\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen you're treated unfairly, you become angry. No one has to learn \nto do this; it is a natural instinct. Even small children do it. \nBecause you are angry, you naturally want to retaliate. This also is \ninstinctive rather than learned. We want to hit back. We want to hurt \nthose who hurt us. We want revenge. It is controversial to say this, \nbut I believe that you are entitled to retaliate. It's only fair. An \neye for an eye, \u0014\na tooth for a tooth - that balances the scales. That's justice.\u0014\n \u0014\nBut it's not forgiveness. Forgiveness goes beyond justice. It is an \nact of generosity and grace toward those who hurt you. In forgiveness \nyou do not express your anger by retaliating. Instead, you \nvoluntarily embrace the pain of your anger. You absorb your anger. \nYou don't repress or deny it, but you accept it and then live through \nit, in such a way as to drain the poison off of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is what forgiveness is: absorbing the pain caused by people who \nhurt you, and also absorbing the anger you naturally feel because you \nhave been hurt, to neutralize your anger and end its destructive \npower in your life and in the lives of others.\u0014\n\u0014\n\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1clearly \nthis is not fair. You didn't hurt the other person; the other person \nhurt you. You shouldn't have to suffer; the person who hurt you \nshould have to suffer. But in the real world of moral relationships, \nit is the injured party alone who can forgive, and that means that it \nis the injured person who must suffer. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Helps You to Forgive \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause forgiveness is so hard, we need all the help we can get if \nwe're going to do it. One thing that helps is simply to decide, \nintentionally, that you want to forgive. Because the natural response \nto being hurt is to retaliate, forgiveness is a response we have to \nmake intentionally. Here are some other \u0014\nthings that help:\u0014\n \u0014\n\tBelong to a community that supports you as you attempt to practice \nforgiveness. Many communities do not believe in forgiveness. They \nthink it is a sign of weakness or of moral indifference. Those \ncommunities will encourage you to seek revenge. The church, when it \nis faithful to the message of the Lord Jesus, will support you as you \nattempt to practice forgiveness. Of course, sometimes it is a church \nwhich has hurt you. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tTry to understand those who hurt you. Maybe they have been hurt \nthemselves. Maybe they are having a lot of problems right now. You \ndon't excuse them, but you do try to understand them, to see their \nhumanity, and so not to demonize them. \u0014\n\u0014\n\t Think about the future, about what will happen if you don't \nforgive and what will     \u0014\n happen if you do. If you don't forgive, you'll continue to live with \nyour anger. It may           \u0014\n take the form of hot rage or of cool resentment. Either way, it is \nstill anger, and you   \u0014\n know what it will make you do. It will make you miserable. It may \neven make you  \u0014\n physically ill. If you bottle up your anger, if you let it make you \nseek revenge, you \u0014\n can get hypertension, ulcers, lesions, headaches, and insomnia. And \nit will hurt \u0014\n others, too. As Gandhi said, if the world lives by the principle of \nan eye for an eye, \u0014\n it will become a world full of blind people. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you do forgive you will neutralize the pain that is destructive to \nyour health and happiness. Then you can begin to experience healing \nfrom your hurts. In this sense forgiveness is something you should do \nfor yourself as well as for the Lord. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article: See Word/My Documents/ Forgiveness is Somthing You \ndo For Yourself\u0014",

    "words": "FLY AWAY HOME, a book review\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Chess Heart  \u0014\n\u0014\n\"My dad and I live in an airport. That's because we don't have a home \nand the airport is better than the streets. We are careful not to get \ncaught.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo begins Ms. Bunting's 1991 story, \"Fy Away Home\" about a homeless \nchild and his father who live in an airport, spending their days \ntrying to blend in and stay under the radar of local security.\u0014\n\u0014\nTold from the child's persepective, FAH is not an easy book to read, \neven (and perhaps especially) for adults. Andrew, the narrator, \nfrankly discusses how he and his dad avoid detection by wearing blue, \nchanging terminals, keeping clean in the bathrooms and sleeping \nsitting up. A number of their fellow homeless friends have been \ndiscovered and tossed out, usually for loud or unusual behavior. It's \nterribly important to Andrew and his dad that they be as invisable as \npossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew tells how his dad takes the bus on weekends to a job where \nhe's a janitor and how the Medinas, another homeless family, watch \nover Andrew on those days. Dad fishes newspapers out of the trash and \nmakes phone calls, presumably about renting an apartment, but always \nreturns disappointed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crux of the book comes when Andrew discovers a bird trapped \ninside the airport. He keeps an eye on it until one day the sliding \nglass doors open for just a second and whoosh! the bird flies away to \nfreedom. This becomes a sort of metaphor for Andrew as he stands at \nthe window, watching the planes take off at the end; an end in which \nwe don't know what will become of Andrew or his dad.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fly Away Home\" was clearly written before the security crackdown \nafter 9/11, but the message will still ring true to post-9/11 \nreaders. There's a sadness and frustration that runs through the \nbook, and a low level of fear of discovery: it's obvious that if \nAndrew and his dad are discovered, they'll be turned out and who \nknows what will happen next. Still, there's a feeling of hope to the \nbook and the certainty that, as humans, we can adapt to anything; \n\"it's nice right here, though, isn't it, Andrew? it's warm. It's \nsafe. And the price is right.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Family Life According to the Brotherhood\u0014\nBy MONA EL-NAGGAR\u0014\nPublished: September 4, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nCAIRO  Women are erratic, emotional, and they make good wives and \nmothers but never a leader or ruler. Or so Osama Abou Salama, \nprofessor of botany at Cairo University and member of the Muslim \nBrotherhood, told young men and women in premarital counseling \nclasses. The women did not object.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the Muslim Brotherhood rose to power, much of the uncertainty \nover its social agenda is stirred by its undefined attitude toward \nwomen. Will the Brotherhoods leaders try to impose a conservative \ndress code? Will they bar women from certain fields of work? Will \nthey promote segregation at schools? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a country where the vast majority of women already cover their \nhair, disregard any collective call for action and voluntarily \nseparate from men in coed environments, that may seem academic. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Abou Salama asks anyway. Can you, as a woman, take a \ndecision and handle the consequences of your decision? A number of \nwomen shook their head. No. But men can. And God created us this way \nbecause a ship cannot have more than one captain. \u0014\n\u0014\nNone of the 30 or so young men and women in the class winced. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than any other political group in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood \nis most fluent in the dialect of the masses. By upholding patriarchal \nand traditional values around a womans place in society, it garners \npopular support, builds political capital and reinforces a socially \nconservative paradigm. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman is the symbol of a moral platform through which easy gains \ncan be made, said Hania Sholkamy, anthropologist and associate \nprofessor at the Social Research Center of the American University in \nCairo. Those who deprive women of their rights, limit their freedom \nor place them in a subordinate position believe that the political \ncost of doing so is very low. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lectures of Mr. Abou Salama, who has raised three daughters, are \npart of a four-week workshop dubbed Bride and Groom Against Satan and \nsponsored by Family House, a Muslim Brotherhood-funded charity. Among \nits many activities, Family House offers financial support to \nstruggling households, provides a matchmaking service and sponsors \nmass weddings for low-income couples. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is part of the reformist methodology of the Muslim \nBrotherhood, explains Walaa Abdel Halim, the Family House \ncoordinator who organizes the youth counseling workshop. Shaping a \nrighteous individual leads to shaping a righteous family and by \nshaping a righteous family, you get a righteous society that can \nchoose a righteous leader. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor Ms. Abdel Halim, 22, her efforts bore fruit when Mohamed Morsi \nwas elected president in June. At the time, Mr. Morsi gave assurances \nto protect the rights of women and include them in decision-making. \nLess than three months into his presidency, Mr. Morsi has already \nbroken a campaign promise to appoint a woman as vice president. \nInstead, he named a team of 21 senior aides and advisers last week \nthat includes three women. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf those three, Omaima Kamel is a medical professor at Cairo \nUniversity and member of the Muslim Brotherhood since 1981. One of \nher main areas of work and interest, she says, is women.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nThe Great Disappointment was a major event in the history of the \nMillerite movement, a 19th-century \\American \\Christian sect that \nformed out of the Second Great Awakening. Based on his \ninterpretations of the prophecies in the book of Daniel (Chapters 8 \nand 9, especially Dan. 8:14 \"Unto two thousand and three hundred \ndays; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed\"), William Miller, a \nBaptist preacher, proposed that Jesus Christ would return to the \nearth during the year 1844. The more specific date of October 22, \n1844, was preached by Samuel S. Snow. Thousands of followers, some of \nwhom had given away all of their possessions, waited expectantly. \nWhen Jesus did not appear, October 22, 1844, became known as the \nGreat Disappointment. Those who stayed with the movement, founded \nwhat is called the Seventh Day Adventist denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain they hold the typical fundamentals of the faithliteral and \ninerrant Bible, which includes the Old Testament. They SAY they hold \nall of the Bible as inerrant, but they don't. Nobody does. This would \ninclude killing your child by stoning for disobedience, selling your \ndaughter, etc. They explain that away, but they do hold to the \nliteral commandments, thus insist upon the Sabbath as the day of \nworship. Their statement about this is:\u0014\n\u0014\nSabbath Day. \u0014\nThe beneficent Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the \nseventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial \nof Creation. The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law \nrequires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of \nrest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice \nof Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful \ncommunion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption \nin Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, \nand a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath \nis God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His \npeople. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, \nsunset to sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive \nacts.\u0014\n\u0014\nEllen White became their early day prophet and still compare their \nunderstanding of scripture with what she wrote. I call her the \nSeventh Day pope. Most of her writings are not out in left field, at \nleast what I've read. Here's what they say about that:\u0014\n\u0014\nGift of Prophecy. \u0014\nOne of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an \nidentifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the \nministry of Ellen. G. White . As the Lord's messenger, her writings \nare a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for \nthe church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also \nmake clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and \nexperience must be tested.\u0014",

    "words": "The Gospel of Jesuss Wife  A historian of early Christianity at \nHarvard Divinity School has identified a papyrus fragment in the \nCoptic language that she says contains the first known statement \nsaying that Jesus was married. The fragment also refers to a female \ndisciple\u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 18, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nA Faded Piece of Papyrus Refers to Jesus Wife\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LAURIE GOODSTEIN\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                       Translated \nlegible text: \u0014\n\u0014\nnot [to] me.

A historian of early Christianity at Harvard \nDivinity School has identified a scrap of papyrus that she says was \nwritten in Coptic in the fourth century and contains a phrase never \nseen in any piece of Scripture: Jesus said to them, My wife ...  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe faded papyrus fragment is smaller than a business card, with \neight lines on one side, in black ink legible under a magnifying \nglass. Just below the line about Jesus having a wife, the papyrus \nincludes a second provocative clause that purportedly says, she will \nbe able to be my disciple. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe finding was made public in Rome on Tuesday at an international \nmeeting of Coptic scholars by Karen L. King, a historian who has \npublished several books about new Gospel discoveries and is the first \nwoman to hold the nations oldest endowed chair, the Hollis professor \nof divinity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe provenance of the papyrus fragment is a mystery, and its owner \nhas asked to remain anonymous. Until Tuesday, Dr. King had shown the \nfragment to only a small circle of experts in papyrology and Coptic \nlinguistics, who concluded that it is most likely not a forgery. But \nshe and her collaborators say they are eager for more scholars to \nweigh in and perhaps upend their conclusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven with many questions unsettled, the discovery could reignite the \ndebate over whether Jesus was married, whether Mary Magdalene was his \nwife and whether he had a female disciple. These debates date to the \nearly centuries of Christianity, scholars say. But they are relevant \ntoday, when global Christianity is roiling over the place of women in \nministry and the boundaries of marriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe discussion is particularly animated in the Roman Catholic Church, \nwhere despite calls for change, the Vatican has reiterated the \nteaching that the priesthood cannot be opened to women and married \nmen because of the model set by Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. King gave an interview and showed the papyrus fragment, encased \nin glass, to reporters from The New York Times, The Boston Globe and \nHarvard Magazine in her garret office in the tower at Harvard \nDivinity School last Thursday . She left the next day for Rome to \ndeliver her paper on the find on Tuesday at the International \nCongress of Coptic Studies. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe repeatedly cautioned that this fragment should not be taken as \nproof that Jesus, the historical person, was actually married. The \ntext was probably written centuries after Jesus lived, and all other \nearly, historically reliable Christian literature is silent on the \nquestion, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the discovery is exciting, Dr. King said, because it is the first \nknown statement from antiquity that refers to Jesus speaking of a \nwife. It provides further evidence that there was an active \ndiscussion among early Christians about whether Jesus was celibate or \nmarried, and which path his followers should choose. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis fragment suggests that some early Christians had a tradition \nthat Jesus was married, Dr. King said. There was, we already know, \na controversy in the second century over whether Jesus was married, \ncaught up with a debate about whether Christians should marry and \nhave sex. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. King first learned about what she calls The Gospel of Jesuss \nWife when she received an e-mail in 2010 from a private collector \nwho asked her to translate it. Dr. King, 58, specializes in Coptic \nliterature, and has written books on the Gospel of Judas, the Gospel \nof Mary of Magdala, Gnosticism and women in antiquity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe owner, who has a collection of Greek, Coptic and Arabic papyri, \nis not willing to be identified by name, nationality or location, \nbecause, Dr. King said, He doesnt want to be hounded by people who \nwant to buy this. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen, where or how the fragment was discovered is unknown. The \ncollector acquired it in a batch of papyri in 1997 from the previous \nowner, a German. It came with a handwritten note in German that names \na professor of Egyptology in Berlin, now deceased, and cited him \ncalling the fragment the sole example of a text in which Jesus \nclaims a wife. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe owner carried the fragment to the Divinity School in December \n2011 and left it with Dr. King. She said she was initially \nsuspicious, but it looked promising enough to explore. Three months \nlater, she carried the fragment in her red handbag to New York to \nshow it to two colleagues, both papyrologists: Roger Bagnall, \ndirector of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, at New \nYork University, and AnneMarie Luijendijk, an associate professor of \nreligion at Princeton University. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey examined the scrap under sharp magnification. It was very small \n only 4 by 8 centimeters. The lettering was splotchy and uneven, the \nhand of an amateur, but not unusual for the time period, when many \nChristians were poor and persecuted. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was written in Coptic, an Egyptian language that uses Greek \ncharacters  and more precisely, in Sahidic Coptic, a dialect from \nsouthern Egypt, Dr. Luijendijk said in an interview. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat convinced them it was probably genuine was the fading of the ink \non the papyrus fibers, and traces of ink adhered to the bent fibers \nat the torn edges. The back side is so faint that only five words are \nvisible, one only partly: my moth[er], three, forth which. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be impossible to forge, said Dr. Luijendijk, who \ncontributed to Dr. Kings paper. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Bagnall reasoned that a forger would have had to be expert in \nCoptic grammar, handwriting and ideas. Most forgeries he has seen \nwere nothing more than gibberish. And if it were a forgery intended \nto cause a sensation or make someone rich, why would it have lain in \nobscurity for so many years? \u0014\n\u0014\nIts hard to construct a scenario that is at all plausible in which \nsomebody fakes something like this. The world is not really crawling \nwith crooked papyrologists, Dr. Bagnall said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe piece is torn into a rough rectangle, so that the document is \nmissing its adjoining text on the left, right, top and bottom  most \nlikely the work of a dealer who divided up a larger piece to maximize \nhis profit, Dr. Bagnall said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the context, therefore, is missing. But Dr. King was struck \nby phrases in the fragment like My mother gave to me life, and \nMary is worthy of it, which resemble snippets from the Gospels of \nThomas and Mary. Experts believe those were written in the late \nsecond century and translated into Coptic. She surmises that this \nfragment is also copied from a second century Greek text. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe meaning of the words, my wife, is beyond question, Dr. King \nsaid. These words can mean nothing else. The text beyond my wife \nis cut off. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. King did not have the ink dated using carbon testing. She said it \nwould require scraping off too much, destroying the relic. She still \nplans to have the ink tested by spectroscopy, which could roughly \ndetermine its age by its chemical composition. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. King submitted her paper to The Harvard Theological Review, which \nasked three scholars to review it. Two questioned its authenticity, \nbut they had seen only low-resolution photographs of the fragment and \nwere unaware that expert papyrologists had seen the actual item and \njudged it to be genuine, Dr. King said. One of the two questioned the \ngrammar, translation and interpretation. \u0014\n\u0014\nAriel Shisha-Halevy, an eminent Coptic linguist at Hebrew University \nin Jerusalem, was consulted, and responded in an e-mail in September, \nI believe  on the basis of language and grammar  the text is \nauthentic. \u0014\n\u0014\nMajor doubts allayed, The Review plans to publish Dr. Kings article \nin its January issue. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe owner has offered to donate the papyrus to Harvard if the \nuniversity buys a substantial part of his collection, Dr. King \nsaid, which Harvard is considering. She said she will push him to \ncome forward, in part to avoid stoking conspiracy theories. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe notion that Jesus had a wife was the central conceit of the best \nseller and movie The Da Vinci Code. But Dr. King said she wants \nnothing to do with the code or its author: At least, dont say this \nproves Dan Brown was right.\u0014",

Shane \nand Marlen Roessiger of Venice, Fla. host weekly prayer and study \ngatherings, which are attended by as many as 10 people. The family is \nalso facing fines for putting a small sign in their front yard that \nreads: Need Prayer (941) 484-4915. It's difficult to understand \nhow it is illegal to have a prayer meeting on Friday night with a \nhalf dozen people but it is alright if I invited the same group on \nMonday evening to watch Monday Night Football, Roessiger said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pacific Justice Institute is representing the family.

That may be fine in some \ntyrannical parts of the world. That is not okay in the United States \nof America.Pam Johnson, a spokesperson for the city of Venice, sent \na statement defending their actions to Fox News. She confirmed that \nthe two cases against the family involve a code infraction regarding \nthe use of a sign and a zoning infraction regarding using their home \nas a 'house of worship.' The Roessigers run a small ministry called \nIn Him Healing Touch Ministries. Dacus believes the city used that \nto build a case against the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 9/18/12\u0014",

    "title": "FAREWELL TO AFGHANISTAN, WITH SADNESS AND AFFECTION",
    "words": "Farewell to Afghanistan, with sadness and affection\u0014\n\u0014\nA Times correspondent ending a three-year assignment reflects on the \nfears and horrors, but also on the beauty and people that will make \nher miss Afghanistan. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Laura King, Los Angeles Times      October 22, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nKABUL, Afghanistan  After years of comings and goings, almost \neverything about leaving Kabul is familiar: the ride through dusty \ndawn streets, skirting past old men on bicycles and boys in \nhorse-drawn carts, the long airport trudge through four luggage \nscreenings and pat-downs, the way the plane's wingtips seem to almost \nscrape the jagged peaks surrounding the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything is the same  but the knowledge that this is the last time.\u0014\n\u0014\nKabul has been home for more than three years, but on this trip my \nassignment as a foreign correspondent here is ending, and I will join \nthe American exodus from its long war in Afghanistan.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost everyone here and at home shares the same perception: that \nAmericans want to put this war in their rear-view mirror. But for \nmany Afghans, too, there's a bone-weariness with the foreign \npresence, outweighing even the fear of what will happen after most \ninternational forces leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times, the sense of growing hostility is both palpable and \npersonal: the neck-prickling sensation as you walk past an Afghan \npolice post and feel the hostile gaze, or the female guard who turns \na routine body search into a wholesale mauling, simply because she \ncan.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut nearly every ugly experience is balanced by moments that make the \nheart lift: an elderly neighbor who beams as he presents a bunch of \nsweet-to-the-point-of-bursting grapes from the family farm outside \nKabul, the schoolgirls in their white head scarves who shyly call out \n\"How-are-YOU?\" before dissolving into giggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd even in a city deformed by blast walls and barricades, with \nstreets lined by open sewage ditches, beauty steals its way in. \nThere's the peacock strutting at dusk among the rosebushes, the warm \nsmell of Afghan bread wafting from the corner bakery, an overnight \ndusting of snow in the ring of mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, it's clear just how messy the winding-down process is likely \nto be. Insider attacks  Afghan police and soldiers turning their \nguns on NATO troops  occur with clocklike regularity. Eruptions of \nanti-Western sentiment, triggered by events such as the burning of \nKorans by U.S. troops or the crude anti-Islam film that drew a \nviolent response across the Muslim world, are beginning to have a \ndepressingly familiar feel: Oh. Again.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom one day to the next, it's easy to lose track of the war's \ncumulative toll. Last week, scrolling through my cellphone directory, \nI realized how many of those listed in it had died violently: a \nmayor, two governors, a general, a women's activist, a professor, a \npolice chief, the president's half-brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a foreigner, I felt shielded from many of the dangers that \nordinary Afghans face in their daily lives. The war's violence killed \nor maimed more than 3,000 of them last year. The occasional close \ncall was a reminder of that: Once, as I was riding in a car in \ndowntown Kabul, a bomb went off about three blocks away. We felt the \npercussive thwump; the car shuddered hard once, like a dog shaking \nitself. I could see the driver's hands trembling on the wheel as we, \nlike everyone else, did a hard U-turn and drove off. Fast.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American troop buildup came and went, and this was the year in \nwhich the U.S. dead in this war surpassed the 2,000 mark. Thousands \nmore are maimed in ways that will mark them and our society for \ndecades to come. When I was with troops in the field, I was always \nstruck by how many of them cited the Sept. 11 attacks as their reason \nfor enlisting. I'd ask them: How old were you then? And they'd say: \nEleven, ma'am. Or maybe: Nine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the conflict's end-days at hand, prognostication is a common \nKabul pastime. Some predictions are dire: civil war, political \ncollapse, the return of the Taliban to power. Others are more \nhopeful: that the country will find a way forward, if haltingly and \npainfully.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not even trying to guess; if my time here has taught me anything, \nit's what I don't know about Afghanistan. This is a place where any \npresumption of understanding is routinely upended, sometimes \nhumorously, sometimes brutally. It can be as gentle as a birdlike \n\"chk-chk\" sound when you are pressing some respected tribal elder too \nhard on a delicate question, or a warning, issued in a rapid harsh \nwhisper, to leave some provincial town  right now, quickly and \nbefore dark  because your host cannot guarantee your safety.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong so many unknowables, I do know this: It is mainly the faces of \nthe Afghan women and girls that will stay with me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was the little girl, a ragged sprite I'd sometimes see when I \nwent to the headquarters of the NATO force for an interview or a news \nconference. She was part of a gaggle of street kids who sold matches \nor trinkets to passing foreigners; I remembered her because she stood \nout from the boy gang, and because she was so small, with such a \nbright and curious smile.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't until after the bombing that killed her and five of her \nfriends last month that I learned her name: Parwana. Butterfly, in \nDari. She was 8 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was Rahmaniya, an improbably stylish and articulate 18-year-old \nstudent from Kandahar who wanted nothing more than to keep learning. \nBut her brother was threatening to kill her if she continued her \nstudies. A sympathetic school principal was trying to help her find \nrefuge in another city, but she could not bear the idea of leaving \nher mother and sisters. \"I would kill myself if it weren't a sin,\" \nshe said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a woman named Humaira, whose face was so disarranged by \nrepeated beatings from her husband that it resembled a Cubist \npainting. I met her in a women's shelter in Kabul, where she was \ntrying to learn a skill  needlework  so she could support herself. \nShe smiled as she showed me her pinpricked fingertips, a badge of her \ndreams of independence. But a woman living on her own is almost \nunheard of, and eventually she went back to her abuser.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's not to say there aren't success stories; in spite of the odds, \nmany women here build remarkable lives for themselves and their \nfamilies. Parliament member Fawzia Koofi, seen by many as a possible \npresidential contender, clawed her way out of a desperately \nimpoverished childhood, the 19th of a family of 23 children. Repeated \nassassination attempts and death threats have failed to drive her \nfrom public life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut most of the educated Afghans I know, men and women alike, are \nintently focused these days on contingency planning. The luckiest \namong them have foreign passports and foreign bank accounts, and in \nthe last year, more acquaintances than ever before have approached me \nto plead for help in getting a U.S. visa.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaving, or trying to, is not a decision anyone takes lightly; love \nof homeland is a signature Afghan trait. This flight, though, spells \na rapidly depleting pool of precisely the kind of people whose skills \nand talents are the most sorely needed at this perilous juncture.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think every outsider who spends time in Afghanistan comes away \nchanged. You witness things that frighten you, sadden you, infuriate \nyou, surprise you  and you bear them all away like a skein of \ntangled thread, to be unknotted slowly, later. Back in the \"normal\" \nworld, its ordinary comforts  home, family, physical safety  have \nthe feel of something extraordinary. But mundane problems can also be \noddly confounding, a puzzle you've forgotten how to solve.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not my country, and it never was. But there was much about it I \ncame to love. Over the last few weeks, as I told people  Westerners \nand Afghans  that I was leaving, I'd often get the same response: \n\"Oh, you'll miss Afghanistan!\" It was usually meant sarcastically, as \nin, \"Look at this place! Who'd miss it?\"\u0014\nBut I will.\u0014\nlaura.king@latimes.com\u0014\nCopyright  2012, Los Angeles Times\u0014",

    "words": "Study: Fathers Greatly Affect Teens' Sexual Behavior\u0014\n\u0014\nA new review of studies shows fathers' attitudes toward teen sex and \nthe emotional closeness of their relationships with their teens have \na sizeable influence on their teens' sexual behaviors, separate from \nthe influence of moms, Yahoo! News reports. The review showed that \ndads' attitudes toward teen sexual behavior were linked to the age at \nwhich teens first had sex. Teens whose dads approved of adolescent \nsexual activity tended to start having sex earlier than teens whose \ndads did not approve, according to studies in the review. In \naddition, teens who were close to their fathers tended to start \nhaving sex later. According to study researcher Vincent \nGuilamo-Ramos, a professor of social work at New York University, the \nfindings \"suggest that fathers may distinctly influence the sexual \nbehavior of their adolescent children. Fathers may parent in ways \nthat differ from mothers, and therefore represent an additional \nopportunity to support adolescent health and well-being.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPublication date: October 22, 2012\u0014",

White, later confessed to killing the \nwoman to fulfill a fantasy of necrophilia, police said Friday. White \ndrank four or five beers before going to the woman's mobile home and \nrepeatedly striking her head with a mallet and strangling her with a \nzip tie, according to court documents.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said he stripped her dead body but does not remember if he carried \nout his sexual fantasy. After dumping her body, White returned to the \nmobile home and dressed her 3-year-old son in his Halloween costume, \nthen later Wednesday morning ferried him to a store parking lot to be \npicked up by the boy's father.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He kept saying he's a bad person, he's a pastor, he felt bad for the \npeople in his church. ... I don't recall him bring real remorseful at \nall with regard to the victim or anything else,\" Isabella County \nSheriff Leo Mioduszewski told The Associated Press.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He just basically said he was attracted to her, thought she was a \nvery cute girl. It's a crazy, tragic situation,\" the sheriff added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case shocked the pastor's roughly 14-member congregation and \nraised questions about how a man who had found religion after a \ncriminal past could return to his dark past.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhite was in jail without bond Friday, a day after he was charged \nwith first-degree murder in Rebekah Gay's death in a rural area in \nIsabella County, 85 miles northwest of Lansing. The 55-year-old has \nasked for a court-appointed attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhite was engaged to Gay's mother and regularly watched her young son \nwhile she worked, said Donna Houghton, a church elder who had a role \nin hiring White three years ago to be pastor at Christ Community \nFellowship. Church members, she said, were \"absolutely floored\" by \nthe allegations.\u0014",

    "words": "In 1960 McDonald's operated 200 restaurants. By 2012 they had 31,000 \nrestaurants. In 2012 there were more than a quarter-million fast-food \nrestaurants in America, and on any given day one in four Americans \nwill eat at least one meal at a fast-food restaurant. For many people \naround the world fast-food symbolizes speed, efficiency, and \nconvenience.\u0014\n\u0014\nSanford DeVoe, a researcher at the University of Toronto, wanted to \nexplore if our \"fast-food culture\" was changing our lives in ways \nbeyond just our eating habits. So DeVoe and another colleague \nconducted a series of experiments in which researchers subliminally \nflashed corporate logos for McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Burger King, \nSubway, and Wendy's. A control group saw other images but no \nfast-food logos. When the two groups were asked to do an unrelated \ntask, the fast-food group tried to complete it much faster than the \nnon-fast-food group. In another experiment, flashes of fast-food \nimages made students less able to sit back and enjoy music. A third \nexperiment found that people exposed to fast-food logos showed a \ngreater reluctance for saving.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on these experiments, DeVoe has concluded that fast food helps \nus save time, but even just thinking about fast food restaurants make \nus live with more speed and less patience. DeVoe said, \"Fast food \nculture  doesn't just change the way we eat but it can also \nfundamentally alter the way we experience our time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDeVoe claims that the impatience promoted by our fast-food culture \nand mindset \"stops us from smelling the roses.\u0014",

    "words": "Four men sue New Jersey organization over 'gay conversion therapy'\u0014\n\u0014\nBy James Eng, NBC News\u0014\n\u0014\nFour young men who say they underwent therapy that sought to \nconvert them from gay to straight are suing a New Jersey provider \nknown as JONAH, alleging fraud and accusing it of using dangerous \nsham tactics to try to fix something that isnt broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center on Tuesday filed the lawsuit in \nSuperior Court of New Jersey on behalf of the men and two of their \nparents against Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH), \nits founder, Arthur Goldberg, and counselor Alan Downing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawsuit alleges the defendants violated New Jerseys Consumer \nFraud Act by providing conversion therapy that falsely claims to \ncure gay clients.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the first time a conversion therapy provider has been sued \nfor fraudulent business practices, according to the SPLC, a \nMontgomery, Ala.-based civil rights organization that fights hate and \nbigotry.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSuing are Michael Ferguson, 30, of Salt Lake City; Benjamin Unger, \n25, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chaim Levin, 23, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; and \nSheldon Bruck, 20, of New York City, along with Levins mother, Bella \nLevin, and Brucks mother, Jo Bruck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawsuit says clients of JONAHs services typically paid a minimum \nof $100 for weekly individual counseling sessions and another $60 for \ngroup therapy sessions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFerguson was in his 20s and Unger, Levin and Bruck were in their late \nteens when they underwent the therapy, according to the lawsuit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four men say they were lured into JONAHs services through \ndeceptive practices and then subjected to humiliating and emotionally \ndamaging therapy techniques, including group sessions in which they \nwere instructed to stand naked in a circle with their counselor, who \nwas also undressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nJONAH profits off of shameful and dangerous attempts to fix \nsomething that isnt broken, Christine P. Sun, deputy legal director \nfor the SPLC, said in a statement. Despite the consensus of \nmainstream professional organizations that conversion therapy doesnt \nwork, this racket continues to scam vulnerable gay men and lesbians \nout of thousands of dollars and inflicts significant harm on them.\u0014\n\u0014\nJONAH, based in Jersey City, did not respond to telephone messages \nand emails from NBC News for comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages as well as revocation of \nJONAHs business license and an order to stop its employees and \nassociates from continuing reparative therapy practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the lawsuit, Ferguson said he participated in one session in which \nclients took turns trying break past a human chain to wrest away two \noranges, which were used to represent testicles, from another \nindividual  all the while being taunted with statements such as \nyoure such a fag, homo, queer boy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey play blindly with deep emotions and create an immense amount of \nself-doubt for the client, Ferguson was quoted as saying in a press \nrelease from the SPLC. They seize on your personal vulnerability, \nand tell you that being gay is synonymous with being less of a man. \nThey further misrepresent themselves as having the key to your new \norientation.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnger said his counselor advised him to spend more time at the gym as \nwell as to get naked with his father at bathhouses to get in touch \nwith his masculinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese counselors are skilled at manipulating you into believing just \nabout anything, said Unger. During my time with JONAH, they told me \nconstantly that my mom had made me gay. I was so convinced that I \nrefused to have any contact with her for several months, which caused \na great deal of damage to our relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another exercise, according to the lawsuit, clients were \nblindfolded in sporting scenes as counselors and others dribbled \nbasketballs and hurled anti-gay slurs at them.\u0014\n\u0014\nJONAH, formerly known as Jews Offering New Alternatives for \nHomosexuality, was founded by Goldberg, a former Wall Street \nexecutive and attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe organization describes itself as a non-profit international \norganization dedicated to educating the worldwide Jewish community \nabout the social, cultural and emotional factors which lead to \nsame-sex attractions.\u0014",

    "words": "Five Out-of-Fashion Dog Breeds This Vet Misses\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Dr. Marty Becker | November 15, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nThe popularity of a dog breed can change faster than you can say Yo \nquiero Taco Bell. One day Chihuahuas are feisty, fun little dogs \nyoud see only occasionally; the next day (or so it seems), you have \nthree of them back-to-back on your appointment calendar, and your \nlocal shelter is running a special on Chihuahua adoptions because \nthere are so many looking for homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nI see a lot of Chihuahuas over the exam room table these days, along \nwith Labradoodles, Pit Bulls, Bulldogs and the eternally popular \nLabrador Retriever. I love them all, but I have to admit I do miss \nseeing some of the dogs who used to be in my waiting room, pets I \nrarely see now that theyve lost the cache they once enjoyed.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive Breeds That Used to Be More Popular\u0014\n\u0014\nHeres my list of five dog breeds I used to see a lot of, and miss \nseeing now.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrish Setters: I used to see a lot of these bouncy red dogs in my \npractice. I know the rub is that theyre too energetic and not the \nbrightest bulb on the light string, but the ones I used to know were \ngreat family dogs who loved to be around people and really wanted to \nplease. I miss their smiling faces and the feathered tails that never \nstop wagging.\u0014\n\u0014\nScottish Terriers: These stylish, strong-minded dogs can be difficult \nto handle, since they are terriers through and through. In my family \nweve loved a lot of terriers, including our forever-missed \nWire-Haired Fox Terrier, Scooter, so I understand some of the \nchallenges. These days Im more likely to see a Scottie on a Monopoly \nboard than on an exam table. Too bad, because these high-style pups \nreally know how to make an entrance.\u0014\n\u0014\nCollies: When Lassie is in, so are Collies. Otherwise, their size and \nthe challenges of their massive, beautiful coat no doubt put many \npeople off. And thats a shame, because a good Collie, while not \nlikely to be saving Timmy from the well every day, is a great family \ndog  smart, loving and always keeping an eye on his flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrittanys: I suspect that as hunting has become less common as a \nsport, the breeds so closely associated with the pursuit have fallen \nout favor. And thats unfortunate, because the Brittany is a dog that \ncan do more than just hunt. The Brittany's compact size makes him a \ngood match for an active family, and he's a natural at modern-day \ncanine sporting events such as agility.\u0014\n\u0014\nCocker Spaniels: These little bird dogs were top of the heap for \ndecades, the most sought-after of all purebred dogs. Their reign at \nthe top of the American Kennel Club rankings finally ended with a \nwave of Poodles. I still see a fair number of Poodles  and even more \nPoodle-oodle mixes  but Cockers are relatively rare. And thats a \nshame, because like the Irish Setter, these dogs are sweet, beautiful \nand full of fun.\u0014\n\u0014\nMake no mistake: I love all the dogs  and cats  I see whether on \nthe street or over the exam room table, and I live to help them all \nbe healthier and happier. But I do miss some of the dogs who used to \nbe so popular. I know, however, that theyre only one hit TV show, \nmovie or commercial away from being popular again.\u0014",

One \nwas the pastor of a large and prestigious church. He was less than a \nyear from retirement and so prone to looking backward rather than \nforward. He gave some advice to those of us who were young and \nlooking forward. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou young fellas need to trust the bishop and the cabinet, he said. \nThey'll do right by you.

That, of course, was because he didn't mean what he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to the false modesty to which all men, and women, of the \ncloth are prone, he was just saying, I accept my past. His was not \na rational, truth-in-a-scientific-way statement. He wasn't doing \narithmetic; he was doing forgiveness. He was forgiving the bishop and \nthe cabinet and his congregations and himself for all that was past. \nHe thought he had to deny the facts of reality to make things come \nout okay.\u0014\n\u0014\nRather than the usual mantra of forgive and forget, I suggest that \nit is better to forgive and remember.

Your family may respect your work ethic, but they'd \nstill rather have time with youdays when you don't answer the phone \nwhenever it rings, vacations when you don't head back early so you \ndon't miss a service. Create and protect personal time when you are \nnot \"on call.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Ignoring Your Health\u0014\n\u0014\nRelated to Number Two, you must not neglect your own healthphysical, \nmental, and spiritual. Your gift to the key people in your life is a \nhealthy you. Find a buddy or accountability partner and begin to do \none thing that will help you be a healthier person this time next \nyear. Do you need to exercise more? Start seeing a counselor? \nRekindle a hobby you enjoy? Worship in a place where no one calls you \n\"pastor\"?\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Surrounding Yourself with People who Think Just Like You\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you're able to click \"like\" on everything your Facebook friends \nsay, you may have unintentionally created an echo chamber in which \nyou are so surrounded by like-minded people, you begin to think your \nway of thinking is the norm or the majority view. Practice listening \nto people different from you, and you'll have a better appreciation \nfor how other people understand God and the world. You might not \nchange your mind about anything, but your preaching and teaching will \nbe richer from hearing other people's perspectives, struggles, and \ndoubts.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Being a Broken Record\u0014\n\u0014\nStop rehashing your favorite scripture, topic, or theological view. \nLook closely at your sermons and the Bible studies you've taught over \nthe past year. Have you gravitated to a particular book of the Bible \nor does your favorite scripture seem to weave itself into everything \nyou say? Of course you want to emphasize the core values of our \nfaith, and key fundamentals bear repeating, but challenge yourself to \ntackle a topic you've never explored in depth, or a Scripture that \nmakes you uncomfortable. Take an online class, get a new reference \ntool, contact a chum from seminary or Bible college and plan a way to \nstudy together. Stretch yourself, not just for your own sake, but for \nthe benefit of everyone you lead.\u0014",

    "words": "February 11, 2013    New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nFarewell to an Uninspiring Pope\u0014\n\u0014\nBy JOHN PATRICK SHANLEY\u0014\n\u0014\nPOPE BENEDICT XVI quit. Good. He was utterly bereft of charm, \ntone-deaf and a protector of priests who abused children. Hed been a \nmember of the Hitler Youth. In addition to this woeful rsum, he had \nno use for women. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Catholic Church, which in so many ways has been a great \nboon to the City of New York, has been choked and bludgeoned into \ninsignificance by a small group of men based in Italy. \u0014\n\u0014\nPriests cannot marry. Why? I will tell you why. Priests cannot marry \nbecause they would have to marry women. Women cannot be priests. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? Women cannot become priests because of a bunch of old men. These \nold men justify their beliefs with a brace of ridiculous arguments \nthat Jesus would have overturned in a minute. Do unto others as you \nwould have them do to you. What about that is hard to understand? If \nyou can become a priest, I can become a priest. Period. Equality. \u0014\n\u0014\nBenedict has not been idle. He has put in place a lot of other old \nguys who have no interest in sharing power with anyone outside the \nclub. The last pope we had who showed signs of spiritual vision was \nJohn XXIII. That was a long time ago. He had humility and a good \nheart. These more recent appointments have been disheartening in the \nextreme. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a kid at St. Anthonys in the Bronx (one of the schools \nthat the archdiocese of New York is now closing), there were boxes \nfor the poor. The people of the East Bronx worked hard and made \nlittle. Everybody put money in those boxes. I put money in those \nboxes. As far as Im concerned, that money was stolen. \u0014\n\u0014\nI have watched the wealth of the Catholic Church turned into a \nsubsidy for wrongdoing and a prop for the continuing campaign against \nwomens rights and homosexuality. Neighborhood churches, built with \nthe hard-earned money of working-class people, are being sold off. \nThe sacrifices that were made to build these churches were \nsignificant and local. The decision to close them has been made \nantiseptically, by remote control. The men who make these decisions \nare at a remove, very much involved in protecting their power and \ncomfort. \u0014\n\u0014\nI have little reason to hope that the Church of Rome will suddenly \nrealize that without women, the Catholic Church is doomed, and should \nbe doomed. I think of those good nuns who educated me, of their \nlifelong devotion and sacrifice. They have been treated like cattle \nby a crowd of domineering fools. In Benedict, the Catholic Church got \nthe pope it deserved. I can only hope, for the sake of my parents, \nwho loved the church so much, that a miracle of divine grace alters \nthe writing on the wall. If not, the Catholic Church will suffer the \nfate it deserves. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Patrick Shanley is the author of Doubt and other plays.\u0014",

    "title": "FERDINAND AND ISABELLA EDICT AGAINST JEWS",
    "words": "Ferdinand and Isabella's Edict Against Jews\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year 1492 is most often associated with Columbus and his \ndiscovery of America. But another event of tragic proportions \ndeveloped that year. It gave the world the Sephardic Jews (so called \nbecause Sepharadh was a region of Spain where many Jews had settled).\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1492, Spain, under Ferdinand and Isabella had just emerged as a \ndefender of the Roman Catholic faith. The marriage of the two rulers \neventually united Aragon and Castile, although while she lived, \nIsabella did not yield her authority to her husband. In Granada, the \npair defeated the Islamic Moors, who had long controlled Spain. \nSpurred on by the cruel Grand Inquisitor Torquemada, Ferdinand and \nIsabella felt they must remove all heretics and non-Christians from \ntheir land in order to purge it of pagan influences and firmly \nestablish the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fires of the Inquisition had already roared in Spain for twelve \nlong years. The Inquisition's primary purpose was not to deal with \nJews and Muslims. Any person who professed Christianity and then \nreturned to his or her ancestral faith was tried and punished. In \neight years, the tribunal of Seville alone put 700 persons to death \nand condemned 5,000 others to life in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what about those Jews who never adopted Christianity? Their \nmajesties had a plan for them, too. On this day, March 31, 1492, in \nthe city of Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella signed an edict banishing \nfrom the Kingdoms of Aragon and Castile all Jews unwilling to receive \nbaptism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You know well or ought to know, that whereas we have been informed \nthat in these our kingdoms there were some wicked Christians who \nJudaized and apostatized from our holy Catholic faith, the great \ncause of which was interaction between the Jews and these \nChristians...we ordered the separation of the said Jews in all the \ncities, towns and villages of our kingdoms and lordships and \n[commanded] that they be given Jewish quarters and separate places \nwhere they should live, hoping that by their separation the situation \nwould remedy itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeparation not having worked, the monarchs gave the Jews until July \n31st to sell their goods and leave the country. They were forbidden \nto carry gold or silver out of the kingdom. Worse, although signed in \nMarch, the edict was not publicly announced until the end of April, \nso the Jews actually had only three months to convert their property \nto trade goods. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christians\" took advantage of the situation and paid ridiculously \nlow prices for Jewish possessions -- a donkey bought a house; a piece \nof cloth or linen purchased an entire vineyard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July 1492, the exodus began. When Columbus left on his famous \nvoyage in August, he could not use the port of Cadiz because of the \nlarge numbers of Jews waiting to board ships in the harbor. Many Jews \nof Castile went to Portugal, where they were forced to pay a ransom \nto remain. Others went to Italy or the northern coast of Africa. \nWherever they went, they were robbed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpain's economy paid for its mistreatment of the Jews: many had been \nskilled craftsmen. Sultan Bajazet of Turkey warmly welcomed those who \nescaped to his country. \"How can you call Ferdinand of Aragon a wise \nking--the same Ferdinand who impoverished his own land and enriched \nours?\" he asked. He employed the Jew in making weapons to fight \nagainst Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\n\"Ferdinand V, King of Castile.\" Encyclopedia Americana.Chicago: \nAmericana Corp., 1956.\u0014\n\"Jewish History Sourcebook: The Expulsion from Spain, 1492 CE.\"The \nMedieval Sourcebook.\u0014\n\"Spanish Expulsion, 1492.\" http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ \njsource/Judaism/expulsion.html\u0014",

    "words": "In 1911, Roald Amundsen became the first person to lead a successful \nexpedition to the South Pole. Amundsen was also famous for his \nincredible commitment to prepare for this expedition. While in his \nlate twenties, Roald Amundsen traveled from Norway to Spain for a \ntwo-month sailing trip to earn a master's certificate. It was 1899. \nHe had a nearly two-thousand-mile journey ahead of him. And how did \nAmundsen make the journey? By carriage? By horse? By ship? By rail? \nHe bicycled.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmundsen then experimented with eating raw dolphin meat to determine \nits usefulness as an energy supply. After all, he reasoned, someday \nhe might be shipwrecked, finding himself surrounded by dolphins, so \nhe might as well know if he could eat one.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was all part of Amundsen's years of building a foundation for his \nquest, training his body and learning as much as possible from \npractical experience about what actually worked. Amundsen even made a \npilgrimage to apprentice with Eskimos. What better way to learn what \nworked in polar conditions than to spend time with a people who have \nhundreds of years of accumulated experience in ice and cold and snow \nand wind? He learned how Eskimos used dogs to pull sleds. He observed \nhow Eskimos never hurried, moving slowly and steadily, avoiding \nexcessive sweat that could turn to ice in sub-zero temperatures. He \nadopted Eskimo clothing, loose fitting (to help sweat evaporate) and \nprotective. He systematically practiced Eskimo methods and trained \nhimself for every conceivable situation he might encounter en route \nto the Pole.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmundsen's philosophy: You don't wait until you're in an unexpected \nstorm to discover that you need more strength and endurance. You \ndon't wait until you're shipwrecked to determine if you can eat raw \ndolphin. You don't wait until you're on the Antarctic journey to \nbecome a superb skier and dog handler. You prepare with intensity, \nall the time, so that when conditions turn against you, you can draw \nfrom a deep reservoir of strength. And equally, you prepare so that \nwhen conditions turn in your favor, you can strike hard.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Collins and Morten T.

A young man had to be operated on without anesthetic by \nuntrained personnel, using a penknife and flashlight, obeying \ninstructions relayed by morse code on radios provided by an \nAustralian mission. The operation lasted seven hours.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the agony was in vain. Within a month, the man died of \ncomplications from his unidentified surgery just hours before a \ntrained doctor arrived.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man who set himself to do something about that was John Flynn. \n\"If it is true that Jesus is God's Son, and that through Him \nwhosoever will may approach the Father Himself, what more honorable \ncalling can a man follow than to realize this fact and act upon it?\" \nWith those words, Flynn convinced himself that God meant for him to \nbecome a minister.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1880, at Moliagul in Victoria, Australia, John got his faith \nfrom his father, a lay pastor in the Methodist church and a school \nteacher. His mother had died when he was three. A year after her \ndeath, John's father transferred to a school near Melbourne. The \nnearest church was Presbyterian and so John became a Presbyterian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAustralia's Outback intrigued him. Looking across it he saw the same \nthings anyone else saw. He saw dust and deadly isolation. He saw \nregrettable deaths that could have been prevented--would have been if \nthere had been medical care. He saw souls untutored in the rudiments \nof faith and minds stunted for lack of schooling. He saw all that. \nBut he saw more.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe dreamed of railroads and radio stations. He imagined a network of \nnursing centers, close enough to every bush station to give a real \nchance of life after an accident. He conceived a line of roving \nparsons and wondered why children could not be taught with \ncorrespondence courses. Above all, after the invention of the \nairplane, he envisioned air ambulances to rush doctors to urgent \ncases or critical patient to medical centers.

    "words": "Can we be full of forgiveness, even to those most wicked wrong-doers?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most talked about books in the realm of psychology in \nrecent years is Beverly Flanigan's Forgiving the Unforgivable (New \nYork: Macmillan, 1992). How can we come to love our enemies? How do \nwe forgive those who have persecuted, molested, raped, threatened, \nabandoned, betrayed, dominated us? How can we find forgiveness for \nthose loved ones who have hurt and abused us? The harms of lovers and \nspouses, the harms of mothers and fathers, the harms of friends and \ncoworkers, and the harms of children cause special damage to the \nspirit and create unforgivable injuries and unforgivable harms that, \nif they remain unforgiven, will destroy the unforgiver.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlanigan presents a transactional model of forgiveness that is \ndirectly opposite the solitary forgiving so prevalent in and \nreflective of contemporary life. We tend to forgive alone, with no \nhelp from others, because we live in competitive and independent \nrelationships from others. For the first time in history, people do \nnot need each other to assure their survival. Children can leave \nparents, husbands can abandon wives, and friends need never speak to \none another again. American life has made it possible for people to \nquickly sever their most intimate relationships and to leave behind \nthose closest to them after one has hurt the other. We are a mobile \nsociety. We are prideful and competitive. We dislike losers. Many of \nus believe that forgivers are wimps or that people who stick around \nto help someone they have hurt pick up the pieces are fools. The \ntransaction of forgiving is impossible when one party is unwilling or \nunavailable to talk to the other (6-7).\u0014",

When dads aren't \naround, young people are more likely to drop out of school, use \ndrugs, be involved in the criminal justice system, and become young \nparents themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvolved fathers provide practical support in raising children and \nserve as models for their development. Children with involved, loving \nfathers are significantly more likely to do well in school, have \nhealthy self-esteem, exhibit empathy and pro-social behavior compared \nto children who have uninvolved fathers. Committed and responsible \nfathering during infancy and early childhood contributes emotional \nsecurity, curiosity, and math and verbal skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur social well-being depends on it. Our children need responsible, \nengaged fathers.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo many fathers are missing from childrearing, child protecting, \nchild providing. Children reared in households without a father or \nchildren born out of wedlock face enormous, even crippling, \nchallenges.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Researchers have consistently found that children born outside \nmarriage face elevated risks of falling into poverty, failing in \nschool or suffering emotional and behavioral problems,\" reported the \nNew York Times.\u0014\n\u0014\nA fall 2010 Brookings report began: \"The rise of fragile families  \nfamilies that begin when a child is born outside of marriage  is one \nof the nation's most vexing social problems.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the first place, these families suffer high poverty rates and \npoor child outcomes,\" said the report. \"Even more problematic, the \nvery groups of Americans who traditionally experience poverty, \nimpaired child development, and poor school achievement have the \nhighest rates of nonmarital parenthood  thus intensifying the \ndisadvantages faced by these families and extending them into the \nnext generation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Brookings Institution is a nonprofit think tank engaged in \nresearch and public policy concerns.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report, \"Strengthening Fragile Families,\" noted, \"Today more than \n70 percent of black children, 50 percent of Hispanic children, nearly \n30 percent of white children, and 40 percent of all children are born \noutside marriage, assuring the persistence of poverty, wasting human \npotential, and raising government spending. Reducing nonmarital \nbirths and mitigating their consequences should be a top priority of \nthe nation's social policy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Obama has commendably sought to draw attention to \nfatherlessness, often with references to his own story.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I grew up without my father around. He left when I was 2 years old \n... I felt his absence. And I wonder what my life would have been \nlike had he been a greater presence,\" he said in his weekly address \non Father's Day weekend 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"More and more kids grow up without a father figure,\" he said, before \nadding, \"Every father has a personal responsibility to do right by \nour kids as well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 2012 Father's Day proclamation, Obama said, \"Every father \nbears a fundamental obligation to do right by their children. Yet, \ntoday, too many young Americans grow up without the love and support \nof their fathers. When the responsibilities of fathers go unmet, our \ncommunities suffer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking at the 2013 graduation ceremonies at the all-male Morehouse \nCollege, Obama said, \"Be the best father you can be to your children. \nBecause nothing is more important.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNoting his own childhood without his biological father, he said, \"I \nsure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved. \nDidn't know my dad. And so my whole life, I've tried to be for \nMichelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me.

Not \nsurprisingly, the study found that kids generally spend increasing \namounts of one-on-one time with their parents in the early years of \nadolescence. But time with mom and dad starts to drop when the \nteenager hits about the age of 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the longitudinal study also found at least one surprising \nresult: teens still need time with dad. One of the researchers put it \nthis way:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stereotype that teenagers spend all their time holed up in their \nrooms or hanging out with friends is  just a stereotype. Our \nresearch shows that well into the adolescent years, teens continue to \nspend time with their parents and that this shared time, especially \nshared time with fathers has important implications for adolescents' \n adjustment.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore specifically, the study noted that, generally speaking, the more \ntime teens spend with their dads, the higher their self-esteem. Also, \nthe more time teens spend with their dads in a group setting, the \nbetter their social skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnn Crouter, Dean of Health and Human Development at Penn State, says \nthat teens with involved fathers \"may develop higher general \nself-worth because their fathers go beyond social expectations to \ndevote undivided attention to them.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Finding Our Lost Boys\u0014\n\u0014\nUp to 90 percent of boys will leave the church. What can a \ncongregation do? \u0014\n\u0014\nTim Wright \u0014\n\u0014\nThe church today faces one of the greatest challenges in Christian \nhistory: the mass exodus of boys (and men) from the church. Seventy \nto ninety percent of all boys will leave the church. Most won't come \nback. That exit is part of a larger cultural story about our boys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, many parents and educators grew \nincreasingly frustrated with the gap between boys and girls in \nschool. Boys excelled in almost every area over girls. Because more \nboys attended college than girls, it gave them an advantage over \nwomen in the workplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to that crisis, the U.S. Government invested over 100 \nmillion dollars to give girls equal opportunities and extra attention \nin schools. In the span of a generation, concerned parents, \neducators, and the government collectively changed the storyline of \ngirls (and women) in our culture. Though there's still work to be \ndone, a tremendous amount has been accomplished. Girls and women have \nexcelled in areas of life once seen as the exclusive domain of men. \nAs the father of a focused, career-minded, want-to-change-the-world \ndaughter who has a master's degree from London and a law degree from \nthe University of Minnesota, I'm grateful for that change!\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now we face a different challenge. Our boys have been left in the \ndust. They now lag significantly behind girls in many areas of \neducation, economics, and career. Many boys have no clear idea of \nwhat it means to be a man in this new world of equality. While we are \nable to tell girls a better story about themselves, now it's the guys \nwho are confused about their place in the world. The result is that \nwe're raising a generation of \"lost boys,\" many of whom have no idea \nwhat it means to be a man in the church or in culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe quest for boys\u0014\n\u0014\nI have two children: my firstborn, a daughter, and my second, a son. \nI am also a grandfather of a granddaughter and two grandsons (so \nfar). I have some experience raising both boys and girls. In raising \nmy two children, I recognized their differences not only as a female \nand a male but also as two unique personalities. It wasn't until \nrecently, however, that I began to understand and appreciate the \ninherent differences between the sexes. Looking beyond the \negalitarian/complementarian conversation (so loaded these days), \nthere are real differences apparent in childrearingof hormones, \ninterests, and views of the world. Boys and girls are different.\u0014",

He \nstarted cutting his own hair at the age of nine. He even refused to \nenter a barber shop. \u0014\n\u0014\nMegan Fox hates paper. Megan says it's not a full phobia, it's more \nlike the people who get chills from fingernails scratching on a \nblackboard. Megan says she has to have a paper cup around to \nimmediately wet her fingers to turn the pages if she is reading a \nscript or a book. She hates dry paper. \u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew McConaughey is scared of revolving doors. He will not get \nanywhere near a revolving door. He's also afraid of tunnels. He's not \nscared of being in a tunnel, but he is scared of the point where you \nhave to enter a tunnel.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnny Depp is terrified of clowns. Says Johnny, \"There's something \nabout the painted face, the fake smile. There always seems to be a \ndarkness lurking under the surface, a potential for real evil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNicole Kidman is afraid of butterflies. Once, bravely, she tried \nwalking through a butterfly exhibit at a museum, but couldn't make \nit. As a young girl, Nicole wouldn't even enter her home if a \nbutterfly was sitting on the entrance gate.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristina Ricci can't stand to be around houseplants. She is also \ndeathly afraid of being in a swimming pool alone. She always imagines \n\"a magic door is going to open and a shark is going to come out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Bob Thornton is deathly afraid of antique furniture. He is not \ncomfortable being in a room with any furniture that goes back before \n1850. (It must have been hard to film The Alamo. Almost as tough as \nit was to watch that movie!)\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Moore (James Bond) -yes, agent 007 himself- cannot pick up a \ngun without uncontrollably blinking. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs. The director of Psycho just \nhated eggs, especially runny ones (who doesn't?).\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, irony of ironies, Walt Disney, who gave the world Mickey Mouse, \nwas indeed, afraid of mice. \u0014\n\u0014\nComposer Fredric Chopin and storyteller Hans Christian Andersen were \nboth very scared of being buried alive. Andersen always kept a sign \naround whenever he slept, which said he wasn't really dead, he just \nlooked that way, and that he really was sleeping. \u0014\n\u0014\nStage fright? Some of the greatest actors and performers in history \nhave been stricken with this phobia, including Marilyn Monroe, Barbra \nStreisand, Gracie Allen, and even Sir Lawrence Olivier. It is \nactually a tribute to these great talents that they were able to give \nsuch incredible performances under the circumstances. \u0014\nFear of water is Michael Jordan's Achille's heel. A childhood friend \nof his died in the ocean and his armed locked onto Michael's before \nMichael could wrest himself free. Ever since, the water scares \"Air\" \nJordan.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to legend, Stephen Spielberg is afraid of insects.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonald Trump has a phobia about shaking hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nWoody Allen was treated by psychoanalysts for 40 years (hmm, didn't \nseem to help much). \"I've been killing spiders since I was 30,\" says \nAllen about one of his legion of fears and phobias. He is also \ndeathly afraid of showering in a shower where the drain is in the \nmiddle of the tub. Woody's list of fears also includes stage fright, \nsunshine, children, hotel bathrooms, cancer and other diseases, \nheights, crowds, and small rooms. Woody also had claustrophobia and \nagorophobia. \u0014\n\u0014\nAilurophobia? What the heck is that one? Fear of cats, for some \nreason, was suffered by many of history's most dynamic leaders and \nconquerors, including Julius Caesar, Napolean Bonaparte, Alexander \nthe Great, and Benito Mussolini. \u0014\n\u0014\nFear of flying is a pretty common fear. Tony Curtis tried hypnosis to \ncure it. Even the great Elvis Presley fought off this one, but he did \nrefuse to fly early in his career. Muhammad Ali, Ronald Reagan, John \nMadden, Cher, Florence Henderson, Johnny Cash, and sci-fi writer Ray \nBradbury were also stricken with fear of flying. \u0014\n\u0014\nKeanu Reeves is afraid of being left alone in the dark. \u0014\n\u0014\nPamela Anderson is (ironically?) afraid of mirrors.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheryl Crow is scared of heights.\u0014\n\u0014\nOkay, let's end this inevitably \"endless\" list. Bela Lugosi, yes, \n\"Dracula\" himself, was afraid of blood!\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Billie Bob Thorton  Panophobia, fear of antique furniture\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe its a past-life thing and I got beat to death with some old \nchair, Thornton told Oprah Winfrey. I dont really know. But anyway \n Im totally serious. And I cant eat around antiques.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Alfred Hitchcock  Ovophobia, fear of eggs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile filming the Birds, actress Susan Pleshette was chatised by \nHitchcocks assistant. She said, Dont put your cigarette out in \nyour eggs,  Pleshette said. He hates eggs, he hates cigarettes, \nand frankly, he hates you. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. Natalie Wood  Aquaphobia, fear of water. She died by drowning.\u0014\n\u0014\nNatalies mother may have also caused her lifelong fear of water. It \nbegan when her mother lied to her about a bridge she had to cross in \na movie scene. She said it was safe, but the truth is, it was rigged \nto collapse.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. John Madden  Aerophobia, fear of flying\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Madden travels by bus for all of his job as a sports announcer.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Christina Ricci  Botanophobia, fear of indoor houseplants\u0014\n\u0014\nRicci swears shes afraid of houseplants. They are dirty, she said. \nIf I have to touch one, after already being repulsed by the fact \nthat there is a plant indoors, then it just freaks me out.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Madonna  Brontophobia, fear of thunder\u0014\n\u0014\nMany dogs share with Madonna an irrational fear of thunder.\u0014\n\u0014\n==============================\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fears of Famous People\u0014\n\u0014\nJennifer Aniston, Cher, and Whoopi Goldberg are all aviophobes. They \nare afraid of flying. Barbra Streisand is xenophobicshe is \nuncomfortable around strangers. Michael Jackson was haunted by the \nfear of contamination, infections, and diseases. He was mysophobic. \nBut the celebrity with the most phobias is Woody Allen. He's afraid \nof insects, sunshine, dogs, deer, bright colors, children, heights, \nsmall rooms, crowds, and cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamous people of the past were no different. George Washington was \nscared to death of being buried alive. Richard Nixon was terrified of \nhospitals, and Napoleon Bonaparte, the military and political genius, \nfeared cats.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Jeremiah, What Are You Afraid Of?

    "title": "FIGHTING A MCDONALD'S FOR RIGHT TO SIT AND SIT AND SIT",
    "words": "Fighting a McDonalds in Queens for the Right to Sit. And Sit. And \nSit.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy SARAH MASLIN NIR and JIHA HAMJAN. JANUARY 14, 2014 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after New Years Day, Man Hyung Lee, 77, was nursing a coffee \nin his usual seat in a narrow booth at a McDonalds in Flushing, \nQueens, when two police officers stepped into the fluorescent light \nof the restaurant.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Lee said the officers had been called because he and his friends \n a revolving group who shuffle into the McDonalds on the corner of \nParsons and Northern Boulevards on walkers, or with canes, in \nwheelchairs or with infirm steps, as early as 5 a.m. and often linger \nuntil well after dark  had, as they seem to do every day, long \noverstayed their welcome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey ordered us out, Mr. Lee said from his seat in the same \nMcDonalds booth a week after the incident, beneath a sign that said \ncustomers have 20 minutes to finish their food. (He had already been \nthere two hours.) So I left, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen I walked around the block and came right back again.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past several months, a number of elderly Korean patrons and \nthis McDonalds they frequent have been battling over the benches \ninside. The restaurant says the people who colonize the seats on a \ndaily basis are quashing business, taking up tables for hours while \nsplitting a small packet of French fries ($1.39); the group say they \nare customers and entitled to take their time. A lot of time.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you think you can drink a large coffee within 20 minutes? David \nChoi, 77, said. No, its impossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd though they have treated the corner restaurant as their own \npersonal meeting place for more than five years, they say, the \nsituation has escalated in recent months. The police said there had \nbeen four 911 calls since November requesting the removal of the \nentrenched older patrons. Officers have stopped in as frequently as \nthree times a day while on patrol, according to the patrons, who \nsidle away only to boomerang right back. Medium cups of coffee ($1.09 \neach) have been spilled; harsh words have been exchanged. And still  \nproud, defiant and stuck in their ways  they file in each morning, \nstaging a de facto sit-in amid the McNuggets.\u0014\n\u0014\nLarge group  males, females  refusing to get up and leave, read \nthe police summary of one 911 call placed on Jan. 3 at 2:30 p.m. The \ngroup passed a lot of sit-down time. Refusing to let other customers \nsit.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither a Burger King nor another McDonalds, both within a few \nblocks on Northern Boulevard, has the same allure.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorkers at the restaurant say they are exasperated.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a McDonalds, said Martha Anderson, the general manager, not \na senior center. She said she called the police after the group \nrefused to budge and other customers asked for refunds because there \nwas nowhere to sit.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter multiple requests for comment, a spokeswoman for McDonalds \nsaid the company would address the issue, but as of Tuesday evening \nit had not done so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police in the 109th Precinct, which serves the area, say that \ncalls to resolve to disputes at businesses are routine, though the \ndisruptions are more often caused by unruly teenagers than by \nseptuagenarians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Flushing McDonalds looks like any other. Few among the crowd \nthere on a recent Saturday said they even liked the food. We prefer \nour own Korean food, said Hoick Choi, 76, a pastor at New Power \nPresbyterian Church, who comes about once a week. Many come after \nfilling up on a free lunch at a nearby senior center.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome say it is convenience that draws them from the solitude of their \nnearby homes to spend the day sitting there in the Big Mac-scented \nair. Many are widowed, or like Jee Woong Lim, 81, who arrived in \nAmerica two years ago from Seoul, say they are in need of company. \nThey are almost without exception nattily dressed, in suits or dress \nslacks, brightly colored ties or sweaters, fedoras and well-shined \nshoes.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet there seem to be no shortage of facilities that cater to the \nelderly in the neighborhood. Civic centers dot the blocks, featuring \nparlors for baduk, an Asian board game, and classes in subjects from \ncalisthenics to English. Mr. Lee, who comes to the McDonalds from \nBayside, passes several senior centers en route. One is a Korean \nCommunity Service center in Flushing, which recently changed a room \nin the basement into a cafe with 25-cent coffee after its president, \nKwang S. Kim, got word of the McDonalds standoff.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one has come.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think I have to go to McDonalds and ask why theyre there, Mr. \nKim said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside the McDonalds on Saturday, Sang Yong Park, 76, and his \nfriend, Il Ho Park, 76, tried to explain what drew them there. They \ncome every single day to gossip, chat about politics back home and in \ntheir adopted land, hauling themselves up from the banquettes with \ntheir canes to step outside for short cigarillo breaks. And they \ncould not say why they keep coming back  after a short walk around \nthe block to blow off steam  every time the officers remove them. \nThey said they had each been ousted three times so far.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two men, however, knew what they would do next time. Sang Yong \nPark said he would not budge, but his friend said he would dutifully \nobey any police order, just as he always has. I will just listen to \nthem, he said. But I will come back inside after they leave.\u0014",

I believe in a higher power \nbigger than me because that keeps me accountable. Accountability is \nrare to find, especially with people like myself, because nobody \nwants to tell you something you dont want to hear.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm not Buddhist, Im not Hindu, Im not Christian, but I still feel \nlike I have a deep connection with God, Perry continued. I pray all \nthe timefor self-control, for humility. Theres a lot of gratitude \nin it. Just saying thank you sometimes is better than asking for \nthings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs previously reported, Perry, an evangelical ministers daughter, \nwas raised in California, and was brought up to avoid secular music \nand television programs. She began singing as a Contemporary \nChristian artist at age 15, and released her first national album in \n2001. In an interview with CCM (Contemporary Christian Music \nMagazine), she stated that one her musical influences was Keith \nGreen, who was known to be bold in his lyrical witness for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, in 2007, Perry signed with with the secular label Capitol \nRecords, and released her first single, I Kissed a Girl, a number one \nhit that talks about experimentation with lesbianism. The popularity \nof Perrys single brought continued national attention until she \nbecame one of the most well-known pop artists in the secular music \nindustry.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerrys parents, Keith and Mary Hudson, who lead Church on the Rise \nin Westlake, Ohio, state that they do not agree with all of the \nchoices that their daughter has made in her music career.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a book proposal by Perrys mother, which was shopped in 2011, Mary \nHudson reportedly outlined a number of concerns to set the record \nstraight about her feelings.\u0014\n\u0014\nI recognized the psalmist gift in her performance. Yet she sang out, \nI kissed a girl, and I liked it, while thousands joined her, she \nwrote. One part of my heart soared  [but] the other part broke for \nthe thousands of hungry souls being fed something that didnt nourish \ntheir spirit, but fed their flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerrys fathers comments were angled differently.\u0014\n\u0014\nI love my daughter and I will always love her. Stop being judgmental \nand critical, Keith Hudson stated. God has given us a platform to \ngo in and meet peopleand they like us because we are cool. We are \nnot threatening.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerry told Marie Claire that she acknowledges that her parents \ndisagree with some of her choices, but said that they maintain a \npositive relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople dont understand that I have a great relationship with my \nparents  like, how that can exist? she explained. There isnt any \njudgment. They dont necessarily agree with everything I do, but I \ndont necessarily agree with everything they do.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey pray for me is what they do, the singer continued. Theyre \nfascinated with the idea that they created someone who has this much \nattention on her.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2010, Perry admitted during an explicit interview with Rolling \nStone Magazine entitled Sex, God and Katy Perry that she had turned \naway from many of the things she had been taught by her parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nLetting go was a process, she stated. Meeting gay people or Jewish \npeople, and realizing that they were fine, was a big part of it. Once \nI stopped being chaperoned, and realized I had a choice in life, I \nwas like, Wow, there are a lot of choices. I began to become a \nsponge for all that I had missedthe music, the movies. I was as \ncurious as the cat.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod is very much still a part of my life, Perry asserted. But the \nway the details are told in the Biblethats very fuzzy for me. And I \nwant to throw up when I say that. But thats the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\n\t 2014 Microsoft\u0014",

    "words": "By Bob Allen  Asscoaited Baptiost Press  3/20/14\u0014\n\u0014\nFred Phelps, founding pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, \nKan., is dead at age 84, family members confirmed to local media.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhelps' son, Timothy, told Topeka television station WIBW that his \nfather died late Wednesday night. Daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper \nconfirmed the death at Midland Care Hospice to the Topeka \nCapital-Journal.\u0014\n\u0014\nReports circulated in recent days that Phelps, known around the world \nfor anti-gay protests by the small independent congregation he \nstarted in 1955, was dying. During that coverage, additional reports \nsurfaced that Phelps was recently voted out of membership after \ncalling for a kinder approach among church members as a male board of \nelders defeated his daughter in a power struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhelps, a disbarred lawyer who specialized in civil rights cases \nchallenging Jim Crow laws in the 1960s, was ordained as a Southern \nBaptist minister in 1947, but the church he started isn't affiliated \nwith any religious denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the churchs notoriety grew for its God Hates Fags \nanti-homosexuality slogan at public protests, however, leaders of \nreligious bodies as diverse as \\American Baptist Churches USA, \n\\Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Southern Baptist Convention \nall denounced the group as giving Baptists a bad name.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe congregation, comprised almost entirely of the patriarchs \nextended family, claims to have engaged in 52,335 pickets in 922 \ncities in what church members call their outreach ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe protests began with a 1991 demonstration at a Topeka park known \nto be frequented by gays. The group first gained national attention \nby appearing at the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a University of \nWyoming student whose 1998 murder prompted hate-crime legislation in \nmany states.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years the church remained relatively obscure picketing events \nlike religious conventions, including the Southern Baptist \nConvention, and performances of the The Laramie Project, a play based \non Shepards life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat changed in 2005 when church members started showing up at \nfunerals of fallen American soldiers proclaiming that casualties in \nIraq and Afghanistan are the result of Gods wrath against America \nfor tolerating homosexuality. A number of states responded with laws \nregulating protests near funerals.\u0014\n\u0014\nA BBC documentary in 2008 profiled the Phelps clan as The Most Hated \nFamily in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent months the church has gotten attention for defections. \nLauren Drain, kicked out for questioning church doctrine just before \nher 22nd birthday, told her story in a 2013 book titled Banished: \nSurviving My Years in the Westboro Baptist Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMegan Phelps-Roper, a Phelps granddaughter who handled the churchs \nsocial media, left Westboro at age 27 early in 2013, followed by her \n19-year-old sister, Grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nNate Phelps, estranged for years from his family since leaving his \nfathers church the night he turned 18, began speaking out on \nreligion and child abuse and as an LGBT advocate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWord of his impending death prompted speculation about whether \nPhelps own funeral might attract pickets, but church member Margie \nPhelps told the Huffington Post that memorials are not in line with \nthe churchs beliefs. We don't worship the dead in this church, so \nthere'd be no public memorial or funeral to picket if any member \ndied, she explained.\u0014",

    "title": "FAYE EDGERTON GAVE GOD'S WORD TO THE NAVAJO",
    "words": "The Navajo Indians gave Faye Edgerton a name: \"The One Who \nUnderstands.\" The reason was simple: she had spent close to half a \ncentury with them, learning their language (they called it Dine \nbizaad) and translating the New Testament into it. To the Indians it \nnow seemed as if God spoke Navajo! In fact, they challenged her when \nshe tried to revise it. How dare she change God's words!\u0014\n\u0014\nFaye Edgerton was born on this day, March 26, 1889. Her youth was one \nlong social whirl, although she did well in school and became a \ncompetent musician. She had sought God at a young age and even become \ninvolved in church work, but had never known Him as a presence in her \nlife. A bout with scarlet fever nearly killed her and left her \nvirtually deaf for several days. This forced her to acknowledge her \npurposeless ways. When her hearing returned, she praised God. From \nthen on, she was His.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately, she showed a new concern for her parents. And as soon as \ncircumstances permitted, she studied at Moody Bible Institute and \nbecame a missionary. On a long voyage across the Pacific, she studied \nKorean. By the time she reached the peninsula, she could read it \nwell. But Korea proved hard to her. The cold sapped her strength. She \nhad a nervous breakdown her first year. But she learned lessons of \nobedience. Finally bad health forced her home.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter her father died, she took up mission work in Arizona, where she \nhoped the climate would be kinder to her health. Increasingly she \nbecame aware that the Navajo people needed the Bible in their own \nlanguage. After taking a course at the Summer Institute of \nLinguistics, she became convinced she could do the work and that God \nwanted her to. But finding the necessary time was impossible. She \ndecided to leave the Presbyterian mission and join Wycliffe Bible \nTranslators.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was still many years before the New Testament became a Navajo \nbook. But she had several willing helpers. One of them, Roger, had \ntaught himself to read his native language from an English-Navajo \ndictionary while recuperating in a hospital! He once said, \"This is \nnot just a missionary talking to us in another language--this is \nGod's word in Navajo. It is just like God talking!\" The expression \nfor soul was \"that which stands up in you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of the translation, Faye became worn out. And then she \nwas thrown out of a car and dragged a great distance. Miraculously \nshe survived with minor injuries. In 1954, the completed translation \nwas sent to the American Bible Society for publication. It was not \nuntil 1956 after proofreading, revisions and corrections that the \nbook finally came off the press. It was an instant success, a \nbestseller in the tribe. It spurred the Navajo to new efforts to \nlearn to read their own tongue. Even before the book was off the \npress, Faye, now in her sixties, with a helper named Faith, began \nlearning Apache so they could translate the Bible into that language. \nNine years later the Apache New Testament also went to press. But \nFaye did not stop working on new translations and revisions until \njust days before her death in 1968. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nWallis, Ethel Emily. God Speaks Navajo.

    "words": "From:\u0014\n\u0014\nForgiving the Sins of My Father\u0014\nHow he taught me the deeper meaning of mercy. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeslie Leyland Fields/ May 5, 2014 Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nForgiveness is trendy. In the past 15 years, the topic has been \nushered out of the church and into mainstream and primetime, so much \nso that Jeanne Safer wrote for Psychology Today, \"From the political \nto the personal, Americans are caught in an orgy of forgiveness.\" A \nnumber of academic institutions have formed forgiveness projects and \ninstitutes, including the International Forgiveness Institute at the \nUniversity of WisconsinMadison and the Stanford Forgiveness \nProjects. Fueled by foundation grants and hope, hundreds of studies \nin the fields of medicine, mental health, and the social sciences \naffirm the extraordinary power of forgiveness to lower blood \npressure, reduce stress and depression, boost the immune system, and \nincrease feelings of compassion and optimism even for the most \ntraumatized individuals.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the West, forgiveness projects have brought healing and \nreparation to countries devastated by state-led and ethnically driven \nbrutality, including Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Africa. \nThese projects have at least interrupted generational cycles of \nvengeance, hatred, and genocide.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in the States, the message of forgiveness has taken a decidedly \nAmerican tone, becoming increasingly secularized and individualized, \nparticularly in the past five years. The names of authors and \narticles are too many to list here, but a theme emerges: Forgiveness \nis a choice, and it's primarily for our good. Fred Luskin, director \nof the Stanford Forgiveness Projects, delineates a nine-step process \nto \"forgiving for good,\" stating outright, \"Forgiveness is for you \nand not for anyone else.\" Some forgiveness outlets counsel empathy \ntoward the offender, but for many the impetus is personal health: \nreleasing bitterness toward the offender, detaching from the \noffender, and regaining well-being and control.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"therapeutic forgiveness\" model has entered the public parlance \nas a kind of self-administered miracle cure. A New Age blog running \nthe headline, \"I Forgive for Myself,\" typifies the reigning \ntherapeutic understanding of forgiveness. The author states, \"I am \nnot forgiving for the good of the other person. I am forgiving for \nthe good of myself so I can be free and move forward.\" So goes the \nmantra: \"Forgive and set yourself free.\" Dr. Phil joins the chorus, \nurging his readers toward forgiveness to gain \"emotional closure.\"\u0014",

My fair skin, strawberry blond hair, \nanalytical mind, and impatience with all things not just-so come \nstraight from him. Anyone who knows me and knows him knows that I am \nmy father's daughter. The fact that I am made in his image does not \nget diminished at all because I am female.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same is true for being made in God's image. Women and men equally \nare made in God's image, a characteristic and identity that's not \ntied to our sex: \"Male and female he made them,\" all of us, in his \nimage.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing made in God's image entails far more significant qualities than \nour sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing made in God's image means, among other things, that we are \nmoral beings, able to have consciousness of right and wrong, good and \nevil. It means we share a vocation as vice-regents in the stewardship \nof his creation. It means that we are eternal, created to live \nforever. We are creative like our Creator, co-creators in multiplying \nhis image-bearers. Like God, we love and hate and anger and hurt in \nways that can't be explained merely by firing neurons and surging \nchemicals. We have language, and that language shapes us as we shape \nthe world through our words. It means we can recognize and appreciate \nbeauty. We long.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone of these characteristics of God, reflected in the creatures that \nbear his image, are confined to one sex or the other. I am no less \nmade in my earthly father's image in being female than I am in being \nmade in my heavenly Father's image.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet some purport that in order for us to understand the fullness of \nwoman being created in God's image, it's helpful to refer to God \n\"herself.\" Of course, the call for gender-neutral language has been \naround for nearly half a century. (I generally favor its use as it \nrelates to human beings, although \"I will make you fishers of \npersons\" will never sound quite right to these ears.) In the most \nrecent iteration of the debate over God's pronouns and names, I was \nsurprised to learn that some Christians claim that other Christians \nare teaching that women aren't made in God's image. I have not been \nable to find anyone making this assertion. Some interpret this view \nas an implication of complementarian thinking, though the Council of \nBiblical Manhood and Womanhood (with whom I disagree on other \nsubstantial issues) does not take this position.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo let's be clear: We need not refer to God as female to understand \nthat women are fully made in God's image. The reality of my being \nmade in my father's imagewhether my earthly father or my heavenly \nonedoes not depend on my referring to either as \"she.\" By way of \nanalogy, the fact that my husband is more nurturing and romantic than \nI does not render him \"she,\" nor me \"he.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, while God, as Spirit, is sexless, his names are \ngendered. The terms \"sex\" and \"gender\" are commonly conflated, \nparticularly by Christians who often are uncomfortable using the \nformer term; \"sex\" refers to biological function while \"gender\" \nrefers to socially and culturally constructed roles, in addition to \nits use in grammar which is also related to the topic at hand. Thus, \nas my colleague at Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, Gary Yates, \npoints out, \"All language about God is analogical in some sense.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can know something about everyone, including God, by their \nnamesbut not everything. Yet, in our attempt to know and understand \none another through language, it is not within our right to change \nanyone's name, least of all God's. A high view of Scripture, \ntherefore, demands that we address God in the terms used by the \ninspired writers of his word. Whether their language reflects the \ngender of the Hebrew language or reflects the patriarchal views or \nboth, God chose these writers in that time and place to record his \nword.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the abundance of lush feminine imagery used in the Bible to \nconvey God's character does not give us license to change the gender \nof his names. One of the most compelling examples of feminine imagery \nfor God to be found in the canon of Western literature, a text I \nteach regularly, is Revelations of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich, \na 14th-century mystic and anchoress.\u0014\n\u0014\nAppearing in both a short text and a later expanded work, Revelations \ndescribes both God and Jesus as a Mother, using evocative, \ninstructive, but extra-biblical imagery. Julian's poetic descriptions \nof God's great love are powerful and transformative, but her use of \nthe term \"Mother\" in reference to God and Christ is not biblically \nwarranted. Nevertheless, Julian's work is an important piece in the \nhistory of Christian literature from both a literary and a historical \nperspective. The work is excellent evidence that the Scriptures are \ncentral to a robust theology and that denying access to those \nscriptures and sound scriptural teaching will leave a void that will \nnot go unfilled. Revelations of Divine Love also demonstrates that \nwomen have voices, those voices will be spoken, and to oppress women \nor hinder their learning or leadership will only set back the church \nand the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf fallen humanity has wielded God's language and character as \nbludgeons against women (or any people), then such injustices must be \ncorrected. Yet we must not try to remedy injustice with error. If we \ndo we unwittingly strengthen the hands of those wielding the \nbludgeons. We need not employ wrong-headedor wrongstrategies to \nachieve right ends.\u0014",

    "title": "FACTS ABOUT RIVA RIDGE",
    "words": "Here are some little-known facts about our forgotten champion Riva \nRidge:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was named for a mountain area in the Italian Appennines which the \nArmy Tenth Mountain Divison captured during World War II. Read our \nbook to find out how this connects to the Tweedy family and the Vail \nski resort in Colorado. \u0014\n\u0014\nRiva was a sickly foal when he first came to The Meadow in Virginia. \nHoward Gentry, farm manager, said You could run your fingers along \nhis ribs and play a tune.\u0014\n\u0014\nRiva, his dam Iberia, and all the other Meadow broodmares and foals \ncould have been lost when the river near their pasture flooded due to \nHurricane Camille in 1969. But the alert workers rounded them up and \ngot them to safety in the broodmare barn atop a hill.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Secretariat, who was considered rather lazy on the training \ntrack by his early handlers, Riva as a young colt showed speed early \non. In fact, his first rider at The Meadow said he had trouble \nholding him back.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Lucien Laurins training facility, Ron Turcotte noticed that while \nRiva could run, he seemed to be afraid of the other horses. Ron \nconvinced Lucien to let him work with the colt and he helped Riva \novercome his timidity on the track.\u0014\n\u0014\nRiva won $500,000 as a two-year-old and the champion title for his \nage group in 1971. Most of all, his earnings quelled the demands from \nPennys family to sell The Meadow and all its horses. Such a \ndispersal sale would have included Secretariat, then a yearling. \nThus, Riva saved the farm and paved the way for Secretariat.\u0014\n\u0014\nRivas Derby win in 1972 was the seventh fastest on record. His \nBelmont was the third fastest, surpassing Citation and Count Fleet.\u0014\n\u0014\nRiva nearly was scratched from the Belmont. A boisterous fan smacked \nhim on the rump in the saddling paddock, causing Riva to kick out and \ninjure his hind leg. Lucien was ready to withdraw him from the race, \nbut then he walked it off.\u0014\n\u0014\nRiva and Secretariat dueled it out in the Marlboro Cup on September \n15, 1973. While everyone remembers Secretariat winning and setting a \nworld record, Riva broke the track record, finishing three lengths \nbehind, carrying 127 pounds to Secretariats 124.\u0014\n\u0014\nRiva was syndicated for $5 million; Secretariat for $6 million. While \nBig Red was known as a quick breeder at Claiborne Farm, Riva was \nknown as a shy breeder. The stallion grooms said it sometimes took \nRiva more than an hour to get in the mood to perform his duties \nwith a mare. Nevertheless, he was always a farm favorite.\u0014",

While youre out celebrating with family and friends, here \nis some strange Independence Day trivia to share, courtesy of \\ABC \nNews, History.com and Fourth of July Trivia.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat day did most signers of \\the Declaration of Independence \nactually sign the document? \u0014\n\u0014\nAug. 2, 1776.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many people signed the Declaration of Independence on July \nFourth? \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo\u0014\n\u0014\nThree of the first five presidents died on the Fourth of July:\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James \\Monroe. Adams, the second \npresident, and Jefferson, the third, died on the same day in 1826, \nthe 50th anniversary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich president was born on the Fourth of July?\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin Coolidge, the 30th president, in 1872.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat other countries celebrate the Fourth of July?\u0014\n\u0014\nDenmark, England, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Denmark Danes and \nNorwegians celebrate American Independence Day because thousands \nemigrated to the U.S. in the early 1900s. Other European countries, \nlike England, Portugal and Sweden, hold \\celebrations near American \nmilitary bases and or spots frequented by American tourists to boost \ntravel during early July. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow did the Nathans Fourth of July Hot Dog Contest begin? \u0014\n\u0014\nIt apparently started after a disagreement among four immigrants over \nwho was the most patriotic.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Adams would think the country is celebrating Independence Day on \nthe wrong date: \u0014\n\u0014\nAdams wrote that July 2, the date the \\Second Continental Congress \nvoted in Philadelphia to declare independence from Britain, not July \n4, would be the day patriots celebrated their freedom. The Second \nDay of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History \nof America, Adams wrote on July 3. It ought to be solemnized with \nPomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and \nIlluminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this \nTime forward forever more.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did the Fourth of July become a legal federal holiday? \u0014\n\u0014\n1938\u0014\n\u0014\nIs there something written on the back of the Declaration of \nIndependence? \u0014\n\u0014\nYes. It might not be a treasure map as Nicholas Cages character \nclaims in National Treasure, but there is apparently a message \nwritten upside down at the bottom of the signed document: Original \nDeclaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776. Its not known who \nwrote it or when. Since parchment was usually rolled up during the \nRevolutionary War years, its thought this memo served as a label.\u0014",

Grimk was the son of wealthy Henry Grimk, a white \nplanter, and Nancy Weston, a black slave. He was born in 1850 at \nCaneacres, a rice plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. His \nwhite aunts were Quaker abolitionists, the most notable of whom was \nAngelina.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Henry Grimk died in 1852, his will freed Francis and placed him \nunder the guardianship of his white half-brother, Montague. Eight \nyears later, when Montague threatened to enslave Francis, who was now \nten years old, he fled and served as valet to a Confederate officer. \nWhen Grimk visited Charleston some months later, Montague seized and \nimprisoned him. Francis became ill and would have died had his mother \nnot been allowed to nurse him. Before he was completely well again, \nhis brother Montague sold him to another officer. But at the end of \nthe war, Francis was emancipated with other African-Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimk now acknowledged Francis' \nrelationship to them and various individuals gave him financial aid \nto attend Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Later, feeling drawn to \nthe ministry, he entered Princeton Theological Seminary from which he \ngraduated in 1878.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 7, 1878, Francis was ordained as a Presbyterian \nminister. He would spend over fifty years in the pulpit, most of it \nat Washington's 15th Street Presbyterian Church. He was noted as one \nof the most articulate opponents of racism: \"Race prejudice can't be \ntalked down, it must be lived down.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was convinced that if Blacks put their trust in God, He would \nstrengthen them as he strengthened the Israelites. \"The race that \nputs its trust in God has always, under all circumstances, more for \nit than against it.\" One of Grimk's strongest arguments for equality \nwas this: \"Another great principle of the religion of Jesus Christ \nis, that all Christians are one in him--together they constitute one \nfamily.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLike his contemporary Booker T. Washington, the educator of Tuskegee, \nGrimk emphasized honesty, hard work, thrift and eternal values, \ndenouncing loose sexual morals. \"It is only what is written upon the \nsoul of man that will survive the wreck of time,\" he said. However, \nwhen Grimk perceived Booker T. Washington was going soft on civil \nrights, he sided with the more radical and socialistic W. E. B. \nDubois and helped bring into existence the NAACP.

The governor \nproclaimed three days of prayer to end the Texas drought in 2011, \nsaying, I think its time for us to just hand it over to God, and \nsay, God: Youre going to have to fix this.  The drought got \nworse. Two years ago, Perry said that God had not changed his mind \nabout same-sex marriage. But the states have. Since Perry became a \nspokesman for the deity, the map of legalized gay marriage in America \nhas expanded by 50 percent. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, these are pillow feathers in a world weighted down with \nmisery. God is on a rampage in 2014, a bit like the Old Testament \nscourge who gave direct instructions to people to kill one another. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts not true that all wars are fought in the name of religion, as \nsome atheists assert. Of 1,723 armed conflicts documented in the \nthree-volume Encyclopedia of Wars, only 123, or less than 7 \npercent, involved a religious cause. Hitlers genocide, Stalins \nbloody purges and Pol Pots mass murders certainly make the case that \nstate-sanctioned killings do not need the invocation of a higher \npower to succeed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this year, the ancient struggle of My God versus Your God is at \nthe root of dozens of atrocities, giving pause to the optimists among \nus (myself included) who believe that while the arc of enlightenment \nis long, it still bends toward the better. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the name of God and hate, Sunnis are killing Shiites in Iraq, and \nvice versa. A jihadist militia, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, \nboasts of beheading other Muslims while ordering women to essentially \nlive in caves, faces covered, minds closed. The two sides of a single \nfaith have been sorting it out in that blood-caked land, with long \nperiods of peace, since the year 632. Dont expect it to end soon. A \nmajority of the worlds 1.6 billion Muslims are peaceful, but a Pew \nSurvey found that 40 percent of Sunnis do not think Shiites are \nproper Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nElsewhere, a handful of failed states are seeing carnage over some \nvariant of the seventh-century dispute. And the rage that moved Hamas \nto lob rockets on birthday parties in Tel Aviv, and Israelis to kill \nchildren playing soccer on the beach in Gaza, has its roots in the \nspiritual superiority of extremists on both sides. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most horrific of the religion-inspired zealots may be Boko Haram \nin Nigeria. As is well known thanks to a feel-good and largely \nuseless Twitter campaign, 250 girls were kidnapped by these gangsters \nfor the crime of attending school. Boko Harams God tells them to \nsell the girls into slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe current intra-religious fights are not to be confused with people \nwho fly airplanes into buildings, or shoot up innocents while \nshouting God is great. But those killers most assuredly believed \nthat their reward for murder is heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf late, God has taken a long break from Ireland, such a small \ncountry for such a big fight between worshipers under the same cross. \nThere, the animus is not so much theological as it is historical. If \nthe curious Muslim is wondering why Protestants and Catholics cant \njust get along on that lovely island, take a look at the Thirty \nYears War of the 17th century, when about 20 percent of the \npopulation of present-day Germany fell to clashes between the two \nbranches of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nViolent Buddhist mobs (yes, it sounds oxymoronic) are responsible for \na spate of recent attacks against Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, \nleaving more than 200 dead and close to 150,000 homeless. The clashes \nprompted the Dalai Lama to make an urgent appeal to end the \nbloodshed. Buddha preaches love and compassion, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so do Christianity, Islam and Judaism. The problem is that people \nof faith often become fanatics of faith. Reason and force are useless \nagainst aspiring martyrs. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the United States, God is on the currency. By brilliant design, \nthough, he is not mentioned in the Constitution. The founders were \nexplicit: This country would never formally align God with one \npolitical party, or allow someone to use religion to ignore civil \nlaws. At least that was the intent. In this summer of the violent \nGod, five justices on the Supreme Court seem to feel otherwise.\u0014",

The Times-Dispatch ranks Reagan among \u0014\nthe 20th century's greatest presidents. We have not been fully \u0014\nhappy since he left office. \u0014\n\u0014\nConservatives also forget. Reagan not only committed errors \u0014\nbut he also deviated from ideological purity. The other day, for \u0014\ninstance, former Sen. Bill Brock (R-Tenn.) noted that Reagan supported\u0014\nan expansion of the Export-Import Bank. Today, opposition to the bank \u0014\nhas become a litmus test.

He negotiated arms reductions with a \nSoviet \u0014\nUnion that posed a greater threat than either Iran or North Korea \u0014\nposes now.

The bombing of the Marine barracks in \u0014\nBeirut was a more grievous event than the Benghazi disgrace. \u0014\nReagan traded arms for hostages; he evaded restrictions on \u0014\nmilitary support for Nicaragua's insurgents.

He (and Mikhail Gorbachev) laid the groundwork for a \u0014\npeaceful conclusion to the Cold War. The country mourned his \u0014\npassing with a vast display of affection. Republicans and \u0014\nconservatives vow to follow his example.

    "title": "FRANCIS OF ASSISI HAD A VISION",
    "words": "When Francis of Assisi was in his early forties, he gave up \nleadership of the Franciscans, the great order he had founded. This \nwas not done in pique or bitterness but with a quiet acceptance that \nevents had moved beyond him. His simple and stringent rule was too \ndifficult for the many who had swarmed into the order because of his \nfame and the powerful preaching of his followers. They wanted the \nrule relaxed, and relaxed it would be.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Francis thought he could now be just one of the brothers, he was \nmistaken. None had such zeal as he. Of none would such legends be \ntold. To none other would such visions come.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe decided to spend some days before the Feast of the Assumption at \nMt. Alvernia. In that wilderness a flock of birds settled around and \nupon him to the astonishment of his few companions and succeeding \ngenerations. At Mt. Alvernia, Francis decided he needed more \nsolitude. The sense of his own sin was heavy upon him, and he longed \nfor a taste of heaven in order to bear the pain of his past \nwrongdoing. He found a lonely spot in the forest across a chasm. Only \none man was allowed to approach him in his solitude: his spiritual \nson Leo; and even Leo was told to call out and receive permission \nbefore crossing the limb which served as a bridge to Francis' \nisolation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe brothers feared for Francis. He was gravely ill. One night Leo \napproached the chasm and called out. Francis did not answer. Leo \ncalled again. Perhaps the master had taken ill. Fearful of \ndisobedience and yet even more fearful that the holy leader might be \ndying unattended, Leo crossed the limb.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis' cell was empty. Yet the moon was bright. Leo went some way \nand heard a voice. It was Francis, praying, \"Who are you, my dearest \nLord? And who am I, a most vile worm and your most unprofitable \nservant?\" Leo saw a light shine down upon Francis and knew that words \nwere spoken to him, although he could not hear them. Francis raised \nhis hands into the light. The light disappeared. Leo turned to creep \naway, but Francis heard. He challenged him, for he was almost blind. \nLeo confessed he had broken the command. Francis was gentle. The \ntransgression was from love.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis told Leo that he had been commanded to give three gifts, and \nthese three gifts were as golden balls in his bosom: poverty, \nchastity and obedience. He had held them up to the Lord. The two men \nthen read and prayed together. Then on the morning of this date, \nSeptember 14, 1224, the day of the Feast of the Holy Cross, as \nFrancis was communing with the Lord, a Seraph appeared to him. The \nfigure of Christ crucified appeared between his wings. Joy and agony \nsuffused Francis. His prayers for forgiveness, to share Christ's \nsufferings, to be purified had been heard. When the angel left, in \nwhat is regarded as one of the classic experiences of Christian \nhistory, Francis' hands feet and sides bore five wounds, the marks of \nthe stigmata. Two years later he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur. Saints in Christian Art. London: George Bell, 1901 \n- 1904. Source of the image.\u0014\nDurant, Will.

    "words": "Andy Kravetz\u0014\nJournal Star courts reporter (Illinois)\u0014\nUpdated Sep 10, 2014 at 9:39 PM \u0014\n\u0014\nPEORIA  A former missionary, Nathan Leuthold was described by many \nas a good person, but all that was poisoned by the murder of his \nwife, a judge said Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have to give you credit. You have led a law-abiding life, and for \nmany years, you did good things. But you have poisoned it all, \nPeoria County Circuit Judge Kevin Lyons said before sentencing \nLeuthold to 80 years in prison for the Feb. 14, 2013, execution-style \nmurder of Denise Leuthold, 39.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeuthold, 39, didnt move or flinch. Instead, he remained stoic and \nexpressionless as he has throughout most of the 18 months while his \ncase was pending. Lyons, however, sounded emotional, and his voice \nwould often rise during his 26-minute speech to Leuthold and the \npacked second-floor courtroom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge said it was shameful to kill his wife in her parents home, \na happy place. He called him a thief for taking Denise away from \nher three children and her family. Emails from Nathan Leuthold \nexpressing glee over his children embracing 21-year-old Aina \nDobilaite, a Lithuanian student the Leutholds sponsored, as a \nsurrogate mother were about as over-the-top gut-wrenching as it \ngets, Lyons said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA relative of Denise Leuthold read a statement saying the Newton \nfamily was disgusted by the actions of their son-in-law.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are repulsed at his calculated, evil scheming. He has robbed us \nof the rest of our daughters life, the statement said. Weve had \nto wrestle with Nathans hypocrisy in claiming to be a man of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Peoria County jury took a scant 90 minutes after six days of \ntestimony and more than 40 witnesses to find him guilty of murdering \nhis wife about 12:30 p.m. that day. At his mid-July trial, \nprosecutors argued Nathan Leuthold killed his wife to be with his \nmistress, Dobilaite. He staged the break-in at his in-laws home, 700 \nW. Mossville Road, where he and his family were staying, to cover his \ntracks, they claimed.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenise Leutholds body was found about 3 p.m. that day. Within hours, \npolice zeroed in on Nathan Leuthold as a suspect. Testimony from \ndetectives said he didnt act right when he was told about his \nwifes death and that the scene seemed too neat and orderly for a \nburglary.\u0014",

    "words": "As I watched the Florida State-Notre Dame football game last night, I \nthought of all the problems FSU has had with star quarterback, Jamies \nWinston [charges of shoplifting, rape, and public obscenity] and of \nFSUs history of such players. That sort of thing didnt happen under \nCoach Darrel Mudra. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had been fired at Florida State after only two years, for not \nwinning enough games fast enough, even though he won more his second \nyear than his first. Eastern Illinois University was glad to pick him \nup. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe year before, the EIU panthers had won only one game. In Mudras \nfirst year, they won the national championship.\u0014\n \u0014\nHis career record was 200-81-4, 70.9 %. Hes in the national football \nhall of fame. His nickname is Dr. Victory. His expertise and \nreputation were in taking long-time losing programs and turning them \ninto winners. Thats why FSU hired him. Despite all that, FSU gave \nMudra only two years to turn their floundering program around. \u0014\n\u0014\nBobby Bowden, who succeeded Mudra at FSU, has said that it was Mudra \nwho really turned FSU football around and made it possible for him to \nwin. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark Dantonio, the hugely successful coach at Michigan State U, says \nthat there is no secret to football success. You recruit one good \nyoung man at a time. You help them become better persons, \nacademically, socially, relationally. As they become better persons, \nthey become better players. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt takes more than two years to turn good young men into better young \nmen. It takes even longer to take young men who have never been \nexpected to be good and get them to see that being a good football \nplayer is not as important as being a good person. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt takes a long time to turn anyone into a good person. \u0014\n\u0014\nDarrel Mudra attended worship services at my church when he coached \nat EIU. I was a long distance runner in those days and often used the \nmile-long woodchip trail around the university athletic fields, \nincluding the football practice field. Sometimes Coach Mudra would be \nstanding under a tree, watching practice from a distance, as I ran. \nId stop and chat and give him tips, the way people who know just a \nlittle about something like to advise folks who know a lot about it. \u0014\n\u0014\nA number of the football players came to church, too. I asked them \nabout Coach Mudra, who was famous for always coaching from the press \nbox, not on the field. He hardly ever talks to us about football, \nthey said. He asks us what we want to do with our lives, what our \ngoals are, who we want to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland, 10/19/14   Christ in Winter blog\u0014",

After the mother and jurors left the courtroom, Brown told \nthe judge he was innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, 53, faces a mandatory term of life in prison without parole \nwhen sentenced June 19 for the murder and special circumstances that \nhe lay in wait and killed the girl for financial gain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown told police the girl tripped and fell as she ran toward the \ncliff's edge at Inspiration Point in Rancho Palos Verdes.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefense lawyer Aron Laub argued that his client was a bad dad, but \nnot a murderer and asked jurors to convict him of manslaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I sincerely believe that is what happened in this case,\" Laub said \nafter the verdict. \"I have great confidence in our jury system, but I \ncannot agree that this was a just verdict.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe verdict that was nearly 12 years in coming took the jury little \nmore than a day to reach.\u0014\n\u0014\nForeman Greg Apodaca said jurors were unanimous from their first \ndiscussions and it was a \"relatively simple decision to make\" after \nhearing nearly six weeks of evidence and visiting the scenic bluff \nabout 30 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The expert witnesses made it pretty clear and when we did the site \nvisit it was clear to us, as well, that it didn't seem likely that a \n4-year-old girl would be up there of her own volition,\" Apodaca said.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecution experts said the girl's injuries were not consistent with \nan accidental fall because she couldn't have run fast enough to clear \npart of the cliff before either striking an outcropping or hitting \nthe beach below.\u0014\n\u0014\nJurors heard most of the same evidence as previous juries, but this \ntime Los Angeles sheriff's Detective Jeffrey Leslie bolstered \nevidence of a financial motive by finding someone who said Brown said \nit would be \"nice to get rid of Lauren\" to get out of paying \n$1,000-a-month child support, Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum said.\u0014",

    "title": "FIVE CHILD-REARING TECHNIQUES TO RAISE KIND KIDS",
    "words": "Harvard researchers have mapped the five child-rearing techniques you \nneed to raise kind kids\u0014\n\u0014\nAsk parents how important it is to instill kindness in their kids, \nand most will rank it high: even as their very top priority, \naccording to Harvard researchers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut children surveyed by the universitys Making Caring Common (pdf) \nproject said, overwhelmingly, that they were getting a different \nmessage. The researchers spoke with 10,000 kids at a range of middle \nand high schools in the US in 2013 to 2014. Nearly 80% said that \ntheir parents taught them that personal happiness and high \nachievement were more important than caring for other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut all is not lost. The study makes some recommendations for raising \nchildren that genuinely believe kindness is important:\u0014\n\u0014\n1) Give kids opportunities to practice being kind. Children arent \nborn with an innate ability to act kindly, but learn it in the same \nway as they might pick up an instrument or a language. Daily \nopportunities to practicesomething as simple as helping another \nchild with homeworkcan make a difference.\u0014\n\u0014\n2) Children need to learn two important skills. These will help kids \nbuild a wider circle of concern, the researchers say. Children need \nto learn to zoom in on individuals, and truly listen to them. They \nalso need to be able to zoom out to see a bigger \npictureeffectively, learning to put human experience in context.\u0014\n\u0014\n3) Kids need role models. That doesnt mean being perfect parents. It \nmeans working on empathy, and demonstrating concern and sympathy so \nthat children can be exposed to it.\u0014\n\u0014\n4) Help children manage destructive feelings. Shame, anger, and \njealousy can override the intention to be kind. Kids need to know \nthat such feelings are normal, but can be addressed in different \nways. Children are moral philosophers, the researchers write. When \nadults spark childrens thinking with ethical questions they put \nissues of injustice on childrens radar and help children learn how \nto weigh their various responsibilities to others and themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n5) Adults should stop passing the buck. Parents worry about \nchildrens moral state, the researchers note, but its hard to find \nadults who admit they might be part of the problem. Adults need to \ninterrogate the messages theyre sending, and ask themselves: what \nvalues am I really instilling?\u0014",

    "words": "Here are 9 fun facts about redheads:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe highest concentration of Redheads is in Scotland (13%) followed \nby Ireland (10%). Worldwide, only 2% of the population has red hair. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tPeople with red hair are likely more sensitive to pain. This is \nbecause the gene mutation (MC1R) that causes red hair is on the same \ngene linked to pain receptors. It also means redheads usually need \nmore anesthesia for dental and medical procedures. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHaving red hair isn't the only thing that makes some redheads \nunique. They are also more likely to be left handed. Both \ncharacteristics come from recessive genes, which like to come in \npairs. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRedheads probably won't go grey. That's because the pigment just \nfades over time. So they will probably go blonde and even white, but \nnot grey. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRumor says Hitler banned marriage between redheads. Apparently he \nthought it would lead to \"deviant offspring.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRedheads most commonly have brown eyes. The least common eye color: \nblue. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBees have been proven to be more attracted to redheads. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBeing a redheaded man may have health benefits. A study published \nby the British Journal of Cancer suggested that men with red hair are \n54% less likely to develop prostate cancer than their brown and \nblonde-haired counterparts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tRedheads actually have less hair than most other people. On average \nthey only have 90,000 strands of hair while blonds, for example, have \n140,000. However, red hair is typically thicker so they it still \nlooks just as full.\u0014",

Williams, a Puritan, worked as a teacher before serving \nbriefly as a colorful pastor at Plymouth and then at Salem. Within a \nfew years of his arrival, he alarmed the Puritan oligarchy of \nMassachusetts by speaking out against the right of civil authorities \nto punish religious dissension and to confiscate Indian land. In \nOctober 1635, he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony by \nthe General Court.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter leaving Massachusetts, Williams, with the assistance of the \nNarragansett tribe, established a settlement at the junction of two \nrivers near Narragansett Bay, located in present-day Rhode Island. He \ndeclared the settlement open to all those seeking freedom of \nconscience and the removal of the church from civil matters, and many \ndissatisfied Puritans came. Taking the success of the venture as a \nsign from God, Williams named the community Providence.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who found a haven in the religious and political refuge \nof the Rhode Island Colony were Anne Hutchinson, like Williams, \nexiled from Massachusetts for religious reasons; some of the first \nJews to settle in North America; and the Quakers.

    "words": "The year 1492 is most often associated with Columbus and his \ndiscovery of America. But another event of tragic proportions \ndeveloped that year. It gave the world the Sephardic Jews (so called \nbecause Sepharadh was a region of Spain where many Jews had settled).\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1492, Spain, under Ferdinand and Isabella had just emerged as a \ndefender of the Roman Catholic faith. The marriage of the two rulers \neventually united Aragon and Castile, although while she lived, \nIsabella did not yield her authority to her husband. In Granada, the \npair defeated the Islamic Moors, who had long controlled Spain. \nSpurred on by the cruel Grand Inquisitor Torquemada, Ferdinand and \nIsabella felt they must remove all heretics and non-Christians from \ntheir land in order to purge it of pagan influences and firmly \nestablish the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fires of the Inquisition had already roared in Spain for twelve \nlong years. The Inquisition's primary purpose was not to deal with \nJews and Muslims. Any person who professed Christianity and then \nreturned to his or her ancestral faith was tried and punished. In \neight years, the tribunal of Seville alone put 700 persons to death \nand condemned 5,000 others to life in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what about those Jews who never adopted Christianity? Their \nmajesties had a plan for them, too. On this day, March 31, 1492, in \nthe city of Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella signed an edict banishing \nfrom the Kingdoms of Aragon and Castile all Jews unwilling to receive \nbaptism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You know well or ought to know, that whereas we have been informed \nthat in these our kingdoms there were some wicked Christians who \nJudaized and apostatized from our holy Catholic faith, the great \ncause of which was interaction between the Jews and these \nChristians...we ordered the separation of the said Jews in all the \ncities, towns and villages of our kingdoms and lordships and \n[commanded] that they be given Jewish quarters and separate places \nwhere they should live, hoping that by their separation the situation \nwould remedy itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeparation not having worked, the monarchs gave the Jews until July \n31st to sell their goods and leave the country. They were forbidden \nto carry gold or silver out of the kingdom. Worse, although signed in \nMarch, the edict was not publicly announced until the end of April, \nso the Jews actually had only three months to convert their property \nto trade goods. \u0014\nFerdinand and Isabella's Edict Against Jews  1492\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christians\" took advantage of the situation and paid ridiculously \nlow prices for Jewish possessions -- a donkey bought a house; a piece \nof cloth or linen purchased an entire vineyard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July 1492, the exodus began. When Columbus left on his famous \nvoyage in August, he could not use the port of Cadiz because of the \nlarge numbers of Jews waiting to board ships in the harbor. Many Jews \nof Castile went to Portugal, where they were forced to pay a ransom \nto remain. Others went to Italy or the northern coast of Africa. \nWherever they went, they were robbed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpain's economy paid for its mistreatment of the Jews: many had been \nskilled craftsmen. Sultan Bajazet of Turkey warmly welcomed those who \nescaped to his country. \"How can you call Ferdinand of Aragon a wise \nking--the same Ferdinand who impoverished his own land and enriched \nours?\" he asked. He employed the Jew in making weapons to fight \nagainst Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\n\"Ferdinand V, King of Castile.\" Encyclopedia Americana.

    "words": "Feuerbach: a Theologian Who Wasn't\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Christianity is also the story of attacks on \nChristianity. On this day July 28, 1804 Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach was \nborn. His father was a well-known jurist who exerted tremendous \ninfluence in the field of German law. He was also a petty, moralizing \ntyrant at home who betrayed Feuerbach's mother for another man's \nwife. It has sometimes been remarked that the ranks of atheists are \nmost often joined by men who hate their fathers. Feuerbach, who had \nmuch reason to dislike his father, attacked Christianity mercilessly. \nLike his follower Marx, he adopted materialist presuppositions and \ntherefore considered his critique of the faith scientific. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a youth Feuerbach became deeply interested in religion and pored \nover Hebrew. He studied theology at Heidelberg and then won \npermission to transfer to Berlin. Because of his involvement in a \nstudent club he came under the suspicion of the police and was held \nup from becoming a professor. He was able to show he was involved in \nno secret organization. On this day July 28, 1824, his 20th birthday, \nhe was admitted to the theology faculty. He had, however, already \nbecome a follower of Hegel. He would never teach theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first move was to transfer to the philosophy department. \nFinancial difficulties led him to relocate to Erlanger where he \nlectured on philosophy for many years as a private lecturer. His \nfirst lecture attacked Christianity. By 1830 he had issued \nanonymously a book titled Thoughts on Death and Immortality. He wrote \nmockingly that religion was \"merely a kind of insurance company.\" His \nauthorship became known and it barred him from advancement. \nFeuerbach's father was appalled. Believe such things privately, but \ndo not ruin your career by openly flaunting public opinion, he \nadvised.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeuerbach's response was to issue his \"Essence of Christianity.\" In \nthis and his other works he declared religion a fantasy--an attempt \nat wish-fulfillment. \"The more empty life is, the more concrete is \nGod...Only the poor man has a rich God.\" He argued that man wants to \nbe a god with godlike powers; because he cannot have these powers, he \ndreams up a god who does. Practical men, however, turn to science and \ntechnology which can satisfy real needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat would Feuerbach have thought of the life of his fellow-German \nGeorge Mller, who proved the practicality of faith, scientifically \nrecording every prayer and its answer? Feuerbach saw religion \nemerging from the feeling of dependence. Mller learned to come to \nGod in Christ's name for every need.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeuerbach's idea prospered for a decade. The Essence of Christianity \nwent through eleven printings. After the failed revolution of 1848 it \nfaded into virtual oblivion, though not without influencing Wagner \nand Nietzsche. George Eliot translated his work into English. Ernest \nRenan, who himself tried to \"demythologize\" the life of Christ, \ndescribed Feuerbach as antichrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nKamenka, Eugene.

    "title": "FOX ORGANIZED SUNDAY SCHOOL SOCIETY",
    "words": "On this day, September 7, 1785, the Prescott Street Baptist Church of \nLondon was humming with activity. Behind the stir was a Baptist \ndeacon named William Fox. Impressed by the Sunday school work of \nGloucester's newspaper editor Robert Raikes which tallied with ideas \nhe had earlier tried to implement, William had called for an \nassociation to assist and promote Sunday schools. The bustle meant \nthat his ideas were in process of implementation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam was an extraordinary individual who developed his first \nbusiness plan at the age of ten and completely fulfilled it. When he \nbecame successful he remained deeply concerned for the poor and did \nwhat he could to meet their needs through attempts at legislation, \nthrough efforts for their education and his single-handed endeavors \nto clothe them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking more leverage, William wrote Raikes about his educational \nplan. Raikes responded, \"I am full of admiration at the great and \nnoble design of the society you speak of forming. If it were possible \nthat my poor abilities could be rendered in any degree useful to you, \npoint out the subject, and you will find me not inactive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRaikes was as good as his word; he and other prominent \nphilanthropists gathered to implement William's idea. The result was \nthe first Sunday School Society for Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to overemphasize the value of this society. To begin with, \nit coached the poor each week, educating thousands who otherwise \nwould have had no schooling. The society established rules, provided \ntextbooks and offered funding. Close to 4,000 Sunday schools were \nformed. This spelled relief for many communities in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the last half of the eighteenth century, many communities \ndreaded Sunday. It was the one day that factory children had off; not \nsurprisingly they were rowdy on that day. Between 1702 and 1801, the \npopulation of England doubled; more and more people were moving to \nthe cities and towns to find work in the factories. The traditional \nsocial and religious ties of village life were severed. Often there \nwas no place for the country folk in the town churches, and a \ngeneration or two of children grew up without any religious or moral \nguidelines.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Raikes, owner and printer of the Gloucester Journal, had \npondered the fate of the young ruffians. Visiting the prisons, he saw \nhow easy it was for the children to slip into crime. Raikes knew that \nthe parents of these children were so steeped in sin themselves they \nhad no intention of training them to do better. Some other means of \nteaching these youngsters must be found or many more would end up in \nprisons.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaikes hired four women to teach the children to read in schools that \nwould run on Sunday. With the help of Reverend Thomas Stock, he \nenrolled one hundred children, from six to fourteen years old. The \nteachers gave the children reading lessons from ten to two, with an \nhour break for lunch. Then they marched them to church, after which \nthey were taught the catechism until 5:30 P.M. Good behavior was \nrewarded with small prizes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam's innovation was to form Sunday schools under volunteer \nteachers and to focus on Bible studies rather than secular subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\nBrown, Arlo.

    "title": "FAKE NEWS, GOSSIP AND \"JUST WANT MY CHURCH BACK\"",
    "words": "Fake news, gossip and Just want my church back!\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Bullard | December 30, 2016   Baptist Global News\u0014\n\u0014\nPosting fake news is an action that impacted the 2016 presidential \nelection season. So much fake news appeared on news sites, websites, \nsocial media and through direct messages that it clouded true and \naccurate news.\u0014\n\u0014\nA representative of one mainstream news agency said there was so much \nfake news clogging the communication channels during the election \nthat they could not keep up with fact checking and clarifying for the \npublic what was true and what was not.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust in case you are not familiar with the term fake news, it is \nthe deliberate attempt to publish disinformation with the hope people \nwill spread the false information through social media, word-of-mouth \nand other forms of communication. The desired result is that people \nwill believe the fake news is truth, pass it on as truth, react to it \nas truth, and take actions  such as voting  based on the belief it \nis truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nFake news is different from news satire which is parody that creates \na humorist situation, pokes fun at people, and helps the hearer think \nabout the news and the truth in deeper or more diverse ways. News \nsatire uses irony which is the use of words that convey the opposite \nof the real meaning. Satire is for humor and provocation, and not to \nbe represented as truth. Fake news seeks to claim it is truth, not \nirony.\u0014\n\u0014\nGossip is a form of fake news. It communicates and circulates in \noral, written and digital form what are at best half-truths and at \nworst lies about people and situations. In other forms, it exposes \nprivate information about persons which was not originally \ncommunicated for public hearing.\u0014\n\u0014\nA recent segment of the new television series Bull used gossip to \nalter the perspective of a jury in a trial in a small town in New \nEngland. Dr. Bull and his staff intentionally put out a fake story \nwith the intention of communicating gossip throughout the community \nso the opinion of a jury would be changed. It worked, and the accused \nwas found innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis use of gossip in a tight social network shows the power of \ngossip and other forms of fake news.\u0014\n\u0014\nCongregations are a similar type of tight social network. Good, bad, \nhelpful and harmful information can spread rapidly throughout \ncongregations. During the 1970s I was pastor of an inner-city church \nin Louisville, Ky. This was before voice mail, email, and social \nmedia. When I needed to quickly get word out to my congregation and \nthe community, or to correct disinformation, I would call one person.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrene Featheringill was a member of the church all her adult life, \nand the church secretary for more than 20 years. She knew the heads \nof the grapevines in the congregation and the community. If there had \nbeen a death, or we needed prayer for a crisis within our fellowship, \nI would simply connect with Irene, tell her the true information, and \nthen say, Our people need to know about this. That was all I had to \ndo. She took it from there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world of communication is more complicated now.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent conversation with friends who are members of another \nchurch in our state, they told me about the current conflict in their \ncongregation. It had escalated to the point an outside person was \nbrought in to moderate a business meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn dialogue sessions, prayer meetings, and the business meeting \nitself they heard so much disinformation that they wondered where it \nall originated. Throughout their small town the grapevines were \nactive with gossip and fake news about the pastor and the bad \ndirection in which he was leading the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is the pastor sought to lead the church in innovative ways. \nThe full weight of the innovations caused people to realize the \nchurch was changing from what it had formerly been. Two other \nchurches of the same denomination in this small town were having \nsimilar conflict. All of this was occurring during the recent \ncontentious presidential election. We know from history that \ncontentious elections make their way into the life and ministry of \ncongregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the season of conflict an oft repeated refrain was I just \nwant my church back! This phrase raises a red flag in many \nsituations. Yes, at times a congregation is led in a bad direction, \nso it is human to want back the church previously known. If this is \nthe truth, then fine. It should be addressed. If this is truth based \non fake news and gossip, it may represent a desire by loud voices to \ncontrol the congregation  to take the reins of control away from God \nand reimage the congregation as a cultural enclave rather than a \nChrist-centered, faith-based community.\u0014\n\u0014\nI just want my church back! can mean congregants have forgotten \nchurches belong to our Triune God and not to ourselves. A \ncongregation is led forward by Gods empowering vision and not back \nto a culturally comfortable place.\u0014\n\u0014\nCongregations should remember the admonition of Henry David Thoreau, \nNever look back unless you are planning to go that way.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur Triune God encourages us through the Apostle Pauls letter to the \nchurch at Philippi in this manner: Forgetting what lies behind and \nreaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for \nthe prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians \n3:13b-14 NASB).\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth makes us free. Fake news expressed as gossip to manipulate \ndecisions and directions imprisons us. Unleash Gods church to be \nfree to move forward into the future.\u0014",

And yet, if ever a man had grounds for discouragement \nit was Jeremiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever your struggle, the underlying questions are always the same: \nIs God really good, is he really good to me; or is he indifferent, \naloof, an underachiever, never really exerting himself for my benefit?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the fight of faithone Jeremiah fought and won.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only indication that Jeremiah ever experienced joy are a scant \nfew lines in Jeremiah 15, when a lost portion of Scripture was \nrecovered in the temple. But when the discovery sparked a \nhalf-hearted revival, Jeremiah refused to rejoice. The nation had not \ntruly repented. Their hearts were not right. And Jeremiah couldn't \nchange that. He would not see real revival in his days.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah was forbidden to marry, forbidden to mourn or offer \nconsolation, forbidden to celebrate with those who rejoice, and he \nwas on at least three occasions forbidden to pray for his unrepentant \ncountrymen (Jer 16:1-9; 7:16-20; 11:14-17; 14:11-12; 15:1). He was \nplotted against by kith and kin, by priests and prophets; pursued by \nthe king's assassins, slandered by the people, falsely accused, \nunjustly imprisoned, beaten and betrayed, a man of whom the world was \nnot worthy (Jer. 11:18-12:6; 26:7-11; 36:26; 18:18; 37:11-16; \n20:1-2). It was not without cause that he, too, looked for an undo \nbutton on his existence:\u0014\n\u0014\nWoe to me, my mother, that you have borne me\u0014\nAs a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land!\u0014\nI have not lent, nor have men lent money to me,\u0014\nYet everyone curses me. (15:10)\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than once he questioned the justice of being born (cf. \n20:1415). No one seemed to listen to him, up to and beyond the fall \nof Jerusalem in 586 B.C. He was tempted to forsake his calling; he \naccused the Lord; he wrestled with doubt; his faith wavered. But in \nthe end he persevered. He opened his mouth and thundered.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah's hope\u0014\n\u0014\nWith provocative, graphic imagery, Jeremiah painted a picture of the \napproaching doom. When you read him, you can hear the executioner's \ndrumroll from the first chapter.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the dreadful day arrives it is reported in chapters 39 and \n52 with the dispassionate tone of an inventory clerk tallying the \ncasualties and plunder. There is no poetic expression of the great \ncalamity. It is possible that Jeremiah held back the torrent of \nemotion this tragedy required, and poured it all into a series of \nacrostic poems we know as Lamentations.\u0014\n\u0014\nLamentations is a hurricane of hopes dashed and horror's domination, \nand the eye of the storm is in chapter 3. But it is no placid calm; \nit is an arena. We are spectators to a mortal conflict; witnessing \nGiant Despair with all the power of darkness, palpable terror, \nheart-rending bereavement, deranging regret, and bewildering \nperplexity bearing down on the soul of a solitary believer. \nJeremiah's ears are saturated with the screams of the slaughtered, \nthe groans of the famished, and the wails of bereaved mothers. His \neyes are gorged with violence, murder, rape, and cannibalism. Giant \nDespair plants his foot on the prophet's neck and whispers, Behold \nthe real; God does not reward those who seek him; your soul will see \nno good.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so the weary prophet confesses:\u0014\n\u0014\nMy soul has been rejected from peace;\u0014\nI have forgotten happiness.\u0014\nSo I say, My strength has perished,\u0014\nAnd so has my hope from the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has no confidence that he may expect any good from the Lord, but \nbefore faith breathes its last he turns again to God:\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurely my soul remembers\u0014\nAnd is bowed down within me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he deliberately turns from remembering his circumstances to \nrecalling the character of God. He forces his mind away from the \nvisible to the eternal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis turning of his mind is the hinge from despair to hope, and the \ndefiant action we must take when we too are overcome by despair. As \ndawn rends the darkness to proclaim that day has returned, so hope \narises. Hope is resurrected to slay Giant Despair and shake the \nfoundations of Doubting Castle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis I recall to my mind,\u0014\nTherefore I have hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does he have hope? Because of the Lord's inexhaustible affection \nfor his own:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord's lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,\u0014\nFor His compassions never fail.\u0014\nThey are new every morning;\u0014\nGreat is Your faithfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stricken saint summons an ancient incantation to shatter the \ndeadly spell of Despair. It is a holy incantation, sung by \ngenerations; a celebration of the certainty that the Lord's affection \nfor his own is never depleted. What the NASB translates \nlovingkindness is the Lord's covenant love, His commitment, His loyal \nlove, His benevolent disposition toward those who fear Him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Jeremiah's first ground for hope is this eternal disposition of \nGod toward His people, and the second is an eternal possession. \nLamentations 3:24 continues,\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord is my portion, says my soul,\u0014\nTherefore I have hope in Him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur portion, our possession is the Maker of all things, if we have \nHim, we have everything. And we have Hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nFew Christians have evaded Giant Despair entirely. Some have been \nbadly mauled by a brutal encounter with him. Others have wasted away \nin Doubting Castle.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when our comforts cease and peace departs, if like Jeremiah we \nmeditate on the God whose inexhaustible affection is our eternal \npossessionthen we will have a key to open any door in Doubting \nCastle, and we will know the truth of Lamentations 3:25\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord is good to those who wait for Him,\u0014\nTo the person who seeks Him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Heimann is an engineer in the automotive industry.

    "title": "FIVE ERRORS TO DROP FROM YOUR EASTER SERMON",
    "words": "Five Errors to \nDrop From Your Easter Sermon\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you want to help people see Holy Week with fresh eyes, start by \ndropping these familiar fallacies. \u0014\n\u0014\nAndreas J. Kstenberger and Justin Taylor/ April 15, 2014 \nChristianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Don't say Jesus died when he was 33 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe common assertion seems reasonable that if Jesus \"began his \nministry\" when he \"was about thirty years of age\" (Luke 3:23) and \nengaged in a three-year ministry (John mentions three Passovers, and \nthere might have been a fourth one), then he was 33 years old at the \ntime of his death. However, virtually no scholar believes Jesus was \nactually 33 when he died. Jesus was born before Herod the Great \nissued the decree to execute \"all the male children in Bethlehem and \nin all that region who were two years old or under\" (Matt. 2:16, ESV) \nand before Herod died in the spring of 4 B.C. If Jesus was born in \nthe fall of 5 or 6 B.C., and if we remember that we don't count the \n\"0\" between B.C. and A.D., then Jesus would have been 37 or 38 years \nold when he died in the spring of A.D. 33 (as we believe is most \nlikely). Even if Jesus died in the year A.D. 30 (the only serious \nalternative date), he would have been 34 or 35, not 33 years old. No \nmajor doctrine is affected by this common misconception. But don't \ndamage your credibility by confidently proclaiming \"facts\" from the \npulpit that are not true.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Don't explain the apparent absence of a lamb at the Last Supper by \nonly saying Jesus is the ultimate Passover Lamb.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it is gloriously true that Jesus is \"the Lamb of God, who takes \naway the sin of the world\" (John 1:29), this does not mean there was \nno physical paschal lamb at the Lord's Supper. In fact, there almost \ncertainly was: \"Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the \nPassover lamb [pascha] had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and \nJohn, saying, 'Go and prepare the Passover [pascha] for us, that we \nmay eat it [i.e., the pascha]'\" (Luke 22:78; cf. Mark 14:12). Even \nif it isn't specifically mentioned in the Gospel accounts, eating the \npaschal lamb was an important part of every Jewish Passover (Ex. \n12:3). This is why the disciples ate the meal together as a group, at \nnight, within the city gates, where it would have been eaten with red \nwine and consumed before the breaking of bread and singing of a hymn. \nWhile there's disagreement about the nature of the Last Supper, we \nthink it's clear that Jesus celebrated Passover with the Twelve on \nthe night before the crucifixionwith Jesus making it clear that he \nsaw himself in the tradition of God's mighty deliverance of his \npeople Israel from bondage in Egypt by the blood of a sacrificial \nlamb.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Don't say the same crowds worshiped Jesus on Palm Sunday and then \ncried out for his crucifixion on Good Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of statement makes for a powerful sermon point to \nillustrate the fickleness of the human heart when it comes to Jesus \nthe Messiah. But a couple of qualifications need to be added. First, \nit is not entirely clear that the \"Hosanna!\" crowd acclaiming Jesus' \ntriumphal entry is the same group of people as the \"Crucify him!\" \ncrowd gathered before Pontius Pilate. The former seem to be mainly \npilgrims from Galilee along with Jesus's disciples, while the latter \nseem to be largely those from Jerusalem. Second, both crowds are \nexpressing passion based on misunderstanding. As Jesus rode into \nJerusalem on a donkey, the excitement of those proclaiming \"Hosanna!\" \nwas based on an erroneous nationalistic conception of the Messiah. \nAnd when Jesus stood with Pontius Pilate before the Jerusalem Jews, \nstirred up by their leaders who were falsely charging Jesus with \nblasphemy, their condemnation was likewise based on a misconception \nof the Messiah's identity. The common bond between both crowds is not \nthe fickleness of the human heart but the lack of genuine knowledge \nand worship of the humble Messiah and suffering Servant.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Don't bypass the role of the women as witnesses of the resurrected \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number and identity of the women in the resurrection accounts can \nbe difficult to untangle, which is one of the reasons why we provide \na glossary in The Final Days of Jesus as a guide. One of the \nconfusing things, for example, is that no less than four of the women \nshare the name Mary: (1) Mary Magdalene; (2) Mary the mother of \nJesus; (3) Mary the mother of James and Joses/Joseph; and (4) Mary \nthe wife of Clopas (who may have been the brother of Joseph of \nNazareth). In addition, there is Joanna (whose husband, Chuza, was \nthe household manager for Herod Antipas) and Salome (probably the \nmother of the apostles James and John).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs you preach this Easter, do not bypass the testimony of the women \nas an incidental detail. In the first century, women were not even \neligible to testify in a Jewish court of law. Josephus said that even \nthe witness of multiple women was not acceptable \"because of the \nlevity and boldness of their sex.\" Celsus, the second-century critic \nof Christianity, mocked the idea of Mary Magdalene as an alleged \nresurrection witness, referring to her as a \"hysterical female  \ndeluded by  sorcery.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis background matters because it points to two crucial truths. \nFirst, it is a theological reminder that the kingdom of the Messiah \nturns the system of the world on its head. In this culture, Jesus \nradically affirmed the full dignity of women and the vital value of \ntheir witness. Second, it is a powerful apologetic reminder of the \nhistorical accuracy of the resurrection accounts. If these were \n\"cleverly devised myths\" (2 Pet. 1:16, ESV), women would never have \nbeen presented as the first eyewitnesses of the risen Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Don't focus on the suffering of Jesus to the extent that you \nneglect the glory of the Cross in and through the Resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain Christian traditions tend to focus almost unilaterally on the \nsuffering of Jesus on the cross, on the incredible pain he had to \nendure, and on his humiliation and separation from God. This can be \nseen in cinematic depictions such as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the \nChrist, the Roman Catholic reenactment of his path to the crucifixion \non the Via Dolorosa (the Way of Sorrows) in the stations to the \nCross, and in quite a few sermons both of us have heard in the \nevangelical churches we attended (not to mention many of our favorite \nhymns). Of course, the four biblical Gospels, especially Matthew, \nMark, and Luke, concur that Jesus suffered a great deal for us as he \ngave his life for our salvation so that we could be forgiven of our \nsins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, there is another aspect to the Easter story. It is best \nencapsulated in John's statement that Jesus, when he \"knew that his \nhour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved \nhis own who were in the world  loved them to the end\" (13:1, ESV). \nWhen introducing not only the scene of the foot-washing, but his \nentire passion narrative, John writes the following: \"Jesus, knowing \nthat the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had \ncome from God and was going back to God, rose from supper\" (13:34; \ncf. 14:28).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, John is at pains to show that the Cross was not a \ndead end but a station on Jesus' way back home to the Father! This is \nwhy he strikes a triumphant note at the outset of narrating the \nCrucifixion: The Father had given all things into Jesus' hands, and \nJesus was on his way back to his pre-existent glory which he enjoyed \nwith the Father (17:5, 24)! It is, as the writer of Hebrews put it, \n\"for the joy that was set before him\" that Jesus \"endured the cross, \ndespising the shame\" (12:2). This Easter, let's make sure we don't \nleave out the \"glory\" part when we tell the story of Jesus' \nsuffering. No doubt, the Cross was glorious in and of itself in \ndisplaying Jesus' perfect obedience, God's love for humanity, and the \nGod-man's rendering of substitutionary atonement for sinners. Jesus' \nearthly work is indeed \"finished\" (John 19:30), but his glorious work \nof ruling, reigning, and interceding continues to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndreas Kstenberger is senior research professor of New Testament \nand Biblical Theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in \nWake Forest, North Carolina.

    "words": "Samuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and \nvery poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian! It is, however, for \"America,\" that \nSamuel Francis Smith is best remembered.\u0014",

    "words": "Feuerbach: a Theologian Who Wasn't\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Christianity is also the story of attacks on \nChristianity. On this day July 28, 1804 Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach was \nborn. His father was a well-known jurist who exerted tremendous \ninfluence in the field of German law. He was also a petty, moralizing \ntyrant at home who betrayed Feuerbach's mother for another man's \nwife. It has sometimes been remarked that the ranks of atheists are \nmost often joined by men who hate their fathers. Feuerbach, who had \nmuch reason to dislike his father, attacked Christianity mercilessly. \nLike his follower Marx, he adopted materialist presuppositions and \ntherefore considered his critique of the faith scientific. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a youth Feuerbach became deeply interested in religion and pored \nover Hebrew. He studied theology at Heidelberg and then won \npermission to transfer to Berlin. Because of his involvement in a \nstudent club he came under the suspicion of the police and was held \nup from becoming a professor. He was able to show he was involved in \nno secret organization. On this day July 28, 1824, his 20th birthday, \nhe was admitted to the theology faculty. He had, however, already \nbecome a follower of Hegel. He would never teach theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first move was to transfer to the philosophy department. \nFinancial difficulties led him to relocate to Erlanger where he \nlectured on philosophy for many years as a private lecturer. His \nfirst lecture attacked Christianity. By 1830 he had issued \nanonymously a book titled Thoughts on Death and Immortality. He wrote \nmockingly that religion was \"merely a kind of insurance company.\" His \nauthorship became known and it barred him from advancement. \nFeuerbach's father was appalled. Believe such things privately, but \ndo not ruin your career by openly flaunting public opinion, he \nadvised.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeuerbach's response was to issue his Essence of Christianity. In \nthis and his other works he declared religion a fantasy--an attempt \nat wish-fulfillment. \"The more empty life is, the more concrete is \nGod...Only the poor man has a rich God.\" He argued that man wants to \nbe a god with godlike powers; because he cannot have these powers, he \ndreams up a god who does. Practical men, however, turn to science and \ntechnology which can satisfy real needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat would Feuerbach have thought of the life of his fellow-German \nGeorge Mller, who proved the practicality of faith, scientifically \nrecording every prayer and its answer? Feuerbach saw religion \nemerging from the feeling of dependence. Mller learned to come to \nGod in Christ's name for every need.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeuerbach's idea prospered for a decade. The Essence of Christianity \nwent through eleven printings. After the failed revolution of 1848 it \nfaded into virtual oblivion, though not without influencing Wagner \nand Nietzsche. George Eliot translated his work into English. Ernest \nRenan, who himself tried to \"demythologize\" the life of Christ, \ndescribed Feuerbach as antichrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nKamenka, Eugene.

I grew \nup in a typical conservative Baptist church and I was taught that one \nwould be judged on the basis of whether or not one believes in Jesus \nas Savior, but that is not what the gospels teach. In every single \njudgment text in Matthew, Mark, and Luke participants in Gods \nkingdom are not identified by what they believe, but by what they do. \nThis emphasis is found in Johns Gospel as well (see especially John \n5:28-29; to believe in Johns Gospel includes the idea of being \nfaithful to the love command of Jesus).

    "words": "Four of a Kind  Rick Riley, \nSports Illustrated, 9/24/01\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   THE HUGE rugby player, the former high school football star and \nthe onetime college baseball player were in first class, the former \nnational judo champ was in coach. On the morning of Sept. 11, at \n32,000 feet, those four men teamed up to sacrifice their lives for \nthose of perhaps thousands of others.\u0014\n\u0014\n Probably about an hour into United Flight 93's scheduled trip from \nNewark to San Francisco, the 38 passengers aboard the Boeing 757 \nrealized they were being hijacked. The terrorists commandeered the \ncockpit, and the passengers were herded to the back of the plane.\u0014\n\u0014\n Shoved together were four remarkable men who didn't much like being \nshoved around. One was publicist Mark Bingham, 31, who helped Cal win \nthe 1991 and '93 national collegiate rugby championships. Re was a \nsurfer, and in July he was carried on the horns of a bull in \nPamplona. Six-foot-five, rowdy and fearless, he once wrestled a gun \nfrom a mugger's hand late at night on a San Francisco street.\u0014\n\u0014\n One was medical research company executive Tom Burnett, 38, the \nstandout quarterback for Jefferson High in Bloomington, Minn., when \nthe team went to the division championship game in 1980. That team \nrallied around Burnett every time it was in trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\n One was businessman Jeremy Glick, 31, 6' 2\" and muscular, the 1993 \ncollegiate judo champ in the 220-pound class from the University of \nRochester (N.Y.), a national-caliber wrestler at Saddle River (N.J.) \nDay School and an all-state soccer player. \"As long as I've known \nhim,\" says his wife, Lyz, \"he was the kind of man who never tried to \nbe the hero-but always was.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n One was 32-year-old sales account manager Todd Beamer, who played \nmostly third base and shortstop in three seasons for Wheaton (Ill.) \nCollege.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The rugby player picked up an AirFone and called his mother, \nAlice Hoglan, in Sacramento to tell her he loved her. The judo champ \ncalled Lyz at her parents' house in Windham, N.Y., to say goodbye to \nher and their 12-week-old daughter, Emmy. But in the calls the \nquarterback made to his wife, Deena, in San Ramon, Calif., and in the \nconversation the baseball player had with a GTE operator, the men \nmade it clear that they'd found out that two other hijacked planes \nhad cleaved the World Trade Center towers.\u0014\n\u0014\n       The pieces of the puzzle started to fit. Somewhere near \nCleveland the passengers on Flight 93 had felt the plane take a hard \nturn south. They were now on course for Washington, D.C. Senator \nArlen Specter (R., Pa.) believes the plane might have been headed for \nthe Capitol. Beamer, Bingham, Burnett and Glick must have realized \ntheir jet was a guided missile.\u0014\n\u0014\n The four apparently came up with a plan. Burnett told his wife, \"I \nknow we're going to die. Some of us are going to do something about \nit.\" He wanted to rush the hijackers.\u0014\n\u0014\n Nobody alive is sure about what happened next, but there's good \nreason to believe that the four stormed the cockpit. Flight 93 never \nmade it to Washington. Instead, it dived into a field 80 miles \nsoutheast of Pittsburgh. All passengers and crew perished. Nobody on \nthe ground was killed.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In the heart of San Francisco's largest gay neighborhood, a \nmakeshift memorial grew, bouquet by bouquet, to the rugby player who \nwas unafraid. Yeah, Bingham was gay.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In Windham, a peace grew inside Lyz Glick. \"I think God had this \nlarger purpose for him,\" she said. \"He was supposed to fly out the \nnight before, but couldn't. I had Emmy one month early, so Jeremy got \nto see her. You can't tell me God isn't at work there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Cranbury, N.J., a baby grew in Lisa Beamer, Todd's wife, their \nthird child. Hearing the report last Friday of her husband's heroics, \nLisa said, \"made my life worth living again.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n  In Washington, a movement grew in Congress to give the four men the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian can \nreceive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a time like this, sports are trivial. But what the best athletes \ncan do--keep their composure amid chaos, form a plan when all seems \nlost and find the guts to carry it out--may be why the Capitol isn't \na charcoal pit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy 26-year-old niece, Jessica Robinson, works for Congressman Lane \nEvans (D., Ill.). Jessica was in the Capitol that morning. This \nChristmas I'll get to see her smiling face.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm glad there were four guys up there I could count on.\u0014",

    "title": "FREDERICK DOUGLASS, AMERICA'S PROPHET",
    "words": "February 14, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nToday is the bicentennial of the birth of Frederick Douglass. Born a \nslave in 1818 on Marylands Eastern Shore, Douglass escaped slavery \nin 1838, fleeing to New York but eventually settling in \nMassachusetts. Three years later, he began his lifelong work as an \nabolitionist and civil rights activist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many excellent biographies of Douglass, including three \nautobiographical works. D. H. Dilbecks Frederick Douglass is \nvaluable because it is a religious biography, the goal of which is \nto explain the substance of Douglasss faith and show how it shaped \nhis public career. In Dilbecks judgment, Douglass was the most \nsignificant spokesman of his day for black prophetic Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis prophetic Christianity involved both judgment and hope. \nThroughout his long public career, Dilbeck writes, Douglass \nardently denounced slavery, racism, and bigotry in all its forms. \nHis opposition to slavery and Jim Crow are well known, but Dilbeck \nreminds readers that Douglass was an early advocate of womens \nsuffrage, as well as the rights of Chinese immigrants.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven so, Dilbeck writes, if Douglass pursued any single calling that \ntied together his entire life, it was simply to force Americans to \nconfront the disjuncture between the Christianity they professed and \npracticed and the Christianity of Christ. White Southern \nChristianity drew particular scorn from Douglass throughout his life, \nfor its defense of white supremacy and the practices of first \nslavery, then Jim Crow. But he also critiqued Northern Christian \ncomplicity and Black Church passivity in the face of injustice.\u0014\n\u0014\nDouglass had an evangelical conversion in his teens, and he never \nrepudiated the Christian faith, which in fact undergirded his civil \nrights activism. But the injustice, complicity and passivity of \nChristian churches led Douglass away from formal affiliation with any \ncongregation or denomination. It also led him to criticize churches \nthat cultivated doctrinal orthodoxy and personal piety, but never \nengaged in struggle against the great injustices of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Douglass death, Christian Recorder, the leading black \nMethodist newspaper, summarized his understanding of Christianity \nthis way:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"His religion was not a religion of creeds, churches, hymnals and \nprayer books, but he believed in precept, the life and practice as \ntaught by the Master of doing unto others as we would have others to \ndo unto us. It was the cups of cold water in His name, feed the \nhungry, clothe the naked, not in professions of church phraseology \nand beautiful song, but in the example with love to our fellows and \nour neighbors as ourselves, which, after all, is the greatest and \nonly evidence of our love to God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, alongside the prophetic judgment, there was prophetic hope. \nThroughout his career, Douglass held the settled conviction that God \nwas on the side of justice; therefore, justice would ultimately \nprevail. I recognize an arm stronger than any human arm, he told an \n1853 American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society meeting, and an \nintelligence higher than any human intelligence, guarding and guiding \nthis Anti-Slavery cause, through all the dangers and perils that \nbeset it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine providence did not excuse human beings from taking action, \nhowever. Waldo Martin argued in The Mind of Frederick Douglass that \nby the time of the Civil War, Douglass had replaced his traditional \nGod-centered religious philosophy with a liberal human-centered \nreligious philosophy. Dilbeck disagrees. He explains:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"the apparent changes in Douglasss later theology had less to do \nwith some new understanding of God and far more to do instead with \nthe new social and political challenges confronting African Americans \nafter emancipation. Douglass feared that a certain passive spirit \nmight spread among African Americans, especially slaves, if they \nembraced too-simplistic notions of providence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord is good and kind, as Douglass put it in 1893, but of most \nuse to those who do for themselves (emphasis in original).\u0014\n\u0014\nDouglass optimism in the postbellum Reconstruction period  with the \nabolition of slavery and the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth \nand Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution  was tempered in \nthe post-Reconstruction period because of the recrudescence in the \nSouth of the power of white supremacy, which expressed itself by \ndisenfranchising black voters, segregating Southern society and \nlynching black males.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have seen dark hours in my life, Douglass said in an October 1890 \nspeech. He had just outlined the injustices mentioned above. Yet, he \nwent on to say: I have seen the darkness gradually disappearing and \nthe light gradually increasing. Most importantly, I remember that \nGod reigns in eternity, and that whatever delays, whatever \ndisappointments and discouragements may come, truth, justice, \nliberty, and humanity will ultimately prevail.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is easy, more than 100 years after Douglass death, to lionize the \nman, and there is good reason to do so. He was right on fundamental \nissues of justice and equality, when so many Christians in his day \nwere wrong. That is a historical fact that all now acknowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Christian reader, though, I cannot help but think that D. H. \nDilbecks religious biography poses an implicit challenge to American \nChristians today: Are we in fact on Gods side? Are we working to \nensure that truth, justice, liberty, and humanity will prevail? \nThat is, it seems to me, an open question.\u0014",

    "title": "FOUR BIBLICAL THEMES THAT EXPLAIN MODERN ISRAEL",
    "words": "Four biblical themes \nthat explain modern-day Israel\u0014\nWritten by a right wing viewer of the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn, historian Daniel \nGordis describes Israel as a story of a homeless people that kept a \ndream alive for millennia, of a peoples redemption from the edge of \nthe abyss, of a nation forging a future where none seemed possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordis traces several biblical themes that converged in the creation \nof modern-day Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne: The importance of the Promised Land.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordis notes, There could be no Jewish nation, and no Jewish family, \ntheir diary [the Bible] intimated, without their land at the center \nof the story. He adds, Genesis is fundamentally the story of \nAbrahams complex family, but central to that story is the land on \nwhich they have been told to live.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo: The need for courage\u0014\n.\u0014\nThe Zionists understood from Scripture that the road to true freedom \nwould be long and difficult. In the book of Joshua, the people had \nto cross a flooded river. Canaan was occupied by seven different \nnations. Wars were frequent, and the land was seldom without conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree: The danger of disunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the Jews established themselves in Canaan, they faced constant \nthreats from their enemies near and far. When they divided into \nNorthern and Southern Kingdoms, they fell captive to the Assyrians \nand then the Babylonians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour: The call of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish Bible (what we call the Old Testament) is arranged so that \nits last book is not Malachi but 2 Chronicles. As a result, Gordis \nnotes, The Jews national story that had opened with God telling \nAbram to go to the place that I will show you (the Land of \nIsrael)concludes with the Bibles very last words, Let him go up \n[to Jerusalem]' (2 Chronicles 36:23).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the secret of his immortality?\u0014\n\u0014\n learned from their biblical ancestors the importance of trusting \nGods promises, serving him with courage, living in unity, and \nfulfilling Gods call by faith. After more than twenty trips to \nIsrael, I can testify that these values still animate these \nremarkable people.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks: Jews are a famously \naccomplished group. They make up 0.2 percent of the world population, \nbut 54 percent of the world chess champions, 27 percent of the Nobel \nphysics laureates and 31 percent of the medicine laureates.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty years before the birth of the modern State of Israel, Mark \nTwain wrote an extraordinary essay for Harpers Magazine on the \nJewish people. He concluded:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the \nplanet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed \naway; the Greek and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and \nthey are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high \nfor a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have \nvanished.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, \nexhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his \nparts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and \naggressive mind. All things are mortal but the Jew; all other forces \npass, but he remains. What is the secret of his immortality?\u0014\n\u0014\nPray for the peace of Jerusalem\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this historic day, how does Scripture answer Mark Twains question?\u0014\n\u0014\nI am convinced that God is still using the Jewish people. Whatever \nour position regarding Israel and prophecy, we should acknowledge \nthat God made the children of Abraham into a great nation. And that \nthrough them all the families of the earth shall be blessed \n(Genesis 12:2, 3).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNow God is calling us to love the Jewish people as he does.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul said of his fellow Jews, Brothers, my hearts desire and prayer \nto God for them is that they may be saved (Romans 10:1). Standing \nbefore the Jewish supreme council, Peter said of Jesus, There is \nsalvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven \ngiven among men by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord wants the Jewish people to make Jesus their Messiah, that \nthey might know God as their Father and Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nScripture teaches that our Lord loves the Arab people as well. He \nsaid of Ishmael, the ancestor of the Arabs, I will make him into a \ngreat nation (Genesis 17:20). In fact, God loves all nations and \nanticipates the day when people from all tribes and peoples and \nlanguages are gathered with him in heaven (Revelation 7:9).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this historic day, would you take a moment to pray for the peace \nof Jerusalem (Psalm 122:6)? Would you pray for a day when Jews, \nArabs, and all other peoples make the Prince of Peace their Lord?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he called for a Jewish state fifty years before the rebirth of \nIsrael, Theodor Herzl assured his people, If you will it, it is no \ndream. He was right.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPublication date: May 14, 2018\u0014",

    "title": "FOUR THINGS MASTER LIARS DO",
    "words": "4 things that master liars do (and how to spot them)\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bruce Roselle  \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a leader at any level across a wide variety of organizations, you \nlikely will run into a direct report, peer, customer, or other who \nappears to be stretching the truth or outright lying.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are like me, you struggle at times to discern what is truth \nand what is fiction in their story.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, I had the experience of meeting and trying to help someone \non the streets of Minneapolis; that interaction helped shed light on \nthis question. I will call him Big Roy.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a drug dealer and user, and my wife, a couple of friends and I \nbefriended him as part of an outreach in the inner city.\u0014\n\u0014\nWarm, personable, and friendly, Big Roy was quite the opposite of the \nkind of person I thought I would encounter hanging out at 10 p.m. on \nthe street. After our first meeting, in which we talked with him for \nabout an hour, we met him on several more occasions where we talked, \nlaughed, cried, prayed, and shared food with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nToward the end of the first week of our interaction with Big Roy, we \nbegan to be a bit suspicious about whether the stories he told us \nwere true. We wanted to be trusting and loving with this guy, and he \nconvinced us that he earnestly desired to turn his life around and \nwork a legitimate job maybe as an addiction counselor, or even a \npastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, after more than a week, we began to talk with others we had \nbegun to identify  family members, case workers, staff  who had \nknown Big Roy for many years. Their stories came into stark contrast \nwith his stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I gently but directly confronted Big Roy about the \ninconsistencies in his stories, he became angry and belligerent, \ndemanding to know who I had talked with and who had authorized me to \ncall his sister.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats when I simply shook his hand, wished him good luck, and parted \ncompany with Big Roy. It was clear that he had been masterfully lying \nthe whole time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my four decades of coaching and counseling experience, I had never \nmet someone who could lie with such a straight face, cry with real \ntears in a way that feigned brokenness, and manipulate people so \nsmoothly to get what he wanted from them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI decided to share what I learned from my brief but intense \nrelationship with Big Roy by focusing on what I discovered about \npeople who lie. My hope is that this perspective from someone who is \na master liar will help you spot less adept liars you run into as a \npart of your work and personal lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat really adept liars do to get their needs met.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are four things master liars do:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Obfuscate the lies with truth\u0014\nInstead of spinning a yarn that is totally false, they interweave \ncomponents of truth with lies. This way, they keep you guessing which \npieces are true and which are false.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey make vague statements that can be easily misunderstood and \neasily denied later when you question them. Oh, I didnt say that, I \nsaid this, or, picking out a piece that actually was true, This IS \ntrue, its exactly what I said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes they will bring in other people to corroborate their \nstories, but these people will only know about part of the story, and \nthe liar then uses this true piece to validate the whole story.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Foster gratitude\u0014\nTo soften your heart, they will do something or take some action that \nis, or appears to be, genuinely altruistic and aimed at helping those \nthey are manipulating. It might be a small gesture, something that \nshows they care about you or are looking out for your best interests, \nwith no thought to their own safety or benefit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Big Roys case, he very assertively escorted us off the street \nthat first night and into our car, explaining later that some gang \nmembers had arrived and we were no longer safe.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Win you over with their charm\u0014\nYou are more likely to believe a liar if they stay friendly and \nupbeat, even when you begin to question their veracity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf liars engage you in such a way that you develop a genuine liking \nand compassion for them, then it becomes more difficult for you to \nask the tough questions and become skeptical of the liars words and \nactions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBig Roy shared stories about his kids, showed genuine interest in our \nfamilies, joked with waitresses when we took him out to eat, and \nexpressed gratitude for all we were doing for him.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Feign a genuine heart change\u0014\nThe crowning achievement for a liar is to get you to believe that \nthey are genuinely sorry for their past actions and words, that they \nare truly repentant and broken about what they have done in the past, \nand that they have done a complete turnaround because of your \ninterest in them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis takes an actor or actress of sociopathic proportions, one who \ncan cry real tears of remorse, sadness, pain, or happiness when \ntelling whopping lies.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, my wife and friends agreed with me that his real calling \nwas not drug dealer, addiction counselor, or pastor, but actor.\u0014",

    "words": "Francis Grimke's Christian Critique of Slavery\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis J. Grimk was the son of wealthy Henry Grimk, a white \nplanter, and Nancy Weston, a black slave. He was born in 1850 at \nCaneacres, a rice plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. His \nwhite aunts were Quaker abolitionists, the most notable of whom was \nAngelina.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Henry Grimk died in 1852, his will freed Francis and placed him \nunder the guardianship of his white half-brother, Montague. Eight \nyears later, when Montague threatened to enslave Francis, who was now \nten years old, he fled and served as valet to a Confederate officer. \nWhen Grimk visited Charleston some months later, Montague seized and \nimprisoned him. Francis became ill and would have died had his mother \nnot been allowed to nurse him. Before he was completely well again, \nhis brother Montague sold him to another officer. But at the end of \nthe war, Francis was emancipated with other African-Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimk now acknowledged Francis' \nrelationship to them and various individuals gave him financial aid \nto attend Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Later, feeling drawn to \nthe ministry, he entered Princeton Theological Seminary from which he \ngraduated in 1878.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 7, 1878, Francis was ordained as a Presbyterian \nminister. He would spend over fifty years in the pulpit, most of it \nat Washington's 15th Street Presbyterian Church. He was noted as one \nof the most articulate opponents of racism: \"Race prejudice can't be \ntalked down, it must be lived down.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was convinced that if Blacks put their trust in God, He would \nstrengthen them as he strengthened the Israelites. \"The race that \nputs its trust in God has always, under all circumstances, more for \nit than against it.\" One of Grimk's strongest arguments for equality \nwas this: \"Another great principle of the religion of Jesus Christ \nis, that all Christians are one in him--together they constitute one \nfamily.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLike his contemporary Booker T. Washington, the educator of Tuskegee, \nGrimk emphasized honesty, hard work, thrift and eternal values, \ndenouncing loose sexual morals. \"It is only what is written upon the \nsoul of man that will survive the wreck of time,\" he said. However, \nwhen Grimk perceived Booker T. Washington was going soft on civil \nrights, he sided with the more radical and socialistic W. E. B. \nDubois and helped bring into existence the NAACP. He also helped \nfound the American Negro Academy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAfrican American Registry. \nhttp://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1210/\u0014\nGrimk, Francis J. \"A Resemblance and a Contrast; sermon delivered \nOctober 12th, 1902,\" in American Sermons; the Pilgrims to Martin \nLuther King, jr.

He \nclaimed all Christians are priests, rejected rote repetition of the \nLords Prayer, and denied the efficacy of outward works for \nsalvation. He claimed that Christ on the cross suffered more from \nGods judgment than from the physical torture.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther charges, if not merely the accusers reductio ad absurdum of \nMartin's views, were more serious.

    "words": "Feminine Revolt: 11 Demand Ordination\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010    3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nEleven women, with the connivance of four bishops, determined to \nsmash the barriers of \"sexism\" in the Episcopal church on this day \nJuly 29, 1974. Fifteen hundred people crowded the sanctuary of the \nEpiscopal Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia to witness this \nconfrontation with church rules and authority. A banner shouted \nPaul's words: \"In Christ there is neither male nor female.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Corrigan asked if there was any known impediment to ordination \nof the eleven. \"Yes,\" shouted several. Five priests stepped forward \nto take the microphones. What was about to be done was illegal and \ndivisive they said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey could not state all the reasons for their view. For much of \nchurch history, women were barred from ordination. The reasons were \nmany. Women held chattel-like status throughout much of history. \nTheir parental and nurturing roles often made it impractical for them \nto be active as leaders. Many men were (and are) reluctant to accept \ninstruction from women.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Old Testament Passover laws, only males had to be redeemed and \nonly male animals could redeem them. Only males were allowed to serve \nas priests offering the sacrifice. Christ, both priest and sacrifice, \ncame as a man. He is the very masculine bridegroom of the church. He \nselected only men as apostles. Paul taught that women were not to \nteach men in a public church setting. Women are subordinate to men in \nthe same way that the church is subordinate to Christ, he wrote. He \nargued that Eve had disobeyed first and brought Adam into \ndisobedience. Peter taught that wives were to be subject to their \nhusbands as Sarah had been to Abraham.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, Christ had not spurned women. They were the first \nbearers of the news that he was raised from the dead. Indeed, he may \nbe seen as the one who more than any other in history raised the \nstatus of women. With the Reformation and with the emancipation of \nwomen that followed, roles began to change. Sects increasingly gave \nwomen new responsibility. Some, while refusing to allow women to \npreach in formal services, thought it fine if, like the women who \nrushed from the tomb to tell Peter the Lord was risen, they were \nallowed to informally convey the gospel. Ordination remained largely \ntaboo to women until small Protestant denominations began to grant \nit. Technological and medical changes also made it easier for women \nto assume such roles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Episcopalian ordination ceremony proceeded despite opposition. \nThe eleven women became priests and offered the cup and bread. But \nsoon afterward the procedure was annulled by higher authorities. Too \nmany rules had been broken. Three of the bishops were retired men and \nnot permitted to ordain without express approval. The other bishop \nwas out of his jurisdiction. Furthermore, none of the women had been \napproved by their local bishops as is required by Episcopal law. \nToday a number of Christian denominations still refuse to ordain \nwomen. Chief among them is the Roman Catholic church. The subject \nremains one of the most controversial in some church bodies both at \nthe local and national levels.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen have now been approved for ordination by the Episcopal Church \nand many have been.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nNewsweek, August 12, 1974.\u0014\nGross, Ernie.

    "words": "PIRMIN PROVIDED THE FIRST RECORD OF THE FULL APOSTLES CREED\u0014\n \u0014\nThe most famous and widely used creed of the modern church is the \nApostles Creed. Although similar creeds arose early in the history \nof Christianity, the first complete record of the Apostles Creed, as \nwe know it, appeared in the second decade of the eighth century. St. \nPirmin recorded it in Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris \ncanonicis scarapsus, the textbook he used to train monks or young \nChristians. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book, written in crude Latin, presented learners with Christian \nteaching about creation, human purpose, sin, and the cross. It lists \nlust, gluttony, fornication, wrath, despair, recklessness, vainglory, \nand pride as the eight fundamental sins and it warns against sins of \nthe flesh such as fornication, covetousness, lying, sorcery, and \ndivorce. Christians were told to follow Christ and avoid such sins. \nThe meaning of scarapsus is not clear, but scholars suppose it is a \ncorruption of excerptus. If so, its awkward title might be translated \nRemarks of Abbot Pirminius, Excerpts from the Single Canonical Books. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Latin creed Pirmin gave was:\u0014\n\u0014\nCredo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae.\u0014\nEt in Iesum Christum, Filium Eius unicum, Dominum nostrum,\u0014\nqui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine,\u0014\npassus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus,\u0014\ndescendit ad inferos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis,\u0014\nascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Patris omnipotentis,\u0014\ninde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos.\u0014\nCredo in Spiritum Sanctum,\u0014\nsanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem,\u0014\nremissionem peccatorum,\u0014\ncarnis resurrectionem,\u0014\nvitam aeternam.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English translation of the Apostles Creed reads:\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And \nin Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord: Who was conceived \nby the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius \nPilate; was crucified, dead and buried: He descended into hell: The \nthird day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, and \nsits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he \nshall come to judge the quick and the dead: I believe in the Holy \nGhost: I believe in the holy catholic church: the communion of \nsaints: The forgiveness of sins: The resurrection of the body: And \nthe life everlasting. Amen.\u0014\nExcept for the statement He descended into hell, all of its \nassertions are found in the earlier creeds. However, that clause has \nas much right as any other to appear in a statement of Christian \nbelief because it is based on explicit Scripture, although many other \nScriptural doctrines of importance never made their way into the \ncreed. Pirmin wrote that each of the original apostles provided one \nof the statements of the creed. This legend was accepted for \ncenturies. However, studies of the creed show its present form \ndeveloped more gradually after the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nPirmin, born around 676, was a foreigner to Germany, but whether he \nwas a native of Lorraine or from England or Ireland is disputed. \nAfter obtaining some education, he became a bishop near Meaux. From \nthere he went as a missionary into southern Germany where he \nconverted many pagans and founded numerous Benedictine monasteries \nand reformed others. His most famous monastery was at Reichenau, but \nan uprising by the Alemanni against Charles Martel forced Pirmin to \nleave there. The last abbey he founded was Hornbach at the confluence \nof two rivers. According to tradition, Pirmin died at Hornbach on \nthis day, 3 November 753. His work ended a few years before the rise \nof Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance with its improvements \nin education. \u0014\n\u0014\nPirmins Latin may have been rough, but his creed remains an \nimportant marker in placing the development of the received text \n(textus receptus) of the Apostles Creed.\u0014",

Feast Day of France's Famous Bishop, Martin of \nTours\u0014\n \u0014\nMARTIN OF TOURS is one of the most famous fourth-century Christians. \nThe son of a military tribune, he was born around 316. His parents \nwere pagans who seemed to have moved to Italy when he was about nine. \nOver the objections of his parents, Martin prepared for baptism. He \nwas thrilled to hear the stories of Christian martyrs and monks. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn imperial edict required the sons of veterans to join the army. \nAlthough he was not quite sixteenthe minimum agehis father \ncompelled Martin to enlist. Martin kept completely free from those \nvices in which that class of men become too frequently involved, \nwrote his disciple Sulpitius Severus. He donated most of his pay to \ncharity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe best-known instance of Martins charity came during a severe \nwinter, in which extreme cold was proving fatal to many. A poor man \nat the gate of Amiens was ill-clothed. Martin recognized that a \nbeing to whom others showed no pity, was, in that respect, left to \nhim. Martin had already parted with all of his spare garments to \nhelp the poor and needed his cloak himself. Taking his sword, he \ndivided it into two equal parts, giving half to the poor man. That \nnight, Martin had a vision in which Jesus, wrapped in the beggars \npiece said, Martin, who is still but a catechumen [one preparing for \nbaptism], clothed me with this robe. \u0014\n\u0014\nMartin recognized both praise and censure in Christs words. Why was \nhe not yet baptized? He hurried to fulfill that Christian obligation. \nSoon afterward, he requested emperor Julius Constans to release him \nfrom military service. The emperor accused him of cowardice because a \nbattle was impending, but that night the enemy sued for peace and \nMartin got his discharge. \u0014\n\u0014\nMartin studied under Bishop Hilary and lived as a hermit, emerging \nfrom solitude only to preach. Traveling to seek the conversion of his \nparents, he was captured by bandits, but won one of his captors over \nto Christ and the man released him. Martins mother became a \nChristian during that visit, but his father held out until later. \nMartin returned to Gaul where he built some of its first monasteries \nand impressed many with his holy life and miracles. \u0014\n\u0014\nAround 371, the people of Tours lured him to their city with a plea \nthat he come pray over a sick woman. As soon as he entered the town, \nthey surrounded him and made him Bishop by force. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a bishop, Martin never lost his warm sympathy for suffering \npeople. While he preached the gospel, he also assisted the needy and \nchampioned political freedom. Excessive taxation had crushed the \nmiddle class in the Roman empire. Many were forced into slavery. \nMartin took the side of the people against the rulers and offered \nasylum to fugitives. He probably acted as Defensor for Tours, an \nadvocacy position created by the empire. His monasteries provided \nsecurity to many who were otherwise crushed by meaningless \noppression. All this made him highly popular. \u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of churches and places are named for Martin and the church \nhonors him with a feast on this day 11 November.

    "title": "FOR HIS DISSENT, DELAUNE STARVED TO DEATH",
    "words": "FOR DARING TO DISSENT, DELAUNE STARVED TO DEATH\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1683, Dr. Benjamin Calamy preached a sermon, which he afterward \npublished under the title of A Discourse about a Scrupulous \nConscience, of which we may truly say, that never any piece of its \nkind or size, gained more credit to its author, or was more taken \nnotice of by the publick, wrote Andrew Kippis in his Biographia \nBritannica. This sermon he preached a second time at Bow Church with \ngreat effect, and this excited a zealous Nonconformist, one Mr Thomas \nDe Laune, who had been formerly a schoolmaster, to write against it . \n. . .\u0014\n\u0014\nDe Laune titled his reply \"A Plea for the Nonconformists\" in a Letter \nto Dr. Benjamin Calamy, Upon His Sermon Called \"Scrupulous \nConscience.\" Calamy had appealed to reason, noted De Laune, and so, \nafter months examining the positions of both nonconformists and \nChurch of England theologians, he gave reasons why nonconformists \n(also known as dissenters) objected to certain practices of the \nestablished church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe observed that when imposing religious practices, kings and \nprelates said they could do so because they were matters of \nindifference that is, neither commanded by nor forbidden by \nScripture. However, when dissenters rejected these matters of \nindifference, they could expect severe treatment, showing that \nthese practices were not so indifferent after all. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a matter of fact, those objecting to Church of England practices \ncould be met with imprisonment, confiscation of property, and even \ndeath. The government's rationale was that to oppose a practice \nordered by the king was sedition and to write against a practice \nimposed by royal authority was libel.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs could be expected, when De Laune published his reply, he was \narrested and charged with libel. On this day, 29 November 1683, he \nwas thrown into a crowded space with rough, common prisoners. He \nsuffered greatly. When his case was heard, the judge fined him one \nhundred marks, or seventy-five pounds (USD $20,000 in 2020). Not \nhaving that kind of money, he was sent to Newgate Prison where he was \nimprisoned with felons. Later he was moved to a more respectable part \nof the prison. Prisons then fed their charges only if they paid. With \nno way to earn an income, De Laune was dependent on the gifts of \nvisitors.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this desperate situation, De Laune appealed to Dr. Calamy for \nhelp. He had written his Plea for the Nonconformists in response to \nCalamys call for reason, he said. Now he recounted his sufferings \nand pointed out the inequity of their positions in any argument. \nSir, you know that 'tis unequal to gag the Respondent, when the \nopponents mouth is at liberty nor to manacle the assaulted, when the \nchallenger flourishes a menacing sword. Calamy, who did not consider \nhimself in any way responsible for De Launes situation, made no \neffort to extricate him from prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nDe Launes situation rapidly deteriorated. His wife and two children \ncame to live with him in debtors prison. Starving and sickened by \nthe foul air, they died. De Laune had borne his sufferings pretty \nwell to this point, but now lost heart. A few months later, in 1685 \nhe, too, died, having been imprisoned fifteen months. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Baptists used De Launes Plea to support their dissenting \nposition and it went through several editions. Daniel Defoe, the \nfamous author of Robinson Crusoe, wrote the preface to the 1706 \nedition. As Defoe had also suffered for his religious convictions and \nfor indebtedness, De Launes story stuck a sympathetic chord in him. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe treatment the reverend and learned author of this book met with, \nwill forever stand as a monument to the cruelty of those times, he \nwrote. But Defoe pointed out that De Laune was only one of about \n8,000 dissenters who perished in prison or on the scaffold during the \nreign of King Charles II. I cannot refrain saying, such a champion \nof such a cause deserved better usage, and it was very, very hard \nsuch a man, such a Christian, such a scholar, and on such an \noccasion, should starve in a dungeon, and the whole body of \ndissenters in England, whose cause he died for defending, should not \nraise him 66, 13s 4p to save his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Francis of Assisi Contrived a Memorable Christmas Eve\u0014\n \u0014\nFRANCIS OF ASSISI, the joyous founder of the Franciscans, was nearing \nthe end of his life, but he proved to be still capable of surprises. \nOne of them occurred on this day, 24 December, 1223. \u0014\n\u0014\nGiovanni da Vellita, his wealthy admirer, had constructed a rough \nhermitage for the Franciscans at Greccio, Italy. Its simplicity \nsuited Francis fine; he never wanted anything sumptuous. Greccio was \ncharming, and the hermitage overlooked a valley with a view of \ndistant mountains. It was built in front of some caves with woods \nabove and below. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis invited his peasant neighbors and all nearby friars to join \nhim for a Christmas Eve mass here. They came with torches in their \nhands, singing Christmas hymns. Not until they climbed the steep \npaths did they learn that Francis had arranged for Giovanni to \nprovide a manger in one of the caves. Grouped around it were an ox \nand a donkey, with a man and woman in costume to represent Joseph and \nMary and a wax doll for Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen everyone had gathered, Francis chanted the Gospel account of \nChrists birth. Then he preached a sermon, recalling the events that \nhad taken place twelve centuries before in Judea. He promised his \nlisteners changed lives if they would place their faith in Christ, \nthe babe of Bethlehem. Many were touched with his tender retelling of \nthose events, the more so as the arrangement of people and animals \nlent verisimilitude to the old story. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, living mangers are fairly common, but Franciss seems to have \nbeen the first. In fact, he had to get permission from the pope for \nthe arrangement, lest he be accused of taking the story of Christs \nbirth lightly.\u0014\n \u0014\nA memorable Christmas Eve it must have been for the adults and \nchildren present as the group worshipped in lamp-light, recalling the \nbirth of Christ. Francis remained in vigil with Giovanni over the \nmanger all night long.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

Death has robbed this denomination of its \nrichest gem in the person of our deceased brother, whose influence is \nfelt like a mantle of love from rice swamps of the south to the bleak \ncoasts of New England, observed B.

His parents were free, an \nAfrican-American father and Cherokee mother. They moved to Ohio when \nCain was six. As a teenager, he worked on a steamboat. He converted \nto Christianity in 1841 when he was sixteen. Immediately he became a \nsoul-winner although he stayed with the steamboat crew for three more \nyears. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen he joined the AME, soon becoming a pastor although he had little \nformal education. Recognizing his need for more knowledge, he \nenrolled in Wilberforce College, where he studied for a year. When \nthe Civil War broke out, he attempted to volunteer, but was rejected \nas were many African Americans. Following the war, the AME sent him \nas a missionary to freedmen in Charleston, South Carolina.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn South Carolina he labored tirelessly to build the AME, founding \nmany new churches in the countryside, while at the same time growing \nthe Charleston church. Under his leadership it numbered two thousand \nmembers. Meanwhile he also became politically active, helping to \nfound the South Carolinas Republican party. He would serve on the \nstates Constitutional Convention, in its senate, and as a United \nStates congressman. He founded and edited a Republican newspaper \nwhich did not hesitate to blast Republican corruption. He was ever an \nadvocate of equal male suffrage and civil rights and was prominent in \nhis advocacy of land reform in conjunction with the South Carolina \nLand Commission. His most famous saying was from a speech in \nCongress: All that we ask is equal laws, equal legislation, and \nequal rights\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1880, Cain was elected a bishop of the AME, the fourteenth man to \nhave served in that capacity.

    "title": "FEMALE APOSTLES AND DEACONESSESS",
    "words": "\u0014\nPauls final greetings to the Roman Church seem typical. We might \njust skim over the list of names without a second thought. But one \nname within that list has become the focus of controversy and heated \ndebate:\u0014\n\u0014\nGreet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They \nare well known among the apostles, and they were in Christ before me. \n(Rom 16:7)\u0014\n\u0014\nJunia is most likely the name of a woman. When you read the phrase \namong the apostles, you understand how a simple salutation has \nbecome a prooftext in the debate over the role of women in ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe evidence that Junia is a woman is compelling. Its Greek spelling \n(Iounian) could point to either a man or a woman. However, the \naddition of an accent mark would specify genderdepending on what \nmark was chosen (Greek has several) and on which syllable the accent \nmark was placed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest manuscripts of the New Testament were written in an \nuppercase Greek script (uncial) that did not include accents. But \ncopies of the Greek New Testament from later periods in a cursive \nscript (minuscule) accent the name as female.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn ancient Greek literature, outside the New Testament, the masculine \nform of the name has only surfaced once. Ancient Latin texts have \nalso been searched, with some theorizing that Junia might be a \nshortened form of the male Junianus. Of the 250 or more citations of \nthe name Junia, where a shortening of the name is possible, all have \nreferred to women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe phrase among the apostles can also be translated as to the \napostles, placing Junia within or outside this ministry category. \nEither translation is possible within the scope of Greek grammar. \nExternal examples, though, statistically favor the first option.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there are other issues that are rarely raised in this \ndebate. New Testament apostles, for instance, are not all described \non equal terms. The original 12 disciples, along with Paul, were a \nspecial group. They were first-hand pupils of Christ, some of whom \nGod endowed with supernatural spiritual gifts (Acts 5:12) and divine \nrevelation in the form of the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all apostles had such gifts, however. Aside from the 12 disciples \nand Paul, it is not clear that the term apostle spoke of high \nauthority or even expectations of the role. The Greek word apostolos \nsimply means messenger or sent onesomeone sent out for a \nspecific task, akin to our concept of a missionary. Although the \napostle Barnabas did preach and teach (Acts 15:35), Epaphroditus is \nnot described in such terms. Apostles were also sent out to \nrepresent churches, but we are not told in what capacity (2 Cor \n8:23). \u0014\n\u0014\nPaul did not appoint apostles for local church leadership. As a \nresult, the precise relationship of apostle to modern church \nleadership ministry is evasive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough there are all these uncertainties, the issue of Junia as a \nfemale apostle teaches us that paying attention to the details in the \nBible matters. Things can get complicated, but theyre certainly \ninteresting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we also learn from this example that women played a strategic \nrole in the early Church.\u0014",

    "words": "Thomas Brisco\u0014\n\u0014\n      Historically the Israelite tribes of Naphtali, Zebulun, \nIssachar, and Asher settled Galilee. However, Galilee came under \nGentile control during the Assyrian invasion in 733 B.C. and remained \noutside of Jewish control for six centuries down to the eras of the \nMaccabean Revolt and Hasmonean Dynasty (16763 B.C.). The Maccabean \nbrothers Jonathan (160142 B.C.) and Simeon (142135 B.C.) assisted \nJews in Galilee and campaigned against Seleucid troops in the region \n(1 Macc. 5:1423; 11:63; 12:4649). The Hasmonean rulers John \nHyrcanus (135104 B.C.) and Aristobulus (104103 B.C.) solidified \nJewish control over Galilee, the latter forcing circumcision upon \nItureans who lived in the area. Galilee was fully integrated into the \nJewish state ruled by Alexander Jannaeus (10376 B.C.). By the late \nsecond century B.C. Galilee came under Jewish control. But who were \nthe Galileans? Some scholars think they were descendants of the old \nGalilean Israelite tribes who remained culturally intact through the \ncenturies. Others believe Galileans were converted Itureans. Yet \nothers say Galilee was rejudaized during the Maccabean and \nHasmonean periods by the establishment of Jewish fortresses in \nGalilee and Jewish immigration. The last alternative seems most \nplausible, but undoubtedly all three suggestions contain elements of \ntruth. In any case, Galilee was essentially Jewish and under Jewish \ncontrol by the late second century B.C.\u0014\n\u0014\n      The Romans acknowledged the Jewish character of Galilee by \ntheir administrative policies. The Roman general Pompey, who \nconquered Palestine in 63 B.C., placed all of western Palestine \nincluding Galilee under the authority of the Jewish high priest and \nethnarch (ruler of a people) Hyrcanus II. Politically Hyrcanus \ndepended on the Idumean strongman Antipater, a man trusted by the \nRomans, who appointed his son Herod governor of Galilee. In 40 B.C. \nthe Romans selected Herod as a client-king and gave him \nresponsibility for all Palestine. Herod the Great ruled the Jews \nuntil his death in 4 B.C.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Augustus divided Herods kingdom among three of Herods \nsurviving sons. Herod Antipas received Galilee and Perea along with \nthe title tetrarchruler of a fourth. Herod Antipas ruled Galilee \nfrom 4 B.C. until he was deposed by the Romans in A.D. 39, a time \nspan that included Jesus and John the Baptists ministries.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosephuss well-known description of Galilee praises the agricultural \nfertility of the land. Land was the measure of social and economic \nstatus. Many Galileans were peasant farmers who owned or leased a \nsmall plot of land. Typical farms included a vineyard, an olive \ngrove, and a small piece of land for growing wheat and vegetables. \nGalilee was renown for its olive oil and produced enough oil, wine, \nand wheat to export. Larger estates existed in the region similar to \nthe Herodian royal estates in the Jezreel Valley. A few may have been \nowned by wealthy absentee landlords. The parables of Jesus mention \nsuch landlords (Matt. 21:3341) and the stewards of larger estates \n(Luke 16:18) as well as tenants who leased the land (Luke 20:9). The \nsmall-scale farmer also appeared in Jesus parables, a situation \nperhaps more typical of Galilee in the first century (Matt. 21:2832).\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas V.

    "words": "Famed Southern Baptist, George W. Truett\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge W. Truett was born on this day, May 6, 1867 on a farm in the \nmountains of North Carolina. He became one of the most popular boys \nin the county, equally handy on the farm, at his desk or sighting \ndown a rifle barrel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral times as a child and then as a young man, George recognized \nhis need for a savior from his sins. But he was nineteen before he \nwent forward, \"confessing Christ before all the people.\" That very \nnight he began to urge his classmates to turn to Christ. Many did. He \nwas baptized, joined the Baptist church and began to teach Sunday \nschool. Not only that, but, to pay his way through college, the young \nman opened a school, which soon enrolled 300 students and employed \nthree teachers! He preached. Those who heard him speak called him a \nsecond Spurgeon. He was offered a church, but turned it down. He had \ndecided to move with his parents to Texas. And Texas is where he made \nhis mark for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe local Baptist church at Whitewright Texas decided to ordain him. \nGeorge protested, but \"there I was against a whole church...\" He was \nordained, but as of yet held no church. Instead, the 23-year-old \naccepted the position as chief financial officer of Baylor University \nbecause, \"people do what he asks them to do.\" The school was deeply \nin debt by the standards of the day. In 23 months, George eliminated \nthe debt completely. Later he was offered the school's presidency, \nbut he turned it down, preferring to pastor a church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 30, George became pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, \nTexas. He had wanted to turn it down, but felt God was saying, \"take \nit.\" During his 47 years of leadership, the church grew from 715 \nmembers to over 7,000. Even after it was remodeled, a thousand people \nmight be turned away from the doors on a given Sunday. It was the \nlargest membership in the Southern Baptist denomination, the largest \nmembership in the world (at that time) and highly influential. Other \nthan his excellent speaking, another source of growth was his \ntraining program for Sunday school teachers.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople hung on George's words. In one sermon, he said \"Our cities \nsaved means the salvation of civilization. Our cities lost means the \ncorruption and destruction of civilization.\" He then went on to show \nthat the family is the key to the city. \"As goes the home, so will go \nthe city. And I pause to say that the home is in peril and endangered \nnow as it has not been in modern times. ...If people trifle with the \nhome they are undermining the foundation of an enduring and worthy \ncivilization...Put crepe on the door of your heart if things are \nwrong in the family. Put crepe on the door.\" He always preached for a \ndecision.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge almost left the pulpit once, however. He accidentally shot and \nkilled one of his closest friends, the chief of police, in a hunting \naccident. Praying and crying, he could not bring himself to preach \nagain, until in a vision he saw Christ saying \"You are my man from \nnow on.\" The night that he returned to the pulpit, other churches \nclosed their doors so that their members could go hear him preach.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn his seventieth birthday he wrote his wife a letter in which he \nsaid, \"I would this day rededicate my all to Christ...\" Although \ngreatly honored in his life, none of it went to his head. He died in \n1944 after a painful illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nResources\u0014\n\u0014\nEzell, John S. \"Truett, George Washington.\" Dictionary of American \nBiography.\u0014\nPerez, Joan Jenkins. \"Truett, George Washington.\" \nhttp://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/ \narticles/view/TT/ftr16.html.\u0014\nReese, Ed.

    "title": "FLORENCE YOUNG -- FROM FARM GIRL TO FEARLESS MISSION PIONEER",
    "words": "FLORENCE YOUNG: FROM FRIGHTENED FARM-GIRL TO FEARLESS MISSION PIONEER\u0014\n \u0014\nDURING THE EARLY YEARS of her life, Florence Selina Young, the \ndaughter of Plymouth Brethren parents in New Zealand, lived in terror \nof Christs Second Coming. But when she was eighteen at a prayer \nmeeting she was suddenly able to apply the promise of Isaiah 43:25 \nfor herself (I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions \nfor mine own sake) and felt a surge of love for Christ. She felt free \nto partake of the Lords Table and to be baptized. \u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately she began working for the Lord. In her first ventures \nteaching the Solomon Islanders who worked on plantations in \nQueensland, Australia she taught the gospel in pidgin English using \npictures and a large-print New Testament. To explain the \nResurrection, she used a chrysalis. Her efforts resulted in the \nformation of the Queensland Kanaka Mission. After several years \nworking with Solomon islanders in Queensland, she turned the work \nover to others and joined Hudson Taylors China Inland Mission. She \nhad become conversant with Chinese when events (including a nervous \nbreakdown) forced her to return to Australia. However, her mission \ntraining would serve her well.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in 1900, the Christians in her circle were drawn by a \ndesire to pray for the Holy Spirit. They felt the need to extend the \nQueensland work to the Solomon Islands and gradually brought it \nabout. Young would eventually administer the South Sea Evangelical \nMission and tour the islands repeatedly between 1904 and 1926. In \n1904 Young made her first trip to Malaita, largest of the Solomons. \nBut the start of the mission work was plagued with difficulties, \nincluding attacks of malaria that prostrated all the missionaries. \nYoung was forced to return to Australia. However, other workers were \nable to obtain land and build a mission house. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, revival broke out in 1905 among the Solomon Islanders \nworking in Queensland. The men prayed long hours, and sought the \nfilling of the Spirit of God. That same year, despite warnings of \ndanger, Young visited Malaita again to encourage indigenous workers. \nThe serious difficulties and dangers faced by sailboats caused the \nmissionaries to pray for a motorized boat. When Young addressed a \n1906 meeting in Sydney, Australia, she sensed that some surprise was \nin the works. It was: the assemblage presented her with 417 they had \nsecretly raised toward purchasing just such a boat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1907 the Queensland work ended because Australias recruitment \nlaws had changed, requiring the planters to send the Solomon \nIslanders home. Young and other missionaries toured the islands in \ntheir motor-powered boat, taught in villages, called the fallen back \nto Christ, provided medical care, and operated training centers. The \nwork was arduous and fraught with danger. Because of long-established \nblood feuds, many Christian workers met violent deaths. Others died \nof common hazards: storms, drownings, malaria, and untreated medical \nconditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the islanders themselves learned to preach simple but \neffective messages. One, preaching on 2 Corinthians 5:7 (If any man \nbe in Christ, he is a new creature) said in pidgin English: Suppose \nyou savee [know] about Jesus, [does] that save you? No. Plenty white \nman savee Jesus along [i.e.: in the] head. That no good. We must \nbelieve in Jesus along heart. He compared knowing Jesus to knowing a \ncertain missionary who was currently away in Australia but would soon \nbe back. So would Jesus be back. By-and-by He come, we look along \nface belong Him and then we plenty glad!\u0014\n\u0014\nA wonderful testimony to Gods power came in 1909 when an old and \nfilthy witchdoctora man so evil he had cooked and eaten his own \nwifecame to Christ. The womans son had fled when ordered to fetch \nwater to cook his mother. After signing up to work on a plantation he \nhad become a Christian, returned home, and brought his father to hear \nthe gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of Florence Youngs death, on this day 28 May 1940, in \nKillara, New South Wales, 7,900 islanders had come to Christ.\u0014",

    "words": "Fasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay \nColony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the \ntragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons \nfor the day of fasting given by the resolution were, \"so all of God's \npeople may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity \nmay be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this \nland; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we \nhave done amiss, to do so no more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of \njustice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's \nPuritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen \nwere hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused \nwere women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's \ntownspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the \nproceedings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were \nbewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had \nseen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, \nscapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no \nevidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was \npresented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two \nwitnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. \nIt was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the \naccused.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers \nrather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out \nstrongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the \nBiblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige \nof Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the \nwhole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts \nlegislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held \non January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could \noffer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them \nfrom repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the \nland. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the \ntrials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and \nguidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided \nover many of the capital judgments, published a written confession \nacknowledging his own \"blame and shame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSalem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the \ntrials.

    "words": "When Conrad Grebel arrived at St. Gall Switzerland, on this day March \n25, 1525, he began to speak on the need for repentance and baptism. \nHundreds turned out to hear him preach and over the next few months, \nhe baptized five hundred. What was significant about this was that \nmost of them had already been baptized as infants.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrebel was in exile from Zurich. Well-educated, he had studied the \nBible with Uhlrich Zwingli, the reformer of Zurich, and stood by him \nas he made changes in the city. However, Grebel thought that Zwingli \nmoved too slow in implementing reforms based on the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Conrad Grebel became convinced from Scripture that infant baptism \nwas wrong. In order to exercise faith, a person had to be old enough \nto understand the Gospel. Baptism could only have meaning for a \nperson who understood why he or she was being baptized. Those who \nthought this way were called Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli and Grebel held public debates on the issue, but Zwingli \nstuck with infant baptism and so did Zurich. Consequently, Conrad \nGrebel and a number of others decided to obey their consciences. \nGrebel is often called the \"Father of the Anabaptists\" because on \nJanuary 21, 1525, he re-baptized George Blaurock, a former priest. It \nwas the first such adult baptism in Zurich.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately the Zurich authorities forbade the Anabaptists to speak \nabout their beliefs on adult baptism. Shortly afterward, they drove \nthe Anabaptists out. Soon they would be killing them, often by \ndrowning. Grebel went to St. Gall, where he found immediate success.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventh months later, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life in \nprison. Friends helped him escape, but his life was destined to be \nshort all the same. He could not outrun the plague, which carried him \noff less than two years after he baptized George Blaurock. He was \nonly about 29 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Conrad Grebel left few writings, he left many converts. A \ncollege in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is named for Conrad Grebel. It \nwas founded by Mennonites--spiritual offspring of the early \nAnabaptist reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBautz, Friedrich William. \"Grebel, Konrad.\" \n(http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/g/grebel_k.shtml).\u0014\nBender, Harold S.

He bought a paper and opened it in the cafe where he went for \nbreakfast. The headlines announced that the King of Sweden had just \ndied. The account told how the queen had sat at the bedside of her \nhusband, comforting him from the Scriptures and reading the precious \npromises of divine forgiveness through Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe same sacrifice on Calvary that brought peace to a king had \nprocured pardon to a prisoner.\u0014",

    "words": "Five Errors to Drop From Your Easter Sermon\u0014\nIf you want to help people see Holy Week with fresh eyes, start by \ndropping these familiar fallacies.\u0014\nANDREAS J. KSTENBERGER AND JUSTIN TAYLOR\u0014\n|\u0014\nAPRIL 15, 2014   CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Don't say Jesus died when he was 33 years old\u0014\n.\u0014\nThe common assertion seems reasonable that if Jesus \"began his \nministry\" when he \"was about thirty years of age\" (Luke 3:23) and \nengaged in a three-year ministry (John mentions three Passovers, and \nthere might have been a fourth one), then he was 33 years old at the \ntime of his death. However, virtually no scholar believes Jesus was \nactually 33 when he died. Jesus was born before Herod the Great \nissued the decree to execute \"all the male children in Bethlehem and \nin all that region who were two years old or under\" (Matt. 2:16, ESV) \nand before Herod died in the spring of 4 B.C. If Jesus was born in \nthe fall of 5 or 6 B.C., and if we remember that we don't count the \n\"0\" between B.C. and A.D., then Jesus would have been 37 or 38 years \nold when he died in the spring of A.D. 33 (as we believe is most \nlikely). Even if Jesus died in the year A.D. 30 (the only serious \nalternative date), he would have been 34 or 35, not 33 years old. No \nmajor doctrine is affected by this common misconception. But don't \ndamage your credibility by confidently proclaiming \"facts\" from the \npulpit that are not true.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Don't explain the apparent absence of a lamb at the Last Supper by \nonly saying Jesus is the ultimate Passover Lamb.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it is gloriously true that Jesus is \"the Lamb of God, who takes \naway the sin of the world\" (John 1:29), this does not mean there was \nno physical paschal lamb at the Lord's Supper. In fact, there almost \ncertainly was: \"Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the \nPassover lamb [pascha] had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and \nJohn, saying, 'Go and prepare the Passover [pascha] for us, that we \nmay eat it [i.e., the pascha]'\" (Luke 22:78; cf. Mark 14:12). Even \nif it isn't specifically mentioned in the Gospel accounts, eating the \npaschal lamb was an important part of every Jewish Passover (Ex. \n12:3). This is why the disciples ate the meal together as a group, at \nnight, within the city gates, where it would have been eaten with red \nwine and consumed before the breaking of bread and singing of a hymn. \nWhile there's disagreement about the nature of the Last Supper, we \nthink it's clear that Jesus celebrated Passover with the Twelve on \nthe night before the crucifixionwith Jesus making it clear that he \nsaw himself in the tradition of God's mighty deliverance of his \npeople Israel from bondage in Egypt by the blood of a sacrificial \nlamb.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Don't say the same crowds worshiped Jesus on Palm Sunday and then \ncried out for his crucifixion on Good Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of statement makes for a powerful sermon point to \nillustrate the fickleness of the human heart when it comes to Jesus \nthe Messiah. But a couple of qualifications need to be added. First, \nit is not entirely clear that the \"Hosanna!\" crowd acclaiming Jesus' \ntriumphal entry is the same group of people as the \"Crucify him!\" \ncrowd gathered before Pontius Pilate. The former seem to be mainly \npilgrims from Galilee along with Jesus's disciples, while the latter \nseem to be largely those from Jerusalem. Second, both crowds are \nexpressing passion based on misunderstanding. As Jesus rode into \nJerusalem on a donkey, the excitement of those proclaiming \"Hosanna!\" \nwas based on an erroneous nationalistic conception of the Messiah. \nAnd when Jesus stood with Pontius Pilate before the Jerusalem Jews, \nstirred up by their leaders who were falsely charging Jesus with \nblasphemy, their condemnation was likewise based on a misconception \nof the Messiah's identity. The common bond between both crowds is not \nthe fickleness of the human heart but the lack of genuine knowledge \nand worship of the humble Messiah and suffering Servant.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Don't bypass the role of the women as witnesses of the resurrected \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number and identity of the women in the resurrection accounts can \nbe difficult to untangle, which is one of the reasons why we provide \na glossary in The Final Days of Jesus as a guide. One of the \nconfusing things, for example, is that no less than four of the women \nshare the name Mary: (1) Mary Magdalene; (2) Mary the mother of \nJesus; (3) Mary the mother of James and Joses/Joseph; and (4) Mary \nthe wife of Clopas (who may have been the brother of Joseph of \nNazareth). In addition, there is Joanna (whose husband, Chuza, was \nthe household manager for Herod Antipas) and Salome (probably the \nmother of the apostles James and John).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs you preach this Easter, do not bypass the testimony of the women \nas an incidental detail. In the first century, women were not even \neligible to testify in a Jewish court of law. Josephus said that even \nthe witness of multiple women was not acceptable \"because of the \nlevity and boldness of their sex.\" Celsus, the second-century critic \nof Christianity, mocked the idea of Mary Magdalene as an alleged \nresurrection witness, referring to her as a \"hysterical female  \ndeluded by  sorcery.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis background matters because it points to two crucial truths. \nFirst, it is a theological reminder that the kingdom of the Messiah \nturns the system of the world on its head. In this culture, Jesus \nradically affirmed the full dignity of women and the vital value of \ntheir witness. Second, it is a powerful apologetic reminder of the \nhistorical accuracy of the resurrection accounts. If these were \n\"cleverly devised myths\" (2 Pet. 1:16, ESV), women would never have \nbeen presented as the first eyewitnesses of the risen Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Don't focus on the suffering of Jesus to the extent that you \nneglect the glory of the Cross in and through the Resurrection.\u0014\nCertain Christian traditions tend to focus almost unilaterally on the \nsuffering of Jesus on the cross, on the incredible pain he had to \nendure, and on his humiliation and separation from God. This can be \nseen in cinematic depictions such as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the \nChrist, the Roman Catholic reenactment of his path to the crucifixion \non the Via Dolorosa (the Way of Sorrows) in the stations to the \nCross, and in quite a few sermons both of us have heard in the \nevangelical churches we attended (not to mention many of our favorite \nhymns). Of course, the four biblical Gospels, especially Matthew, \nMark, and Luke, concur that Jesus suffered a great deal for us as he \ngave his life for our salvation so that we could be forgiven of our \nsins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, there is another aspect to the Easter story. It is best \nencapsulated in John's statement that Jesus, when he \"knew that his \nhour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved \nhis own who were in the world  loved them to the end\" (13:1, ESV). \nWhen introducing not only the scene of the foot-washing, but his \nentire passion narrative, John writes the following: \"Jesus, knowing \nthat the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had \ncome from God and was going back to God, rose from supper\" (13:34; \ncf. 14:28).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, John is at pains to show that the Cross was not a \ndead end but a station on Jesus' way back home to the Father! This is \nwhy he strikes a triumphant note at the outset of narrating the \nCrucifixion: The Father had given all things into Jesus' hands, and \nJesus was on his way back to his pre-existent glory which he enjoyed \nwith the Father (17:5, 24)! It is, as the writer of Hebrews put it, \n\"for the joy that was set before him\" that Jesus \"endured the cross, \ndespising the shame\" (12:2). This Easter, let's make sure we don't \nleave out the \"glory\" part when we tell the story of Jesus' \nsuffering. No doubt, the Cross was glorious in and of itself in \ndisplaying Jesus' perfect obedience, God's love for humanity, and the \nGod-man's rendering of substitutionary atonement for sinners. Jesus' \nearthly work is indeed \"finished\" (John 19:30), but his glorious work \nof ruling, reigning, and interceding continues to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAndreas Kstenberger is senior research professor of New Testament \nand Biblical Theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in \nWake Forest, North Carolina.

When \nshe was a young girl, her father placed her in a German convent \nfollowing his remarriage. She heard Luthers teachings in her early \ntwenties and accepted his doctrine of justification by faith alone. \nWith some other nuns she contacted the reformer, requesting help to \nescape the convent. Luther arranged for a delivery-man to smuggle the \nwomen out in empty fish barrels. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuther asked the families of the young women to take them back. When \nthey proved unwilling, he found husbands for all of them. However, he \nwas not able to find a place for Katie. Eventually he proposed to her \nand married her the same day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey seem to have been a happy couple. Her hard work and practical \ndomestic skills (budgeting, raising livestock, and brewing beer) fed \nand clothed them, their children, several orphans, and the many \nstudents who boarded with them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Luthers death, Katie reared their younger children alone for \nsix years. Elector John Frederick, the ruler of Saxony, set up a \nsmall trust fund and helped her purchase a farm near Wittenberg. \nHowever, her land was taxed unmercifully by contending armies during \nthe Schmalkaldic War, leaving her in crushing poverty. As a result, \nshe had to flee. Her animals were confiscated and her house burned to \nthe ground. After peace was restored, Katie borrowed a thousand \ngulden to rebuild. To repay her loan, she took student boarders. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen plague broke out in Wittenberg in 1552, the university staff and \nstudents moved to Torgau, a place less affected by the disease. With \nher boarders gone, Katherina was again in dire financial straits. She \ndecided to follow the university, but her decision proved \ncatastrophic. At the end of the sixty mile trip, not far from the \ngate of Torgau, her horses bolted and she had to leap from the wagon \ninto a lake. She was lifted from the water severely bruised. Friends \ncarried her into the city. Although she fought for life for three \nmonths, the pain and hardships of her latter years sealed her \ninevitable end. Her last recorded words were, I will cling to my \nLord Christ as a burr on a coat. On this day, 20 December 1552 she \ndied. Next day, the entire university turned out for her funeral.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "APR 28, 2010\u0014\nFasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials \u0014\n \u0014\nOn this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay \nColony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the \ntragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons \nfor the day of fasting given by the resolution were, \"so all of God's \npeople may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity \nmay be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this \nland; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we \nhave done amiss, to do so no more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of \njustice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's \nPuritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen \nwere hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused \nwere women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's \ntownspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the \nproceedings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were \nbewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had \nseen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, \nscapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no \nevidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was \npresented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two \nwitnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. \nIt was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the \naccused.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers \nrather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out \nstrongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the \nBiblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige \nof Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the \nwhole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts \nlegislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held \non January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could \noffer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them \nfrom repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the \nland. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the \ntrials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and \nguidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided \nover many of the capital judgments, published a written confession \nacknowledging his own \"blame and shame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSalem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the \ntrials. In 1710, the Massachusetts legislature reversed some of the \nconvictions, and in the following years authorities gave compensation \nto the families of the accused witches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nKennedy, James with Newcombe, Jerry.

He, along with his \nwife, Jane and their five \u0014\nchildren, quickly won the hearts of FBC members. \u0014\n\u0014\nSid and Kathryn Camp fondly reminisce of Brother Fred's encouragement \nin 1965 to become \u0014\nFalls Creek sponsors, greatly enlarged in his ministry, a position \nthey served in for more than 20 years. To date, the Camps continue to \nbe active in the care of our Falls Creek facility. \u0014\n\u0014\nMemories of gratitude are shared by Morris and Cindy Cochran, Jim and \nSharon Cathey and \u0014\nMax and Judy Lane and many others for their lives and marriages have \nbeen enriched from the wisdom and guidance of his counseling. From \nthese unions have come eight children, all members of FBC. Praise \nGod! \u0014\n\u0014\nJane Skaggs is described as a beautiful person both inside and out. \nHer years in Atoka were \u0014\nsurely busy ones as a pastor's wife and mother while rearing five \nsmall children. She is remembered \u0014\nas an inspiration as she maintained her composure getting their five \nchildren to church -- even if \u0014\nher earrings were not a matching set! Her tactful, sweet spirit was a \nblessing to all. It should also \u0014\nbe mentioned that her patience with Fred's love for horses and the \nstories that went with them have \u0014\nsurely added jewels to her crown. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor 26 years the outstanding memory of those who were privileged to \nstudy under Brother Fred's \u0014\nteaching have described him as a scholar, most intelligent and a \nwonderful, wonderful teacher of \u0014\nGod's Word. \u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Olliebelle Thacker recorded in her Bible Bro. Fred's last \nservice at FBC which was October \u0014\n2, 1966. The sermon subject for the morning service was \"Finally My \nBrethren,\" taken from \u0014\nEphesians 6:6-10. The evening sermon subject, \"The Word In The Upper \nRoom,\" followed by the \u0014\nLord's Supper was, in Mrs. Thacker's memory, a beautiful service. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lasting effect of Fred Skagg's leadership upon First Baptist \nChurch is evidence he was truly \u0014\na man directed by God. Many sweet and beautiful memories were left by \nthe Skaggs family for the \u0014\nhistory of our church for which we are so thankful. \u0014\n\u0014\nMRS. JEWEL CALHOUN\u0014",

The campaign's tag line \nis, \"They're your kids.

Boys without a father in their life are 63 \npercent more likely to run away and 37 percent more likely to abuse \ndrugs.

    "words": "Fundamental vs. Fundamentalist\u0014\n\u0014\nJess Smith\u0014\n03-27-01 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this new century, we must distinguish between being fundamental \nand fundamentalist.\u0014\n\"I am fundamental but I am not a fundamentalist,\" said James P. \nBoyce, the first president and founder of the Southern Baptist \nTheological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fundamental is to believe in and declare the fundamentals of \nthe faith as stated clearly in the Apostles Creed. These \nfundamentals are embraced by evangelicals and define the content of \nour faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut todays fundamentalism goes beyond these truths, making it more \nand more difficult to be fundamental without taking on the garments \nof fundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, today the battle is not about the infallibility of the \nBible. It is about the fundamentalist interpretation and \nappropriation of that Bible for a social and political agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Piper has summarized the fallacies of fundamentalism:\u0014\n1. the absence of a historical perspective\u0014\n2. the lack of appreciation for scholarship\u0014\n3. the substitution of brief skeletal creeds or confessions for \nhistoric confessions\u0014\n4. the lack of concern for precise formulation of Christian doctrine\u0014\n5. the pietistic, perfectionist tendencies (legalism)\u0014\n6. one-sided other-worldliness (i.e., a lack of effort to transform \nculture)\u0014\n7. a penchant for futuristic chiliasm (pre-millenialism). \u0014\nAdd to this list control, a sense of superiority and arrogance, and \none has defined fundamentalism in our day.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism has departed from the fundamentals. It indoctrinates \nrather than educates. It suppresses the pursuit of truth and \nsubstitutes a legalistic formula. It walks in conformity to a dogma \nthat stifles healthy discussion and removes the grandeur of our \nBaptist heritage. It uses the Bible for ideological coercion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism does not let the Bible speak as the living Word of \nGod. As Jesus said to the Sadducees, \"You are mistaken, not \nunderstanding the Scriptures or the power of God\" (Mt 22:29). \u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism is not satisfied until it dominates every sphere of \nlife. It can brook no rival nor tolerate any question that would \nthreaten its position.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people in this fundamentalist crusade do not see themselves as \ndisruptive or legalistic. They truly believe they are the \"saviors\" \nof Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay this much be clear: Baptists do not need saviors. We already have \none. And it is by him that we must interpret and proclaim the Word of \nGod. He is the criterion, standard and measure by which we must judge \nall things, live to the glory of God and embrace one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, can you be fundamental without being a fundamentalist? \nAbsolutely. Can you be radically in love with Christ without being \nlegalistic? Absolutely. Can we walk together in unity without being \nuniform? Absolutely.\u0014\n\u0014\nJess Smith is pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church, Huntsville, Ala.\u0014",

    "words": "Stephen Langton, who was archbishop of Canterbury in the thirteenth \ncentury, was the first to create chapter divisions for the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Synod of Toulouse in 1229 forbade everyone except priests from \npossessing a copy of the Scriptures. At that gathering, Pope Gregory \nIX asked Dominican friars to question suspects and prosecute \nheretics, making the friars a powerful force and keeping the Bible \nout of the hands of laypeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe invention of movable type by Johann Gutenberg was recently hailed \nas the most important technical advancement of the last millennium. \nGutenberg, a printer in Mainz, found a way to make many copies of a \npage by using letters made of lead. In 1456, he and his fellow \nprinters created two hundred copies of Jerome's Vulgate Bible. Prior \nto that time, all books were hand printed on papyrus sheets or animal \nskin, making them expensive, time-intensive, and rare. Consequently, \nfew people could read, and even fewer owned any books. Within twenty \nyears of Gutenberg's first printed Bible, the printers of Mainz had \ncreated more Bibles than had been produced by hand in the previous \nfourteen hundred years.\u0014",

    "words": "Feeling footloose and frisky, a featherbrained fellow forced his \nfather to fork over his farthings. Fast he flew to foreign fields and \nfrittered his family's fortune, feasting fabulously with floozies and \nfaithless friends. Flooded with flattery he financed a full-fledged \nfling of \"funny foam\" and fast food.\u0014\n\u0014\nFleeced by his fellows in folly, facing famine, and feeling faintly \nfuzzy, he found himself a feed-flinger in a filthy foreign farmyard. \nFeeling frail and fairly famished, he fain would have filled his \nframe with foraged food from the fodder fragments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fooey,\" he figured, \"my father's flunkies fare far fancier,\" the \nfrazzled fugitive fumed feverishly, facing the facts.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, frustrated from failure and filled with foreboding (but \nfollowing his feelings) he fled from the filthy foreign farmyard.\u0014\n\u0014\nFaraway, the father focused on the fretful familiar form in the field \nand flew to him and fondly flung his forearms around the fatigued \nfugitive. Falling at his father's feet, the fugitive floundered \nforlornly, \"Father, I have flunked and fruitlessly forfeited family \nfavor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the faithful Father, forbidding and forestalling further \nflinching, frantically flagged the flunkies to fetch forth the finest \nfatling and fix a feast.\u0014\n\u0014\nFaithfully, the father's first-born was in a fertile field fixing \nfences while father and fugitive were feeling festive. The foreman \nfelt fantastic as he flashed the fortunate news of a familiar family \nface that had forsaken fatal foolishness. Forty-four feet from the \nfarmhouse the first-born found a farmhand fixing a fatling.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrowning and finding fault, he found father and fumed, \"Floozies and \nfoam from frittered family funds and you fix a feast following the \nfugitive's folderol?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first-born's fury flashed, but fussing was futile. The frugal \nfirst-born felt it was fitting to feel \"favored\" for his faithfulness \nand fidelity to family, father, and farm. In foolhardy fashion, he \nfaulted the father for failing to furnish a fatling and feast for his \nfriends. His folly was not in feeling fit for feast and fatling for \nfriends; rather his flaw was in his feeling about the fairness of the \nfestival for the found fugitive.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis fundamental fallacy was a fixation on favoritism, not \nforgiveness. Any focus on feeling \"favored\" will fester and friction \nwill force the faded facade to fall. Frankly, the father felt the \nfrigid first-born's frugality of forgiveness was formidable and \nfrightful.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the father's former faithful fortitude and fearless forbearance \nto forgive both fugitive and first-born flourishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe farsighted father figured, \"Such fidelity is fine, but what \nforbids fervent festivity for the fugitive that is found? Unfurl the \nflags and finery, let fun and frolic freely flow. Former failure is \nforgotten, folly is forsaken. Forgiveness forms the foundation for \nfuture fortune.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFour facets of the father's fathomless fondness for faltering \nfugitives are:\u0014\n\u0014\n1) Forgiveness,\u0014\n2) Forever faithful friendship,\u0014\n3) Fadeless love, and\u0014\n4) A facility for forgetting flaws.\u0014",

    "words": "Fear, freedom and faithfulness\u0014\nBy John D. Pierce\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile moving through a bustling airport recently, I joked about \nactually overhearing two people nearby speaking in English. I was in \nOrlando or was it Atlanta, Dallas or Washington, D.C.?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt could have been just about anywhere in America. Recent reports \nshow that our eyes and ears do not deceive us. The changing Face of \nAmerican cultre is continuing at an unprecedented rate.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of where we live in this nation, those around its no \nlonger look, speak, act, think or worship just like us. And growing \nplttralism britws its share of challenges and even discomfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is something appealing about living in Mayberry where values \nare widely shared and no problem takes more than 30 minutes to \novercome. There, everyone shows up For worship at the community \nchurch and even Otis Campbell dries out by Sunday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reality of 21st century American life is quite different however.\u0014\nHindus, Muslims, Buddhists and nonreligious persons are no longer \nthose to whom we send missionaries. They are our neighbors, \nco-workers and classmates.\u0014\n\u0014\nFacing religious and cultural pluralism is not a choice for American \nChristians. But the way we face this pluralism is certainly of our \nchoosing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome see this unstoppable cultural shift as a threat to their comfort \nand their deeply held faith. They are afraid of losing that which is \nfamiliar and cherished.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey look for ways to fortify their preferred values and viewpoints \nwith cries of 'We were here first' and acts of legislative favoritism.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome couch the challenges of religious pluralism in terms of \nspiritual warfare  as if evil is the soul property of those outside \nour churches. Life is described as a confflict between 'us\" (good \northodox Christians) and \"them\" (anyone whodoes not agree with our \ntheological perspectives and political tactics.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, if we allow our fear of losing evangelical Christianity as a \ndominant religious expression in our community or nation to cause us \nto prop up our particular brand of fath with government support, then \nwe will be more responsible for the breakdown of religious freedom in \nthis country than those we fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must not sacrifice freedom out of fear. If we genuinely believe \nthe claims of Christ, then we must be willing to let the Holy Spirit \nwork along with our free and faithiful witness--not with the strong \narm of governmental force. Suppose the worst fear of some is realized \nand faith expression is no longer such a dominant religious force in \nthis nation. In that case, nothing would he more crucial to our \nspiritual exercise than a firmlv established commitment to religious \nliberty for all persons.\u0014\nFreedom of religion without governmental interference has served this \ncountry well since its formation and has allowed for the vibrant \nfaith of many Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can only demand for ourselves the rights of religious liberty' \nthat we are willing\u0014\nto extend to all others regardless of their religious choices. \nAnything less than freely chosen faith is not faith at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a better alternative than trying to shore up our religious \npreferences with governmental favoritism and railing against those \nwith differing perspectives and priorities. It is more courageous, \nconsiderate and Christ-like to see the challenges before us as \nopportunities for ministry rather than threats.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have long honored missionaries abroad for crossing difficult \nbarriers to convey the timeless, matchless and unhindered gospel \nmessage. It is now time for all of us to seize the new opportunities \nto cross the many cultural barriers arising in our own communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a bold and risky commitment has its requirements. We will need \nto live more consistent lives so the Christian message of our daily \nliving more clearly matches the life and teachings of' the one we \nclain to follow.We will have to sort through our familiar expressions \nof' faith and determine what is really biblical and what is cultural. \nWe will need to grant freedom to tltose with whom we disagree.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are at our Baptist best when we stand tall for the freedom of all \nAmerican to express their their religious convictions. In doing so, \nwe retain our cherished rights to express the love of Christ in the \nclearest. most attractive ways possible. (BT)\u0014",

Through anecdote and accolade, Reagan is \nremembered as the handsome actor who led a conservative revolution in \nwinning landslide elections for two terms as California governor and \ntWo more as president. In his later years, tbe former president \nbecame a sort of national grandfather before sinking into tl~e cruel \nfog of Alzheimer's disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn cable news networks, a never-ending videotape biography reviews \nReagan's advances from small-town lifeguard to movie star, from a \npresident who survived an assassination attempt tq a statesman \ndemanding, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,\" and finally to as \naged cowboy fading into the sunset.

Same believe that balance has been lost amid \nthe blessings.\u0014\n\"Stop the sugar-coating,\" columnist Joan Vennochi pleaded in The \nBoston Globe. \"Family loyalty is one thing. The media have a \ndifferent duty.... What's wrong with celebrating flawed humanity\u0014\n which describes us all  rather than promoting false sainthood?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Across the U.S. television dial and in major American newspapers, \nthe commentary is fawning almost in a Pravda- like way, far beyond \nthe normal reticence against speaking ill of the dead,\" cdmplained \nRobert Parry in Consortiumnews.com.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Left-of-center commentators compete with conservatives to hail \nReagan's\u0014\nsupposedly genial style and his alleged role in 'winning the Cold \nWar.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's understandable that there is a national salute to a former \npresident who was very popular,\" said Neas, a longtime liberal \nactivist who led the successful fight against Senate confirmation of \nJudge Robert Bork, a Reagan nominee to the Supreme Court.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeas said the record, however, should also reflect what Reagan \nactually did, including his \"dismal record\" on civil rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Lou Cannon, a Reagan biographer who wrote \"President Reagan: The \nRole of a Lifetime\" and covered bini for The Washington Post, said \nthe historical assessment will come soon enough.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To paraphrase Ecclesiastes, there's a time for everything,\" Cannon \nsaid in an e-mail forum with readers. \"I think the celebratory \ncontent of this week's commentaries reflects the human reality that \nRonald Reagan was a big part of our lives and that many Americans, \nincluding me, miss him.\"\u0014\n\"But I don't think this means an end to the debate about the wisdom \nof particular Reagan policies,\" he predicted. 'That debate is \ninevitably going to go on.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think the media are responding to the popular affection for \nReagan,\" said Cliff Kincaid, a spokesman for Accuracy in Media, a \nconservative interest group that usually charges liberal bias in \nreporting. \"Even some liberal journalists, including Dan Rather, who \nwas almost choking up on his newscast, have reassessed Reagan's two \nterms.\"\u0014\nIt was different in the 1980s, Kincaid said, when he wrote about \nanti-Reagan bias in the nationalmedia. \"Butlthinkthe media is \nsensitive these days about appearing too liberal and it would look \nbad to go after a president who had just died.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, with a widow tearfully leaning against a flag-draped coffin, \ntough political assessment comes hard.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for some critics, it has all become too much.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the coming months, the Republican propaganda machine will shift \ninto high gear. Their goal: to turn Ronald Reagan into a saint,\" \nwarned Ed Weathers in the Memphis Flyer, an alternative weekly in the \nTennessee city. \"Then George W.

    "title": "FACT, FICTION, AND FAITH",
    "words": "Fact, Fiction, and Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Evans\u0014\n06-11-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nFor months now Dan Browns novel The DaVinci Code has topped the \nbest-seller list. There are a couple of reasons. For one thing, its \na pretty good mystery action story. But that is not all thats going \non. Helping to fuel record sales is the books unique plot. The story \nis carried along on the back of a unique interpretation of Christian \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrawing upon reliable, as well as some not-so-reliable sources, Brown \nmakes the case that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. He also \nasserts that the church has suppressed this information for over \n2,000 years. The failure to at least consider the possibility that \nJesus was married and possibly had children is, according to Brown, \npart of a wider effort on the part of the church to eliminate from \nofficial church doctrine any significant role for the feminine \nexperience.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany in the Christian community are expressing concern about the \npopularity of the book. They fear that as people read the story they \nwill not be able to sort out the fact from the fiction and will be \nleft with a distorted view of the meaning of the Christian faith. In \nfact, these concerns have spawned a number of anti-Da Vinci code \nbooks which seek to directly refute some of Browns more \ncontroversial assertions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some justification for these concerns. Stories, especially \nwell-crafted stories, do have a certain subversive power. Jesus \ncertainly understood this. His skillful use of parables was effective \nin communicating important spiritual and theological lessons, but \nalso had the power to undermine the dominant religion of his day. \nThose who are committed to a male-dominated church have every reason \nto be concerned about a piece of fiction that celebrates the \npossibility of the divine feminine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhats ironic, however, is how quickly and exuberantly elements of \nthis same segment of Christianity have embraced another work of \nfiction as if it were Gospel truth. The Left Behind series written by \nTim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have sold nearly 50 million copies. \nThese books offer a fictional account of the end of time. Following \nwhat is known as the pre-millennial interpretation of the last days, \nLaHaye and Jenkins offer up graphic descriptions of the Rapture of \nthe church, the rise of the anti-Christ, and the triumphant \nappearance of Jesus at the Second Coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmazingly, even though the story line is a fictional adaptation of a \nparticular interpretation of a portion of the Bible, the Left Behind \nseries has taken on almost canonical significance. There are folks \nwho buy the books and give them away as evangelistic tools.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut suppose the pre-millennial view is wrong? It could be. Its just \nan interpretation; it is not infallible truth. What happens if \nChristians have misunderstood the message of the Book of Revelation? \nIt wouldnt be the first time that particularly difficult piece of \nNew Testament literature had been misread.\u0014\nBesides, there are other credible theories about the fulfillment of \nhistory. Jurgen Moltmanns Theology of Hope, just to name one \nalternative view, affirms Gods guiding role in the course of \nhistory, but rejects the pre-millennial idea of a predetermined \ndestruction of the universe. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Moltmann, God has a goal for creation that is \npurposeful, hopeful. Wouldnt it be sad if a fictional rendering of a \nskewed theology served to undermine a badly needed hope?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut theyre just stories, right? What do novelists know about the \nworkings of God in the world anyway?\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans is pastor of Auburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, \nAla.\u0014",

    "words": "In a sweeping, deeply researched survey of fundamentalism in its \nvarious international forms, Malise Ruthven explores the political, \nsocial, economic, and ideological background to this growing global \nphenomenon. Drawing on both religious materials and the latest \nscholarship, he details how religiosity has been transformed into a \nmandate for radical, often violent action. In the process, Ruthven \nreveals a surprisingly large number of family resemblances among \nthe worlds fundamentalists, including adherence to scriptural and \ntextual literalism, the rejection of pluralism, an apocalyptic \nembrace of violence, and the vicious repression of women. Despite \nunique, often opposing beliefs, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, \nand Hindu extremists invariably have a good deal in common. \u0014\n\u0014\nA revolt against modernity\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough quite obviously focused on the past (such as the wish to \npurify the Church or restore the lost caliphate), fundamentalism is a \ndecidedly modern affair. Extremists routinely employ methods and \ntechnologies invented by societies they despise. Christian \nfundamentalists, for example, denounce the greed and sinfulness of \npopular entertainment while broadcasting on their own media empires. \nOsama bin Ladens denunciation of Western culture and values rapidly \ncirculates via the Internet and satellite television. There is even a \nthriving trade in bin Laden tapes and videos throughout the Islamic \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nContrary to the predictions of social scientists and secular \nintellectuals, the religious impulse has not declined with the rise \nof modernity. In fact, almost the exact opposite has occurred. Since \nthe end of the Cold War, fundamentalism has emerged as the greatest \nthreat to world peace. This timely and provocative book will help you \nunderstand why.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Malise Ruthven has taught at the University of \nAberdeen, at the University of California, San Diego, and at \nDartmouth College.

    "title": "FROM PREACHER TO PRESIDENT",
    "words": "\u0014\nBy Bernard R. DeRemer\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 3,1850, James A. Garfield noted in his diary his \ndetermination to obey the gospel. The following day he recorded what \nis perhaps the clearest salvation testimony ever given by one who \nwould become president of the U.S.:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Today I was 'buried with Christ in baptism and arose to walk fin] \nnewness of life.' For as many as have been baptized into Christ have \nput on Christ.\" Later he expressed pleasure that God was blessing \nmeetings in the little local schoolhouse, where 17 had already \nprofessed faith in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn near Cleveland, Ohio, in 1831, Garfield grew up in poverty after \nhis father's death. But he attended Western Reserve Eclectic \nInstitute (now Hiram College), where he built fires, swept rooms, and \nrang the bell for a small stipend.\u0014\n\u0014\nGarfield taught in district schools, then became active in local \nDisciples of Christ groups; soon he was preaching himself. Though \nnever formally ordained (customary for his denomination in that day), \nhe ministered in various churches, preaching a salvation message from \nsuch passages as 2 Corinthians 5:17 and exhorting believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater he attended Williams (Mass.) College, where he distinguished \nhimself in debating and was graduated with honors in 1856. He married \nLucretia Rudolph, a former classmate.\u0014\n\u0014\nReturning to Hiram, he became principal, instilling new life into the \nschool. He read widely in literature and other fields; many Greek and \nLatin diary entries testify to his mastery of those subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier aversion to politics gradually gave way; Garfield began to \nfeel that a Christian's duty was to participate in public affairs as \nhe might have opportunity. He won a Republican seat in the Ohio \nSenate in 1859, studied law, and distinguished himself denouncing \nslavery and secession, while advocating force to preserve the Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he became a lieutenant colonel in the \n42nd Ohio Infantry; his military leadership was called superb. Later, \nhe resigned his commission as a major general to enter the U.S. House \nof Representatives, where he began serving as the youngest member of \nCongress and remained 17 years. He chaired the Appropriations \nCommittee and actively defended a conservative monetary policy. He \ncontinued attending church but was unable to preach so often as \nbefore because of the enormous demands of his office.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1880 Garfield was elected to the U.S. Senate, but never occupied \nthe seat. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, \nwhere, after a 35-ballot deadlock, he was nominated (as a \"dark \nhorse\") for president.\u0014\n\u0014\nGarfield's humble origin (he was the last president to be born in a \nlog cabin, the only one to have been a preacher), his political \nrecord, and a vigorous campaign brought him a narrow victory in the \ngeneral election. His brief, busy, and dramatic time in the White \nHouse laid the foundation for improved relations with Latin America \nbegan customs and postal reforms, and strengthened presidential power.\u0014\n\u0014\nGarfield was \"one of the few scholarly men\" to become president. He \nloved poetry and classics and \"used to entertain his friends by \nsimultaneously writing Latin with one hand and Greek with the other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly tragedy struck. On July 2, 1881, (less than four months \nafter inauguration), he was shot and seriously wounded by Charles J. \nGuiteau, a deranged lawyer and disappointed office seeker. He was to \nendure an agonizing series of relapses and rallies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nation's hearts were heavy with helpless agony during the \nthree-month ordeal. His fortitude won the admiration of all who saw \nhim. He constantly ran some degree of fever and was never entirely \nfree of discomfort. (In that simple pre-nuclear era, no major crisis \nforced resolution of the thorny question of presidential disability \nand succession.)\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Sunday morning Garfield heard church bells and was told that \npeople were praying for him. \"God bless them\" he murmured.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first, he seemed to improve following a move to New Jersey and sea \nair, but after pneumonia developed he sank rapidly. The end came on \nSept. 19. His 210-pound frame had wasted away to 135 pounds. His \nwounds probably would not have been fatal today, but then \"surgeons \nstill extracted bullets with unsterilized instruments.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe valiant soldier for Christ and country had fought his last fight, \nfinished his course, and kept the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Sunday Digest, --David C. Cook Pub. Co.\u0014",

The new study, the authors say, is the first to \nexplore whether the act of eating together actually causes those \nbenefits or if family meals simply act as a proxy measure for \nfamily connectedness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe researchers found benefits above and beyond a general sense of \nconnectedness to family members, according to the study.\u0014\n\u0014\nPossible explanations include that eating together reflects a greater \nproportion of supervised time, and thereby less opportunity to engage \nin behaviors that occur when a parent is not present. The family meal \nmight also provide an informal check-in time for parents to assess \nthe emotional health of their children. Family mealtimes may also \nmean that children spend less time away from home, where they can be \ninfluenced by negative peer pressure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe authors recognize that many families have no choice to be \ntogether at home at mealtimes, such as those with late-night work \nschedules.

    "words": "Forgive and Let Live\u0014\nRevenge is sweet, but letting go of anger at those who wronged you is \na smart route to good health\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Jordana Lewis and Jerry Adler\u0014\nNewsweek\u0014\n\u0014\nSept. 27, 2004 issue - Of all the extraordinary events in the life of \nJohn Paul II, few can compare with the 21 minutes he spent in a \nwhite-walled cell in Rome's Rebibia prison. Just after Christmas, \n1983, the pope visited Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who 30 months earlier \nhad shot him in St. Peter's Square. He presented Agca with a silver \nrosary, and something else as well: his forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt requires a Christ-like forbearance to pardon a would-be assassin, \nof course. But how many of us are ready to forgive an unfaithful \nlover, a scheming colleague or even the jerk who cut into the line at \nKrispy Kreme? Persistent unforgiveness is part of human nature, but \nit appears to work to the detriment not just of our spiritual \nwell-being but our physical health as well. The subject is one of the \nhottest fields of research in clinical psychology today, with more \nthan 1,200 published studies, up from just 58 as recently as 1997. It \neven has its own foundationA Campaign for Forgiveness Researchwhich \nsponsored a conference last year with papers on topics like \n\"Exploring Gender Differences in Forgiveness.\" (The largest number of \npapers dealt with forgiveness in marital and romantic relationships, \nwhich seem to generate an inordinate amount of interpersonal \nresentment.) Dr. Dean Ornish, America's all-purpose lifestyle guru, \nregards forgiveness as the tofu of the soul, a healthful alternative \nto the red meat of anger and vengeance. \"In a way,\" Ornish says, \"the \nmost selfish thing you can do for yourself is to forgive other \npeople.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nResearch suggests that forgiveness works in at least two ways. One is \nby reducing the stress of the state of unforgiveness, a potent \nmixture of bitterness, anger, hostility, hatred, resentment and fear \n(of being hurt or humiliated again). These have specific physiologic \nconsequencessuch as increased blood pressure and hormonal \nchangeslinked to cardiovascular disease, immune suppression and, \npossibly, impaired neurological function and memory. One study \nexamined 20 individuals in happy relationships, matched with 20 in \ntroubled relationships. The latter had higher baseline levels of \ncortisol, a hormone associated with impaired immune functionwhich \nshot up even further when they were asked to think about their \nrelationships. \"It happens down the line, but every time you feel \nunforgiveness, you are more likely to develop a health problem,\" says \nEverett Worthington, executive director of A Campaign for Forgiveness \nResearch.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other benefit of forgiveness is more subtle; it relates to \nresearch showing that people with strong social networksof friends, \nneighbors and familytend to be healthier than loners. Someone who \nnurses grudges and keeps track of every slight is obviously going to \nshed some relationships over the course of a lifetime. Forgiveness, \nsays Charlotte vanOyen Witvliet, a researcher at Hope College in \nHolland, Mich., should be incorporated into one's personality, a way \nof life, not merely a response to specific insults.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, forgiveness turns out to be a surprisingly complex process, \naccording to many researchers. Worthington distinguishes what he \ncalls \"decisional forgiveness\"a commitment to reconcile with the \nperpetratorfrom the more significant \"emotional forgiveness,\" an \ninternal state of acceptance. Forgiveness does not require us to \nforgo justice, or to make up to people we have every right to \ndespise. Anger has its place in the panoply of human emotions, but it \nshouldn't become a way of life. \"When I talk about forgiveness, I \nmean letting go, not excusing the other person or reconciling with \nthem or condoning the behavior,\" says Ornish. \"Just letting go of \nyour own suffering.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's a process, not a moment,\" says Dr. Edward M. Hallowell, a \nHarvard psychiatrist and the author of \"Dare to Forgive.\" \nForgiveness, he emphasizes, has to be cultivated; it goes against a \nnatural human tendency to seek revenge and the redress of injustice. \nFor that reason, he recommends doing it with helpof friends, a \ntherapist or through prayer. It was from his faith that John Paul \ndrew the strength to forgive Mehmet Agca, setting (as he no doubt \nintended) an example for the rest of us. The message is the same \nwhether it's couched in the language of Christian charity, clinical \npsychology or the wisdom of Confucius, as quoted by Hallowell: \"If \nyou devote your life to seeking revenge, first dig two graves.\"\u0014",

You fought Ronald Reagan.\u0014\n\u0014\n Youre just anti-America, Falwell said.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoining Falwell and Wallis in the discussion moderated by NBCs Tim \nRussert were former presidential candidate Al Sharpton and Richard \nLand, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Ethics & Religious \nLiberty Commission.\u0014\n\u0014\nLand has been recently criticized after describing the states that \nvoted for President Bush in the recent election as the real America.\u0014\n\u0014\nLand said in a Nov. 20 interview with the Tennessean that Eastern \nliberals were snobby and hostile and try to paint people of \ntraditional religious values and traditional moral values as some \nkind of redneck, Bible-toting bigots.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can want to defend traditional marriage without being a \nhomophobic, Land said. I know thats news to some folks in those \nstates, but theyre the minorities. The country has changed. They \nought to spend more time out there in the red statesin the real \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\nA letter to the editor last Tuesday sought to remind Land that the \nreal America includes both red and blue states.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs much as he would like to exclude liberals from his definition of \nAmerica, liberals are a large and influential part of this country, \nwrote Tom Neilson of Nashville. Lets not forget that nearly half of \nthe country (47 percent) voted for John Kerry in the last \npresidential election.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother letter on Wednesday criticized Land for describing the 2004 \nelection as a contest between parties with traditional morals on \nthe one hand and the 60s counterculture on the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast time I checked, improved access to health care, social justice, \njobs, equality in tax cuts, opposing an untruthful justification for \nwar and restoring Americas integrity arent exactly counterculture \nvalues, said Carey Moore of Nashville.\u0014\n\u0014\nI understand that its in his interest to frame the debate in such a \nfashion, Moore said. But as a leader in one of the countries \nlargest faiths, Mr. Land really should stop bearing false witness \nagainst his neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nSusan Ray of Nashville on Saturday wrote that she thought real \nAmericans were a diverse lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nI guess there are too many stars on our flag now, she wrote in a \nletter to the editor. We need a new flag to represent the real \nAmerica so that all of us who are misinformed can get straightened \nout and fall in step with what America is all about under this \nregime.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Monday the newspaper devoted a Nashville Eye op-ed piece to a \nrebuttal of Land by David Harkness, a retired Presbyterian minister \nwho attended a Southern Baptist college and seminary.\u0014\nIm an Eagle Scout, graduate of Baylor University and Southern \nBaptist Seminary and am now a retired Presbyterian minister, \nHarkness wrote. My wife, a Mississippi College graduate, and I \nraised two wonderful Christian daughters, one a registered nurse, the \nother a teacher. I served 32 months in the Army and was commissioned \nan officer by President Harry Truman. I voted for Dwight D. \nEisenhower, a Republican, and have voted in every election since.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow I learn from you that I am not a real American.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an unreal American saved by Jesus Christ, I find it impossible \nto meditate on His words Blessed are the peacemakers while \nsupporting a pre-emptive, unnecessary war against an undefined enemy, \nordered by a president who claims to be led by God, that has killed \nclose to 150,000 innocent Iraqi people and more than 1,200 U.S. \nsoldiers, seriously injuring tens of thousands more people. And $200 \nbillion of taxpayers money? How much food, education and medical \ncare could this have provided for Americans?\u0014\n\u0014\nYou expend enormous amounts of energy to protect the unborn while \ncollateral damage in Iraq has slain thousands of women, many \npregnant, and killed or maimed thousands of little children, \nHarkness said later in the article. What greater hypocrisy can one \npractice?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, Mr. Land, please dont ask me to accept your Jesus. Im content \nto remain an 'unreal American and to seek the true Jesus whose \nmission is redemption, forgiveness and love which, if taken \nseriously, could indeed heal our serious polarization and make of all \nof us--reds and blues--reconciled real American sisters and brothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Deweese of the Brentwood-based Baptist History and Heritage \nSociety had a letter in Sundays paper saying the Land interview \nreveals what SBC leaders really stand for today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese leaders talk traditional Baptist values, Deweese said. What \nthey actually practice is anti-traditional faith that is \nnationalized, politicized, militarized, chauvinized, fundamentalized \nand opportunized.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "FIERCE GOODBYE",
    "words": "Fierce Goodbye: Living in the Shadow of Suicide\u0014\nReview by David Neff | posted 01/04/05\u0014\n\u0014\nSuicide is not uncommon. Every year in the United States, about \n734,000 people try to take their own lives. Approximately 30,000 \nsucceed, creating about 350,000 suicide survivors. That's enough \ntragedy to touch nearly everyone at some point in their life. Yet, \nthe aftermath of suicide is not frequently discussed, and those who \nsuddenly find themselves mourning a loved one have few resources to \nhelp them navigate the experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nFierce Goodbye, a documentary produced by Mennonite Media, is one of \nthose rare resources. The program is hosted by Judy Collins, the folk \nsinger whose 1970 album Whales and Nightingales made Amazing Grace \nfamous outside the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat qualifies Collins for this task is not her vocal career, but her \npersonal experience. In 1992, Collins' only son, 33-year-old Clark, \ncommitted suicide. Collins also once attempted suicide, making her \ndoubly a survivor. Her book Sanity and Grace addresses her spiritual \njourney following Clark's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nFolk singer Judy Collins, who lost a son to suicide, hosts the program\u0014\n\u0014\nFierce Goodbye is not only for family members. It is also for pastors \nand seminarians, friends and fellow church membersanyone who has to \nrelate to those left behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 42-minute documentary introduces five families and their stories. \nWe listen to parents and siblings and in-laws and clergy talk about \nhow they dealt with the uniquely painful grief associated with the \nsuicide of a loved one. But that short program only begins to suggest \nthe themes and questions that permeate the grief that follows a \nsuicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can I talk about my loss? Do I dare? Would anyone understand? \nWould my loved one still be alive if only I had done something \ndifferent? Where is he or she now? Are they eternally lost, or does \nGod's love somehow reach them even in this darkest of moments?\u0014\n\u0014\nFierce Goodbye takes seriously the religious context of many suicide \nsurvivors, and gives glimpses of how these families and their \nchurches came to deal with the faith questions. The participants come \nfrom a variety of religious backgrounds, including hints of Baptist, \nCatholic, Mennonite, Presbyterian, Orthodox, and Jewish backgrounds \nand beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nVideo is an excellent medium for helping you feel a connection to \nsomeone else's experience. It is a relatively poor medium for \nconveying information or for exploring ideas. Nevertheless, the \nreligious questions are helpfully dealt with in the DVD's bonus \nmaterials.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Dr. G. Lloyd Carr, professor emeritus of biblical and \ntheological studies at Gordon College, we learn that the Bible \nnowhere condemns a suicide. Those who take their lives may be \ncondemned for some other sin (such as Judas's archetypal betrayal), \nbut not for the suicide itself.\u0014\nThe filmmakers videotape one family at the cemetary\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Carr, the earliest theologian to condemn suicide itself \nwas Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354-430). It seems that his mentor \nAmbrose of Milan had praised as martyrs Christian women who took \ntheir own lives rather than allow pagan men to rob them of their \nvirtue. Augustine didn't buy Ambrose's line of thought and began to \nteach that suicide was self-murder, and there could be no forgiveness \nfor that murder since the suicide had no opportunity for repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat teaching has been dominant in the Christian church until the \ntwentieth century. The modern understanding of mental illness has \nseriously modified the way many pastors and theologians treat the \nsubject of suicide. Suicide is often linked with serious depression, \nand many say that the diminished capacity that is a symptom of such \nmental illness means we should think of such deaths as the result of \ndisease rather than wickedness.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrthodox theologian Stanley Harakas relates the clear teaching of the \nchurch: life is a gift from God and it is a sin to usurp God's \nauthority over our lives. Anyone who takes his own life out of a \nphilosophy that asserts human authority over divine right is \ncommitting a serious sin. But, says Harakas, the church understands \nthe diminished moral capacity of those with mental illness, and if a \nphysician certifies that the one who committed suicide was suffering \nfrom such an illness, an Orthodox bishop will usually give a pastor \npermission to give the person a Christian burial.\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Marcia Zimmerman gives a parallel account from a Jewish \nperspective. The Jewish community reveres the 960 suicide-martyrs of \nMasada (just as Ambrose revered the virgin suicides). But Judaism's \nfundamental value is expressed in the command: \"Choose life.\" Thus \nour lives are not our own to take. Rabbi Daniel Roberts contrasts the \nhigh value that Jewish religion puts on life with the religion of \nEgypt, which focused on death and the afterlife. Rabbi Zimmerman \nexplains the pastoral loophole in the law: In many Orthodox Jewish \ncommunities today, there is a presumption that anyone who tries to \ncommit suicide immediately regrets his action and wills to live. \nThus, it is the drugs or the noose that causes death, but it is not \ntechnically suicide. When Jewish communities give their suicides this \nbenefit of the doubt, they are then free to give them a proper Jewish \nburial.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the clergy interviewed stress the wrongness of taking one's own \nlife, while stressing the all-embracing love of God and the likely \ndiminished capacity of the suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are a pastor or counselor or other caregiver, you should watch \nFierce Goodbye. But pay special attention to the DVD's bonus \nmaterials. Not only are the religious questions dealt with in more \ndepth, but so are the family stories, the process of healing, the \nimportance of support groups, the phenomenon of the keen sense of a \nperson's presence after death. There is even an extended interview \nwith Judy Collins, who resists the too-easy administering of \nanti-depressants and prefers natural remedies and alternative \ntherapies for depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nFierce Goodbye lacks drama (though it opens with a re-enactment of a \nsuicide call to a hotline), though it is rich in pathos. The \nconstantly shifting talking heads make it feel fragmented and \ndesultory. And the medium limits the depth in which any dimension of \nthis difficult topic can be pursued. But because video is such a \nuser-friendly medium, this is a good resource for churches, families, \npastors, and seminary classrooms to open the topic and to begin an \nexploration.\u0014\n\u0014\nTalk About It\t  Discussion starters\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Do you know anyone who took their own lifeor tried to do so? If \nthe person was close to you, what was the most helpful thing someone \nsaid to you or did for you?\u0014\n\u0014\n2. If you know someone who committed suicide, was he/she fully \ncapable of making moral decisions and thinking clearly? Or was their \nmoral capacity diminished by a condition such as clinical depression \nor alcoholism?\u0014\n\u0014\n3. If there's been a suicide in your church, did the pastor say \nanything publicly about suicide? If so, what did he say? If not, why \ndon't you think it was addressed publicly?\u0014\n\u0014\n4. What has shaped your own views of suicide?\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Think about two famous suicides in the Bible: Samson (Judges \n16:18-31) and Judas (Matt. 27:1-10). Do you think God could forgive \neither of these for taking his own life?\u0014",

    "title": "FREEING SEX SLAVES: SREY MOM RETURNS TO BROTHEL",
    "words": "SREY MOM RETURNS TO BROTHEL\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: January 22, 2005 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nFreeing Sex Slaves\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's been a year since Nicholas D. Kristof purchased the freedom of \ntwo teenage Cambodian prostitutes. Srey Neth's story was a happy one, \nbut what has happened to Srey Mom?\u0014\n\u0014\nPoipet, Cambodia  After I purchased Srey Mom from her brothel for \n$203 a year ago and brought her back to her village, the joy was \noverwhelming. Her parents and siblings had assumed she was dead, and \nthey shrieked and hugged and cried.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had doubts about the other sex slave I had purchased, Srey Neth, \nwhom I wrote about on Wednesday - and who in fact is thriving and is \nnow preparing to become a hairdresser. But I was pretty sure that \nSrey Mom would make it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I'm devastated to say that a year later, I found Srey Mom back \nhere in the wild town of Poipet, in her old brothel. She's \ndevastated, too - when she spotted me, she ran away to her room in \nthe back of the brothel until she could compose herself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I never lie to people, but I lied to you,\" she said forlornly. \"I \nsaid I would not come back, and I did. I didn't want to return, but I \ndid.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, sadly, such an experience is common. Aid groups find it \nunnerving that they liberate teenagers from the bleak back rooms of a \nbrothel, take them to a nice shelter - and then at night the kids \nsometimes climb over the walls and run back to the brothel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be a tidier world if slaves always sought freedom. But \nprostitutes often are shattered and stigmatized, and sometimes they \nfeel that the only place they can hold their head high is in the \nbrothel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSrey Mom, too, has zero self-esteem, but in her case no one in her \nvillage knew her background, and she was clear of debts. The central \nproblem, as best I can piece together the situation, is that she was \naddicted to methamphetamines, and that craving destroyed her will \npower, sending her fleeing back to the brothel so that she could get \nher drugs.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the last year, an aid group looking after Srey Mom, American \nAssistance for Cambodia, gave her several more chances, once bringing \nher to Phnom Penh to enroll in school to become a hair dresser. But \neach time, Srey Mom fled back to drugs and the brothel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ninety-five percent of the girls take drugs,\" Srey Mom told me. Some \ngirls inject morphine, but brothel owners worry that needle holes \nmake girls look unsightly, so methamphetamine pills are most common.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome brothel owners welcome addiction, because it makes the girls \ndependent upon them. But Srey Mom said that is not true of her \nbrothel owner, Heok Tem, whom she calls \"Mother.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mother doesn't want us to use drugs,\" Srey Mom said. She has an \neerily close relationship with Mrs. Heok Tem, and these days that \nemotional bond keeps her in the brothel as much as do her debts. Mrs. \nHeok Tem seems to feel genuine affection for Srey Mom and truly \nhelped in the effort to get Srey Mom to start a new life, but she \nalso cheats Srey Mom ruthlessly - I examined the brothel's account \nbooks - and rakes in cash by pimping the girl, which exposes her to \nAIDS.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's wrong,\" Mrs. Heok Tem admitted. But for now, she says, she \nneeds the money.\u0014\n\u0014\nSrey Mom still says her dream is to start life over in her village. \n\"I want to go away,\" she said. \"I don't want to stay here long. I'm \nnot happy here. ... I will just look after my younger sisters. I'm \nalready bad, and I don't want them to become bad like me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't believe it will ever happen. I hate to write anyone off, but \nI'm afraid that Srey Mom will remain in the brothel until she is \ndying of AIDS (36 percent of girls in local brothels have H.I.V., and \neventually it catches up with almost all of them). I finally dared \ntell her my fear. I described some young women I had just seen, gaunt \nand groaning, dying of AIDS in Poipet, and I told her I feared she \nwould end up the same way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm afraid of that, too,\" she replied, her voice breaking. \"This is \nan unhappy life. I don't want to do this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe that's what I find saddest about Srey Mom: She is a wonderful, \ngood-hearted girl who gives money to beggars, who offers Buddhist \nprayers for redemption - but who is already so broken that she seems \nunable to escape a world that she hates and knows is killing her.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Bush declared in his inaugural address this week that \"no \none deserves to be a slave\" and that advancing freedom is \"the \ncalling of our time.\" I can't think of a better place to start than \nthe hundreds of thousands of girls trafficked each year, for this \n21st-century version of slavery has not only grown in recent years \nbut is also especially diabolical - it poisons its victims, like Srey \nMom, so that eventually chains are often redundant.\u0014",

In May of 1820, when she was six weeks old, she caught a \ncold, and her eyes became slightly inflamed. The regular physician in \nPutnam County, New York, was out of town, and a man posing as a \ndoctor gave her the wrong treatment. Within days, her eyesight was \ndestroyed, and the man fled town in a panic.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Fanny was never bitter about the stranger's intervention. \"I \nhave not for a moment in more than eighty-five years felt a spark of \nresentment against him, because I have always believed...that the \ngood Lord...by this means consecrated me to the work that I am still \npermitted to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Her devoted Christian parents raised Fanny to be a confident, \nhappy child. She dressed herself, did her own hair, and had \nimpeccable table manners. Known for being a mischief, Fanny spent as \nmuch time as possible climbing trees, riding horses, and playing \npractical jokes on her many friends. \u0014\n\u0014\n     One of the strongest influences in Fanny's childhood was her \ngrandmother. An intelligent and patient woman, she took Fanny on \nnature walks, describing every bud and leaf in meticulous detail. She \nexposed her to great literature and poetry. Most importantly, she \nread her long passages from the Bible every day. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Even with such attentive teaching, Fanny's thirst for knowledge \nwas not satisfied; her mind was phenomenal. Before she was ten years \nold, she had memorized most of the New Testament and more than five \nbooks of the Old Testament. However, since schools at that time were \nnot equipped to teach blind children, she was unable to receive a \nregular education. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Fanny knelt with her grandmother beside her rocker and prayed: \n\"Dear Lord, please show me how I can learn like other children.\" It \nwasn't long before her mother gave her the exciting news about an \nopportunity to attend the New York Institute for the Blind. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Within the year, she was their best student and after graduation \nbecame a teacher. As she grew, poetry became her passion, and she \nfilled every spare moment with writing verse. By the time Fanny was \ntwenty, she was famous throughout New York and a sought-after speaker \nfor poetry recitations and official ceremonies. \u0014\n\u0014\n     In spite of this popularity, she still felt something was \nmissing from her life, and it took a severe cholera epidemic in 1849 \nto show her what that was. More than half of the students at the \nInstitute died, one of them in her arms. After helping to nurse the \nsick for months, she almost succumbed to the disease herself and fled \nto the country. \u0014\n\u0014\n     The deaths of those close to her shook Fanny greatly. Deep in \nher heart, she knew she was not ready to die. On November 20, 1850, \nFanny knelt at the altar at a local revival and gave her heart to \nJesus. Biographer Basil Miller tells her response: \"For the first \ntime I realized that I had been trying to hold the world in one hand \nand the Lord in the other,\" she said. Finally, the God of her \ngrandmother had become real to her.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Her poetry immediately reflected this change in her heart, and \nsongs of praise took the place of regular poems. When she met the \nChristian composer William Bradbury in 1864, the friendship was \nalmost instantaneous. Bradbury furnished the tunes for many of \nFanny's hymns; and though she worked with several composers, their \npartnership was the most enduring. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Fanny usually composed dozens of songs in her head before \ndictating them to a secretary, but no matter what she created, she \nused the same approach. The book More Than Conquerors tells what she \nsaid about her method: \"It may seem a little old-fashioned, always to \nbegin one's work with prayer, but I never undertake a hymn without \nfirst asking the good Lord to be my inspiration.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     She had more speaking invitations than she could keep, and \nfamous men such as President Polk called on her often. With so many \nfriends and associates, she was never lonely. Then in 1858, God \nbrought a special man into her life, the blind musician Alexander Van \nAlstyne. They were married forty-four years and had one child, who \ndied in infancy. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Even in her later years, Fanny stayed as busy as ever, and not \njust with song writing. Always on her heart were those less \nfortunate, and she volunteered much time at local ministries. \nWhenever someone approached her with a question or need, she \nwitnessed to them one-on-one and shared the light of God's Word.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Fanny died peacefully in her home in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on \nFebruary 12, 1915. The crowds at her funeral were a testimony to the \nwide-spread influence she had for the Lord. These words from one of \nher final hymns express the foremost hope of her life: \"And I shall \nsee Him face to face and tell the story - saved by grace.\"\u0014",

    "title": "FOR GAY MEN, AN ATTRACTION TO A DIFFERENT SCENT",
    "words": "For Gay Men, an Attraction to a Different Kind of Scent\u0014\nBy \\NICHOLAS WADE \u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: May 10, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing a brain imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that \nhomosexual and heterosexual men respond differently to two odors that \nmay be involved in sexual arousal, and that the gay men respond in \nthe same way as women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new research may open the way to studying human pheromones, as \nwell as the biological basis of sexual preference. Pheromones, \nchemicals emitted by one individual to evoke some behavior in another \nof the same species, are known to govern sexual activity in animals, \nbut experts differ as to what role, if any, they play in making \nhumans sexually attractive to one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new research, which supports the existence of human pheromones, \n\\is reported in today's issue of The Proceedings of the National \nAcademy of Sciences by Dr. Ivanka Savic and colleagues at the \nKarolinska Institute in Stockholm.\u0014\n\u0014\npplyBrkRulesThe two chemicals in the study were a testosterone \nderivative produced in men's sweat and an estrogen-like compound in \nwomen's urine, both of which have long been suspected of being \npheromones.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost odors cause specific smell-related regions of the human brain to \nlight up when visualized by a form of brain imaging that tracks blood \nflow in the brain and therefore, by inference, sites where neurons \nare active. Several years ago, Dr. Savic and colleagues showed that \nthe two chemicals activated the brain in a quite different way from \nordinary scents. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe estrogen-like compound, though it activated the usual \nsmell-related regions in women, lighted up the hypothalamus in men. \nThis is a region in the central base of the brain that governs sexual \nbehavior and, through its control of the pituitary gland lying just \nbeneath it, the hormonal state of the body.\u0014\nThe male sweat chemical, on the other hand, did just the opposite; it \nactivated mostly the hypothalamus in women and the smell-related \nregions in men. The two chemicals seemed to be leading a double life, \nplaying the role of odor with one sex and of pheromone with another. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Swedish researchers have now repeated the experiment but with the \naddition of gay men as a third group. The gay men responded to the \ntwo chemicals in the same way as did women, Dr. Savic reports, as if \nthe hypothalamus's response is determined not by biological sex but \nby the owner's sexual orientation.\u0014\n\u0014\npplyBrkRulesDr. Savic said that she had also studied gay women, but \nthat the data were \"somewhat complicated\" and not yet ready for \npublication. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe finding is similar to a report in 1991 by Dr. Simon LeVay that a \nsmall region of the hypothalamus is twice as large in straight men as \nin women or gay men. The brain scanning technique used by the Swedish \nresearchers lacks the resolution to see the region studied by Dr. \nLeVay, which is a mere millimeter or so across. But both findings \nsuggest that the hypothalamus is organized in a way related to sexual \norientation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new finding, if confirmed, would break ground in two important \ndirections, those of human pheromones and human sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nMice are known to influence each other's sexual behavior through \nemission of chemicals that act like hormones on the recipient's brain \nand so are known as pheromones. Hopes by the fragrance industry, \namong others, of finding human pheromones were dashed several years \nago when it emerged that a tiny structure in the nose through which \nmice detect many pheromones, the vomeronasal organ, is largely \ninactive in humans, having lost its nervous connection with the \nbrain. \u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers interpreted that to mean that humans, as they evolved to \nrely on sight more than smell, had no need of the primitive cues that \npass for sexual attractiveness in mice. But a role for human \npheromones could not be ruled out, especially in light of findings \nthat women living or working together tend to synchronize their \nmenstrual cycles.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome researchers see Dr. Savic's work as strong evidence in favor of \nhuman pheromones. \"The question of whether human pheromones exist has \nbeen answered. They do,\" wrote the authors of a commentary in Neuron \nabout Dr. Savic's report of 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Catherine Dulac, a Harvard University biologist who studies \npheromones in mice, said that if a chemical modified the function of \nthe hypothalamus, that might be enough to regard it as a pheromone. \nShe said the Swedish study was extremely interesting, even though \n\"humans are a terrible experimental subject.\" She noted, however, \nthat the researchers used a far higher dose of the armpit chemical \nthan anyone would be exposed to in normal life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf human pheromones do exist, Dr. Savic's approach may allow insights \ninto how the brain is organized not just for sexual orientation but \nalso for sexuality in general.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The big question is not where homosexuality comes from, but where \ndoes sexuality come from,\" said Dr. Dean Hamer, a geneticist at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe different pattern of activity that Dr. Savic sees in the brains \nof gay men could be either a cause of their sexual orientation or an \neffect of it. If sexual orientation has a genetic cause, or is \ninfluenced by hormones in the womb or at puberty, then the neurons in \nthe hypothalamus could wire themselves up in a way that permanently \nshapes which sex a person is attracted to.\u0014",

    "words": "Facing an Unwelcome Truth\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can do better when it comes to bearing the burdens of battered \nwomen.\u0014\nby Janice Shaw Crouse | posted 09/27/2005 09:30 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nGloria Steinem, an icon of feminism, often speakswith irony and \nhumorof male oppression and patriarchy. She describes the \npersecution, oppression, and domination women have suffered \nthroughout history at the hands of the Christian church. So goes the \ncriticism of the relationship between Christ's church and women. \nAbuse, and yes, even violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we can't change such one-sided characterizations of the \ninstitution we know represents our risen Lord, our Deliverer from \noppression, we needn't make it so easy for them either.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must face an unwelcome truth: Many of the attacks on the church \ncome from women who have experienced great pain in their lives, \neither because someone in the church caused their pain or they found \nthe church impotent in response. One woman tells of being counseled \nto be \"more submissive\" so that her husband would quit battering her. \nAnother describes a Christian organization covering up the abuse of \nchildren by a powerful executive. Yet another describes her abuser as \na wealthy, well-respected leader in her church and community. Another \nwoman, in telling about her journey of escape from domestic violence, \nreports that when she finally found the courage to approach a pastor, \nhe responded: \"God never gives us more than we can handle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is, of course, true that God gives us grace to handle the \ncircumstances of our lives. However, it is also true that in his \ncalculations of what we can handle, God intends that, in our earthly \nfrailty, we will have earthly support.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians, we are meant to be burden-bearers. We are meant to \nhave a heart for the hopeless, for the weary, for the abused. And \nyet, the church needs to do better in this area. Too often, we have \nhad our heads in the sand.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile recent federal data indicates that family violence has declined \nover the past decade, too many women still suffer violence. An \nestimated 1.8 million women are assaulted each year by the men they \nlive withmostly by boyfriends. Husbands account for only about 2 \npercent of violent attacks on women; strangers account for 44 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only hope of redeeming those who suffer is through the love of \nChrist. And how will they learn the source of hope except through the \nbody of Christ, his church?\u0014\nAnd yet, our churches are not always safe havens.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial respectabilityand outward pietydon't indicate the condition \nof the human heart. Jeremiah expressed wisdom for the ages: \"The \nheart is deceitful and desperately wicked.\" Depravity easily coexists \nwith respectability, sometimes for a very long time.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't want to believe it, but in the church we should be able to \nface that truth squarely. Even God's beloved King David became a \nmurderer when he wanted Bathsheba. Scripture includes that story, and \nothers like it, to remind us of what the human heart is capable.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Scripture begins with a tale of violence, brother against \nbrother, and ends with the vindication of the oppressed when Christ \nreturns in glory to wipe away all tears. The psalmist tells us in the \ninterregnum to:\u0014\n\u0014\nVindicate the weak and fatherless;\u0014\nDo justice to the afflicted and\u0014\ndestitute.\u0014\nRescue the weak and needy;\u0014\nDeliver them out of the hand of the wicked.\u0014\nPsalm 82:3-4\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have a job to do. Paul told the Galatians, \"Bear ye one another's \nburdens.\" This was, Paul said, \"the law of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe weak and powerless are among ussometimes just in the next pew. \nSome are so cowed by the hand of the wicked that they don't know how \nto get help.\u0014\n \u0014\nScripture uses the marriage relationship as a primary tutorial of \nChrist's love for us. The church is the bride of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis bride is not meant to be batteredneither are any of her members!\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we leave victims with nowhere to escape, the serpent will sidle up \nto them, spreading his evil snare by saying, \"You're worthless. \nYou're worthless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No,\" the church replies. \"You are created in the image of God. You \ndeserve our care and protection.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJanice Shaw Crouse, senior fellow of Concerned Women for America's \nBeverly LaHaye Institute, writes regularly on cultural, family, and \nreligious issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today. \u0014\nOctober 2005, Vol. 49, No. 10, Page 87\u0014",

He is so much more than any of us \ncould say,\" Oneto said. \"He was a wonderful man who loved everyone \nand his loss is going to devastate this whole community.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOneoto-Sikorski was serving in Iraq with the 155th Brigade Combat \nTeam with the mother of his children, Clare Ranger. The 155th, which \nis made up of about 3,500 Mississippi National Guard soldiers and \nothers from more than a dozen states, is scheduled to begin returning \nin waves from Iraq by the end of the year.\u0014\n  \u0014\nWhile in Iraq, storm surge from the hurricane flooded both his \nmother's home and his own. But in one of their last phone \nconversations, they looked to the future and talked about his \nhomecoming.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I told him, 'Please be careful, you just have two more months. You \njust have two more months,'\" Oneto said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe back-to-back tragedy has fueled anger for some in \nOneto-Sikorski's family. Like other hurricane victims, the family has \nhad a difficult time getting relief and his mother is still waiting \nfor a trailer from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his \naunt, Eloise Kindja.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What more does she have to give to the country?\" Kindja asked. \"She \ngave her only son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for Oneto, coping with the loss of her home has taken a backseat \nfor now. Her grandchildren - ages 6, 8 and 11 - are staying with \nrelatives near Memphis, Tenn., where they evacuated from the \nhurricane. She wants to make sure they remember their father.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm going to do my best to make sure his kids never want for \nanything, and they remember him for the honorable and brave man that \nhe was,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2005 The Associated Press.

    "title": "FROM GOOD TO GREAT",
    "words": "Jim Collins' book, Good to Great, has become a new Bible for doing \nbusiness. Collins outlines the results of his research into companies \nthat have moved up from decent business results to spectacular growth \nover an extended period of time. Among the seven qualities or traits \nCollins and his researchers found exhibited in these breakaway \ncompanies, one of the most important is what Collins calls \"Level \nFive Leadership.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of \"Level Five Leadership\" begs us to ask what are the other \nfour levels of leadership? In Collins' paradigm they exist as \nfollows: Level One Leadership is personal competence. Those who \ndisplay it give evidence of impressive skills and integrated \nperformance that lifts them to distinction among their peers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLevel Two Leadership is that of a contributing team member. When \npeople work on projects or are assigned to groups, people exhibiting \nthis kind of leadership quality are recognized by the group for both \ntheir relational talents and also for the insights that they bring \ninto the team dynamics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLevel Three Leadership is that of effective management. Those who \nreach this recognition and achievement generally give appropriate \nguidance to systems and divisions that have been set up by others. \nThey may innovate, but primarily within the context of the business \nstructures that have been put in place before their term of service.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLevel Four Leadership occurs when people are given opportunities to \ntake charge of groups or companies and they do so with grace, style, \nand ease. It is an expression of public leadership on terms we are \nusually familiar.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Level Five Leadership is a gift owned within more limited \ncircles. Level Five Leaders, according to Jim Collins, express all of \nthe competencies of levels one through four. To these, however, they \nadd two additional qualities. The first is a paradoxical humility \nthat does not wrap up self-identity with the leadership position, and \nthe other is a tenacious commitment to the outcomes of the \nenterprise. Level Five Leaders own responsibility for the \norganization, but without egomaniacal posturing. They identify their \nlife's purposes with that of the organization so that others \nunderstand the symbiotic fit. They are not here for a short while in \norder to make a name for themselves or to reap the windfall of \nprofits and inflated salaries; they are in for the duration because \nthey understand the needs and dynamics of the company.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese levels of leadership, even though derived from a business \nmodel, may help to explain the uniqueness of Moses in Israel and the \nmodel he established in Deuteronomy 18. They many also help people \nunderstand what it was that Paul sought to do in his relationship \nwith the recalcitrant Corinthian congregation that sapped so much of \nhis energies. And they may certainly create analogies through which \nJesus' early impact on his community and his continued influence on \nthe church and the world may be framed.\u0014",

    "words": "April 21, 2006,  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nF.D.A. Dismisses Medical Benefit From Marijuana \u0014\n\u0014\nBy GARDINER HARRIS \u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON, April 20  The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday \nthat \"no sound scientific studies\" supported the medical use of \nmarijuana, contradicting a 1999 review by a panel of highly regarded \nscientists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe announcement inserts the health agency into yet another fierce \npolitical fight.\u0014\n\u0014\nSusan Bro, an agency spokeswoman, said Thursday's statement resulted \nfrom a past combined review by federal drug enforcement, regulatory \nand research agencies that concluded \"smoked marijuana has no \ncurrently accepted or proven medical use in the United States and is \nnot an approved medical treatment.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Bro said the agency issued the statement in response to numerous \ninquiries from Capitol Hill but would probably do nothing to enforce \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Any enforcement based on this finding would need to be by D.E.A. \nsince this falls outside of F.D.A.'s regulatory authority,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nEleven states have legalized medicinal use of marijuana, but the Drug \nEnforcement Administration and the director of national drug control \npolicy, John P. Walters, have opposed those laws.\u0014\nA Supreme Court decision last year allowed the federal government to \narrest anyone using marijuana, even for medical purposes and even in \nstates that have legalized its use. \u0014\n\u0014\nCongressional opponents and supporters of medical marijuana use have \neach tried to enlist the F.D.A. to support their views. \nRepresentative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana and a fierce \nopponent of medical marijuana initiatives, proposed legislation two \nyears ago that would have required the food and drug agency to issue \nan opinion on the medicinal properties of marijuana.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Souder believes that efforts to legalize medicinal uses of \nmarijuana are a front for efforts to legalize all uses of it, said \nMartin Green, a spokesman for Mr. Souder. \u0014\n\u0014\nTom Riley, a spokesman for Mr. Walters, hailed the food and drug \nagency's statement, saying it would put to rest what he called \"the \nbizarre public discussion\" that has led to some legalization of \nmedical marijuana.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Food and Drug Administration statement directly contradicts a \n1999 review by the Institute of Medicine, a part of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious scientific \nadvisory agency. That review found marijuana to be \"moderately well \nsuited for particular conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea \nand vomiting and AIDS wasting.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. John Benson, co-chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee \nthat examined the research into marijuana's effects, said in an \ninterview that the statement on Thursday and the combined review by \nother agencies were wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe federal government \"loves to ignore our report,\" said Dr. Benson, \na professor of internal medicine at the University of Nebraska \nMedical Center. \"They would rather it never happened.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome scientists and legislators said the agency's statement about \nmarijuana demonstrated that politics had trumped science. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the F.D.A. making \npronouncements that seem to be driven more by ideology than by \nscience,\" said Dr. Jerry Avorn, a medical professor at Harvard \nMedical School.\u0014\nRepresentative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat who has \nsponsored legislation to allow medicinal uses of marijuana, said the \nstatement reflected the influence of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, which he said had long pressured the F.D.A. to help \nin its fight against marijuana.\u0014\nA spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration referred \nquestions to Mr. Walters's office.\u0014\nThe Food and Drug Administration's statement said state initiatives \nthat legalize marijuana use were \"inconsistent with efforts to ensure \nthat medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the \nF.D.A. approval process.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut scientists who study the medical use of marijuana said in \ninterviews that the federal government had actively discouraged \nresearch. Lyle E. Craker, a professor in the division of plant and \nsoil sciences at the University of Massachusetts, said he submitted \nan application to the D.E.A. in 2001 to grow a small patch of \nmarijuana to be used for research because government-approved \nmarijuana, grown in Mississippi, was of poor quality.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2004, the drug enforcement agency turned Dr. Craker down. He \nappealed and is awaiting a judge's ruling. \"The reason there's no \ngood evidence is that they don't want an honest trial,\" Dr. Craker \nsaid.\u0014\nDr. Donald Abrams, a professor of clinical medicine at the University \nof California, San Francisco, said he had studied marijuana's \nmedicinal effects for years but had been frustrated because the \nNational Institutes of Health, the leading government medical \nresearch agency, had refused to finance such work. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith financing from the State of California, Dr. Abrams undertook \nwhat he said was a rigorous, placebo-controlled trial of marijuana \nsmoking in H.I.V. patients who suffered from nerve pain. Smoking \nmarijuana proved effective in ameliorating pain, Dr. Abrams said, but \nhe said he was having trouble getting the study published. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"One wonders how anyone\" could fulfill the Food and Drug \nAdministration request for well-controlled trials to prove \nmarijuana's benefits, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarinol, a synthetic version of a marijuana component, is approved to \ntreat anorexia associated with AIDS and the nausea and vomiting \nassociated with cancer drug therapy.\u0014\n\u0014\nGW Pharmaceutical, a British company, has received F.D.A. approval to \ntest a sprayed extract of marijuana in humans. Called Sativex, the \ndrug is made from marijuana and is approved for sale in Canada. \nOpponents of efforts to legalize marijuana for medicinal uses suggest \nthat marijuana is a so-called gateway drug that often leads users to \ntry more dangerous drugs and to addiction. \u0014\nBut the Institute of Medicine report concluded there was no evidence \nthat marijuana acted as a gateway to harder drugs. And it said there \nwas no evidence that medical use of marijuana would increase its use \namong the general population.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Daniele Piomelli, a professor of pharmacology at the University \nof California, Irvine, said he had \"never met a scientist who would \nsay that marijuana is either dangerous or useless.\"\u0014\nStudies clearly show that marijuana has some benefits for some \npatients, Dr. Piomelli said. \u0014\n\"We all agree on that,\" he said.\u0014",

    "words": "For Shame?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Christians should welcome, rather than stigmatize, unwed mothers \nand their children.\u0014\nby Amy Laura Hall \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the gospel is to make a difference in our culture, surely it will \ncome as a surprise, rather than simply echoing entrenched political \npositions. Few Christian ethicists today are better at surprising \ntheir readers, and the wider world, than Amy Laura Hall, the director \nof the doctor of theology program at Duke Divinity School. She has \nbeen willing to challenge utilitarian forms of medical research that \nundergird the modern university's power and prestige. Her arguments \nagainst embryonic stem-cell research have found a wide hearing, \npartly because she combines a fierce commitment to the dignity of the \nleast human being with a keen feminist awareness of the implications \nof runaway medical hubris for women and families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are few ethicists working today who combine publicly accessible \narguments with such a consistent Christian witness. Here, though, her \nanswer to our big questionHow can followers of Christ be a \ncounterculture for the common good?may surprise and challenge a \ndifferent set of readers, as she looks at the history of Christian \nattitudes toward unwed mothers and their children, and calls us to a \ndifferent future.\u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, had a way with \nwords. In 1922, she wrote a book chapter titled \"The Cruelty of \nCharity.\" Charity toward the poor, especially toward poor immigrants, \nshe opined, only \"encourages the healthier and more normal sections \nof the world to shoulder the burden of unthinking and indiscriminate \nfecundity of others, which brings with it  a dead weight of human \nwaste.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an age when upstanding Congregationalists and Unitarians were \nurging Americans to produce Fewer and Better Babies (Eugenics \nPublishing House, 35th edition, 1929), Sanger was in step with the \ntimes. By mid-century, most mainstream Protestant leaders agreed that \nthe nation needed to calibrate carefully the number and type of \nbabiesand immigrantsallowed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne central means for ensuring the careful calibration of procreation \nwas shame. Indeed, the author of Fewer and Better Babies anticipated \nthat working-class parents who produced more than two children would \neventually be considered \"anti-social, as criminal members of the \ncommunity.\" The anti-immigration and birth-control movements during \nthe first half of the 20th century were linked by the sense that some \npeople were beneath human dignity and would pollute \"native stock \nAmerican\" bloodlines. The growing consensus during this era was \nsummed up by the words of a Methodist clergyman from Missouri, \nwriting for the Methodist Quarterly Review: \"We should demand that \neach child born is worthy of a place in our midst.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the most blatant use of shame I have found in my work on the \nhistory of reproduction and domesticity in the U.S. does not come \nfrom the eugenicists of 60 years ago. It comes from the National \nCampaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a 21st-century effort. Pictures \nposted in high schools and featured in teen magazines show a Latina \ngirl with \"CHEAP\" emblazoned across her body. The African American \ngirl is labeled \"REJECT,\" the Asian girl \"DIRTY,\" and the \nworking-class white girl \"NOBODY.\" The very fine print places these \nlabels in a different contextrecommending \"cheap\" condoms, for \nexample. But the overwhelming effect of the design is bold-print \nhumiliation, suggesting that teenage mothers are cheap, dirty \nnobodies, social rejects with no future and with little hope for \ntheir children. The stark photos are reminiscent of social-hygiene \nposters from the eugenic era, cultivating a potent combination of \ndisdain and fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nPossibly the most troubling of the posters features a white boy whose \nsexual activity resulted in an unexpected pregnancy. He is labeled \n\"USELESS,\" and the fine print reads: \"My scholarship is USELESS. Now \nI need a job to support my baby.\" Taken together, the posters convey \na deeply problematic message. The college boy who leaves behind his \nscholarship to take care of the CHEAP REJECT's baby is USELESS.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe board of directors for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen \nPregnancy includes CEOs from major corporations and leaders from both \npolitical parties, representing a broad consensus across the United \nStates, as well as leading members of the black and Hispanic \ncommunities. The urgency of eliminating teenage pregnancy is one of \nthe few matters on which conservatives and liberals agree, and the \nstakes are deemed sufficiently high to warrant the use of brute shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nSexy Doublespeak\u0014\nAnother national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy is sponsored by \nthe Candie's Foundation, linked to a trendy line of handbags, \nsunglasses, bikinis, and sandals. The foundation's website speaks a \npredictable, nonsensical language of free-flowing, responsible sex \nappeal. \"Think of what you can achieve if you don't conceive\"this \nruns as a refrain as various celebrities vogue for the camera. \nCandie's encourages viewers to \"be sexy\" (no doubt with the aid of \nCandie's accessories), but not to have sex. This directive is always \nfollowed with a caveat: If you do have sex, use birth control, or \nelse you will suffer \"the devastating consequences.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne public service announcement produced by Candie's makes it clear \nthat the consequence that can render sex devastating is, in fact, a \nhuman life. With a young couple about to \"do this\" in the back seat \nof a car, former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy arrives to deliver a \ncrying baby into the girl's arms. The boy exits the car in a hurry. \nJenny leaves, too, sneering at the girl with knowing disgust. \n\"Welcome to reality,\" are her departing words. The girl is left \nholding the crying baby, alone, clearly frightened, in the back seat \nof the car.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this truly realitya world where teenage mothers who conceive are \nabandoned to \"devastating consequences\"? Perhaps. I sometimes think \nso when I hear stories of evangelical families who cannot bear the \nshame of an unplanned pregnancy, as I read thinly veiled warnings in \nthe media about the growing number of young, Latina mothers in the \nU.S., and as I dig through the archives of meticulously planned \nreproduction as marketed to mid-20th-century Americans. Throughout \nthat history of planning and parenthood, the word illegitimate bears \nmultiple layers of stigma and shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I have come to believe that Christians are called to be a \ncounterculture for the common good in no small part by refusing to \ndeclare any life in our midst illegitimate.\u0014\n\u0014\nRisky Commitment\u0014\nChristians are called to a very different kind of double-speak from \nCandie's bikini-chastity chic. We are called to encourage sexual \ndiscipline outside and inside of marriage, while also affirming, in \nthe very same breath, that no pregnancy is outside of God's reach.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean that Christians cannot say it would have been \npreferable had this young woman not shared herself intimately with a \nboy who hardly knew how to appreciate the intricate beauty of her \nbody and the vulnerability of her love. Christians are surely called \nto teach girls and young women that their bodies are not primarily \n\"in waiting\" for sex with a man, but rather actively in service today \nfor the work of the Holy Spirit. But as we affirm the blessings of \nholy chastity, we must also consider the incipient life embedded \ninside an image-bearer of God as within the purview of God's \nprovidence. A young couple's coupling in the backseat is morally \nbarren (even if ultimately procreative), because it is outside the \nsacramental gift of marriage. Yet the pregnancy conceived by such a \ncouple in the backseat (even if it is ill-conceived) is well within \nthe reach of God's profligate grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the last century in the United States, many mainline \nProtestant leaders, committed to the eugenics movement, deemed it \ntheir business to determine which births were with the grain of God's \nplan for the evolving progress of human history and which births were \na drag on the movement forward. Christians are called to more \nhumility and more confidence than thatmore humility about the \ngrievous harm that has been done in the name of social progress, and \nmore confidence in God's ability to turn even regrettable human \nchoices to good.\u0014\n\u0014\nHappily, many Christian churches are already offering a different \n\"welcome to reality\" than the one offered by Jenny McCarthy. These \ncongregations, neighborhoods, and kinship networks name the girls in \nthe poster shame-campaign to be children of promise, worthy \nrecipients of hands-on care and communal sacrifice. They refuse the \ncalculus of life that draws a distinction between accidental and \nprovidential babies, between the right sorts of people and those \nsorts of people with teenage mothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are such congregations, but I believe that, in answer to God's \ncall, there could be many more.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch advocacy, born of holy double-speak, is a stretch for many in my \ncohort of Christianity. But it is not so much a stretch for many \nAfrican American congregations and Latino Catholic communities. It is \nmy prayer that more mainstream evangelicals, in both \"red\" America \nand \"blue\" America, will cross over into risky solidarity with a \nthird color of Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe could do so by advocating for and working within alternative high \nschools where pregnant girls may continue their education. We could \nwork for maternity leave and flexible schedules at all levels of \neducation and enterprise, especially at institutions overtly \ncommitted to Christian witness. To be a people committed to the \nincalculable gift of life may mean myriad commitments that interrupt \nour plans for our own families. It may mean that a young couple \nwithout children find themselves babysitting a child not their blood \nkin several evenings a week, rather than watching their favorite \nscience fiction series on DVD. A single man may find himself fixing a \nyoung single mother's clogged sink on a lunch break or building her \ntoddler a swing set during a holiday weekend. For many mothers and \nfathers, it may mean adapting their entire life and career to care \ndaily for an unexpected grandchild. And by my own political \nreckoning, witnessing for the common good not only means hands-on \nlocal action, but also advocating for systematic acts of mercy \nthrough a matrix of services to offer single mothers a safety net of \ncare.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter hearing me give a talk on abortion, eugenics, and teenage \npregnancy, my oldest daughter, with whom I had not yet initiated a \ntalk about birds and bees, looked up at me and said frankly, \"Mom, if \nGod gives me a baby before I am married, I won't worry. I know that \nyou and Dad would take care of it so that I could stay in school.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter taking a deep breath and squeezing back tears of sheer parental \nterror, I agreed that she was right, that we would help her and her \nbaby no matter what. I pray that the situation will not arise, but I \nalso pray that should it arise, her father and I, as well as the \ncongregation into which she has been baptized, will be worthy of her \nconfidence, for to fail her would be contrary to who we hope to be. \nTo fail her would be the true shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Christianity Today.

    "words": "Oct 27, 2:28 PM EDT\u0014\n\u0014\nMich. Mother Found Guilty in Son's Death\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DAVID EGGERT\u0014\nAssociated Press Writer\u0014\n\u0014\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A mother who claimed that her missing \n7-year-old son had run away was found guilty Friday of murder after \nprosecutors said she struck him in the head and then neglected to \nseek help as he slowly died of his injury.\u0014\n\u0014\nLisa Holland cried quietly as jurors found her guilty of first-degree \nfelony murder and child abuse in the death last year of her adopted \nson Ricky. Felony murder carries a mandatory life sentence without \nparole. Sentencing was set for Nov. 28.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer lawyer had told jurors that the real killer was her husband, Tim. \nHe pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, second-degree murder, and \ntestified against his wife. The jury began deliberations on Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ricky disappeared in July 2005, the couple said he ran away, \nsparking an extensive nine-day search by 1,700 volunteers and \nhundreds of law enforcement officers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in January, Tim Holland led police to Ricky's body in an Ingham \nCounty game area and admitted dumping his son's remains. He told \nauthorities his wife hit Ricky in the head with a hammer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defense said Tim Holland, 37, couldn't be trusted because he lied \nmany times to police, the public and the media. He faces up to life \nin prison with the possibility of parole when sentenced Nov. 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the seven-week trial, witnesses portrayed Lisa Holland, 33, as \na cruel mother who abused Ricky by hitting him with a wooden spoon, \nduct-taping him to the refrigerator and making him wear a harness on \nthe school bus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer husband testified that on July 1, 2005, he came home from an \nerrand and found Ricky dead in bed, with vomit and traces of blood \naround his mouth, and his wife screaming she \"didn't mean to do it.\"\u0014\n\t\u0014\nHe said that a week earlier, he had returned from military training \nin Virginia to find the boy with a cut on his head, listless and \nunable to walk. He said he didn't take him to a doctor because he \ndidn't want a confrontation with his wife and thought his son would \nget better.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I didn't want her to start pushing me around in front of the kids,\" \nTim Holland said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prosecution said Ricky likely suffered a brain injury a week or \nmore before he died, and his parents let him die a slow death.\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\t\u0014",

    "words": "Fueled by Fervent Prayer\u0014\nYouth for Christ's praying community sent young Harold Myra on a \nlifetime quest.\u0014\nby Harold Myra\u0014\n\u0014\nFueled by Fervent Prayer\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat transformed me in 1957 from an introverted, self-absorbed high \nschool senior with no college plans into a college student with a \npassion for service, leading a half-dozen Youth for Christ \nhigh-school clubs? A combination of forces invaded my life, chief \namong them the authenticity and fire of prayer. The New Evangelicals \nwere fueled by fervent prayer, and becoming part of YFC meant hours \non one's knees with students and leaders in confession, intercession, \nand calling on God to do mighty works.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's invitation to Jeremiah resonated in my soul: \"Call unto me, and \nI will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things.\" As a \nchild, I had prayed earnestly, and as a teen had experienced some \nremarkable \"coincidences,\" but YFC brought a community of intense \nprayer. For instance, during the invitation at Billy Graham's New \nYork Crusade, I was praying for seekers with such obvious intensity \nthat someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I wanted to go \nforward.\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly, YFC's first full-time employee, had a rich history of fervent \nprayer, especially at his crossroads moments. The same with Harold \nOckenga; his mother's prayers and his own wrestlings with God formed \na lifetime of commitment to prayer. Near the end of Ockenga's life, \nwe interviewed him for Christianity Today. We asked how he had \nsimultaneously functioned as president of Fuller Seminary in \nCalifornia and as pastor of historic Park Street Church in Boston. \nHis immediate answer was to reach for a stack of prayer cards he \nturned to each morning. He would pray about each concern and then \nleave it in God's hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early YFC, however brash or shallow some of its leaders may \nhave been, they joined with hundreds of others asking for God's \nforgiveness, wisdom, and empowerment. We heard countless stories of \nthe power of prayer, including YFC leaders gathering around Billy in \nprayer long into the night, with the result of God's forever after \nblessing his invitations to receive Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1959 I faced a 32-hour bus ride from eastern Pennsylvania to \nKansas City to attend YFC's Director's School. I prayed earnestly \nthat the trip would not be a dreary time-waster but a catalyst for my \ntraining to reach young people.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the bus, I noticed three passengers bond because they were all \ndoing the same tragic thinggoing \"home\" because their spouses had \nrejected them. All were youngan airman just returned from Korea, a \nMexican woman, and a 19-year-old girl, baby in arms.\u0014\n\u0014\nA heavy snowstorm brought unusually good spirits to the bus as we \nstarted singing about snow and travel. Later, in the darkness, I \ntalked and prayed with the beautiful but devastated Mexican woman \nabout her future and her spiritual life. As I write this, I still see \nthe teenage wife with her baby stepping down off the bus to meet her \nparents. The entire trip seemed a dramatic answering of my prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt church a few weeks later, a phrase from a YFC song resonated in my \nsoul, especially in light of the bus ride: \"For who am I, that I \nshould choose my way?\" God, I was determined, must choose my path, \nand that would be possible only through prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer is mysterious, sometimes maddening in its seeming non-results, \nsometimes exhilarating in its sense of genuine connection and \nanswers. Ole Hallesby once said, \"Prayer is for the helpless.\" I \nearly recognized this reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently my friend Philip Yancey published a marvelous book titled \nsimply Prayer. Yancey quotes Karl Barth's observation that \"the most \nactive workers and thinkers and fighters in the divine service in \nthis world have  been the most active in prayer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is exactly what I was drawn into as a young adult, and as with \nGraham and Ockenga, prayer for me has been an essential lifetime \nquest.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarold Myra has been CEO of Christianity Today International since \n1975 and is co-author of CTI's 50th anniversary book, The Leadership \nSecrets of Billy Graham.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History & Biography.\u0014\nIssue 92, Fall 2006, Vol. XXV, No. 4, Page 50\u0014",

    "words": "FALLEN FOUNDER\u0014\nby Nancy Isenberg \u0014\nReview by Lucas A. Powe, Jr.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the traitor Benedict Arnold, no member of the American founding \ngeneration has received a more hostile treatment from historians than \nAaron Burr. Nancy Isenbergs biography, Fallen Founder, the first on \nBurr by a professional historian, sets out to rectify this defect and \nto resurrect the reputation of this intelligent and complex man.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurrs father was the president of the College of New Jersey (now \nPrinceton) and his maternal grandfather was the famous Puritan divine \nJonathan Edwards. After graduating from Princeton, Burr served under \nBenedict Arnold in the Quebec campaign early in the Revolutionary \nWar. By his mid-30s, he was a United States Senator from New York \nwith a seemingly unlimited political future. Then, between 1800 and \n1807, the wheels came off.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking for enough Northern support to defeat John Adams, Thomas \nJefferson selected Burr as his running mate in 1800. Burr insisted \nthat no one withhold votes in the Electoral College and when no one \ndid, he and Jefferson tied. Due to a defect in the Constitution \n(corrected by the Twelfth Amendment), the tie threw the race to the \nHouse of Representatives where voting was by state. Due to a second \ndefect (also corrected by the Twentieth Amendment), the House that \ndecided the election was a lame duck body largely elected in 1798. \nThat meant that Federalists controlled the House even though they had \nbeen repudiated in the 1800 elections. Burr should have conceded the \npresidency to Jefferson. Instead he stuck in through 36 ballots until \nthe Federalists allowed the will of the people to prevail. Burrs \nrelationship with Jefferson was thus ruptured at the beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone knows the outcome of the most famous duel in American \nhistory was Burr killing Alexander Hamilton in 1804. His political \ncareer was over (and for some time he stayed away from New York and \nNew Jersey).\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung, intelligent, and ambitious, Burr needed something to do and \nthis is where the Burr conspiracy enters. To this day no one knows \nexactly what Burr intended to do. The possibilities are: (1) separate \nthe Western states from the rest of the Union and become their \npresident; (2) filibuster against Spanish territory and become the \nemperor of whatever was taken; (3) filibuster against Spanish \nterritory and add the conquered lands to the United States when the \nlatter wished. Isenberg believes it was the third option; Jefferson \ndid not. He ordered Burr arrested and charged with treason, and only \nJohn Marshalls rulings at trial saved Burr from the gallows.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurr is an apt subject for a biography. He lived another three \ndecades after his acquittal on the charge of treason, had lots of \nfriends (and enemies), was the one feminist among the early leaders \nof the Republic (as well as a womanizer), and has been ignored by \nhistorians (with his papers mostly destroyed and outliving his \nposterity)the best previous biography of Burr was Gore Vidals \n1973 novel. Nevertheless, Fallen Founder did not persuade this \nreviewer that Burr has gotten a bum rap. What it did offer was a \nwell-written, well-researched, controversial biography of a truly \ninteresting founder. 560 pages  6 1/8\" x 9 1/4\"\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u0014\nNancy Isenberg is the Mary Frances Barnard Chair in 19th Century \nAmerican History at the University of Tulsa. She is the author of Sex \nand Citizenship in Antebellum America.\u0014",

    "words": "Cross Purposes\u0014\nBiggest Christian conference splits amid growing atonement debate.\u0014\nMadison Trammel | 7/02/2007 \u0014\n\u0014\nThree of Great Britain's most prominent Christian groups have ended \ntheir 14-year conference partnership, scuttling the annual Word Alive \nyouth event. At issue was disagreement over a speaker, the Rev. Steve \nChalke.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut below the surface simmers a theological controversy that \nthreatens to split the country's evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpring Harvest's namesake conference, the largest Christian event in \nthe country, draws about 55,000 people each year to a multi-site, \nmulti-week lineup. The organization recently asked that Keswick \nMinistries and the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship \n(UCCF) be willing to put Chalke, a member of Spring Harvest's council \nof management, on the student- and family-focused platform they \nco-host. When the ministries balked, Spring Harvest cancelled the \nevent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Word Alive committee, in good conscience, just didn't feel it \nwould be appropriate, during that week, for Steve Chalke to be given \na platform,\" said UCCF communications director Pod Bhogal. \"Steve \nChalke has made his dislike of penal substitution really, really \nclear, and  we didn't feel the nature of the atonement was one of \nthose things you could agree to disagree over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChalke's theology first came into question in 2003 with the \npublication of his book The Lost Message of Jesus. In it, Chalke, the \nsenior minister of Church.co.uk and founder of Oasis Trust and \nFaithworks, compared the prevailing Protestant view of the atonement \nto divine child abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[W]ouldn't it be inconsistent for God to warn us not to be angry \nwith each other and yet burn with wrath himself [against sin and \nsinners]?\" he later wrote in an article defending his position. \"I, \nfor one, believe that God practices what he preaches.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Faith and the American Founding\u0014\n\u0014\nThough connoisseurs of the culture war appreciate fresh servings of \nthe religion-versus-science staple, they may have an even greater \ncraving for simplistic pronouncements about America's founding \ngeneration.\u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, scholars have produced outstanding work in recent years \non the question of early American intentions about the relationship \nbetween religion and politics. Philip Hamburger's masterful \nSeparation of Church and State leads the way. Daniel Dreisbach, \nSteven D. Smith, Patricia Bonomi, Michael Novak, and many others have \nalso contributed to the public understanding of the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher S. Grenda, writing in the Journal of Law and Religion \n(volume XXII, number 2), eschews propaganda. Grenda's article, \n\"Religious Culture & Natural Rights: Understanding the 'Paradox' of \nEarly America,\" explains that there was not necessarily a dichotomy \nbetween secular Lockean liberal thinking and devout Christianity on \nthe matter of established churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe demonstrates the organic union of the two schools of thought and \nthe complexity of early American thinking about church-state \nseparation with two examplesBritish Americans Jonathan Dickinson of \nNew Jersey and Elisha Williams of Connecticut. They combined Lockean \nand Christian worldviews in their cases against the American legal \nestablishment. Further on, Grenda posits human degeneracy as an \nargument against state-established churchesa significant and \nunderexplored line of thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrenda's conclusion goes straight to the heart of the matter: We \ncannot understand the founding of America if we think of Christianity \nas some anti-rational appendage that rode along with Enlightenment \nthinking. Neither can we satisfy ourselves with pointing to this \nfounder or that one and claiming that the beliefs of Jefferson, \nMadison, or Henry carried the day. The reality is that we have a \n\"complex cultural inheritance\" to explore.\u0014",

    "title": "FIVE KINDS OF CHRISTIANS IN AMERICA",
    "words": "A Broad and Diverse Bloc\u0014\nNew research shows five kinds of Christians in America.\u0014\nby Eric Reed, Leadership managing editor\u0014\n\u0014\nA new report in the Fall issue of Leadership journal shows great \ndisparity among people in the United States who call themselves \n\"Christian.\" In fact, this nationwide survey of more than 1,000 \nself-identified adherents reveals five distinct types of \npractitioners with very different views on salvation, the Bible, \nmorality, and the cultural impact of their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor news reporters and news consumers, this diversity requires \ncareful attention to the variety of opinion among people generally \nlabeled \"Christian.\" Not all Christians think alike on cultural \nissues, and the survey makes the reasons clearer.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor church leaders, the identification of five approaches to faith \nmay make theological discussion and the faith-sharing common to \nevangelical believers more coherent. With this survey, the common \nground among Christians becomes more evident, but so do the areas of \ndisagreement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey was conducted for Christianity Today International \n(publisher of Leadership journal) and Zondervan Publishers by the \nresearch firm Knowledge Networks. It is one step in the development \nof NationalChristianPoll.com, a new research database for surveying \nthe opinions of Christians in the United States on a variety of \nissues.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho Are my Christian Neighbors?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile between 70 and 80 percent of people in the United States \nidentify themselves as Christian according to a number of studies, \nwhat those people mean by the term varies widely. Respondents to our \nnew survey were almost evenly divided among five categories:\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Active Christians (19%): Committed churchgoers, often in \npositions of church leadership; believe salvation comes through Jesus \nChrist; Bible readers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Professing Christians (20%): Similar beliefs to Active \nChristians, but less committed to church attendance; focus more on \npersonal relationship with God and Jesus, less on Bible reading or \nfaith sharing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Liturgical Christians (24%): High level of spiritual activity; \nregular churchgoers, recognizing the authority of the church; \npredominantly Catholic and Lutheran.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Private Christians (24%): Largest and youngest segment; believe \nin God and have spiritual interest, but not within the church \ncontext; only one-third attend church at all, almost none are church \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Cultural Christians (21%): God aware, but do not view Jesus as \nessential to salvation; affirm many ways to God; express little \noutward religious behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nTalking their Talk\u0014\nThe categorization used in this survey does not employ the commonly \nused terms \"evangelical,\" \"fundamentalist,\" or \"mainline\" because \nsome Christians who are often defined by those terms landed in all \nfive of our categories. What that may show us is that the traditional \nlabels are losing their distinctiveness in today's shifting religious \nlandscape.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur categories are based on actions as well as professed beliefs. \nThey also provide good starting points for faith-oriented \ndiscussions. Rather than the customary presentations of the gospel \nbased on \"roads\" and \"laws,\" a series of questions may be more \neffective openers for talks with Liturgical, Private, and Cultural \nChristians:\u0014\n\u0014\n    * How does your faith affect your behavior?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * How would our country be different if most people believed and \nbehaved as you do?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * What is the role of the church in helping people grow to be \nmore like Jesus Christ?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    * And ultimately, What do you believe about Jesus?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe found that almost 9 in 10 Active and Professing Christians said \n\"accepting Christ as Savior and Lord\" is key to being a Christian, \nwhile Liturgical, Private, and Cultural Christians favored a more \ngeneral \"believing in God\" as important to being a Christian. For \nhalf or more of the people in America who call themselves \n\"Christian,\" Christ is not the defining figure in their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nImplications for Church Leaders\u0014\nIn her extended report for Leadership journal, Helen Lee draws \nseveral conclusions important to church leaders. Here are two of them:\u0014\n\u0014\n     The local church is no longer considered the only outlet for \nspiritual growth.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In fact, only two types of Christians, Active and Liturgical, \nhold to a model for spiritual growth that is centered in church life. \nThe others conduct much of their spiritual growth activities outside \nthe church. Professing Christians have a spiritual growth ethic that \nis still Christ-centered, but the survey shows Private Christians and \nCultural Christians identify many activities as means of personal \nspiritual development, including service and recreation, that are not \nconnected to church, the Bible, or even to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Churches must develop relational- and community-oriented \noutreach.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The accuracy of reports that church attendance in the U.S. has \nheld steady since just after World War II is suspect when we factor \nthe declining appreciation for the church, especially among younger \npeople. The growing house-church movement and the increase in \nspirituality that is not based in church life are two indications \nthat churches must find new ways to reach new congregants. Today's \nChristians place high value on relationships and personal community. \nThese are the new frontiers for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Leadership Journal.\u0014",

She wrote so \nmany that she was forced to use pen names lest the hymnals be filled \nwith her name above all others. And, for most people, the most \nremarkable thing about her was that she had done so in spite of her \nblindness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think it is a great pity that the Master did not give you sight \nwhen he showered so many other gifts upon you,\" remarked one \nwell-meaning preacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nTimeline\u0014\n1806\tSamuel Mills leads Haystack Prayer Meeting\u0014\n1811\tAlexander Campbell begins Restoration Movement\u0014\n1817\tElizabeth Fry organizes relief in Newgate Prison\u0014\n1820\tFanny Crosby born\u0014\n1915\tFanny Crosby dies\u0014\n1924\tFirst Christian radio broadcasts\u0014\n\u0014\nFanny Crosby responded at once, as she had heard such comments \nbefore. \"Do you know that if at birth I had been able to make one \npetition, it would have been that I was born blind?\" said the poet, \nwho had been able to see only for her first six weeks of life. \n\"Because when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden \nmy sight will be that of my Savior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBlinded by a quack\u0014\nBorn in Putnam County, New York, Crosby became ill within two months. \nUnfortunately, the family doctor was away, and another manpretending \nto be a certified doctortreated her by prescribing hot mustard \npoultices to be applied to her eyes. Her illness eventually relented, \nbut the treatment left her blind. When the doctor was revealed to be \na quack, he disappeared. A few months later, Crosby's father died. \nHer mother was forced to find work as a maid to support the family, \nand Fanny was mostly raised by her Christian grandmother.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer love of poetry began earlyher first verse, written at age 8, \nechoed her lifelong refusal to feel sorry for herself:\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, what a happy soul I am,\u0014\nAlthough I cannot see!\u0014\nI am resolved that in this world\u0014\nContented I will be.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many blessings I enjoy\u0014\nThat other people don't,\u0014\nTo weep and sigh because I'm blind\u0014\nI cannot, and I won't!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile she enjoyed her poetry, she zealously memorized the Bible. \nMemorizing five chapters a week, even as a child she could recite the \nPentateuch, the Gospels, Proverbs, the Song of Solomon, and many \npsalms chapter and verse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer mother's hard work paid off. Shortly before her fifteenth \nbirthday, Crosby was sent to the recently founded New York Institute \nfor the Blind, which would be her home for 23 years: 12 as a student, \n11 as a teacher. She initially indulged in her own poetry and was \ncalled upon to pen verses for various occasions. In time the \nprincipal asked her to avoid such \"distractions\" in favor of her \ngeneral instruction. \"We have no right to be vain in the presence of \nthe Owner and Creator of all things,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the work of a traveling phrenologist (one who studies the \nshape and irregularities of the skull for insights into character and \nmental capacity) that changed the school's mind and again ignited her \npassion. Though his study is now the ridicule of science, the \nphrenologist's words were to prove prophetic: \"Here is a poetess. \nGive her every possible encouragement. Read the best books to her and \nteach her the finest that is in poetry. You will hear from this young \nlady some day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPoetry for presidents\u0014\nIt didn't take long. By age 23 Crosby was addressing Congress and \nmaking friendships with presidents. In fact, she knew all the chief \nexecutives of her lifetime, especially Grover Cleveland, who served \nas secretary for the Institute for the Blind before his election.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother member of the institute, former pupil Alexander van Alstine, \nmarried Crosby in 1858. Considered one of New York's best organists, \nhe wrote the music to many of Crosby's hymns. Crosby herself put \nmusic to only a few of hers, though she played harp, piano, guitar, \nand other instruments. More often, musicians came to her for lyrics. \nFor example, one day musician William Doane dropped by her home for a \nsurprise visit, begging her to put some words to a tune he had \nrecently written and which he was to perform at an upcoming Sunday \nSchool convention. The only problem was that his train to the \nconvention was leaving in 35 minutes. He sat at the piano and played \nthe tune.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Your music says, 'Safe in the Arms of Jesus,'\" Crosby said, \nscribbling out the hymn's words immediately. \"Read it on the train \nand hurry. You don't want to be late!\" The hymn became one of \nCrosby's most famous.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough she was under contract to submit three hymns a week to her \npublisher and often wrote six or seven a day (for a dollar or two \neach), many became incredibly popular. When Dwight Moody and Ira \nSankey began to use them in their crusades, they received even more \nattention. Among them are \"Blessed Assurance,\" \"All the Way My Savior \nLeads Me,\" \"To God Be the Glory,\" \"Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior,\" \n\"Safe in the Arms of Jesus,\" \"Rescue the Perishing,\" and \"Jesus Keep \nMe Near the Cross.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe could write very complex hymns and compose music with a more \nclassical structure (she could even improvise it), but she preferred \nto write simple, sentimental verses that could be used for \nevangelism. She continued to write her poetry up to her death, a \nmonth shy of her ninety-fifth birthday. \"You will reach the river \nbrink, some sweet day, bye and bye,\" was her last stanza.\u0014",

Pamphile was to serve as a missionary in the far \ndistant Sandwich Islands, but when it came time for him to depart \nhe was too ill to go. His brother Joseph went in his place.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe arrived in Honolulu on March 19, 1864. There he was ordained in \nthe Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace on May 31 and took the name of \nDamien.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Monsignor Louis Maigret, vicar apostolic, believed that the \nlepers at the very least needed a priest to minister to their needs, \nhe realized that this assignment could potentially be a death \nsentence. After prayerful thought, Damien asked Monsignor Maigret for \npermission to go to Molokai. On 10 May 1873, Father Damien arrived at \nthe secluded settlement at Kalaupapa, where Bishop Maigret presented \nhim to the 816 lepers living there as \"one who will be a father to \nyou, and who loves you so much that he does not hesitate to become \none of you; to live and die with you.\"[\\cite this quote] Damien's \nfirst course of action was to build a church and establish the Parish \nof Saint Philomena. His role was not limited to being a priest: he \ndressed ulcers, built homes and beds, built coffins and dug \ngraves.\\[14]\u0014\n\u0014\nAs indicated in his diaries, in December 1884 Damien went about his \nevening ritual of soaking his feet in boiling water. He could not \nfeel the heat: he had contracted leprosy. Despite this discovery, \nresidents say that Damien worked vigorously to build as many homes as \nhe could and planned for the continuation of the programs he created \nafter he was gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Damien died of leprosy on April 15, 1889, aged 49. He was \noriginally buried on Molokai, but in 1936, the Belgian government \nasked for the return of his body, which was brought back on the ship \nMercator and which is now buried in Leuven, a city close to the \nvillage where he was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral memorials have been made to Damien worldwide, from Belgium \nand the United States to Ireland and Ecuador. The Father Damien \nStatue honors the priest in bronze at the United States Capitol, \nwhile a full size replica stands in front of the Hawaii State \nCapitol. In 2005, Damien was honored with the title of De Grootste \nBelg, chosen as \"The Greatest Belgian\" throughout that country's \nhistory in polling conducted by the Flemish public broadcasting \nservice\u0014",

In June 1996 he learned that Kim Phuc \nwas still alive and living in Toronto. The next month he attended a \nmilitary reunion and met someone who knew both Kim Phuc and the \nphotographer. Plummer learned that on that fateful day in 1972, Kim \nPhuc and her family were hiding in a pagoda in Trang Bang when a bomb \nhit the building. Kim Phuc and others ran into the street, where they \nwere hit by napalm being dropped from another plane. She tore off her \nburning clothing as she fled. Two of her cousins were killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe photographer and other journalists poured water from canteens on \nher burns.

What target are we aiming for? In my \nchurch and in others I have consulted, I have watched congregations \nbecome electrified as they define these traits and then begin to own \nresponsibility for imparting them. Identifying the target traits \ngives meaning, energy, and clarity of visionin short, purposeto the \nchurch's efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. What kinds of experiences do we need to have in order to become \nthose kinds of people?\u0014\n\u0014\nToo often we start with this step, without asking the first question. \nWhen we do, programming is usually a matter of what we did last year, \nwhat we did at our last church, an idea that sounds nice, what we can \nafford, or the pastor's newest whim. Planning our programming around \nthe traits God wants us to produce in believers lends purpose and \nurgency to our ministries. It also provides a bonus: we now have a \nreason to say no to things that don't fit.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. What kinds of leaders (plural) are needed to provide those kinds \nof experiences?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they answer this question, churches realize they need several \npassionate, gifted, and trained leaders to provide \"those kinds of \nexperiences.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n4. What kind of pastor is needed to train those kinds of leaders?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne church may need a coach, another may need a shepherd, and another \nmay need an executive. But by asking question three, and then \nquestion four, a church can learn to rightly divide the duties of \npastors and lay leaders. And when a resident pastor asks what kind of \npastor is needed to train his church's leaders, it invites him to \nanalyze his or her gifting, time allocation, skill development, and \ncontinuing education opportunities.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. What kinds of experiences does the pastor need to have in order to \nbe that kind of pastor?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis fifth question has helped me determine my own priorities. If \ngiven a choice between seminars on coaching or on making pastoral \ncalls, I choose the former, because that's the kind of pastor this \nchurch needs, and that's the kind of experience I need to be that \nkind of pastor.\u0014\n[FRS: I do not agree with the conclusion stated above. Pastoral calls \nare what make a leader a leader in any church. The pastor becomes \n\"believable\" this way.]\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should help our pastor determine and develop his or her own gifts.\u0014",

There are the Roman legions marching orderly into \nthe city. The Sanhedrin was called into special session to debate. \nThere were the crowds who waved palm branches before the one who rode \ninto the city on the back of a donkey. Then there was another crowd \nwho watched a different parade -- three men carrying the crossbeam of \ntheir deaths. There is a very small crowd -- the intimate gathering \nin the Upper Room.

He's come up with a lame-brained \nidea to help celebrate Easter  he's giving away stuff. Lots of stuff.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a report in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, the church \nhas gathered 15,000 gift bags, valued at $300 apiece, and they are \ngoing to give it all away, along with some cars. Yes. Used cars. \nFifteen of them, including an Audi A4, Jeep, Chevy Aveo, Mazda RX8, \nVolkswagen Jetta, two BMWs, Chevy Avalanche, Jaguar and two \nMitsubishi Eclipses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're going to give some stuff away and say, 'Imagine how great \nheaven is going to be if you feel that excited about a car,'\" Pastor \nCornelius said. \"It's completely free  all you have to do is receive \nhim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's the latest gimmick of the God Gimme Generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nCornelius says his hope is that people who don't normally come to \nchurch will come out for the Easter goods. An estimated 20,000 are \nexpected to turn out. Cornelius maintains that a slew of people don't \ncome to church because they don't feel worthy enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy commodifying Jesus, Cornelius and his followers have missed the \nwhole point of the Gospel. They are in essence teaching people that \nthe resurrection isn't reason enough to find meaning in Easter. What \nthey are doing is exploiting people and prostituting Jesus.\u0014",

    "title": "FOUR TYPES OF (NEW) CHURCHES",
    "words": "In \"Missional Renaissance,\" Reggie McNeal introduces such groups in \nthis way: \"The anticipated future has arrived in the form of \nmissional communities in every culture where the Westernized \nConstantinian order is collapsing and the organic church is taking \nroot.\" I won't try to unpack everything that McNeal is saying there, \nbut the key point is this: A more incarnational form is replacing the \ninstitutional form of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese groups go by several names. In Europe, they are called \n\"clusters\" or \"midsized groups.\" The model includes many of the \ngroups that we would call \"house churches.\" Some take the form of \n\"new monastic communities.\" Whatever they are called, they tend to \nhave four characteristics in common.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey are committed to the spiritual growth of the participants. \nThey encourage one another in spiritual formation and the practice of \nthe disciplines of the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey are engaged in ministry in the world. They may be focused on \nbeing the presence of Christ in their neighborhood, their workplaces \nor in a common ministry that all members of the group support. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey create community and practice hospitality. They are committed \nto one another but not at the expense of \"the stranger within their \ngates.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey practice accountability. They believe that genuine spiritual \ngrowth and authentic ministry only take place where there is a high \ndegree of accountability. \u0014\n\u0014\nAre these churches? Yes and no. I suppose it depends on your \ndefinition of church. They certainly are expressions of the people of \nGod on mission with God. If that is what you mean by church, yes. \nThey are not concerned about buildings, programs and building an \ninstitution. If that is what you mean by church, no.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates \nand director of the Murfreesboro Center of Central Baptist \nTheological Seminary\u0014",

    "words": "Cogito Tute\u0014\nby Dean Feldmeyer\u0014\nJohn 20:19-31\u0014\n\u0014\nThe phrase cogito tute is Latin, and it means \"think for yourself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ancients believed that a little skepticism was a good thing, a \nhealthy thing. After all, those who believe everything will fall for \nanything, right?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's that cheerful voice on the telephone, the one who always \ncalls at dinnertime and wants to offer you a deal that's just too \ngood to be true. A healthy skepticism might be in order.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's the politician who tells you everything, just everything you \nwant to hear -- the one who promises that all the problems of the \ncountry can be solved without any sacrifice or work from you. Be \nskeptical. Be very skeptical.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd even in religion -- or especially in religion -- healthy \nskepticism is often in order.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious faith is not the enemy of reason. It is often the enemy of \nblind belief and uncritical acceptance, however. A healthy, \nappropriate theology can stand the scrutiny of those who think for \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious cults are often full of people who have lost this capacity \nfor critical thinking. They give away all that they have, they \nabandon and refuse to even speak to their families. Sometimes their \ntotal devotion goes beyond that to even more extreme, even fatal, \nends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Branch Davidians were murdered by their leaders, as were the \nmembers of the People's Temple. The members of Heaven's Gate \ncommitted mass suicide, convinced that a spaceship was coming to \nrescue them from earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nA healthy skepticism is important even in religion -- maybe \nespecially in religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut where does faith fit into all of this? How do we balance a \nhealthy faith with a healthy skepticism? And what is there about an \nappropriate Christian faith that keeps our healthy skepticism from \nbecoming an unhealthy cynicism?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the apostle Thomas can help us with these questions. He was, \nafter all, the realist and the skeptic in the group.\u0014",

BLOW\u0014\n\u0014\nMister Rogers would be so disappointed in me. \u0014\n\u0014\nAside from the people who live in my building, I know the name of \nonly one person who lives on my block: Roger Cohen, a Times \ncolleague. \u0014\n\u0014\nI want to blame it on the fact that Im absolutely awful with names \nand can be quite socially awkward. But that has ever been thus. Then \nI thought that maybe it was a city thing, but that explanation goes \nbut so far. Im actually beginning to believe that its bigger than \nme, bigger than my block, bigger than this city. I increasingly \nbelieve that less neighborliness is becoming intrinsic to the modern \nAmerican experience  a most unfortunate development. \u0014\n\u0014\nA report issued Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that only \n43 percent of Americans know all or most of their neighbors by name. \nTwenty-nine percent know only some, and 28 percent know none. (Oh, my \nGod! When Roger dashes off to Paris this summer, Ill become a \nnone.) \u0014\n\u0014\nYet I have thousands of friends and followers on the \nsocial-networking sites in which I vigorously participate. (In real \nlife, I maintain a circle of friends so small that I could barely \narrange a circle.) Something is wrong with this picture. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am by no means a woe-is-us, sky-is-falling, evil-is-the-Internet \ntype. In fact, I think that a free flow of information has led to \ngreater civic engagement. Yippee! However, I am very much aware that \nsocial networks are rewiring our relationships and that our keyboard \ncommunities are affecting the attachments in our actual ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, a Pew report issued in November 2009 and entitled \nSocial Isolation and New Technology found that users of social \nnetworking services are 26 percent less likely to use their neighbors \nas a source of companionship. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd a May study by researchers at the University of Michigan found \nthat college kids today are about 40 percent lower in empathy than \ntheir counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago. The reason? One factor \ncould be social networking. As one researcher put it, The ease of \nhaving friends online might make people more likely to just tune \nout when they dont feel like responding to others problems, a \nbehavior that could carry over offline. \u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, an article in The New York Times on Thursday laid out \nnew research that revealed that feelings of hurt, jealousy and \ncompetition are widespread among children of parents who obsess over \ncellphones, instant messaging and Twitter at the expense of familial \nengagement. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no need to pine for a return to the pre-Facebook, \ncardigan-swaddled idealism of Mister Rogers and his charming \nneighbors and friends, but it is important for us to remember \nthat tangible, meaningful engagement with those around us builds \nbetter selves and stronger communities. I should post that on \nTwitter. \u0014\n\u0014",

Through inheritances, he became \nwealthy as a young man. At one time and another, his grandfather on \nhis mother's side and his own father each left him $50,000 in a day \nwhen a family could live well on $3,000 a year. His financial \ncircumstances freed him to study in Europe and later to support \nChristian publications and Christian work.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his family left him more than money. They gave him an inheritance \nof Southern views, social connections and solid achievement. His \ncultured mother was from Macon, Georgia and published a book titled \nThe Bible in Browning when J. Gresham was 22. His father was a \nsuccessful lawyer from Baltimore. Woodrow Wilson was a friend of the \nfamily.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. Gresham was reared Presbyterian. Schooled in the Westminster \nConfession and the Bible, he would later say that at twelve he had a \nbetter understanding of the Scripture than many older students \nentering seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he is known as a conservative champion of traditional \nCalvinism against modernism, under the influence of German liberals \nhe almost became a liberal himself. In the end, his conviction that \nthe Bible was true and his assurance that Christ lives today, made \nhim an ally of the fundamentalists, a group who held to certain \n\"fundamental\" truths. He was ordained in 1914, after discovering that \nChrist \"keeps a firmer hold on us than we keep on him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. Gresham's battles against modernism were mostly waged at Princeton \nSeminary. He insisted that Modernist Christianity and Bible \nChristianity were two different religions. As the Presbyterian Church \nin the U.S.A. began to adopt Modernist ideas he fought the drift. \nTypical Modernists doubted the truth of the Resurrection of Christ, \nforsook the Virgin Birth, and were skeptical of miracles and of the \nBible's accuracy. On the other side, J. Gresham defended all these \nthings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis most famous book was The Virgin Birth of Christ. In it he \nanswered objection after objection. He began by showing that the \ndoctrine was very old and that differences in Matthew and Luke could \nbe reconciled. He argued that the virgin birth was a crucial element \nof the whole story of Jesus: \"Remove the part and the whole becomes \nharder not easier to accept; the New Testament account of Jesus is \nmost convincing when it is taken as a whole.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually J. Gresham Machen felt that to be consistent, he had to \nleave Princeton. He founded Westminster Seminary to reclaim truths \nthat he saw being thrown away. Next he formed the Independent Board \nfor Presbyterian Missions because some Presbyterian missionaries \n(such as Pearl S. Buck) made statements that watered down faith in \nChrist. He was suspended from the ministry for creating this schism. \nSo he founded the Presbyterian Church of America, known today as the \nOrthodox Presbyterian Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died of overwork in 1936, preaching and traveling right up to the \nday before he died.\u0014",

    "words": "By John Springer \u0014\nTODAYshow.com contributor \u0014\nupdated 8/9/2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nThirty-four years after being told her two young children had \nperished in a car accident, Vicki Rohring learned that her children \nwere actually alive, raised all those years by her ex-husband\u0014\n\u0014\nFor 34 years, Victoria Rohring wasnt quite sure what to believe \nabout what really happened to the daughter and son she was told in a \nmysterious phone call had perished in a car crash in October 1976. \u0014\nRohrings initial instinct was that she was being lied to by the \nfamily of Jimmy Black, whom the caller claimed was critically injured \nin the same crash. Rohring had divorced Black a month earlier after a \nstormy marriage that produced two children: Scott, 5, and Karen, 7. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the years went by and private investigators hired by Rohring could \nnot find Black or the children, the heartbroken mother slowly \naccepted the fact that she might never see her kids again. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut that all changed one afternoon early this summer when the \ntelephone rang at Rohrings home in Rochester, N.Y. A woman claiming \nto be helping Scott Black find his long-lost mother said Black would \ncall Rohring that night.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpset yet intrigued, Rohring dismissed the call as a cruel prank  \nuntil she heard the voice of her son on the phone later that night.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will never lose my children again. Never. Never, Rohring, now 63, \ntold TODAYs Matt Lauer on Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe children Rohring had long feared were dead sat by their mothers \nside as she recounted their emotional reunion last month.\u0014\n\u0014\nRohring didnt recognize Scott and Karen (now Karen Cason) when she \npulled up to Scotts home in Georgia, but the tears sown from \nmother-child bonds formed more than a third of a century earlier \nblossomed freely that day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Rohring, Black and Cason told Lauer, the reunion was made possible \nwith the help of an ad on Craigslist, and because all three \nquestioned things they were told over the years about why Rohring was \nno longer part of her childrens lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some ways, it must feel like life has begun again, Lauer \nobserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it has, Scott Black agreed. You live your whole life being \ntold one thing and then you find something else, and the person who \nwas taken away from you at an early age, you finally get them back.\u0014\n\u0014\nEver-changing story \u0014\nAccording to Rohrings children, Jimmy Black gave them conflicting \naccounts about their mother as they grew up. They say that the \nstories shifted so much that over time they just didnt accept them \nany more.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy father would always tell me different stories, Karen Cason \nrecalled. My father said, I told your mom you were dead. Shes in \nthe Army. Shes in the Peace Corps. His story always changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nJimmy Black, who today rents a room in the back of Scott Blacks \nhome, told a TODAY producer by phone that his ex-wife stopped calling \nabout her children after the divorce was final. He denied having any \nknowledge about anyone calling Rohring back in October 1976 claiming \nthat her children were dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut after being separated from their mother for so long, Scott and \nKaren are less interested in the whys and wherefores than in catching \nup with lost time and looking ahead\u0014",

Two \ncenturies removed from its namesake, the Lott Carey Foreign Mission \nConvention remains true to the remarkable vision and life of Lott \nCarey (or Lott Cary, the spelling utilized by author Perry Thomas), a \nformer African-American slave who rose to become a Baptist pastor and \nthe governor of the fledgling nation of Liberia.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing extensive research on both sides of the Atlantic and \ndrawing upon available records concerning the life of Lott Cary, \nPerry offers a biographical novel that is a solid historical \nreconstruction of Carys life story, insofar as it is possible for us \nto know it in detail after the passage of two centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the pages of this volume the reader will encounter a \ncompelling recounting of a story of perseverance despite adversity, \nand vision that defied the harsh realities of a cruel world. Lott \nCary was no ordinary Baptist. Escaping from bondage through a \ncombination of circumstance, resourcefulness and hard work, Cary \nbecame a well-respected pastor and businessman in bustling Richmond, \nVirginia, in the opening years of the nineteenth century, a city that \ntoday honors the former slave with a street named after him (Cary \nStreet). Yet forsaking prosperity and acclaim, Cary chose to join \nforces with the American Colonization Society in securing an African \nhome for former African-American slaves. He spent the remainder of \nhis life struggling to establish the colony that became known as \nLiberia. Living in dire circumstances much of the time, Cary remained \ncommitted to colonization even as death frequently visited his \nfamily. As settler, pastor, self-taught doctor, community leader, \nand, finally, governor, Cary left behind a legacy that remains to \nthis day.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerrys contribution to the story of Lott Cary is that of binding \ntogether the holistic story of Carys life in a very readable, yet \nanalytical fashion. Perry reminds us that the narrative of Baptists \nincludes the lives of individuals whose influence and work was not \nconfined inside the walls of church buildings. Mission, ministry, and \ncalling led Cary to leave his stamp upon Baptists in America and \nsecure his name in African history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Slave to Governor is an inspiring read for all, and historians \nwill appreciate Perrys annotated bibliography section.\u0014",

    "title": "FIVE REASON CHURCHES BALK AT OPEN DISCUSSIONS",
    "words": "Five Reasons Churches Balk at Open Discussions \u0014\nIrcel Harrison\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is told that Brooks Hays, the legendary congressman and \nBaptist layman from Arkansas, was walking along the street with a \nfriend one day when he was accosted by a rather antagonistic woman \nwho wanted to \"straighten him out\" on an issue. Hays listened quietly \nfor a few minutes and then said to the woman, \"You may very well be \nright.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he and his friend left the woman and walked a few steps, Hays \nsaid under his breath, \"And you may very well be wrong.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI am reminded of this when I consider how difficult it is to have \ndiscussions about substantive and possibly volatile issues in a \ncongregation. I attended a workshop on \"Building Capacity for \nCongregational Dialogue,\" led by David Odom, at the Cooperative \nBaptist Fellowship General Assembly in June. Odom provided some good \nsuggestions about facilitating discussion about difficult issues in \nthe congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I think back, though, I am forced to consider why we so often balk \nat open discussion in congregational settings. Several reasons come \nto mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, open dialogue about an issue may call into question the \ncongregation's cohesiveness. Those of us in the South are \nparticularly inclined to ignore the \"elephant in the room\" and avoid \nbringing up potentially difficult subjects. When we do this, we may \nwell be sacrificing not only our honesty but our integrity. In so \ndoing, we compromise our witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, an open discussion may threaten someone's real or perceived \npower within the life of the church. Surprise! We are not always \ntalking about the pastor. The threatened person may be the matriarch \nor patriarch of the congregation, the influential community leader or \nthe biggest contributor. Whoever it may be, they like things the way \nthey are, so don't \"rock the boat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, we may be afraid to discuss some subjects because we don't \nknow what is really important. We put women wearing pants in the \nchurch on the same level as admitting people of another sexual \norientation into leadership roles. Some issues are doctrinal and some \nare simply customary, but we don't know how to differentiate between \nthe two.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, we often fail to realize that there may be more than one view \non an issue and none of them is clearly right or wrong. There is no \nreason in splitting the congregation over the unimportant. There is \nsome wisdom in being able to state our ideas and then \"agreeing to \ndisagree\" in Christian love.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, we may be afraid of being wrong and losing \"face.\" The most \ndifficult thing for any leader to do is to be willing to step up and \nsay, \"I was wrong on this. I missed it entirely.\" He or she does not \nrealize that this may be the wisest approach to building confidence \nin one's future decisions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the writer of Ephesians provides the key that will foster \nopenness, tolerance and transparency in congregational discussions: \n\"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up \ninto him who is the Head, that is, Christ\" (Ephesians 4:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat an idea!\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates \nand director of the Murfreesboro Center of Central Baptist \nTheological Seminary.

    "words": "From the Other Side of Ground Zero, Anti-Muslim Venom\u0014\n\u0014\nBy FERNANDA SANTOS\u0014\nPublished: September 5, 2010, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Internet evangelist Bill Keller moved toward the dais in tiny, \nquick steps on Sunday, exhibiting the anticipation of a man ready to \naddress a crowd. Roughly 60 people stood before him in a hotel \nmeeting room in Lower Manhattan, temporary quarters of his Christian \ncenter, his response to the mosque planned for an empty building \nnearby.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf were going to do something in New York City, were going to do \nsomething thats not just bold and visible, but something that has a \nlasting presence, said Mr. Keller, who is from the Tampa Bay area of \nFlorida. \u0014\n\u0014\nLater, he told reporters that Muslims can go to their mosque and \npreach the lies of Islam and Ill come here to preach the truth of \nthe Gospel. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince its organizers attended a community board meeting four months \nago, the mosque  part of a Muslim community center that would offer \na day care center, an auditorium and a pool  quickly became fodder \nfor a national debate. Much of the opposition is over its location: \ntwo blocks north of ground zero. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Keller promoted his center, which he called the 9/11 Christian \nCenter at Ground Zero, as a religious counterweight to the mosque, \nwhich he repeatedly called a victory mosque or a monument to a \ngreat Muslim military accomplishment, as he explained it at the \ninaugural service at the New York Marriott Downtown Hotel on West \nStreet, two blocks south of ground zero. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis career arc makes him a somewhat unusual standard-bearer: Mr. \nKeller became a preacher after serving a sentence in federal prison \nfor insider trading, as he says in a biography posted on his Web \nsite. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe has also appeared on Howard Sterns satellite radio show and once \nhad a program on national television, which was canceled after he \ncalled Islam a 1,400-year-old lie from the pits of hell. The \nprogram is now carried by a small station in Florida. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is on the Internet that Mr. Keller has assembled his largest \nfollowing. He claims that 20,000 people visit his Web site daily and \n2.5 million receive his daily sermon by e-mail. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis service at the Marriott brought together people who expressed \nadmiration, disapproval and curiosity. A man yelled, Muslims pray \nfive times a day, but Mr. Keller carried on undisturbed, denouncing \nIslam as a religion that preaches hate, violence and death. The man \neventually left. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Keller also described the conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck, \nwho is a Mormon, and Feisal Abdul Rauf, the imam who is behind the \nMuslim community center, as followers of false faiths. Later, he \ncalled the mosques potential worshipers guilty of terrorism by \nassociation, saying it was their Muslim brothers who flew \nairplanes into the World Trade Center towers and killed 3,000 people.\u0014",

    "words": "September 13, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nPenn Football Player Had Brain Disease, Autopsy Shows\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ALAN SCHWARZ\u0014\n\u0014\nALLENTOWN, Pa.  A brain autopsy of a University of Pennsylvania \nfootball player who killed himself in April has revealed the same \ntrauma-induced disease found in more than 20 deceased National \nFootball League players, raising questions of how young football \nplayers may be at risk for the disease. \u0014\n\u0014\nOwen Thomas, a popular 6-foot-2, 240-pound junior lineman for Penn \nwith no previous history of depression, hanged himself in his \noff-campus apartment after what friends and family have described as \na sudden and uncharacteristic emotional collapse. Doctors at Boston \nUniversity subsequently received permission from the family to \nexamine Thomass brain tissue and discovered early stages of chronic \ntraumatic encephalopathy, a disease linked to depression and impulse \ncontrol primarily among N.F.L. players, two of whom also committed \nsuicide in the last 10 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors in the Boston University group and outside it cautioned that \nThomass suicide should not be attributed solely or even primarily to \nthe damage in his brain, given the prevalence of suicide among \ncollege students in general. But they said that a 21-year-olds \nhaving developed the disease so early raised the possibility that it \nplayed a role in his death, and provided arresting new evidence that \nthe brain damage found in N.F.L. veterans can afflict younger \nplayers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas never had a diagnosis of a concussion on or off the football \nfield or even complained of a headache, his parents said, although \nthey acknowledged he was the kind of player who might have ignored \nthe symptoms to stay on the field. Because of this, several doctors \nsaid, his C.T.E.  whose only known cause is repetitive brain trauma \n must have developed from concussions he dismissed or from the \nthousands of subconcussive collisions he withstood in his dozen years \nof football, most of them while his brain was developing. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea that C.T.E. can stem from hits below the level of concussion \n which are endemic to football and all but impossible for doctors to \nsee or manage  is relatively new. Ever since C.T.E. in professional \nfootball players began making national headlines in early 2007, it \nhas generally been ascribed to mistreated or at least cumulative \nconcussions, for which awareness and education can be an antidote. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe diagnosis in Thomass case was independently confirmed by Dr. \nDaniel Perl, a professor of pathology at Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences, the medical school for the United \nStates military. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts not unreasonable that aspects of his behavior were related to \nthe underlying brain disease that was detected, said Dr. Perl, \nadding that he was speaking as an experienced neuropathologist and \nnot on behalf of his organization. This is real. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe added, This is a call for a broader range of research into this \nproblem that extends beyond the heavy duty N.F.L. level of \nathletics. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas is the youngest and first amateur football player to be found \nwith clear C.T.E., which is linked with cognitive impairment, \ndepression and ultimately dementia. One 18-year-old former high \nschool player who died two years ago, and whose name has been \nwithheld by the Boston University researchers at his familys \nrequest, had only incipient traces of the disease.\u0014",

McKINLEY Jr.\u0014\nPublished: September 29, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHOUSTON  Four veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan died \nthis week from what appeared to be self-inflicted gunshot wounds at \nFort Hood in central Texas, raising the toll of soldiers who died \nhere at their own hands to a record level and alarming Army \ncommanders. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo far this year, Army officials have confirmed that 14 soldiers at \nFort Hood have committed suicide. Six others are believed to have \ntaken their own lives but a final determination has yet to be made. \nThe highest number of suicides at Fort Hood occurred in 2008, when 14 \nsoldiers killed themselves, said Christopher Haug, a military \nspokesman. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 46,000 to 50,000 active officers and soldiers work at the base \nat any given time, making this years suicide rate about four times \nthe national average, which the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention estimates at 11.5 deaths per 100,000 people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe largest base in the United States, Fort Hood and the surrounding \ncommunities have suffered high rates of crime, domestic violence, \nsuicide and various mental illnesses as wave after wave of soldiers \nhave been deployed abroad over nine years of continual warfare, often \nserving more than one tour. \u0014\n\u0014\nLast November, an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal M. Hasan, was charged \nwith killing 13 people with a pistol in a rampage at a building on \nthe post.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sunday, Sgt. Michael Timothy Franklin and his wife, Jesse Ann \nFranklin, were found fatally shot in their house on the base. \u0014\n\u0014\nArmy investigators said they believed that Sergeant Franklin, who was \n31 and had served two tours in Iraq, killed his wife and then turned \nthe gun on himself. The couple had two small children. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaj. Gen. William F. Grimsley, the Fort Hood senior commander, said \nin a statement released at a news conference on Wednesday that \nleaders at all levels remain deeply concerned about this trend. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Haug said that the general did not believe that additional \nmeasures were necessary to stop the trend and that the base already \nhad an extensive suicide-prevention program. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut advocates for soldiers who have suffered mental breakdowns said \nthe programs were not effective. \u0014\n\u0014\nCynthia Thomas runs the Under the Hood Caf, an organization of \nantiwar activists and veterans who provide referrals for soldiers to \nmental health professionals. She said a stigma remained among \nsoldiers about seeking help from Army counselors for suicidal \nthoughts or other mental problems. And those soldiers who do seek \ncounseling are often given medication and put back on duty, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou dont get counseling, you get medication, Ms. Thomas said. \nThese soldiers are breaking.\u0014",

    "title": "FOR AFGHAN WIVES, A FIERY WAY OUT",
    "words": "November 7, 2010\u0014\nFor Afghan Wives, a Desperate, Fiery Way Out\u0014\nBy \\ALISSA J. RUBIN\u0014\n\u0014\nHERAT, Afghanistan  Even the poorest families in \\Afghanistan have \nmatches and cooking fuel. The combination usually sustains life. But \nit also can be the makings of a horrifying escape: from poverty, from \nforced marriages, from the abuse and despondency that can be the fate \nof Afghan women. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe night before she burned herself, Gul Zada took her children to \nher sister's for a family party. All seemed well. Later it emerged \nthat she had not brought a present, and a relative had chided her for \nit, said her son Juma Gul. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis small thing apparently broke her. Ms. Zada, who was 45, the \nmother of six children and who earned pitiably little cleaning \nhouses, ended up with burns on nearly 60 percent of her body at the \nHerat burn hospital. Survival is difficult even at 40 percent. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was burned from head to toe, her son remembers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hospital here is the only medical center in Afghanistan that \nspecifically treats victims of burning, a common form of suicide in \nthis region, partly because the tools to do it are so readily \navailable. Through early October, 75 women arrived with burns  most \nself-inflicted, others only made to look that way. That is up nearly \n30 percent from last year. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the numbers say less than the stories of the patients. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is shameful here to admit to troubles at home, and mental illness \noften goes undiagnosed or untreated. Ms. Zada, the hospital staff \nsaid, probably suffered from depression. The choices for Afghan women \nare extraordinarily restricted: Their family is their fate. There is \nlittle chance for education, little choice about whom a woman \nmarries, no choice at all about her role in her own house. Her \nprimary job is to serve her husband's family. Outside that world, she \nis an outcast. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you run away from home, you may be raped or put in jail and then \nsent home and then what will happen to you? asked Rachel Reid, a \nresearcher for \\Human Rights Watch who tracks violence against women. \u0014\n\u0014\nReturned runaways are often shot or stabbed in honor killings because \nthe families fear they have spent time unchaperoned with a man. Women \nand girls are still stoned to death. Those who burn themselves but \nsurvive are often relegated to grinding Cinderella existences while \ntheir husbands marry other, untainted women. \u0014\n\u0014\nViolence in the lives of Afghanistan's women comes from everywhere: \nfrom her father or brother, from her husband, from her father-in-law, \nfrom her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, said Dr. Shafiqa Eanin, a \nplastic surgeon at the burn hospital, which usually has at least 10 \nfemale self-immolation cases at any one time. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most sinister burn cases are actually homicides masquerading as \nsuicides, said doctors, nurses and human rights workers. \u0014\nWe have two women here right now who were burned by their \nmothers-in-law and husbands, said Dr. Arif Jalali, the hospital's \nsenior surgeon. \u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors cited two recent cases where women were beaten by their \nhusbands or in-laws, lost consciousness and awoke in the hospital to \nfind themselves burned because they had been shoved in an oven or set \non fire. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor a very few of the women who survive burnings, whether \nself-inflicted or done by relatives, the experience is a kind of \nRubicon that helps them change their lives. Some work with lawyers \nwho are recommended by the hospital and request a divorce. Most do \nnot. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefiant and Depressed \u0014\n\u0014\nEngaged at 8 and married at 12, Farzana resorted to setting herself \non fire when her father-in-law belittled her, saying she was not \nbrave enough to do so. She was 17 and had endured years of beatings \nand abuse from her husband and his family. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefiant and depressed, she went into the yard. She handed her husband \ntheir 9-month-old daughter so the baby would not see her mother \nburning. Then she poured cooking fuel on herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nI felt so sad and such pain in my heart and I felt very angry at my \nhusband and my father- and mother-in-law, and then I took the matches \nand lit myself, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nFarzana's story is about desperation and the extremes that in-laws \noften inflict on their son's wives. \\United Nations statistics \nindicate that at least 45 percent of Afghan women marry before they \nare 18; a large percentage before they are 16. Many girls are still \ngiven as payment for debts, which sentences them to a life of \nservitude and, almost always, abuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nA bright child whose favorite subjects were Dari language and poetry, \nFarzana dreamed of becoming a teacher. But she had been promised in \nmarriage to the son of the family that was providing a wife for her \nbrother, and when she turned 12, her in-laws insisted it was time to \nmarry. Her future husband had just turned 14. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the marriage day, he beat me when I woke up and shouted at me, \nshe said. He was always favoring his mother and using bad words \nabout me. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe beatings went on for four years. Then Farzana's brother took a \nsecond wife, an insult to Farzana's in-laws. Her mistreatment \nworsened. They refused to allow her to see her mother, and her \nhusband beat her more often. \u0014\n\u0014\nI thought of running away from that house, but then I thought: what \nwill happen to the name of my family? she said. No one in our \nfamily has asked for divorce. So how can I be the first? \u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors and nurses say that especially in cases involving younger \nwomen, fury at their situation, a sense of being trapped and a desire \nto shame their husbands into caring for them all come together. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was true of Farzana. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe thing that forced me to set myself on fire was when my \nfather-in-law said: 'You are not able to set yourself on fire,' she \nrecalled. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut she did, and when the flames were out, 58 percent of her body was \nburnt. As a relative bundled her raw body into a car for the \nhospital, her husband whispered: If anybody asks you, don't tell \nthem my name; don't say I had anything to do with it.'\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter 57 days in the hospital and multiple skin grafts, she is home \nwith her mother and torn between family traditions and an inchoate \nsense that a new way of thinking is needed. \u0014\n\u0014\nFarzana's daughter is being brought up by her husband's family, and \nmother and daughter are not allowed to see each other. Despite that, \nshe says that she cannot go back to her husband's house. \u0014\n\u0014\nFive years I spent in his house with those people, she said. My \nmarriage was for other people. They should never have given me in a \nchild marriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Common Option \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do women burn themselves rather than choose another form of \nsuicide? \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is one reason, said Dr. Jalali. Many women mistakenly think \ndeath will be instant. Halima, 20, a patient in the hospital in \nAugust, said she considered jumping from a roof but worried she would \nonly break her leg. If she set herself on fire, she said, It would \nall be over. \u0014\n\u0014\nSelf-immolation is more common in Herat and western Afghanistan than \nother parts of the country. The area's closeness to Iran may partly \nexplain why; Iran shares in the culture of suicide by burning. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike many women admitted to the burn hospital, Ms. Zada showed no \noutward signs of distress before she set herself on fire. Her life, \nthough, was hard. Her husband is a sharecropper. She cleaned houses \nand at night stayed up to clean her own home  a nearly impossible \ntask in the family's squalid earthen and brick two-room house \nbuffeted by the Herati winds that sweep in a layer of dust each time \nthe door opens. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo her family, she was a constant provider. Before I thought of \nwanting something, she provided me with it, said Juma Gul, 32, her \neldest son, a laborer who earns about $140 a month. She would \nembroider our clothes so that we wouldn't feel we had less than other \npeople. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs he spoke, his 10-year-old twin sisters sat near him holding hands \nand a picture of their mother. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hospital, Ms. Zada rallied at first, and Juma Gul was \nencouraged, unaware of how hard it is to survive such extensive \nburns. That is especially true in the developing world, said Dr. \nRobert Sheridan, chief of surgery at the \\Shriners Burn Hospital in \nBoston and a trauma surgeon at \\Massachusetts General Hospital. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe greatest risk is sepsis, a deadly infection that generally starts \nin the second week after a burn and is hard to stop, Dr. Sheridan \nsaid. Even badly burned and infected patients can speak almost up to \nthe hour of their death, often giving families false hopes. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was getting better, her son insisted. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut infection had, in fact, set in, and the family did not have the \nmoney for powerful antibiotics that could give her whatever small \nchance there was to survive. Juma Gul eventually managed to beg and \nborrow the money, but not before the infection spread. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks after his mother set herself on fire, he stood by her bed \nas she stopped breathing.\u0014",

    "title": "FOUR VIEWS OF AMERICANS ABOUT GOD",
    "words": "More than a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche, the depressive and \ndepressing German philosopher, pronounced the death of God, but most \nAmericans have yet to hear the message. The four horsemen of the New \nAtheist apocalypseChristopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, \nand Daniel C. Dennetthave done their best to carry on the movement \nthat Nietzsche heralded, but their achievement has been largely \nmonetary. Some 90 percent of Americans are still content to believe \nin God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American religious landscape is admittedly as varied and complex \nas the geographical landscape. This makes any taxonomy of religious \nbeliefs necessarily artificial, as the authors note. So they start \nwith what American religious believers have in common: namely, the \nnotion that God is loving. This is something some 85 percent of \nAmericans affirm.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeneath that superficial similarity, though, is a range of \nconceptions about God's character. Those conceptions dramatically \nalter our understanding of the shape his love takes in our world. \nFroese and Bader examine two questions whose answers, they contend, \ndetermine more about a person's cultural and political worldview than \nany other sociological factor. First, to what extent does God \ninteract with the world? Second, to what extent does God judge the \nworld? As the authors put it, \"The answers to these questions predict \nthe substance of our worldviews much better than the color of our \nskin, the size of our bank account, the political party we belong to, \nor whether we wear a white Stetson or faded Birkenstocks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRespondents' answers lead the authors to identify four conceptions of \nGod among the American religious public: (1) the authoritative God, \nwho both judges and is closely engaged in the world; (2) the \nbenevolent God, who is \"engaged but nonjudgmental\"; (3) the critical \nGod, who happens to be judgmental but disengaged; and (4) the distant \nGod, who is neither engaged nor judgmental, and could care less about \nhow humans muck about.\u0014",

It is this judgment that makes the leap of faith both\u0014\npossible and obligatory as a human and intelligent action.

    "words": "Framed for Murder?\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\nPublished: December 8, 2010\u0014\nCalifornia may be about to execute an innocent man. \u0014\nThe New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThats the view of five federal judges in a case involving Kevin \nCooper, a black man in California who faces lethal injection next \nyear for supposedly murdering a white family. The judges argue \ncompellingly that he was framed by police. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Coopers impending execution is so outrageous that it has \nproduced a mutiny among these federal circuit court judges, \ndistinguished jurists just one notch below the United States Supreme \nCourt. But the judicial process has run out for Mr. Cooper. Now its \nup to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to decide whether to commute Mr. \nCoopers sentence before leaving office. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis case, an illuminating window into the pitfalls of capital \npunishment, dates to a horrific quadruple-murder in June 1983. Doug \nand Peggy Ryen were stabbed to death in their house, along with their \n10-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old houseguest. The Ryens \n8-year-old son, Josh, was left for dead but survived. They were all \nwhite. \u0014\n\u0014\nJosh initially told investigators that the crime had been committed \nby three people, all white, although by the trial he suggested that \nhe had seen just one person with an Afro. The first version made \nsense because the weapons included a hatchet, an ice pick and one or \ntwo knives. Could one intruder juggling several weapons overpower \nfive victims, including a 200-pound former Marine like Doug Ryen, who \nalso had a loaded rifle nearby? \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the police learned that Mr. Cooper had walked away from the \nminimum security prison where he was serving a burglary sentence and \nhad hidden in an empty home 125 yards away from the crime scene. The \npolice decided that he had committed the crime alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam A. Fletcher, a federal circuit judge, explained his view of \nwhat happens in such cases in a law school lecture at Gonzaga \nUniversity, in which he added that Mr. Cooper is probably innocent: \nThe police are under heavy pressure to solve a high-profile crime. \nThey know, or think they know, who did the crime. And they plant \nevidence to help their case along. \u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Fletcher wrote an extraordinary judicial opinion  more than \n100 pages when it was released  dissenting from the refusal of the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to rehear the \ncase. The opinion is a 21st-century version of mile Zolas famous \nJAccuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Fletcher, a well-respected judge and former law professor, was \njoined in his JAccuse by four other circuit judges. Six more wrote \ntheir own dissents calling for the full Ninth Circuit to rehear the \ncase. But they fell just short of the votes needed for rehearing. \u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Fletcher laid out countless anomalies in the case. Mr. Coopers \nblood showed up on a beige T-shirt apparently left by a murderer near \nthe scene, but that blood turned out to have a preservative in it  \nthe kind of preservative used by police when they keep blood in test \ntubes. \u0014\nThen a forensic scientist found that a sample from the test tube of \nMr. Coopers blood held by police actually contained blood from more \nthan one person. That leads Mr. Coopers defense team and Judge \nFletcher to believe that someone removed blood and then filled the \ntube back to the top with someone elses blood\u0014",

On May 27, 1943, \nZamperini's bomber left Oahu in search of survivors from a downed \nplane. About 800 miles from the base one of the engines cut out and \nthe bomber plunged into the ocean. Zamperini and another soldier \nwould stay afloat on a tiny life raft for 47 daysa world record for \nsurvival at sea. After confronting sharks, starvation, and dementia, \ntheir real battle would begin. Zamperini spent the next two years as \na Japanese POW in the notorious Sugamo Prison. In particular, a guard \nnamed Watanabe (nicknamed \"the Bird\") ensured that Louis endured \nconstant physical torture and verbal humiliationall in an attempt to \nshatter the spirit of the American soldiers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1944, after Louis had been declared dead, he returned to America \nto a rush of publicity. Unfortunately, his life quickly descended \ninto a new self-made prison of alcoholism and bitterness. In \nparticular, Louis now endured constant nightmares about his past and \nan obsessive drive to murder \"the Bird.\" But the walls of addiction \nand hatred started to crumble in 1949 when Louis attended a Billy \nGraham crusade and heard the gospel and trusted Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter receiving Christ, in the words of Laura Hildenbrand:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen [Louie] thought of his history, what resonated with him now was \nnot all that he had suffered but the divine love that he believed had \nintervened to save him. He was not the worthless, broken, forsaken \nman that the Bird had striven to make him. In a single, silent \nmoment, his rage, his fear, his humiliation and helplessness, had \nfallen away. That morning, he believed, he was a new creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year after trusting Christ, Zamperini returned to the Sugamo Prison \nin Japan where he met with his former captors, except the Bird. When \nLouis was told that the Bird had committed suicide, in Hildebrand's \nwords,\u0014\n\u0014\n[Louie] felt something he had never felt for his captor before.

    "title": "FASTING AND REPENTNANCE FOR SALEM WITCH TRIALS",
    "words": "January 15, 1697 \u0014\nFasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay \nColony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the \ntragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons \nfor the day of fasting given by the resolution were, \"so all of God's \npeople may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity \nmay be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this \nland; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we \nhave done amiss, to do so no more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of \njustice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's \nPuritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen \nwere hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused \nwere women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's \ntownspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the \nproceedings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were \nbewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had \nseen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, \nscapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no \nevidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was \npresented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two \nwitnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. \nIt was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the \naccused.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers \nrather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out \nstrongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the \nBiblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige \nof Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the \nwhole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts \nlegislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held \non January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could \noffer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them \nfrom repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the \nland. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the \ntrials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and \nguidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided \nover many of the capital judgments, published a written confession \nacknowledging his own \"blame and shame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSalem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the \ntrials. In 1710, the Massachusetts legislature reversed some of the \nconvictions, and in the following years authorities gave compensation \nto the families of the accused witches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nKennedy, James with Newcombe, Jerry.

    "title": "FOR SOME LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION AND ENDS AT BIRTH",
    "words": "While the following is not the whole story, it does summarize the \nconcern of some for not enough emphasis being put on saving mothers' \nlives in childbirth and in other ways. An example of this attitude is \nseen below after the following comments.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most frequently repeated canards of the abortion debate is \nthat pro-lifers really don't care about life. As much as they talk \nabout protecting the unborn, we are told, pro-lifers do nothing to \nsupport mothers and infants who are already in the world. Liberal \nwriters such as Matthew Yglesias are given to observing that \npro-lifers believe that \"life begins at conception and ends at \nbirth.\" At Commonweal, David Gibson, a journalist who frequently \ncovers the abortion debate, asks how much pro-lifers do for mothers: \n\"I just want to know what realistic steps they are proposing or \nbacking. I'm not sure I'd expect to hear anything from pro-life \ngroups now since there's really been nothing for years.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n From Christianity Today  1/21/11\u0014\n\u0014\n12/23/10 NYTimes\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix announced on \nTuesday that it will continue to provide life-saving abortion care to \npatients even though it means losing its affiliation with the local \nRoman Catholic Diocese. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis commendable decision by St. Joseph's and the hospital network \nthat oversees it, Catholic Healthcare West, upholds important legal \nand moral principles. It also underscores the need to ensure that \nreligiously affiliated hospitals comply with their legal duty to \nprovide emergency reproductive care. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe decision follows a standoff between the hospital and the leader \nof the Phoenix diocese, Bishop Thomas Olmsted. In November 2009, a \n27-year-old mother of four in her third month of pregnancy arrived at \nSt. Joseph's. She was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, a \nserious complication that might well have killed her if she had \ncontinued the pregnancy. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hospital performed an abortion, leading Bishop Olmsted to declare \nSister Margaret McBride, a member of the hospital's ethics committee, \nautomatically excommunicated because she had consented to the \ntherapeutic abortion necessary to save the woman's life. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust last month, Bishop Olmsted threatened to remove his endorsement \nof the hospital unless he received a written acknowledgement that the \nabortion violated Catholic policy and will never occur again at St. \nJoseph's Hospital.  The hospital refused to bow to these demands, \nsumming up its position with elegant simplicity: Morally, ethically, \nand legally we simply cannot stand by and let someone die whose life \nwe might be able to save.\u0014",

    "words": "Frederick Douglass \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn into slavery, Frederick Douglass lived to become one of the most \ninfluential figures in African American history. As a young man and a \nslave in Maryland, Frederick Douglass was recognized as a bright \nyoung man by both blacks and whites. During his life as a slave in \nBaltimore he learned to read and write and passed his knowledge along \nto other blacks in Baltimore. Douglass is remembered as a great \nspeaker. His speaking abilities were developed in the secret debating \nclub called the East Baltimore Mental Improvement Society. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe escaped from slavery to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1838. There \nhe discovered the newspaper of the leading white abolitionist William \nLloyd Garrison, The Liberator. Douglass and Garrison soon impressed \none another and would work together for social reform and the \nabolition of slavery. Because of his speaking ability, Douglass soon \nbecame the major drawing card at meetings of the abolitionist \nsociety. A deep melodious voice, grace and a flair for the dramatic \nwould allow Douglass to mesmerize his listeners at the abolitionist \nmeetings. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1845 to 1847, Douglas would travel in Great Britain speaking for \nthe elimination of slavery. While in Britain he expanded his view of \nthe struggle for human rights. He spoke in favor of Irish home rule \nand eventually would speak on behalf of the landless European \npeasantry, women's suffrage, prison reform, free public school \neducation and universal peace. In 1846 he wrote to Garrison, \"I \ncannot allow myself to be insensitive to the wrongs and sufferings of \nany part of the great family of man[sic].\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDouglass would eventually split with Garrison and the largely white \nabolitionist movement to work more closely with the Black leaders of \nthe time. Many of the leading black figures of the time were critical \nof Douglass. They did not believe that justice could ever be achieved \nfor Blacks in this country while Douglass maintained an optimistic \nvision for America. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War Frederick Douglass worked as an enlistment \nofficer and encouraged President Lincoln to make Emancipation an \nissue in the Civil War. Following the war Douglass would work for the \nFreedman's Bureau, the Freedman Bank and hold various government \nappointments including minister to Haiti and US marshal for the \nDistrict of Columbia. \u0014\n\u0014\nDouglass writes, \"The real question, the all commanding question, is \nwhether American justice, American liberty, American civilization, \nAmerican law and American Christianity can be made to include and \nprotect alike and forever all American citizens. . .\"\u0014",

The earthquake had an estimated surface wave magnitude \n(Ms) of 8.19. Immediately after the shock, numerous fires broke out \nin Tokyo and Yokohama.

I wasn't going to make it through this prayer \nmeeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer after lengthy prayer covered everything mentioned during \nrequest time. I only had passionate interest in two or three of the \nissues being prayed about. On my knees, with my head in my arms, I \nwas fighting sleep.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas I a sluggard? A weak Christian, bored with the goings-on?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. I had run smack dab into the middle of a prayer meeting filled \nwith \"list pray-ers\" and people with the gift of mercy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many of us, growth in our prayer lives comes slowly because we \nnever learn a basic truth about prayer: There is no \"one size fits \nall.\" Just as our individual personalities and spiritual gifts \ndiffer, so do our prayer styles.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people are very emotional when they pray. They seem to pour \ntheir hearts into the issue at hand. They pray passionately, often \nwith tears or with great drama. Others need a list so they can make \nsure they cover everything. When they pray in a group, if someone's \nrequest was missed, they'll jump back in and remember it. Still \nothers pray militantly, seeming to rebuke Satan and demons almost as \nmuch as they address God.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome believers pray almost exclusively using Scripture. Others carry \non a two-way conversation, saying something, then waiting for an \nanswer from God, then talking and listening some more. Some can only \npray short thoughts; others pray for minuteseven hourson end. Some \nbelievers pray using a spiritual language or \"tongues.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDifferent cultures pray in different ways. Many African-American and \nKorean believers, when in a group prayer meeting, all pray aloud at \nonce. One time when I was praying in a group that included a Hispanic \nbrother, Ephraim, I experienced a style I had never heard before. \nEphraim's prayer became a combination of spoken words and sentences, \ngrunts and groans, and even sung phrases. It was one of the most \nbeautiful styles I had ever heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs one of these styles the correct one? Do we know we've arrived when \nwe can pray a certain way? No! As you grow in prayer, you need to \nfind your own prayer style and then primarily develop that avenue of \npraying. Does that mean you should never pray another way or that you \nshould refuse to pray with people who pray in another style? \nCertainly not. Learning to appreciate prayer diversity is beneficial \nto us individually and to the unity of the church. We all need to \nfight being in a box or a rut in regard to prayer. But this doesn't \nmean we ignore our basic dispositions.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how do we find our style?\u0014\nFor full article: Word\\My Documents\\Finding Your Prayer Personality\u0014",

    "words": "March 30, 1799 \u0014\n\u0014\nFriedrich Tholuck\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nFriedrich August Gottreu Tholuck entered the world on this day, March \n30, 1799 in Breslau, Prussia (later in Poland). His father was a \ngoldsmith and the family expected the son to become a craftsman, too, \nbut Friedrich was so awkward that prudence suggested he find work in \nsome other field.\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly he was meant for the life of a scholar, for by the time he \nwas sixteen years old, he was well on his way to mastering nineteen \nlanguages. As an adult, he spoke English, Greek, Arabic, Italian and \nFrench almost as well as his native German.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the boy was a skeptic. He claimed to find Islam more attractive \nthan Christianity. However, personal encounters with the vibrant \nChristianity of Schleiermacher, Neander and a Moravian baron led him \nto become an evangelical Christian. His took evangelist Count von \nZinzendorf's motto as his own: \"I have but one passion and that is He \n[Jesus] and He alone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAppointed to teach at Halle, he faced opposition from fellow faculty \nmembers who were rationalists. But it was Friedrich's warm Christian \nspirit that prevailed over their coldly analytical thought: the \nentire faculty became evangelical.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that time, skepticism and rationalism prevailed in German \nuniversities. Leading German theologians and thinkers ripped apart \nthe Scriptures using higher criticism. Friedrich did not escape this \ninfluence, but it did not lead him into the heresies of most \ntheologians. This was because he genuinely loved Christ Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriedrich's love of Christ inspired him to make it his main aim to \nlead his students to personal faith in the Savior. His way of \npressing home truth can be seen in his comment on Christ's prayer on \nthe cross, \"Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" \nFriedrich exclaimed, \"How do these words on the Cross call to us, in \nGod's name, not to make light of sin!\" He invited his students for \nmeals and took long walks with them. Several became notable \ntheologians in their own right; men such as the teacher-theologian \nCharles Hodge remembered him with respect.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriedrich wrote a number of books. The best-known may have been his \ncommentary on the Gospel of John. Church historian Schaff says \"his \nlearning was extensive rather than thorough or exhaustive.\" He was \n\"original, brilliant, suggestive, eloquent and full of poetry, wit \nand humor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nSchaff, D.

    "words": "Four Traps That Await Clergy When They Move \u0014\nBill Wilson\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, May 19, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nA minister recently asked me what I thought were the major traps that \nmost often snared ministers when they moved to a new congregation. \u0014\nGreat question! healthy churches and ministers pay attention to \npotential trouble spots and act in a proactive way to avoid getting \nderailed early in the new relationship, Wilson writes. \u0014\n\u0014\nA minister recently asked me what I thought were the major traps that \nmost often snared ministers when they moved to a new congregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nGreat question! Healthy churches and ministers pay attention to \npotential trouble spots and act in a proactive way to avoid getting \nderailed early in the new relationship. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral traps come to mind:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trap of expectations. \u0014\n\u0014\nComing into a congregation as the new minister is a wonderful season \nof new beginnings and possibilities. People await you with great \nexpectations. \u0014\n\u0014\nOften those expectations are exaggerated and grandiose. You are seen \nas the one who will reverse decades of decline, inspire apathetic \ncongregants, make everyone happy at all times and never disappoint. \u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the grandiosity is in the mind of the minister. She or he \nthinks this church is everything their last church was not. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe grass looks so green on this side of the fence! Your own foibles \nand bad habits are overlooked in your infatuation with your new \nopportunity. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnrealistic expectations, wherever they originate, are a set-up. They \nlead us away from God's design for us and his church and trap us in \nimpossible situations. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou will never succeed as the Messiah, and the congregation will soon \nexpose its cracks and fissures and remind you that this really isn't \nheaven on earth. \u0014\n\u0014\nTalking about this and anticipating the inevitable disappointments \nare an essential component of a healthy relationship between minister \nand congregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe humility that comes when we acknowledge that we are all earthen \nvessels and deeply flawed is a great place to begin a relationship \nbetween minister and congregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trap of agendas.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour arrival invites the congregation to imagine new possibilities. \nThat is a wonderful and divine part of the opportunity. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it is helpful to remember that all of us have agendas. Some \nare overt, some quite covert. Simply put, some will see your coming \nas an opportunity to advance a cause or seek a role that has been \nthwarted previously. \u0014\n\u0014\nYour arrival is a new day that will bring frustrated congregants out \nof the woodwork. Others will assume they will have the same intimacy \nor insider status that they had with the previous person in your \nposition. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome will have been deeply disappointed by your predecessor and will \ngreet you with frosty indifference. \u0014\n\u0014\nYour job is to be aware. Avoid the trap of believing everything you \nhear. From search committee members to the most detached congregants, \npersonal agendas abound. \u0014\n\u0014\nWatch with a degree of prayerful detachment those around you. Get up \non a mental balcony in every meeting and during every conversation \nand ask yourself what is really going on. Constantly ask yourself: \nWhy this? Why now? \u0014\n\u0014\nYour coming evokes a wide range of personal responses that you will \nbe wise to take notice of in those early encounters. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trap of talking. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince clergy are seemingly paid to speak, the usual pattern is that \nwe do  profusely, often and repeatedly. Watch out for the trap of \nverbosity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe entry into a new congregation calls for a season of diagnostic \nrather than prescriptive conversations. If your medical doctor walked \ninto the exam room and immediately began a monologue about their \nideas for your health, without ever asking for input from you, I hope \nyou would jump up and leave the room.\u0014\n \u0014\nI'd offer the same counsel to a congregation and its minister. Your \nrole in the early days of your ministry is to have your ears wide \nopen, your eyes wide open and your heart wide open. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere will be a time to speak the truth you bring to the situation, \nbut initially your talking should consist of words of invitation to \nothers. Ask many, many questions, especially around the themes of \nheritage and hopes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trap of silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be blunt, after 100 days on the job, you had better have something \nto say. There are those who counsel a full year of observation before \nmaking any move toward acts of active leadership. The pace of our \nculture dictates a new reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour learning curve has been shortened, and you must understand the \ntrap that your silence as a leader, should it go too long, will be \nmisinterpreted as your lack of ability to lead. \u0014\n\u0014\nYour first 100 days offer you a never-to-be-repeated opportunity to \ndefine yourself and establish some trajectories for your ministry. \nPay attention to this time with careful and prayerful thought. \u0014\nI have seen some authors encourage breaking down your first 100 days \ninto ten 10-day blocks of time and becoming exceptionally deliberate \nabout the proactive use of those days. These are days to emphasize \nrelationships over tasks, so plan your time accordingly. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter 100 days, emerge from your time of study and observation with \nclear and compelling observations. The people need to hear from you. \nThe rest of your first year will be a time to begin an extended \ncongregational conversation that will shape the church's agenda for \nthe near future. \u0014\nUse those days to engage people around \"what if\" questions. Invite \nthem to dream with you and God about possibilities. \u0014\n\u0014\nTell them what matters to you and what you love about them. Share \nwith them a generous vision of the future and invite them to join you \nin creating that vision and making it a reality. Speak up!\u0014\nBeware the traps and enjoy the ride. It really is a marvelous \nopportunity to start anew.\u0014\n \u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

    "words": "May 6, 1867 \u0014\n\u0014\nFamed Southern Baptist, George W. Truett\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge W. Truett was born on this day, May 6, 1867 on a farm in the \nmountains of North Carolina. He became one of the most popular boys \nin the county, equally handy on the farm, at his desk or sighting \ndown a rifle barrel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral times as a child and then as a young man, George recognized \nhis need for a savior from his sins. But he was nineteen before he \nwent forward, \"confessing Christ before all the people.\" That very \nnight he began to urge his classmates to turn to Christ. Many did. He \nwas baptized, joined the Baptist church and began to teach Sunday \nschool. Not only that, but, to pay his way through college, the young \nman opened a school, which soon enrolled 300 students and employed \nthree teachers! He preached. Those who heard him speak called him a \nsecond Spurgeon. He was offered a church, but turned it down. He had \ndecided to move with his parents to Texas. And Texas is where he made \nhis mark for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe local Baptist church at Whitewright Texas decided to ordain him. \nGeorge protested, but \"there I was against a whole church...\" He was \nordained, but as of yet held no church. Instead, the 23-year-old \naccepted the position as chief financial officer of Baylor University \nbecause, \"people do what he asks them to do.\" The school was deeply \nin debt by the standards of the day. In 23 months, George eliminated \nthe debt completely. Later he was offered the school's presidency, \nbut he turned it down, preferring to pastor a church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 30, George became pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, \nTexas. He had wanted to turn it down, but felt God was saying, \"take \nit.\" During his 47 years of leadership, the church grew from 715 \nmembers to over 7,000. Even after it was remodeled, a thousand people \nmight be turned away from the doors on a given Sunday. It was the \nlargest membership in the Southern Baptist denomination, the largest \nmembership in the world (at that time) and highly influential. Other \nthan his excellent speaking, another source of growth was his \ntraining program for Sunday school teachers.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople hung on George's words. In one sermon, he said \"Our cities \nsaved means the salvation of civilization. Our cities lost means the \ncorruption and destruction of civilization.\" He then went on to show \nthat the family is the key to the city. \"As goes the home, so will go \nthe city. And I pause to say that the home is in peril and endangered \nnow as it has not been in modern times. ...If people trifle with the \nhome they are undermining the foundation of an enduring and worthy \ncivilization...Put crepe on the door of your heart if things are \nwrong in the family. Put crepe on the door.\" He always preached for a \ndecision.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge almost left the pulpit once, however. He accidentally shot and \nkilled one of his closest friends, the chief of police, in a hunting \naccident. Praying and crying, he could not bring himself to preach \nagain, until in a vision he saw Christ saying \"You are my man from \nnow on.\" The night that he returned to the pulpit, other churches \nclosed their doors so that their members could go hear him preach.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn his seventieth birthday he wrote his wife a letter in which he \nsaid, \"I would this day rededicate my all to Christ...\" Although \ngreatly honored in his life, none of it went to his head. He died in \n1944 after a painful illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nResources\u0014\n\u0014\nEzell, John S. \"Truett, George Washington.\" Dictionary of American \nBiography.\u0014\nPerez, Joan Jenkins. \"Truett, George Washington.\" \nhttp://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/ \narticles/view/TT/ftr16.html.\u0014\nReese, Ed.

FRS  6/20/11\u0014\n\u0014\nFLOWERS OF WINTER\u0014\n\u0014\nSpring and summer are times of planting and of growth. Autumn is a \ntime of harvest. Winter is the fulfillment of all the seasons past, a \ntime to pull all the scattered pieces of seasons past into a final \nwholeness. In winter we still plant and cultivate and harvest, but in \nnew ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you live in a place of winter, where you dare not plant anything \noutside until after Memorial Day, or your new plants will be only \nmemorials themselves after the freeze that haunts spring like a \nzombie craving the brains of vegetarians, you push the season forward \nany way you can, so a place of winter is in spring and early summer a \nplace of hanging baskets, that can be brought inside when a night is \ntoo cold.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe freezes are not the only pillagers of springtime. There are \nfour-legged predators, too, that want to eat the fruits of your work. \nRabbits and deer will munch anything you plant, no matter how much \nyou paid for it or how hard you worked on it. So a place of winter in \nsummer is a place of flower boxes, high on railings on porches and \ndecks, too high for rabbits, and where deer will not venture.\u0014\n\u0014\nGardeners in their winter years complain about the work but cannot \ngive it up. They get down onto their knees and cannot get back up. \nThat's okay. If you have to stay on your knees, you can feel a lot of \nhumility and do a lot of praying. But baskets and boxes give you room \nto plant and dig even if your knees won't bend.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a growing season, even in winter, but it is for flower boxes \nand hanging baskets. There are predators in winter, freezes and deer \nand rabbits, that will devour your blooms if you put them out too \nfar. Winter is a time to keep your flowers close at hand, even though \nthey be few, the better to touch and sniff and look . \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI like those words: \"There is a growing season, even in winter.\"  \nYou're never too old to grow.

Schooled in the Westminster \nConfession and the Bible, he would later say that at twelve he had a \nbetter understanding of the Scripture than many older students \nentering seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he is known as a conservative champion of traditional \nCalvinism against modernism, under the influence of German liberals \nhe almost became a liberal himself. In the end, his conviction that \nthe Bible was true and his assurance that Christ lives today, made \nhim an ally of the fundamentalists, a group who held to certain \n\"fundamental\" truths. He was ordained in 1914, after discovering that \nChrist \"keeps a firmer hold on us than we keep on him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. Gresham's battles against modernism were mostly waged at Princeton \nSeminary. He insisted that Modernist Christianity and Bible \nChristianity were two different religions. As the Presbyterian Church \nin the U.S.A. began to adopt Modernist ideas he fought the drift. \nTypical Modernists doubted the truth of the Resurrection of Christ, \nforsook the Virgin Birth, and were skeptical of miracles and of the \nBible's accuracy. On the other side, J. Gresham defended all these \nthings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis most famous book was The Virgin Birth of Christ. In it he \nanswered objection after objection. He began by showing that the \ndoctrine was very old and that differences in Matthew and Luke could \nbe reconciled. He argued that the virgin birth was a crucial element \nof the whole story of Jesus: \"Remove the part and the whole becomes \nharder not easier to accept; the New Testament account of Jesus is \nmost convincing when it is taken as a whole.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually J. Gresham Machen felt that to be consistent, he had to \nleave Princeton. He founded Westminster Seminary to reclaim truths \nthat he saw being thrown away. Next he formed the Independent Board \nfor Presbyterian Missions because some Presbyterian missionaries \n(such as Pearl S. Buck) made statements that watered down faith in \nChrist. He was suspended from the ministry for creating this schism. \nSo he founded the Presbyterian Church of America, known today as the \nOrthodox Presbyterian Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died of overwork in 1936, preaching and traveling right up to the \nday before he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMachen, J.

(RNS) State officials will retain legal custody of \na 19-month-old girl whose devoutly religious parents treated the \ngirls vision-threatening medical condition with prayer instead of \ntaking her to a doctor. \u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy and Rebecca Wyland were convicted in June of first-degree \ncriminal mistreatment and sentenced to 90 days in jail and three \nyears probation for failing to seek treatment for their daughter, \nAlayna.\u0014\n\u0014\nCircuit Judge Douglas Van Dyk said he was concerned the Wylands would \nnot continue necessary long-term medical treatment once off \nprobation. He denied a motion to return custody of the girl to the \nWylands, and will review the matter in July 2012.\u0014\n\u0014\nVan Dyk cited statements that Timothy Wyland recently made to a child \nwelfare worker who asked whether the couple would follow through with \nthe court-mandated treatment plan without state supervision.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly time will tell, Wyland reportedly replied, adding that God is \nthe best healer and decides who will be cured.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after her birth in late 2009, Alaynas left eye quickly was \nengulfed by an abnormal mass of blood vessels. The Wylands, members \nof the Followers of Christ, an Oregon City faith-healing church, used \nspiritual rituals to treat the eye because medical care conflicts \nwith their religious beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoctors say the girl will need treatment for the damaged eye until \nshe turns 7. Although she lives at home, the Department of Human \nServices has had legal custody since last July and supervises her \ncare.\u0014",

    "title": "FIVE MAJOR TRENDS FOR CHURCHES IN AMERICA",
    "words": "From My Perspective: Five major trends for churches in America\u0014\nby Thom Rainer on Monday, June 20, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.,  Discerning future trends can be difficult if not \nrisky. If we miss a trend, we risk missing opportunities because we \nhad our resources directed elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am thus careful when I do trend projections. I am especially \ncareful when I am projecting trends that will have a direct impact on \nthe churches in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe basis for the trends\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trends that follow were not created in a vacuum. Most of the \ninformation is based on studies we have done at LifeWay Research. But \nmuch of this research provides us information and facts about today's \nrealities. It does not offer certitude for future trends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe process is analogous to weather forecasting. We can see all the \ningredients that will likely cause a specific outcome. But those \nfactors can change, so we can never say that we are 100 percent \ncertain.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive major trends\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause most of the research that is the basis for these trends was \nrelated to American demographics, we must not extend the projections \nbeyond our nation's borders. Nevertheless, it is possible that some \nof the research could have implications beyond American churches.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Our nation will see the emergence of the largest generational \nmission field in more than a century. According to our current \nresearch, the Millennial generation, those born between 1980 and \n2000, will have a very low Christian representation. Our estimates \nnow are that only 15 percent are Christian. With a huge population of \nnearly 80 million, that means that nearly 70 million young people are \nnot Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. The dominant attitude of this huge generation toward Christianity \nwill be largely indifferent. Only 13 percent of the Millennials rank \nany type of spiritual matter as important to their lives. They are \nnot angry at churches and Christians. They simply ignore us because \nthey do not deem us as meaningful or relevant.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Senior adult ministries in churches will experience steep \ndeclines. As the large Baby Boomer generation moves into their older \nyears, they will resist any suggestion that they are senior adults, \nno matter how senior they may be. Unfortunately, many churches are \nslow to adapt to new realities. If they do senior adult ministry the \nway they've always done it, it will be headed for failure.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. The large Boomer generation will become more receptive to the \ngospel. Our data is anecdotal for now, but we are seeing indications \nthat the Boomers may actually become more interested in spiritual \nmatters in general and Christianity specifically. If so, this trend \nwill be counter to other trends where adults tend to become less \nreceptive to the gospel as they age. The Baby Boomers have tried it \nall and found no joy. They may likely turn to the hope of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Family will be a key value for both of the large generations. For \nthe Millennials, family is their most important value. Nearly eight \nout of ten of the Millennials ranked family as the important issue in \ntheir lives. They told us that they had healthy relationships with \ntheir parents who, for the most part, are Baby Boomers. Some churches \nsay they are family friendly, but few actually demonstrate that \nvalue. Churches that reach both of these generations will make \nsignificant changes to become the type of churches that foster \nhealthy family relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe opportunity to respond\u0014\n\u0014\nWe believe these trends may indeed become reality. They admittedly do \nfocus only on two generations, but these two groups are the largest \ntwo generations in America's history. They cannot be ignored.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrend projecting is a meaningless exercise if it fails to engender \naction. Ultimately each local church must determine where God is \nleading the congregation. In the case of the five trends noted here, \nthe opportunities seem significant. May the response of Christians \nand churches be nothing less than radical obedience.\u0014",

Amish Bury 5th Girl \nSlain at School\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MARK SCOLFORO\u0014\nAssociated Press Writer\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\u0014\nGEORGETOWN, Pa. (AP) -- For the fourth time in two days, the Amish \ngathered for the funeral of a young girl shot by an school intruder \nand solemnly drove to a farmland cemetery by horse and buggy for her \nburial.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 40 buggies trailed a funeral home car, two mounted state \ntroopers and the body of 12-year-old Anna Mae Stoltzfus in a \nhand-sawn wooden coffin under a cold, steady drizzle early Friday \nafternoon. Bearded men in black suits and women in dresses and \nbonnets attended services Thursday for the four other girls killed \nduring Monday's shootings, two of them sisters.\u0014\n\u0014\nA sixth girl shot during the attack was reported in grave condition. \nCounty coroner G. Gary Kirchner said he had been contacted by a \nphysician at Penn State Children's Hospital in Hershey who said \ndoctors expected to take the girl off life support.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour others remain hospitalized.\u0014\n\u0014\nState troopers blocked off all roads into the Nickel Mines village \nduring the funerals Thursday and Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike those the day before, Friday's procession black buggies and \ncarriages also passed the home of Charles Carl Roberts IV, the \n32-year-old milk truck driver who took the girls hostage, tied them \nup and shot them before killing himself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They were just little people,\" Benjamin Nieto, 57, said he watched \nthe processions from a friend's porch Thursday. \"They never got a \nchance to do anything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe funerals Thursday were for 13-year-old Marian Fisher, 7-year-old \nNaomi Rose Ebersol and sisters Mary Liz Miller, 8, and Lena Miller, 7.\u0014\n\t\u0014\nThe girls, in white dresses made by their families, were laid to rest \nin graves dug by hand. Amish custom calls for simple wooden coffins, \nnarrow at the head and feet and wider in the middle. Amish funerals \nare conducted in German and focus on God, not on commemorating the \ndead. There is no singing, but ministers read hymns and passages from \nthe Bible and an Amish prayer book.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe attack was so traumatic that there is talk in the community that \nthe schoolhouse may soon be razed. Many of the Amish have embraced \nRoberts' wife, Marie, and three young children, focusing on their \nbelief in forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nLloyd Welk, Marie Roberts' grandfather, was the only neighbor outside \nwaiting for the last funeral procession as a steady rain tapered to a \nslight drizzle late Friday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nWelk said 16 members of the Roberts family, including Marie Roberts \nand her three children, had a meal together Thursday night. There was \na special prayer before the meal, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think she's holding up real good,\" Welk said. She expects to move \nback into her home and put her children back in school, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarie Roberts has been avoiding news coverage to protect the \nchildren, who have spent the last few days playing ball and riding \ntheir bicycles, Welk said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonors from around the world are pledging money to help the families \nof the dead and wounded. Amounts ranging from $1 to $500,000 have \nbeen received and could help defray mounting medical bills.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the behest of Amish leaders, a fund was also set up for the \nkiller's widow and children.\u0014\n\u0014\n---\u0014",

    "words": "Fatal Revelations\u0014\nMassachusetts battles parents in tiny sect after two children die.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bob Smietana in Attleboro, Massachusetts | posted 05/03/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nAttleboro, Massachusetts, a city of 42,000 on the border with Rhode \nIsland, is witnessing a troubling clash between the rights of parents \nand the responsibility of the state to protect children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe parents of newborn Jeremiah Corneau and 11-month-old Samuel \nRobidoux are accused of allowing them to die. The two sets of parents \nsay the boys died in accordance with God's will. State prosecutors \ncharge that the parents, not God, are responsible. Samuel's parents, \nJacques and Karen Robidoux, face a murder trial that starts this \nmonth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah's parents, Rebecca and David Corneau, have not been charged \nwith a crime. The state has, however, taken their other four children \ninto protective custody. In addition, a juvenile court judge in \nFebruary ordered the Corneaus jailed for refusing to disclose the \nwhereabouts of a baby officials believe was born in late 2001. The \nCorneaus say Rebecca had a miscarriage but refuse to disclose the \nlocation of the child's body. State officials suspect that the child \nis alive and being hidden by family members.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth families belong to The Body, a small, insular sect whose members \nembrace faith healing and reject modern medicine. Members believe \nthey receive direct revelations from God. Sect founders Roland \nRobidoux and Roger Daneau were members of an Attleboro Bible study \nthat evolved into a group of about 20 adult members at its peak in \nthe 1980s. Most members come from their two families. Daneau, 62, was \nfound dead March 7 of an apparent heart attack at the sect's communal \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case has raised important legal questions about state \nintervention in the lives of fervently religious families. \nConstitutional scholar Stephen L. Carter of Yale Law School believes \nthat while parents should have wide latitude in raising their \nchildren, the state must set some limits.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Although I am a strong advocate of respecting parental authority in \ncreating even a very insular religious and moral world for their \nchildren, I also believe that a civilized society must place some \nlimits,\" Carter told CT. \"The law generally places the limit at the \nwell-being of the child.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInside a sect\u0014\n\u0014\nBody member Michelle Mingo believed she received a revelation from \nGod about Karen Robidoux in early 1999. According to journals the \ngroup kept, God was angry with Karen for being \"vain.\" As a penance, \nshe was to drink a gallon of high-fat almond milk. She was also to \nstop giving solid foods to her 10-month-old son, Samuel, who was \nstill nursing.\u0014\nIt soon became apparent that Samuel was not getting enough \nnourishment, and he slowly lost weight during the next six weeks. \nWhen Karen, then 23, began to ask questions, members told her that \nSatan was tempting her to doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to one journal entry, God asks Karen: \"When are you going \nto believe me? It would please me if you took Samuel and left him in \nthe palm of my hand. Fear not and believe. I don't care about Samuel. \nI don't care about the flesh. I don't care about Samuel right now. \nI'm working with you to believe without doubt.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel died a few days before his first birthday in April 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you have someone who is perceived to have a direct connection \nto Godand no checks and balances, no accountabilitythen anything \ngoes,\" says Robert Pardon, executive director of the New England \nInstitute of Religious Research (NEIRR) in Lakeville, Massachusetts. \n\"It's only by the grace of God that more children did not die.\"\u0014\nJeremiah Corneau died during childbirth later in 1999. While his \nparents say Jeremiah was stillborn, state officials believe he was \nborn alive but quickly asphyxiated. Authorities believe Jeremiah \nwould have survived if he had been born in a hospital. Roland and the \nother men from the sect buried the bodies of both children in Maine's \nBaxter State Park in late September.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey would have remained buried, and most likely undiscovered, had it \nnot been for Michelle Mingo's estranged husband, Dennis. A former \nmember of The Body, he took some of the group's journals and turned \nthem over to police. Investigators began a lengthy probe. When \nmembers refused to cooperate, several were jailed for contempt of \ncourt.\u0014\nHelping former members\u0014\n\u0014\nA breakthrough occurred in October 2000 when David Corneau told \nauthorities where the children were buried. Prosecutors had given him \nimmunity in the deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter finding the bodies, police charged Karen Robidoux with \nsecond-degree murder, Jacques with first-degree murder, and Michelle \nMingo with being an accessory before the fact. Authorities took 13 of \nthe group's children into protective custody.\u0014\nBy all accounts, members of The Body lived simple lives before the \ndeaths of Samuel and Jeremiah, sharing a house in nearby Seekonk and \na gray duplex on Knight Avenue in Attleboro. The group would often \nspend evenings singing around the piano or in prayer meetings and \nBible studies.\u0014\n\u0014\nNEIRR's Pardon was appointed as guardian ad litem for the group's \nchildren. Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth Nasif asked Pardon to research \nThe Bodyto read through its journals and interview current and \nformer membersto help him make decisions about the children's future.\u0014\n\u0014\nPardon, a graduate of GordonConwell Theological Seminary and a \nformer Congregational minister, started NEIRR in 1991. In recent \nyears the institute has worked with former members of what Pardon \ncalls \"high-control destructive groups.\" The nonprofit ministry is \nhelping five members adjust to life outside the group.\u0014\n\u0014\nPardon believes Robidoux and Daneau had good intentions when they \nstarted. \"[T]hey were really trying to live a life that demonstrated \ntrue obedience to God,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nThings changed when members of the group read the works of a woman \nnamed Carol Balizet, Pardon says. Balizet runs Home in Zion \nMinistries of Tampa, Florida, which advocates home birth with no \nmedical intervention.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the same time, members of the group began to believe they were \nreceiving direct revelations from God. Eventually the visions came to \nhave more authority than the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Parents who choose to rely on the direct intervention of God to heal \ntheir children, without human intermediaries, are not crazy or evil,\" \nCarter says. \"They are doing what they believe the Lord requires. But \nthey are, in their innocence, pressing the bounds of religious \nfreedom beyond what a civilized society can allow, and that is why \nthey must not be permitted to do it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nState officials continue to be concerned about any new children of \nBody members. Rebecca Corneau was jailed in August 2000 for refusing \nto accept prenatal care while pregnant with her daughter Katarina. \nRebecca was released in October when her daughter was born and taken \ninto state custody. Neighbors reported that Corneau was pregnant \nagain in the fall of 2001, and the state's Department of Social \nServices began another investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Corneaus appeared before Nasif at Attleboro District Court \nin January, they refused to testify and received a two-week jail \nsentence. The Corneaus told Nasif on February 5 that the child died \nin a miscarriage. When they refused to reveal where the child was \nburied, Nasif jailed them for contempt. When they still refused to \ncooperate during an April 10 hearing, the judge ordered them to \nremain in jail until at least June 4.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. W. Carney Jr., the Corneaus' attorney, says the state is punishing \nhis clients for their religious beliefs, not their actions.\u0014\n\"This case raises important issues of religious freedom,\" Carney \nsays, \"based on the fact that the Corneaus are not being punished for \nwhat they did in the past but rather for what they might do in the \nfuture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry Spence, commissioner of the Department of Social Services, says \nthe Corneaus' behavior is the issue. He believes that they could have \nintervened to save Samuel Robidoux.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can believe whatever you want for yourself, but you don't own \nother human souls,\" Spence says. \"You don't own them to dispose of \nthem as you wish.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Why You Shouldnt Call That False Teaching a Heresy \u0014\nHow to tell which errors deserve the ultimate warning label.\u0014\nJUSTIN S. HOLCOMB|           OCTOBER 6, 2015                   \nCHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA group of bloggers seeking reform in Southern Baptist circles \nrecently decried pastor Rick Warren for teaching that God \ncommunicates to believers via dreams. The bloggers named Warren and \nother speakers at a 2015 Hillsong conference heretical preachers \nthat claim extra-biblical revelation from God. To be sure, the \nnature of Gods revelation has been debated throughout church \nhistory, and overemphasis on dream interpretation can be \ntheologically dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\nElsewhere, a UK Christian leader has devoted much of his writing and \nteaching to criticizing Christian Zionismthe belief that the \nfounding of the State of Israel is foretold in Scripture. He and \nothers have begun calling Zionism and its political implications \nheresy in online columns. And their views are not unique: Many \nChristians believe that Zionism is a misreading of Gods promises \nthroughout the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut are these problems of heresy? Both complementarian and \negalitarian leaders have taken to the Internet to call each others \nviews on gender and leadership heresy. That, though their respective \nmovements have officially existed for about 30 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome say the Internet has democratized knowledge. Clearly, it has \nalso democratized theologizing. Anyone with a computer and Wifi \naccess can publish their thoughts and declarations onto a level \npixelated playing field. Some blogs and Twitter accounts exist solely \nto cry foul whenever a well-known preacher makes a controversial \nstatement.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the frequency and volume of the proclamations from these \nsourcesand from those who share and retweet themsuggest that some \nChristians dont understand the significance of right doctrine, or \nthe gravity of heresy charges. Worse, these disputes lead some to \nbelieve that doctrine isnt worth the effort, since it seems only to \nbreed division rather than promote Christlikeness.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven our volatile online atmosphere, Christians in general and \nevangelicals in particular need a clearer definition of heresy. We \nneed to know how to spot the difference between essential truths of \nthe Christian faith and doctrines over which we can disagree and \nstill remain faithful to Christian teaching. Even with a good \ndefinition, doctrinal assessment requires wisdom and discernment. It \noften involves two different ends: first, avoiding overuse of the \nheresy charge, which strips the word of its usefulness; and second, \ncorrecting Christians with beliefs that are false and that can \nundermine the integrity of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Doctrine Is So Important\u0014\n\u0014\nWe may be tempted to think that since theology so easily divides, we \nare better off simply agreeing to disagree. After all, Jesus said \nthat if we love God and others, we are fulfilling the law. Why, \nsome ask, does it matter that we believe the right things about God, \nso long as we love him?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is certainly true that loving God and others is at the heart of \nthe gospel. But Jesus calls us to love God with our heart, soul, \nstrength, and mind. Loving God involves thinking rightly about him, \njust as loving a friend or significant other involves rightly knowing \ntheir interests, beliefs, habits, and history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Israelites taught their children about God, they recalled \nall he had done for them and their forebears. They worshiped the God \nof Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the One who had delivered them out of \nEgypt. And they used specific phrases to describe him and what he had \ndone. These specific phrases distinguished the God of the Israelites \nfrom the gods of their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrthodox statements about the Trinity and Jesus Christ function \nsimilarly. They identify the God we worship and describe his saving \nrelationship to us. Therefore, in order to love God aright, and to be \nassured of the salvation he offers, we must know who God is and what \nhe has done for us in and through Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome today cast the word heretic in a positive light: a courageous \nrebel who thinks outside the box and stands up to the institutional \nchurch. To be sure, some whom the church called heretics have turned \nout to be heroes; think of how the Catholic Church responded to \nGalileo when he asserted that the Earth revolves around the sun.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there is the almost flippant use of the word, as when others use \nit to refer to anyone who doesnt agree with their denominational or \ntheological distinctives.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut just because a word is misused doesnt mean it is no longer \nhelpful.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditionally a heretic is someone who has compromised an essential \ndoctrine, usually by oversimplification, and has thus lost sight of \nwho God truly is or what he has done for us. While most heretics \nthroughout history were asking legitimate questions, they werent \ncalled heretics simply for asking questions. Their answers were the \nproblem, as was their unwillingness to accept clear and detailed \ncorrection. In many cases, the heretics went too far, trying to mold \nthe faith into the shape of unbiblical ideas they found appealing, \nespecially those of pagan Greek philosophy. Or they began to \nemphasize certain ideas in Scripture to the exclusion of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, seee: My Documents/Calling False Teaching a Heresy\u0014",

    "title": "FIVE MYTHS ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER",
    "words": "Myth #1: Luther was a simple monk.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries, biographies on Luther have created an image of \nhim being a simple monk who unexpectedly found a Bible and, out of \ndespair and uncertainty, published Ninety-Five Theses. This makes for \na good story of an unlearned, poor boy standing up against the rich \nestablishment, but things were a little different. Luther was a very \nlearned professor of theology. He was well-trained in philosophy and \nhad an extremely profound knowledge of the Bible. He knew what he was \ndoing and what he could expect on and after October 31, 1517.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth #2: Luther personally nailed the Ninety-Five Theses to a door in \nWittenberg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is such an impressive thought to imagine this monk hammering away \nat the door of the castles chapel in Wittenberg. The scene is \nhighlighted in books and movies on Luther, but unfortunately, the \nstory is a myth. There is no evidence that he did such, and Luther \nnever mentioned that he himself posted the Ninety-Five Theseslet \nalone nailed them to that door. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if he would have wanted to post them himself, Luther wouldnt \nhave been permitted to do so. In most schools and churches today, you \ncannot just affix your posters and other messages on the bulletin \nboard until you ask the janitor for permission. Well, the same was \ntrue in Wittenberg. The janitor of the university was responsible for \nposting messages on that chapel dooressentially the public bulletin \nboard. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat said, Luther did write the Ninety-Five Theses . . . but it was \nthe janitor who posted them. And perhaps using glue rather than nails.\u0014\nHe knew what he was doing and what he could expect on and after \nOctober 31, 1517.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth #3: Luther said, Here I stand.\u0014\n\u0014\nTravel to Wittenberg today and you can purchase a pair of socks \nprinted with the words: Here I stand! The statement encapsulates \nthe moment in 1521 when Luther stood before Emperor Charles V and \nrefused to recant his words and opinions. It is widely believed that \nLuther then said: Here I stand, I can do no other, God help me. \nAmen. \u0014\nThe problem is that we find these words only in later versions of the \nreport of this moment. It is most likely that they were inserted to \nstrengthen Luthers message. Though it proved effective to that end \n(and for modern sock sellers) this, unfortunately, is also a myth.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth #4: Luther was the first to translate the Bible into German.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps Luthers greatest accomplishment was the the Luther Bible. In \na very short period of time while in hiding in Wartburg, he \ntranslated the New Testament, and then later, the Old Testament. \nHowever, it is a myth that Luther was the first one ever to translate \nthe Bible into German. There were, in fact, at least eighteen German \ntranslations of the whole Bible when he began his work. The quality \nand success of Luthers translation, however, meant that the other \neighteen translations were soon forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth #5: Luther said something about planting a tree.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther has often been quoted as saying: Even if I knew that Christ \nwould return tomorrow, I would plant an apple tree today. These are \ngreat words of confidence, action, and expectationbut Luther never \nuttered them. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany years ago a German Luther society offered a reward for the \nperson who could prove where Luther made this statement. The reward \nwas never claimed. While it is a beautiful sentiment, it has not been \nproven that Luther actually expressed it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHerman Selderhuis is professor of church history at the Theological \nUniversity Apeldoorn in the Netherlands and director of Refo500, the \ninternational platform focused on raising awareness for projects \nrelated to the legacy of the Reformation. He also serves as the \ndirector of the Reformation Research Consortium, president of the \nInternational Calvin Congress, and curator of research at the John  \nLasco Library in Emden, Germany. He is the author or editor of \nseveral books, including John Calvin: A Pilgrims Life.\u0014",

    "words": "It's Time to Listen: \"Feeling the Pain Despite the Facts,\" a guest \npost by Bryan Loritts\u0014\nBryan Loritts explains the importance of feeling the pain of \nAfrican-American brothers and sisters. |\u0014\nEd Stetzer\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following is a guest post from Bryan Loritts, pastor of \nFellowship Memphis and author of Right Color, Wrong Culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe slain corpse of Michael Browns body has decimated the myth that \nracism is no longer festering in our hearts. In the aftermath of his \ndemise, there have been riots in his hometown and on social media. In \nthe Christian community, the commentary has likewise been \ncombustible, as one side has appealed to the facts of the \ncaseMichael Brown had just stolen some cigars, and could very well \nhave been the aggressorwhile the other side has spoken out of a deep \nwell of hurt, dug for over four hundred years with the shovel of \nracism and institutionalized segregation, where the value of a black \nlife was on par with that of a horse. Its more than understandable \nwhen African Americans begin to wonder, what exactly is the value of \na black life?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are looking for objectivity from my hand as I write this \narticle, in many ways you will not find it. I am a follower of Jesus \nChrist who so happens to be African American; because of this, there \nis a cultural filter by which I interpret information such as the \nMichael Brown/Ferguson incident. This is what I mean by hermeneutic: \nit is a way we interpret the world. I have one, and so do you.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one level I have a cultural hermeneutic. Seeing and reading the \nstories about Browns death takes me back to the killings of Emmett \nTill in 1955, Medgar Evers in 1963, Dr. King in 1968 and Oscar Grant \nin 2009 (Fruitvale Station). These men were cut down in the prime of \ntheir lives by whites (Emmett Till was 14 when he died). Whats more \nis that Emmett, Medgar, Dr. King, and Oscar are but a few in a long \nhistory of African Americans who have unjustly died at the hands of \nour white brothers. As if thats not enough, in many cases, their \nkillers were never brought to justice, and if they were it was a \nlong-time-coming. So when I see Browns corpse amid reports that he \nwas shot by a representative of both the historic (white) and \nvocational (police) power structure of our country, I hope you will \nfind it more than understandable if I cry foul. I, as a black man, \nfind it impossible not to flinch to present conclusions given the \ninjustices of the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years Ive been challenged by my white brothers and sisters \nto just get over this. Their refusal to attempt to see things from my \nethnically different perspective is a subtle, stinging form of \nracism. Whats more is that it hinders true Christian unity and \nfellowship within the beloved body of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will never experience true Christian unity when one ethnicity \ndemands of another that we keep silent about our pain and travails. \nThe way forward is not an appeal to the facts as a first resort, but \nthe attempt to get inside each others skin as best as we can to feel \nwhat they feel, and understand it. Tragedies like Ferguson are like \nMRIs that reveal the hurt that still lingers. The chasm that exists \nbetween ethnicities can only be traversed if we move past facts and \nget into feelings.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasically there are five levels of communication: 1. Clich; 2. \nFacts; 3. Opinion; 4. Feelings; 5. Transparency, with clich \nrepresenting the most shallow form of communication, and \ntransparency the deepest. I will never know what its like to be a \nwoman, but I do know that when my wife comes at me with level four \n(feelings), and I stay in lawyer-land at level two, this never is a \nrecipe for intimacy. I am not denying facts, but Ive had to learn \nthe hard way that if I am to experience oneness with my bride, I must \ndrop down to level four in an attempt to understand, before I \nresurface to level two. Facts are a first and last resort in a court \nof law, but when it comes to human relationships, let us first stop \nand feel, before we go to facts.The communication pyramid offers a \nrevolutionary paradigm in our journey to understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you sense exasperation from we African-Americans over yet another \nnews story of a black man slain at the hands of a white man, this is \na wonderful opportunity to grab some coffee and seek to understand \nour hearts. I need my white brothers to know how I felt as I sat in \nthe preaching classes in Bible college and seminary not once hearing \nexamples of great African-American preachers. I need you to know how \nI felt when I was forced face down on the hard asphalt of Crenshaw \nBoulevard in Los Angeles, 1993 all because I was nineteen and driving \nmy pastors Lexus, a year after the Rodney King riots. I need you to \nask how I felt when I walked into a Target recently behind a white \nwoman who took one look at me and pulled her purse tightly.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, as much as I am an African-American, I am even more so a \nfollower of Jesus Christ. The death, burial, and resurrection of our \nSavior demands that I subjugate my cultural hermeneutic to my gospel \nhermeneutic. In other words, my Jesus-ness, must trump my blackness. \nAs Dr. Tony Evans says, Black is only beautiful when it is \nbiblical. This is at odds with the teaching of liberation theology, \nwhere you had black theologians like Dr. James Cone who wrote that \nthe gospel is essentially for the oppressed and not the oppressor. \nNot true. If I understand the gospel right, Jesus died for Michael \nBrown and Darren Wilson (his shooter); slaves and slave masters; the \nlynched and the lynch mob. My new gospel hermeneutic, therefore, \nleaves no place for hatred, bitterness or unforgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is room for justice. Just as a pedophile can be redeemed by the \nblood of the Lamb and should go to jail, if it is discovered that \nOfficer Wilson acted inappropriately, he should experience justice. \nThe God we serve is both a forgiving God and a just God. Those two \nthings can cohabitate. My gospel hermeneutic does not allow for a \nheartless apathy that shakes its head and says white people. I can \nnever give up on my white brothers and sisters because God in Christ \nhas never given up on me.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe followers of the Way have been afforded a wonderful opportunity to \nuse the death of Michael Brown and the confusion surrounding Ferguson \nto show to the world lovetrue love. Love for the people there in \nFerguson, and also love for each other. A kind of love that refuses \nto have vicious battles in the comments section of some blog or \nsocial media posta love that sits down over a hot cup of coffee and \nseeks to understand.\u0014",

    "title": "FREDERICK DOUGLAS: PROPHET OF FREEDOM",
    "words": "A unique feature of this biography of Frederick Douglass, is that the \nauthor, David W. Blight, was able to use original manuscripts from a \nprivate collector. There is a mythology surrounding Frederick \nDouglass, some of it created by the three autobiographies that \nDouglass penned. Yet, these newly discovered manuscripts, flesh out \nparticularly the childhood and early years of Douglass's life. \nIndeed, this reviewer believes his life can be viewed as a triptych \nof three overlapping major phases that at times intersected and at \nother times clashed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first period was slavery. Frederick Bailey, Douglass's birth \nname, was given up by his grandmother at the tender age of six when \nhe was left at the plantation of Aaron Anthony. His mother was \n\"rented\" out as a day laborer to another plantation and so the boy \nhad little to no contact with her. She died by the time he was eight \nyears old. Later, he was \"given\" to the brother of his master who \nlived in Baltimore. The author is unsparing in his descriptions of \nenslavement: Frederick was beaten, starved, lonely, impoverished and \nhumiliated. A major watershed occurred when his master's wife taught \nthe boy to read. Her furious husband forbade her from teaching him \nanymore and burned the prized books of the child. Nevertheless, \nFrederick's mind was opened to a new world. He was influenced by \nothers to study particularly the Old Testament which provided him \ninspiration in the words of the prophets and the many illusions and \nmetaphors about slavery and freedom. Was it adolescent rebellion or \nhis new found literacy that inspired Frederick to flee North? Aided \nby a freedwoman who later became his wife, Frederick escaped on the \nUnderground Railroad. Fearing recapture, he changed his surname to \nDouglass.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second phase of Douglass's life was preaching for abolition. He \ntraveled throughout the United States, as well as Britain, Ireland \nScotland and Canada. Douglass was an ardent believer in the need to \nfree all blacks. He delivered thousands of passionate orations; part \nreligious, part personal, but always entertaining and inspiring. He \nrelated incidents from his own enslavement and quoted frequently from \nthe Old Testament. He became world renowned and crossed paths with \nimportant figures including John Brown, who hoped Douglass would join \nhim in the Harper's Ferry raid and Presidents Lincoln, Johnson, Grant \nand Hayes. Throughout the Civil War, Douglass used his fiery speeches \nto recruit blacks to fight for the Union. (Three of his own sons \nfought in the War.) His speeches on \"Peace time Abolition\" focused on \nthe need to give black men the vote and when that was achieved, he \nrailed against the rampant violence against blacks. During \nReconstruction there were wholesale lynchings and murders of blacks. \nHis relentless travels and public speaking engagements took a toll on \nhis family, his pocket book and his health.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily relations was the third essential factor in Douglass's life. \nHaving had no family as a child and unsure of the identity of his \nfather, Douglass put a high premium on being a father and a provider. \nBut, his long and frequent absences created great strain on his wife \nAnna and their five children who lived into adulthood. Anna was \nilliterate and it remains a mystery why Douglass did not teach her to \nread. Douglass strived to be both father and provider, but his long \nabsences eroded both roles. Though he claimed to be a \"self-made \nman\", Douglass relied heavily on financial assistance from \nabolitionists at home and abroad. He also sought the emotional, \nintellectual and perhaps physical support from several white women, \nsome of whom lived for extended periods in the Douglass home. After \nAnna died, he married one of these white women causing further strain \nwith his children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlight's book is well referenced, but rather long. There are times \nwhen it is repetitive and when the author uses \"grandiose\" language, \nperhaps to mimic Douglass's style. Sadly, the author lacks the power, \npassion and poetry of Frederick Douglass. The author also \noccasionally attempts to psychoanalyze Douglass which is a bit of a \nstretch. Despite these flaws, this book provides a thorough \nexamination of a man who made and is a seminal part of American \nhistory.\u0014",

    "title": "FIRST MASS IN THE NEW WORLD",
    "words": "First Mass in the New World\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen Christopher Columbus defied the commonsense of the day and \nsailed west instead of east to find India, he gave as one reason for \ndoing so to take the gospel to the heathen. Clergymen accompanied him \nin his voyages. The Christian faith did indeed come to the new world \nand, as a consequence, numerous churches and cathedrals grace the \ncities of the Americas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first of these many churches was erected at Isabela on the Island \nof Haiti in 1494. It was just a temporary structure, to be sure. Like \nRaleigh at Jamestown, Columbus picked about as poor a site as \npossible for his first \"permanent\" settlement in the New World. The \nharbor was exposed to northern winds. Fresh water was a mile off. \nBigger boats had to anchor half a mile off shore. But Columbus was \nimpatient to begin his hunt for gold.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe feast of Epiphany* that fell on this day, January 6, 1494, was \nhighly significant. On it Columbus and all his men disembarked and \nentered the temporary church that they had built. There they heard \nFray Buil offer mass--the first mass ever heard on land in the New \nWorld, precursor of countless millions more.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Spaniards \"converted\" many Indians in those early years, \none wonders how effectual the conversions were. The brutality of \nColumbus's companions and his ineptitude as an administrator \nguaranteed that hundreds of thousands of Indians perished under the \nhand of the invaders without knowing more of Christianity than the \ngreed and cruelty that wasted them. \u0014\n\u0014\n* Epiphany is a feast having to do with the infancy and baptism of \nChrist. By the fourth century the eastern church observed it as one \nof the three principal feasts of the church year (the other two were \nEaster and Pentecost; Christmas didn't become popular until later). \nIn the western church, which did not get Epiphany until the fourth \ncentury, the feast took on a completely different character. There it \nwas associated with the coming of the magi (wise men) bringing gifts \nto baby Jesus, and scant mention was made of Christ's baptism.

What you once loved is indeed gone, and nobody that hasn't \nlost something precious can possibly fully understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief avoidance is real. After people have delivered the accepted \nlines of empty reassurance along with the casserole, most will \ndisappear for a time. They cannot fix you, so they do not know what \nto do with you. It isn't that they do not love you. It is that they \nfeel scared and helpless in the wake of your unfixable pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile you are feeling the crushing pain of wave after wave of \nreality, I see you rock the ashes of your dreams. I see you double \nover in the agony of your loss. I hear your strangled wails, and I \nknow that you are struggling with the worst of the worst of what \ngrief leaves us in.\u0014\n\u0014\nStop fighting the powerful waves as your heart contracts and takes \nyour breath away. You will get knocked down if you resist. Rather, \nopen yourself and feel what comes. Let the waves flow through you. \nBreathe like youre in labor and wait for the wave to pass. The next \none will come again, but you will have respite in between, until the \nwaves move further apart one day.\u0014\n\u0014\nTime by itself heals nothing. Time does give perspective, and with \nit, hope. You will not always feel the way that you do right now in \nthis moment. But remember, your grief is yours. Let nobody tell you \nhow it should be, or how long it should last. We grieve as we \nlovefully and forever. We grieve the past as well as the future of \nwhat will never be. Just know that when you are ready, things will be \ndifferent. Both bliss and agony are impermanent. For better or for \nworse, this too shall pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nHold this thoughtthere will come a time when you will once again \nfeel joy.

    "words": "FATHER ADMITS BEATING HIS CHILD\u0014\n\u0014\nRichmond Times Dispatch   8/6/19\u0014\n\u0014\nA Hopewell father who told police he disciplined his 2-year-old child \nby \"popping\" him in the chest and legs was convicted Monday of \nkilling the boy, who died of blunt-force trauma in October 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\nAaron Christopher Watford, 28, entered an Alford plea in Hopewell \nCircuit Court to second-degree murder, reduced from first-degree, \nahead of his scheduled trial. Circuit Judge William Edward Tomko II \nconvicted Watford after accepting his plea, noting the evidence was \noverwhelming in the death of Cali'Deen \"Cayden\" Jones, who was two \nmonths shy of his third birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an Alford plea, the defendant does not admit to the crime, but \nacknowledges the prosecution's evidence would be sufficient for a \nfinding of guilt. Watford, who has prior convictions of attempted \nrobbery and felony use of a firearm, will be sentenced later this \nyear.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a summary of evidence presented by Assistant Commonwealth's \nAttorney Matthew Bingham, Hopewell Detective Mark Palumbo responded \nto John Randolph Medical Center on Oct. 13, 2017, for a report of an \nunresponsive child brought to the hospital about 4:38 p.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Cayden was pronounced dead just before 6 p.m., Palumbo observed \nthe toddler's body, noting bruising to his eyes, head, stomach and \nneck. The detective also noticed a circular scar, consistent with a \nburn, on Cayden's inner thigh.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe state medical examiner's officer conducted an autopsy, and \ndetermined Cayden had contusions on his scalp, neck, chest and upper \nabdomen, and abrasions on his knee and thigh.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedical examiners also found bruising on the boy's lung and liver, \nand a number of broken bones in his rib cage. They concluded his \ndeath was a homicide by blunt-force trauma, Bingham said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA neuropathologist at VCU Medical Center examined the autopsy \nevidence, which the doctor said was indicative of acute neural \ntrauma. In her diagnosis, she concluded the child suffered from brain \ndamage caused by oxygen loss, and that it was consistent with \nblunt-force trauma and further supported by the bruising injury to \nCayden's chest.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn anthropological expert who also examined the evidence found \nabdominal trauma and hemorrhaging to three of Cayden's ribs, and in \nX-rays noticed there were fractures present in various states of \nhealing. Some of the fractures occurred before death, and others were \nmore recent and occurred at time of death\u0014\n.\u0014\nThe number and types of fractures were consistent with child abuse \nand inconsistent with other theories about how Cayden came to be \ninjured, the expert concluded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDetectives interviewed Marque Hoyette, the defendant's cousin, who \nallowed Watford, his two children and his girlfriend to live at her \nresidence in Hopewell, where they had moved in 2017 from the \nTidewater region, the prosecutor said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoyette described Watford's demeanor as \"angry\" and that he would \noften get upset with Cayden. She told detectives she never saw \nWatford strike the boy, but saw him take the child to a back room and \nheard \"smacking sounds\" consistent with Watford striking the boy on \nhis chest, Bingham said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoyette said she confronted Watford and he admitted to hitting his \nchild to discipline him. On the day of Hayden's death, Hoyette told \ndetectives she saw Watford slapping the child's face and splashing \nwater on him in an attempt to revive him. She said Watford refused to \ncall 911 and insisted on taking Hayden to the hospital himself\u0014\n.\u0014\nDuring an interview with police, Watford told detectives that he had \nmoved to Hopewell in September and was awarded sole custody of Hayden \nand his twin sister. He said Hayden had previously received medical \ncare at John Randolph for \"falling off a bed\" in an incident that \noccurred a few weeks before the boy's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatford admitted to hitting Cayden in the past, saying, \"Yes, I pop. \nI tap his chest,\" as a form of discipline.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of the police interview, Watford became angry and \nstated, \"I pop my son when he needs to be disciplined regardless of \nwhat the [expletive] my cousin said out of her dumb [expletive] \nmouth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He then proceeded to call Cayden, his 2-year-old son, 'rude as \nhell,'\" the prosecutor told the court.\u0014",

    "title": "FEAR IS THE SLAVEHOLDER RELIGION'S TOOL OF CONTROL",
    "words": "RELIGION'S TOOL OF CONTROL\u0014\nBY JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE       AUG 22, 2019\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nTo mark the 400th anniversary of enslaved Africans arrival in the \nland that would become the United States, the New York Times \nMagazines Nikole Hannah Jones edited a special project to show how \nsystemic racism has shaped America and celebrate the ways black \npeople have, nevertheless, worked to preserve and reconstruct \nAmerican democracy. The resulting 1619 Project landed on newsstands \nSunday morning. Before most church-going folks had made it home for \nSunday lunch, conservative pundits were attacking the project. FOX \nNews commentator Newt Gingrich called it a lie, while the white \nevangelical radio host Erick Erickson tweeted if the land in which \nthe United States was founded has been tainted by racism since the \n1600s and everything derived therefrom is therefore tainted, then \nthe US is illegitimate and revolution is the answer.\u0014\n\u0014\nEriksons fear of black power is certainly not original. It is a \nproduct of Americas plantation economy just as much as the cotton \nthat enslaved people picked and the sermons that were preached to \nsave their souls without disrupting their bondage. Over and against \nthis nations abolitionist movements, slaveholder religion emerged in \nAmerica to bless a nation that promised liberty while relying on \nrace-based chattel slavery. While this peculiar form of Christianity \ninsisted that enslaved people had souls and should be evangelized, it \nalso reimagined them as creatures ordained for servitude. Because \nslaveholder religions god ordained white supremacy, white people \nlearned to fear equality and the black political power that \nchallenged the social order they were taught to value.\u0014\n\u0014\nFear became slaveholder religions tool of control, inspiring \nmillions of poor white families in the South to send sons to war and \npray for victory, even as the white sons of plantation owners avoided \ncombat. During Reconstruction, when black and white representatives \nworked together in Southern legislatures to guarantee public \neducation for all people, many poor white children went to school for \nthe first time; many poor white people received healthcare at \nFreedmans Bureau hospitals. Still, their preachers told them to be \nafraid. Even when black power helped poor white people in measurable \nways, slaveholder religion taught white people to fear shared power.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly a century later, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led \na moral movement to reconstruct democracy in America, he knew that it \nwould require dispelling the myths of slaveholder religion. The poor \nin white skins  are chained by the weight of discrimination though \nits badge of degradation does not mark them, he told the NAACPs \nLegal Defense Fund in 1965. Systemic racism conspired to keep both \nblack and white people poor, King understood, because the same \npoliticians who played on poor white peoples racial fears also \nopposed their rights as workers. A year later, at the end of the \nSelma to Montgomery March, King observed how this divide-and-conquer \ntactic became a matter of faith for white conservatives. If it may \nbe said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave \nthe Negro Jesus, King taught, then it may be said of the \nReconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and \ngave the poor white man Jim Crow. Segregation wasnt simply a social \nconstruct; it was a whole belief system based on fear of black \npolitical and economic power.\u0014\n\u0014\nTodays conservative movement has tried to eschew its connection to \nracist fear and the long history of white supremacy in America. Its \nspokesmen often repudiate the rouge violence of the Ku Klux Klan and \nblame segregation on Democrats, obscuring the link between todays \nRepublican Party and the Southern Democrats who made white supremacy \na plank of their party during the Jim Crow era. But the conservative \nfamily values around which they organized after the success of the \n20th centurys civil rights movement served to form a voting \ncoalition of white people in the South, the suburbs, and the Sunbelt. \nThat coalition has resisted the expansion of equal protection under \nlaw that the civil rights movement advocated and has leaned into the \nfear of slaveholder religion to motivate its based. Ahead of the 2016 \nelection, leaders of the religious right made it a talking point to \nsay this election might be their last chance to stand up for \nbiblical values. Thus far, this fear has been enough to justify the \nseparation and abuse of immigrant families, the rejection of \nrefugees, and every effort by the Trump administration to undermine \ndemocracy through voter suppression and Census manipulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week, before Fox News had told its viewers to reject the 1619 \nProject, three generations of my white Southern family made a \npilgrimage to Fort Monroe in Virginia. We were the only people on the \nNational Park tour that day, but two young African-American women \nwalked us through 400 years of history all the same. From the place \nwhere 20 and odd Negroes were first recorded to the 500-year-old \nlive oak under which formerly enslaved people gathered to learn to \nread during the Civil War, we listened to the stories of people who \nprayed for freedom in a land that promised liberty but denied their \nhumanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAcross the sound on the campus of Hampton University, we stood \nbeneath the Emancipation Oak where both that institution of higher \neducation and the dream of education for all people in Virginia was \nborn during Reconstruction. I thought about my great-grandmother, a \nwhite woman who grew up in the hills of Southern Virginia some fifty \nyears later but never learned to read. Jim Crow conspired to keep her \nfamily poor along with their black neighbors. But when I attended \ndesegregated kindergarten in the 1980s, she lived with my family and \nsat at the dinner table each afternoon, determined to learn her \nletters along with her grandson. Thanks to the efforts of black \npeople in Americas First and Second Reconstruction, I received both \na free public education and the good news that the democracy black \npeople have always wanted is good news for people like me.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor 400 years, slaveholder religion has told people who look like me \nto be afraid of black political power. But underneath the \nEmancipation Oak, it was clear that my family has nothing to fear. \nMuch of what we have to give thanks for was given to us by black \npeople who sacrificed to reconstruct America. Love casts out all \nfear, Jesus told us. I pray that some of us whove been given much \nin this land can love America enough to cast out the lies that hold \nus all captive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Wilson-Hartgrove \u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Wilson-Hartgrove directs the School for Conversion in \nDurham, N.C.

    "words": "Thousands showed up for the funeral of a Florida veteran with no \nfamily. Then the truth came out. \u0014\nBy Antonia Noori Farzan / The Washington Post    10/11/19\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the day of Edward K. Pearson's funeral, traffic in Sarasota, \nFlorida, came to a standstill. An estimated 4,000 people showed up to \npay their respects to the 80-year-old Army veteran, and the roads \nwere so jammed that the service had to be delayed for nearly an hour \nwhile the car carrying his ashes was stuck in transit.\u0014\n\u0014\nHardly any of the mourners packing Sarasota National Cemetery for the \nfull military funeral on Oct. 1 had met the man they were there to \nhonor. Instead, they had come because of a brief obituary that had \ngone viral, saying that the elderly veteran had no immediate family \nand inviting the public to attend his memorial service.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a heartwarming story.

Until their father's obituary \nwent viral, they had been under the impression that he was dead. But \neven though the two men came forward the day before the service, the \nfuneral home didn't inform the public that Pearson did, indeed, have \nliving family members.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"At the very least, it should have been mentioned at the service that \nfamily had been found,\" Anderson wrote on Tuesday. \"It was not \nmentioned. Instead, a Legacy Options funeral director spoke about the \nservices his business provides.\"\u0014",

The pace was leisurely so he enjoyed \nthe job.  Toward the middle of the afternoon, however, he was sent up \nto the attic--a dingy place full of cobwebs and infested with mice.  \n\"You will find a long, deep box there,\" explained Mr. Peters.  \n\"Please sort out the contents and see what should be saved.\"  John \nwas disappointed.  It was a large container, and there seemed to be \nnothing in it but old junk.  After a few minutes he went back to the \nground floor. Asked by the proprietor if he had completed his work, \nhe replied, \"No, sir, it was dark and cold up there and I didn't \nthink it was worth doing.\" At closing time he was paid and told not \nto return.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning the old sign \"BOY WANTED\" appeared in its usual \nplace.  Crawford Hill was the next to be employed.  When he was asked \nto tidy up the same box, however, he spent hours separating the \nusable nails and screws from the things to be discarded.  Suddenly he \nraced down the stairs all excited.  \"At the very bottom I found \nthis!\" he exclaimed, holding up a 20- dollar bill.  At last the store \nowner had discovered a conscientious boy to whom he could entrust his \nbusiness when he retired.  Years later Mr. Peters said, \"This young \nman, who is now my successor, found his fortune in a junk box!\" Then, \ncorrecting himself, he added, \"No he actually found it in his \nmother's Bible because he heeded the verse she made him memorize:  \n'He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in \nmuch!'\"\u0014",

Several years ago \nwhen Dennis De Haan spoke in a church in Cortland, New York, one of \nthe deacons told him he had recently met De Haan's high school \nfootball coach.  The man from Cortland had mentioned that a speaker \nfrom Michigan by the name of Dennis De Haan was coming to his church. \nImmediately a light flashed in the other man's mind.  Someone by that \nname played football when he coached in Zeeland, Michigan.  So after \n25 years, a little bit of De Haan's former life surfaced in the \npresent.  He wondered if the coach might also have recalled some of \nhis mistakes on the gridiron?\u0014\n\u0014\n  Being reminded of a few football errors is harmless enough, but \nbeing haunted by sins we wish to forget can be disturbing. They can \ncrop up long after we think they've been forgotten.  To be free from \nthe specter of a shameful past, we must face up to it.  Writing to \nTimothy, Paul spoke of his own sinful conduct before he had become a \nChristian.   He neither justified it nor denied it, but admitted it.  \nYet he wasn't harassed by it, because Christ had stricken it from the \nrecord and had given him a new life.  His past was truly a thing of \nthe past.\u0014",

Max was \nbeginning to wonder if they would make it back.\u0014\n\u0014\n   He sat in the front of the boat looking back toward his father, \nwho was sitting in the stern with his hand on the throttle.  He had \nheaded the small craft toward the nearest beach, and they were making \nsome progress, but the waves were getting bigger.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Max looked for the sun, but it was hidden by the clouds.  He \nsquinted through the rain, trying to make out the trees along the \nshore, but he couldn't see them.  All he could see was waves. The \nonly reassuring sight was his father's face, as he peered into the \nstorm with his jaw set, grimacing.  Water dripped off his baseball \ncap; his shirt was soaked and sticking to his skin.\u0014\n\u0014\n   At that moment Max decided to quit looking at the storm and look \nonly at his dad.
