    "words": "A special issue on South Africa. Part 1.  Quote from Desmond Tutu's \nguest editorial:  \"Our God knows our human condition from inside.  He \ndid not shout good advice from a safe distance.  He was embroiled in \nthe muck, in the suffering, in the confusion and misunderstanding.  \nHe was a baby. He was born.  He lived. He died.  He rose again. \nChrist's life says God cared, God still cares, that babies matter, \nthat family life matters, that homes matter, that people matter, that \ndecent living matters, that relationships matter, and that our \nexistence matters--matters so much that God glorified it by becoming \na human baby.  God be praised.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Suffering made bearable\" by Desmond Tutu. International \nChristian Digest, Mar 1989.  Page 3.\u0014\n  Part 2. A biography of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, substantiating the \nclaims that he is a thoroughgoing incarnational theologian who claims \nthat Christians (with God) must opt for the poor, the powerless, and \nthe marginalized, and that such activities are no more subversive \nthan the Bible itself. \"Desmond Tutu\" by Simon Maimela.  Pages 6-8.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Part 3. The general secretary of the South African Council of \nChurches gives his reasons why anti-communist rhetoric isn't \nconvincing in South Africa:  1) Black South Africa has never been \npart of East-West ideological conflict and the related cold war. 2) \nThe people who try to sell anti-communism are the oppressors. 3) \nCommunist countries have shown themselves willing to assist blacks in \nbeing free from the apartheid system. The church usually addresses \n\"secondary\" sin rather than \"primary\" sin. \"The church highlights the \nsinfulness of people who steal-- from their bosses--without \naddressing the sin of those who cause them to be poor--by exploiting \nthem at work in the first place.\"  \"Why anti-communist rhetoric won't \nwork in South Africa\" by Frank Chikane. Pages 9, 10.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Part 4. A quote from Allan Boesak, moderator of the Dutch Reformed \nMission Church:  \"I want to say this as calmly as I can, Mr. \nGovernment Minister. You can threaten us all you like. Let your \nsecurity police terrorize our children, come into the streets and \ninto our churches and massacre us, because Jesus Christ is Lord.  The \nbattle is on, but no government can challenge the living God and \nsurvive.  That, Mr. Minister, is the good news for the people of God \nand the bad for you. Jesus Christ is Lord.\" \"Demanding God's justice\" \nby Allan Boesak. Page 13.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Part 5. A quote from Tshenuwani Farisani, deputy bishop of the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa:  \"The apartheid thief is \n13 percent of the population but he wants 87 percent of the oxygen \nfor himself and 100 percent of the carbon monoxide for black people.  \nWhoever buys from the thief is accessory to the thefts, and \nencourages the profession.  If there were no buyers for the apartheid \nmerchandise, the apartheid shop would close down, and the factory of \nracism would declare bankruptcy before humankind and before God.\" \n\"Apartheid shall surely die!\" by Tshenuwani Simon Farisani. Pages 14, \n15 Other articles include an interview with Beyers Naude, a white who \nmight have become the prime minister of South Africa had he not \nbecome convinced of the evil of the apartheid, and a debate on \nbenefits of U.S. sanctions. \"Beyers Naude: love when others hate\" by \nJim Wallis.

    "title": "SEX AND THE CHURCH",
    "words": "\"The Church refuses to muffle what it regards as Christ's own \nmoral standard, but its witness is hobbled by the scandal that \nhundreds of its priests have sexually abused children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Roman Catholic Church in America is divided over issues of sex \nand gender.  Large numbers of members oppose the Church's traditional \nteachings on contraception, abortion rights, ordination of women as \npriests, marriage as an option for priests, premarital sex, and \nhomosexuality.  A recent Newsweek poll shows that the majority of \nAmerican Catholics differ with the Vatican's official teaching on \nevery one of these issues. Add to this the complication of hundreds \nof priests accused of child molestation, and we see a church in \nturmoil.\u0014\n\u0014\n   On Pope Paul II's recent visit to the United States, he met for \nthe first time with President Clinton, who was strongly supported in \nlast fall's election by homosexual and abortion rights advocates, and \nby 44% of Catholic voters.  Yet Catholics, many of whom presumably \nvoted for Clinton, are furious over his choice for surgeon general, \nDr. Joycelyn Elders, an avid prochoicer.\u0014\n\u0014\n   With the near collapse of the institutions of marriage and the \nfamily in America over the last 30 years, old norms of sexual \nbehavior have also taken a tumble.  Along with shifting sexual mores \ncame the mass exodus to the suburbs, where the sense of community \nthat once reinforced Church values about sex and marriage has also \neroded.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When the papal encyclical \"Humanae Vitae\" was issued in 1968, most \nCatholics hoped the Vatican would modify its stance on birth control, \nbut they were disappointed.  Most married Catholics and numerous \ntheologians have taken the view that contraception is a \"moral and \npractical necessity.\"  Rather than uniting Catholics, the Humanae \nVitae has, for some 25 years, divided the Catholic community on \nissues of sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Younger Catholics no longer see Rome as their authority in sexual \nmatters.  In addition to divergent views on birth control and \npremarital sex, there is widespread sentiment favoring optional \ncelibacy for priests, the ordination of women as priests, and even \nmonogamous homosexual marriages.  Issues like the high rates of both \ndivorce and teen pregnancy in the U.S., along with concerns about \nAIDS, date rape, and ambiguous gender roles are also major concerns \nof Catholics today.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In the Church's effort to teach its members high standards of \nsexual behavior, it has been severely hampered by the immoral actions \nof numerous priests accused of child molestation. The scandal, a \ndecade in the making, has caused many Catholics to lose their sense \nof trust in their priests and in the Church as a whole.  What has \nmade a bad situation even worse is the apparent \"cleansing,\" not of \npriests, but of diocesan personnel records.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Newsweek's poll found that most Catholics thought the Church had \ntreated abusing priests too leniently.  The Church has begun its \ndamage control plan:  archdioceses are searching personnel records \nfor evidence of abuse, and American emissaries to the Vatican urged \nthe defrocking of sexually abusive priests. The Pope responded, \nhowever, by appointing another commission to \"study the issue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Many questions arise concerning the connections, if any, between \nthe celibate priesthood and child molestation.  All organizations \nthat work with youth are vulnerable to child abuse, says Greg Graze, \nspokesman of the Boy Scouts.  While most incidents of abuse within \nchurches occur in the Roman Catholic fold, no denomination is \nimmune.  Counselors say that pedophilia and ephebophilia (attraction \nto a youngster in puberty) are similar to alcoholism in that \ntendencies can be halted, but never totally cured.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Writing from a priest's perspective, Andrew Greely (in a followup \narticle) notes that celibacy in the priesthood has been honored more \nat some times and places in history than others. It has always been \ndifficult to honor the pledge of celibacy, but never impossible.  \nSince most documented pedophiles are married men, Greely refuses to \nblame celibacy for sexual abuse by priests.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Sex and the church\" by Kenneth Woodward.

    "title": "SHOULD WE CLONE HUMANS?",
    "words": "\"Human cloning is not just another technological step to be \njudged in terms of its effects on those cloned. What [it] would do to \nall of us [raises] intertwined theological questions of the first \nmagnitude.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   A significant ethical debate was touched off last fall when a \ndoctor at the George Washington University Medical Center succeeded \nin cloning human embryos.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Some commentators, viewing the issue strictly as a matter of the \nautonomy of the individual, argue that society has no right to invade \nthe privacy of those who produce (and therefore own) the embryos.  \nOthers who emphasize how cloning can help childless couples see this \ntechnology (along with any other that solves the problem of \ninfertility) as morally acceptable.  Both of these approaches are \nextremely short-sighted because cloning humans is not merely a \nprivate matter; it is a three-dimensional question of social ethics.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Wholeness.  The notion of eugenics, the preferential breeding of \ngenetically superior individuals, has gained a surprising amount of \npublic acceptance in our culture, as seen in offhanded references to \n\"the right to a healthy child,\" which necessitates a corresponding \nright to reject the imperfect.  We now have the medical capability of \ndiagnosing genetic defects prior to birth, and the courts have ruled \non a number of \"wrongful life\" suits in which the child alleges the \nparents committed a crime by allowing him or her to be born.  A \nmultitude of problems arise out of the practice of eugenics (What \ndefects are unacceptable?  What attributes are most desirable? Who \ndecides?), but the major concern is the way it perverts \nattitudes--society begins to value an individual only in terms of the \nspecific characteristic he or she was genetically engineered to have.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Uniqueness.  Human diversity (racial, cultural, sexual) is a \nquintessential aspect of our having been created in the image of \nGod.  We must resist any development that collapses the individual \ninto a mere collection of genetic data.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Sanctity of life.  Pre-embryos are alive, and they are human.  \nGiven the proper circumstances, each fertilized ovum has the \npotential to move through the developmental stages of becoming a \nperson.  If we begin regarding pre-embryos as nonpersons, how long \nwill it be until the same attitude is extended to embryos?  It will \nonly further erode our corporate respect for nascent human life.  \n\"Progress\" in medical technology has a tendency to be irreversible; \nit is almost impossible to backtrack even when abuses become apparent \nfurther down the road.\u0014\n\u0014\n   We need uniform national controls to ensure that the pre-embryo is \ntreated as a person.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Should we clone humans?\" by Richard McCormick.

    "words": "\"Death of culture is a necessary product and parallel to the \nculture of death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   If Christians are going to influence America's \"culture of death,\" \nsays Southern Baptist Seminary president Albert Mohler, we \"must \nrecover our own moral authority.\"  That can happen only when we are \nliving in submission to the Lord's authority, he says.  The church's \nmandate is to \"let the light shine in the darkness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The church is a \"cognitive minority,\" in a culture of darkness \nwhere abortion, violence, homosexuality, the increasing acceptance of \ndivorce, and a general revolt against authority prevail.  The church \nmust be a \"culture of life,\" defending life at every level, from the \nwomb to the nursing home.  We are to bear witness to the truth of \nGod's wrath against sin and of His glorious grace in redemption.  We \nare to live in hope because of our confidence in the One in whom our \nhope is placed.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The 20th century has been one of increasing death, Mohler says, \nciting as evidence the two world wars, the concentration camps, and \nthe atomic bomb.  Now RU486 is on the horizon, and bills to prevent \nlate-term abortion are stalled in Congress.  The uncertainty of the \nfuture produces anxiety in our culture.  The church of Jesus Christ \nmust begin to \"pass the light from candle to candle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Salvaging America's culture of death\" by David Porter.  SBC Life, \nMay 1997.  Page 13.

He was in good health, which hadn't always been the case in \nthose\u0014\nrecord-breaking voyages.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years earlier, touching down after 211 days in space, two \ncosmonauts\u0014\nsuffered from dizziness, high pulse rates and heart palpitations. They\u0014\ncouldn't walk for a week. After 30 days, they were still undergoing \ntherapy\u0014\nfor atrophied muscles and weakened hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt zero gravity, the muscles of the body begin to waste away because \nthere is\u0014\nno resistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo counteract this, the Soviets prescribed a vigorous exercise \nprogram for the\u0014\ncosmonauts. They invented the \"penguin suit,\" a running suit laced \nwith\u0014\nelastic bands. It resists every move the cosmonauts make, forcing \nthem to\u0014\nexert their strength. Apparently the regimen is helping.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe often long dreamily for days without difficulty, but God knows \nbetter.

You may glance at her, so\u0014\nlong as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot \nkeep your\u0014\neyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Three:\u0014\nI am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to\u0014\nwear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off \ntheir hips.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlease don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends \nare\u0014\ncomplete idiots.

However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact,\u0014\ncome off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take \nmy\u0014\nelectric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your\u0014\nwaist.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Four:\u0014\nI'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without \nutilizing a\u0014\n\"barrier method\" of some kind can kill you.  Let me elaborate, when it\u0014\ncomes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Five:\u0014\nIn order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about \nsports,\u0014\npolitics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this.  The \nonly\u0014\ninformation I require from you is an indication of when you expect to\u0014\nhave my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need \nfrom\u0014\nyou on this subject is \"early.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Six:\u0014\nI have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to\u0014\ndate other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my\u0014\ndaughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you \nwill continue\u0014\nto date no one but her until she is finished with you.

If you want to be \non\u0014\ntime for the movie, you should not be dating.

Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something\u0014\nuseful, like changing the oil in my car?\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Eight:\u0014\nThe following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter:\u0014\nPlaces where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden\u0014\nstool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within\u0014\neyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is \ndancing,\u0014\nholding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is\u0014\nwarm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff\u0014\nT-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose \ndown parka\u0014\nzipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual \ntheme are to\u0014\nbe avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games \nare\u0014\nokay. Old folks homes are better.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Nine:\u0014\nDo not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, \nmiddle-aged,\u0014\ndimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the\u0014\nall-knowing, merciless potentate of your universe. If I ask you where\u0014\nyou are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the \ntruth, the whole\u0014\ntruth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five\u0014\nacres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule Ten:\u0014\nBe afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the\u0014\nsound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice\u0014\npaddy outside of Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the\u0014\nvoices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for \nyou to\u0014\nbring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway, you\u0014\nshould exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the \nperimeter\u0014\npassword, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter\u0014\nhome safely and early, then return to your car--there is no need for \nyou\u0014\nto come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.\u0014",

The main danger,  apparently, is that the organic components \nof\u0014\n  this aroma may break down ozone (I'm not making this stuff up).\u0014\n\u0014\n  I was horrified. When are we going to do something about bread-\u0014\n  induced global warming?

Subjects deprived of bread\u0014\n     and given only water to eat begged for bread after only two days.\u0014\n\u0014\n  8: Bread is often a \"gateway\" food item, leading the user to \n\"harder\"\u0014\n      items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter and even cold cuts.\u0014\n\u0014\n  9: Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is \nmore\u0014\n      than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead \nto\u0014\n      your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, \nturning you\u0014\n      into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person.\u0014\n\u0014\n  10: New-born babies can choke on bread.\u0014\n\u0014\n  11: Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees \nFahrenheit!\u0014\n       That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute.\u0014\n\u0014\n  12: Most American bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish \nbetween\u0014\n       significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical \nbabbling.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In light of these frightening statistics, we propose the following \nbread\u0014\n   restrictions:\u0014\n\u0014\n  1: No advertising of bread within 1000 feet of a school.\u0014\n\u0014\n  2: A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the \nsocietal\u0014\n     ills we might associate with bread.\u0014\n\u0014\n  3: No animal or human images, nor any primary colours (which may\u0014\n     appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.\u0014\n\u0014\n  4: A $4.2 zillion fine on the three biggest bread manufacturers.\u0014",

He said when\u0014\nhe first came to the United States from Russia, he wasn't\u0014\nprepared for the incredible variety of instant products\u0014\navailable in American grocery stores. He says, \"On my first\u0014\nshopping trip, I saw powdered milk--you just add water, and you\u0014\nget milk. Then I saw powdered orange juice--you just add water,\u0014\nand you get orange juice. And then I saw baby powder, and I\u0014\nthought to my self, What a country!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most basic assumptions made about life change is that\u0014\nit happens instantly at salvation. According to this belief,\u0014\nwhen someone gives his  or her life to Christ, there is an\u0014\nimmediate, substantive, in-depth, miraculous change in habits,\u0014\nattitudes, and character. As a result disciples are born not\u0014\nmade.\u0014\n\u0014\n. . .The question for rethinking discipleship is this: Are these\u0014\nassumptions valid? If they are, then working this formula in the\u0014\nlife of the church should consistently give the same result: a\u0014\nnew community of people who are becoming increasingly like Jesus\u0014\nin their life and thought. If that is not the answer a church\u0014\ngets when it wroks the equation, then it needs to rethink\u0014\nwhether the formula is sound.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, many churches are not getting the correct answer.\u0014\nIn fact, a Search Institute study has found that only 11 percent\u0014\nof churchgoing teenagers have a well-developed faith, rising to\u0014\nonly 32 percent for churchgoing adults. Why? Because true life\u0014\nchange only begins at salvation, takes more than just time, is\u0014\nabout trainig not trying, and is a team effort.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Enery White, Rethinking the Chruch, Baker, 1997, p. 55-57.\u0014",

    "words": "Broadband\u0014\n\u0014\nA type of data transmission in which a single medium (wire) can carry\u0014\nseveral channels at once. Cable TV, for example, uses broadband\u0014\ntransmission. In contrast, baseband transmission allows only one \nsignal\u0014\nat a\u0014\ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMicrofiber\u0014\n\u0014\nA technology that uses glass (or plastic) threads (fibers) to transmit\u0014\ndata.\u0014\nA fiber optic cable consists of a bundle of glass threads, each of \nwhich\u0014\nis\u0014\ncapable of transmitting messages modulated onto light waves.\u0014\n\u0014\nFiber optics has several advantages over traditional metal \ncommunications\u0014\nlines:\u0014\n\u0014\n       Fiber optic cables have a much greater bandwidth than metal\u0014\ncables. This\u0014\nmeans that they can carry more data.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Fiber optic cables are less susceptible than metal cables to\u0014\ninterference.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Fiber optic cables are much thinner and lighter than metal\u0014\nwires.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Data can be transmitted digitally (the natural form for \ncomputer\u0014\ndata)\u0014\nrather than analogically.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main disadvantage of fiber optics is that the cables are \nexpensive to\u0014\ninstall. In addition, they are more fragile than wire and are \ndifficult\u0014\nto\u0014\nsplit.\u0014\n\u0014\nFiber optics is a particularly popular technology for local-area\u0014\nnetworks.\u0014\nIn addition, telephone companies are steadily replacing traditional\u0014\ntelephone lines with fiber optic cables. In the future, almost all\u0014\ncommunications will employ fiber optics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBandwidth\u0014\n\u0014\nThe amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time. \nFor\u0014\ndigital devices, the bandwidth is usually expressed in bits per\u0014\nsecond(bps)\u0014\nor bytes per second. For analog devices, the bandwidth is expressed in\u0014\ncycles per second, or Hertz (Hz).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bandwidth is particularly important for I/O devices. For example, \na\u0014\nfast\u0014\ndisk drive can be hampered by a bus with a low bandwidth. This is the\u0014\nmain\u0014\nreason that new buses, such as AGP,  have been developed for the PC.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIP\u0014\n\u0014\nAbbreviation of Internet Protocol, pronounced as two separate \nletters. IP\u0014\nspecifies the format of packets, also called datagrams, and the\u0014\naddressing\u0014\nscheme. Most networks combine IP with a higher-level protocol called\u0014\nTransport Control Protocol (TCP), which establishes a virtual \nconnection\u0014\nbetween a destination and a source.\u0014\nIP by itself is something like the postal system. It allows you to\u0014\naddress a\u0014\npackage and drop it in the system, but there's no direct link between \nyou\u0014\nand the recipient. TCP/IP, on the other hand, establishes a connection\u0014\nbetween two hosts so that they can send messages back and forth for a\u0014\nperiod\u0014\nof time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe current version of IP is IPv4. A new version, called IPv6 or \nIPng, is\u0014\nunder development.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwitches\u0014\n\u0014\n (1) In networks, a device that filters and forwards packets between \nLAN\u0014\nsegments. Switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI\u0014\nReference Model and therefore support any packet protocol. LANs that \nuse\u0014\nswitches to join segments are called switched LANs or, in the case of\u0014\nEthernet networks, switched Ethernet LANs.\u0014\n(2) A small lever or button. The switches on the back of printers and \non\u0014\nexpansion boards are called DIP switches. A switch that has just two\u0014\npositions is called a toggle switch.\u0014\n(3) Another word for option or parameter -- a symbol that you add to a\u0014\ncommand to modify the command's behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRing network\u0014\n\u0014\nA local-area network (LAN) whose topology is a ring. That is, all of \nthe\u0014\nnodes are connected in a closed loop. Messages travel around the ring,\u0014\nwith\u0014\neach node reading those messages addressed to it. One of the \nadvantages\u0014\nof\u0014\nring networks is that they can span larger distances than other types \nof\u0014\nnetworks, such as bus networks, because each node regenerates \nmessages as\u0014\nthey pass through it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nScalable\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) A popular buzzword that refers to how well a hardware or software\u0014\nsystem\u0014\ncan adapt to increased demands. For example, a scalable network system\u0014\nwould\u0014\nbe one that can start with just a few nodes but can easily expand to\u0014\nthousands of nodes. Scalability can be a very important feature \nbecause\u0014\nit\u0014\nmeans that you can invest in a system with confidence you won't \noutgrow\u0014\nit.\u0014\n(2) Refers to anything whose size can be changed. For example, a font \nis\u0014\nsaid to be scalable if it can be represented in different sizes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nServer\u0014\n\u0014\nA computer or device on a network that manages network resources. For\u0014\nexample, a file server is a computer and storage device dedicated to\u0014\nstoring\u0014\nfiles. Any user on the network can store files on the server. A print\u0014\nserver\u0014\nis a computer that manages one or more printers, and a network server \nis\u0014\na\u0014\ncomputer that manages network traffic. A database server is a computer\u0014\nsystem that processes database queries.\u0014\n\u0014\nServers are often dedicated, meaning that they perform no other tasks\u0014\nbesides their server tasks. On multiprocessing operating systems,\u0014\nhowever, a\u0014\nsingle computer can execute several programs at once. A server in this\u0014\ncase\u0014\ncould refer to the program that is managing resources rather than the\u0014\nentire\u0014\ncomputer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nApplication\u0014\n\u0014\nA program or group of programs designed for end users. Software can be\u0014\ndivided into two general classes: systems software and applications\u0014\nsoftware. Systems software consists of low-level programs that \ninteract\u0014\nwith\u0014\nthe computer at a very basic level. This includes operating systems,\u0014\ncompilers, and utilities for managing computer resources.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, applications software (also called end-user programs)\u0014\nincludes\u0014\ndatabase programs, word processors, and spreadsheets. Figuratively\u0014\nspeaking,\u0014\napplications software sits on top of systems software because it is\u0014\nunable\u0014\nto run without the operating system and system utilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright (c) 1996-1998 Mecklermedia Corp.\u0014",

People who have depression experience at least five of \nthe following symptoms, which must include the first or second nearly \nevery day, all day, for at least two weeks:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tPersistent feelings of sadness or emptiness\u0014\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies that were once \nenjoyed, including sex\u0014\n\tFeelings of helplessness, guilt and worthlessness\u0014\n\tInsomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping\u0014\n\tChange in appetite\u0014\n\tDecreased energy, fatigue, and feeling slowed down\u0014\n\tRestlessness and irritability\u0014\n\tDifficulty concentrating and remembering\u0014\n\tThoughts of suicide or suicide attempts\u0014\n\tPersistent physical symptoms that do not respond to medical treatment\u0014\n\u0014\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\u0014\nBipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) is a condition in which \nan individual experiences severe lows (depressive) alternating with \nextreme, inappropriate highs (mania).\u0014\n\u0014\nA MANIC EPISODE IS characterized by a distinct period of mood change \nthat is either elevated (to the point of elation), expansive, or \nirritable. During this phase, which may last from several days t~ a \nfew months, the patient's behavior causes difficulties in both \nprofessional and social activities. Symptoms of a manic phase may \ninclude:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDecreased need for sleep\u0014\n\tIncreased pressure of speech\u0014\n\tDistractibility and/or irritability\u0014\n\tExcessive involvement in activities that have a high risk for pain \nconsequences that are not recognized\u0014\n\tInflated self-esteem or grandiosity\u0014\n\u0014\nThe patient may become psychotic with delusions and hallucinations. \nFrequently, those experiencing a manic episode do not realize they \nare affected and will therefore resist any medical treatment attempt. \nClose friends will recognize the mood and behavior patterns as being \nexcessive, while the casual observer may not see anything disturbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nA DEPRESSIVE EPISODE usually lasts two weeks to many months, during \nwhich time the patient will experience a lack of interest or pleasure \nin all activities. Patients may describe themselves as feeling sad or \nblue, devoid of motivation or worth. These feelings and thoughts may \nor\u0014\nmay not be stated openly in front of others. Symptoms of a depressive \nphase may include:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSleep disturbance (sleeping more or less than usual)\u0014\n\tChange in appetite\u0014\n\tFeeling sad, worthless, or guilty without cause\u0014\n\tConcentration difficulties\u0014\n\tThoughts of death and/or suicide attempts\u0014\n\u0014\nThe course of a depressive episode may vary from person to person. \nSymptoms may develop over a period of days or weeks, or they may \noccur suddenly, without warning. Sudden onset of this condition can \nbe caused by external factors, including stress, death of a family \nmember, or divorce. Duration of an episode will vary and depends on \nthe medical treatment employed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSCHIZOPHRENIA\u0014\nSchizophrenia is a serious brain disorder. It is a disease that makes \nit difficult for a person to tell the difference between real and \nunreal experiences, to think logically, and to have normal emotional \nresponses to others and to behave normally in social situations. \nPeople with schizophrenia may have difficulty in remembering, talking \nand behaving appropriately.\u0014\nSchizophrenia is not a split personality. It is also not caused by \nbad upbringing, personal weakness or laziness. Schizophrenia is a \ndisease with a physical cause, like cancer or heart disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nPOSITIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDisordered Thinking: Thoughts jump between completely unrelated \ntopics or may be blocked. The person may talk nonsense, make up \nwords or replace words with sounds and rhymes.\u0014\n\tDelusions: False beliefs or thoughts with no basis in reality. For \nexample, someone from the house next door is trying to control the \npatient's thoughts or feelings.\u0014\n\tHallucinations: Hearing, seeing or feeling things that are not \nthere. People with schizophrenia may hear voices that comment on \ntheir behavior or give them commands.\u0014\n\u0014\nNEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBlunted (or flat) affect: Lacking awareness of other people's \nfeelings. The person does not show emotions on the face, avoids eye \ncontact and makes few gestures or movements. He or she does not \nrespond with normal conversation when spoken to. In severe cases, the \nperson may become nearly motionless (catatonia).\u0014\n\tAvolition: Lacking energy, spontaneity and initiative.\u0014\n\tAnhedonia: Lacking pleasure or interest in activities that were once \nenjoyable.\u0014\n\tAttention deficit: Difficulty in concentrating.\u0014",

Bradlee Perry\u0014\n                                           Former Chairman, David L. \nBabson & Co.\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor's Note: The following column contains a number of important \npoints on successful long-term investing which Brad Perry and the \nBabson Staff Letter have emphasized over the years. We think many of \nour readers will agree that in today's exuberant, highly volatile\u0014\nstock market, they are points that are well worth repeating. \n(Reprinted with permission from H. Bradlee Perry)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnyone can make money in stocks. All it takes is common sense and a \ndedication to learning the lessons of investment history, analyzing \nthe approaches that have proven to be rewarding and those that have \nfailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople tend to make investing much more complicated than it should \nbe. So they tend to reject common-sense strategies because they look \ntoo simple. But those, by far, are what work best.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                  Seven Ways to Make \nMoney In Stocks\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tInvest in good businesses with superior growth and profitability.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome businesses have much more favorable fundamental characteristics\u0014\nthan others. For example, the market for prescription drugs is \ngrowing rapidly in all parts of the world and isn't subject to \ndeclines during economic recessions. The business is dominated by a \nfew large companies that compete aggressively in research and \ndevelopment, but not with price cutting and other competitive \nexcesses. And the profit margins in pharmaceuticals are high. That is \nwhy this industry has been one of the most rewarding for investors in \nthe past 50 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, demand for automobiles is growing very slowly in all \nadvanced countries. Sales of cars fluctuate widely, depending on \neconomic conditions and the level of interest rates. Competition is \nintense among over a dozen major companies headquartered in various \nparts of the world. Earnings have a roller coaster pattern and the \naverage level of profit margins is low.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese differences explain why the earnings per share (EPS) of leading \ndrug companies have multiplied 45 times in the past 35 years and \ntheir stocks have risen over 80 times, whereas profits of the three \nU.S. car makers have grown just five times in the same period and \ntheir share prices have advanced a mere five times.\u0014\n\u0014\nWould you rather have an investment of $10,000 grow over 35 years to \n$800,000 or $50,000?\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tFocus on high-quality companies, particularly those with strong \ncompetitive positions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory shows that in at least nine cases out of ten, today's leader \nin any established business (that is one beyond the startup phase, \nwhen early leaders do falter) will be tomorrow's leader, and today's \nlaggard will be tomorrow's laggard.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Concentrate on the long term.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the few things we know for certain about the stock market is \nthat in the long term, it rises in close parallel with the growth of \ncorporate earnings and dividends. The same is true of prices of \nindividual stocks. Moreover, the basic characteristics of different \ntypes of industries change very little over long periods of time. The \ngood industries stay good and the bad industries stay bad.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one knows exactly what the earnings of Cisco and Lucent will be \nnext year, or even the next quarter. But we do know that these are \ntwo of the strongest companies in an industry that has had, and will \ncontinue to have, a favorable long-term growth trend.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasing one's decision on such facts will be a lot more profitable \nthan trying to guess the short-term swings in those companies' \nquarterly earnings and stock prices, and buying their shares on the \nbasis of those guesses.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.\tBe willing to go against the consensus.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething else we know for certain about the stock market is that it \nfluctuates, at times very sharply in reflection of changing investor \nmoods.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen people are unhappy with a good company because it has just \nprovided some sort of disappointment, those who have the courage of \ntheir convictions about the company's long-term prospects will make a \ngreat purchase. This was certainly true of those who bought \nHewlett-Packard at the end of October\u0014\n it's risen 55 percent since then.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen bank stocks were in the doghouse with investors during the \nsummer of 1990 at the peak of worry about huge\u0014\nlosses on real estate loans, the shares of NationsBank (now Bank of \nAmerica) dropped 70 percent and most people were scared of the stock. \nThose who had the courage and foresight to buy NationsBank then have \nmultiplied their capital six and a half times.\u0014\n\u0014\n5.\tPay close attention to valuation.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory shows that even the best companies can become overvalued and \nbe poor investments for a long time, despite continued good growth in \nearnings and dividends.\u0014\n\u0014\nA classic example is Coca-Cola. Investors who bought that stock at \nits peak valuation of 42 times earnings in 1973 had a loss on their \ninvestment for 13 long years, even though the company's earnings and \ndividends tripled between 1973 and 1986.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it's essential to buy growth at reasonable prices.\u0014\n\u0014\n6.\tDiversify.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is important, not only to protect a portfolio against the impact \nof the occasional big loser, but also to increase the opportunities \nto come up with real winners. The offensive aspect of diversification \nis just as important as the defensive one; spread your bets in \nseeking winners.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1999 many investors had a hard time keeping up with the gain in \nthe market averages because they did not have a big enough stake in \nthe three strongest sectors of the market: technology, which soared \nan incredible 65 percent; consumer cyclicals, which rose 20 percent; \nand energy, which was up 16 percent, surprising the many investors \nwho had written off that tired, old industry.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther investors suffered because they had too great a concentration \nin the health care field, a big winner in 1995-1998, but a temporary \nlaggard in the past year.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, either overemphasizing 1999's strongest sectors or retreating \nfrom health care could well prove to be a mistake.\u0014\n\u0014\n7.\tHave realistic expectations.\u0014\n\u0014\nVery few companies can sustain earnings and dividend growth and share \nprice appreciation of better than 10 percent annually over long time \nspans. A few, like Wal-Mart and Pfizer, are able to do this, but many \nmore companies are shooting stars. They experience a few years, maybe \neven a decade, of spectacular growth. And then it's back to the \nreality of single-digit earnings and dividend gains.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe average company, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 stock \nindex, has increased its earnings per share at 7 percent annually \nover the past three decades. Therefore, a firm\u0014\nthat does 40 percent better than the average is able to grow at 10 \npercent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's a very good long-term rate of growth. Compounding at 'just 10 \npercent annually doubles one's money in seven years, quadruples it in \n15 years, and multiplies it eight times in 20 years. Such growth of \ncapital will provide a very comfortable retirement for anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                      Seven Ways to \nLose Money In Stocks\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tBuy the most popular stocks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the easiest way to lose your shirt in the stock market. Many \ninvestors feel they have to hit a rapid series of home runs with the \nbases loaded in order to achieve favorable results. That's nonsense. \nIn fact, everyone who goes chasing after the next Cisco or the \nnext Intel usually ends up with plenty of tax losses every April 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason is simple. Highly popular stocks are always the ones whose \nearnings are growing most rapidly at the moment. And, in nine cases \nout of ten, such success attracts competition, so both earnings \ngrowth and profit margins soon shrink. Then the extremely high \nprice-earnings ratio on the stock plummets. This happened to Wang \nLaboratories when it was king of the hill in word processors, to \nDigital Equipment when it dominated the minicomputer market, to Apple \nComputer when it was the number one PC producer, and to Snapple when \nit was the undisputed leader in iced-tea and fruit-flavored drinks.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tTry to time the market.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a variety of reasons, mostly related to the great power of the \nmarket's long-term uptrend, market timers almost inevitably make \ncostly mistakes from which they can never fully recover. All of the \nlate 1 990s' bears are now in such a deep hole.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudies show that even sophisticated professionals who try to time \nthe market, on average have long-term returns that are one-quarter \nless than those of people who just buy good stocks and hold them \nthrough thick and thin, weeding out a few underachievers as they go \nalong. A difference of one-quarter in average annual return may not \nseem huge, but if you compound a 25 percent differential in return \nover 25 years, you end up with 45 percent less money.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tRide the strong upsurges in cyclical stocks.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people think they can do well trying to catch the wave of \nrising prices for cyclical stocks, such as those of automobile, \nchemical, paper and steel companies. This is extremely hard to do \nsuccessfully, because the stocks tend to start upward when earnings \nare still very depressed and no upturn is in sight. Furthermore, \ncyclical stocks peak out early, while their earnings are still rising \nand the economic picture is bright.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll you have to do is be just a little early, or just a little late, \non cyclicals and you lose all the advantage of their occasional \nstrong advances, which are usually short-lived.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.\tBecome mesmerized by yield.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven a choice between two stocks that look similar on the surface, \ninvestors who need significant current income from their stock \nportfolios often favor the one with the higher dividend yield. This \nhas proven costly in most areas, including the electric utility field.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuke Energy, for example, has long been recognized as an outstanding \npower company. Its dividend yield has always been lower than that of \nmost other electric companies, but Duke's earnings and dividends have \ngrown quite consistently while a series of adverse changes in the \nindustry has caused most electric utilities to experience flat or \ndeclining earnings and dividends.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the investor who five years ago bought Commonwealth Edison, now \ncalled Unicom, with its 7 percent dividend yield, instead of Duke, \nwhich yielded just 5 percent, has suffered grievously. Unicom has cut \nits dividend 47 percent and its stock price has declined 20 percent. \nDuke, meanwhile, has raised its dividend, through annual increases, a \ntotal of 30 percent. And its stock price has jumped 45 percent, \nmaking it a far better income stock.\u0014\n\u0014\n5.\tInvest in weak competitors in hopes they will get strong.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the business world, the rich tend to get richer, and the poor \nusually stay poor. For most of the 20th century, while General \nElectric and Westinghouse were primarily makers of electrical \nequipment, Westinghouse was always a distant second. It continued to \nlag way behind GE right up to the time\u0014\nit shucked off all its traditional businesses to evolve into solely a \nbroadcasting company (now merged with CBS). Similarly, the growth and \nprofitability of Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices have \nconsistently run behind those of Intel.\u0014\n\u0014\n6.\tBuy stocks on tips.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuying a stock without researching the idea and understanding the \ncompany involved is almost a sure recipe for disaster. Ignorance, in \nthis case, is usually not bliss.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Believe the notion that this time it's different.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne example of this is the belief that baby boomers, now investing \nfor retirement, will keep pouring money into stock mutual funds \nwithout interruption over the next 10 years, preventing a bear \nmarket. This is proving erroneous. In fact, the boomers already have \nshown signs of pulling back during the market's brief sinking spells \nin 1998 and 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother failure on the this time it's different syndrome was the \nwidespread belief in the mid-1990s that Asian countries had found a \nway to keep breakneck economic growth, financed by huge borrowing, \ngoing indefinitely without any interruption. That, of course, came a \ncropper in 1997 when the rubber band got stretched too far.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most successful investors are realistic optimists. They are \nrealistic about the inherent weaknesses of mediocre and poor \nbusinesses, the volatility of the stock market, and especially about \nthe wide fluctuations in investor psychology. And they are realistic \nabout their inability to forecast market swings. Such realism appears \nto be in short supply these days.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, successful investors are consistently optimistic \nabout the long-term growth potential of strong companies in favorably \nsituated industries and the stocks of those companies.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaken together, these characteristics make them cautious and careful, \nbut not nervous, in the upper reaches of bull markets  and smart, \neager buyers in the depths of bear markets.\u0014",

    "title": "SETTING CAPTIVES FREE",
    "words": "Setting Captives Free\u0014\n                  It takes more than getting a woman inmate out of \njail to turn her life around\u0014\nBy Jody Veenker \u0014\n\u0014\n Ellen Carter has a dark, smooth complexion that enhances two \nstraight rows of pearly teeth, and her smile could light up a \ndungeon. Weekly, it lights up a jail. \u0014\n\u0014\nOften mistaken for a 30-year-old, this grandmother of eight is \nstriding back and forth across the tan and chocolate-colored tiles in \nthe chapel room at Cook County (Ill.) Jail. \u0014\n\u0014\nCarter paces emphatically through rows of rough-hewn benches, \ndemanding the attention of 100 women in steely blue scrubs. As a \nprison preacher, and soon-to-be director of the first Koinonia House \naftercare program for women, Carter exemplifies the trends and \nstruggles of prison ministry to the ever-increasing female population \nof American prisons. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe incarceration rate for women in the U.S. has climbed 516 percent \nsince 1980, and now Christian prison ministries (which traditionally \nhave focused on men, the overwhelming majority of prisoners in \nAmerica) are running to catch up with the alarming growth. \u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 1985 and 1995 the number of women in prison almost tripled \nfrom 40,000 to 115,000. Currently 130,000 women are behind bars. \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen-To-Women Ministry\u0014\n\u0014\nTo combat these numbers, Carter and hundreds of women like her are \nredefining prison ministry, so that it includes more women ministers, \na deeper level of discipleship, and aftercare that supports women as \nthey try to reconnect with their families and communities. \u0014\n\u0014\nIdeas about how to best help female offenders are changing. Richard \nBundy, director of the Billy Graham Centers Institute for Prison \nMinistry at Wheaton (Ill.) College, says womens prison ministries \nare independently developing three similar characteristics: Many \nwomens ministries are being restructured to focus on one-on-one \ndiscipleship. Many are also developing aftercare opportunities to \nhelp released inmates back into their communities. And the majority \nof ministries are led by women. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the past Ive sensed that many women didnt feel they had a place \nin prison ministry,\" says Bundy, \"but now that women are being \nencouraged to preach and teach other women, you see women from the \nlocal church level getting involved in a really personal way.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nVirginia Hutto, founder of the Womens Criminal Justice Network \nMinistry in Gatesville, Texas, matches female in mates with church \nmentors from across the state. Individual discipleship not only \nallows the women to ground their beliefs in biblical truth, but also \nteaches them to value relationships with other Christians. That will \nmake them more likely to continue in their faith and join a church \nafter they leave prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nTanya Cartwright says New Faith Baptist Church in Madison, Illinois, \nhas experienced the fruit of such discipling relationships. \"We put \non worship services, Bible classes, and counsel inmates \nindividually,\" Cartwright says. \"You see Gods grace when people \naccept Christ, get off of drugs, and start building relationships \nwith their children from prison. But when they get out of prison and \nthey are still attending our church and you see them bringing their \nchildren, you just have to say Wow.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Womens Criminal Justice Net work is also helping local churches \ndevelop programs for prisoners moving back into their communities. \nBuckner Baptist Benevolences in Dallas sponsors the equip program \n(Enhancing Quality and Understanding in Incarcerated Parents). In \nconjunction with a shelter where women live for six months while they \nfind work, equip helps women restore relationships with their \nchildren. In the past two years, 200 women have obtained stable jobs. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Kids are often the one thing a mother cares enough about to change \nher life for,\" says Elizabeth Friar Williams, author of a journal \narticle, \"Fostering the Mother-Child Bond in a Correctional Setting.\" \nBe cause of the success in secular family visitation programs, the \nNational Advisory Com mission on Criminal Justice urges prison \nauthorities to encourage family visits. Prison officials can help by \nproviding transportation from public train and bus depots and \nproviding semi-private surroundings conducive to strengthening family \nties. \u0014\n\u0014\nDanny Franklin knows the benefits of family prison visitation \nfirsthand. A former inmate, Franklin now spends every Saturday \ndriving a rickety church bus from Gospel Wake Covenant Church in \nChicago to Dwight Prison downstate. Between 70 and 80 percent of his \npassengers bring children to visit their incarcerated mothers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I was in prison I saw how hopeless people turned to bad stuff \nlike prison gangs and drugs when they felt like nobody cared about \nthem,\" Franklin says. \"I know it makes a difference and gives you \nhope, just like knowing Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin is praying for money to buy a used van so his ministry can \ncontinue. \u0014\n\"These families are so grateful and patient,\" Franklin says. \n\"Sometimes when I have to cancel because the bus is broken they \nencourage me!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMany larger national prison ministries are looking at successful \nsecular programs like Girl Scouts Behind Bars and discussing new \nforms of prison ministry. Twice a month in seven states mothers and \ndaughters attend a Girl Scout troop meeting together within the jail. \nMothers also spend supervised time working on troop projects with \ntheir daughters. They do science activities, make crafts, and discuss \nself-esteem topics including drug education and sexuality. \u0014\n\u0014\nPrison Fellowship, one of the largest and most respected national \nprison ministries to both men and women, now has a three-member team \nresearching how it can develop national networks such as the Angel \nTree outreach at Christmas, which provides toys to prisoners \nchildren. Another Prison Fellowship goal is to help local churches \nalready involved in prison outreach to develop aftercare support \nprograms. \u0014\n\u0014\nMission to the Americas hopes to help develop an aftercare program \nfor women in Illinois. \u0014\n\u0014\nReuniting Families\u0014\n\u0014\nEllen Carter will open the first Koinonia House for women in July \n2000 in the Fox River Valley. Carter, husband Al, and grandson Delon \nwill offer job support, discipleship, food, shelter, and a sense of \nfamily to six women at a time. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our ultimate aim is to reunite families,\" Carter says, \"but you \ncant take a woman straight out of prison, throw her back into the \nsame environment that put her there, and expect her to care for \nherself and her children.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCarter says the Koinonia House will accept women who realize they \nneed to rebuild their lives before they reunite with their children. \n\"We are a place for people who are willing to work hard to get their \nlives on track so that they can give their kids what they deserve: a \nloving, responsible parent.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile prison-ministry veterans see the trend toward aftercare as hope \nfor breaking cycles of recidivism and restoring families, they also \nagree it is not enough. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is wrong that we are not dealing with the causal factors that \nthese women face,\" says Bundy of the Institute for Prison Ministry. \n\"For the most part they are not violent offenders. They are addicts. \nThey have not graduated from high school, and they have been \noppressed in abusive relationships.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n'Bundy believes Christian community outreach should have a better \nbalance in meeting both the spiritual and physical needs of women. \n\"Because of the gospel, there is a lot of love and hope in the \nchurch. The church has a lot to offer to poor, desperate people whose \nlives are so dark they try to escape with drugs.\" \u0014\nCarter believes that her Koinonia House is just the next step in \nprison ministry today. \"I hope to teach and disciple these women that \na part of knowing Christ is passing along the knowledge of that \nblessing to others. The women whose lives we change should go out and \nhelp others change, too.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDiscipling Women\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Carter works inside a prison, she is unyielding in her attempts \nto get women inmates to rethink their own lives. During a recent \nBible study at the Cook County Jail, she had the full attention of \nnearly 100 inmates. \"I came today to ask you,\" Carter intones, \"How \nclean is your garden? After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, God \ncleaned out his garden. Some of you are messing around with \nhomosexuality, with drugs, with prostitution and vileness. Some of \nyou are sleeping with men who are not your husbands.\" Carter smooths \nher vest, which has bunched from the vigorous, sweeping motions of \nher silk-shirted arms, and leans forward to her audience of yearning \nfaces. \"How clean is your garden?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen shift uncomfortably in the pews, scuffing their feet. As their \nonly outward sign of individuality, women prisoners sport everything \nfrom pink cloth slippers and brand-name running shoes to stylish \nsandals. Carter pauses to let the question sink in. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen in the front row, inmate Gayle Brown bursts into tears. Gayle \nBrowns circumstances and sorrows are not very different from those \nof other incarcerated women in the U.S. Brown, a 38-year-old mother \nof three, does not want to live another day separated from her \nfamily, but she is afraid that even after her release her newfound \nfaith will not be enough to patch up the pieces of their tattered \nlives. \u0014\n\u0014\nA 1998 study by the U.S. Department of Justice found that women \noffenders have different needs than men because women are more \nfrequently victims of sexual or physical abuse and more women carry \nresponsibility for children. \"They also are more likely to be \naddicted to drugs and to have mental illnesses,\" the report says. \nBrown does not often talk about her failed marriage or the affair she \nhad, which contributed to a spiral into drug abuse and ultimately a \nprison sentence. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe has been arrested three times before, but this fourth time is \nespecially painful because, she says, \"I had lived straight for five \nyears. I never planned on seeing this place again.\" Brown became \ninvolved with a man who gave her drugs when she started caring for \nhis sickly mother, a kind neighbor of many years. All she says about \nthe other men in her life is cutting: \"I didnt have a daddy, and \nbesides my husband, I never had a man to take care of me. Men are \nusers through and through.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 70 percent of all female inmates in California were victims \nof ongoing physical abuse before age 18. At least 40 percent of those \nwere sexually abused or assaulted before 18, according to the recent \nreport \"Profiling the Needs of Californias Female Prisons.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPsychologists say that when an abused woman is in prison, she is less \nlikely to report any kind of mistreatment by prison officials. In \naddition, she is more likely to experience terror at the loss of \ncontrol associated with strip searches, group showers, public \ntoilets, and overcrowded prison cells. \u0014\n\u0014\nLike the majority of women in prison, Brown worries constantly about \nher children. According to a 1996 study by Amnesty International, 80 \npercent of incarcerated women are mothers and 75 percent are single \nparents. Browns sons, ages 19 and 16, and her daughter, 13, are \nalways on her mind. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I worry most for my little girl, because I dont think shes going \nto be able to forgive me,\" Brown says. \"My husband left after I \ncommitted adultery and now I am not even around myself.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMeeting Individual Needs\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly 20 percent of incarcerated womens children live with a father \nif their mother is jailed. About 60 percent of dependent children are \nraised by their grandmothers, 15 percent go to foster homes, and 5 \npercent are cared for by other relatives. Browns children are no \nexception. \"They would have no place to go if my mama hadnt stepped \nin.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, many of the children who are separated from their mothers \nduring a prison sentence end up following their moms to jail. U.S. \nNews & World Report polled juvenile-justice agencies in 21 states in \n1999 and found in each state that between 40 and 60 percent of female \njuvenile offenders said their mothers were or had been incarcerated. \u0014\n\u0014\nRemoving children from their only parental influence is so \ndetrimental that in 1993 Congress authorized the National Institute \nof Corrections to allocate $8 million for a facility geared for women \nprisoners and their young children. But in the ensuing six years the \nNIC has failed to spend any money toward such a facility. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough saying her recent arrest for illegal drug possession was not \nlegitimate, Brown admits that her three previous arrests were \ndrug-related as well. More than 70 percent of women in state prisons \nin 1986 abused drugs before admission. In 1991 the U.S. Department of \nJustice found that a third of all female inmates reported committing \ntheir offense while on drugs. One in four female inmates committed \ncrimes to get money for illicit drugs. \u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are also three times more likely than men to enter prison \naddicted to cocaine. Often, like Brown, offenders will do anything to \ndeny they have an addiction for fear of extra years getting tacked on \nto their sentence, or in hopes of obtaining drugs surreptitiously \nwithin the prison system. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you arent on drugs when you come into a place like this one,\" \nBrown says, motioning to the drab walls and dim corridors, \"all this \nwill make you want to start on them.\" Brown also admits depression is \na common problem for inmates. A study by Northwestern University \nbetween 1991 and 1993 found \"substantial psychiatric morbidity\" among \nfemale detainees at the Cook County Jail. Researchers found that many \nwomen inmates suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe rate of recidivism for women who do not receive any type of \ncounseling while imprisoned is significantly higher than the 20 to 30 \npercent rate for the women who do receive some form of support. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbuse, motherhood, drug addiction, and health factors combine to \nfavor ministry tailored to individual needs. When Brown breaks down \nin the middle of Carters chapel sermon, a prison chaplains wife \nembraces her and prays with her. \"It will take something as big and \npowerful as Jesus to change my life,\" Brown says. \"You feel like that \nis possible when someone prays with you and talks about the Bible. I \njust pray that I get the chance to go home and see my kids again.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCultivating New Hope\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of passing on what God teaches is at the heart of Carters \nministry. Carter believes in discipleship because that is what \nchanged her life. Carter was raised by her grandparents in a strict, \nold-fashioned church in a poor neighborhood in Maryland. \"I knew all \nthe stories about Jesus, but I had no idea that I needed to know him \npersonally,\" she recalls. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter struggling to complete high school, she was studying nursing \nwhen she got pregnant at 18. A series of failed relationships and \njobs led her to conclude that she was \"wandering around with an empty \nheart.\" Riding home one day, she spotted clusters of smiling people \npouring out of First Baptist Church of Highland Park, and leaned over \nto tell her daughter that they were going to see that place close up. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Easter Sunday 1986 Carter realized that Christ had died for her \nand that she would have to give her life to him in response. Her \nsecond husband, Alveris Delon Carter Jr., made the same decision a \nyear later. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We were a couple of babes, and we wouldnt have known what to do, \nhow to live, if it wasnt for Michael Durant [a member of First \nBaptist], who discipled my husband and then me.\" Carter originally \nserved in First Baptists prison ministry because her husband was \nhelping men in jail. She was often fearful and hated public speaking. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I almost fainted, I mean, I was on the point of tears one evening \nwhen they asked me to read the Scripture for the sermon out loud,\" \nCarter says. \"But I kept getting encouraged to go disciple the women. \nThe very first woman in prison I ever met was named Xena. I will \nnever forget!\" Carter was touched by Xenas plight: she was a single \nparent with four kids and no family member was willing to care for \nthem. Carter determined to pray that Xena would be released to care \nfor her children. She was crushed to discover after four months of \nprayer that Xena had been sentenced to five years in prison and \ntransferred to another facility. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I didnt go back to the prison for six months, I was so devastated,\" \nCarter sighs, \"but God had other ways of working on me. My son, the \napple of my eye, he was arrested and I felt like someone had stabbed \nme. I was like a zombie.\" Carter was so depressed that she would get \nout of bed to go to work but crawl back in as soon as she got home. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter months of her husbands promptings, Carter finally agreed to \nmeet with Deacon Carl Felton, who ran the prison ministry at First \nBaptist, to discuss her anger and pain. Felton took her to visit her \nson in prison and helped her realize that God had a plan to bring \ngood out of her pain and sorrow. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"That was when God first made my dream of a Koinonia House real to \nme,\" Carter says, flashing her blinding grin. \"Its all based on \nJeremiah 29. God says he has plans to give us a future and a hope. \nThat is what the women I see at the jail need to know.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCarters voice glows as she speaks of family picnics, teaching \njob-interview skills, and even cooking with the released prisoners \nshe will disciple. \"We have plenty of women who are willing to visit \nthe jail and help preach the gospel or pray with the inmates,\" Carter \nsays. \"What we need is people who are willing to go beyond that. We \nneed people who will form friendships, who will come alongside them \nand say, I will help you succeed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJody Veenker is Editorial Resident for Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "SUNDAR SINGH'S EXAMPLES OF \"ABIDE IN ME\"",
    "words": "The Disciple,--O Master, Fountain of life! Why dost Thou hide \nThyself from those that adore Thee, and dost not rejoice the eyes of \nthem that long to gaze upon Thee?\u0014\n\u0014\n     The Master,--1. My true child, true happiness depends not upon \nthe sight of the eyes, but comes through spiritual vision, and \ndepends upon the heart. In Palestine thousands looked upon Me, but \nall of them did not thus obtain true happiness. By mortal eyes only \nthose things can be perceived that are mortal, for eyes of flesh \ncannot behold an\u0014\nimmortal God and spiritual beings. For instance, you yourself cannot \nsee your own spirit, therefore how can you behold its Creator? But \nwhen the spiritual eyes are opened, then you can surely see Him who \nis Spirit, (John iv.24), and that which you now see of Me you see not \nwith eyes of flesh, but with the eyes of the spirit.\u0014\n     \u0014\n       If, as you say, thousands of people saw Me in Palestine then \nwere all their spiritual eyes opened, or did I Myself become mortal? \nThe answer is, No! I took on a mortal body so that in it I might give \na ransom for the sins of the world; and when the work of salvation \nwas completed for sinners (John xix.30), then that which was immortal \ntransfigured what was mortal into glory. Therefore after the \nresurrection only those were able to see Me who had received spiritual\u0014\nsight (Acts x. 40,41).\u0014\n\u0014\n     2. Many there are in this world who know about Me, but do not \nknow Me; that is they have no personal relationship with Me, \ntherefore they have no true apprehension of or faith in Me, and do \nnot accept Me as their Saviour and Lord.\u0014\n     \u0014\n      Just as if one talks with a man born blind about different \ncolors such as red, blue, yellow, he remains absolutely unaware of \ntheir charm and beauty, he cannot attach any value to them, because \nhe only knows about them, and is aware of their various names. But \nwith regard to colors he can have no true conception until his eyes \nare opened. In the same manner until a man's spiritual eyes are \nopened, howsoever learned he may be, he cannot know Me, he cannot\u0014\nbehold My glory, and he cannot understand that I am God Incarnate.\u0014\n\u0014\n     3. There are many believers who are aware of My presence in \ntheir hearts bringing to them spiritual life and peace, but cannot \nplainly see Me. Just as the eye can see many things, yet when someone \ndrops medicine into the eye does not see it, but the presence of the \nmedicine is felt cleansing the inner eye and promoting the power of \nsight.\u0014\n\u0014\n     4. The true peace which is born of My presence in the hearts of \ntrue believers they are unable to see, but, feeling its power, they \nbecome happy in it. Nor can they see that happiness of mind or heart \nthrough which they enjoy the peace of My presence. It is the same \nwith the tongue and sweetmeats. The faculty of taste which resides in \nthe tongue and the sweetness it perceives are both invisible. Thus \nalso I give My children life and joy by means of the hidden manna,\u0014\nwhich the world with all its wisdom knows not nor can know (Rev. \nii.7).\u0014\n\u0014\n     5. Sometimes during sickness the faculty of taste in the tongue \nis interfered with, and during that time, however tasty the food \ngiven to the sick person may be, it has an ill taste to him. In just \nthe same way sin interferes with the taste for spiritual things. \nUnder such circumstances My Word and service and My presence lost \ntheir attraction to the sinner, and instead of profiting by them he \nbegins to argue about and to criticize them.\u0014\n\u0014\n     6. Many believers again--like the man born blind, on receiving \nhis sight--are able to see Jesus as a prophet and the Son of Man, but \ndo not regard Him as the Christ and the Son of God (John ix.17, \n35-37), until I am revealed to them a second time in power.\u0014\n\u0014\n     7. A mother once hid herself in a garden amongst some densely \ngrowing shrubs, and her little son went in search of her here and \nthere, crying as he went. Through the whole garden he went, but could \nnot find her. A servant said to him, \"Sonny, don't cry! Look at the \nmangoes on this tree and all the pretty, pretty flowers in the \ngarden. Come, I am going to get some for you.\" But the child cried \nout, \"No! No! I want my mother. The food she gives me is nicer than \nall the\u0014\nmangoes, and her love is sweeter far than all these flowers, and \nindeed you know that all this garden is mine, for all that my mother \nhas is mine. No! I want my mother!\" When the mother, hidden in the \nbushes, heard this, she rushed out and, snatching her child to her \nbreast, smothered him with kisses, and that garden became a paradise \nto the child. In this way\u0014\nMy children cannot find in this great garden of a world, so full of \ncharming and beautiful things, any true joy until they find Me. I am \ntheir Emmanuel, who is ever with them, and I make Myself known to \nthem (John xiv.21).\u0014\n\u0014\n     8. Just as the sponge lies in the water, and the water fills the \nsponge, but the water is not the sponge and the sponge is not the \nwater, but they ever remain different things, so children abide in Me \nand I in them. This is not pantheism, but it is the kingdom of God, \nwhich is set up in the hearts of those who abide in this world; and \njust as the water in the sponge,\u0014\nI am in every place and in everything, but they are not I (Luke \nxvii.21).\u0014\n\u0014\n     9. Take a piece of charcoal, and however much you may wash it \nits blackness will not disappear, but let the fire enter into it and \nits dark colour vanishes. So also when the sinner receives the Holy \nSpirit (who is from the Father and Myself, for the Father and I are \none), which is the baptism of fire, all the blackness of sin is \ndriven away, and he is made a light to the world (Matt. iii.11, \nv.14). As the fire in the charcoal, so I abide in My children and \nthey in Me, and\u0014\nthrough them I make Myself manifest to the world.\u0014",

    "words": "Seared Conscience\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring my college yearsin my infinite wisdomit occurred to me that \nit made no sense to stop at red traffic lights when there was clearly \nno traffic around. So I began to stop only brieflyjust long enough \nto check for carsand then proceed. My stops became shorter and \nshorter, and eventually I no longer stopped at all. I simply checked \nout the landscape well in advance andif no cars were \ncomingproceeded full speed through the red light. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne day something changed all of that, and I've never run a red light \nsince. I was approaching an isolated light in an area where there was \nrarely traffic in the busiest of times. I had already checked out the \nlandscape and was near the empty intersection when a car topped the \nhill to my left. It was too far away to pose any threat, but it did \npose a problem: it was a police car. But that is not what changed my \nways, because I got the car stopped and received no more punishment \nthan a dirty glance. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat scared me enough to put an end to that practice was what \noccurred in the split seconds between spotting the patrol car and \ngetting the car stopped. In that instant, my foot moved from the gas \npedal to the brake pedal, and then back to the gas pedal! I did not \nwill it to do that; my foot just did it. My foot did that because \nthat is how I had trained my mind to respond. I had continually \nignored what had once been a clear signal to stopa red lightand as \na result that signal was no longer clear. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe same occurs with sin. Our God-given conscience gives us warning \nsignals, and we can heed those signals or ignore them. If we ignore \nthem often enough, we may eventually fail to recognize them as \nsignals at all.\u0014\nCitation: J. Douglas Burford, Mission, Kansas\u0014",

    "title": "SUICIDE--IS IT PREVENTABLE?",
    "words": "Suicide\u0014\nA Preventable Tragedy?\u0014\nA ministry helps churches handle the complex issue. by PERI \nSTONE-PALMQUIST\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE PASTOR seemed to do everything right. He listened actively, \nprovided emotional support, and counseled the depressed woman for an \nentire year.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut she took her own life anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a time for the church to use its greatest strengths. But like \nthe pastor, some members of the church didn't know precisely how to \nrespond or help survivors. At the wake, one member approached the \ngrieving daughter. She told me my mother was in hell, Stephanie \nWeber says. Although the remark was made more than 20 years ago, \nWeber says, I can remember feeling so numb.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Weber discovered the hard way, many Christians do not know how to \nrespond to a suicide, and sometimes they inadvertently do more harm \nthan good. Weber and others are helping to change that through \nSuicide Prevention Services (sPs), one of the few advocacy \norganizations in the nation that deals with suicide prevention, \nintervention, and post-suicide\u0014\nassistance for victims' families.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith their strong social support, life-affirming values, and love, \nChristians are in a unique position to fight a largely preventable \nproblem identified as the eighth-leading cause of death in the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBEYOND STAGGERING STATISTICS\u0014\nIn 1998 suicide accounted for more than 29,000 deaths, compared to \nfewer than 19,000 from homicide and about 13,000 from AIDS, Church in \nAction\taccording to National Vital Statistics Reports. Even more \nastonishing is the number of Americans who attempt suicide each year \nbut survivemore than half a million. These staggering statistics \nprompted Surgeon General David Satcher to develop a national \nsuicide-prevention strategy. Last summer he released a Call to \nAction to Prevent Suicide, which included 15 recommendations to \nincrease awareness, step up research, and encourage intervention. In \nthose recommendations, Satcher identified church and synagogue \nleaders as natural community helpers on the issue. SPS has found a \nwelcome niche within the church, recruiting and training pastors and \nlay leaders to counsel and educate their own congregations. SPS also \nencourages helping larger communities, whether by volunteering with a \ncrisis phone line or helping counsel walk-ins at a crisis center.\u0014\nBased in Batavia, Ill., sps focuses its efforts on Kane and Kendall \ncounties in the far western suburbs of Chicago, but the ministry \nhopes its urgent message will eventually reach a nationwide audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastors and congregations often do not have the resources or \nknowledge necessary to deal with such a complex and sensitive issue. \nSPS wants to change that. SPS already has succeeded with Wayne \nMiller, pastor at St. Mark's Lutheran Church in Aurora, Ill., and an \nSPS board member. He's one of about 15 pastors directly involved with \nSPS. They gave me\u0014\n\u0014\n[For a 1987 CT treatment of the moral status of suicides, see \nSuicide and the Silence of Scripture at \nwww.christianitytoday.com/Suicide.]\u0014\n\u0014\na way to enter into the process constructively, Miller says. I \ndidn't have that before. I almost always felt helpless.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral people in Miller's church attempted suicide in 1998. But only \none person under Miller's care succeeded. The impact was huge, he \nsaid. Not like it was my fault, but it kicked up questions. Could I \nhave done something different?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen SPS formed, Miller became involved and learned what resources \nwere available and what steps to take when dealing with a suicidal \nperson.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastors, family, and friends may not realize how easily counselors \ncan be overwhelmed when dealing with a person contemplating suicide. \nMiller learned that pastors should neither remove themselves \ncompletely from the situation nor try to go it alone. There's a lot \nof people in different disciplines who try to be helpful, and we all \nhave part of the story, he says. But none of us has the whole \nstory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church is important, and even when pastors refer a suicidal \nperson elsewhere, the person will often come back to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain groups, including teenagers, white males, and the elderly, \nare at higher statistical risk for suicide. The National Center for \nInjury Prevention and Control rates suicide as the third-leading \ncause of death in the age bracket of 15 to 24. People younger than 25 \naccounted for 15 percent of all suicides in 1997.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhite males accounted for 72 percent. In fact, males are actually \nfour times as likely to die from suicide than females but females \nare more likely to attempt suicide. In both males and females, \nsuicide rates increase with age and are highest among Americans age \n65 and older.\u0014\nNevertheless, suicide affects people of all races, ages, and walks of \nlife. The factors leading to suicide are variedundiagnosed \ndepression, feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness and loneliness, \nalcohol or substance abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen early warning signs appear, churches are in a unique position to \nconnect people with people. Signs that should be taken seriously \ninclude withdrawal from friends and once-enjoyable activities, \npersistent sadness and hopelessness, indecision, lack of \nconcentration, poor self-esteem, anger, and rage. When a person \nexhibits such behavior, church members do well to approach the \ndepressed person and offer supportive commentsI'm praying for you. \nI know this must be a hard time for you.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who are suicidal are great actors, Weber says. If they \ndon't want a pastor to know, it's out of your hands. But if you pick \nup on the signs, invite them in and listen. Let them talk about thefr \npain.\u0014\n\u0014\nSPS teaches a specific response called Question, Persuade, and Refer. \nThe first\u0014\nstep: You ask people very specific questions about how they're \nfeeling, what they're thinking, Miller says. You can't plant the \nidea of suicideif it's there, it's there. But you cut through the \nshame when you talk about it. Miller asks questions like Are you \nconsidering suicide? and Do you think about it a lot? How often?\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, persuade the person to get helpto make another plan amid \ndepression, to go to an emergency room or call in family members, \ndepending on he severity of the situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, refer the person to available esourcesa local crisis line, a \nmedical ,rofessional, or support groups. Weber also recommends \naccompanyng the depressed person to the first coun;eling session. \nSay, 'I'll pick you up and :ake you,' she says. Follow-up is key, \nand not just with hose considering suicide. Survivors also ~ieed \ncontinued support, which sps board ~nember Barb Stidwell knows all \ntoo Kell. Her 16-year-old daughter, Meg, :ommitted suicide in the \nsummer of [995. Stidwell says she could never have mdured this \nexperience without God md her church. I've only seen that kind )f \nlove in Christians, that long-term sup)ort, she says. At work, for \ninstance, eople were acting like I should move on ilx months later.\u0014\n\u0014\nINSTEAD OF FLOWERS\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Stidwell, like Weber, also saw the mwkwardness of many \nChristians' respons~s to suicide. We'd have people over for dinner \nwho wouldn't even acknowledge that my daughter died, she says. \nStidwell also discovered that many people simply do not know what to \nsay. As a Christian, you don't have to have the right words, she \nsays. Just say, 'I'm sorry, that's a terrible tragedy.' We need to \nget to the point where people understand the sorrow without being \njudgmental.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost congregations have not wrestled with issues surrounding suicide \nand, Weber says, their members may believe that suicide is an \nunforgivable sin. When Stidwell visits churches, she often presents \nseveral questions for discussion:\u0014\n\u0014\n How can we as a church discourage suicide and still support, without \ncondemnation, those whose loved ones have committed suicide?\u0014\n How can we encourage our congregation to support isolated and \ndepressed people among us?\u0014\n How can we reduce the stigma of suicide (in order to encourage open \ndiscussion) while still emphasizing the fallout of suicide on \nfamilies and friends (in order to discourage suicide attempts)?\u0014\n\u0014\nGary McCann, pastor at the New England Congregational Church in \nAurora, Ill., has posed questions like these to his congregation. We \nmust provide a community where everyone is included and accepted, he \nsays.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcCann helped organize a Suicide Prevention Sunday to help bring \nattention to the issue. The church displayed a quilt featuring \npictures of people who have committed suicide. Whenever it becomes \npersonal, people start to deal with it, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Suicide Prevention Sunday service, church member Nancy \nHopp told the moving story of how her brother's suicide changed her \nforever. Hopp encourages Christians not only to focus on suicide \nprevention, but also to cultivate full relationships with loved ones. \nHer brother wrote his own obituary in advance, advising others: Take \nsomeone you know out to lunch this week and tell them how much you \nlove them. ~\u0014\n\u0014\nPen Stone-Palmquist attends St. Martin's\u0014\nLutheran Church in Austin, Texas.\u0014",

According to the Suicide \nPrevention\u0014\n                       Advocacy Network (SPAN), the suicide rate \namong 15 to\u0014\n                       19 year olds has quadrupled in the last 40 \nyears, making it\u0014\n                       the third leading cause of death in this age \ngroup today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Yet what these statistics dont take into \naccount are the\u0014\n                       living victims of suicide--family members and \nfriends left\u0014\n                       behind to grapple with their inability to \nprevent such a\u0014\n                       self-destructive act.

After all, I\u0014\n                  thought Id fully recovered from my 18-year-old \nbrother Barts suicide. Id\u0014\n                  bought the vacuum from Bart 6 months before he \nkilled himself in May,\u0014\n                  1988. As a newlywed at the time, I could barely \nafford the expensive\u0014\n                  appliance, but I knew no one else in my family \nwould buy one from him. I\u0014\n                  suddenly realized why I couldnt bear to throw it \naway; its purchase\u0014\n                  symbolized my love for Bart. Through the years, \nthat vacuum had relieved\u0014\n                  me of the one thought that used to terrify me: \nCould I have prevented Bart\u0014\n                  from committing suicide? \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Its a futile question, because even today I still \ndont understand what made\u0014\n                  Bart take his life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  GROWING UP, BART trailed me, and I loved it! He was \nseven years younger\u0014\n                  than I, and had a different father. Since our \nmother was on her fourth\u0014\n                  marriage, our loyalty to each other was our \nsecurity. Bart attended my\u0014\n                  high-school football games where I was a \ncheerleader, just to watch me\u0014\n                  cheer. He kept special gold medals I earned from \nrunning track. When I\u0014\n                  was a lifeguard at the town pool, Bart sat by my \nchair, enjoying my Coke.\u0014\n                  His shadowing me filled a void all my achievements \ncouldnt. I depended on\u0014\n                  Bart--and he depended on me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Barts charming personality and chiseled good looks \nmade him appear to be\u0014\n                  a healthy boy--and sometimes, he was. But other \ntimes, he was detached.\u0014\n                  He didnt seem to have any close friends; he never \nmade good grades, and\u0014\n                  rarely experienced success. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  At 18, when I left for college, I felt as though I \nwere abandoning my own\u0014\n                  son. I glanced in my rearview mirror to see Bart \npedaling his bike as fast as\u0014\n                  he could, yelling out, \"Please hurry home, Suz. Im \ngonna miss you!\" It took\u0014\n                  everything I had not to turn around and take my \n11-year-old brother with\u0014\n                  me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  When our mother remarried again, they left the \nstate, so I didnt see much of\u0014\n                  Bart during his high-school years. But when I was \n22 and Bart was in the\u0014\n                  10th grade, I learned of his first suicide attempt. \nAfterwards, Bart was\u0014\n                  diagnosed with manic depression, something he never \nliked to admit he\u0014\n                  suffered from. While Bart sporadically took \nmedication for his depression, at\u0014\n                  other times, he insisted he was perfectly normal. \nUnfortunately, Barts\u0014\n                  disorder dug deeper than my ability to comprehend \nor cure. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  IT WASN'T UNTIL I got married at 24, during Barts \n17th summer, that our\u0014\n                  relationship rekindled. I lavishly praised him for \nreceiving his GED despite\u0014\n                  quitting high school, and landing a job selling \nvacuums. He often spent the\u0014\n                  weekends with my husband, Ken, and me at our condo. \nAlthough Bart lived\u0014\n                  with our mom seven hours away, we relished spending \nweekends together. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  One unexpected visit, however, concerned me. His \ncar broke down near\u0014\n                  my house. He called me, needing a place to stay. \nWhen I picked him up,\u0014\n                  Bart seemed different. He looked edgy. He flew into \na rage because his car\u0014\n                  would take two days to fix, then paced for hours in \nfrustration. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Mom had told me she suspected he was into drugs. \nConcerned, I sat Bart\u0014\n                  down and said, \"I love you, and Im here for you. \nMoms told me youre\u0014\n                  into cocaine, and Im worried!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Oh, Suz,\" he replied, his nose crinkling, \"you \nknow Mom and her\u0014\n                  exaggerations. Im fine. She isnt telling me what \nto do, and it makes her\u0014\n                  mad.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I couldnt deny our mother loved to control her \nchildren, so I believed him.\u0014\n                  Still, when he drove off the next day, I had the \nfleeting thought, Ill never\u0014\n                  see him again. I ignored the impulse to chase him \nas I raced to get to work\u0014\n                  on time. How could I know this feeling was \nprophetic? \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Two days later, my stepfather called. Barts body \nand numerous drugs had\u0014\n                  been found in his car, along with a bizarre \ncassette in a tape recorder. With\u0014\n                  loud heavy metal music in the background, Bart had \ntaped a slurred diatribe\u0014\n                  about wanting to find out what death felt like. \nThen the cassette abruptly\u0014\n                  stopped. Bart took his life by carbon monoxide \npoisoning two days before\u0014\n                  his 19th birthday; Id been the last person to see \nhim alive. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  AFTER I HEARD THE NEWS of Barts death, I clung to \nmy belief in God like a\u0014\n                  drowning man clutches a life preserver. Even after \nI stopped crying\u0014\n                  outwardly, inwardly I felt shame and guilt. Bart \nhad always needed me.\u0014\n                  Should I have found a psychiatrist for him? Should \nI have insisted on\u0014\n                  therapy? How could this catastrophe have been \nprevented? And oh, how I\u0014\n                  missed my baby brother! \u0014\n\u0014\n                                   Bart's disorder dug deeper\u0014\n                                       than my ability to\u0014\n                                     comprehend or cure. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I knew I needed to appropriate Gods strength in \nthis tragedy--but how?\u0014\n                  Numb, I trudged to church, hoping to sing a \ncomforting song. Obediently I\u0014\n                  taught Sunday school, frantically praying to find a \ncalming Scripture. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  While Ken and my friends were supportive, as time \nwent by, they expected\u0014\n                  healing--but the opposite occurred. I felt \nsuffocated by the weight of grief,\u0014\n                  shame, and loss. The \"old Suzy\"--fun-loving, \norganized, hopeful--had all but\u0014\n                  vanished. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Working hard at my sales job provided limited \nrelief during the day, but\u0014\n                  nighttime became my enemy. I had trouble falling \nasleep, and when I did\u0014\n                  doze, I experienced horrific nightmares. In these \nterrifying scenes, I always\u0014\n                  arrived too late to rescue Bart, and powerlessly \nwatched him die. For the\u0014\n                  first time in my highly organized life, I was too \ntired to return a phone call,\u0014\n                  clean my house, or even wash my hair. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Meanwhile, my aunt worried about me. She suggested \nI attend her national\u0014\n                  nondenominational group called Bible Study \nFellowship (BSF). Desperate\u0014\n                  for help, I thought, Why not? \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As I attended the group each week and studied the \nBible each day, I began\u0014\n                  experiencing Gods love in a new, powerful way. \nAlthough Id attended\u0014\n                  church since Id become a Christian, for the first \ntime I really learned how to\u0014\n                  apply Scripture to real-life situations. Then I \nread in Mark 14:8 what Jesus\u0014\n                  said to those who accused the woman who washed his \nfeet with expensive\u0014\n                  perfume: \"She did what she could.\" It was as though \nGod spoke directly to\u0014\n                  me: Suzy, you did what you could. I know how much \nyou loved your\u0014\n                  brother. You couldnt do any more. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gods promises became a balm to my broken heart. \nThey salved the raw,\u0014\n                  deep gash left in my spirit by the loss of my \nbrother. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As I surrendered my memories, once again my tears \nflowed freely. Soon my\u0014\n                  numbness started to give way to a deep sadness, and \nsadness, to a gradual\u0014\n                  release from my grief and guilt. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  ALTHOUGH I'M LEARNING to relinquish responsibility \nfor Barts death, his\u0014\n                  suicide continues to influence my life, especially \nwith my children, Keegan,\u0014\n                  eight, Lauren, six, and Trent, five. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  To this day, I have the hardest time leaving them \nwith babysitters. I\u0014\n                  frequently sense Im saying good-bye to my children \nfor the last time. When\u0014\n                  I tuck them in, I find excuses to return to their \nroom, sometimes four or five\u0014\n                  times. Tonight my daughter, Lauren, finally said, \n\"Mom, Im almost asleep.\u0014\n                  Could you not come back in and talk to me anymore?\" \nI had to laugh. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  When the kids are late coming home with Ken, I \ndread they may be dead. I\u0014\n                  mentally envision how Ill manage without them. I \ncant relax until theyre\u0014\n                  safely back with me. But as I daily admit these \nfears in my life and allow\u0014\n                  God to heal the damage Barts suicide inflicted, my \nanxiety about\u0014\n                  motherhood continues to diminish. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I know Ill never understand why Bart felt the need \nto end his life. His\u0014\n                  suicide almost destroyed me, but I now know the \nonus for his death rests on\u0014\n                  his shoulders. Free choice is a God-given gift. Who \nam I to think I could\u0014\n                  have saved him? Am I God? Can I give and take life? \nOf course not. I\u0014\n                  couldnt even \"save\" myself; Christ did that for \nme. When I get to heaven, I\u0014\n                  know Ill receive the answers. Faith in action is \ndeciding to believe in Gods\u0014\n                  sovereignty. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I do know, however, that I wouldnt have missed the \nspecial bond Bart and\u0014\n                  I shared, regardless of the torment I experienced \nby his demise. I cherish my\u0014\n                  brother Bart. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Tomorrow the kids and I will go shopping. Im \nfinally ready to part with the\u0014\n                  sweeper that kept Barts vivid memory alive. Bart \nwill always hold a tender\u0014\n                  place in my heart, but Gods peace is filling the \nhuge void his death caused in\u0014\n                  my life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As I throw away the worn appliance, Im ready to \nlet go of the\u0014\n                  accountability for my brother, and concentrate on \nGods good gifts--my\u0014\n                  children. Theyll be with me at the store picking \nout our new vacuum. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  SUZY RYAN is a freelance writer living in \nCalifornia.\u0014",

    "title": "SON OR FRIEND?  A QUESTIONABLE STORY!",
    "words": "THIS QUESTIONABLE STORY RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS\u0014\n\u0014\n  After a few of the usual Sunday evening hymns, the church's pastor \u0014\nonce again slowly stood up, walked over to the pulpit, and gave a \u0014\nvery brief introduction of his childhood friend.\u0014\n\u0014\n  With that, an elderly man stepped up to the pulpit to speak, \"A \u0014\nfather, his son, and a friend of his son were sailing off the Pacific \u0014\nCoast,\" he began, \"when a fast approaching storm blocked any attempt \u0014\nto get back to shore.  The waves were so high, that even though the \u0014\nfather was an experienced sailor, he could not keep the boat upright, \u0014\nand the three were swept into the ocean.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  The old man hesitated for a moment, making eye contact with two \u0014\nteenagers who were, for the first time since the service began, \u0014\nlooking somewhat interested in his story.\u0014\n\u0014\n  He continued, \"Grabbing a rescue line, the father had to make the \u0014\nmost excruciating decision of his life....to which boy he would throw \u0014\nthe other end of the line. He only had seconds to make the decision. \u0014\nThe father knew that his son was a Christian, and he also knew that \u0014\nhis son's friend was not. The agony of his decision could not be \u0014\nmatched by the torrent of waves.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As the father yelled out, 'I love you, son!' he threw the line to \u0014\nhis son's friend. By the time he pulled the friend back to the \u0014\ncapsized boat, his son had disappeared beyond the raging swells into \u0014\nthe black of night. His body was never recovered.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  By this time, the two teenagers were sitting straighter in the pew, \u0014\nwaiting for the next words to come out of the old man's mouth.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"The father,\" he continued, \"knew his son would step into eternity \u0014\nwith Jesus, and he could not bear the thought of his son's friend \u0014\nstepping into an eternity without Jesus. Therefore, he sacrificed his \u0014\nson. How great is the love of God that He should do the same for us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  With that, the old man turned and sat back down in his chair as \u0014\nsilence filled the room. Within minutes after the service ended, the \u0014\ntwo teenagers were at the old man's side. \"That was a nice story,\" \u0014\npolitely started one of the boys, \"but I don't think it was very \u0014\nrealistic for a father to give up his son's life in hopes that the \u0014\nother boy would become a Christian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, you've got a point there,\" the old man replied, glancing down \u0014\nat his worn Bible. A big smile broadened his narrow face, and he once \u0014\nagain looked up at the boys and said, \"It sure isn't very realistic, \u0014\nis it?  But I'm standing here today to tell you that THAT story gives \u0014\nme a glimpse of what it must have been like for God to give up His \u0014\nSon for me.  You see.... I was the son's friend.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SUICIDE AND THE SILENCE OF SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "CT Classic: Suicide and the Silence of Scripture\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the church has come to opposing conclusions about the fate of \nvictims, we have a mandate to minister to those left behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Thomas D. Kennedy | posted 7/6/00\u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago one of my better students came by my office for a \nchat. Several times before, she had talked of her troubled past. \nHowever, her faith had showed marked development.\u0014\nBut on this day she announced that she had recently planned for her \nsuicide. I was shocked and confused.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuicide is confusing for Christians. Although the general thrust of \nscripture is clearly opposed to the taking of one's own life, it \nprovides no clear disapproval of the few cases of apparent suicide it \nrecounts. Suicide also confuses us because some of those we believe \nto be strong in the faith have considered it as a \"way out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamson and St. Augustine\u0014\nMust we believe that hose who have taken their own lives suffer the \neternal punishment of God? Nothing in scripture drives us to that \nconclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the seven or so suicides reported in Scripture, most familiar are \nSaul, Samson, and Judas. Saul apparently committed suicide to avoid \ndishonor and suffering at the hands of the Philistines. He is \nrewarded by the Israelites with a war hero's burial, there being no \napparent disapproval of his suicide (1 Sam. 31:1-6). And while there \nis no hero's burial for Judas Iscariot (Matt. 27:5-7), Scripture is \nonce more silent on the morality of this suicide of remorse.\u0014\nThe suicide of Samson has posed a greater problem for Christian \ntheologians. Both Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas wrestled \nwith the case and concluded that Samson's suicide was justified as an \nact of obedience to a direct command of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjections to suicide have a long history in the church. But the idea \nthat suicide is an unforgivable sin is less easily traced. Among the \nchurch fathers, Saint Augustine was the most prominent and \ninfluential opponent of suicide. And early church synods declared \nthat bequests from those who committed suicide (as well as the \noffering of those who attempted suicide) ought not to be accepted; \nand throughout the medieval period, proper Christian burial was \nrefused those who committed suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Thomas Aquinas believed that suicide, by excluding a final \nrepentance, was a mortal sin. Dante is likely to have influenced \nChristian thought at least as much as Saint Thomas, placing those who \ncommitted suicide in the seventh circle of the inferno. Luther and \nCalvin, despite their abhorrence of suicide do not suggest that it is \nan unpardonable sin. John Calvin is perhaps the most helpful on the \nissue, concluding that blaspheming against the Holy Spirit is the \nonly unpardonable sin (Matt.12:31), and suicide need not be viewed as \nblasphemy. The pedigree of the view that suicide is unforgivable \nseems to lie in the medieval church and its distinction \u0014\nbetween mortal and venial sins.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreely Chosen\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must understand suicide as free and uncoerced actions engaged in \nfor the purpose of bringing about one's own death. Once we define it \nthis way, it is easy to grasp the church's clear teaching throughout \nthe centuries that suicide is morally wrong and ought never to be \nconsidered by the Christian. Life is a gift from God. To take one's \nown life is to show insufficient gratitude. Our lives belong to God; \nwe are but stewards. To end my own life is to usurp that the \nprerogative that is God's alone. Suicide, the church has taught, is \nordinarily a rejection of the goodness of God, and it can never be \nright to reject God's goodness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we define suicide as consisting of only free and uncoerced \nactions, we must ask a series of questions as we try to understand \nany particular suicide: To what extent do we know the suicide in \nquestion was genuinely free? Could pain (either physical or \nemotional) have coerced the individual to do what he otherwise might \nnot have done? But even if we could know that an act of suicide was \ngenuinely free, can we know that the aim of the act was indeed one's \nown death rather than a misguided cry for help? Can we know that the \nsuicide believed this action would really kill?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese questions lead us to withhold judgment in many cases; but more \ntelling yet is this question: Did the individual aim at removing \nhimself from God's goodness by suicide? Was this an act of suicide \ndirectly aimed at saying no to God? Or was it rather a tragically \nmisguided attempt at saying yes to God? Eternal punishment is \nreserved, Christians believe, for those who directly reject God and \nreject God as a consistent pattern in life, not merely in a solitary \nfinal act. Every suicide is not a rejection of God's goodness. \nIndeed, in many cases suicide is mistakenly chosen to bring one \nnearer to God. We cannot say that such a motive for suicide is \ncorrect. Nor can we say that a person who makes this tragic mistake \nhas removed herself forever from the grace of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church's task\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I comes to dealing with suicide, the church must do more than \nteach about it, for the church's primary task is to be the people of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst of all, the church must commit itself to being a community of \ntruth, a community in which believers tell the truth about their own \nlives. A church must hear the stories of pain, suffering, and failure \nin the lives of its members; and those who tell the stories must \nreceive from the church both lamentation and the healing balm of \nChrist. When the church is open and honest about pain and suffering, \nit can then confront in love even the most difficult of human crises \nand failures--suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the church must commit itself to being a community of love, \nnot quick to judge. Since suicide often brings with it the stigma of \n\"unpardonable sin\" and feelings of shame and guilt for the surviving \nfamily members, those currently free of pain must welcome those who \nsuffer in the name of Christ; and with the aid of the Holy Spirit, \nthey must place themselves at one another's disposal. A church might \nwell have a team ministry to contact and inquire daily about those \nwho are troubled. A church might also designate certain gifted \nindividuals to whom one might turn in distress. A community of love \nbears patiently with those who contemplate suicide and those who \ngrieve and feel guilty as a result of suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the church must commit itself to being a community of joy, a \ncommunity in which the new life of Christ is celebrated, a community \nthat calls others to celebrate in the new life of Christ. By living \nas a community of joy, by regularly celebrating God's goodness to us \nin Jesus Christ, the church ministers to those who are saddened, \njoyfully acquainting them with the One who has known their sorrows.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy student friend seems to be doing well these days. This is due in \nno small part to the fact that she worships in a church that has been \na community of truth, a community of love, and a community of joy. I \nam not sure she is able to give a clear theological explanation of \nher troubles; but I do think she know that her life is worthwhile. \nAnd this, with the Holy Spirit's aid, will sustain her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article originally appeared in the March 20, 1987, issue of \nChristianity Today. At the time, Thomas D. Kennedy was visiting \nassistant professor of religion at Hope College in Holland, Michigan. \nHe is now associate professor of philosophy at Valparaiso University \nin Valparaiso, Indiana. \\\u0002\u0014",

    "title": "SUICIDE--A PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY",
    "words": "Suicide - A Preventable Tragedy?\u0014\n\u0014\nA ministry helps churches handle the complex issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Peri Stone-Palmquist | posted 7/6/00\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor seemed to do everything right. He listened actively, \nprovided emotional support, and counseled the depressed woman for an \nentire year. \u0014\nBut she took her own life anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a time for the church to use its greatest strengths. But like \nthe pastor, some members of the church didnt know precisely how to \nrespond or help survivors. At the wake, one member approached the \ngrieving daughter. \"She told me my mother was in hell,\" Stephanie \nWeber says. Although the remark was made more than 20 years ago, \nWeber says, \"I can remember feeling so numb.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Weber discovered the hard way, many Christians do not know how to \nrespond to a suicide, and sometimes they inadvertently do more harm \nthan good. Weber and others are helping to change that through \nSuicide Prevention Services (SPS), one of the few advocacy \norganizations in the nation that deals with suicide prevention, \nintervention, and post-suicide assistance for victims families. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith their strong social support, life-affirming values, and love, \nChristians are in a unique position to fight a largely preventable \nproblem identified as the eighth-leading cause of death in the \nnation. \u0014\n\u0014\nBEYOND STAGGERING STATISTICS\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1998 suicide accounted for more than 29,000 deaths, compared to \nfewer than 19,000 from homicide and about 13,000 from AIDS, according \nto National Vital Statistics Reports. Even more astonishing is the \nnumber of Americans who attempt suicide each year but survive--more \nthan half a million. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese staggering statistics prompted Surgeon General David Satcher to \ndevelop a national suicide-prevention strategy. Last summer he \nreleased a \"Call to Action to Prevent Suicide,\" which included 15 \nrecommendations to increase awareness, step up research, and \nencourage intervention. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn those recommendations, Satcher identified church and synagogue \nleaders as \"natural community helpers\" on the issue. SPS has found a \nwelcome niche within the church, recruiting and training pastors and \nlay leaders to counsel and educate their own congregations. SPS also \nencourages helping larger communities, whether by volunteering with a \ncrisis phone line or helping counsel walk-ins at a crisis center. \u0014\n\u0014\nBased in Batavia, Ill., SPS focuses its efforts on Kane and Kendall \ncounties in the far western suburbs of Chicago, but the ministry \nhopes its urgent message will eventually reach a nationwide audience. \u0014\n\u0014\nPastors and congregations often do not have the resources or \nknowledge necessary to deal with such a complex and sensitive issue. \nSPS wants to change that. \u0014\nSPS already has succeeded with Wayne Miller, pastor at St. Marks \nLutheran Church in Aurora, Ill., and an SPS board member. Hes one of \nabout 15 pastors directly involved with SPS. \"They gave me a way to \nenter into the process constructively,\" Miller says. \"I didnt have \nthat before. I almost always felt helpless.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral people in Millers church attempted suicide in 1998. But only \none person under Millers care succeeded. \"The impact was huge,\" he \nsaid. \"Not like it was my fault, but it kicked up questions. Could I \nhave done something different?\" \u0014\nWhen SPS formed, Miller became involved and learned what resources \nwere available and what steps to take when dealing with a suicidal \nperson. \u0014\n\u0014\nPastors, family, and friends may not realize how easily counselors \ncan be overwhelmed when dealing with a person contemplating suicide. \nMiller learned that pastors should neither remove themselves \ncompletely from the situation nor try to go it alone. \"Theres a lot \nof people in different disciplines who try to be helpful, and we all \nhave part of the story,\" he says. \"But none of us has the whole \nstory.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe church is important, and even when pastors refer a suicidal \nperson elsewhere, the person will often come back to the church. \nCertain groups, including teenagers, white males, and the elderly, \nare at higher statistical risk for suicide. The National Center for \nInjury Prevention and Control rates suicide as the third-leading \ncause of death in the age bracket of 15 to 24. People younger than 25 \naccounted for 15 percent of all suicides in 1997. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhite males accounted for 72 percent. In fact, males are actually \nfour times as likely to die from suicide than females--but females \nare more likely to attempt suicide. In both males and females, \nsuicide rates increase with age and are highest among Americans age \n65 and older. \u0014\nNevertheless, suicide affects people of all races, ages, and walks of \nlife. The factors leading to suicide are varied--undiagnosed \ndepression, feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness and loneliness, \nalcohol or substance abuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen early warning signs appear, churches are in a unique position to \nconnect people with people. Signs that should be taken seriously \ninclude withdrawal from friends and once-enjoyable activities, \npersistent sadness and hopelessness, indecision, lack of \nconcentration, poor self-esteem, anger, and rage. When a person \nexhibits such behavior, church members do well to approach the \ndepressed person and offer supportive comments--\"Im praying for you. \nI know this must be a hard time for you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"People who are suicidal are great actors,\" Weber says. \"If they \ndont want a pastor to know, its out of your hands. But if you pick \nup on the signs, invite them in and listen. Let them talk about their \npain.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSPS teaches a specific response called Question, Persuade, and Refer. \nThe first step: \"You ask people very specific questions about how \ntheyre feeling, what theyre thinking,\" Miller says. \"You cant \nplant the idea of suicide--if its there, its there. But you cut \nthrough the shame when you talk about it.\" Miller asks questions like \n\"Are you considering suicide?\" and \"Do you think about it a lot? How \noften?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, persuade the person to get help--to make another plan amid \ndepression, to go to an emergency room or call in family members, \ndepending on the severity of the situation. \u0014\nThird, refer the person to available resources--a local crisis line, \na medical professional, or support groups. \u0014\n\u0014\nWeber also recommends accompanying the depressed person to the first \ncounseling session. \"Say, Ill pick you up and take you, \" she \nsays. \u0014\nFollow-up is key, and not just with those considering suicide. \nSurvivors also need continued support, which SPS board member Barb \nStidwell knows all too well. Her 16-year-old daughter, Meg, committed \nsuicide in the summer of 1995. Stidwell says she could never have \nendured this experience without God and her church. \"Ive only seen \nthat kind of love in Christians, that long-term support,\" she says. \n\"At work, for instance, people were acting like I should move on six \nmonths later.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nINSTEAD OF FLOWERS\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Stidwell, like Weber, also saw the awkwardness of many \nChristians responses to suicide. \"Wed have people over for dinner \nwho wouldnt even acknowledge that my daughter died,\" she says. \nStidwell also discovered that many people simply do not know what to \nsay. \"As a Christian, you dont have to have the right words,\" she \nsays. \"Just say, Im sorry, thats a terrible tragedy. We need to \nget to the point where people understand the sorrow without being \njudgmental.\" \u0014\nMost congregations have not wrestled with issues surrounding suicide \nand, Weber says, their members may believe that suicide is an \nunforgivable sin. When Stidwell visits churches, she often presents \nseveral questions for discussion: \u0014\n\u0014\n How can we as a church discourage suicide and still support, \nwithout condemnation, those whose loved ones have committed suicide? \u0014\n How can we encourage our congregation to support isolated and \ndepressed people among us? \u0014\n How can we reduce the stigma of suicide (in order to encourage open \ndiscussion) while still emphasizing the fallout of suicide on \nfamilies and friends (in order to discourage suicide attempts)? \u0014\n\u0014\nGary McCann, pastor at the New England Congregational Church in \nAurora, Ill., has posed questions like these to his congregation. \"We \nmust provide a community where everyone is included and accepted,\" he \nsays. \u0014\n\u0014\nMcCann helped organize a Suicide Prevention Sunday to help bring \nattention to the issue. The church displayed a quilt featuring \npictures of people who have committed suicide. \"Whenever it becomes \npersonal, people start to deal with it,\" he says. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Suicide Prevention Sunday service, church member Nancy \nHopp told the moving story of how her brothers suicide changed her \nforever. Hopp encourages Christians not only to focus on suicide \nprevention, but also to cultivate full relationships with loved ones. \nHer brother wrote his own obituary in advance, advising others: \"Take \nsomeone you know out to lunch this week and tell them how much you \nlove them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPeri Stone-Palmquist attends St. Martins Lutheran Church in Austin, \nTexas.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

She had been hospitalized in Tijuana, \nMexico, for several months. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Richard Wurmbrand was better known, for his experiences in \ncommunist prisons, his wife also endured severe persecution before \nthey fled the country in 1966. She spent 3 years in a prison labor \ncamp during the 1950s and was held under house arrest for several \nyears after release--being promised freedom if she would divorce her \nhusband, who was still in prison, and renounce her faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn into a Jewish family, she became a Christian in 1936 when she \nand Richard converted soon after their marriage. Several members of \nher family died in concentration camps during World War II. She \nhelped smuggle Jewish children out of the ghettos and was arrested \nseveral times for her underground Christian activities. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wurmbrands founded Christian Mission to the Communist \nWorld--later to become VM--on their escape from Romania, to champion \nthe needs of the persecuted church worldwide. The organization, with \nU.S. headquarters in Bartlesville, Okla., now has offices in 30 \ncountries. \u0014\n\u0014\nA VM spokesman said that Wurmbrand's life was \"characterized by an \nunderstanding of Christian love and forgiveness, with an effort to \nredeem lives for Christ.\" The funeral will be held tomorrow in \nCalifornia, where the Wurmbrands made their home.\u0014",

After Jesus' disciples asked him about the \ntiming of his coming, He said, I tell you the truth, this generation \nwill certainly not pass away until all these things have happened \n(MATTHEW 24:34). Jesus also said, For the Son of Man is going to \ncome in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward \neach person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some \nwho are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of \nMan coming in his kingdom\u0014\n(MATTHEW 16:27-28).\u0014\n\u0014\nNo shakes his head. These and many other time-restricted passages \npose a real dilemma for Christians who believe in the literal and \ninerrant truth of the Bible. Was Jesus mistaken? Did Jesus fail?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo points out that for the last two centuries, liberals have \nattacked Jesus' divinity and the Bible's accuracy precisely at this \npoint. They look at all the scriptures that promise Jesus' \nfirst-century return and conclude He was wrongbecause, supposedly, \nit didn't happen in the first century when He said it would.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the noted Christian apologist, C.S. Lewis, recognized the \nproblem with Jesus' alleged non-return. Lewis said Matthew 24:34, \n\"...is certainly the most embarrassing verse in the Bible (\"The \nWorld's Last Night\"  by C.S. Lewis).\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis did not defend Jesus well on this issue. Nor have many \nevangelicals who claim Jesus' return has been delayed or postponed \nfor some reason. Or that the timing of his return was misunderstood \nand that he will come back someday, soon, to finish the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the view popularized in the Left Behind books and soon-to-be \nHollywood movie.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Noe insists, The only solution to this dilemma of non-occurence \nis occurrence! It is the only biblically consistent solution that can \nstop the liberal attack dead in its tracks. Jenkins and LaHaye only \nadd to the dilemma by pushing Christ's return and their rapture idea \ninto the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Shattering the 'Left Behind'Delusion\" uses the Bible to explain:\u0014\n\u0014\n How all rapture scriptures have been fulfilled\u0014\n What this means for Christians today and in the future\u0014\n What kind of resurrection body Christians getand when\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn No says, The Preterist position (past fulfillment) is the most \nChristhonoring, Scripture-authenticating, and faith-validating of all \nmajor end-times views in the historic church.\u0014",

    "title": "SCIENCE, THE BIBLE, EVOLUTION, AND DAWINISM",
    "words": "Charles Hodge and B.B. Warfield on Science, the Bible, Evolution, \nand Darwinism\u0014\nMark Noll\u0014\n1998,1999 Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals\u0014\n\u0014\nControversies over evolution excite every bit as much passion in the \nlate twentieth century as they have ever done. Christian believers \nwho seek humbly to understand the means by which God directs the \nnatural world as well as honest scientists who seek to deal \nresponsibly with what their researches reveal are regularly shouted \naside by culture warriors heavily invested in the supposed struggle \nbetween science and religion. Truth is usually the loser; populist \npoliticking too often drives out patient, responsible science.1\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo of the great theologians in American Christian history sought a \nbetter way. Charles Hodge (1797-1878) and Benjamin Warfield \n(1851-1921) were the most influential theologians at Princeton \nTheological Seminary during the first century of that institution's \nexistence. During their tenure, Princeton was widely regarded as the \nnation's center of Presbyterian intellectual life, and Presbyterians \nwere properly regarded as among the country's leading intellectuals.2\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth of these Reformed stalwarts wrote learnedly about the most \nvexing theological issues raised by theories of evolution in their \nday. The specific assertions that Hodge and Warfield made about \nscience are still worthy of serious consideration today. Even more, \nhowever, the way in which they wrote about such issues--with patient \nanalysis and unhesitating confidence in both science and \nScripture--offers modern believers a better approach than extremist, \nanti-intellectual, or paranoid combat against the scientific \nestablishment. At the same time, they also offer scientific despisers \nof traditional biblical faith consequential examples of a responsible \nrespect for science that arises directly out of Christian belief.\u0014\n\u0014\nHodge, Warfield, and most of their colleagues at Princeton shared a \ncommon attitude toward science in relation to theology. Their steady \ngoal was to preserve the harmony of truth. Hodge and Warfield refused \nto countenance any permanent antagonism between the two realms of \nknowledge: what humans, by God's grace, could discover about the \nnatural world (which owed its origin to God), and what they could \nlearn, again by grace, about the character and acts of God from \nspecial revelation in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir common mentality was that of scholars. Hodge and Warfield were \nalike committed to thorough reasoning. They thought it was a \nChristian duty to use their minds fully to understand the world. They \ndid not set reasoning about the physical world and interpretations of \ndivine revelation in opposition, but rather held that properly \nqualified deliverances of the human intellect and properly understood \nconclusions from Scripture were complementary. As a consequence, they \nwere patient in unpacking detailed arguments in theology as well as \nin philosophy, and they abhorred merely rhetorical responses to \ncomplicated intellectual problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nHodge and Warfield also held common intellectual convictions. \nTheologically, they were Calvinists who maintained traditional \nReformed convictions about most subjects, including nature. \nSpecifically, they held that the world owed both its origin and its \nongoing operation to the direct activity of God. They believed that \nGod was responsible for the orderliness of natural processes; that \nthe human ability to discern this order in nature was a gift from \nGod; and that investigations of nature testified to the work of a \npurposeful designer. They also felt that Scripture provided reliable \ngeneral information about the physical world.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilosophically, the Princeton theologians were committed to the \nprinciples of common-sense reasoning as these principles had been \nimported to North American in the eighteenth century by Scotsmen like \nJohn Witherspoon (president of Princeton College from 1768 to 1794) \nand then developed by a host of American commentators. Their \ncommon-sense philosophy featured trust in ordinary human intuitions \nagainst the skeptical speculations of philosophers like David Hume. \nProponents of this philosophy drew on sophisticated arguments by \nScots like Thomas Reid and popularizations of those views in works \nlike the Encyclopedia Britannica as edited by Reid's follower, Dugald \nStewart. With such support, Americans easily turned aside doubts \nabout the reality of the self and the reality of normal cause and \neffect connections. As testified to by the opening discussion of \nmethod in Hodge's Systematic Theology, the Princeton theologians \nshared at least some of the American enthusiasm for Sir Isaac Newton, \nas the doyen of modern science, and Sir Francis Bacon, as the most \nfamous early promoter of an epistemology of induction. The \nPrincetonians' Calvinistic convictions about the debilitating \ncharacter of sinfulness did not always fit smoothly with their \ncommon-sense philosophy. Yet that philosophy was common intellectual \ncoinage in nineteenth-century America, and they were among the \nAmerican intellectuals who put it most skillfully to use.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways, the Princetonians' theology of nature and their \nphilosophy of common sense were typical of most American Christians \nduring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. But unlike at least \nsome other conservatives, they also held that Scripture did not need \nto be interpreted literally when it referred to nature. Perhaps even \nmore untypically, they held that the findings of science should be \nenlisted to help discover proper interpretations of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Princeton theologians were interested in science for several \ninterrelated reasons. First was confessional. As Calvinists, they \nbelieved the physical world was an arena in which God manifested his \npower and glory. Scientific research, therefore, was a way of finding \nout more about the world God had made, but also about the God who had \nmade the world. Second was apologetic. The Princeton theologians knew \nthat in the wake of Newton and the Mechanical Philosophy, science was \nbeing increasingly used to attack traditional Christian faith. If \nothers used science to discredit Christianity, it was the \nresponsibility of mature believers to show the error of such abuse. \nThird was social and ideological. They thought that Christian \nappropriation of science was critical for the health of civilization \nin America. If science (or any other false source of ultimate value) \nundercut faith in God, evil would inevitably proliferate, public \nvirtue would retreat, and civilization would be imperiled.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, such views about relationships among science, theology, and \ncivil society also implied much about the Princeton theologians' own \nrole. Hodge, Warfield, and their colleagues were remarkably pious \npeople; personal testimonies abound to their unusual humility. At the \nsame time, they also possessed an extraordinarily lofty conception of \ntheir vocation. They were guardians not just of theology, and not \nonly of relationships between science and theology, but of Truth and \nof Civilization. Part of their concern for the spread of sub- or \nanti-Christian uses of science was, thus, concern about themselves. \nIf scientists with no concern for the theological traditions they \ndefended succeeded in becoming public arbiters of the culture's most \ninfluential questions, it was obvious that the theologians would also \nbe displaced from their positions of cultural authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nScience in general, therefore, was important to Hodge and Warfield \nboth because of what they believed and because of who they were. \nEspecially as the pace of scientific discovery quickened in the \nnineteenth century, and as alternatives to Christian appropriations \nof scientific knowledge grew more forceful, their concern deepened.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlike as they were on many matters, Hodge and Warfield did differ--or \nat least appeared to differ--on whether evolution was acceptable to \nChristianity. Hodge, who is best known for his short book, What Is \nDarwinism? (1874), but who also wrote much else on science, did not \nthink Darwinism was compatible with the faith. For his part, Warfield \nover a thirty-year period published at least thirty-nine articles and \nreviews, some of them substantial, on questions related to evolution. \nThroughout most of his career, he held that evolution might be \ncompatible with the Christian faith. Despite this apparent \ndifference, however, to understand the way each theologian approached \nhis work is to see the substantial continuity of their convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Hodge\u0014\nCharles Hodge came to write about Darwin after a lifetime of serious \nattention to scientific issues. That interest was partly a familial \nlegacy. Both his father and his brother were Philadelphia physicians, \nand Hodge himself attended medical lectures during several periods of \nhis life, including the trip he took to Europe as a young theological \nprofessor in 1826-1828.\u0014\n\u0014\nHodge's interests in scientific matters led to a long-time friendship \nwith Joseph Henry, a professor of science at Princeton College who \nlater was the inaugural director of the Smithsonian Institution. \n(Henry also served several years as a trustee of Princeton Seminary \nand was a serious Presbyterian layman.) Hodge recruited Henry to \nwrite for the Princeton Review,3 he included Henry in the informal \nmeetings where the editorial business of the Review was carried out, \nhe worked hard to keep Henry at Princeton when other institutions \ntried to lure him away, and he took special delight when Henry was \nintroduced to the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1843 as a man who \ncarried out scientific duties with a due sense of piety.4 During the \nperiod when Hodge's \"rheumatic\" leg gave him the most difficulty, he \neven applied electricity to the afflicted limb from a machine that \nHenry had invented. Henry was not altogether pleased with this \nexperiment, and, in the event, it did not relieve Hodge's condition, \nbut it does indicate something of the relationship the two enjoyed.5 \nFor modern purposes, the Hodge-Henry friendship is significant for \nits ability to transcend differences of scientific opinion. Henry, \nafter initially doubting the compatibility between any form of \nevolution and traditional Christianity, eventually came reluctantly \nto accept a Christianized form of evolution.6 But even though Hodge \ncould not agree, he remained on very cordial terms with his \nscientific friend.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to his avocational scientific interests, Hodge, at least \nfrom the late 1840s, regularly lectured and wrote on issues \nconcerning the relationship of science and Scripture.7 A letter to \nthe New York Observer in March 1863 showed clearly how Hodge felt \nscience and theology should interact.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe first affirmed that the Bible could \"teach no error\" on anything \nthat it touched. But then he hastened to say that the Princeton \ntheologians had always held, \"in common with the whole Church, that \nthis infallible Bible must be interpreted by science.\" True to form, \nHodge took pains to spell out what he meant by \"science\": \n\"ascertained truths concerning the facts and laws of nature.\" Yet \nonce having made a careful definition, Hodge forcefully affirmed the \nhermeneutical value of scientific knowledge: \"The proposition that \nthe Bible must be interpreted by science is all but self-evident. \nNature is as truly a revelation of God as the Bible, and we only \ninterpret the Word of God by the Word of God when we interpret the \nBible by science.\" Hodge then provided an example of what he meant: \n\"For five thousand years the Church understood the Bible to teach \nthat the earth stood still in space, and that the sun and stars \nrevolved around it. Science has demonstrated that this is not true. \nShall we go on to interpret the Bible so as to make it teach the \nfalsehood that the sun moves round the earth, or shall we interpret \nit by science and make the two harmonize?\" Hodge closed with a word \nin the other direction: just as legitimate science must be used to \ninterpret Scripture, so must Scripture be allowed to shape the \ninterpretation of science. In his words, Hodge wanted to avoid both \nsides of \"a two-fold evil.\" One evil was the overwillingness \"to \nadopt the opinions and theories of scientific men, and to adopt \nforced and unnatural interpretations of the Bible, to bring it to \naccord with those opinions.\" The opposite evil was to \"not only \nrefuse to admit the opinions of men, but science itself, to have any \nvoice in the interpretation of Scripture.\"8\u0014\n\u0014\nThe strategy Hodge outlined in 1863 was the strategy he followed \neleven years later in What Is Darwinism? In the pages of this book \nHodge took great pains to define the meaning of \"Darwinism\" and to \ndistinguish what might possibly be real science from invalid \nspeculation. As he saw it, \"Darwinism\" entailed three assertions:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) that species undergo evolutionary development over time;\u0014\n(2) that natural selection (defined as variety, overproduction, and \nsurvival of the fittest), explains important aspects of those \nchanges; and\u0014\n(3) that these changes are ateleological, or entirely the result of \nrandom occurrences.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it happens, Hodge himself had doubts about the compatibility of \nthe first two assertions with biblical Christianity, but he also \nacknowledged that other orthodox Christians did not. As an example of \na scientist who did not, Hodge mentioned several times in his essay \nAsa Gray, an orthodox Congregationalist who taught at Harvard and who \nwas the most important promoter of Darwin's writings in America. \nAlmost certainly, Hodge also had in mind the president of Princeton \nCollege, James McCosh, who was also a reconciler of Christianity and \nevolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was, however, the third assertion that meant the most to Hodge: \n\"by far the most important and only distinctive element of his \ntheory, that this natural selection is without design, being \nconducted by unintelligent physical causes.\" In pursuit of clarity, \nHodge repeated that, \"It is...neither evolution nor natural selection \nwhich gives Darwinism its peculiar character and importance. It is \nthat Darwin rejects all teleology or the doctrine of final causes.\" \nThis definition led to Hodge's famous condemnation at the end of the \nbook: \"We have thus arrived at the answer to our question, What is \nDarwinism? It is Atheism. This does not mean, as before said, that \nMr. Darwin himself and all who adopt his views are atheists; but it \nmeans that his theory is atheistic, that the exclusion of design from \nnature is, as Dr. Gray says, tantamount to atheism.\"9\u0014\n\u0014\nBenjamin Breckinridge Warfield\u0014\nHodge's careful distinctions about what he denounced as the atheism \nof Darwinism paves the way for understanding why B. B. Warfield's \nmore accommodating attitude to evolution was, in fact, largely \ncompatible with that of his revered teacher and predecessor. \nWarfield's publications on evolution and related subjects included \nseveral kinds of writing: major essays devoted to Darwin's biography \n(\"Charles Darwin's Religious Life\" in 1888 and \"Darwin's Arguments \nAgainst Christianity\" the next year); several substantial articles \ndirectly on evolution or related scientific issues (\"The Present Day \nConception of Evolution\" in 1895, \"Creation Versus Evolution\" in \n1901, \"On the Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race\" in 1911, and \n\"Calvin's Doctrine of Creation\" in 1915); and many reviews, some of \nthem mini-essays in their own right (among the most important of \nthese concerned books by James McCosh in 1888, by J. W. Dawson in \n1891, by Otto Pfleiderer in 1901, by James Orr in 1906, and by Vernon \nKellogg in 1908).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn these writings, Warfield repeatedly insisted on the distinction \nbetween Darwin as a person, Darwinism as a cosmological theory, and \nevolution as a series of explanations about natural development. Of \nkey importance for Warfield was his willingness throughout a long \ncareer to accept the possibility (or even the probability) of \nevolution, yet while also denying Darwinism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWarfield's strongest assertion of evolution was theological and came \nin a lengthy paper on Calvin's view of creation. Warfield ascribed to \nCalvin what was doubtless his own view as well: \"[A]ll that has come \ninto being since [the original creation of the world stuff]--except \nthe souls of men alone--has arisen as a modification of this original \nworld-stuff by means of the interaction of its intrinsic \nforces...[These modifications] find their account proximately in \n'secondary causes'; and this is not only evolutionism but pure \nevolutionism.\"10 To grasp the underlying harmony between this \nstatement and Hodge's earlier equation of Darwinism with atheism, it \nis necessary to pay strict attention to the distinctions that Hodge \ncautiously advanced in his 1874 book and that Warfield developed much \nmore boldly in most of his writings on the subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a way of positioning Warfield properly on these subjects it is \nvital to stress a conjunction of his convictions that has been much \nless common since his day. Warfield, in short, was both the ablest \nmodern defender of the theologically conservative belief in the \ninerrancy of the Bible and an evolutionist.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the late nineteenth century when critical views of Scripture \ncame to prevail in American universities, Warfield was more \nresponsible than any other American for refurbishing the conviction \nthat the Bible communicates revelation from God entirely without \nerror. Warfield's formulation of biblical inerrancy, in fact, has \neven been a theological mainstay for recent \"creationist\" convictions \nabout the origin of the earth.11 Yet Warfield was also a cautious, \ndiscriminating, but entirely candid proponent of the possibility that \nevolution might offer the best way to understand the natural history \nof the earth and of humankind. On this score his views place him with \nmore recent thinkers who maintain ancient trust in the Bible while \naffirming the modern scientific enterprise.12 Warfield did not simply \nassert these two views randomly, but he sustained them learnedly, as \ncoordinate arguments. Accordingly, Warfield's convictions on theology \nand evolution are as interesting a commentary on our own era's \nintellectual warfare as they are illuminating for historical \nconjunctions in his age.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the course of his career, both Warfield's positions and his \nvocabulary shifted on the question of evolution. But they shifted \nonly within the constraints of a fairly narrow range. What remained \nconstant was his adherence to a broad Calvinistic conception of the \nnatural world--of a world that, even in its most physical aspects, \nreflected the wisdom and glory of God--and his commitment to the goal \nof harmonizing a sophisticated conservative theology and the most \nsecurely verified conclusions of modern science. Another way of \ndescribing the constancy of his position is to say that while \nWarfield consistently rejected materialist or ateleological \nexplanations for natural phenomena (explanations that he usually \nassociated with \"Darwinism\"), Warfield just as consistently \nentertained the possibility that other kinds of evolutionary \nexplanations, which avoided Darwin's rejection of design, could \nsatisfactorily explain the physical world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn several of his writings, Warfield worked carefully to distinguish \nthree ways in which God worked in and through the physical world. The \nmost important thing about these three ways is that Warfield felt \neach of them was compatible with the theology he found in an inerrant \nBible, if each was applied properly to natural history and to the \nhistory of salvation. \"Evolution\" meant developments arising out of \nforces that God had placed inside matter at the original creation of \nthe world stuff, but that God also directed to predetermined ends by \nhis providential superintendence of the world. At least in writings \ntoward the end of his life, Warfield held that evolution in this \nsense was fully compatible with biblical understandings of the \nproduction of the human body. \"Mediate creation\" meant the action of \nGod upon matter to bring something new into existence that could not \nhave been produced by forces or energy latent in matter itself. He \ndoes not apply the notion of \"mediate creation\" directly in his last, \nmost mature writings on evolution, but it may be that he expounded \nthe concept as much to deal with miracles or other biblical events \nthan for developments in the natural world.13 The last means of God's \naction was \"creation ex nihilo,\" which Warfield consistently \nmaintained was the way that God made the original stuff of the world. \nIt also seems that, in his 1915 article on Calvin, when he considered \nthe soul of every human, Warfield held that God created each soul \ndirectly ex nihilo.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout Warfield's career, the concept of concursus was especially \nimportant for both theology and science. Just as the authors of \nScripture were completely human in writing the Bible, even as they \nenjoyed the full inspiration of the Holy Spirit, so too could all \nliving creatures develop fully (with the exception of the original \ncreation and the human soul) through \"natural\" means. The key for \nWarfield was a doctrine of Providence that saw God working in and \nwith, instead of as a replacement for, the processes of nature. Late \nin his career, this stance also grounded Warfield's opposition to \n\"faith healing.\" In his eyes, physical healing through medicine and \nthe agency of physicians was as much a result of God's action (if \nthrough secondary causes) as the cures claimed as a direct result of \ndivine intervention.14 For his views on evolution, concursus was as \nimportant, and as fruitful, as it was for his theology as a whole. It \nwas a principle he felt the Scriptures offered to enable humans both \nto approach the world fearlessly and to do so for the greater glory \nof God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWarfield's writings on evolution, the last of which appeared in the \nyear of his death, 1921, cannot, of course, pronounce definitively on \ntheological-scientific questions at the end of the twentieth century. \nThey can, however, show that sophisticated theology, nuanced \nargument, and careful sifting of scientific research are able to \nproduce a much more satisfactory working relationship between science \nand theology than the heated strife which has dominated public debate \non this subject since the time of Warfield's passing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commitment of Warfield and Hodge to solid empirical science and \nto the concursus of divine and natural action gave them extraordinary \nbalance in sifting the difficult questions of science and faith that \nbeset their era. One of the reasons that many in subsequent decades \nhave failed to retain their equipoise on this subject may be that \nthey have abandoned one or both of these commitments.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotes\u0014\n1.

He'd been drafted into \u0014\nthe army, but the authorities had mistaken his native Hungarian \u0014\nlanguage for the gibberish of a lunatic and had him committed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they forgot about him. For 53 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago a psychiatrist at the hospital began to realize \u0014\nwhat had happened and helped Tamas recover the memories of who \u0014\nhe was and where he came from. He recently returned home to \u0014\nBudapest as a war hero, \"the last prisoner of World War II.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only had this man forgotten his real name, he hadn't even \u0014\nseen his own face in five decades. So, according to one news \u0014\naccount, \"For hours, the old man studies the face in a mirror. \u0014\nThe deep-set eyes. The gray stubble on the chin. The furrows of \u0014\nthe brow. It is his face, but it is a startling revelation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nImagine looking at your own face in a mirror and not \u0014\nrecognizing it.

Leon explained that hippies, having\u0014\n            been turned off by the churches, are drawn to\u0014\n            Scientology because it represents a radical\u0014\n            departure from tradition. Magazine articles\u0014\n            denouncing Scientology have elicited an\u0014\n            enthusiastic reaction from the hippie community.\u0014\n            \"If the establishment is against it, it must be\u0014\n            good,\" they reason.\u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Do hippies forsake drugs when they embrace\u0014\n            Scientology?\" I asked. \"Yes, they do,\" replied\u0014\n            Anne. \"When Scientology turns them on, they no\u0014\n            longer need drugs. In fact, you might call\u0014\n            Scientology the 'turned-on religion.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            But the Scientology bandwagon had started to\u0014\n            roll long before the press denunciations began. A\u0014\n            year ago Life estimated world membership at\u0014\n            between two and three million, several hundred\u0014\n            thousand of them in the United States. Not bad\u0014\n            for an infant organization less than two decades\u0014\n            old! There are twenty-five Scientology centers\u0014\n            throughout the world: one in England, one in\u0014\n            Scotland, one in Denmark, one in Rhodesia, four\u0014\n            in South Africa, three in Australia, one in New\u0014\n            Zealand, one in Canada, and eleven in the\u0014\n            United States (Washington, New York, Miami,\u0014\n            Detroit, Minneapolis, Austin, Las Vegas, Los\u0014\n            Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Honolulu).\u0014\n\u0014\n            The charismatic figure who began this\u0014\n            mushrooming cult is Lafayette Ronald (L. Ron)\u0014\n            Hubbard, millionaire science-fiction writer,\u0014\n            explorer, and retired naval officer who claims to\u0014\n            be the real life \"Mr. Roberts\" from the movie of\u0014\n            that name. Hubbard was born in Nebraska in\u0014\n            1911, the son of a career officer in the U. S.\u0014\n            Navy and the grandson of a wealthy Montana\u0014\n            cattle-rancher. While the family lived in\u0014\n            Washington, \"Elron\" became \"the youngest Eagle\u0014\n            Scout in America\" and a fast friend of\u0014\n            then-President Coolidge's son Calvin, Jr. It is\u0014\n            thought that Calvin's premature death may have\u0014\n            sparked Hubbard's quest for the secrets of\u0014\n            mental and physical health.\u0014\n\u0014\n            During the late twenties Navy duty took the\u0014\n            Hubbard family to the Far East, where L. Ron\u0014\n            traveled widely and was exposed to a number of\u0014\n            the influences that helped to shape his emerging\u0014\n            philosophy. He returned to the States in 1930 to\u0014\n            enter college. Until a few years ago, when the\u0014\n            facts were openly challenged, Scientology\u0014\n            literature listed Hubbard as a 1934 graduate of\u0014\n            George Washington University with a B.S. in\u0014\n            civil engineering, and the recipient of a Ph.D.\u0014\n            degree from Sequoia University in 1950.\u0014\n            However, George Washington denies ever\u0014\n            having granted Hubbard a degree, affirming only\u0014\n            that he matriculated as a freshman in 1930,\u0014\n            flunked physics, was placed on probation, and\u0014\n            dropped out at the end of his second year. As\u0014\n            for the alleged Ph.D. degree, if an institution\u0014\n            bearing the name of Sequoia University even\u0014\n            exists, the burden of proof rests upon Hubbard\u0014\n            and the Scientologists.\u0014\n\u0014\n            After college, Hubbard led several scientific\u0014\n            expeditions into the primitive jungles of Central\u0014\n            America, and in 1936, at the age of twenty-five,\u0014\n            he joined the exclusive Explorer's Club in New\u0014\n            York City. During this period he flowered as a\u0014\n            prolific writer of both fact and fiction, and was\u0014\n            called to Hollywood to write the first of several\u0014\n            scenarios.\u0014\n\u0014\n            After five years of naval service during World\u0014\n            War II, Hubbard became critically ill. Crippled,\u0014\n            blind, and twice declared dead by doctors, he\u0014\n            rebounded to perfect health, he says, by\u0014\n            applying the principles later described in his\u0014\n            book Dianetics: The Modern Science Of\u0014\n            Mental Health. This 435-page volume, the\u0014\n            culmination of years of research, was written in\u0014\n            the space of sixty days and sold 100,000 copies\u0014\n            within three months of its publication in 1950. Its\u0014\n            eclectic sources include, says Hubbard in the\u0014\n            book, \"the medicine man of the Goldi people of\u0014\n            Manchuria, the shamans of North Borneo, Sioux\u0014\n            medicine men, the cults of Los Angeles \u0014\n            modern psychology (Jung, Adler, Freud,\u0014\n            Pavlov), a magician whose ancestors served in\u0014\n            the court of Kublai Khan and a Hindu who could\u0014\n            hypnotize cats\" (p. 128). Buddhism seems to\u0014\n            have played a prominent role; Hubbard\u0014\n            describes it as \"the only organization which has\u0014\n            had the goal of Total Freedom.\" Dianetics, he\u0014\n            says, revived that search after a silence of nearly\u0014\n            2,500 years. Nuclear philosophy also was\u0014\n            tapped. As Time describes it (August 23,\u0014\n            1968), the philosophy of Scientology \"is billed as\u0014\n            a sort of religion of religions, combining parts of\u0014\n            Hindu Veda and Dharma, Taoism, Old\u0014\n            Testament wisdom, Buddhist principles of\u0014\n            brotherly love and compassion, the early\u0014\n            Greeks, Lucretius, Spinoza, Nietzsche,\u0014\n            Schopenhauer, Spencer, and Freud.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            But the end is not yet. Hubbard's pursuit of a\u0014\n            therapy capable of curing all human ills led him\u0014\n            along the route of hypnotism, narco-synthesis\u0014\n            (\"the practice of inducing sleep with drugs and\u0014\n            then talking to the patient to draw out buried\u0014\n            thoughts\"), amnesia sleep, automatic writing,\u0014\n            clairvoyance, and exorcism. All were rejected.\u0014\n            Then at last came the great enlightenment. The\u0014\n            brain is the \"electronic calculator\"--a flawless\u0014\n            computer that functions perfectly except when\u0014\n            fouled up by \"engross\" (traumatic memories that\u0014\n            trigger pain). Get rid of these survival-threatening\u0014\n            engrams and you have an optimum brain.\"\u0014\n            Anxieties and illnesses promptly disappear.\u0014\n\u0014\n            The splash created by this do-it-yourself method\u0014\n            of psychotherapy was enormous (approximately\u0014\n            500,000 followers) but short-lived. Overhead\u0014\n            organization and professionally administered\u0014\n            techniques were lacking. A new strategy was\u0014\n            called for. Thus Scientology arose from the\u0014\n            ashes of Dianetics in the Year of Our Lord\u0014\n            1952.\u0014\n\u0014\n            To replace the self-therapy of Dianetics,\u0014\n            Hubbard devised the E-meter (Hubbard\u0014\n            Electrometer) or \"truth detectors\u0014\n            battery-operated device consisting of two tin\u0014\n            cans hooked up to a dial. The Scientology\u0014\n            counterpart of Mark Hopkins and a student at\u0014\n            opposite ends of a log is an \"auditor\"\u0014\n            (Scientology expert) and a \" preclear\" (novice,\u0014\n            seeker) on opposite sides of an E-meter. The\u0014\n            auditor watches the dial as the preclear, holding\u0014\n            the cans, replies to questions designed to bring\u0014\n            to the surface hidden engrams. When the subject\u0014\n            is able to identify and confront without fear all\u0014\n            these malevolent gremlins (that is, when the\u0014\n            E-meter needle ceases to fluctuate reflexively as\u0014\n            the engrams are trotted out one by one), he is\u0014\n            said to be a \"clear.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            Some engrams, according to Scientologists, are\u0014\n            prenatal, even harking back to previous\u0014\n            existences. Hubbard goes so far as to insist \"that\u0014\n            individuals cannot be rehabilitated unless the\u0014\n            prenatal engrams are accepted\" (Dianetics, p.\u0014\n            102). In an article entitled \"Scientology: Menace\u0014\n            to Mental Health,\" Ralph Lee Smith cites a\u0014\n            preclear who, upon ransacking his subconscious,\u0014\n            allegedly discovered that:\u0014\n\u0014\n                 His thetan [spirit] had inhabited the\u0014\n                 body of a doll on the planet Mars,\u0014\n                 469,476,600 years ago. Martians\u0014\n                 seized the doll and took it to a\u0014\n                 temple, where it was zapped by a\u0014\n                 bishop's gun while the congregation\u0014\n                 chanted \"God is Love.\" The thetan\u0014\n                 was then put into an ice cube,\u0014\n                 placed aboard a flying saucer, and\u0014\n                 dropped off at Planet ZX 432,\u0014\n                 where it was given a robot body,\u0014\n                 then put to work unloading flying\u0014\n                 saucers. Being a bit unruly, it\u0014\n                 zapped another robot to death and\u0014\n                 was shipped off in a flying saucer to\u0014\n                 be punished. But the saucer\u0014\n                 exploded, and the thetan fell into\u0014\n                 space [Today's Health,\u0014\n                 December, 1968].\u0014\n\u0014\n            Another preclear \"recalled that he had been\u0014\n            Marc Antony. He remembered Cleopatra, but\u0014\n            she apparently had given him such a whopping\u0014\n            engram that he couldn't recall the battles of\u0014\n            Philippi and Actium.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            The cover blurb on Scientology: The\u0014\n            Fundamentals of Thought boasts: \"No such\u0014\n            knowledge has ever before existed and no such\u0014\n            results have ever before been attainable by Man\u0014\n            as those which can be reached by a study of this\u0014\n            brief volume.\" Inside the 136-page paperback,\u0014\n            the reader encounters a host of similar claims:\u0014\n\u0014\n                 This book is a summation, in brief,\u0014\n                 of the results of 50,000 years of\u0014\n                 thinking men.

Biophysics only\u0014\n                 became feasible when it was\u0014\n                 discovered in Scientology that a\u0014\n                 fixed electrical field existed\u0014\n                 surrounding a body entirely\u0014\n                 independent of, but influenceable\u0014\n                 by, the human mind [p. 70].\u0014\n\u0014\n                 It is the only science or study\u0014\n                 known which is capable of\u0014\n                 uniformly producing marked and\u0014\n                 significant increases in intelligence\u0014\n                 and general ability. Scientolology\u0014\n                 processing among, other things can\u0014\n                 improve the intelligent quotient of\u0014\n                 an individual, his ability or desire to\u0014\n                 communicate, his social attitudes,\u0014\n                 his capability and domestic\u0014\n                 harmony, his fertility, his artistic\u0014\n                 creativity, his reaction time and his\u0014\n                 health [p. 98].\u0014\n\u0014\n                 With Scientology man can prevent\u0014\n                 insanity, criminality and war. \u0014\n                 The only race that matters at this\u0014\n                 moment is the one being run\u0014\n                 between Scientology and the\u0014\n                 atomic bomb [p. 128].\u0014\n\u0014\n            But the description of the supernatural\u0014\n            attainments of Scientology is not limited to\u0014\n            generalities. Specific Miracles are claimed.\u0014\n            Hubbard himself testifies that his thetan has\u0014\n            visited Venus once and Heaven twice.\u0014\n            (Incidentally, the second of his three wives\u0014\n            testified that he was \"hopelessly insane.\") \"Tens\u0014\n            of thousands of case histories\" record miraculous\u0014\n            hearings of mind and body through Scientology\u0014\n            techniques. The claim is made that through the\u0014\n            creation of \"mental energy,\" up to thirty pounds\u0014\n            have been added to or subtracted from a\u0014\n            person's body weight. Furthermore, Scientology\u0014\n            can \"raise the intelligence quotient of a person\u0014\n            about one point per hour of processing\" (A Brief\u0014\n            Biography of L. Ron Hubbard, p. 10). At that\u0014\n            astounding rate, the cost of producing an\u0014\n            Einstein, at $30 per processing hour, would be\u0014\n            relatively small. And to think that the ability to\u0014\n            accomplish these miracles can be attained in a\u0014\n            period of weeks and for only a few hundred\u0014\n            dollars!\u0014\n\u0014\n            It is a curious thing that a great many intelligent,\u0014\n            well educated, and apparently well-balanced\u0014\n            people have flocked to this movement. Take\u0014\n            Anne Ursprung, for example. Reared in Texas,\u0014\n            she was active in Southern Baptist youth work\u0014\n            and at one time wanted to become a\u0014\n            Christian-education director. At Baylor\u0014\n            University she majored in English and history,\u0014\n            and after her graduation she accepted a job as\u0014\n            an English teacher in the District of Columbia.\u0014\n            Her active involvement in Scientology began in\u0014\n            November 1967, when she began teaching\u0014\n            evening classes at the Founding Church while\u0014\n            continuing her daytime job in the Washington\u0014\n            public-school system. The following February\u0014\n            she became a full-time employee of the church,\u0014\n            and in July she was elevated to the position of\u0014\n            \"assistant guardian,\" the local congregation's\u0014\n            highest administrative office. Modest, poised,\u0014\n            elegant in dress and manner, Miss Ursprung\u0014\n            could easily pass for the Christian-education\u0014\n            worker she once hoped to become.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Esther Mangold, another full-time employee of\u0014\n            the Founding Church, is a graduate of the\u0014\n            Westminster Choir College and once served as\u0014\n            minister of music in a large mainline church in the\u0014\n            Midwest.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Just recently, in response to punitive measures\u0014\n            by the British Parliament, the organization\u0014\n            published a pamphlet entitled A Report to\u0014\n            Members of Parliament on Scientology. The\u0014\n            booklet contains testimonies by an impressive list\u0014\n            of Scientologists, among them a dental surgeon,\u0014\n            two medical doctors, a former chemistry\u0014\n            professor now devoting his life to Scientology, a\u0014\n            Ph.D. professor of languages, and a mechanical\u0014\n            engineer. All laud Scientology as the panacea for\u0014\n            all ills, individual and social.\u0014\n\u0014\n            According to Miss Ursprung, the Scientology\u0014\n            ranks have been swelled by a considerable\u0014\n            number of Protestant clergymen. Perhaps the\u0014\n            best explanation for this incongruity is that most\u0014\n            people consider Scientology not a religion but a\u0014\n            school of psychotherapy, despite Scientology\u0014\n            claims to the contrary. Although Miss Ursprung\u0014\n            classified Dianetics, forerunner of Scientology, as\u0014\n            a \"science of mind,\" she insists that Scientology is\u0014\n            \"a religion, a religious philosophy, a way of life.\"\u0014\n            The distinction is based on Scientology's \"eight\u0014\n            dynamics.\" The first four, which come under the\u0014\n            purview of Dianetics, are the survival instincts of\u0014\n            (1) self, (2) sex and family, (3) group (school,\u0014\n            society, town, nation), and (4) mankind (all races\u0014\n            and nations). The last four relate to man as a\u0014\n            spiritual being: (5) the animal dynamic (the urge\u0014\n            to preserve animal and vegetable life), (6) the\u0014\n            MEST (matter, energy, space, time) dynamic\u0014\n            (the urge to preserve the physical universe), (7)\u0014\n            the spiritual dynamic (the urge to perpetuate\u0014\n            spiritual existence in the here and now), and (8)\u0014\n            the Infinity or God dynamic (the instinct relating\u0014\n            to immortal existence beyond the earthly life).\u0014\n            Oddly enough, the one area most directly\u0014\n            involving religious experience is ruled out of\u0014\n            bounds. Hubbard emphasizes, \"It is carefully\u0014\n            observed here that the science of Scientology\u0014\n            does not intrude into the Dynamic of the\u0014\n            Supreme Being\" (Scientology, pp. 39, 40).\u0014\n\u0014\n            By what stretch of the imagination, then, can\u0014\n            Scientology be classified as a religion? Miss\u0014\n            Ursprung's answer is that a man's relation with\u0014\n            the Supreme Being is an individual matter.\u0014\n            Self-understanding is the primary goal of\u0014\n            Scientology. A man cannot know his Maker until\u0014\n            he first of all knows himself. But, she insists,\u0014\n            reverential attitudes are definitely encouraged in\u0014\n            the movement. She quoted from Hubbard's\u0014\n            1951 volume, Science of Survival: \"No culture\u0014\n            in the history of the world, save the thoroughly\u0014\n            depraved and expiring one, has failed to affirm\u0014\n            the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an\u0014\n            empirical observation that men without a strong\u0014\n            and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less\u0014\n            capable, less ethical, and less valuable to\u0014\n            themselves and society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            I was still puzzled. How could an organization\u0014\n            erected on a theistic foundation, calling itself a\u0014\n            church, be utterly divorced from prayer,\u0014\n            worship, the Scriptures, and the sacraments? In\u0014\n            the booklet Ceremonies of the Founding Church\u0014\n            of Scientology are found marriage, christening,\u0014\n            and funeral liturgies, not one of which includes a\u0014\n            single prayer or reference to the Deity. This\u0014\n            \"informal christening\" service, actually performed\u0014\n            by L. Ron Hubbard and. recommended as a\u0014\n            guide, illustrates these omissions:\u0014\n\u0014\n                 O.K.

Did that\u0014\n                 upset you? Now, do you realize\u0014\n                 that you're a member of the HASI\u0014\n                 (Hubbard Association of\u0014\n                 Scientologists, International)?\u0014\n                 Pretty good, huh?\u0014\n\u0014\n                 All right. Now I want to introduce\u0014\n                 you to your father. This is Mr. (To\u0014\n                 the parent): Come over here.

He's\u0014\n                 your godfather. Now, take a look\u0014\n                 at him. That s right.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 And here's in case you want some\u0014\n                 real good auditing: she's your\u0014\n                 godmother. Got it?\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Now you are suitably christened.\u0014\n                 Don't worry about it, it could be\u0014\n                 worse. O.K. Thank you very\u0014\n                 much. They'll treat you all right.\u0014\n\u0014\n            In a Scientology church service, the booklet\u0014\n            explains, \"we do not use prayers, attitudes of\u0014\n            piety, or threats of damnation. We use the facts,\u0014\n            the truths, the understandings that have been\u0014\n            discovered in the science of Scientology. We do\u0014\n            not read from the Bible (or the Koran or the\u0014\n            Torah or the Vedic Hymns, for that matter) and\u0014\n            say to people'Now this is something you have\u0014\n            got to believe.'\" Music is selected for the service\u0014\n            to be \"pleasant to listen to and not strongly\u0014\n            associated with the wrath of the gods or the\u0014\n            helpless dependence on the whim of an unknown\u0014\n            being.\" The sermon \"is ALWAYS on\u0014\n            Scientology and how it can be of use to those\u0014\n            present.\" A taped lecture by L. Ron Hubbard is\u0014\n            suggested as appropriate for this purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\n            In the December 1968 issue of the New\u0014\n            Zealand Methodist there appeared a discussion\u0014\n            between Sir James Hort, a minister in the Church\u0014\n            of Scientology, and three Protestant clergymen.\u0014\n            The following excerpt is instructive:\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Hort: The eighth dynamic is not\u0014\n                 inquired into. It is left to individual\u0014\n                 people to understand for\u0014\n                 themselves in time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Ramage [the Reverend I.C.E.]:\u0014\n                 Before you reach the eighth\u0014\n                 dynamic, you wouldn't feel that\u0014\n                 God has any part in your progress\u0014\n                 through the other stages?\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Hort: I think the answer is no. This\u0014\n                 is somewhere where the Christian\u0014\n                 religion and ours would differ.\u0014\n\u0014\n            In an earlier comment, Hort had observed\u0014\n            (regarding Scientology church services), \"if an\u0014\n            atheist or agnostic comes into Scientology, then\u0014\n            our service is there for him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n            [Part one of this article originally appeared in the\u0014\n            November 7, 1969, issue of Christianity Today. It was\u0014\n            continued in the November 21, 1969, issue.]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Founding Church of Scientology in\u0014\n            Washington, D.C., is in a rather shabby row\u0014\n            house. The living room has been converted into\u0014\n            an office and bookstore, the double size dining\u0014\n            room into a lecture hall, and upstairs bedrooms\u0014\n            into offices and classrooms. But despite the\u0014\n            architectural nonconformity, to say nothing of its\u0014\n            utter rejection of theological considerations,\u0014\n            Scientology insists on calling itself a church.\u0014\n            Moreover, it makes a special pitch to Christians\u0014\n            by attempting to harmonize the teachings of\u0014\n            founder L. Ron Hubbard with Scripture.\u0014\n            Forty-four pages of the booklet Scientology\u0014\n            and the Bible are set up in parallel columns with\u0014\n            this objective.

An organization of quack\u0014\n            psychologists who are exploiting the emotionally\u0014\n            and mentally distraught for financial gain?

S. Court of Appeals overturned a Federal\u0014\n            Court ruling supporting the Food and Drug\u0014\n            Administration \"until the Government can refute\u0014\n            the claim that Scientology is a religion \u0014\n            protected by the right of freedom of worship.\"\u0014\n            Judge J. Skelly Wright ruled, that until proven\u0014\n            otherwise, the Scientology practice of \"auditing\"\u0014\n            must be assumed to be comparable to the\u0014\n            Roman Catholic confession, and Scientology\u0014\n            literature comparable to Holy Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Articles exposing Scientology as a dangerous\u0014\n            fraud relate numerous examples of persons who\u0014\n            claim they were swindled by unscrupulous\u0014\n            Scientologists. The Saturday Evening Post tells\u0014\n            of a Florida millionaire who was fleeced out of\u0014\n            $28,000 in processing fees in less than two\u0014\n            years. According to Today's Health, a Los\u0014\n            Angeles housewife marched angrily into court\u0014\n            with the charge that she had spent $4,000 for\u0014\n            Scientology processing \"on assurance that it\u0014\n            would help her overcome frigidity.\" The ironical\u0014\n            outcome of her investment was that her husband\u0014\n            divorced her. And Alan Levy, in the November\u0014\n            15, 1968, issue of Life, tells of his reportorial\u0014\n            pilgrimage to Saint Hill (a sprawling English\u0014\n            manor, thirty-one miles from London, that\u0014\n            became Scientology's international headquarters\u0014\n            in 1959) to enroll in an advanced course\u0014\n            advertised at $390. Upon arrival he was\u0014\n            informed that the cost of tuition alone would be\u0014\n            $3,150, \"plus living expenses, payable in\u0014\n            advance.\" (Had the Scientologists smelled a rat?)\u0014\n\u0014\n            Founder L. Ron Hubbard's financial relationship\u0014\n            to the Scientology enterprise has come under\u0014\n            investigation. When world headquarters were\u0014\n            moved to Saint Hill ten years ago, Hubbard\u0014\n            imposed a 10 per cent assessment on all fees\u0014\n            collected by Scientology centers across the\u0014\n            world, payable to him. At that time the annual\u0014\n            take by the Founding Church alone reportedly\u0014\n            approached $200,000. In 1966 Hubbard\u0014\n            received a $240,000 fee from the movement for\u0014\n            \"the good will of his name\" (Time, August 23,\u0014\n            1968). Two years later he \"forgave\" the\u0014\n            organization a $13 million debt for \"services\u0014\n            rendered,\" a move described by Time as an\u0014\n            \"understandable act of' charity considering that\u0014\n            he has boasted to friends of having $7,000,000\u0014\n            stashed away in two numbered Swiss bank\u0014\n            accounts.\" When the organization ran into stormy\u0014\n            weather in the British Parliament, Hubbard\u0014\n            bailed out and headed for the Mediterranean on\u0014\n            his 3,300-ton yacht, with its blue-uniformed\u0014\n            crew of 200 sailors and students. There he\u0014\n            dabbles in oceanographic research while the\u0014\n            furor created by his controversial brainchild\u0014\n            continues unabated. In August, 1968, he cabled\u0014\n            Saint Hill, \"I have finished my Work. Now it's up\u0014\n            to others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            Even if we assume complete honesty and\u0014\n            sincerity on the part of its practitioners and\u0014\n            promoters, Scientology must be viewed as a\u0014\n            dangerous and menacing cult psychologically,\u0014\n            socially, physically, and spiritually.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Psychologically\u0014\n            Submitting to dianetic processing for the\u0014\n            treatment of deep-seated anxiety or emotional\u0014\n            disturbance is like going to the village butcher for\u0014\n            a gall bladder operation. Psychologists have\u0014\n            condemned the technique as \"amateurish and\u0014\n            potentially dangerous meddling with serious\u0014\n            mental problems\" (\u0014",

    "words": "By SHARON BEGLEY        Newsweek, 1/29/01\u0014\n\u0014\nHE BEGINS THE WAY HE BEGINS every meditation session, lighting candles\u0014\nand jasmine incense before .a lotus position. He focuses inward, \nwilling the essence he regards as his true self to break free from \nhis desires, worries and senses. There is a difference this time, \nthough. The young Tibetan Buddhist has a length of twine beside him \nand an IV in his left arm. As he approaches the transcendent peak of \nhis meditative state, he tugs on the twine. At the other end, in the \nnext room, Dr. Andrew Newberg feels the pull, and quickly injects a \nradioactive tracer into the IV line. Then Newberg whisks him into a \nbrain-imaging machine called SPECt -and the man's sense of unity with \nthe cosmos gets boiled down to a computer readout. A region at the \ntop rear of the brain which weaves sensory data into a feeling of \nwhere the self ends and the rest of the world begins looks like the \nvictim of one of California's rolling blackouts. Deprived of sensory \ninput by the man's inward concentration, this \"ori- entation area\" \ncannot do its job of finding the border between self and world. \"The \nbrain had no choice;' says Newberg. \"It perceived the self to be \nendless, as one\u0014\nwith all of creation. And this felt utterly real.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tension between science and religion is about to get tenser, for \nsome scientists have decided that religious experience is just too \nintriguing not to study. Neurologists jumped in first, finding a \nconnection between temporal lobe epilepsy and a sudden interest in \nreligion. AS V. S. Ramachandran of the University of California, San \nDiego, told a 1997 meeting, these patients, during seizures, \"say \nthey see God\" or feel \"a sudden sense of enlightenment.\" Now \nresearchers are looking at more-common varieties of religious \nexperience. Newberg and the late Dr. Eugene d'Aquili, both of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, have a name for this field: \nneuro-theology. In a book to be published in April, they con- clude \nthat spiritual experiences are the in- evitable outcome of brain \nwiring: \"The human brain has been genetically wired to encourage \nreligious beliefs:'\u0014\n\u0014\nEven plain old praying affects the brain in distinctive ways. In \nSPEcr scans of Franciscan nuns at prayer, the Penn team found a \nquieting of the orientation area, which gave the sisters a tangible \nsense of proximity to and merging with God. \"The absorption of the \nself into something larger [is] not the result of emotional \nfabrication or wishful thinking;' Newberg and d'Aquili write in \"Why \nGod Won't Go Away.\" It springs, instead, from neurological events, as \nwhen the orientation area goes dark.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeuro-theology also explores how ritual behavior elicits brain states \nthat bring on feelings ranging from mild community to deep spiritual \nunity. A 1997 study by Japan- ese researchers showed that repetitive \nrhythms can drive the brain's hypothala- mus, which can bring on \neither serenity or arousal. That may explain why incantatory hymns \ncan trigger a sense of quietude that believers interpret as spiritual \ntranquillity and bliss. In contrast, the fast rapturous dancing of \nSufi mystics causes hyper- arousal, scientists find, which can make \nparticipants feel as if they are channeling the energy of the \nuniverse. Although the inventors of rituals surely didn't know it at \nthe time, these rites manage to tap into the precise brain mechanisms \nthat tend to make believers interpret perceptions and feelings as \nevidence of God or, at least, transcendence. Rituals also tend to \nfocus the mind, blocking out sensory perceptions-including those that \nthe orientation area uses to figure out the boundaries of the sel \nThat's why even nonbelievers are often moved by religious ritual. \"As \nlong as our brain is wired as it is;' says Newberg, \"God will not go \naway:'\u0014\n\u0014\nIf brain wiring explains the feelings believers get from prayer and \nritual, are spiritual experiences mere creations of our neurons? \nNeuro-theology at least suggests that spiritual experiences are no \nmore meaningful than, say, the fear the brain is hard-wired to feel \nin re- sponse to a strange noise at night. Believers, of course, have \na retort: the brain's wiring may explain religious feelings-but who \ndo you think was the master electrician? .\u0014\n-\u0014",

When \nshe walked\u0014\n                     in, he hit her on the head with a mop handle.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Police said the man took the woman's purse and \ndrove\u0014\n                     away in her car, which was conveniently idling \nin the\u0014\n                     driveway.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But, in an act of contempt, or defiance, or \nmaybe simple\u0014\n                     defilement, he urinated into a coffee mug in the \nkitchen.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     That's what did him in.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Police took that mug of urine to the Virginia \nforensics lab, where technicians extracted a sample of DNA. They \ncompared that\u0014\n                     sample to a database containing the DNA of more \nthan 135,000 felons and came up with a match.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Richmond Detective Brian Russell said on Jan. \n30, police arrested Jelani Omar Johnson, 20, a resident of the \nWorthington\u0014\n                     Farms area of South Side. He has been charged \nwith breaking and entering, grand larceny and robbery in connection \nwith the\u0014\n                     case.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Johnson's DNA was on file with the state lab \nbecause he had been convicted of auto theft and sentenced to one year \nin prison\u0014\n                     in October 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The burglary of the 75-year-old woman's home was \nall too typical, and preventing it would have been as simple as \nturning a\u0014\n                     key. The burglar got into the home of a \ntrusting, perhaps naive victim who made it easy, and he stole items \nthat were easy to\u0014\n                     get.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The only things atypical were that the victim \nwas there, and the suspect was caught - something that happens in \nonly about\u0014\n                     one-third of burglaries.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                         . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The violation and invasion the victim suffered \nthat Tuesday morning in December are familiar to thousands of \nRichmond area\u0014\n                     residents. That's because although violent \ncrimes and attempts to lessen their impacts have been much in the \nnews during the\u0014\n                     past decade, it is burglaries and their \nrelatives of larceny and vandalism that touch more lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     One week before Johnson was arrested, on Jan. \n23, police charged Michael Steven Boyd, 25, who lives just outside \nWorthington\u0014\n                     Farms. Police accused Boyd of breaking and \nentering at a home on Ullswater Avenue on Jan. 9, just a short stroll \nfrom his\u0014\n                     house, and three counts of grand larceny.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Russell said Boyd was arrested after he tried to \ncash checks that he is accused of taking during the burglary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Like Johnson, Boyd also had run afoul of the \nlaw. He was convicted in 1994 of five burglaries, seven grand \nlarcenies and four\u0014\n                     charges involving forged checks. His probation \nwas revoked twice, and he was sentenced in May 1997 to a year in \nprison for\u0014\n                     possession of a firearm by a felon.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Russell said police still are investigating \npossible connections between Johnson and Boyd and more than a dozen \nburglaries in\u0014\n                     the Worthington Farms area of South Richmond. \nOne thing is certain: The burglaries stopped after police searched \nJohnson's\u0014\n                     home Jan. 16.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The DNA test that led to Johnson's arrest has \nbecome almost routine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In the decade since the state lab has been using \nits DNA database to track down criminals, investigators have \nidentified suspects\u0014\n                     in 278 cases.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Last year, they identified 178 of them, or 64 \npercent.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Paul B. Ferrara, director of the Virginia \nDivision of Forensic Science, said the pace of solving crimes by \nusing DNA evidence will\u0014\n                     continue to grow. He said the lab is getting \nabout one match a day and expects about 300 by the end of the year.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Since 1990, the lab has helped nab more \nnon-violent offenders than any other single group. Of the 278 cases \nso far, 123 have\u0014\n                     been in property crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     People think fingerprints are the Rosetta stone \nto solving break-ins. The problem is, fingerprints are hard to get, \nand it can be\u0014\n                     almost impossible to separate the prints of the \nresidents from those of the criminal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But the bad guys often leave DNA, Russell said. \nSome eat sandwiches or munch an apple. Some cut themselves while \nbreaking\u0014\n                     in. Some leave hairs, others use the bathroom.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Technicians then can compare the DNA in those \nsamples with the DNA already catalogued in the state's computers. If \nthere's a\u0014\n                     match, the police have their man.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"It makes a relatively easy case,\" Ferrara said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                         . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Advances in science and technology have made the \nrapid escalation in DNA processing possible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     One of the most famous DNA cases in U.S. history \nwas that of Timothy W. Spencer. He was the rapist and murderer known \nas\u0014\n                     \"the South Side Strangler\" who killed two women \nin Richmond, another in Arlington County, and a 15-year-old girl in\u0014\n                     Chesterfield County in 1987.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The DNA analysis in Spencer's case took 10 weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     It now takes three days.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The hits are so routine, \"it's become sort of \nho-hum,\" Ferrara said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The early cases made by the lab were almost \nexclusively in violent crimes. The first cold case \"hit\" - meaning \nthere was no\u0014\n                     suspect - occurred in a burglary in October \n1998. There were two in February 1999, one in March 1999 and three in \nApril. The\u0014\n                     numbers have been piling up ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Russell and other experts, including burglars \nthemselves, said Johnson and Boyd have at least one thing in common \nwith many\u0014\n                     suspects in residential burglaries: They live \nnear the victims.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Investigators often find that burglars don't \npick their victims at random. They're familiar with the neighborhood \nand often know\u0014\n                     enough about the daily routine of the victim to \nensure that they won't get caught in the act.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     One burglar said he had met behind bars a fellow \nburglar who used to drive a trash truck. That burglar had figured out \nwhen\u0014\n                     people were home and when they weren't. \"He was \nin the neighborhood twice a week picking up trash,\" the man said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Maj. Jim Bourque of the Chesterfield County \nPolice Department said thieves typically \"are from around the \nneighborhood or\u0014\n                     have some nexus to the neighborhood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Russell said most burglars take things that are \neasy to take such as Play Stations, electronic equipment, television \nsets -\u0014\n                     \"top-dollar items.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     They also take things that are easily carried \naway. \"Very seldom do we run across where people will pull a car up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Police in South Richmond get about five reports \na month of break-ins in which the thieves take food such as steaks \nfrom the\u0014\n                     freezer. \"Some lady had her macaroni and cheese \nstolen.\" The term on police reports is \"consumable goods.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Jewelry is very easy to steal and very hard to \nrecover because it is difficult to identify, Russell said. A ring \nmight seem to be\u0014\n                     unique, but if the stones are removed and sold \nseparately, it is all but impossible to identify.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Dr. Tod Burke, associate professor of criminal \njustice at Radford University and a former Maryland police officer, \nsuggested that\u0014\n                     people should be a little less open.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"On your answering machine, don't tell people \nyou will be away. Don't leave keys in obvious places - under a plant. \nHave key\u0014\n                     control. Know who has a copy of it. Don't stop \nthe newspaper or mail. Have a neighbor pick it up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                         . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Suggestions for protecting personal property are \nlegion, but two keep popping up: good neighbors and any dog.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The convicted burglar was disdainful of alarm \nsystems. \"If a man put it in, a man can break it,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But dogs are another animal. It doesn't have to \nbe a vicious dog or even big; just loud. \"If I wanted to break into \nsomebody's\u0014\n                     house, the dog's barking and carrying on, the \nneighbors will look out. . . . Bark! bark! bark! Why would you want \nto go there?\" he\u0014\n                     said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"The only way you can [quiet] a dog is shoot it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Russell said alarm systems are good and so are \ndogs. But \"the thing that works better than an alarm system is \nknowing who your\u0014\n                     neighbors are. The Mrs. Kravitz type, like on \n'Bewitched,' there's nothing wrong with that.\" Gladys Kravitz was the \nnosy neighbor\u0014\n                     who always seemed to know what was going on \nacross the street at the home of Darrin and Samantha Stephens in the \nold\u0014\n                     television series.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Burke agreed. \"Get a dog. It doesn't have to be \na big dog. Any little yapper will do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Most important are neighbors, relying on \ncommunity watch and any of those telephone trees. Communication with \nneighbors is\u0014\n                     critical. You can take back your own \nneighborhood by being observant and reporting crimes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Know your neighbors,\" Bourque said. \"That's the \nbiggy. Those thieves we catch early on are because we got a tip.\"\u0014",

They have an understanding among \nthemselves as to\u0014\n                           the time and place. This is often done by \nthe first one arriving\u0014\n                           breaking boughs from the trees and bending \nthem in the\u0014\n                           direction of the selected spot. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"After arriving and greeting one another, men \nand women sat in groups\u0014\n                      together. Then there was \"preachingby the \nbrethren, then praying and\u0014\n                      singing all around until they generally feel \nquite happy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The speaker rises \"and talks very slowly, until \nfeeling the spirit, he grows\u0014\n                      excited, and in a short time there fall to the \nground 20 or 30 men and\u0014\n                      women under its influence. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The slave forgets all his sufferings,\" \nRandolph summed up, \"except to\u0014\n                      remind others of the trials during the past \nweek, exclaiming, 'Thank God, I\u0014\n                      shall not live here always!' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is a remarkable event not merely because of \nthe risks incurred (200\u0014\n                      lashes of the whip often awaited those caught \nat such a meeting) but\u0014\n                      because of the hurdles overcome merely to \narrive at this moment. For\u0014\n                      decades all manner of people and circumstances \nconspired against\u0014\n                      African Americans even hearing the gospel, let \nalone responding to it in\u0014\n                      freedom and joy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      No time for religion\u0014\n                      The plantation work regimen gave slaves little \nleisure time for religious\u0014\n                      instruction. Some masters required slaves to \nwork even on Sunday. Even\u0014\n                      with the day off, many slaves needed to tend \ntheir own gardens, which\u0014\n                      supplemented their income and diet (others \nopted to socialize, to dance, or\u0014\n                      get drunk). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the largest obstacles was sheer \nprejudice. Many masters believed\u0014\n                      Africans were too \"brutish\" to comprehend the \ngospel; others doubted\u0014\n                      Africans had souls. Anglican missionary to \nSouth Carolina Francis Le Jau\u0014\n                      reported in 1709, \"Many masters can't be \npersuaded that Negroes and\u0014\n                      Indians are otherwise than Beasts, and use them \nlike such.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such thinking was combated by men like Puritan \nCotton Mather, who, in his\u0014\n                      tract The Negro Christianized, pleaded with \nowners to treat their \"servants\"\u0014\n                      as men, not brutes: \"Thou shalt love thy \nneighbor as thy self. Man, thy Negro\u0014\n                      is thy neighbor.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Other masters believed conversion would make \nslaves \"saucy,\" since they\u0014\n                      would begin to think of themselves equal to \nwhites. According to John\u0014\n                      Bragg, a Virginia minister, slave owners agreed \nthat conversion would\u0014\n                      result in the slaves \"being and becoming worse \nslaves when Christians.\"\u0014\n                      Some even believed \"A slave is ten times worse \nwhen a Christian than in\u0014\n                      his state of paganism.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There were legal complications as well. Many \nmasters in colonial America\u0014\n                      believed if a slave was baptized that, \n\"according to the laws of the British\u0014\n                      nation, and the canons of the church,\" he must \nbe freed. Colonial\u0014\n                      legislatures sought to clear up this matter, \nand by 1706 at least six had\u0014\n                      passed acts denying that baptism altered the \ncondition of a slave \"as to his\u0014\n                      bondage or freedom.\" It wasn't just economics \nbut a twinge of Christian\u0014\n                      conscience that prompted the legislation. As \nVirginia's law put it, it was\u0014\n                      passed so that masters, \"freed from this doubt, \nmay more carefully\u0014\n                      endeavor the propagation of Christianity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But clergy were in short supply even for whites \nin the eighteenth-century\u0014\n                      South. In 1701 Virginia, for example, only half \nof the forty-some parishes\u0014\n                      containing 40,000 people were supplied with \nclergy. And regarding white\u0014\n                      settlers in Georgia, one missionary said, \"They \nseem in general to have but\u0014\n                      very little more knowledge of a Savior than the \naboriginal natives.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, there were cultural obstacles. In 1701 \nthe Society for the\u0014\n                      Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was \nformed, and one of its\u0014\n                      purposes was to seek the conversion of slaves \nin colonial America. As an\u0014\n                      arm of the Church of England, however, it was \nless than effective with the\u0014\n                      \"target\" population. Le Jau described his \nrefined and rational method of\u0014\n                      teaching African Americans: \"We begin and end \nour particular assembly\u0014\n                      with the collect.I teach them the Creed, the \nLord's Prayer, and the\u0014\n                      Commandments. I explain some portion of the \ncatechism.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With culture, prejudice, and injustice joining \nforces, few slaves were\u0014\n                      converted. As one missionary reported in 1779 \nabout conditions in South\u0014\n                      Carolina: \"The Negroes of that country, a few \nonly excepted, are to this day\u0014\n                      as great strangers to Christianity and as much \nunder the influence of pagan\u0014\n                      darkness, idolatry, and superstition as they \nwere at their first arrival from\u0014\n                      Africa.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It would, it seemed, take a miracle to turn \nthings around. And a miracle is\u0014\n                      just what America had already begun to \nexperience. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Black awakening\u0014\n                      In 1733, during a local revival instigated by \nhis preaching, Jonathan\u0014\n                      Edwards noted, \"There are several Negroes \nwhoappear to have been\u0014\n                      truly born again in the late remarkable \nseason.\" When the Great Awakening\u0014\n                      arrived in fullwith shouts and groans and \nspiritual ecstasyblacks began\u0014\n                      to swell the crowds coming to hear revival \npreachers. In Philadelphia,\u0014\n                      George Whitefield reported, \"Nearly 50 Negroes \ncame to give me thanks\u0014\n                      for what God had done to their souls.\" In the \nlate 1740s, Presbyterian\u0014\n                      Samuel Davies said he ministered to seven \ncongregations in Virginia in\u0014\n                      which \"more than 1,000 Negroes\" had \nparticipated in his services. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Presbyterian theology and Anglican liturgy, \nhowever, held little appeal to\u0014\n                      most blacks. Not until Methodists and Baptists \narrivedwith their\u0014\n                      emphasis on conversion as a spiritual \nexperiencedid black Christianity\u0014\n                      begin to take off. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      John Thompson, who was born a Maryland slave in \n1812, said he and his\u0014\n                      fellow slaves \"could understand but little that \nwas said\" in the Episcopal\u0014\n                      service his owner required them to attend. But \nwhen \"the Methodist religion\u0014\n                      was brought among usit brought glad tidings to \nthe poor bondsman.\" It\u0014\n                      spread from plantation to plantation, he said, \nand \"there were few who did\u0014\n                      not experience religion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Baptists and Methodists prized spiritual \nvitality more than education in\u0014\n                      clergy, so if a converted African American \nshowed a gift for preaching, he\u0014\n                      was encouraged to preach, even to unconverted \nwhites. Thus arose the\u0014\n                      earliest black preachers of repute, men with \nnames like \"Black Harry\"\u0014\n                      Hosier, Josiah Bishop, \"Old Captain,\" and \n\"Uncle\" Jack. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Great Awakening, then, planted the seed of \na more experiential type of\u0014\n                      Christianity that blossomed suddenly late in \nthe eighteenth century. Black\u0014\n                      Methodism in the U. S. grew from 3,800 in 1786 \nto nearly 32,000 by 1809.\u0014\n                      Membership in black Baptist congregations \nincreased as well, from 18,000\u0014\n                      in 1793 to 40,000 in 1813. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Southern whites were not necessarily \ncomfortable with this. Though a few\u0014\n                      masters argued that slaves \"do better for their \nmasters' profit than formerly,\u0014\n                      for they are taught to serve out of Christian \nlove and duty,\" others kept their\u0014\n                      slaves distant from the Christian preaching. \nFrancis Henderson, a fugitive\u0014\n                      slave, said his master had refused him \npermission to attend a Methodist\u0014\n                      church saying, \"You shan't go to that \nchurchthey'll put the devil in you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And Francis Asbury, the famous Methodist \nbishop, complained, \"We are\u0014\n                      defrauded of great numbers by the pains that \nare taken to keep the blacks\u0014\n                      from us.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By 1820, one white Presbyterian minister, \nCharles C. Jones, could still\u0014\n                      moan, \"But a minority of the Negroes, and that \na small one, attended\u0014\n                      regularly the house of God, andtheir religious \ninstruction was extensively\u0014\n                      and most seriously neglected.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A slave conspiracy in 1822 and a revolt in 1831 \ndidn't help matters. The\u0014\n                      conspiracy was led by Denmark Vesey who, as one \nco-conspirator\u0014\n                      confessed, \"read in the Bible where God \ncommanded that all [whites]\u0014\n                      should be cut off, both men, women, and \nchildren, and said it was no sin for\u0014\n                      us to do so, for the Lord commanded us to do \nit.\" The slave revolt, the\u0014\n                      bloodiest in U.S. history, in Southampton, \nVirginia, was led by Nat Turner, a\u0014\n                      prophet and preacher, who said he had been \ndirected to act by God (see\u0014\n                      \"God's Avenging Scourge,\" p. 28). After such \nincidents, masters were even\u0014\n                      more reluctant to let blacks gather alone for \nany reason. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, the southern conscience, pricked by \nnorthern abolitionist agitation,\u0014\n                      prompted increasingly more slave owners to take \nthe Great Commission\u0014\n                      seriously. Slave owners wanted to prove that \nslaveholding could be a\u0014\n                      positive good for both owners and slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1829, the South Carolina Methodist \nConference appointed William\u0014\n                      Capers to superintend a special department for \nplantation missionsthe\u0014\n                      first official and concerted effort of the \nsort. Four years later, Charles Jones\u0014\n                      began a ministry to evangelize slaves and to \nconvince others to do\u0014\n                      likewise. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jones, called \"the apostle to the negro slaves\" \nwas, in fact, a slave owner.\u0014\n                      He came from a distinguished Georgia family and \neventually owned three\u0014\n                      plantations and 129 slaves. A man with one \ncompassionate eye and\u0014\n                      another fierce with purpose, Jones urged his \nsouthern brethren to \"look to\u0014\n                      home\" first. \"The religious instruction of our \nservants is a duty,\" he wrote in\u0014\n                      1834. \"Any man with a conscience may be made to \nfeel it. It can be\u0014\n                      discharged. It must be dischargedas speedily \nas possible.\" This would\u0014\n                      not only win the approval of God and their own \nconsciences, he argued, but\u0014\n                      also the respect of the North. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After the major denominationsMethodist, \nPresbyterian, and\u0014\n                      Baptistsplit over slavery, efforts to \nevangelize slaves accelerated.\u0014\n                      Southern whites were eager to show northerners \nthat a gentle, Christian\u0014\n                      societyslave and freecould flourish in the \nSouth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      According to some southerners they succeeded: \nby 1845, one southern\u0014\n                      churchman crowed that the slave mission \"is the \ncrowning glory of our\u0014\n                      church.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Failure of white Christianity\u0014\n                      The gospel presented to slaves by white owners, \nhowever, was only a\u0014\n                      partial gospel. The message of salvation by \ngrace, the joy of faith, and the\u0014\n                      hope of heaven were all there, but many other \nteachings were missing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      House servants often sneered and laughed among \nthemselves when\u0014\n                      summoned to family prayers because the master \nor mistress would read,\u0014\n                      \"Servants obey your masters,\" but neglect \npassages that said, \"Break\u0014\n                      every yoke and let the oppressed go free.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One white evangelist to slaves, John Dixon \nLong, admitted his frustration:\u0014\n                      \"They hear ministers denouncing them for \nstealing the white man's grain,\u0014\n                      but as they never hear the white man denounced \nfor holding them in\u0014\n                      bondage, pocketing their wages, or selling \ntheir wives and children to the\u0014\n                      brutal traders of the far South; they naturally \nsuspect the Gospel to be a\u0014\n                      cheat and believe the preachers and slaveholder \n[are] in a conspiracy\u0014\n                      against them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The institutional church, in both the North and \nSouth, had long before\u0014\n                      deserted the slaveseven the Methodists, who \nearly on insisted that slave\u0014\n                      owners, upon their conversion, free their \nslaves. But by 1804, the General\u0014\n                      Conference agreed to let Methodist societies in \nthe Carolinas, Georgia,\u0014\n                      and Tennessee allow their members to buy and \nsell slaves. And in 1808,\u0014\n                      the annual conference of the Methodist church \nauthorized each conference\u0014\n                      to determine its own regulations about \nslaveholding. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After Denmark Vesey and his fellow conspirators \n(many of whom were\u0014\n                      Methodists) were arrested, southern clergy felt \nconstrained by public\u0014\n                      opinion to affirm the racial status quo. \nBaptists and Episcopalians in\u0014\n                      Charleston denied any intention of interfering \nwith slavery. By the early\u0014\n                      1800s, the southern churches had completely \nfolded on the issue. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In instance after instance recorded in \ncountless slave narratives, the\u0014\n                      conversion of masters made matters worse for \nslaves. As ex-slave Mrs.\u0014\n                      Joseph Smith explained it, the non-religious \nowner simply gave slaves\u0014\n                      Sundays off and ignored them the entire day. \nBut Christian owners, eager\u0014\n                      for the sanctification of their charges, could \nnot let Sundays pass without\u0014\n                      due vigilance. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Smith explained, \"Now, everybody that has \ngot common sense knows\u0014\n                      that Sunday is a day of rest. And if you do the \nleast thing in the world they\u0014\n                      [the owners] don't like; they will mark it down \nagainst you, and Monday you\u0014\n                      have got to take a whipping.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some didn't wait until Monday. One slave \nreported that his master served\u0014\n                      him Communion at church in the morning and \nwhipped him in the afternoon\u0014\n                      for returning to the plantation a few minutes \nlate. Susan Boggs recalled the\u0014\n                      day of her baptism: \"The man that baptized me \nhad a colored woman tied\u0014\n                      up in his yard to whip when he got home. We \nhad to sit and hear him\u0014\n                      preach, and [the woman's] mother was in church \nhearing him preach.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is not difficult to see why Frederick \nDouglass called slaveholding piety \"a\u0014\n                      cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither \nprinciples of right action nor\u0014\n                      bowels of compassion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Experiencing the real\u0014\n                      It is amazing that under these circumstances \nany slaves found the Christian\u0014\n                      message convincing. And yet blacks clearly saw \nthe differencea\u0014\n                      difference white owners were utterly blind \ntobetween the message of the\u0014\n                      Bible and the slaveholding culture in which it \nwas taking root. When William\u0014\n                      Craft's supposedly Christian master sold his \naged parents because they\u0014\n                      were no longer an economic asset, Craft said he \nfelt \"a thorough hatred,\u0014\n                      not for Christianity, but for slaveholding \npiety.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Slaves, when hearing the Christian message, \nwere struck by something\u0014\n                      that transcended their culture. Many of them \ndescribed how they were\u0014\n                      seized by the Spirit, struck dead (so to \nspeak), and raised to a new life.\u0014\n                      Such conversions took place in the fields, in \nthe woods, at camp meetings,\u0014\n                      in the slave quarters, or at services conducted \nby the blacks themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      John Jasper, a famous black preacher in \nRichmond, for example, was\u0014\n                      converted while at work as a stemmer in a \ntobacco factory. He\u0014\n                      remembered that when \"de light broke; I was \nlight as a feather; my feet was\u0014\n                      on de mount'n; salvation rol'd like a flood \nthru my soul, an' I felt as if I could\u0014\n                      knock off de fact'ry roof wid my shouts.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Josiah Henson said he was \"transported with \ndelicious joy\" when he heard\u0014\n                      a sermon from the Book of Hebrews that said \nChrist tasted death \"for every\u0014\n                      man.\" He exclaimed, \"O the blessedness and \nsweetness of feeling that I\u0014\n                      was loved!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such experiences were so real that nothing \nmasters did or said could\u0014\n                      shake their Christian confidence. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course, this experience of faith was not \nsustained by the \"family prayers\"\u0014\n                      led by the master or mistress, or the formal \nworship at which both blacks\u0014\n                      and whites gathered on Sundays. Such formats \nwere heavily proscribed by\u0014\n                      the sensibilities and fear of white Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In such settings, gifted blacks were sometimes \nallowed to preach. They\u0014\n                      were usually limited to assisting white \npreachers, which included the\u0014\n                      obligatory admonition at the end of the service \nfor slaves to pay attention to\u0014\n                      the teachings of the white preacher. One \nex-slave said, \"We had some\u0014\n                      nigger preachers but they would say, 'Obey your \nmistress and master.' They\u0014\n                      didn't know nothing else to say.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even when blacks met alone, though, preachers \nhad to be circumspect. As\u0014\n                      one put it, \"If a colored preacher or \nintelligent free Negro gains the ill-will of\u0014\n                      a malicious slave, all the latter has to do is \nto report that said preacher had\u0014\n                      attempted to persuade him to 'rise' or to run \naway; and the poor fellow's life\u0014\n                      may pay the forfeit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The Christianity that finally took\u0014\n                       hold of black souls, that grew and\u0014\n                       blossomed in its own distinct way,\u0014\n                       was a different thing altogether\u0014\n                       than whites had imagined..\u0014\n                                                      Some solved the \ndilemma by\u0014\n                                                      preaching, when \nunder the master's\u0014\n                                                      eye, \n\"Niggersiffen they obeys the\u0014\n                                                      master they \ngoes to Heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then, when alone with his black brothers and \nsisters, he would add, \"iffen\u0014\n                      they keeps praying, the Lord will set 'em \nfree.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Invisible church\u0014\n                      Yet it wasn't just the message that was chained \nby the circumstances, but\u0014\n                      the very style of worship blacks yearned to \nexpress. Sarah Fitzpatrick, an\u0014\n                      Alabama slave, noted, \"White fo'ks have deir \nservice in de mornin', an'\u0014\n                      niggers have deirs in de evenin', a'ter dey \nclean up, wash de dishes, an'\u0014\n                      look a'ter eve'thing.

Ex-slave Charlotte Martin, for example, \nsaid her oldest brother was\u0014\n                      whipped to death for secreting off to a worship \nservice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lucretia Alexander explained that after \nenduring the white preacher's\u0014\n                      sermon (\"Serve your masters. Don't steal your \nmaster's turkey.Do\u0014\n                      whatsoever your master tells you do to\"), her \nfather would hold worship\u0014\n                      secretly in one of the slave quarters. \"That \nwould be when they would want a\u0014\n                      real meetin' with some real preachin'. They \nused to sing their songs in a\u0014\n                      whisper and pray in a whisper.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To get a little distance between themselves and \ntheir masters, slaves would\u0014\n                      often meet in woods, gullies, ravines, and \nthickets, aptly called \"hush\u0014\n                      harbors.\" Kalvin Woods recalled singing and \npraying with other slaves,\u0014\n                      huddled behind quilts and rags, hung \"in the \nform of a little room\" and\u0014\n                      wetted \"to keep the sound of their voices from \npenetrating the air.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On one Louisiana plantation, slaves would steal \noff into the woods and\u0014\n                      \"form a circle on their knees around the \nspeaker, who would also be on his\u0014\n                      knees. He would bend forward and speak into or \nover a vessel of water to\u0014\n                      drown the sound. If anyone became animated and \ncried out, the others\u0014\n                      would quickly stop the noise by placing their \nhands over the offender's\u0014\n                      mouth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such secrecy was not required everywhere, and \nin many places and upon a\u0014\n                      variety of occasionsSunday worship, prayer \nmeetings, baptisms, and\u0014\n                      revivalsblacks worshiped alone and in full \nvoice. As one ex-slave put it,\u0014\n                      referring to camp meetings: \"Mostly we had \nwhite preachers, but when we\u0014\n                      had a black preacher, that was heaven.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Frederick Law Olmsted described one New Orleans \nservice he attended in\u0014\n                      1860. A man sitting next to him \"soon began to \nrespond aloud to the\u0014\n                      sentiments of the preacher, in such words as \nthese: 'Oh yes!' and similar\u0014\n                      expressions could be heard from all parts of \nthe house whenever the\u0014\n                      speaker's voice was unusually solemn, or his \nlanguage and manner\u0014\n                      eloquent or excited.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Olmstead also noted \"shouts, and groans, and \nterrific shrieks, and\u0014\n                      indescribable expressions of ecstasyof \npleasure or agonyand even\u0014\n                      stamping, jumping, and clapping hands were \nadded.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He then focused on one worshiper: \"The preacher \nwas drawing his sermon\u0014\n                      to a closewhen a small old womansuddenly \nrose, and began dancing\u0014\n                      and clapping her hands; at first with slow \nmeasured movement, and then\u0014\n                      with increasing rapidity, at the same time \nbeginning to shout 'Ha! Ha!'her\u0014\n                      head thrown back and rolling from one side to \nthe other. Gradually her shout\u0014\n                      became indistinct; she threw her arms wildly \nabout instead of clapping her\u0014\n                      hands, fell back into the arms of her \ncompanions, then threw herself forward\u0014\n                      and embraced those before her, then tossed \nherself from side to side,\u0014\n                      gasping and finally sunk to the floor, where \nshe remainedkicking, as if\u0014\n                      acting a death struggle.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps it was indeed a death strugglewith an \noppressive culture that\u0014\n                      sought to wring life, physical and spiritual, \nout of her. But if so, it was one\u0014\n                      that moved toward resurrection. One ex-slave \npreacher talked about the\u0014\n                      effect of such services: \"The old meeting house \ncaught on fire. The spirit\u0014\n                      was there. Every heart was beating in unison as \nwe turned our minds to\u0014\n                      God to tell him our sorrows here below. God saw \nour need and came to\u0014\n                      us.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many black preachers didn't know a letter of \nthe Bible or how to spell the\u0014\n                      name of Christ. \"But when they opened their \nmouths,\" said one ex-slave,\u0014\n                      \"they were filled, and the plan of salvation \nwas explained in a way that all\u0014\n                      could receive it.\" Sometimes the exhorter \nmerely related his conversion\u0014\n                      experience, or how God had comforted him in \ntimes of distress. When the\u0014\n                      preacher was exhausted, he said, the faces of \nthe listeners \"showed that\u0014\n                      their souls had been refreshed and that it had \nbeen 'good for them to be\u0014\n                      there.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Confident faith\u0014\n                      By the time the guns of Fort Sumter pounded \nforth in 1860, the number of\u0014\n                      black Christians below the Mason-Dixon line had \ngrown to an astounding\u0014\n                      half-million, not counting the thousands who \nparticipated secret slave\u0014\n                      worship. The numbers were uneven across the \nSouth: black Christians\u0014\n                      constituted 20 percent of the black population \nin South Carolina, but only\u0014\n                      about 10 percent in Virginia. In some cities, \nthere were black\u0014\n                      congregations that numbered in the thousands. \nAll in all, this was about\u0014\n                      double the number of black Christians from the \nearly 1800s, and multiples\u0014\n                      more than in the early 1700s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That blacks accepted the Christian gospel is \nremarkable in itself,\u0014\n                      considering the stumbling blocks thrown in \ntheir way. Certainly some of the\u0014\n                      success must be credited to white \nmissionariesboth slave owners and\u0014\n                      abolitionistswho insisted that slaves hear at \nleast the rudiments of the\u0014\n                      Christian message. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the Christianity that finally took hold of \nblack souls, that grew and\u0014\n                      blossomed in its own distinct way, and that \ncomforted and gave hope to a\u0014\n                      sorely oppressed people, was a different thing \naltogether than what whites\u0014\n                      had imagined. It was in some sense created and \nnurtured by blacks\u0014\n                      themselves, who refused to let whites frame \ntheir faith. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Instead they discovered for themselves the \nbiblical message, as historian\u0014\n                      Arnold Toynbee put it, \"that Jesus was a \nprophet who came into the world\u0014\n                      not to confirm the mighty in their seats but to \nexalt the humble and the\u0014\n                      meek.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This not only gave blacks hope but a confidence \nwhites recognized and\u0014\n                      feared. Francis Henderson described her \nconversion this way: \"I had\u0014\n                      recently joined the Methodist Church, and from \nthe sermons I heard, I felt\u0014\n                      that God had made all men free and equal, and \nthat I ought not be a\u0014\n                      slavebut even then, that I ought not to be \nabused. From this time I was not\u0014\n                      punished. I think my master became afraid of \nme.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Black boldness was due in part to their belief \nin God's special concern for\u0014\n                      the poor. As ex-slave Jacob Stoyer put it, \"God \nwould somehow do more\u0014\n                      for the oppressed Negroes than he would \nordinarily for any other people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But blacks were also bolstered by their trust \nin a coming judgment at which\u0014\n                      slaveholders would receive recompense. Moses \nGrandy remembered how\u0014\n                      during violent thunderstorms whites hid between \ntheir feather beds,\u0014\n                      whereas slaves went outside and, lifting up \ntheir hands, thanked God that\u0014\n                      judgment day was coming at last.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It was, in the end, a confidence in a God who \nwould set things right, either in\u0014\n                      this age or in the age to come. At age 90, Jane \nSimpson recalled, \"I used\u0014\n                      to hear old slaves pray and ask God when would \nde bottom rail be de top\u0014\n                      rail, and I wondered what on earth, dey talkin' \nabout. Dey was talkin' about\u0014\n                      when dey goin' to get from under bondage. \n'Course I know now.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mark Galli is the editor of CHRISTIAN HISTORY. \nTo prepare this article, he relied upon\u0014\n                      Albert J. Raboteau's Slave Religion: The \nInvisible Institution (Oxford, 1978) and Milton\u0014\n                      Sernett's Black Religion and American \nEvangelicalism (Scarecrow, 1975). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Resources:\u0014\n                      Albert Raboteau's Slave Religion: The Invisible \nInstitution in the Antebellum South is the\u0014\n                      benchmark work on slave Christianity. Now more \nthan 20 years old, it's well-written,\u0014\n                      comprehensive, and a classic. If you're going \nto get any book on the subject, get this\u0014\n                      one. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The other book Mark Galli used extensively in \nhis research for this article, Milton\u0014\n                      Sernett's Black Religion and American \nEvangelicalism: White Protestants, Plantation\u0014\n                      Missions and the Flowering of Negro \nChristianity, 1787-1865, is now out of print. But\u0014\n                      booksellers like Amazon.com can probably still \ntrack down a used copy of this important\u0014\n                      work. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      More recently, Raboteau authored A Fire in the \nBones: Reflections on African-American\u0014\n                      Religious History. His book African-American \nReligion, part of Oxford University Press's\u0014\n                      \"Religion in American Life\" series, was just \nreleased in March 1999. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Milton Sernett's Afro-American Religious \nHistory: A Documentary Witness is the best\u0014\n                      collection of primary source material on the \nsubject.

It was a promotional piece urging \nus to send money, not missionaries, to foreign\u0014\ncountries. The rationale was clear: \"In most cases, sending just a \nportion of our surplus$50-$100 each monthwill provide support for \none full-time national worker.\u0014\n                                           \u0014\nThe typical cost to send an American missionary family overseas is \nover $50,000 a\u0014\n yearthe same cost to support 50 or more national workers. Think of \nwhat that money could\u0014\n                                           do for the Kingdom of God!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Admittedly, this rationale is appealing. \nNationals have the\u0014\n                      language and the cultureand they cost so much \nless. More\u0014\n                      than 140 missions organizations are now built \non the premise\u0014\n                      of gathering and sending money, not people. \nPartners\u0014\n                      International, the largest of the \nmoney-gathering agencies,\u0014\n                      currently supports 3,300 full-time workers in \nover 50\u0014\n                      countries. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As sensible and appealing as this strategy may \nsound,\u0014\n                      however, more and more mission observers are \npointing to\u0014\n                      hazards inherent in \"just supporting \nnationals.\" These\u0014\n                      hazards, ironically, pose the greatest threat \nto the nationals\u0014\n                      themselves. Jerry Rankin, president of the \nInternational\u0014\n                      Mission Board, Southern Baptist Convention, \nputs it this way:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           One thing inevitably occurs when North\u0014\n                           Americans subsidize the work of churches\u0014\n                           and pastors on the mission field: potential\u0014\n                           growth is stalled because of a mind-set \nthat\u0014\n                           it can't be done unless an overseas\u0014\n                           benefactor provides the funds. Jealousy\u0014\n                           often develops among the pastors and\u0014\n                           churches who don't receive assistance\u0014\n                           toward those who develop a pipeline of\u0014\n                           support from the United States. In the\u0014\n                           long-term, support breeds resentment,\u0014\n                           especially if the support is not sustained\u0014\n                           indefinitely, because it creates a\u0014\n                           patronizing dependency. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When giving is taking\u0014\n                      In other words, churches and church leaders \nthat secure a\u0014\n                      financial pipeline to the United States soon \nbecome mired in\u0014\n                      an ecclesiastical welfare state, because the \nsend-money\u0014\n                      approach, rather than strengthening the souls \nof national\u0014\n                      churches, keeps congregations from becoming \nself-governing\u0014\n                      and self-supporting. The recipients often \nsuffer in the following\u0014\n                      ways: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Believers learn to depend neither on God \nnor on\u0014\n                           themselves. Because they have no need to \ngive\u0014\n                           sacrificially of their own resources \n(however meager\u0014\n                           they may be), they never gain a sense of \nownership.\u0014\n                           This postpones the day of true \nindigenization. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Leaders become preoccupied with raising \nNorth\u0014\n                           American funds. On a trip I took to India, \nI was\u0014\n                           overwhelmed by the many church leaders who\u0014\n                           \"worked\" me for a dollar connection. Such \na ministry\u0014\n                           orientation inevitably weakens faith, \ncorrupts pure\u0014\n                           motives, and compromises leadership \nintegrity. Also,\u0014\n                           leaders who can't get connected to the \npipeline\u0014\n                           become demoralized. The work can't be done \nwithout\u0014\n                           outside assistance, so why try? \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Believers sue believers. In India, I was \nastounded to\u0014\n                           find few churches or ministries that \nweren't in the\u0014\n                           courts over property purchased using \nAmerican\u0014\n                           dollars. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           An independent, higher class of Christian \nworkers\u0014\n                           arises whose stylish lifestyles are envied \nby\u0014\n                           \"unconnected\" believers. It is little \nsurprise that\u0014\n                           motivation for \"spiritual growth\" soon is \ndriven by\u0014\n                           something less than a hunger after \nrighteousness.\u0014\n                           Should the donor seek to hold the recipient\u0014\n                           accountable for the use of funds to \nprevent such\u0014\n                           problems, the donor will be accused of \nreverting to old\u0014\n                           paternalistic patterns. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Recipients become ungrateful. \"Sure, you \ngave us\u0014\n                           something, but look how much money you \nstill have!\"\u0014\n                           Or, \"It's not yours anywayyou owe it to \nus.\" When I\u0014\n                           was president at Columbia International \nUniversity, I\u0014\n                           knew something was bothering some of the \nAfrican\u0014\n                           pastors studying with us. We discovered it \nwas\u0014\n                           money. Though none of them could have been \nthere\u0014\n                           without the great generosity of sponsoring \nmission\u0014\n                           agencies and the school, several recounted \nhow they\u0014\n                           were owed so much more. One pastor stated:\u0014\n                           \"Actually, you should not only fully \nsupport us now,\u0014\n                           you should support us for the first 5 or \n10 years after\u0014\n                           our return since you have dis-fitted us \nfor ministry in\u0014\n                           our homelands.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps the missiologist most knowledgeable \nabout the\u0014\n                      problems with the just-support-nationals \nmovement is Glenn\u0014\n                      Schwartz, founding director of World Mission \nAssociates. In\u0014\n                      an interview in Missions Frontiers Bulletin, he \nnoted another\u0014\n                      overlooked problem: \"I don't think anyone would \nsupport that\u0014\n                      approach if they had gone out as a missionary \nto plant\u0014\n                      churches cross-culturally according to healthy \nprinciples of\u0014\n                      self-support and then had someone come along \nand entice\u0014\n                      away their best leaders with foreign money. \nThat is what I call\u0014\n                      'shepherd stealing.' The 'just support \nnationals' people are\u0014\n                      doing it shamelessly and on a very large \nscale.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A number of non-Western church leaders quoted \nin the same\u0014\n                      issue of the journal agreed with Schwartz. \nBishop Zablon\u0014\n                      Nthamburi of the Methodist Church of Kenya, \nsaid: \"The\u0014\n                      African Church will not grow into maturity if \nit continues to be\u0014\n                      fed by western partners. It will ever remain an \ninfant who has\u0014\n                      not learned to walk on his or her own feet.\" \nOne leader in the\u0014\n                      Friends Missionary Prayer Band in India added: \n\"It's sad to\u0014\n                      say that foreign money has caused more harm \nthan good in\u0014\n                      Indian missions. The result is culturally \nirrelevant,\u0014\n                      pseudo-Christian leaders and organizations that \nhave long\u0014\n                      forgotten their roots.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Checking our mission bearings\u0014\n                     \u0014\n                      For years I have resisted addressing this issue \nbecause I\u0014\n                      haven't had a clear-cut solution to offer. But \nin searching for\u0014\n                      the key to unlock this greatest puzzle in the \ncurrent missions\u0014\n                      enterprise, I have become convinced the \napproach needs to\u0014\n                      be measured against the following four \nbiblically based\u0014\n                      principles concerning giving and receiving: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1. Does the giving win the lost? Paul was \nwilling to become\u0014\n                      anything to anyone for his single-minded \nobjective: to win as\u0014\n                      many lost as possible and as widely as \npossible. So today,\u0014\n                      one test of any missions approach should be its \nevangelistic\u0014\n                      effectiveness. Does money invested promote or \nretard\u0014\n                      long-term indigenous church growth and \nevangelism? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The incredible story of the church in South \nKorea is\u0014\n                      instructive. From the outset, it was the \nshowcase for the\u0014\n                      Nevius method of establishing self-governing, \nself-supporting,\u0014\n                      and self-propagating churches. That may have \nmeant slow\u0014\n                      growth at first, but today a third of South \nKoreans name\u0014\n                      Christ as Lord, and the church has sent out a \nmissionary\u0014\n                      task force of thousands. There are other \nfactors in the growth\u0014\n                      of the Korean church, of course, but the \nfoundation of\u0014\n                      independent dependence on God is cited by many \nas the\u0014\n                      chief factor. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. Does the giving encourage true discipleship? \nWhile\u0014\n                      evangelization is the controlling objective of \nthe missionary\u0014\n                      enterprise, it is useless if it doesn't produce \nChristlike\u0014\n                      character in both the giver and the receiver. \nSo we must ask if\u0014\n                      a giving arrangement nurtures generosity, \nhumility, unity, and\u0014\n                      compassion on the part of the giver. Is a \nchurch being truly\u0014\n                      generous if it is willing to send money but not \nits own sons\u0014\n                      and daughters to the mission field? Like Jesus \ncoming to\u0014\n                      Earth, does the giver feel a solidarity with, \nand a responsibility\u0014\n                      for, fellow believers in need? Are gifts given \nfrom the stance of\u0014\n                      a benefactor, or of a servant? \"I am among you \nas one who\u0014\n                      serves,\" said Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The fact is that the number of career \nmissionaries sent from\u0014\n                      North American churches has declined more than \n20 percent\u0014\n                      in this decade (to 40,000 from the 50,000 \nnumber that held for\u0014\n                      decades). And at least a billion of the lost \nlive among people\u0014\n                      where there is no evangelizing church movement, \noften no\u0014\n                      witness at all. By definition, someone must \nleave home to\u0014\n                      reach them. If a foreigner does not go in from \nthe outside,\u0014\n                      they will never hear the gospel. The \"don't \nsend people\" part\u0014\n                      of the equation is misguided, because there are \nno nationals\u0014\n                      to reach these billion people even if money \nwere sent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But even more important, from a biblical point \nof view, it is not\u0014\n                      just that North American missionaries are still \nneeded to\u0014\n                      complete the Great Commission. The North \nAmerican church\u0014\n                      needs to send its own for the sake of its own \nspiritual health.\u0014\n                      The sin of disobedience to the heavenly vision \ncannot be\u0014\n                      atoned for with dollars, and the spiritual loss \nis highly visible\u0014\n                      in a self-centered, materialistically minded \npeople. The\u0014\n                      original mandate to \"go into all the world\" has \nnever been\u0014\n                      rescinded. Paul's pioneering role remains the \nprimary mission\u0014\n                      of the church toward the world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The same question of discipleship must be asked \nof the\u0014\n                      receiving church. Do giving arrangements \nproduce a spirit of\u0014\n                      sacrificial giving, of responsible ownership of \nthe ministry, a\u0014\n                      greater reliance on God, and an attitude of \ngenuine gratitude\u0014\n                      among the recipients? If not, the money is \nactually more a\u0014\n                      taking than a giving. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I know an American missionary who, burdened by \nthe\u0014\n                      corrupting power of the American dollar on \ngiver and receiver,\u0014\n                      has chosen to live and minister among the poor \nof Calcutta,\u0014\n                      along with an Indian colleague, on $50 a month. \nThat isn't the\u0014\n                      only legitimate approach, of course, but it is \nan approach that\u0014\n                      models our God's incarnational, personal giving \nin Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      3. Does the giving honor the role of the local \nchurch? New\u0014\n                      Testament giving was church-centered. In 2 \nCorinthians 8 and\u0014\n                      9, we see that believers gave to their \nchurches, from which\u0014\n                      Paul received an offering to deliver to other \nneedy churches.\u0014\n                      These churches then distributed the funds to \nthe poor. The\u0014\n                      authority Christ invested in the church is lost \nwhen giving or\u0014\n                      receiving bypasses the church. The contemporary\u0014\n                      money-gathering agencies need to exercise great \ncare not to\u0014\n                      bypass the supervisory authority of the church \nat both ends. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      4. Does the giving nurture generous givers? \nGod's people are\u0014\n                      to givecompassionately, generously, \nsacrificially, joyfully\u0014\n                      (see 2 Cor. 8 and 9). Because this spirit of \ngenerosity serves\u0014\n                      as a fundamental test of the quality of \nspiritual life, Paul's\u0014\n                      admonition to \"excel in this grace of giving\" \nis not for the\u0014\n                      wealthy alone. There is a special obligation of \nthe wealthy to\u0014\n                      give (1 Tim. 6:17-19), but Paul commends the \npoor of Philippi\u0014\n                      for having given generously for the needs of \nthe poor in\u0014\n                      Jerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though this generosity principle should govern \ngiving, I list it\u0014\n                      last because the first three principles are \nmuch more\u0014\n                      dominant in the commands and examples of \nScripture. Many\u0014\n                      \"send money, not missionaries\" advocates are, I \nbelieve, in\u0014\n                      danger of operating from this principle alone \nto the exclusion\u0014\n                      of the other three principles. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To whom should we give money?\u0014\n                      The primary commands and examples for giving \nmoney in the\u0014\n                      New Testament center in one group: the poor. \nThe astounding\u0014\n                      offerings of propertied people in the church of \nJerusalem were\u0014\n                      to aid the poor (Acts 4:34-35), and the \nofferings Paul gathered\u0014\n                      from the \"missionary churches\" were also for \nthe poor in\u0014\n                      Jerusalem, the home church. There is a \nreference to giving to\u0014\n                      support Paul's missionary team on the part of \nthe \"younger\u0014\n                      church\" at Philippi (Phil. 4:10-19), and there \nis the incident\u0014\n                      where Paul may be asking for financial \nassistance for another\u0014\n                      missionary (1 Cor. 16:11). But I can find no \ninstance, let\u0014\n                      alone any command, to give toward the ministry \nof another\u0014\n                      church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One reason for this is evident. There were no \nchurch buildings\u0014\n                      or institutions like hospitals or schools, and \nlocal ministers\u0014\n                      were bivocational. If the early church is any \nmodel, it seems\u0014\n                      that paid ministry, buildings, and institutions \nemerged only as\u0014\n                      the church was able to afford them. From the \nbeginning, small\u0014\n                      groups of believers were self-supporting, \nself-governing, and\u0014\n                      self-propagating. Apparently for Paul, the \nspiritual strength\u0014\n                      derived from this independent reliance on God \nwas more\u0014\n                      important than was any kind of external subsidy \nto move\u0014\n                      things along more rapidly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Scripture is clear, then, that those who have \nmaterial\u0014\n                      resources are to share with those who lack \nthem. In the New\u0014\n                      Testament, this was providing the physical \nneeds of the\u0014\n                      impoverishedwhat today might be called\u0014\n                      relief-and-development projects. But when we \ntake the\u0014\n                      principle to mean assisting others in their \nspiritual ministry,\u0014\n                      we have no biblical command or precedent. If we \njustify the\u0014\n                      practice on the fourth principle of the need to \nexercise\u0014\n                      generosity, we have yet to find a practical way \nto do so that\u0014\n                      avoids spiritual harm to giver and receiver. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So, do we send money or people? Certainly we \nsend people,\u0014\n                      especially to cross into unreached frontiers \ntill the task of\u0014\n                      proclaiming the gospel to every man, woman, and \nchild is\u0014\n                      completed. And we send money to assist the poor \nand\u0014\n                      disenfranchised in our worldwide family. Beyond \nthose two\u0014\n                      New Testament patterns, I find not only no \njustification for\u0014\n                      supporting the ministry of other churches but \nalso great\u0014\n                      hazards in doing so. Sharing financial \nresources in a way that\u0014\n                      is spiritually empowering and Great Commission \n-completing\u0014\n                      for both donor and recipient remains our \ngreatest unsolved\u0014\n                      problem. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Robertson McQuilkin served as president of \nColumbia\u0014\n                      International University in South Carolina for \n22 years, was\u0014\n                      director of the Evangelical Missiological \nSociety, and is\u0014\n                      author of The Great Omission (Baker). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1999 by the author or Christianity \nToday\u0014\n                      International/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014",

    "words": "History bookshelves the world over are crammed \nfull of books about Hitler, Mussolini,\u0014\n                   and Franklin Roosevelt. Yet those three pivotal \nfigures of World War II found\u0014\n                   themselves pushed off America's front pagesfor \none year anywayby a figure who\u0014\n                   ruled no country, waged no war, and remained \nblithely oblivious to the ongoing\u0014\n                   global economic catastrophe. Seabiscuit, the \nscrappy horse who emerged from\u0014\n                   nowhere to become one of the greatest \nthoroughbreds in history, dominated the\u0014\n                   nation's headlines in 1938 and remains one of the \nbiggest newsmakers of the\u0014\n                   Depression era. Denied his place in the history \nbooks for too long, this ultimate\u0014\n                   equine underdog finally has his chronicler in \nLaura Hillenbrand.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Four lives intertwined\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Greatly expanded from Hillenbrand's award-winning \nAmerican Heritage magazine\u0014\n                   article, Seabiscuit brims with new information and \nfreshly retold anecdotes that add\u0014\n                   considerable depth to the Seabiscuit legend. This \nis the story of a racehorse, yes, but\u0014\n                   also the story of the three men with whose destiny \nhe became entwined. Charles\u0014\n                   Howard was a one-time bicycle repairman who made a \nfortune selling automobiles;\u0014\n                   he was one of the first to see in Seabiscuit the \nspirit of a champion. Tom Smith was\u0014\n                   the archetypal horse whispererpart trainer, part \nshaman; his knowledge of equine\u0014\n                   psychology was crucial to Seabiscuit's \ndevelopment. And finally there was Red\u0014\n                   Pollard, the Shakespearequoting journeyman \njockey; like the crooked-legged\u0014\n                   Seabiscuit, he too had a physical infirmityhe was \nblind in one eyebut he refused\u0014\n                   to let it stand in his way. With the dexterity of \na novelist, Hillenbrand weaves the\u0014\n                   stories of the three men together. One summer day \nin 1936, their paths converged\u0014\n                   with that of Seabiscuit, the young horse who, \nwhile descended from the great Man o'\u0014\n                   War, found himself prematurely washed up, \ndismissed as indolent, homely, even\u0014\n                   neurotic. From there, Seabiscuit becomes the tale \nof the building of a legend. Over\u0014\n                   a five year period, the suddenly unstoppable horse \nwon 33 of the 89 races he\u0014\n                   entered, set numerous track records carrying \nrecord weights, and captured the\u0014\n                   imagination of the public. Nineteen thirty-eight \nproved to be Seabiscuit's most\u0014\n                   glorious year. Pitted in a match race against the \ngreat War Admiral, the 1937 Triple\u0014\n                   Crown winner and his half-brother, Seabiscuit rose \nto the challenge before a crowd\u0014\n                   estimated at more than 40,000. He wore out War \nAdmiral down the stretch to win by\u0014\n                   four lengths. President Roosevelt himself put off \na cabinet meeting to listen to the\u0014\n                   race on the radio.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   His place in history \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Seabiscuit received Horse of the Year honors for \nthat performance, still remembered\u0014\n                   as perhaps the greatest match race in history. \nInjuries took their toll the following\u0014\n                   year, threatening to bring the horse's brilliant \nrun to an end, but Seabiscuit came\u0014\n                   back in 1940 to capture the Santa Anita \nHandicapthe one prize that had eluded\u0014\n                   him during his run of greatness and the victory \nhis owner most coveted. Hillenbrand\u0014\n                   relates the many twists and turns in the horse's \ncareer in a way that will engross even\u0014\n                   nonfans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   By turns poetic and picaresque, Seabiscuit is an \nexciting sports story that crosses the\u0014\n                   line into social history. Like the baseball books \nof David Halberstam, it uses sports \u0014\n                   as a point of departure for an examination of \nlarger cultural phenomena.

    "words": "Mohler: SBC controversy reflects core beliefs\u0014\n about truth, liberty\u0014\n Mar 22, 2001\u0014\n By Jeff Robinson \u0014\n\u0014\n LOUISVILLE, Ky. (BP)--The overarching issue that divides Southern\u0014\n Baptist moderates and conservatives is divergent understandings of\u0014\n Baptist identity, R. Albert Mohler Jr. told a group of conferees at\u0014\n Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mohler, president of the Louisville, Ky., seminary, spoke on the\u0014\n issue of Southern Baptist identity in the opening address of\u0014\n \"Southern Baptists in the New Millennium: Identity, Orthodoxy, and\u0014\n Cooperation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The SBC controversy is rooted in an argument over Baptist history\u0014\n and what role that history should play in the modern church, Mohler\u0014\n said in addressing the Feb. 26-28 conference on the SBC's identity\u0014\n and history.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Here moderates and conservatives have different understandings of\u0014\n its binding authority on Baptists present, or certainly which aspects\u0014\n of Baptist history are to be given deferential treatment over others\u0014\n and greater authority.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The Southern Baptist controversy, at the most fundamental level,\u0014\n has been over core beliefs and the basic vision for -- or worldview \nof\u0014\n -- the convention, Mohler said, with many conservatives and\u0014\n moderates having stood on opposite sides of moral issues such as\u0014\n abortion as well as theological issues such as inerrancy and other\u0014\n core doctrinal beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\n The differing parties could be divided into two camps: the truth \nparty\u0014\n and the liberty party, Mohler said. The truth party emphasizes the\u0014\n authority of Scripture and its inerrancy, while the liberty party\u0014\n focuses on personal autonomy. These are the theological\u0014\n underpinnings of the two sides' differing views of Baptist identity, \nhe\u0014\n said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The truth party, to speak mostly of conservatives, spoke very\u0014\n clearly that what was threatened was truth,\" he said. \"And that\u0014\n truth [is] the faith once and for all delivered to the saints, and \nthose\u0014\n truths are non-negotiable and essential.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The liberty party argued that what was most threatened was\u0014\n Baptist liberty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The controversy as it stands today had its beginnings in 1920 in the\u0014\n modernist-fundamentalist controversy and the framing of the 1925\u0014\n Baptist Faith and Message statement of SBC beliefs. It escalated\u0014\n in the 1963 revision of the BFM and the failure of a satisfactory\u0014\n resolution of the Broadman Bible Commentary, then with the\u0014\n election of Adrian Rogers as president of the SBC in 1979.\u0014\n\u0014\n The differences between the two groups have grown even greater in\u0014\n the past two decades after conservatives regained leadership in the\u0014\n convention, Mohler said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The truth and the liberty party are divided by this basic vision, a\u0014\n vision of what the denomination is, what its history represents, what\u0014\n its opportunities are, how its polity is to be organized, what its\u0014\n ethos is to be, what kind of symbols it is to champion and prize.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The distance between the two parties is more dramatic now, but\u0014\n the seeds of the present reality were sown in the 1920s, I will\u0014\n argue, in the controversy over supernaturalism. They were scattered\u0014\n during the war years, watered during the 1960s and '70s, and they\u0014\n matured during the last two decades of the 20th century.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The Southern Baptist controversy is much deeper than some would\u0014\n believe, Mohler said, noting that by the 1990s crises of theology,\u0014\n authority, confessionalism, polity and culture existed along with\u0014\n identity in the SBC.\u0014\n\u0014\n These factors remain in dividing conservatives and moderates and\u0014\n have been profoundly manifested in recent revisions of the Baptist\u0014\n Faith and Message. Revisions in 1998 -- the adoption of the family\u0014\n amendment -- and last year displayed publicly the confessional\u0014\n differences between the two sides, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n The most troubling threat to emerge from these recent debates is\u0014\n that of theological minimalism, a threat that is being perpetrated by\u0014\n both sides, Mohler said.\u0014\n\u0014\n It is dangerous for members of either camp to \"say, 'Let's get it\u0014\n down to this.' That reductionism I would argue is the continuing\u0014\n source of theological crisis and identity,\" Mohler said. \"Among the\u0014\n moderates, this theological minimalism is most often by intention.\u0014\n Among conservatives, it's largely by the temptation of pragmatism\u0014\n and the sublimation of virtually all theological issues to \noperational\u0014\n concerns.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Bound up in the SBC identity crisis, Mohler said, is a tribal element\u0014\n unique to Southern Baptists. Many are Baptists simply because\u0014\n they have always been Baptists. He said it is a common thread on\u0014\n both sides of the debate.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mohler said the debate boils down to which element Southern\u0014\n Baptists view as of primary relevance in defining the denominational\u0014\n vision.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The tribal dimension is not to be denied,\" he said. \"The issue of\u0014\n debate [is] ... whether there is an essential and non-negotiable\u0014\n aspect to identity. And the question comes down to whether the\u0014\n tribal issues are accountable to the theology or the theology to the\u0014\n tribal ethos.\"\u0014",

Hymns are \none of the\u0014\n                      only remaining doors through which names, \nsounds, and\u0014\n                      words from the church's past enter \ncongregational life, and I\u0014\n                      can't help feeling that each time the worship \npastor passes\u0014\n                      over an old song in favor of a more recent \ncreation, that door\u0014\n                      creaks toward shutting. Part of my frustration \nis personal (I've\u0014\n                      never been a big chorus fan), but mostly I miss \nthe rich\u0014\n                      tradition we're steadily losing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Five hundred years ago this week, on January \n13, 1501, the\u0014\n                      first vernacular hymnal was printed in Prague. \nIt featured 89\u0014\n                      Moravian hymns in Czech, some penned by martyred\u0014\n                      reformer Jan Hus. Though several of the hymns \nwere based\u0014\n                      on Gregorian chants, for the most part the \ncollection broke\u0014\n                      with Catholic tradition. Catholic worship at \nthe time included\u0014\n                      only music written in Latin and sung by \nprofessionals;\u0014\n                      Moravians helped re-introduce the custom of \ncongregational\u0014\n                      singing in a language all could understand.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Moravian, or Hussite, hymns often focused on \nthemes central\u0014\n                      to the reform movement. Battle hymns like \"Oh, \nYe Warriors\u0014\n                      of the Lord\" united communities, lifted \nsoldiers' spirits, and\u0014\n                      proclaimed reforming beliefs. Other songs \nhighlighted the\u0014\n                      Moravians' strong feelings about \nCommunionmainly that lay\u0014\n                      people ought to be able to receive the cup as \nwell as the\u0014\n                      bread. One of Hus's hymns on the subject, \n\"Jesus Christ, Our\u0014\n                      Blessed Savior,\" still appears in some Lutheran \nhymnals. It\u0014\n                      includes these stanzas:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Jesus Christ, our blessed Savior,\u0014\n                           Turned away God's wrath forever;\u0014\n                           By His bitter grief and woe\u0014\n                           He saved us from the evil Foe.\u0014\n                           As His pledge of love undying\u0014\n                           He, this precious food supplying,\u0014\n                           Gives His body with the bread\u0014\n                           And with the wine the blood He shed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Martin Luther, in many ways an heir of Hus (see \n\"The\u0014\n                      Reformation Connection\"), also wrote and \npublished hymns in\u0014\n                      the vernacularin his case, German. With Johann \nWalther,\u0014\n                      Luther produced an important hymnal in 1524 \nthat included\u0014\n                      early chorales (unharmonized and unaccompanied \nmelodies)\u0014\n                      as well as derivations of plainsong, devotional \nsongs, and\u0014\n                      secular songs. In general, German Protestants \nwere eager to\u0014\n                      adapt the finest elements of musical \nartincluding, after\u0014\n                      Luther, the organ and highly complex \narrangementsfor\u0014\n                      church use. It's no coincidence that J.S. Bach \nand George\u0014\n                      Frideric Handel were both Lutherans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In contrast, Calvinists in France, Scotland, \nand England\u0014\n                      tended to believe that anything not found in \nthe Bible should\u0014\n                      not be found in Christian worship, either. Thus \nCalvinists sang\u0014\n                      only from the psalter, in unison and \nunaccompanied. The\u0014\n                      English psalter used only a restricted number \nof tunes and\u0014\n                      meters. Even so, songbooks like the 1562 \ncollection by\u0014\n                      Sternhold and Hopkins and the 1640 Bay Psalm \nBook,\u0014\n                      published in Massachusetts, were widely used.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The psalter monopoly began to break up in the \neighteenth\u0014\n                      century as British musicians became frustrated \nwith the\u0014\n                      constraints imposed by the Church of England. \nAs Isaac\u0014\n                      Watts complained, \"To see the dull \nindifference, the negligent\u0014\n                      and thoughtless air, that sits upon the faces \nof the whole\u0014\n                      assembly while the psalm is on their lips, \nmight tempt even a\u0014\n                      charitable observer to suspect the fervor of \ninward religion.\"\u0014\n                      Watts, a Congregationalist, released his \nalternative, Hymns\u0014\n                      and Spiritual Songs, in 1707the same year that \nBach's first\u0014\n                      work became public and that Charles Wesley was \nborn.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1735, Charles and his brother John Wesley \nencountered\u0014\n                      Moravian hymns firsthand while sailing to \nAmerica on a\u0014\n                      missionary venture. German-speaking Moravian \nsettlers\u0014\n                      onboard their ship sang hymns during a violent \nstorm, which\u0014\n                      amazed the Wesleys. Just a few years later, \nJohn began\u0014\n                      translating German hymns into English, while \nCharles was\u0014\n                      writing his own Moravian-inspired hymns. These \ncompositions\u0014\n                      and others appeared among the 525 pieces in the \nhighly\u0014\n                      influential Collection of Hymns for the Use of \nthe People\u0014\n                      Called Methodists in 1780. Even with this new \noption, though,\u0014\n                      the Church of England did not authorize hymn \nsinging until\u0014\n                      1820.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today new, or at least revised, hymnals are \nissued all the\u0014\n                      time. Each reflects the biases of an editor \nand, often, of a\u0014\n                      denomination, and some give tradition more \nweight than\u0014\n                      others. Rejoice in the Lord, a Reformed Church \nin America\u0014\n                      hymnal from the mid-1980s, falls on the \nconservative side\u0014\n                      (including many selections from old psalters) \nbut represents\u0014\n                      the tensions of current collections.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The editor, the late Erik Routley, explained in \nthe introduction\u0014\n                      that some familiar pieces were omitted for \nvarious reasons: to\u0014\n                      make room for modern needs, because they were \nseldom\u0014\n                      sung, because they were nation-specific \n(patriotic), or\u0014\n                      because they were deemed \"inappropriate\" or \n\"theologically\u0014\n                      dubious.\" Yet Routley felt that the volume \nsolidly upheld\u0014\n                      tradition, as he wrote, \"But in replacing the \n'old with the new'\u0014\n                      we are not in fact merely replacing the ancient \nwith the\u0014\n                      modern. Not infrequently we are recovering the \nancient and\u0014\n                      inviting the less distinguished modern to make \nway for it. Our\u0014\n                      own prayerful guess has been that today, after \na generation of\u0014\n                      rejection of the old, we are ready for exactly \nsuch a\u0014\n                      rediscovery.\" I, for one, hope he's right.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Elesha Coffman is associate editor of Christian \nHistory.\u0014",

    "words": "STUDIES IN THE PSALMS\u0014\n\u0014\nI. INTRODUCTION\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Psalms are the most ancient, complete, and expressive collection \nof human praise ever known. The collection of 150 poems is, indeed, a \nmanual of devotion. It has been called, \"a casket of praise, full of \ngems of adoration.\" For many reasons Psalms should hold a maJor place \nin our worship. One is that they are God-centered instead of \nperson-centered as so many devotional materials are. Second, they \nascribe all glory to the only true and living God, and third, they \nlead the worshipper to praise God for what he is in himelf and thank \nhim for what he is to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Milton said, \"There are no songs like the songs of Zion.\" THE \nEARLY CHURCH REQUIRED ALL MINISTERS TO KNOW THE PSALMS FROM MEMORY.\u0014\n\u0014\nII. CHARACTERISTICS OF HEBREW POETRY:\u0014\n\u0014\nA. It has no rhyme. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs compared with the Koran in Arabic. (I like my poetry to rhyme, to \nthe horrow of english maJors!)\u0014\n\u0014\nB. The authors used an acrostic structure\u0014\nto aid the memory. \u0014\n\u0014\nVery common technique.eg. EMTs use A-M-P-L-E to aid them in doing \ntheir primary survey of an inJured person:\u0014\nA-allergies?\u0014\nK-on medications?\u0014\nP-any previous illnesses?\u0014\nL-when was last time you ate? \u0014\nE-what events preceded accident?\u0014\n\u0014\n1. In Psalm 111 and 112 each clause begins with a new letter of the \nHebrew alphabet in regular order {Cp. headings of Psalm 119)\u0014\n2. In Psa. 25,34, and 145 each verse begins with a new letter; in \nPsalm 37 each alternate verse begins with a new letter.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 119, every eight verses -new letter.\u0014\n3. This very common in Chinese literature, the simplest form being \nthat in which a hidden sentence is revealed by taking the first word \nin each line of a short poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nC. Parallelism is the chief characteristic of Hebrew poetry.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive different kinds have been identified:\u0014\n1. Synonymous -in which the same thought is repeated in different \nwords, e.g. Psalm 103:10,\u0014\n\"He has not deal t with us according to our sins,\u0014\nNor rewarded us after our iniquities.\"\u0014\n2. Antithetical -a thought is illustrated by its opposite, e.g. Psa. \n1:6,\u0014\n\"For the Lord knows the way of the\u0014\nrighteous;\u0014\n     But the way of the wicked shall perish.\" \u0014\n3. Synthetic -corresponding in\u0014\nform but differing in thought, e.g. Psa.\u0014\n115:5,\u0014\n\"They have mouths, but they speak not;\u0014\nEyes they have, but they see not.\"\u0014\n4. Climacteric (or Progressive) - stairlike, being especially \ncharacteristic of the Songs of Ascent. (Psa.121,1-2)\u0014\n5. Introverted -the first line is closely related in thought to the \nfourth, and the second to the third, e.g. Psa. 91:14).\u0014\nD. Interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Equally as important as parallelism is figurative expression. As \nin the poetry of all nations. that of the Hebrews abounds in figures. \nThere are two important considerations in dealing with these \nfigurative expressions:\u0014\n(l)The figure must be accepted and dealt with as a figure and not as \na literal statement.\u0014\n(2)The figure must be interpreted in the light of the meaning of that \nfigure in the day and setting in which it was used.\u0014\n2. The Psalms do not present a system of biblical theology, but they \nreflect the theology and religious experiences of the writers. They \ntouch all the feelings arid stresses of life, both personal and \nnational\u0014\n             \u0014\nE. Authorship\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the entire collection is known as \"the Psalms of David\", \nonly 100 have titles of authorship. 73 are Ascribed to David, 2 to \nSolomon,l to Moses, to Asaph 12, to Korah 11, to Ethan 1, to Heman 1. \nThese mayor may not reflect actual authorship.\u0014\nSome might reflect \"dedicated to\" as in most of our books today.\u0014\n\u0014\nF. Form or structure.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalms is divided into five books. There are two noteworthy \ncollections within the book. One is the \"Egyptian Hallel\" (Psalm \n113-118), which was sung at Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. \nCertainly Jesus used this. The other is the psalms known as \"the \nSongs of Ascent\" (Psas.120-134) or Pilgrim songs. They were sung \ngoing up to Jerusalem or on the steps leading up from the court of \nthe temple.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the editing of the Psalms several have been repeated either wholly \nor in part, e.g. Psa. 14 differs from Psalm 53 only in the use of the \nDivine names; Psa. 15 is very similar in thought and phraseology to \nPsa. 24:1-6; Psa. 18 is parallel to 2 Sam. 22 (John Wesley's \nfavorite); Psa. 60:5-12 is practically verbatim with Psa. 108:6-13; \nPsa. 70 is almost the same as Psa. 40:13-17; and Psa. 108:1-5 \npractically duplicates Psa. 57:7-11.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       SURVEYING THE PSALMS\u0014\n\u0014\nHerman Gunkel divided the Psalms into five maJor and several minor \ntypes:\u0014\n1. Hymns for the Praise of God (8,19,103,etc)\u0014\n(1) Songs 0 Zion (Pss. 46,48,76,87) (2) Enthronement Songs \n(Pss.24,47,93,96,97,98,99)\u0014\n2. Laments of the Community, appropriate for fast days (Pss. \n44,58,60,74,79,80,83,,85,90,94,106,108,1 5,137).\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Royal Psalms (2,18,20,21,45,72,101,110,132,144).\u0014\n4. Individual Laments\u0014\n(3,5,6,7,13,17,22,25,26,27,28,31,32,35,3 \n,39,42,-43,51,54,56,57,59,61,63,64,69,70 \n71,86,88,102,109,120,130,140,142,142,143\u0014\n(1) Penitential Psalms (6,32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143).\u0014\n(2) Prophetic Liturgies (12,14,50,53,75,81,82,95)\u0014\n(3) Psalms of Confidence (4,11,16,12,27,62,131).\u0014\n(4) Imprecatory Psalms (69,137)\u0014\n5. Individual Songs of Thanksgiving \n(18~30~32~34~41~66~92~116~118~138).\u0014\n\u0014\nGunkel's Sub-groups\u0014\n1. Songs of Pilgrimage (84,122,134) \u0014\n2. Communal Songs of Thanksgiving <65,67,118,124).\u0014\n3. Wisdom Poetry (1,37,49,73,112,127,128,133)\u0014\n4. Psalms Dealing with the Law(1~15~19~24~119).\u0014\n5.

    "words": "Still Surprised by Lewis \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Why this nonevangelical Oxford don has\u0014\n                      become our patron saint. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      J. I. Packer\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Born 100 years ago come November, C. S. Lewis is\u0014\n                      today beloved of evangelicals. His books have \nbrought\u0014\n                      provided beeline expression to our rabbit-trail \nthoughts,\u0014\n                      compelling language to our religious longings, \nand a vision of\u0014\n                      God to our impaired imaginations. In this \nessay, J. I. Packer\u0014\n                      explains why a man whose theology had decidedly\u0014\n                      unevangelical elements has come to be the \nAquinas, the\u0014\n                      Augustine, and the Aesop of contemporary \nevangelicalism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yes, I was at Oxford in Lewis's day (I went up \nin 1944); but\u0014\n                      no, I never met him. He was regularly on show \nas the\u0014\n                      anchorman of the Socratic Club, which met \nweekly to discuss\u0014\n                      how science, philosophy, and current culture \nrelated to\u0014\n                      Christianity; but as a young believer, I was \nsure I needed\u0014\n                      Bible teaching rather than apologetics, so I \npassed the\u0014\n                      Socratic by. The nearest I ever got to Lewis \nwas hearing him\u0014\n                      address the Oxford theologians' society on \nRichard Hooker,\u0014\n                      about whom he was writing at that time for his \nassigned\u0014\n                      volume of the Oxford History of English \nLiterature, the\u0014\n                      \"Oh-Hell\" as for obvious reasons he liked to \ncall it. He spoke\u0014\n                      with a resonant Anglicized accent (you would \nnever have\u0014\n                      guessed he was Irish), and when he said \nsomething funny,\u0014\n                      which he did quite often, he paused like a \nstage comedian for\u0014\n                      the laugh. They said he was the best lecturer \nin Oxford, and I\u0014\n                      daresay they were right. But he was not really \npart of my\u0014\n                      world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet I owe him much, and I gratefully \nacknowledge my debt. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      First of all, in 1942-43, when I thought I was \na Christian but\u0014\n                      did not yet know what a Christian wasand had \nspent a year\u0014\n                      verifying the old adage that if you open your \nmind wide\u0014\n                      enough much rubbish will be tipped into itThe \nScrewtape\u0014\n                      Letters and the three small books that became \nMere\u0014\n                      Christianity brought me, not indeed to faith in \nthe full sense,\u0014\n                      but to mainstream Christian beliefs about God, \nman, and\u0014\n                      Jesus Christ, so that now I was halfway there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, in 1945, when I was newly converted, \nthe student\u0014\n                      who was discipling me lent me The Pilgrim's \nRegress. This\u0014\n                      gave me both a full-color map of the Western \nintellectual\u0014\n                      world as it had been in 1932 and still pretty \nmuch was 13\u0014\n                      years later, and also a very deep delight in \nknowing that I\u0014\n                      knew God, beyond anything I had felt before. \nThe vivid glow of\u0014\n                      Lewis's scenic and dramatic imagination, as \ndeployed in the\u0014\n                      story, had started to grab me. Regress, Lewis's \nfirst literary\u0014\n                      effort as a Christian, is still for me the \nfreshest and liveliest of\u0014\n                      all his books, and I reread it more often than \nany of the\u0014\n                      others. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Third, Lewis sang the praises of an author \nnamed Charles\u0014\n                      Williams, of whom I had not heard, and in \nconsequence I\u0014\n                      picked up Many Dimensions in paperback in 1953 \nand had\u0014\n                      one of the most overwhelming reading \nexperiences of my\u0014\n                      lifethough that is another story. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fourth, there are stellar passages in Lewis \nthat for me, at\u0014\n                      least, bring the reality of heaven very close. \nFew Christian\u0014\n                      writers today try to write about heaven, and \nthe theme defeats\u0014\n                      almost all who take it up. But as one who \nlearned long ago\u0014\n                      from Richard Baxter's Saints' Everlasting Rest \nand Bunyan's\u0014\n                      Pilgrim's Progress the need for clearly focused \nthought about\u0014\n                      heaven, I am grateful for the way Lewis helps \nme along here. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The number of Christians whom Lewis's writings \nhave helped,\u0014\n                      one way and another, is enormous. Since his \ndeath in 1963,\u0014\n                      sales of his books have risen to 2 million a \nyear, and a\u0014\n                      recently polled cross section of ct readers \nrated him the most\u0014\n                      influential writer in their liveswhich is odd, \nfor they and I\u0014\n                      identify ourselves as evangelicals, and Lewis \ndid no such\u0014\n                      thing. He did not attend an evangelical place \nof worship nor\u0014\n                      fraternize with evangelical organizations. \"I \nam a very ordinary\u0014\n                      layman of the Church of England,\" he wrote; \n\"not especially\u0014\n                      'high,' nor especially 'low,' nor especially \nanything else.\" By\u0014\n                      ordinary evangelical standards, his idea about \nthe Atonement\u0014\n                      (archetypal penitence, rather than penal \nsubstitution), and his\u0014\n                      failure ever to mention justification by faith \nwhen speaking of\u0014\n                      the forgiveness of sins, and his apparent \nhospitality to\u0014\n                      baptismal regeneration, and his noninerrantist \nview of biblical\u0014\n                      inspiration, plus his quiet affirmation of \npurgatory and of the\u0014\n                      possible final salvation of some who have left \nthis world as\u0014\n                      nonbelievers, were weaknesses; they led the \nlate, great\u0014\n                      Martyn Lloyd-Jones, for whom evangelical \northodoxy was\u0014\n                      mandatory, to doubt whether Lewis was a \nChristian at all. His\u0014\n                      closest friends were Anglo-Catholics or Roman \nCatholics; his\u0014\n                      parish church, where he worshiped regularly, \nwas \"high\"; he\u0014\n                      went to confession; he was, in fact, anchored \nin the (small-c)\u0014\n                      \"catholic\" stream of Anglican thought, which \nsome (not all)\u0014\n                      regard as central. Yet evangelicals love his \nbooks and profit\u0014\n                      from them hugely. Why? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As one involved in this situation, I offer the \nfollowing answer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the first place, Lewis was a lay evangelist, \nconservative in\u0014\n                      his beliefs and powerful in his defense of the \nold paths. \"Ever\u0014\n                      since I became a Christian,\" he wrote in 1952, \n\"I have thought\u0014\n                      that the best, perhaps the only service I could \ndo for my\u0014\n                      unbelieving neighbors was to explain and defend \nthe belief\u0014\n                      that has been common to nearly all Christians \nat all times.\"\u0014\n                      To make ordinary people think about historic \nChristianity, and\u0014\n                      to see and feel the strength and attraction of \nthe case for it,\u0014\n                      was Lewis's goal throughout. All through his \nwritings runs the\u0014\n                      sense that moderns have ceased to think about \nlife and\u0014\n                      reality in a serious way and have settled \ninstead for mindless\u0014\n                      drift with the crowd, or blind trust in \ntechnology, or the\u0014\n                      Athenian frivolity of always chasing new ideas, \nor the nihilism\u0014\n                      of knee-jerk negativism toward everything in \nthe past. The\u0014\n                      Christian spokesman's first task, as Lewis saw \nit, is to put all\u0014\n                      this into reverse and get folk thinking again. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So his immediate goal in a sustained flow of \ndidactic books,\u0014\n                      opinion pieces, children's stories, adult \nfiction and fantasy,\u0014\n                      autobiography, and poems, along with works of \nliterary history\u0014\n                      and criticism, spread out over more than 30 \nyears, was to stir\u0014\n                      up serious thought. About what? About the \nChristian values\u0014\n                      and perspectives that the people he once \nlabeled the Clevers\u0014\n                      had left behind, and about the morasses one \ngets bogged\u0014\n                      down in once the Christian heritage is \nabandoned; and on\u0014\n                      from there. He would have agreed with the \noften-stated dictum\u0014\n                      of fellow evangelist Martyn Lloyd-Jones that \nthe Christian is\u0014\n                      and must be the greatest thinker in the \nuniverse, and that\u0014\n                      God's first step in adult conversion is to make \nthe person\u0014\n                      think. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis was clear that, as he has Screwtape tell \nus in many\u0014\n                      different ways, thoughtlessness ruins souls; so \nhe labored\u0014\n                      mightily by all kinds of stimulating \npersuasiveswitty,\u0014\n                      argumentative, pictorial, fanciful, logical, \nprophetic, and\u0014\n                      dramatic by turnsto ensure, so far as he \ncould, that\u0014\n                      death-dealing thoughtlessness would not \nflourish while he\u0014\n                      was around. His constant pummelling of his \nreader's mind\u0014\n                      was neither Ulster temperament nor Oxford \ndidacticism, but\u0014\n                      the urgent compassionate expression of one who \nknew that\u0014\n                      the only alternative to grasping God's truth \nand seeing\u0014\n                      everything by its light is idiocy in one form \nor another. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And he believed, surely with reason, that his \ncredibility as a\u0014\n                      Christian spokesman in an anticlerical age was \nenhanced by\u0014\n                      the fact that he had no professional religious \nidentity but was\u0014\n                      just an Anglican layman earning his salt by \nteaching English\u0014\n                      at Oxford. As G. K. Chesterton was to himself \nsimply a\u0014\n                      journalist with a significant Christian \noutlook, so Lewis was to\u0014\n                      himself simply an academic with a significant \nspare-time\u0014\n                      vocation of Christian utterance. Evangelicals \nappreciate lay\u0014\n                      evangelists of Lewis's kind. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, Lewis was a brilliant teacher. His \nstrength lay not in\u0014\n                      the forming of new ideas but in the arresting \nsimplicity, both\u0014\n                      logical and imaginative, with which he \nprojected old ones. Not\u0014\n                      wasting words, he plunged straight into things \nand boiled\u0014\n                      matters down to essentials, positioning himself \nas a\u0014\n                      common-sense, down-to-earth, no-nonsense \nobserver,\u0014\n                      analyst, and conversation partner. On paper he \nhad a flair,\u0014\n                      comparable to that of the great evangelists in \nthe pulpit\u0014\n                      (Whitefield, Spurgeon, Graham, for example), \nfor making you\u0014\n                      feel he is in personal conversation with you, \nsearching your\u0014\n                      heart and requiring of you total honesty in \nresponse. Never\u0014\n                      pontifical, never browbeating, and never \nwrapping things up,\u0014\n                      Lewis achieved an intimacy of instruction that \nis very unusual.\u0014\n                      Those who read today what he wrote half a \ncentury ago find\u0014\n                      him engaging and holding their attention, and \nwhen the\u0014\n                      reading is over, haunting them, in the sense \nthat they do not\u0014\n                      forget what he said. At his best, Lewis is a \nteacher of great\u0014\n                      piercing power. What is his secret? \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis's mind was so highly\u0014\n                      developed that all of his\u0014\n                      arguments are illustrations,\u0014\n                      while all of his\u0014\n                      illustrations are arguements.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The secret lies in the blend of logic and \nimagination in Lewis's\u0014\n                      make-up, each power as strong as the other, and \neach\u0014\n                      enormously strong in its own right. In one \nsense, imagination\u0014\n                      took the lead. As Lewis wrote in 1954: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           The imaginative man in me is older, more\u0014\n                           continuously operative, and in that sense \nmore\u0014\n                           basic than either the religious writer or \nthe\u0014\n                           critic. It was he who made me first \nattempt (with\u0014\n                           little success) to be a poet. It was he \nwho\u0014\n                           after my conversion led me to embody my\u0014\n                           religious belief in symbolic or mythopoeic\u0014\n                           forms, ranging from Screwtape to a kind of\u0014\n                           theologized science-fiction. And it was of\u0014\n                           course he who has brought me, in the last \nfew\u0014\n                           years, to write the series of Narnia \nstories for\u0014\n                           childrenbecause the fairy tale was the \ngenre\u0014\n                           best fitted for what I wanted to say. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The best teachers are always those in whom \nimagination and\u0014\n                      logical control combine, so that you receive \nwisdom from their\u0014\n                      flights of fancy as well as a human heartbeat \nfrom their logical\u0014\n                      analyses and arguments. This in fact is human\u0014\n                      communication at its profoundest, for in the \nsending-receiving\u0014\n                      process of both lobes of the brain (left for \nlogic, right for\u0014\n                      imagination) are fully involved, and that gives \ngreat depth and\u0014\n                      strength to what is heard. The teaching of \nJesus presents\u0014\n                      itself as the supreme example here. Because \nLewis's mind\u0014\n                      was so highly developed in both directions, it \ncan truly be\u0014\n                      said of him that all of his arguments \n(including his literary\u0014\n                      criticism) are illustrations, in the sense that \nthey throw light\u0014\n                      directly on realities of life and action, while \nall his illustrations\u0014\n                      (including the fiction and fantasies) are \narguments, in the\u0014\n                      sense that they throw light directly on \nrealities of truth and\u0014\n                      fact. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      G. K. Chesterton, Charles Williams, and to some \nextent\u0014\n                      Dorothy L. Sayers exhibit the same sort of \nbipolar mental\u0014\n                      development, and what I have said of Lewis's \nwritings can be\u0014\n                      said of theirs, too. Such minds will always \ncommand\u0014\n                      attention, and when possessed, as the minds of \nthese four\u0014\n                      were possessed, by the values and visions of \nChristian faith\u0014\n                      and Christian humanism, they will always make \nan appeal\u0014\n                      that is hard to resist; and that appeal will \nnot diminish as the\u0014\n                      culture changes. Visionary didacticism, as in \nPlato, Jesus,\u0014\n                      and Paul (to look no further) is transcultural, \nand unfading in\u0014\n                      its power. Bible-loving evangelicals, who build \ntheir whole faith\u0014\n                      on the logical-visionary teaching of God \nhimself via his\u0014\n                      servants from Genesis to Revelation, naturally \nseek and\u0014\n                      appreciate this mode of communication in their \nlatter-day\u0014\n                      instructors, and the consensus among them is \nthat no\u0014\n                      twentieth-century writer has managed it so \nbrilliantly as did C.\u0014\n                      S. Lewis. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Third, Lewis projects a vision of \nwholenesssanity, maturity,\u0014\n                      present peace and joy, and finally fulfillment \nin heaventhat\u0014\n                      cannot but attract, willy-nilly, the adult \nchildren of our\u0014\n                      confused, disillusioned, alienated, and \nembittered culture: the\u0014\n                      now established culture of the West, which we \nshall certainly\u0014\n                      take with us (or maybe, I should say, which \nwill certainly take\u0014\n                      us with it) into the new millennium. Both \nLewis's didactic\u0014\n                      expositions (think of The Problem of Pain, The \nScrewtape\u0014\n                      Letters, Mere Christianity, Miracles, The Four \nLoves, Letters\u0014\n                      to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer, and Reflections \non the\u0014\n                      Psalms) and his fiction (think of the three \nRansom stories,\u0014\n                      the seven Narnia tales, The Great Divorce, and \nTill We Have\u0014\n                      Faces) yield a vision of human life under God \n(or Maleldil, or\u0014\n                      Aslan, or the unnamed divinity who confronts \nOrual) that is\u0014\n                      redemptive, transformational, virtue-valuing, \nand shot through\u0014\n                      with hints and flashes of breathtaking glory \nand eternal delight\u0014\n                      in a world to come. To be sure, the vision is \nhumbling, for the\u0014\n                      shattering of all egoistic pride, all \nPromethean heroics, and all\u0014\n                      the possessive perversions of love is part of \nit. In the text of all\u0014\n                      his Christian writings, and in the subtext, at \nleast, of all his\u0014\n                      wider literary work, Lewis rings endless \nchanges on the same\u0014\n                      story: a story of moral and intellectual \ncorruption, embryonic\u0014\n                      or developed, being overcome in some way, \nwhereby more or\u0014\n                      less disordered human beings, victims of bad \nthinking and\u0014\n                      bad influences from outside, find peace, poise, \ndiscernment,\u0014\n                      realism, fulfillment, and a meaningful future. \nEvangelicals love\u0014\n                      such writing: who can wonder at that? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Here we are at the deepest level of Lewis's \ncreative identity.\u0014\n                      At bottom he was a mythmaker. As Austin Farrer, \nLewis's\u0014\n                      closest clerical friend and Oxford's most \nbrilliant theologian at\u0014\n                      that time, observed, in Lewis's apologetics \"we \nthink we are\u0014\n                      listening to an argument; in fact, we are \npresented with a\u0014\n                      vision; and it is the vision that carries \nconviction.\" Myth is\u0014\n                      perhaps best defined as a story that projects a \nvision of life of\u0014\n                      actual or potential communal significance by \nreason of the\u0014\n                      identity and attitudes that it invites us to \nadopt. Lewis had\u0014\n                      loved the pre-Christian god-stories of Norse \nand Greek\u0014\n                      mythology, and the thought that did most to \nshape his return\u0014\n                      to Christianity and his literary output \nthereafter was this: In\u0014\n                      the Incarnation, a myth that recurs worldwide, \nthe myth of a\u0014\n                      dying and rising deity through whose ordeal \nsalvation comes\u0014\n                      to others, has become a space-time fact. Both \nbefore Christ,\u0014\n                      in pagan mythology, and since Christ, in \nimaginative fiction\u0014\n                      from Christian and para-Christian Westerners, \nversions of this\u0014\n                      story in various aspects have functioned as \n\"good dreams,\"\u0014\n                      preparing minds and hearts for the reality of \nChrist according\u0014\n                      to the gospel. With increasing clarity, Lewis \nsaw his own\u0014\n                      fiction as adding to this stock of material. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The combination within him\u0014\n                      of insight with vitality,\u0014\n                      wisdom with wit, and imaginative\u0014\n                      power with analytical precision\u0014\n                      made Lewis a sparkling communicator\u0014\n                      of the everlating gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis knew that by becoming fact in Christ, the \nworldwide\u0014\n                      myth had not ceased to be a story that, by its \nappeal to our\u0014\n                      imagination, can give us \"a taste for the \nother\"a sense of\u0014\n                      reality, that is, which takes us beyond \nleft-brain conceptual\u0014\n                      knowledge. He found that what he now knew as \nthe fact of\u0014\n                      Christ was generating and fertilizing within \nhim stories of the\u0014\n                      same shapestories, that is, that picture \nredemptive action\u0014\n                      in worlds other than ours, whether in the past, \npresent, or\u0014\n                      future. In the fantasy novels (Out of the \nSilent Planet,\u0014\n                      Perelandra, That Hideous Strength, Till We Have \nFaces, and\u0014\n                      the seven Narnias) he became what Tolkien \ncalled a\u0014\n                      \"sub-creator,\" producing good dreams of his own \nthat, by\u0014\n                      reflecting Christian fact in a fantasy world, \nmight prepare\u0014\n                      hearts to embrace the truth of Christ. The \nvision of wholeness\u0014\n                      that these myths project, and of the \nGod-figures through\u0014\n                      whom that wholeness comes (think here \nparticularly of Aslan,\u0014\n                      the Christly lion), can stir in honest hearts \nthe wish that\u0014\n                      something of this sort might be true, and so \nbeget, under\u0014\n                      God, readiness to accept the revelation that \nsomething of this\u0014\n                      sort is true, as a matter of fact. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis once described The Lion, the Witch and \nthe Wardrobe\u0014\n                      as giving an answer to the question, \"What \nmight Christ be\u0014\n                      like if there really were a world like Narnia \nand he chose to be\u0014\n                      incarnate and die and rise again in that world \nas he actually\u0014\n                      has done in ours?\" All the Narnia books \nelaborate that\u0014\n                      answer: Aslan's doings are a reimagining in \nanother world of\u0014\n                      what Jesus Christ did, does, and will do in \nthis one. George\u0014\n                      Sayer, Lewis's finest biographer, ends his \nchapter on Narnia\u0014\n                      by telling how \"my little stepdaughter, after \nshe had read all\u0014\n                      the Narnia stories, cried bitterly, saying, 'I \ndon't want to go on\u0014\n                      living in this world. I want to live in Narnia \nwith Aslan'\"and\u0014\n                      then adding the five-word paragraph: \"Darling, \none day you\u0014\n                      will.\" The power of Lewisian myth as Christian \ncommunication\u0014\n                      could not be better shown, and countless \nbelievers who have\u0014\n                      nourished their children on Narnia will \nresonate with Sayer\u0014\n                      here. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor is that all. Over and above its \nevangelistic, or\u0014\n                      pre-evangelistic, role, Lewisian myth has an \neducating and\u0014\n                      maturing purpose. Lewis's 1943 Durham \nUniversity lectures,\u0014\n                      published as The Abolition of Man (whew!) with \nthe cooler\u0014\n                      academic subtitle, \"Reflections on education \nwith special\u0014\n                      reference to the teaching of English in the \nupper forms of\u0014\n                      schools,\" is a prophetic depth charge (it has \nbeen called a\u0014\n                      harangue) embodying his acute concern about our\u0014\n                      educational and cultural future. Lewis's \neducational\u0014\n                      philosophy called for imaginative \nidentification on the part of\u0014\n                      young people, with paths of truth and value \nforeshadowed in\u0014\n                      the Platonic tradition, focused in the biblical \nrevelation, and\u0014\n                      modeled in such writings as Spenser's Faerie \nQueene and his\u0014\n                      own stories; and The Abolition of Man was the \nwaving of a red\u0014\n                      flag at an oncoming juggernaut that would \nreduce education\u0014\n                      to the learning of techniques and so dehumanize \nand destroy\u0014\n                      it, tearing out of it that which is its true \nheart. (Could he\u0014\n                      inspect public education today, a half-century \nlater, he would\u0014\n                      tell us that what he feared has happened.) His \nfiction,\u0014\n                      however, was meant to help in real education, \nmoral aesthetic\u0014\n                      and spiritualvalue-laden education, in other \nwordsand it is\u0014\n                      from that standpoint that we look at it now. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A close-up on Lewis's philosophy of education \nis needed\u0014\n                      here. Its negative side is hostility to any \nreductionist\u0014\n                      subjectivizing of values, as if the words that \nexpress them\u0014\n                      signify not realities to discern and goals to \npursue, but just\u0014\n                      feelings of like and dislike that come and go. \nAs a long-term\u0014\n                      Platonist and now a Christian into the bargain, \nLewis had for\u0014\n                      some time been troubled by the lurching of \ntwentieth-century\u0014\n                      philosophy into this subjectivism, and The \nAbolition of Man\u0014\n                      begins as his assault on a school textbook that \nassumed it.\u0014\n                      Such subjectivizing, he says, produces \"men \nwithout chests\";\u0014\n                      that is, adults who lack what he calls \n\"emotions organized by\u0014\n                      trained habit into stable sentiments\"what we \nwould call\u0014\n                      moral formation and moral character. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Positively, Lewis calls for adherence to the \nTao (his term: Tao\u0014\n                      means way). The Tao is the basic moral code \n(beneficence,\u0014\n                      obligations and respect within the family, \njustice, truthfulness,\u0014\n                      mercy, magnanimity) that all significant \nreligions and all\u0014\n                      stable cultures maintain, and that Christians \nrecognize from\u0014\n                      the first two chapters of Romans as matters of \nGod's general\u0014\n                      revelation to our race. Lewis sees this code as \na unity, and\u0014\n                      as time-honored and experientially verified \nwisdom, and as\u0014\n                      the only safeguard of society in this or any \nage, so it is no\u0014\n                      wonder that he states its claim emphatically. \nCommenting on\u0014\n                      the fact that would-be leaders of thought \ndismiss some or all\u0014\n                      of the Tao in order to construct alternative \nmoralities (think of\u0014\n                      Nietzsche, for instance), he declares: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           This thing which I have called for \nconvenience\u0014\n                           the Tao, and which others may call Natural \nLaw\u0014\n                           or Traditional Morality or the First \nPrinciples of\u0014\n                           Practical Reason or the First Platitudes \nis not\u0014\n                           one among a series of possible systems of\u0014\n                           value. It is the sole source of all value\u0014\n                           judgments. The effort to refute it and \nraise a\u0014\n                           new system of value in its place is\u0014\n                           self-contradictory. What purport to be new\u0014\n                           systems or (as they now call them) \n'ideologies',\u0014\n                           all consist of fragments from the Tao \nitself,\u0014\n                           arbitrarily wrenched from their context in \nthe\u0014\n                           whole and then swollen to madness in their\u0014\n                           isolation, yet still owing to the Tao and \nto it\u0014\n                           alone such validity as they possess. If my \nduty\u0014\n                           to my parents is a superstition, then so \nis my\u0014\n                           duty to posterity. If the pursuit of \nscientific\u0014\n                           knowledge is a real value, then so is \nconjugal\u0014\n                           fidelity. The rebellion of new ideologies \nagainst\u0014\n                           the Tao is a rebellion of the branches \nagainst\u0014\n                           the tree: if the rebels could succeed they \nwould\u0014\n                           find that they had destroyed themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis's novel That Hideous Strength, which \ntells of a devilish\u0014\n                      research organization called the n.i.c.e. \ntaking over a British\u0014\n                      university in order to take over Britain in the \nname of science,\u0014\n                      seems to me as to others an artistic failure, \nbut it is a striking\u0014\n                      success in the way that it pictures this \nprocess of moral\u0014\n                      rebellion and the self-destruction to which it \nleadsand that, I\u0014\n                      suspect, was the only success that Lewis cared \nabout when\u0014\n                      he wrote it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now, Tao-orientation is an internalized mindset \nthat has to be\u0014\n                      learned. Lewis invokes Plato on this: \"The \nlittle human animal\u0014\n                      will not at first have the right responses. It \nmust be trained to\u0014\n                      feel pleasure, liking, disgust and hatred at \nthose things which\u0014\n                      really are pleasant, likable, disgusting, and \nhateful.\" Yes, but\u0014\n                      how? Partly, at least, through stories that \nmodel the right\u0014\n                      responses: poems like Spenser's Faerie Queene, \none of\u0014\n                      Lewis's lifelong favorites (best read, he once \naffirmed,\u0014\n                      between the ages of 12 and 16), novels like \nthose of George\u0014\n                      MacDonald, and myths like the Chronicles of \nNarnia. Doris\u0014\n                      Myers urges that the chronicles are a more or \nless conscious\u0014\n                      counterpart to the Faerie Queene, modeling \nparticular forms\u0014\n                      of virtue in a Tao frame with Christian \novertones across the\u0014\n                      spectrum of a human life. Affirming that \"the \ndidacticism of\u0014\n                      the Chronicles consists in the education of \nmoral and\u0014\n                      aesthetic feelingsto prevent children growing \nup without\u0014\n                      Chests,\" Myers reviews them to show how in each \none \"a\u0014\n                      particular virtue or configuration of virtues \nis presented, and\u0014\n                      the reader is brought to love it through \nparticipating in the\u0014\n                      artistry of the tale.\" The child will thus \nabsorb the Tao by\u0014\n                      osmosis through enjoying the story. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Specifically: in the first chronicle, The Lion, \nthe Witch and the\u0014\n                      Wardrobe, Lewis works to \"strengthen the Chest\" \nby inducing\u0014\n                      an emotional affirmation of courage, honor, and \nlimitless\u0014\n                      kindness, with an emotional rejection of \ncowardice and\u0014\n                      treachery. In Prince Caspian, the second, he \nhighlights joy\u0014\n                      within responsible self-control, in courtesy, \njustice,\u0014\n                      appropriate obedience, and the quest for order. \nIn the third,\u0014\n                      The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the endragoning \nand\u0014\n                      dedragoning of Eustace, \"the Boy without a \nChest,\" is flanked\u0014\n                      by vivid images of personal nobility \n(Reepicheep the Mouse)\u0014\n                      and public responsibility (Caspian the \ncaptain), while a\u0014\n                      tailpiece tells us how Eustace after his \ndedragoning was seen\u0014\n                      to be improved\"you'd never know him for the \nsame boy.\"\u0014\n                      (The image, of course, is of Christian \nconversion.)

Eighteen million people tuned \nin to NBC for\u0014\n                      the new football league's opening night. \nConsidering all the\u0014\n                      players are NFL rejects, that is an astonishing \nfigure; it is\u0014\n                      also a disquieting sign of the continued \ncoarsening of\u0014\n                      American culture. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      XFL is the brainchild of Vince McMahon of the \nWorld\u0014\n                      Wrestling Federation, and he's promising to do \nfor football\u0014\n                      what he did for wrestling. For those who care \nabout civility, it\u0014\n                      sounds more like a threat. Why? Because the x \nin XFL\u0014\n                      stands for extreme, as in extreme violence, \nsex, and\u0014\n                      \"attitude.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The \"attitude\"the deliberate flouting of \nauthority and\u0014\n                      conventionwas established by none other than \nJesse\u0014\n                      Ventura and other celebrities promoting the new \nleague on\u0014\n                      NBC. The game opens not with the traditional \ncoin toss, but\u0014\n                      with a mad scramble for the ball, making it the \nonly sport in\u0014\n                      which you can get knocked out before the game \neven starts.\u0014\n                      Players openly use four-letter \nvulgaritieswords easily\u0014\n                      recognizable despite being bleeped out.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As with wrestling, sex is big. Buxom \ncheerleaders dispense\u0014\n                      with pom-poms and plunge into the stands, \ndancing\u0014\n                      suggestively with fans while the TV cameras \nroll. Adding vice\u0014\n                      to vulgarity, McMahon says he will ask \ncheerleaders if their\u0014\n                      sexual relationships with players are hampering \nthe guys'\u0014\n                      performance on the field.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ironically, the same week the XFL debuted, the \nKaiser Family\u0014\n                      Foundation released findings from its study of \nsex on TV: 68\u0014\n                      percent of all prime-time programming, and 84 \npercent of\u0014\n                      situation comedies, contain sexual content; 10 \npercent offer\u0014\n                      \"strong suggestions\" of sexual intercourse.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The coarsening of our culture is evident in our \ndiscourse as\u0014\n                      well. For example, news journals defer to our \nsensitivities, not\u0014\n                      by omitting vulgarities, as they once did, but \nby using three\u0014\n                      dashes after the first letter of offensive \nwords. Really clever.\u0014\n                      Over the water cooler at work or in school \ncorridors, no one\u0014\n                      seems embarrassed anymore by conversations \nsprinkled with\u0014\n                      four-letter words.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nowhere is this coarsening more evident than in \nour dress.\u0014\n                      I'm used to being an anachronismthe only \nperson on an\u0014\n                      airplane wearing a coat and tie. Yes, I know \nbusiness is going\u0014\n                      casual. But T-shirts stretched over protruding \nbellies, shorts\u0014\n                      exposing hairy legs, and toes sprouting out of \nsandals are not\u0014\n                      casualthey're slovenly. And you see it more \nand more on\u0014\n                      airplanes, in restaurants, and even in church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How we present ourselves to others says \nsomething about\u0014\n                      how we view ourselves. When I was a Marine, we \nchecked\u0014\n                      our spit-shined shoes and starched khakis in a \nfull-length\u0014\n                      mirror before leaving the barracks; it was \ndrilled into us that if\u0014\n                      we were to be sharp we had to look sharp. \nThat's the right\u0014\n                      kind of pride, the antidote to sloth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The sin of sloth, as the late British \njournalist Henry Fairlie\u0014\n                      wrote in \"The Seven Deadly Sins,\" is \"a state \nof dejection that\u0014\n                      gives rise to torpor of mind and feeling and \nspirit; to a\u0014\n                      sluggishness. a poisoning of the will; to \ndespair,\u0014\n                      faintheartedness, and even desirousness. even \nfor what is\u0014\n                      good. sloth is a deadly sin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How have we arrived at this state? In his \"A \nStudy of History,\"\u0014\n                      the great historian Arnold Toynbee contends \nthat one clear\u0014\n                      sign of a civilization's decline is when \nlitespeople Toynbee\u0014\n                      labels the \"dominant minority\"begin mimicking \nthe vulgarity\u0014\n                      and promiscuity exhibited by society's \nbottom-dwellers. This\u0014\n                      is precisely what some political leaders and \nmost media\u0014\n                      moguls have done. The result: The entire \nculture is vulgarized.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christians need to be conscious of the subtle \nways in which\u0014\n                      our culture is sinking into sloth. We must \nresist the slide by\u0014\n                      creating strong countercultural influences. We \ncan start by\u0014\n                      elevating our own standards in speech and \ndress. One good\u0014\n                      place to start is in our worship services. I \nrealize that casual\u0014\n                      is \"in\" for contemporary servicesbut \"casual\" \nshould be\u0014\n                      decorous.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, we should cultivate higher tastes. \nChristian art and\u0014\n                      music should not mimic even the styles of their \ndegraded\u0014\n                      secular counterparts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The apostle Paul could not have imagined, \nsitting in a Roman\u0014\n                      jail cell, how appropriate his words to the \nchurch in Philippi\u0014\n                      would be for Christians 2,000 years later: \n\"Whatever is true,\u0014\n                      whatever is noble, whatever is pure, whatever \nis lovely,\u0014\n                      whatever is admirableif anything is excellent \nor\u0014\n                      praiseworthy, think about such things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nothing less than thinking about such things \nand acting upon\u0014\n                      them can rescue our culture from slouching into \nsloth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014\n                      Click here for reprint information on \nChristianity Today.\u0014\n                      April 23, 2001, Vol. 45, No. 6, Page 120\u0014",

She was appalled that so many \ntouted books\u0014\n                      with naturalistic themes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Julie picked up one of the booksa Berenstein \nBears\u0014\n                      titleand showed the moms the page that read, \n\"Nature is all\u0014\n                      there is, ever was, or ever will be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      They didn't get it. The moms were too young to \nremember\u0014\n                      Carl Sagan or the famous line from his book and \nfilm,\u0014\n                      Cosmos: \"The cosmos is all there is, all there \never was, and\u0014\n                      all there ever will be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"How do we wake people up?\" Julie asked in her \nletter.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Good question. If the polls are correct, \nforeign ideas have\u0014\n                      penetrated not only children's books but our \nmost basic\u0014\n                      beliefs. Gallup reports that 20 percent of \nborn-again Christians\u0014\n                      believe in reincarnation and 26 percent in \nastrology. Forty-five\u0014\n                      percent of those George Barna classifies as \nborn again\u0014\n                      believe that \"if people are good enough they \ncan earn a place\u0014\n                      in heaven.\" And Wade Clark Roof in Spiritual \nMarketplace\u0014\n                      writes that half of born-again baby boomers \nbelieve all\u0014\n                      religions are \"equally good and true,\" almost \nhalf have no\u0014\n                      involvement in a conservative Protestant \nchurch, and a quarter\u0014\n                      believe in communicating with the dead!\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Admittedly, poll data can be ambiguous, and the \nterm born\u0014\n                      again has certainly been trivialized. Still, \nthe data paint a\u0014\n                      shocking picture of the state of evangelical \nChristianity. On\u0014\n                      any Sunday, an alarming number who fill our \npews are either\u0014\n                      biblically illiterate or, worse, syncretists.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How can we explain this? Roof offers one \nanswer: boomers\u0014\n                      tend to substitute feelings for objective \nreality, seeking\u0014\n                      self-centered spirituality over the structured \ndemands of\u0014\n                      organized religion. With self-fulfillment their \nstandard, they\u0014\n                      pick and choose, as if at a salad bar, from any \nbelief system\u0014\n                      that provides comfort or meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The problem is that \"salad-bar Christianity\" \noften goes\u0014\n                      unchallenged by the larger Christian community. \nSome\u0014\n                      seeker-driven churches are reluctant to \nconfront such\u0014\n                      syncretism and thus scare people away.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The spirit of the age shuns absolutes, and this \nhas weakened\u0014\n                      the church's capacity to raise such challenges \neven if we\u0014\n                      were disposed to. A seminary dean told me his \nstudents all\u0014\n                      say they believe in absolute truth, but at the \nsame time are\u0014\n                      reluctant to \"impose\" their views. Serious \nlaity are even less\u0014\n                      inclined to challenge one another in today's \nrelativistic\u0014\n                      environment, for fear of being thought of as \nintolerant or\u0014\n                      bigoted. Mark Dever, pastor of Washington's \nCapitol Hill\u0014\n                      Baptist Church, sums up the problem bluntly: \n\"The church\u0014\n                      has lost the capacity to judge between good and \nevil, truth\u0014\n                      and falsehood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pastors I've consulted agree that there is a \nproblem and\u0014\n                      believe the answer is in better expository \npreaching. That is\u0014\n                      needed, but I question whether this alone will \nturn the tide.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      To teach believers to be discerning demands a \nsystemic effort\u0014\n                      to examine how Christianity stacks up against \nother claims in\u0014\n                      every area of life. When worldviews are \nhonestly compared,\u0014\n                      the truth of Christianity (and the untruth of \nother views)\u0014\n                      becomes clear.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is vital that Christians become more \ndiscriminating.\u0014\n                      Discerning Christians would have clearly seen \nthe pagan\u0014\n                      presuppositions behind that statement in the \nBerenstein\u0014\n                      Bears book that so many moms unthinkingly \nembraced. As\u0014\n                      Julie discovered, believers may understand \nScripture but still\u0014\n                      not recognize naturalistic claims that \nundermine biblical\u0014\n                      belief.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most importantly, when we discern what is false \nwe must\u0014\n                      have the courage to label it as such. Some \nseekers might be\u0014\n                      driven away, but better that than the insidious \nspread of\u0014\n                      syncretism within the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The church today needs to take a lesson from \none of the\u0014\n                      heroic figures of a century ago. Alarmed by the \nrise of\u0014\n                      modernism and false teachings spreading even in \nevangelical\u0014\n                      churches, New Testament scholar J. Gresham \nMachen\u0014\n                      published a scathing attack in his classic, \nChristianity and\u0014\n                      Liberalism. Machen argued that the beliefs many \nwere\u0014\n                      embracing weren't simply a new version of \nChristianity; rather,\u0014\n                      they constituted another religion altogether. \nThe book was a\u0014\n                      sobering jolt to many Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So too we should label today's syncretism \nanother religion.\u0014\n                      Much of what passes for born-again Christianity \nmay suit the\u0014\n                      spirit of the age, but it isn't authentic \nChristianity. This truth\u0014\n                      needs to be communicated both to those in the \npews and\u0014\n                      those in our pulpits as well.\u0014",

The safest plan may be to \nconcentrate on getting your share of investments, pensions, \nretirement plans and health benefits.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  This is especially true for women after middle-age, \nwhose ability to get a good-paying job, much less amass a portfolio \nsubstantial enough for old-age income, is typically limited.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Statistically, more than 20 percent of divorced \nolder women live in poverty, higher than for widows and never-married \nolder women.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  This problem could worsen in the next two decades \nas the number of retirement-age women increases by some 80 percent to \nmore than 9 million.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The average marriage lasts seven years, but \ndivorced women who stay married more than 10 years can face problems \nbecause they qualify for only half of their ex-spouse's Social \nSecurity benefit.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  As grim as that sounds, there are things you can do \nto protect yourself before you divorce, says Janet Bontemps \nBenedetti, a certified financial planner and certified divorce \nplanner with American Express Financial Advisors.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In essence, you can plan for divorce. Even if your \nmarriage heals, you'll be better off for understanding family \nfinances and investments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Many women, even though they know their marriage is \nheaded for the rocks, don't get ready for impact.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"My subjective opinion is that if you're concerned \nabout the stability of your marriage, sometimes making inquiries can \nfurther accelerate things before you're sure you want divorce to \nhappen,\" Benedetti said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But you can quietly set about understanding your \nfinancial situation, so if the worst happens, you're prepared.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"It's really important that both people participate \nin the decision-making, though not necessarily the\u0014\n                  day-to-day management. It's just good communication \nthat both participate and know what each other's\u0014\n                  assets and plans are,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Working women shouldn't earn money and turn it over \nto mates without knowing where it's going, how it's\u0014\n                  invested and what the long-term plans are.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Learn the basics of investments: \"Understand \ngenerally how investments grow, what a mutual fund is and\u0014\n                  how it can help your retirement,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But what if you don't have a clue about such \nmatters and your marriage is disintegrating?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Don't mention \"divorce.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"If you're in a phase where you're worried, start \ngathering copies of everything, because you don't know what\u0014\n                  you're going to need or when you'll need it,\" \nBenedetti said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Document your spouse's financial package from work. \nCopy occasional pay stubs; investment statements;\u0014\n                  savings and checking account statements; annual \nretirement, flexible spending account and benefits\u0014\n                  reports; health, disability and life insurance \npolicies; and credit union state-ments.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"The tax return is a major source of information. \nKeep copies of the return and of the supporting documents\u0014\n                  because they reveal more of what somebody's doing, \nsuch as actively putting money into a 401(k).\u0014\n                  Someone's income may be $110,000 on the tax return, \nbut it's really $120,000 because $10,000 is going\u0014\n                  into the savings plan.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Keep a record of your personal, child, household \nand incidental expenses. Store gathered information in a\u0014\n                  safe place.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Watch for unexplained spending habits or drains on \nincomes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Having documentation is easier, cheaper, faster and \nless frustrating than waiting for someone to produce\u0014\n                  records.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Besides, the information may be altered by the time \nyou see it. For example, \"there may have been $50,000\u0014\n                  in a mutual fund and now there's $10,000. Instead \nof second-guessing everything, you have proof,\" Benedetti\u0014\n                  said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Establish credit and get a job.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Homemakers with outdated or minimal skills are \nespecially vulnerable in divorce after midlife, said Carol\u0014\n                  A.N. Breit, a Richmond lawyer specializing in \nwomen's issues.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"The opportunities and the way people look at you - \nyour marketability - are different in your late 40s, 50s\u0014\n                  and 60s,\" Breit said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"If you don't have skills, sometimes you have to \nstart out in a boring job. I see women when everything they\u0014\n                  counted on is - boom - gone. It's like somebody \npulled the rug from beneath them and they hit their head. It\u0014\n                  takes them longer to regroup than when you're 27.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Be honest and upfront. Benedetti said she made an \nethical decision to not tell people how to hide assets.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Divorce may be fairly inexpensive and noncombative, \nshe said, but with underhanded depletion or hiding of\u0014\n                  holdings, \"you end up sitting in front of a judge, \nand that's costly, legally, financially and emotionally.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  If you reach the point where you have decided to \ndivorce, take steps to minimize damage, she\u0014\n                  recommends.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Joint cardholders are individually responsible for \npaying off credit-card balances. But you can limit charges.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  For example, \"if you have a joint credit card with \na $10,000 limit and a $2,000 balance, you can call the\u0014\n                  credit-card company and have the credit limit \nreduced to the current balance. That you don't need two\u0014\n                  signatures to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"On all joint title holdings, such as savings, \nchecking and stock accounts, you can contact the financial\u0014\n                  institution and say that you want instructions on \nthe account that [require] any withdrawals over a certain\u0014\n                  amount, such as $100, be authorized by both people \nto prevent big damage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Make sure that the ability to make telephone \nredemptions is halted, and that withdrawals must be done in\u0014\n                  writing with two signatures.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Some companies allow employees to make withdrawals \non their retirement plans or loans on their 401(k)\u0014\n                  plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"You can notify the company plan administrator that \nthere's an impending divorce and to freeze those kinds\u0014\n                  of activities until there is an agreement. Some \ncompanies won't allow such a freeze, but try to cover all the\u0014\n                  bases and do the best you can,\" Benedetti said. \n\"It's much harder to recoup damage that's been done - like\u0014\n                  accounts that have been emptied. Preventing \nproblems is a lot easier than trying to get the money back.\u0014\n                  You've got to fight harder.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Minimize opportunities to run up debt.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"If you have a home-equity line of credit, shrink \nthe line of credit to the current balance. It may require two\u0014\n                  signatures to close the home-equity line, but \neither person can protect themselves from financial damage,\"\u0014\n                  she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  For instance, \"if you have a zero credit balance \nand a $50,000 credit line and you're worried about loans,\u0014\n                  restrict the balance to $2,000 or so.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  You can do the same with jointly held credit cards.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  While you can't control accounts that don't have \nyour name on them, such as business accounts,\u0014\n                  document their existence. \"If a pot of money \nevaporates, it's important to be able to prove it exists. You may\u0014\n                  be able to get half of it back.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The more organized you are and the more copies of \ndocuments you can give your attorney, the better he or\u0014\n                  she can help you and the cheaper the assistance \nwill be.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  To find a good lawyer who understands women's legal \nissues, \"ask people who you trust and who have been\u0014\n                  through a divorce. Interview more than one person. \nDon't use your husband's lawyer. Each needs his own.\u0014\n                  The lawyer is the advocate for whoever hires them. \nIf you go to your husband's lawyer, he's not responsible\u0014\n                  for telling you what's in your best interest. \nSaving money by using the same lawyer is a mistake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  It would be forward thinking, Benedetti said, if \nyou're worried about the possibility of divorce to consult a\u0014\n                  certified divorce planner who can help with prevent \nor minimize ramifications that could lead to penury.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"If you're already divorced, you need a good \ncomprehensive financial planner. The adviser will point out the\u0014\n                  risks in your financial situation,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  For instance, if you're on spousal or child support \nwithout insurance to guarantee continued income if your\u0014\n                  ex dies, then you might need to own life insurance \non the other person. You have to get permission from the\u0014\n                  person even if you pay for the premium.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Or you might \"ask for a lump sum buyout as part of \nthe divorce decree if there's a flight risk or you're worried\u0014\n                  whether the check's going to show up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"The more that you can design it so that you're \nindependent of each other, the better. Avoid the financial ties\u0014\n                  that bind,\" Benedetti said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But these options, like every decision, need to be \ntailored to individual needs and specific situations,\u0014\n                  Benedetti and Breit said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Avoid making binding decisions based on generalized \nhow-to-plan information, they caution.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"There's a danger that people don't realize in not \ngetting proper expert advice,\" Breit said. \"It's the same as\u0014\n                  trying to treat an open wound by yourself based on \ngeneralized information.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Don't allow yourself to be browbeaten into not \ngetting expert help or into settling for crumbs, added Susanne\u0014\n                  L. Shilling, a family practice lawyer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Just realize that divorce is war. Don't think that \ndivorce is a situation where your best interests will be\u0014\n                  considered or the other side will be compromising,\" \nshe said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But Shilling also noted that once women accept that \ndivorce, no matter how traumatic, is another of life's\u0014\n                  chapters, they can thrive.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I've watched women who are like rags thrown away \ninto the street with low self-esteem and feeling\u0014\n                  destroyed, and they go through the process of \ndivorce and walk out the other end emancipated and willing\u0014\n                  to start another chapter with motivation and \nself-direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"They can come out whole.

Mueller, the Gestapo\u0014\nchief, is of particular interest because documents indicate he was \ntaken into U.S. cus-\u0014\ntody in 1945, and there is speculation that he may have lived on as a \nU.S. intelligence asset.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe documents shed light on Adolf Hitler and Nazis who made deals \nafter the war. In 10,000 pages released under the auspices of a group \nof historians and U.S.officials, these disclosures stand out:\u0014\n\u0014\n+ In 1934, Hitler ordered the murder of his close friend, Nazi Party \nchief organizer Gregor Strasser. Though the Nazis caled it a suicide, \nHitler told an insurance company to pay Strasser's widow 20,000 \nreichsmarks. He then directed the party to reimburse the company and \npay Strass er's children 6,000 reichsmarks a year until the age of 18.\u0014\n\u0014\n+ U.S. intelligence learned in 1944 that Hitler's personal physician, \nFerdinand Sauerbruch, described him in 1937 as hinging between genius \nand insanity and speculated that Hitler could become \"the craziest \ncriminal the world ever saw.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n+ Six days before Germany's defeat, SS officers in Northern Italy \nnegotiated their surrender with Allen Dulles, then chief of U.S. \nintelligence in Switzerland. \"They re-created themselves as \nmessengers of  peace,\" says University of Virginia historian Timothy \nNaftali. He argues that the of ficers were war criminals who sealed \ntheir immunity from postwar prosecution.\u0014\n\u0014\n+ A 600-page file on ss Major Wilhelm Hoettl reveals he peddled \nintelligence for 12 governments, including the Soviet Union, \nYugoslavia, West Germany, and \"the the Vatican. A prime mover in the \ndeportation of Hungarian Jews in 1944, Hoettl was later hired by U.S. \nArmy intelligence to craft an espionage ring in Soviet-occupied \nHungary. Never prosecuted, he died a wealthy man in 1997.\u0014\n\u0014\n+Nine former Nazis suspected of war crimes had at least some ties to \nWest Germany's key intelligence agency, the Gehlen Organization, \ncreated and initially controlled by U.S. Army intelligence. \"U.S. \nintelligence agencies believed 'We can use them but we cannot trust \nthem,' \" says Ohio University Prof. Norman Goda. '\"The moral question \nwas never asked, 'Should we?' It was a strictly an operational \nissue.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLES FENYVESI AND DAN GILGOFF  U.S. News and World Report   \n5/7/01\u0014",

    "words": "Sikhism, History, beliefs, practices, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\n            The world's fifth largest religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh Origins:\u0014\n\u0014\n  No consensus exists on the origins of this religion. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Historians and specialists in Eastern religions generally \nbelieve that\u0014\n       Sikhism is a syncretistic religion, related to the Bhakti \nmovement within\u0014\n       Hinduism and the Sufi branch of Islam, to which many \nindependent\u0014\n       beliefs and practices were added.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Many Sikhs disagree; they believe that their religion is a \ndirect\u0014\n       revealed from God - a religion that was not derived from either\u0014\n       Hinduism or Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikhism does contain many unique postulates and principles that are \nquite\u0014\n  different from both Hinduism and Islam. Joseph D. Cunningham \n(1812-1851),\u0014\n  the author of \"A History of the Sikhs\" (1848), observed: \"It has \nbeen usual to\u0014\n  regard the Sikhs as essentially Hindu... yet in religious faith and \nworldly\u0014\n  aspiration, they are wholly different from other Indians, and they \nare bound\u0014\n  together by an objective unknown elsewhere.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh History:\u0014\n\u0014\n  The name of the religion means learner. It is often mispronounced \n'seek' It\u0014\n  should be pronounced 'se-ikh', with the final 'kh' sound like the \n'kh' in Mikhail\u0014\n  Gorbachev. \u0014\n\u0014\n  Its founder was Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, (1469-1538) who was born in \nthe\u0014\n  Punjab area of what is now Pakistan. At Sultanpur, he received a \nvision to\u0014\n  preach the way to enlightenment and God. He is responsible for the \nsaying\u0014\n  \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\" which has since become one \nof the\u0014\n  pillars of Sikhism. Guru Nanak and Panth (his followers) later \nbuilt the first\u0014\n  Sikh temple at Katarpur. \u0014\n\u0014\n  A succession of nine Gurus (regarded as reincarnations of Guru \nNanak) led\u0014\n  the movement during the period from Guru Nanak's death until 1708. \nAt that\u0014\n  time, the functions of the Guru passed to the Panth and to the holy \ntext,\u0014\n  considered the 11th Guru. \u0014\n\u0014\n  Mogul emperors ruled a large area of South Asia from the 16th \ncentury until\u0014\n  the end of the 18th century. They attempted to convert the Sikhs to \nIslam,\u0014\n  but were unsuccessful. It has been said of one of the Sikh Gurus\u0014\n  (considered by many Sikhs to have been the last guru) that \"Had \nthere been\u0014\n  no Guru Gobind Singh, the entire country would have gotten \ncircumcised\"\u0014\n  i.e. been converted to Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In 1801, the Sikh state of Punjab was founded in Northern India by \nMaharaja\u0014\n  Ranjit Singh. According to a historian Vincent Smith, \"The Punjab \nState was\u0014\n  neither a traditional Indian territorial State and monarchy, nor \nmerely a\u0014\n  dictatorship of one community over another. There was an element of\u0014\n  partnership with other communities.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n  An invasion by Great Britain triggered the Sikh Wars (1845-1849). \nThe\u0014\n  British successfully gained control over all of India. After \nindependence in\u0014\n  1947, occupied India was partitioned on religious grounds into a \nmostly\u0014\n  Muslim Pakistan and mostly Hindu India. A mass migration of Sikhs \nfrom\u0014\n  Pakistan to India and a reverse migration of Muslims resulted. The \nSikhs\u0014\n  have been seeking an independent homeland since the late 1940's. \u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikhs number about 22.5 million worldwide. 1 Most live in the \nPunjab. Close\u0014\n  to 500,000 live in North America, 1 of whom about 150,000 live in \nCanada. 2 \u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh Holy Texts:\u0014\n\u0014\n  The tenth Guru, Gobind Singh compiled the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. It\u0014\n  consists of hymns and writings of the first 10 Gurus, along with \nreligious text\u0014\n  from different Muslim and Hindu saints like: Kabir Ji, Baba Sheik \nFarid Ji,\u0014\n  Bhagat Namdev, Bhagat Rav Dass Ji, etc. The Shri Guru Granth is\u0014\n  considered the 11th and final Guru and the Sikh's holiest religious \ntext. It\u0014\n  was made so by Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. \"The Khalsa Consensus\u0014\n  Translation [of the Guru Granth Sahib]...is regarded by some Sikh \nscholars\u0014\n  as being among the finest and most accurate english translation \ncurrently\u0014\n  available.\" It is available online at  \nhttp://www.sikhs.org/english/frame.html \u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh Beliefs:\u0014\n\u0014\n  Beliefs include: \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n       Goal: The goal of Sikhs is to build a close, loving \nrelationship with\u0014\n       God.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Deity: Sikhs believe in a single, Formless God, with many \nnames, who\u0014\n       can be known through meditation.  This concept is similar to \nIslam\u0014\n       whose followers believe in a single God who has 99 names. They \ndo\u0014\n       not deny the existence of the countless Hindu deities. They \nconsider\u0014\n       God as having made many lesser gods and to be superior to \nthem.  \u0014\n\u0014\n       Worship: Only the one God can be worshipped; lesser gods are \nnot\u0014\n       worshipped.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Reincarnation: They believe in samsara (the repetitive cycle of\u0014\n       birth, life and death), karma (the accumulated sum of one's \ngood and\u0014\n       bad deeds, and reincarnation the belief of a rebirth following \ndeath.\u0014\n       These beliefs are similar to Hinduism.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Caste system: Sikhs have rejected the caste system of the Hindu\u0014\n       religion. They believe that everyone has equal status in the \neyes of\u0014\n       God. This is a very important principle that permeates all \nSikh belief\u0014\n       and behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Code of Conduct: During the 18th century, there were a number \nof\u0014\n       attempts to prepare an accurate portrayal of Sikh customs. None\u0014\n       received the support of most Sikhs. Sikh scholars and \ntheologians\u0014\n       started in 1931 to prepare the Reht Maryada -- the Sikh code of\u0014\n       conduct and conventions. It is \"the only version authorized by \nthe Akal\u0014\n       Takht, the seat of supreme temporal authority for Sikhs. It's\u0014\n       implementation has successfully achieved a high level of \nuniformity in\u0014\n       the religious and social practices of Sikhism\" 4 throughout \nthe world. It\u0014\n       contains 27 articles. Article 1 defines who is a Sikh: \u0014\n\u0014\n            \"Any human being who faithfully believes in\u0014\n            (i) One Immortal Being,\u0014\n            (ii) Ten Gurus, from Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind\u0014\n            Singh,\u0014\n            (iii) The Guru Granth Sahib,\u0014\n            (iv) The utterances and teachings of the ten Gurus and\u0014\n            (v) the baptism bequeathed by the tenth Guru, and who\u0014\n            does not owe allegiance to any other religion, is a \nSikh.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n       There are a number of traditions within Sikhism. Thousands of \nSikhs,\u0014\n       both in India and worldwide, follow living gurus who have \nlineages\u0014\n       traceable back to Guru Gobind Singh. In Canada and elsewhere,\u0014\n       major strains are becoming evident between liberal and \nconservative\u0014\n       wings of the religion, as some Sikhs accommodate to the \nsurrounding\u0014\n       culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh Practices:\u0014\n\u0014\n       Prayers: repeated multiple times each day.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Worship: Sikhs are prohibited from worshipping idols, images, \nor\u0014\n       icons.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Temples: There are over 200 Gurdwaras (temples, shrines or holy\u0014\n       places) in India alone. The most sacred is at Amritsar.\u0014\n\u0014\n       The Five K's: These are clothing practices followed by \nstricter Sikhs,\u0014\n       called Khalsa saints:\u0014\n\u0014\n         1.Kesa (long hair, which is never cut) \u0014\n         2.Kangah (comb) \u0014\n         3.Kacha (short pants) \u0014\n         4.Kara (metal bracelet) \u0014\n         5.Kirpan (a ceremonial dagger) \u0014\n\u0014\n  The Khanda -- the Sikh symbol\u0014\n\u0014\n  The Khanda is the main Sikh symbol. It is seen at the top of this \nessay, used\u0014\n  by permission of www.hatisoft.com 5 It is composed of five items, \nall\u0014\n  traditional Sikh weapons:\u0014\n\u0014\n       A vertical double edged sword with a broad blade, also called a\u0014\n       Khanda.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Two curved swords, called kirpans. They are called miri and \npiri, after\u0014\n       the names given to his personal kirpans by Guru Hargobind.\u0014\n\u0014\n       A rink called a chakker (aka chakram). It is a very effective \nweapon,\u0014\n       with a range of up to 50 meters (165 feet). This has been \npopularized\u0014\n       in North America by the television series Zena the Warrior.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The Khanda has been interpreted symbolically in many ways. one is:\u0014\n\u0014\n       \"The Sikh emblem, Khanda, contains a ring of steel\u0014\n       representing the Unity of God, a two edged sword symbolizing\u0014\n       God's concern for truth and justice, and two crossed swords\u0014\n       curved around the outside to signify God's spiritual power.\" 6\u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh Dispute Concerning Furniture:\u0014\n\u0014\n  A serious dispute has broken out among Sikhs in Canada. This has \nbeen\u0014\n  described in the media as a conflict between fundamentalists and \nmoderates\u0014\n  - terms that the media appears to have adapted from Christian \nterminology.\u0014\n  Sikhs do not use these terms. For example, conservative Sikhs \nrecognize: \u0014\n\u0014\n       Sikhs: those who accept and follow all Sikh beliefs and \npractices, and\u0014\n         \u0014\n       Non-practicing Sikhs: those who follow only some Sikh beliefs \nand\u0014\n       practices. For example, \"third and fourth generation Sikhs in \nEngland\u0014\n       and Canada are more likely to be into drinking \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein, smoking, \ncutting\u0014\n       their hair, and living a non-Sikh way of life than being a \npracticing\u0014\n       Sikh.\" 3\u0014\n\u0014\n  Many persons considered by observant Sikhs as \"non-practicing\" \nbelieve\u0014\n  that they have full status as Sikhs even though they have deviated \nfrom\u0014\n  some of their faith's traditional practices. We will use the terms\u0014\n  \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" in this essay to describe the two \ndivisions within\u0014\n  the Sikh faith group.\u0014\n\u0014\n  For 500 years, Sikhs had always sat on the floor, while eating \nafter religious\u0014\n  services. This practice emphasizes the teachings of the Guru that \nevery\u0014\n  person is of equal value. The Sikh religion strongly rejects \nelitism. A few\u0014\n  decades ago, some Sikh Temples in Canada deviated from this \npractice,\u0014\n  and introduced tables and chairs. The tables and chairs are made \nidentical\u0014\n  in order to preserve the concept of equality. Still, the practice \nof eating at\u0014\n  tables is considered elitism in India, and by many conservative \nSikhs.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In 1996, some Sikhs began calling for the removal of the tables and \nchairs,\u0014\n  and a return to floor sitting during meals. Some claim that the \ndispute over\u0014\n  the furniture is largely symbolic, and that the real reason for the \ndispute is\u0014\n  that many Sikhs are weakening their faith by accommodating to modern\u0014\n  practices. A riot broke out at the temple on 1997-JAN-11. Several \nSikhs have\u0014\n  been charged with various crimes, from mischief to attempted \nmurder. Many\u0014\n  were injured, but none died. \u0014\n\u0014\n  The Jathedar of the Akal Takhat Sahib is the spiritual & temporal \nleader of\u0014\n  Sikhs and the final authority in any religious disputes within the \nfaith. In\u0014\n  1998-APR, they issued a hukamnama (edict) against the use of \nfurniture in\u0014\n  Sikh Temples. They ruled that the furniture must be removed by\u0014\n  1998-MAY-29.  This ruling was appealed. Those opposing the ruling \ncited a\u0014\n  number of reasons why they prefer to not sit on the floor: the \ncolder\u0014\n  temperature in North America makes this uncomfortable, elderly \npeople find\u0014\n  the arrangement difficult, and younger members may refuse to be \nmarried in\u0014\n  the temple if they had to sit on the floor. Some Sikh societies in \nthe United\u0014\n  States and England agreed to write to the Jathedar in support of \nthe appeal.\u0014\n  The Ontario Gurudawaras Committee, which represents all 25 of the\u0014\n  province's temples, sent a letter to Bahai Ranjit Singh, Sikh's \nhighest priest,\u0014\n  calling his original ruling \"praiseworthy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  Sikh leaders asked members to remain calm until the matter is \nresolved.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The Akal Takhat reaffirmed the original edict. Thousands of Sikhs \nin the\u0014\n  Greater Vancouver area risked excommunication from their religion \nif they\u0014\n  sat at tables to have the ceremonial meal after prayers on \n1998-MAY-30.\u0014\n  Leaders of 21 Sikh societies in British Columbia and Alberta vowed \nto keep\u0014\n  the furniture. \u0014\n\u0014\n  By 1998-JUN-8, three reform priests had been suspended for defying \nthe\u0014\n  ban on tables and chairs. They have complained to the British \nColumbia\u0014\n  Human Rights Commission, stating that they have been discriminated\u0014\n  against on religious grounds. Meanwhile, most Sikh priests in the \nVancouver\u0014\n  area started a strike as of JUN-2 in order to persuade temple \nexecutives to\u0014\n  remove temple furniture.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In mid 1998-JUL, five or six prominent liberal Sikhs were summoned \nto\u0014\n  Amristar, India by JUL-25 to explain why they oppose a ban on \ntables and\u0014\n  chairs. The group included a newspaper editor, a priest and three \ntemple\u0014\n  executives. They did not appear and were excommunicated. On JUL-26, \na\u0014\n  disturbance broke out at North America's oldest Sikh temple: the \nRoss Street\u0014\n  Temple, established by the Khalsa Diwan Society in 1905. \nConservative\u0014\n  Sikhs tried to prevent a liberal, excommunicated executive member \nfrom\u0014\n  addressing the congregation. On AUG-2, the police shut down the \ntemple. It \u0014\n  remained closed until the police chief, Bruce Chambers, was able to \nbroker\u0014\n  an agreement between conservative and liberal Sikhs.\u0014\n\u0014\n  On 1998-NOV-18, Tara Hayer was killed by an unknown assassin. He was\u0014\n  an outspoken supporter of the liberal side, the publisher of a Sikh\u0014\n  newspaper, and one of the 6 who had been excommunicated. \u0014\n\u0014\n  During 1998-NOV and DEC, members voted in favor of liberal slates of\u0014\n  candidates for management positions within a number of Sikh temples \nin\u0014\n  British Columbia. Jarnail Singh Bhandal now heads the Ross Street \ntemple in\u0014\n  Vancouver. He has called for a peacemaking conference of all Sikh \nfactions\u0014\n  - the first community-wide meeting in several years.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The current Sikh Jathedar (leader) is Ranjit Singh. He had planned \na visit to\u0014\n  the United States in 1999-JAN.  Liberal Sikhs appear  concerned \nthat his visit\u0014\n  might inflame religious tensions in North America. They intervened \nwith the\u0014\n  U.S. authorities, pointing out that the Jathedar had served a \nlengthy jail term\u0014\n  in 1980 for murdering the leader of a rival religious sect, and \nthat he has\u0014\n  never renounced the use of violence against religious opponents. \nHis visa\u0014\n  was canceled at the last moment. A large ad in the Washington Post \ncalled\u0014\n  on the U.S. president to overrule the immigration authorities, \ncomparing Mr.\u0014\n  Singh's status among Sikhs as comparable to the Pope among Roman\u0014\n  Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Some Sikh web sites:\u0014\n\u0014\n       Sikhism Home Page is at: http://www.sikhs.org/ \u0014\n\u0014\n       Welcome to Khanda page is at:  http://khanda.unl.edu/~sikhism/\u0014\n       (The Khanda is the insignia of the Sikhs, a symbol \nrepresenting the\u0014\n       Universal Creative power).

Winner | posted 6/4/01\u0014\n                      I sat down in church on a recent Sunday, \nflipped through the\u0014\n                      bulletin, and saw that the readings for the day \nwere about\u0014\n                      marriage: Genesis 2:23-25 and Matthew 19:4-6. I \ngroaned. After a\u0014\n                      still-fresh breakup with a boyfriend, the last \nthing I wanted was to\u0014\n                      sit through another sermon on the joys of \nmatrimony. That sermon\u0014\n                      might apply to the 9 a.m. service, I thought, \nbut here at the 11:45\u0014\n                      service there are lots of single professionals. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To his credit, my pastor tried to make the \nsermon relevant to those\u0014\n                      of us who weren't married. And as I listened, I \nbecame persuaded\u0014\n                      that maybe I had something to learn. After all, \nI'm not a thief, but I\u0014\n                      can usually find something valuable in sermons \nabout stealing. He\u0014\n                      spoke about the responsibility of the community \nto support\u0014\n                      people's marriage vows; I could sign on to \nthat. But then he\u0014\n                      veered: \"This is not only germane to those of \nyou who are\u0014\n                      married,\" he said, \"but also to those of you on \nthe marriage market\u0014\n                      who are looking to be married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He could have stopped there, but instead he \nadded, \"Though,\u0014\n                      frankly, if you're single and Christian and you \nwant to get married,\u0014\n                      you're in the wrong cityunless you're male. \nIt's the same\u0014\n                      demographic story in all the churches in New \nYork City. We have\u0014\n                      many bright, interesting single women and not \ntoo many single\u0014\n                      men.\" He was trying, I think, to be funny. He \nfailed. All the single\u0014\n                      women in my pew cringed. A single man across \nthe aisle smirked.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I know what you're thinking: Another article by \na single Christian\u0014\n                      kvetching about how the church is so \ninsensitivehow her needs\u0014\n                      aren't being met, how she's not being \nrespected. Another single\u0014\n                      Christian demanding to have it both \nways\"Please fix me up with\u0014\n                      your cute nephew, but while you're at it, \nvalidate my singleness,\u0014\n                      and, whatever you do, don't make me feel like \nthere's something\u0014\n                      wrong with me because I'm not married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I hope this isn't another \"beat up on the \nchurch\" session. Not that I\u0014\n                      don't think there are areas in which the church \ncould improve its\u0014\n                      outreach to single adults. Sensitivity to \nsingle people is a problem\u0014\n                      that we should take seriously, if only because \nmany single\u0014\n                      Christians report they've stopped attending \nchurch because of\u0014\n                      jokes like the one my pastor attempted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The church is mostly unaware that there's even \na question to be\u0014\n                      asked,\" says Debra Farrington, author of One \nLike Jesus:\u0014\n                      Conversations on the Single Life (Loyola). \n\"Churches have\u0014\n                      unconsciously bought into the belief that being \nsingle is being\u0014\n                      miserable. They might pat singles' heads and \nsay it's okay, but\u0014\n                      they don't really believe that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For starters, we should give some thought to \nlanguage. Farrington,\u0014\n                      for instance, wonders why we call 20s and 30s \nfellowship groups\u0014\n                      \"pairs and spares.\" Judging by their \nvocabulary, many churches\u0014\n                      make unmarried Christians sound like an \nafterthought. Our words\u0014\n                      matternot only what we say, but what we don't \nsay.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The church doesn't realize how many people \navoid services\u0014\n                      because they are too focused on families and \nalienate singles,\"\u0014\n                      says Lana Trent, the 37-year-old coauthor of \nSingle and Content\u0014\n                      (Word). \"It doesn't take much to throw in an \nexample about\u0014\n                      singles. You can talk about someone's roommate \ninstead of their\u0014\n                      spouse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But sensitivity is not the main question. The \nmain question is, How\u0014\n                      do we think about singleness? Do single \nChristians have special\u0014\n                      needs? And, if so, how does the church go about \nmeeting them?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Redefining Singles Ministry\u0014\n                      When I moved to New York, I visited churches \nfor a year. One of\u0014\n                      the reasons I settled at the church I joined is \nthat it doesn't have a\u0014\n                      singles ministry. No one asked me to serve on \nthe worship team of\u0014\n                      the singles service or teach in the singles \nSunday-school class;\u0014\n                      my pastor instead asked me to serve on the \neducation committee.\u0014\n                      And no one invited me to a singles mixer; \ninstead, I mingle with\u0014\n                      married friends, engaged friends, widowed \nfriends, and other single\u0014\n                      twentysomethings at the church suppers on \nSunday evenings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I didn't want to be part of a singles ministry \nbecause the majority\u0014\n                      of my needs don't have anything to do with \nbeing single. I need\u0014\n                      prayer. I need to serve others. I need to be \nheld accountable for\u0014\n                      my sins. And I figure married people need those \nthings, too. I don't\u0014\n                      want to be segregated with people who, \nsuperficially, are just like\u0014\n                      me. The eye cannot say to the hand, after all, \n\"I don't need you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lots of single Christians don't agree with me. \nIndeed, a lot of my\u0014\n                      Christian friends, who go to different \nchurches, say they chose\u0014\n                      their church precisely because it offers a \nvital singles ministry.\u0014\n                      Singleness, they say, does come with special \nneeds, and thank\u0014\n                      God the church is recognizing that more than it \ndid 20 years ago\u0014\n                      and is responding.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sue Nilson, singles ministry pastor at \nGinghamsburg United\u0014\n                      Methodist Church, a large seeker-sensitive \ncongregation just north\u0014\n                      of Dayton, Ohio, has worked with single \nChristians for almost 15\u0014\n                      years. Good singles ministry isn't a holding \ntank where single\u0014\n                      Christians wallow in those issues, she says; it \nis \"a place to\u0014\n                      process them so that singles can then go on to \nbe great leaders\u0014\n                      for Christ, in the church and the world.\" Those \nissues include\u0014\n                      \"defining success in one's life.\" Sometimes the \nworld defines\u0014\n                      success as marriage, children, and a time-share \nin Florida. Single\u0014\n                      Christians have to think about retooling their \ndreams in a way that\u0014\n                      doesn't leave them \"bitter,\" says Nilson, and \nthe church can,\u0014\n                      should, and in many congregations is helping \nthem do that.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nilson, a single parent of a teenager, has \nbecome popular\u0014\n                      nationally as a seminar and conference speaker. \nShe is not so\u0014\n                      much interested in helping people celebrate \ntheir singleness as\u0014\n                      discovering their gifts. She believes that all \npeople can be a\u0014\n                      \"Michael Jordan\" at something, and it's just a \nmatter of providing\u0014\n                      them a stage for their talents to emerge. \nNilson was hired in 1998\u0014\n                      to start a singles ministry at St. Mark's \nUnited Methodist Church\u0014\n                      in Lincoln, Nebraska. (She recently left there \nto take the\u0014\n                      Ginghamsburg position.) She says the ministry \n\"grew like wildfire\"\u0014\n                      in the 4,000-member church and, within a few \nyears, the singles\u0014\n                      ministry had an outreach to the entire \nsoutheastern region of\u0014\n                      Nebraska.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Eventually the church statistician notified me \nthat our overall\u0014\n                      church membership had become 50 percent single \nadults,\" she\u0014\n                      recalls. \"Singles were chairing the \nadministration board, filling the\u0014\n                      churchwide committees for missions, music, \neducation,\u0014\n                      everythingas well as leading the many facets \nof the single adult\u0014\n                      ministry itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not everyone is as enthusiastic about singles \nministry as Nilson.\u0014\n                      Terry Hershey was once one of the country's \nleading singles\u0014\n                      ministers. In 1981 he joined the staff of \nRobert Schuller's Crystal\u0014\n                      Cathedral in southern California, and he \ncofounded the now defunct\u0014\n                      National Association of Single Adult Leaders. \nHis books and\u0014\n                      seminars established him as an authoritative \nvoice. But in the last\u0014\n                      20 years, he's done some rethinking on the \nsingles issue.\u0014\n                      \"Churches should never be divided along gender \nor marital or\u0014\n                      generational lines,\" he now says. \"As soon as \nwe ghettoize\u0014\n                      peopleOh I'm glad you're in our church today; \nare you single?\u0014\n                      Then go to room 207then we've done something \nwrong. The\u0014\n                      mistake we made 25 years ago, when churches \nwere first getting\u0014\n                      into singles ministry, was to assume that every \nchurch had to have\u0014\n                      a singles minister and a singles program.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hershey now believes churches don't need \nsingles ministers as\u0014\n                      much as singles advocates. And advocacy, he \nsays, \"has nothing\u0014\n                      to do with instituting a program. It has to do \nwith how we help\u0014\n                      provide childcare for single parents who are in \nour church. It has to\u0014\n                      do with how we plug people in who are single \nadults so they know\u0014\n                      they can serve here and have support here. \nThat's singles ministry.\u0014\n                      The churches that are doing that don't have a \nprogramthey don't\u0014\n                      have a class of 200 singles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Missing: A Theology of Sex\u0014\n                      There is one area where single Christians are \nstuck wrestling with\u0014\n                      an issue that is specifically related to their \nsingleness: it's not\u0014\n                      community or ministry; it's sex. While all \nChristians are called to\u0014\n                      chastity, for married folks that means \nforsaking all others besides\u0014\n                      their spouse. For the rest of us, it means \nforsaking sex, period.\u0014\n                      This is tough enough when you're 19 and single. \nIt's an even\u0014\n                      greater challenge if you're still singleor \nsingle againat 32. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As more Christians are single longer and \nlonger, we need to think\u0014\n                      about sex. The issue is not whether we want to \ncave into cultural\u0014\n                      pressures and toss the church's teachings about \nsexual morality\u0014\n                      out the window; instead it's why many single \nChristians do not give\u0014\n                      those teachings the time of day, and what we \ncan do to help\u0014\n                      people live chastely after, say, college. \"It's \ndifficult sexually to\u0014\n                      keep on keeping on as one year stretches into \nfive,\" says Julia\u0014\n                      Duin, 44, assistant national editor of The \nWashington Times and\u0014\n                      author of Purity Makes the Heart Grow Stronger \n(Servant).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Debra Farrington agrees. \"Sex is a complicated \nquestion, and we\u0014\n                      just don't speak about it. There should be an \nopportunity for\u0014\n                      conversation in the church, but the church is \ntoo busy seeing no\u0014\n                      evil and hearing no evil, so singles hang out \nalone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What we need, it seems, are at least three \nthings. First, we need\u0014\n                      venues for frank communication. A single \nChristian ought to be\u0014\n                      able to sit down with her pastor and say, \"My \nboyfriend and I are\u0014\n                      finding it harder to only go as far as kissing, \nand I'm not sure what\u0014\n                      to do about that,\" without fearing that he'll \nnever again take her\u0014\n                      seriously as a committed Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, we should not act like sex outside of \nmarriage is the\u0014\n                      unforgivable sin. A sin, indeed, but one of \nmany that Christians\u0014\n                      struggle with. It is likely that more \nChristians ignore the biblical\u0014\n                      prohibition against gossip than are engaging in \npremarital sex, but\u0014\n                      the church is more exercised about the latter \nissue than the\u0014\n                      former. When we place too much emphasis on one \nsin, we risk\u0014\n                      not only hypocrisy, but we also make it harder \nfor those guilty of\u0014\n                      that sin to come openly to the church for help.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, we need to do more than just point to \na couple of verses in\u0014\n                      Paul's epistles that warn against fornication; \nwe need to present\u0014\n                      single Christians with a whole theology of \nchastity and sexuality.\u0014\n                      \"We lack a sexual theology in the church,\" says \nBen Young,\u0014\n                      coauthor of The Ten Commandments of Dating \n(Thomas Nelson)\u0014\n                      and the singles pastor at Houston's Second \nBaptist Church. Sex\u0014\n                      inside marriage, he says, is a mere shadow of \nthe higher reality of\u0014\n                      oneness in the Trinitybut you don't hear a lot \nabout that on\u0014\n                      Sunday mornings. \"If we want people to give up \npremarital sex,\u0014\n                      we've got to do more than just getting into the \npulpit and saying,\u0014\n                      'No, don't.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Steve Tracy, a professor of theology and ethics \nat Phoenix\u0014\n                      Seminary, has spent years counseling young \nadults on\u0014\n                      relationship issues. He believes the \ndevelopment of a holistic\u0014\n                      \"sexual theology\" is deterred because \nevangelicals tend to\u0014\n                      segregate sexuality into something that only \nmarried people\u0014\n                      should be thinking about. \"We need to think of \nit as the whole of\u0014\n                      what we are as a man or woman,\" Tracy says. \n\"All of it belongs to\u0014\n                      God and should be developed under the lordship \nof Christ.\" He\u0014\n                      adds that the church should not send the tacit \nmessage that\u0014\n                      single people are somehow not sexual beings \nbecause they\u0014\n                      shouldn't be having sex. Instead, he says the \nchurch should\u0014\n                      encourage single Christians to \"celebrate the \nwhole of their\u0014\n                      maleness and femaleness in healthy, nonerotic \nways,\" such as\u0014\n                      spending time in coed fellowship groups where \nsingle people can\u0014\n                      experience the opposite sex in real, \nuncontrived situations. \"It\u0014\n                      won't erase the sexual pressures that they \nface, but it puts things\u0014\n                      in a positive framework.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Building a Better \"Meet Market\"\u0014\n                      When I start railing against singles \nministries, my other unmarried\u0014\n                      friends often look at me like I'm crazy. Not \nonly, they say, do\u0014\n                      singles groups provide them with a sense of \ncommunity with\u0014\n                      others who are wrestling with their unmarried \nstate; the groups\u0014\n                      also provide a place to meet potential dates. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      America's megachurches draw huge numbers not \njust because of\u0014\n                      the laid-back atmosphere and contemporary \nworship; large,\u0014\n                      bustling churches offer single Christians \ngreater opportunities to\u0014\n                      meet other single Christians. Indeed, the \nchurch is doing more\u0014\n                      now than ever before to help Christians find \nsuitable partners,\u0014\n                      which, if you aren't marrying your Christian \ncollege sweetheart,\u0014\n                      can be tough.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most of us single Christians spend the bulk of \nour weeks living and\u0014\n                      working in non-Christian settings.

Today, the\u0014\n                      site has about 25,000 members. \"There's \ntremendous pressure to\u0014\n                      meet and get married,\" he says, \"but no help on \nhow to do that.\u0014\n                      There are thousands and thousands of Christian \nsingles in\u0014\n                      Toronto, but the Christian singles events tend \nto be 'loser fests.'\u0014\n                      They just throw you in a room together and say, \n'Go to it.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Moorcroft, who is single, confesses to using \nChristianCaf.com\u0014\n                      himself. He hasn't met his future wife yet, but \nhe estimates that\u0014\n                      about 200 people have gotten hitched using his \nsite. He admits\u0014\n                      that online matchmaking isn't perfect. \"A lot \nof women over 50 are\u0014\n                      having trouble meeting people on the site \nbecause men over 50\u0014\n                      want thirtysomething women. That social stigma \nof men dating\u0014\n                      older women is still there, even among \nChristians.\" Still, he says,\u0014\n                      the church needs to get creative in helping \npeople meet other\u0014\n                      Christians, and his site is a step in the right \ndirection.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Kim Hartke says the problem isn't just meeting \npeople but also\u0014\n                      knowing how to conduct yourself once you've met \nthem. Hartke\u0014\n                      was a middle-aged single woman when, as she \nputs it in jogger's\u0014\n                      parlance, she \"hit the wall.\" She was so \ndiscouraged by her lack\u0014\n                      of marital prospects that she verged on \ndepression and was\u0014\n                      worried that she might be losing her faith. She \neven dropped out of\u0014\n                      the children's drama ministry she led.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hartke's story ended happilyshe married at 40, \nand shortly\u0014\n                      thereafter, in 1997, she founded True Love \nMinistries, a parachurch\u0014\n                      organization in the Washington, D.C., area that \nhelps prepare\u0014\n                      single Christians, especially women, for \nmarriage. Hartke, who\u0014\n                      describes herself as an advocate for the older, \nnever-married single\u0014\n                      Christian, believes that most women want to get \nmarried; indeed,\u0014\n                      she believes that most women are called to \nmarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The problem comes, she says, when women take \ntheir dating\u0014\n                      cues from Cosmo and Elle rather than Scripture. \nIn True Love\u0014\n                      Ministries, Hartke undertakes what she calls \n\"feminist\u0014\n                      deprogramming.\" The Bible, she says, is very \nclear that wives are\u0014\n                      to be subject to their husbands. \"You're not \nsubject in a dating\u0014\n                      situation, of course, but allowing the man to \nbe the leader in the\u0014\n                      dating dance is a very good idea; it sets up \nthe pattern for\u0014\n                      marriage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hartke swears by The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets \nfor Capturing\u0014\n                      the Heart of Mr. Right, Ellen Fein and Sherrie \nSchneider's\u0014\n                      controversial and much-maligned 1996 book that \ntells\u0014\n                      womensecular, Bridget Jones-style career \ngalsthat the way to\u0014\n                      hook a man is to let him lead. Scripture, says \nHartke, bolsters\u0014\n                      those rules. \"A lot of church retreat leaders \nsay that it's okay for\u0014\n                      women to ask men outsomething that is directly \ncontradictory to\u0014\n                      Christianity. But because that's part of the \nculture, we've accepted\u0014\n                      it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taking Paul Seriously\u0014\n                      I'm glad Kim Hartke wants to help single \nChristians get married,\u0014\n                      but I'm troubled by her gender politics. I've \nasked men out, and I\u0014\n                      don't see anything in Scripture that suggests \nit's displeasing to\u0014\n                      God. But, more important, I'm troubled by her \nassumption that\u0014\n                      God calls almost all Christians to marriage. \nPaul's comments in 1\u0014\n                      Corinthians 7 are not the most ringing \nendorsement of marriage:\u0014\n                      \"Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It \nis good for them to\u0014\n                      stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot \ncontrol themselves,\u0014\n                      they should marry, for it is better to marry \nthan to burn with\u0014\n                      passion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hartke says that Genesis offers a general call \nto marriage to the\u0014\n                      entire human race, and only \"a very few people \nare called to\u0014\n                      lifelong celibacy.\" For Protestants, she says, \nthe call to celibacy\u0014\n                      is generally a secondary call, subordinated to \na primary call of\u0014\n                      full-time evangelism, missionary work, or other \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      She may take a more extreme stand on this than \nmost, but\u0014\n                      Hartke's contention is not that different from \nwhat most\u0014\n                      evangelicals seem to believe implicitly. Never \nmind how much we\u0014\n                      intone that singleness is great, the general \nattitude is that\u0014\n                      marriage is better. Indeed, as I was working on \nthis article, a good\u0014\n                      friend who works at an evangelical organization \ntold me that he\u0014\n                      thinks people cannot be \"fully mature\" until \nthey marry: \"I know\u0014\n                      that's unpopular and not politically correct,\" \nhe said, \"but that's\u0014\n                      what I think.\" He spoke of the demands that \nmarriage and\u0014\n                      parenting put on him, forcing him to grow up.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      His remarks put voice to what many of us really \nthink: Yes, we\u0014\n                      know Jesus didn't marry. Yes, we know what Paul \nwrote about\u0014\n                      marriage. But, let's face it; marriage makes \nyou grow up more than\u0014\n                      anything that can happen while you're \nunmarried. Sure, you think\u0014\n                      you're growing and developing while single, but \njust wait till you're\u0014\n                      marriedyou ain't seen nothing yet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Evangelicals have made great strides in \naddressing questions of\u0014\n                      singleness in the last generation, but we still \nhave a long way to\u0014\n                      go. We must respond to my friend's comment \nabout the\u0014\n                      superiority of marriage, and not simply because \nsuch remarks\u0014\n                      might hurt single Christians' feelings. We must \ncreatively develop a\u0014\n                      theology of marriage and singleness that \ngrapples honestly with\u0014\n                      the challenging but unambiguous message in the \nNew Testament\u0014\n                      that sometimes marriage, and not singleness, \nmay be the lesser\u0014\n                      of two options. My friend failed to entertain \nthe idea that\u0014\n                      singleness can nurture a type of maturity that \nmarried people will\u0014\n                      never understand. Singleness is sometimes \nlonely, it's sometimes\u0014\n                      difficult, and it does not comport with our \nprepackaged notions of\u0014\n                      family values. But it may well be where God \nwants a lot of us to\u0014\n                      be.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The sad thing is that there is very little \nspace in today's evangelical\u0014\n                      churches for discerning a call to singleness. \nCatholicsat least\u0014\n                      Catholics who believe they are called not just \nto celibacy but also\u0014\n                      to religious ordershave something positive to \ndo. They don't fall\u0014\n                      into a monastery by default. Rather, \nprayerfully and in community,\u0014\n                      they discern God's calling them there. \nProtestants, on the other\u0014\n                      hand, don't often begin imagining they might be \ncalled to\u0014\n                      singleness until their 35th birthday rolls \naround. Then they woefully\u0014\n                      begin to think, Well, maybe I have the gift of \ncelibacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ben Young, whose various singles ministries at \nSecond Baptist of\u0014\n                      Houston typically draw 7,000 people, says that \none of the greatest\u0014\n                      challenges he faces as a singles pastor is, on \nthe one hand,\u0014\n                      helping prepare people who will eventually \nmarry to be in healthy\u0014\n                      relationships while, on the other hand, \n\"affirming that singleness is\u0014\n                      a healthy, legitimate lifestyle.\" He wants to \nmake it clear that\u0014\n                      \"some of you are going to be single for the \nrest of your life, and\u0014\n                      that is greatyou can be fulfilled and never be \nmarried, never have\u0014\n                      sex, never have kids. Singleness may still be \nan evangelical sin,\u0014\n                      but it's not a biblical sin. It's not God's \nwill for everyone to be\u0014\n                      married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Stumbling Into a New Possibility\u0014\n                      I always assumed I was supposed to get married. \nSince I was 15,\u0014\n                      I never went more than a few months without \ndating someone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have begun to wonder, however, if that is \nreally God's plan for my\u0014\n                      life. Not because, at 24, I feel aged out of \nthe dating pool. And not\u0014\n                      because I think being single will leave me with \nmore time to serve\u0014\n                      God. (That argument seems laden with strange \nnotions about\u0014\n                      marriage and singlenessto wit that once you \nmarry you retreat\u0014\n                      into some sort of cocoon from which you never \nemerge, or that a\u0014\n                      single person's daily obligations are not as \npressing or legitimate\u0014\n                      as a married person's.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have begun to wonder if I am called to \nsingleness because God,\u0014\n                      it seems, has been planting new ideas in my \nhead. He has sent\u0014\n                      me stumbling into contact with new, unmarried \npeople, and into\u0014\n                      the clutches of new books with more interesting \nthings to say\u0014\n                      about singleness than the usual jabber.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I haven't drawn any conclusions or sworn off \ndating, but I am\u0014\n                      approaching the issue with more openness than I \nused to. It's not\u0014\n                      that I think I will be a better minister if I \nam single; it's that God\u0014\n                      may be calling me to remember how dependent I \nam on himand\u0014\n                      that no man will ever be an adequate substitute.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It would be lovely if a single person, rather \nthan a\u0014\n                      man-woman-child trinity, lit the Advent candle \nat church; if\u0014\n                      sermons were sprinkled with occasional examples \nabout\u0014\n                      unmarried people; if my Christian friends \nwould, on the whole, treat\u0014\n                      me like an adult even though I'm not married.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But lovelier than all those things would be a \nchurch universal that\u0014\n                      took seriously Paul's apparent preference for \nchastity over\u0014\n                      marriage. And that, I think, is not a task I \ncan lay at the doorstep\u0014\n                      of my married pastor, or my friend who said \ntrue maturity only\u0014\n                      comes with marriage. It is a task that has to \nbegin with me. After\u0014\n                      all, it is I, not they, whom God calledmaybe \nfor a season, and\u0014\n                      maybe foreverto live as a single Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lauren F.

In his previous role as an \nassociate pastor,\u0014\n                      he spent many hours in ministry to singles. CT \nassociate\u0014\n                      editor Edward Gilbreath spoke to him about the \nsexual\u0014\n                      challenges facing single Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What to you are the key trends regarding \nsingles and\u0014\n                      sexual purity?\u0014\n                      In many cases, singles have been redefining \nwhat sex is and\u0014\n                      what's appropriate. What I'm seeing played out \nis a\u0014\n                      depersonalization of human beings through \nsexual behaviors\u0014\n                      and practices. The divine intent is total \nintimacy. It's to know\u0014\n                      as opposed to lie with. \"To lie with\" is an Old \nTestament\u0014\n                      phrase for inappropriate sexual behavior. \nHowever, in the\u0014\n                      Genesis context it's yada\"to know\"a beautiful \nterm for\u0014\n                      complete sharing, not just of bodies but of \nsouls.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What we're seeing more of in relationships \namong Christian\u0014\n                      singlesas well as non-Christians, of courseis \nfalse\u0014\n                      intimacy. There's the offer of what on the \nsurface is real\u0014\n                      intimacy through pornography or oral sex \noutside of\u0014\n                      marriage, but it's short circuiting the real \nthing. It's not total\u0014\n                      body or soul sharing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We live in a culture where our leaders, from \nthe president on\u0014\n                      down, are redefining what sex is. And of \ncourse, in a\u0014\n                      hypersexualized culture, singles understandably \nare\u0014\n                      sometimes quick to latch on to those \nredefinitions. It seems\u0014\n                      to give them new freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In all of this, we're seeing Christian young \npeople, who are\u0014\n                      increasingly depersonalized in their \nrelationships, experience\u0014\n                      less and less true intimacy. This makes the \nChristian\u0014\n                      community and koinonia in the body of Christ \ntake on a new\u0014\n                      level of significance. The church has an \nopportunity in this\u0014\n                      fragmented culture to offer real healing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What counsel can the church offer postcollege\u0014\n                      singles?\u0014\n                      We tend to fragment our sexuality into tiny \nspheres. We need\u0014\n                      to think in terms of the whole, of who we are \nas men and\u0014\n                      women. All of our sexuality belongs to God, all \nof it is healthy,\u0014\n                      and all of it should be developed under the \nlordship of Christ.\u0014\n                      That means so much more than just \"Don't have \nsex outside\u0014\n                      of marriage.\" It's celebrating who you are as a \nman or a\u0014\n                      woman. It's healthy, nonerotic intimate \nrelationships. It's a full\u0014\n                      spectrum of things.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the things we can offer singles is to \nhelp them not\u0014\n                      look at themselves as somehow nonsexual beings, \nbecause\u0014\n                      they're not supposed to be having sex, but to \nlearn to accept\u0014\n                      and celebrate the whole of their maleness and \nfemaleness in\u0014\n                      healthy but nonerotic ways. This doesn't take \naway the\u0014\n                      sexual struggles, but it certainly puts them in \na healthy\u0014\n                      framework.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many Christian singles say that they feel \nchurches\u0014\n                      don't know what to do with them.\u0014\n                      Churches need to reevaluate the subtle attitude \nthat\u0014\n                      suggests that until you're married, you're not \nquite a whole\u0014\n                      person. Churches need to pull singles into the \ninner life of\u0014\n                      the church, into the community and leadership. \nDo we have\u0014\n                      elders and deacons and deaconesses who are \nsingle? If not,\u0014\n                      philosophically what's that saying?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We've given the message that marriage is a \npicture of the\u0014\n                      love relationship between Christ and the \nchurch, and that\u0014\n                      metaphor is true. But as Stan Grenz points out \nin his book\u0014\n                      Sexual Ethics, singles can also mirror Christ's \nlove. In\u0014\n                      marriage, we're to be committed to only one \npersonit's\u0014\n                      exclusive. But there's also an ever-expanding \nsense of God's\u0014\n                      love where he keeps reaching out, establishing \nrelationships\u0014\n                      with more and more people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Singles can demonstrate expanding love by having\u0014\n                      nonexclusive relationships. In not having a \ncovenant\u0014\n                      relationship with a spouse, they can have more \nrelationships,\u0014\n                      which demonstrates a different aspect of the \ncharacter of\u0014\n                      God.\u0014",

Winner | posted 6/4/01\u0014\n                      I sat down in church on a recent Sunday, \nflipped through the\u0014\n                      bulletin, and saw that the readings for the day \nwere about\u0014\n                      marriage: Genesis 2:23-25 and Matthew 19:4-6. I \ngroaned. After a\u0014\n                      still-fresh breakup with a boyfriend, the last \nthing I wanted was to\u0014\n                      sit through another sermon on the joys of \nmatrimony. That sermon\u0014\n                      might apply to the 9 a.m. service, I thought, \nbut here at the 11:45\u0014\n                      service there are lots of single professionals. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To his credit, my pastor tried to make the \nsermon relevant to those\u0014\n                      of us who weren't married. And as I listened, I \nbecame persuaded\u0014\n                      that maybe I had something to learn. After all, \nI'm not a thief, but I\u0014\n                      can usually find something valuable in sermons \nabout stealing. He\u0014\n                      spoke about the responsibility of the community \nto support\u0014\n                      people's marriage vows; I could sign on to \nthat. But then he\u0014\n                      veered: \"This is not only germane to those of \nyou who are\u0014\n                      married,\" he said, \"but also to those of you on \nthe marriage market\u0014\n                      who are looking to be married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He could have stopped there, but instead he \nadded, \"Though,\u0014\n                      frankly, if you're single and Christian and you \nwant to get married,\u0014\n                      you're in the wrong cityunless you're male. \nIt's the same\u0014\n                      demographic story in all the churches in New \nYork City. We have\u0014\n                      many bright, interesting single women and not \ntoo many single\u0014\n                      men.\" He was trying, I think, to be funny. He \nfailed. All the single\u0014\n                      women in my pew cringed. A single man across \nthe aisle smirked.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I know what you're thinking: Another article by \na single Christian\u0014\n                      kvetching about how the church is so \ninsensitivehow her needs\u0014\n                      aren't being met, how she's not being \nrespected. Another single\u0014\n                      Christian demanding to have it both \nways\"Please fix me up with\u0014\n                      your cute nephew, but while you're at it, \nvalidate my singleness,\u0014\n                      and, whatever you do, don't make me feel like \nthere's something\u0014\n                      wrong with me because I'm not married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I hope this isn't another \"beat up on the \nchurch\" session. Not that I\u0014\n                      don't think there are areas in which the church \ncould improve its\u0014\n                      outreach to single adults. Sensitivity to \nsingle people is a problem\u0014\n                      that we should take seriously, if only because \nmany single\u0014\n                      Christians report they've stopped attending \nchurch because of\u0014\n                      jokes like the one my pastor attempted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The church is mostly unaware that there's even \na question to be\u0014\n                      asked,\" says Debra Farrington, author of One \nLike Jesus:\u0014\n                      Conversations on the Single Life (Loyola). \n\"Churches have\u0014\n                      unconsciously bought into the belief that being \nsingle is being\u0014\n                      miserable. They might pat singles' heads and \nsay it's okay, but\u0014\n                      they don't really believe that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For starters, we should give some thought to \nlanguage. Farrington,\u0014\n                      for instance, wonders why we call 20s and 30s \nfellowship groups\u0014\n                      \"pairs and spares.\" Judging by their \nvocabulary, many churches\u0014\n                      make unmarried Christians sound like an \nafterthought. Our words\u0014\n                      matternot only what we say, but what we don't \nsay.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The church doesn't realize how many people \navoid services\u0014\n                      because they are too focused on families and \nalienate singles,\"\u0014\n                      says Lana Trent, the 37-year-old coauthor of \nSingle and Content\u0014\n                      (Word). \"It doesn't take much to throw in an \nexample about\u0014\n                      singles. You can talk about someone's roommate \ninstead of their\u0014\n                      spouse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But sensitivity is not the main question. The \nmain question is, How\u0014\n                      do we think about singleness? Do single \nChristians have special\u0014\n                      needs? And, if so, how does the church go about \nmeeting them?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Redefining Singles Ministry\u0014\n                      When I moved to New York, I visited churches \nfor a year. One of\u0014\n                      the reasons I settled at the church I joined is \nthat it doesn't have a\u0014\n                      singles ministry. No one asked me to serve on \nthe worship team of\u0014\n                      the singles service or teach in the singles \nSunday-school class;\u0014\n                      my pastor instead asked me to serve on the \neducation committee.\u0014\n                      And no one invited me to a singles mixer; \ninstead, I mingle with\u0014\n                      married friends, engaged friends, widowed \nfriends, and other single\u0014\n                      twentysomethings at the church suppers on \nSunday evenings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I didn't want to be part of a singles ministry \nbecause the majority\u0014\n                      of my needs don't have anything to do with \nbeing single. I need\u0014\n                      prayer. I need to serve others. I need to be \nheld accountable for\u0014\n                      my sins. And I figure married people need those \nthings, too. I don't\u0014\n                      want to be segregated with people who, \nsuperficially, are just like\u0014\n                      me. The eye cannot say to the hand, after all, \n\"I don't need you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lots of single Christians don't agree with me. \nIndeed, a lot of my\u0014\n                      Christian friends, who go to different \nchurches, say they chose\u0014\n                      their church precisely because it offers a \nvital singles ministry.\u0014\n                      Singleness, they say, does come with special \nneeds, and thank\u0014\n                      God the church is recognizing that more than it \ndid 20 years ago\u0014\n                      and is responding.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sue Nilson, singles ministry pastor at \nGinghamsburg United\u0014\n                      Methodist Church, a large seeker-sensitive \ncongregation just north\u0014\n                      of Dayton, Ohio, has worked with single \nChristians for almost 15\u0014\n                      years. Good singles ministry isn't a holding \ntank where single\u0014\n                      Christians wallow in those issues, she says; it \nis \"a place to\u0014\n                      process them so that singles can then go on to \nbe great leaders\u0014\n                      for Christ, in the church and the world.\" Those \nissues include\u0014\n                      \"defining success in one's life.\" Sometimes the \nworld defines\u0014\n                      success as marriage, children, and a time-share \nin Florida. Single\u0014\n                      Christians have to think about retooling their \ndreams in a way that\u0014\n                      doesn't leave them \"bitter,\" says Nilson, and \nthe church can,\u0014\n                      should, and in many congregations is helping \nthem do that.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nilson, a single parent of a teenager, has \nbecome popular\u0014\n                      nationally as a seminar and conference speaker. \nShe is not so\u0014\n                      much interested in helping people celebrate \ntheir singleness as\u0014\n                      discovering their gifts. She believes that all \npeople can be a\u0014\n                      \"Michael Jordan\" at something, and it's just a \nmatter of providing\u0014\n                      them a stage for their talents to emerge. \nNilson was hired in 1998\u0014\n                      to start a singles ministry at St. Mark's \nUnited Methodist Church\u0014\n                      in Lincoln, Nebraska. (She recently left there \nto take the\u0014\n                      Ginghamsburg position.) She says the ministry \n\"grew like wildfire\"\u0014\n                      in the 4,000-member church and, within a few \nyears, the singles\u0014\n                      ministry had an outreach to the entire \nsoutheastern region of\u0014\n                      Nebraska.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Eventually the church statistician notified me \nthat our overall\u0014\n                      church membership had become 50 percent single \nadults,\" she\u0014\n                      recalls. \"Singles were chairing the \nadministration board, filling the\u0014\n                      churchwide committees for missions, music, \neducation,\u0014\n                      everythingas well as leading the many facets \nof the single adult\u0014\n                      ministry itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not everyone is as enthusiastic about singles \nministry as Nilson.\u0014\n                      Terry Hershey was once one of the country's \nleading singles\u0014\n                      ministers. In 1981 he joined the staff of \nRobert Schuller's Crystal\u0014\n                      Cathedral in southern California, and he \ncofounded the now defunct\u0014\n                      National Association of Single Adult Leaders. \nHis books and\u0014\n                      seminars established him as an authoritative \nvoice. But in the last\u0014\n                      20 years, he's done some rethinking on the \nsingles issue.\u0014\n                      \"Churches should never be divided along gender \nor marital or\u0014\n                      generational lines,\" he now says. \"As soon as \nwe ghettoize\u0014\n                      peopleOh I'm glad you're in our church today; \nare you single?\u0014\n                      Then go to room 207then we've done something \nwrong. The\u0014\n                      mistake we made 25 years ago, when churches \nwere first getting\u0014\n                      into singles ministry, was to assume that every \nchurch had to have\u0014\n                      a singles minister and a singles program.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hershey now believes churches don't need \nsingles ministers as\u0014\n                      much as singles advocates. And advocacy, he \nsays, \"has nothing\u0014\n                      to do with instituting a program. It has to do \nwith how we help\u0014\n                      provide childcare for single parents who are in \nour church. It has to\u0014\n                      do with how we plug people in who are single \nadults so they know\u0014\n                      they can serve here and have support here. \nThat's singles ministry.\u0014\n                      The churches that are doing that don't have a \nprogramthey don't\u0014\n                      have a class of 200 singles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Missing: A Theology of Sex\u0014\n                      There is one area where single Christians are \nstuck wrestling with\u0014\n                      an issue that is specifically related to their \nsingleness: it's not\u0014\n                      community or ministry; it's sex. While all \nChristians are called to\u0014\n                      chastity, for married folks that means \nforsaking all others besides\u0014\n                      their spouse. For the rest of us, it means \nforsaking sex, period.\u0014\n                      This is tough enough when you're 19 and single. \nIt's an even\u0014\n                      greater challenge if you're still singleor \nsingle againat 32. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As more Christians are single longer and \nlonger, we need to think\u0014\n                      about sex. The issue is not whether we want to \ncave into cultural\u0014\n                      pressures and toss the church's teachings about \nsexual morality\u0014\n                      out the window; instead it's why many single \nChristians do not give\u0014\n                      those teachings the time of day, and what we \ncan do to help\u0014\n                      people live chastely after, say, college. \"It's \ndifficult sexually to\u0014\n                      keep on keeping on as one year stretches into \nfive,\" says Julia\u0014\n                      Duin, 44, assistant national editor of The \nWashington Times and\u0014\n                      author of Purity Makes the Heart Grow Stronger \n(Servant).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Debra Farrington agrees. \"Sex is a complicated \nquestion, and we\u0014\n                      just don't speak about it. There should be an \nopportunity for\u0014\n                      conversation in the church, but the church is \ntoo busy seeing no\u0014\n                      evil and hearing no evil, so singles hang out \nalone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What we need, it seems, are at least three \nthings. First, we need\u0014\n                      venues for frank communication. A single \nChristian ought to be\u0014\n                      able to sit down with her pastor and say, \"My \nboyfriend and I are\u0014\n                      finding it harder to only go as far as kissing, \nand I'm not sure what\u0014\n                      to do about that,\" without fearing that he'll \nnever again take her\u0014\n                      seriously as a committed Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, we should not act like sex outside of \nmarriage is the\u0014\n                      unforgivable sin. A sin, indeed, but one of \nmany that Christians\u0014\n                      struggle with. It is likely that more \nChristians ignore the biblical\u0014\n                      prohibition against gossip than are engaging in \npremarital sex, but\u0014\n                      the church is more exercised about the latter \nissue than the\u0014\n                      former. When we place too much emphasis on one \nsin, we risk\u0014\n                      not only hypocrisy, but we also make it harder \nfor those guilty of\u0014\n                      that sin to come openly to the church for help.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, we need to do more than just point to \na couple of verses in\u0014\n                      Paul's epistles that warn against fornication; \nwe need to present\u0014\n                      single Christians with a whole theology of \nchastity and sexuality.\u0014\n                      \"We lack a sexual theology in the church,\" says \nBen Young,\u0014\n                      coauthor of The Ten Commandments of Dating \n(Thomas Nelson)\u0014\n                      and the singles pastor at Houston's Second \nBaptist Church. Sex\u0014\n                      inside marriage, he says, is a mere shadow of \nthe higher reality of\u0014\n                      oneness in the Trinitybut you don't hear a lot \nabout that on\u0014\n                      Sunday mornings. \"If we want people to give up \npremarital sex,\u0014\n                      we've got to do more than just getting into the \npulpit and saying,\u0014\n                      'No, don't.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Steve Tracy, a professor of theology and ethics \nat Phoenix\u0014\n                      Seminary, has spent years counseling young \nadults on\u0014\n                      relationship issues. He believes the \ndevelopment of a holistic\u0014\n                      \"sexual theology\" is deterred because \nevangelicals tend to\u0014\n                      segregate sexuality into something that only \nmarried people\u0014\n                      should be thinking about. \"We need to think of \nit as the whole of\u0014\n                      what we are as a man or woman,\" Tracy says. \n\"All of it belongs to\u0014\n                      God and should be developed under the lordship \nof Christ.\" He\u0014\n                      adds that the church should not send the tacit \nmessage that\u0014\n                      single people are somehow not sexual beings \nbecause they\u0014\n                      shouldn't be having sex. Instead, he says the \nchurch should\u0014\n                      encourage single Christians to \"celebrate the \nwhole of their\u0014\n                      maleness and femaleness in healthy, nonerotic \nways,\" such as\u0014\n                      spending time in coed fellowship groups where \nsingle people can\u0014\n                      experience the opposite sex in real, \nuncontrived situations. \"It\u0014\n                      won't erase the sexual pressures that they \nface, but it puts things\u0014\n                      in a positive framework.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Building a Better \"Meet Market\"\u0014\n                      When I start railing against singles \nministries, my other unmarried\u0014\n                      friends often look at me like I'm crazy. Not \nonly, they say, do\u0014\n                      singles groups provide them with a sense of \ncommunity with\u0014\n                      others who are wrestling with their unmarried \nstate; the groups\u0014\n                      also provide a place to meet potential dates. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      America's megachurches draw huge numbers not \njust because of\u0014\n                      the laid-back atmosphere and contemporary \nworship; large,\u0014\n                      bustling churches offer single Christians \ngreater opportunities to\u0014\n                      meet other single Christians. Indeed, the \nchurch is doing more\u0014\n                      now than ever before to help Christians find \nsuitable partners,\u0014\n                      which, if you aren't marrying your Christian \ncollege sweetheart,\u0014\n                      can be tough.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most of us single Christians spend the bulk of \nour weeks living and\u0014\n                      working in non-Christian settings. Meeting \nsomeone who is kind,\u0014\n                      intelligent, and charming is difficult enough \n(my non-Christian\u0014\n                      friends complain about the dearth of \ninteresting partners, too); add\u0014\n                      \"Christian\" to the list of requirements, and \nthe pool shrinks even\u0014\n                      more.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The world has changed.

He hasn't met his future wife yet, but \nhe estimates that\u0014\n                      about 200 people have gotten hitched using his \nsite.

Hartke, who\u0014\n                      describes herself as an advocate for the older, \nnever-married single\u0014\n                      Christian, believes that most women want to get \nmarried; indeed,\u0014\n                      she believes that most women are called to \nmarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The problem comes, she says, when women take \ntheir dating\u0014\n                      cues from Cosmo and Elle rather than Scripture. \nIn True Love\u0014\n                      Ministries, Hartke undertakes what she calls \n\"feminist\u0014\n                      deprogramming.\" The Bible, she says, is very \nclear that wives are\u0014\n                      to be subject to their husbands. \"You're not \nsubject in a dating\u0014\n                      situation, of course, but allowing the man to \nbe the leader in the\u0014\n                      dating dance is a very good idea; it sets up \nthe pattern for\u0014\n                      marriage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hartke swears by The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets \nfor Capturing\u0014\n                      the Heart of Mr. Right, Ellen Fein and Sherrie \nSchneider's\u0014\n                      controversial and much-maligned 1996 book that \ntells\u0014\n                      womensecular, Bridget Jones-style career \ngalsthat the way to\u0014\n                      hook a man is to let him lead. Scripture, says \nHartke, bolsters\u0014\n                      those rules. \"A lot of church retreat leaders \nsay that it's okay for\u0014\n                      women to ask men outsomething that is directly \ncontradictory to\u0014\n                      Christianity. But because that's part of the \nculture, we've accepted\u0014\n                      it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taking Paul Seriously\u0014\n                      I'm glad Kim Hartke wants to help single \nChristians get married,\u0014\n                      but I'm troubled by her gender politics. I've \nasked men out, and I\u0014\n                      don't see anything in Scripture that suggests \nit's displeasing to\u0014\n                      God. But, more important, I'm troubled by her \nassumption that\u0014\n                      God calls almost all Christians to marriage. \nPaul's comments in 1\u0014\n                      Corinthians 7 are not the most ringing \nendorsement of marriage:\u0014\n                      \"Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It \nis good for them to\u0014\n                      stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot \ncontrol themselves,\u0014\n                      they should marry, for it is better to marry \nthan to burn with\u0014\n                      passion.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hartke says that Genesis offers a general call \nto marriage to the\u0014\n                      entire human race, and only \"a very few people \nare called to\u0014\n                      lifelong celibacy.\" For Protestants, she says, \nthe call to celibacy\u0014\n                      is generally a secondary call, subordinated to \na primary call of\u0014\n                      full-time evangelism, missionary work, or other \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      She may take a more extreme stand on this than \nmost, but\u0014\n                      Hartke's contention is not that different from \nwhat most\u0014\n                      evangelicals seem to believe implicitly. Never \nmind how much we\u0014\n                      intone that singleness is great, the general \nattitude is that\u0014\n                      marriage is better. Indeed, as I was working on \nthis article, a good\u0014\n                      friend who works at an evangelical organization \ntold me that he\u0014\n                      thinks people cannot be \"fully mature\" until \nthey marry: \"I know\u0014\n                      that's unpopular and not politically correct,\" \nhe said, \"but that's\u0014\n                      what I think.\" He spoke of the demands that \nmarriage and\u0014\n                      parenting put on him, forcing him to grow up.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      His remarks put voice to what many of us really \nthink: Yes, we\u0014\n                      know Jesus didn't marry. Yes, we know what Paul \nwrote about\u0014\n                      marriage. But, let's face it; marriage makes \nyou grow up more than\u0014\n                      anything that can happen while you're \nunmarried. Sure, you think\u0014\n                      you're growing and developing while single, but \njust wait till you're\u0014\n                      marriedyou ain't seen nothing yet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Evangelicals have made great strides in \naddressing questions of\u0014\n                      singleness in the last generation, but we still \nhave a long way to\u0014\n                      go. We must respond to my friend's comment \nabout the\u0014\n                      superiority of marriage, and not simply because \nsuch remarks\u0014\n                      might hurt single Christians' feelings. We must \ncreatively develop a\u0014\n                      theology of marriage and singleness that \ngrapples honestly with\u0014\n                      the challenging but unambiguous message in the \nNew Testament\u0014\n                      that sometimes marriage, and not singleness, \nmay be the lesser\u0014\n                      of two options. My friend failed to entertain \nthe idea that\u0014\n                      singleness can nurture a type of maturity that \nmarried people will\u0014\n                      never understand. Singleness is sometimes \nlonely, it's sometimes\u0014\n                      difficult, and it does not comport with our \nprepackaged notions of\u0014\n                      family values. But it may well be where God \nwants a lot of us to\u0014\n                      be.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The sad thing is that there is very little \nspace in today's evangelical\u0014\n                      churches for discerning a call to singleness. \nCatholicsat least\u0014\n                      Catholics who believe they are called not just \nto celibacy but also\u0014\n                      to religious ordershave something positive to \ndo. They don't fall\u0014\n                      into a monastery by default. Rather, \nprayerfully and in community,\u0014\n                      they discern God's calling them there. \nProtestants, on the other\u0014\n                      hand, don't often begin imagining they might be \ncalled to\u0014\n                      singleness until their 35th birthday rolls \naround. Then they woefully\u0014\n                      begin to think, Well, maybe I have the gift of \ncelibacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ben Young, whose various singles ministries at \nSecond Baptist of\u0014\n                      Houston typically draw 7,000 people, says that \none of the greatest\u0014\n                      challenges he faces as a singles pastor is, on \nthe one hand,\u0014\n                      helping prepare people who will eventually \nmarry to be in healthy\u0014\n                      relationships while, on the other hand, \n\"affirming that singleness is\u0014\n                      a healthy, legitimate lifestyle.\" He wants to \nmake it clear that\u0014\n                      \"some of you are going to be single for the \nrest of your life, and\u0014\n                      that is greatyou can be fulfilled and never be \nmarried, never have\u0014\n                      sex, never have kids. Singleness may still be \nan evangelical sin,\u0014\n                      but it's not a biblical sin. It's not God's \nwill for everyone to be\u0014\n                      married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Stumbling Into a New Possibility\u0014\n                      I always assumed I was supposed to get married. \nSince I was 15,\u0014\n                      I never went more than a few months without \ndating someone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have begun to wonder, however, if that is \nreally God's plan for my\u0014\n                      life. Not because, at 24, I feel aged out of \nthe dating pool. And not\u0014\n                      because I think being single will leave me with \nmore time to serve\u0014\n                      God. (That argument seems laden with strange \nnotions about\u0014\n                      marriage and singlenessto wit that once you \nmarry you retreat\u0014\n                      into some sort of cocoon from which you never \nemerge, or that a\u0014\n                      single person's daily obligations are not as \npressing or legitimate\u0014\n                      as a married person's.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have begun to wonder if I am called to \nsingleness because God,\u0014\n                      it seems, has been planting new ideas in my \nhead. He has sent\u0014\n                      me stumbling into contact with new, unmarried \npeople, and into\u0014\n                      the clutches of new books with more interesting \nthings to say\u0014\n                      about singleness than the usual jabber.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I haven't drawn any conclusions or sworn off \ndating, but I am\u0014\n                      approaching the issue with more openness than I \nused to. It's not\u0014\n                      that I think I will be a better minister if I \nam single; it's that God\u0014\n                      may be calling me to remember how dependent I \nam on himand\u0014\n                      that no man will ever be an adequate substitute.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It would be lovely if a single person, rather \nthan a\u0014\n                      man-woman-child trinity, lit the Advent candle \nat church; if\u0014\n                      sermons were sprinkled with occasional examples \nabout\u0014\n                      unmarried people; if my Christian friends \nwould, on the whole, treat\u0014\n                      me like an adult even though I'm not married.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But lovelier than all those things would be a \nchurch universal that\u0014\n                      took seriously Paul's apparent preference for \nchastity over\u0014\n                      marriage. And that, I think, is not a task I \ncan lay at the doorstep\u0014\n                      of my married pastor, or my friend who said \ntrue maturity only\u0014\n                      comes with marriage. It is a task that has to \nbegin with me. After\u0014\n                      all, it is I, not they, whom God calledmaybe \nfor a season, and\u0014\n                      maybe foreverto live as a single Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lauren F.

Bad clothes. Bad hair. Two \ndecades after the 1970s ended,\u0014\n                      the era of pet rocks and mood rings remains a \nfavored American lampoon. \"I\u0014\n                      ask my students to pick one person they think \nof to represent 'the '60s,' \"\u0014\n                      says Boston University's Bruce Schulman. \"It's \neither Martin Luther King or\u0014\n                      JFK. I ask for one person for the '80s, and \nit's often Reagan. And the '70s?\u0014\n                      It's always John Travolta.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now, though, the joke's on us. A growing \nnumber  of scholars, writers, and\u0014\n                      filmmakers have  dragged this  goofy decade \nout  of the remainder  bin and into the\u0014\n                      ivory-tower boutique. Their conclusion? The \nyears between  the Saturday Night Massacre\u0014\n                      and Saturday Night Fever were hardly the lost  \ndisco weekend of our collective memory.                              \nNo, the '70s are increasingly seen as years of . . . progress and \ninnovation. For better              and worse: Women entered the \nworkforce in huge numbers, the old family \norder                                           collapsed, liberal \neconomic orthodoxy got put on the shelf, and the Christian \nright          began\u0014\n                      to rewrite the script of American politics. \nInstead of a sitcom laugh track, the\u0014\n                      '70s are now seen as a time when the basic \noutlines of much of modern\u0014\n                      American life were hammered into place.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not that anyone actually realized it at the \ntime. When they weren't busy\u0014\n                      pushing their AMC Gremlins to the front of gas \nlines, most folks were\u0014\n                      focused on crises (the fall of Saigon, the rise \nof inflation, the implosion of\u0014\n                      Richard Nixon) that sent the nation's \nself-confidence into free fall. Beneath\u0014\n                      the surface, those same crisesalong with \nsoaring crime and divorce\u0014\n                      rateshelped mold the decades to come. \"From \ncredit cards to cable, and\u0014\n                      from the decline of Keynesian economics and the \nrise of Bill Gates, the\u0014\n                      modernity we take for granted is a product of \nthe '70s situation,\" says\u0014\n                      historian Douglas Brinkley. \"It just always \ntakes a while to notice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fingerprints. These days, we're noticing. Films \nlike 54 and TV movies like\u0014\n                      When Billie Beat Bobby celebrate '70s phenomena \nlike New York's Studio\u0014\n                      54 scene and tennis's \"Battle of the Sexes\" \nbetween Billie Jean King and\u0014\n                      Bobby Riggs as major markers of American \nculture. The past year alone has\u0014\n                      seen major publishing houses issue two \nhistories of the\u0014\n                      decadeSchulman's The Seventies and David \nFrum's How We Got Here.\u0014\n                      The once-dissed decade's greasy fingerprints, \nit seems, are everywhere;\u0014\n                      shaping our politics, our economic policy, our \nvalues, culture, and daily life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Politics. Two major phenomena informed the \npolitics of the 1970sand\u0014\n                      they've never really left us. The first was the \ncombined legacy of Vietnam and\u0014\n                      Watergate: massive disillusionment. Following \nRichard Nixon's resignation\u0014\n                      and pardon, the \"Watergate babies\" who helped \nDemocrats pick up 49 new\u0014\n                      House seats set about reining in what historian \nArthur Schlesinger Jr. called\u0014\n                      \"the imperial presidency.\" They voted for \ncampaign reform, led high-profile\u0014\n                      investigations of the CIA, and expanded \nCongress's reach with an army of\u0014\n                      committees and subcommittees. (Many of the \nfolks running Congress today,\u0014\n                      including Senate Democratic and Republican \nleaders Tom Daschle and\u0014\n                      Trent Lott, as well as House Democratic boss \nDick Gephardt, were first\u0014\n                      elected back then.) Throughout the decade, \nvoter turnout continued a\u0014\n                      post-Watergate tumble. Likewise, the '70s saw \nprivate-sector titans like\u0014\n                      General Motors brought to their \nchrome-and-steel knees, as the gleaming\u0014\n                      new Japanese imports replaced Detroit's \nclunkers on American roads.\u0014\n                      Chrysler was even left to beg, successfully, \nfor a bailout from the nation's\u0014\n                      taxpayers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Washington, revulsion against the Nixon \nlegacy gave us Jimmy Carter, the\u0014\n                      earnest, soft-spoken Georgia governor who \npromised Americans he would\u0014\n                      never lie to them. But the long-term effect of \nthe turn against Washington's\u0014\n                      elite was less comforting to liberals than \nCarter's election: Pols and voters\u0014\n                      alike put plenty of distance between themselves \nand the grand ambitions\u0014\n                      that had characterized the Democratic Party \nthroughout the 20th century.\u0014\n                      Carter was the first Democrat of the century, \nin fact, whose agendaunlike\u0014\n                      FDR's New Deal and LBJ's Great Societywasn't \nknown by a motto that\u0014\n                      embodied muscular ambition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taxes. A second phenomenon of politics in the \n1970s was perhaps even\u0014\n                      more profound. That was the great tax revolt of \n1978. Led by retired California\u0014\n                      businessman Howard Jarvis, Proposition 13 \nofficially targeted the state's\u0014\n                      soaring property taxes. The underlying \nphilosophy found voice across the\u0014\n                      country: Taxes were inherently wrong, and \ngovernment, according to Jarvis,\u0014\n                      was \"evil.\" Jarvis's point of view hasn't \nalways carried the day, but it has\u0014\n                      endured. That same year, Tennessee voters \namended their constitution to\u0014\n                      cap spending; 11 states followed. Since then, \nevery new presidenteven Bill\u0014\n                      Clintonhas promised a stand against taxes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The economy. The '70s may be remembered for \nshuttered factories and\u0014\n                      long gas lines. But during the decade America \nalso crafted two cornerstones\u0014\n                      of economic policy: the determination to avoid \nhigh inflation and to reduce\u0014\n                      reliance on expensive oil. Spurred by the twin \noil shocks of 1973 and 1979,\u0014\n                      inflation soared during the Ford and Carter \npresidencies, topping 11 percent\u0014\n                      by 1979. In other words, if you put your salary \nin a typical savings account,\u0014\n                      you lost money. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      No wonder that as old-fashioned banking became \nbad money management,\u0014\n                      the '70s spawned new pools of investing and \ncredit optionsfrom money\u0014\n                      market accounts to new mutual funds to the \ncredit card market that\u0014\n                      expanded fivefold in the decade after 1973 and \ntoday is ubiquitous.\u0014\n                      Consumer borrowing jumped from $167 billion to \n$315 billion in four years\u0014\n                      as Americans learned to buy today before a \nprice hike and pay tomorrow with\u0014\n                      inflated dollars. \"With double-digit \ninflation,\" says Boston University's\u0014\n                      Schulman, \"thriftiness became just plain dumb.\" \nAt the time, the interest\u0014\n                      rates associated with credit cards were fairly \nclose to inflation. But after\u0014\n                      inflation dropped, those sky-high rates didn't.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      President Ford's \"Whip Inflation Now\" buttons \ndidn't do the trick. Carter's\u0014\n                      ultimate answer, too late to save his \npresidency, was a set of policies that\u0014\n                      slashed the money supply, reined in the budget, \nand hiked interest rates. \"It\u0014\n                      was the end of the 'statist consensus' \" under \nwhich Democratic and\u0014\n                      Republican presidents alike had supported the \nbig spending of the New\u0014\n                      Deal, says Frum. In what came to be known as \nhis \"malaise\" speech, Carter\u0014\n                      lamented that \"all the legislation in the world \ncan't fix what's wrong with\u0014\n                      America.\" The immediate result: a recession \nthat in the second quarter of\u0014\n                      1980 saw the steepest-ever plunge in U.S. gross \nnational product. \"I\u0014\n                      remember it as a very bitter time,\" says Thomas \nGeoghegan, a labor lawyer\u0014\n                      who watched Chicago's steel mills die. The \nlonger-term result: even faster\u0014\n                      progress toward the service economy that \ncharacterized post-'70s America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Values. In 1978, Donahue devoted a show to a \nsubject that today seems\u0014\n                      almost quaint: co-ed dorms. It was a classic \n'70s values debatean example\u0014\n                      of how changes associated with the sexual \nrevolution played themselves out\u0014\n                      in the often mundane world of ordinary life. \nNowhere was the ensuing\u0014\n                      change more pronounced than in the institution \nof marriage. In 1910,\u0014\n                      married couples headed 80 percent of all U.S. \nhouseholds. In 1970, it was\u0014\n                      still 69 percent. After that, it declined \ndramaticallyto about 52 percent in\u0014\n                      2000. The divorce rate per 1,000 population was \n2.5 in 1965, 3.5 in 1970,\u0014\n                      and it didn't fall once during the decade. In \n1972, 84 percent of\u0014\n                      40-somethings were married; a decade later, the \nnumber was 67 percent.\u0014\n                      \"The 1970s were the decade when big medical, \nlegal, technological, social,\u0014\n                      emotional changes were occurring,\" says Martin \nO'Connell, fertility and family\u0014\n                      branch chief at the Census Bureau. \"You started \nseeing a new trend with\u0014\n                      how people viewed marriage. There were changes \nin abortion laws in the\u0014\n                      early '70s. And an introduction of \ncontraceptive technology, the pill, the IUD. . .\u0014\n                      .\" And new no-fault divorce laws made breaking \nup not so hard to do. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Co-ed dorms may now be commonplace, but \nchanging rules about family\u0014\n                      life were emotionally charged back thenand \nstill are. \"We saw an attack on\u0014\n                      marriage, the family, the homemaker, the role \nof motherhood, the whole\u0014\n                      concept of different roles for men and women,\" \nsays Phyllis Schlafly, the\u0014\n                      durable conservative activist who emerged as a \nleader against the equal\u0014\n                      rights amendment, which was introduced in 1972 \nbut never ratified. \"We\u0014\n                      started out calling ourselves the alternative \nto women's lib. But we soon\u0014\n                      became the main story.\" And that was before Roe \nv. Wade, in 1973with the\u0014\n                      exception of race, perhaps, the most emotional \ndivide in contemporary\u0014\n                      America.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Schlafly's counterrevolution has proved far \nmore important than '70s\u0014\n                      attention grabbers like Gloria Steinem's Ms. \nmagazine. The modern\u0014\n                      \"pro-family movement,\" which featured the \nfounding, in 1979, of Jerry\u0014\n                      Falwell's Moral Majority, drove evangelicals in \nrecord numbers into the\u0014\n                      Republican Party, a sea change that would \nresult in the election of Ronald\u0014\n                      Reagan. \"What we did,\" Schlafly says, \"was take \nthese cultural issues and\u0014\n                      bring into the conservative movement people who \nhad been stuck in the\u0014\n                      pews. We taught 'em politics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But that wasn't all. Utah's execution of Gary \nGilmore, in 1977, marked a\u0014\n                      return to the use of capital punishment and \nopened yet another values battle\u0014\n                      over life and death that continues to play out \ntoday. As the values divide of\u0014\n                      last year's election shows, the two '70s-era \nsides in the American culture\u0014\n                      wars are still crossing swords.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Culture. With the exception of blockbuster \nfilms like The Godfather and\u0014\n                      Chinatown, the '70s are most notable for a \nsuccession of fads and fast-buck\u0014\n                      flicks that (luckily for us) are no longer \naround. But what is still around is the\u0014\n                      economic structure that brought those fads to \nthe fore back then. Call it\u0014\n                      niche-market America. In 1969, the Woodstock \nfestival brought a remarkably\u0014\n                      diverse blend of musicblack and white, folky \nand electricto a mass\u0014\n                      audience. Ten years later, though, fans \ndedicated themselves to a wider\u0014\n                      range of musical subsets, from disco to glam to \nSouthern rock. Today, only\u0014\n                      the subsets have changed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Why? You can thank two '70s-inspired trends. \nThe first was the proliferation\u0014\n                      of media outlets. The decade saw the birth of \nNational Public Radio (1970),\u0014\n                      commercial cable TV (1972), and many of the \nso-called alternative\u0014\n                      newspapers. With so many new outlets, there was \nsimply no more reason\u0014\n                      for the entire nation to tune into the same \nshow. \"You see niche marketing\u0014\n                      develop across the world of culture,\" says \nSchulman. \"Then, at the end of the\u0014\n                      decade, cable starts to do the same thing for \ntelevision.\" And thus, for\u0014\n                      reasons that had as much to do with economics \nas cultural malaise, \"by the\u0014\n                      end of the '70s people are defining themselves \nin terms of small-group\u0014\n                      affiliation. The culture latches on to it, and \nstill does to this day.\" Another\u0014\n                      signature product of the decade, the personal \ncomputer, would take this\u0014\n                      trend even further in the decades to come. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While new technologies proliferated, older ones \nsimply became more\u0014\n                      embedded in the culture. TV, in 95 percent of \nU.S. households when the\u0014\n                      decade began, shaped almost everything and \ncreated an expectation that we\u0014\n                      should be able to watch history unfold, \npreferably live. No wonder that\u0014\n                      Saturday Night Live, the decade's most \ninfluential new show, was\u0014\n                      essentially television about . . . television. \nThe show's brand of humor\u0014\n                      remains dominant today. Another reflection of a \nmedia-saturated society: the\u0014\n                      growing cult of celebrity celebration, \nevidenced by the founding, in 1974, of\u0014\n                      People magazine. (Carroll O'Connor, whose death \nlast week prompted\u0014\n                      nationwide mourning, was at the center of lots \nof '70s trends: Archie Bunker\u0014\n                      was the quintessential emblem of resistance to \nsocial change, a\u0014\n                      working-class Irish-American who represented a \nnew awareness of\u0014\n                      ethnicity.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Daily life. Examining the exploding number of \ncults, gurus, and shrinks to\u0014\n                      whom Americans flocked during the '70s, Tom \nWolfe famously dubbed it \"the\u0014\n                      me decade.\" That was in 1976, in an essay in \nNew York magazine. What's\u0014\n                      remarkable is that years after wacky trends \nlike \"primal-scream therapy\"\u0014\n                      faded, so many '70s lifestyle innovations have \nstuck around, from jogging to,\u0014\n                      yes, designer jeans. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Take food, for instance. In 1972, when Gene \nKahn started the New\u0014\n                      Cascadian Survival and Reclamation Project \norganic farm, America's beef\u0014\n                      consumption hit its historic peak. Kahn spent \nthe year producing subpar\u0014\n                      potatoesone batch was so unattractive that the \ndistributor refused to sell\u0014\n                      them. But the concept took root and today \norganic food is a $7.7 billion\u0014\n                      business. A culture of self-obsession naturally \nturned on its own waistline\u0014\n                      and not long afterwards embraced what it \nconsidered good eating.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the spread of organic eats from the commune \nto the strip mall ultimately\u0014\n                      happened for the same reason the decade exerts \nits influence over so many\u0014\n                      other aspects of modern life: Things once \nderided as insurgent, marginal, or\u0014\n                      simply weird were eventually incorporated into \nthe mainstream. If\u0014\n                      consumers changed, so did Kahn. \"I tried to \nsell barley,\" he says. \"Nobody\u0014\n                      eats barley!\" So Kahn learned to farm and sold \nthe organic food people\u0014\n                      actually would buy. Last year, General Mills \nbought the farm. Annual sales\u0014\n                      now approach $100 million. A maverick no more, \nKahn remains an officer of\u0014\n                      the company.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Revisionism. The initial reviews of the '70s \nweren't good. \"A troubled\u0014\n                      decade,\" declared U.S. News as the sands ran \nout on 1979 and 52\u0014\n                      Americans remained hostage in Iran. Early \nhistories bore titles like The\u0014\n                      Seventies: Counterfeit Decade and It Seemed \nLike Nothing Happened.\u0014\n                      \"People dismissed it as shallow,\" says \nhistorian Alan Brinkley. Even today,\u0014\n                      the revisionists who study the '70s don't \nexactly embrace them. \"The way in\u0014\n                      which those times were painful makes it hard \nfor the trickery of nostalgia to\u0014\n                      rework the events into something positive,\" \nsays Frum. While many agree\u0014\n                      that the '70s were years of tremendous \ninfluence, Schulman, a liberal, and\u0014\n                      Frum, a conservative who now works as a White \nHouse speechwriter, view\u0014\n                      its legacy in oppositeif equally \nhostileterms. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course, if the decade that gave us I'm \nOKYou're OK taught us anything,\u0014\n                      it's that both sides can be right. America \ntoday is shaped equally by the turn\u0014\n                      toward new social freedoms that liberals adore \nand the turn away from\u0014\n                      state-dominated economics that conservatives \nadmire. In fact, the two\u0014\n                      phenomena depend on one another. Without the \n'70s' culture of irreverence\u0014\n                      toward hierarchy, we wouldn't have the \ncasual-Friday capitalism of our\u0014\n                      high-tech present. And without the decade's \npolitical turn away from the\u0014\n                      egalitarian political values of the New Deal, \nwe couldn't have made room for\u0014\n                      the vast menu of lifestyle options we now know.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Twenty years after the '70s ended, its dominant \nsocial trends, locked\u0014\n                      together in an uncomfortable but enduring \nembrace, still define the way we\u0014\n                      live our lives. \"The questions that \ncontemporary America raises for us as\u0014\n                      interpreters of politics and culture end up \nalways sending us back to the\u0014\n                      '70s, and not the '60s, to find out how we got \nhere,\" says Schulman.

    "words": "SEXUAL STAGES OF \nMAN'S LIFE\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                         \nJACK BALSWICK\u0014\n\u0014\nSince there is no exisiting model describing the sexual stages of a \nman's life, this article brings together insights from several \ndifferent souroces. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore proceeding, it should be noted that I am using a stage model \nmore as an organizing than a developmental frame- work. Developmental \ntheorists such as Erikson argue for critical periods, a concept that \nrefers to a fixed time period in human development during which \ncertain behaviors opti- mally emerge. Therefore, while accepting the \nidea that there are approximate periods during which developmental \ntasks become central, oscillation theory seems better suited for \ndescribing sexual stages of men's life. Oscillation theory suggests \nthat \"transitions occur not as step functions, where  discontinuous \nleaps are made from one level of functioning to another, but rather \nthrough an oscillation between levels of functioning! The focus is on \nthe competence shown by an individual in mastering a given \ndevelopmental task.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happens at one stage of sexual development influences and \nimpacts the cumulative effects of what happens at subsequent stages. \nThus, while the primary focus in this arti- cle is on adult male \nsexuality, it is necessary to understand the developing sexuality of \nmales during their early years. Although the concept of stage \ndevelopment can help us understand regular patterns of male sexual \ndevelopment and behavior, oscillation theory discourages one from \napplying stage concepts too rigidly. Men enter and exit from \ndevelopmental stages at different ages. Some men move from one stage \nto another so smoothly that it doesn't make sense to speak of \nseparate lifecycle stages. Other men linger or seem to get stuck in a \ngiven stage, unable to move on. There are those who experience a \nmajor crisis during an early transition but make the later \ntransitions relatively easy. Some seem to avoid any transitional \nstruggle at all. While attempting to identify the major sexual issues \nand patterns that many men experience at each developmental stage, it \nshould not be assumed that all men pass through the stages in \nlock-step unIson.\u0014\n\u0014\nRelational Sex: Men's Major Develapmental Task\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key premise for this article is that the major developmental task \nfacing men is integrating sexuality within a relational context. In \nthe book Men and Sex:New Psychological Perspectives, Levant\u0014\nand Brooks suggest that what most distinguishes male from female \nsexuality, and what men most struggle with is nonrelational \nsexuality. Nonrelational sexuality is \"the tendency to experience\u0014\nsex primarily as lust without any requirements for relational \nintimacy or emotional attachment.\"3 The thesis that men more than \nwomen struggle with integrating sexuality within personal \nrelatedness, is consistent with social science research indicating \ndifferences between male and female sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are the two major explanations of the origin of male \nnonrelational sexuality. Evolutionary psychologists and \nsociobiologists argue that, due to natural selection, males are \nphysiologically programmed for nonre- lational sexuality.4 \nAlternatively, social constructionists argue that nonrelational \nsexuality is a reflection of how male sexuality is culturally defined \nwithin traditional gender ideology.5 A biblical basis for \nunderstanding nonrelational sexuality in men can be seen in the \nGenesis account of Adam and Eve of the Fall. For this discussion I \nrely heavily on the work of Gilbert Bilezikian and Mary Stewart Van \nLeeuwen.6\u0014\n\u0014\nGenesis 3:6 indicates that whereas Adam and Eve both disobeyed God \nwhen eating the forbidden fruit, each of them sinned in a distinctive \nway. For her part, Eve went beyond God's command and transgressed \nGod's dominion. Adam sinned by participating with Eve and equally \ndisobeyed God's command. God's morality called for Adam to remain \nseparate from his wife and to not participate with her in the sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy choosing a relationship with Eve over God, Adam violated the \nbounds of relationship accountability. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsequences of Eve and Adam's sin were expulsion from the garden, \nstruggle and pain in childbirth, difficulty in rais- ing children and \nmaking a living, and eventual death. However, there were also \npersonal and relational consequences of their particular sins. For \noverstepping God's boundary of dominion, Eve's punishment was to be \ndominated, i.e., \"Your desire will be for your husband, and he will \nrule over you\" (3: 16). For overstepping God's boundary of listening \nto Eve rather than God, Adam would blame her and seek to dominate her \nrather than be in a rightful mutual relationship with her. The curse \nfor Adam was that his decision to dominate would thwart closeness and \nintimacy with his mate. As more a result of sin, then, there would be \na propensity in males to dominate making it difficult to achieve a  \npersonal-centered intimate connection in relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis difficulty can be recognized in nonrelational sexuality. Men \nmore than ,ality women struggle with integrating their.sexuality into \na personal relational context. Examples of nonrelational sexuality \ninclude such things as fantasizing about tantalizing sexual \nexperiences when making love to one's spouse, the inability to \nexperience a deep human emotional connection outside of sexual \nexpression, or focusing on features of a woman's body rather than her \nperson. More serious forms of nonrelational sexuality include \nrepetitive infidelity, compulsive womanizing, obsession with \npornography, phone/computer/compact-disc sex, strip shows, \n\"gentlemen's clubs,\" prostitution, sexual addictions, sexual \nharassment, rape, and child molestation.7\u0014\n\u0014\nChildhood\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough a nonrelational orientation to sexuality may be rooted in \nthe Fall, it is a condition which is reinforced by sociocultural \nstructures encountered by males throughout the developmental process. \nMales are socialized to be tough, competitive, self-reliant and \nemotionally stoic. These expectations soon become self-fulfilling \nprophecy. In early childhood boys begin to internalize an image of \nmasculine behavior such as boisterous humor, athletic enthusiasm, \nphys- ical and verbal aggression. Boys learn to reject and avoid \n\"feminine\" traits like tenderness, compassion, sentimentality, \ngentleness, verbal affection, and soft-heartedness. Needless to say, \nearly-acquired gender traits will be perpetuated as masculine sexual \nbehavior in later development.\u0014\nDuring Erikson's trust versus mistrust stage, depravation of a secure \nand loving environment will, no doubt, make it difficult to trust or \ngive love to others. Such an early deficiency would constrict one's \nability to integrate sex and love in adult relationships. During the \nautonomy versus shame stage, a balance between connnectedness and \nseparateness is crucial. The amount of control or tolerance shown \nduring this stage can contribute to the ability for a boy to develop \na separate self that can, in fact, make deep relational connection.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the initiative versus guilt stage, children take on \nresponsibility for specific tasks which are commonly gender- \nstereotyped activity. Parents tend to encourage physically oriented \ntasks for boys and internal mechanisms for males to be tough-natured \nrather than nurturing. In a like manner, during the industry versus \ninferiority stage, boys develop greater mastery in the external world \nof objects and things, while girls pay more attention to \ninterpersonal relationships. Boys are encouraged in physical prowess, \nmaking it more difficult for them to know how to engage emotionally \nwith others.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdolescence\u0014\n\u0014\nAdolescence is the stage of sexual awakening. This is a time when \npopular culture disseminates messages about male sexuality through \nthe media. A composite picture of masculine sexuality includes \nqualities like physical strength, sexual potency, aggression, and \ndominance.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile adolescent boys are working through identity issues, females at \nthis age are primarily focused on relational inti- macy. Boys develop \na sense of identity and self-worth based on their status within an \nidentifiable peer group. Achieving status within the peer group is a \ncompetitive process whereby males establish themselves in a \"pecking\" \norder. High ranking is given to hegemonic or \"alpha\" males, which \ninclude the sexually desirable characteristics such as physical \nstrength, athletic capacity, and success in attracting girls. \nAdolescent males are so preoccupied with finding their \"male\" \nidentity that they give little energy, nor are they encouraged, to \ndevelop intimacy skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen an adequate masculine identity fails to take root, the self \nconsists of a confused mixture of sexually defined qualities. Due to \nthe lack of emotional and relationship skill development among \nadolescent males, their sexual encoun- ters tend to be primarily \nphysical and void of emotional connection. For example, boys are more \nlikely to coerce gitls into having sex, while gitls expect commitment \nand invest- ment in the relationship to be the basis for having sex.8 \nThe greater the identity diffusion and relational isolation, the \ngreater the likelihood that depersonalized sexual exploitation and \npromiscuity characterize an adolescent male's sexual encounters. \nSignificantly, Tubman, Windle and Windle found that adolescent boys \nwere twice as likelyas adolescent girls to have sex with multiple \npartners.9 In a study of 13- to 16-year-old boys, Udry found \ntestosterone levels to be related to the sexual activities of coitus \nand masturbation, and feeling sexually \"turned on.\"lO But, he also \nfound that the decision to participate in sexual activities was \naffected by sociological factors such as living in an intact home, \nparent's educational level, and church attendance.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung Adulthood\u0014\n\u0014\nThe male who emerges from adolescence with a coherent, integrated \nsense of self is prepared to develop intimacy skills. Such men are \nprepared to make long-term commitments in their relationships. Even \nin committed relationships, how- ever, men are not immune from \nintimacy struggles. Young women base relational intimacy on verbal \ncommunication and emotional sharing, while young men are likely to \nfeel intimate when theyare simply doing activities with that per- \nson. Perhaps the inadequacy felt about sharing at a more personal \nlevel keeps them from developing skills in this area.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fear of commitment in relationships and/or the inabil- ity to be \nemotionally intimate and vulnerable can keep men at a \nnonrelationallevel. They flee from serious relationships because they \ndoubt that they have the capacity to sustain long-term committed \nrelationships. Intimacy with women can also be hampered by the male's \ntendency to sexualize friendships. Males with underdeveloped intimacy \nskills will tend to equate sexual involvement with intimacy. \nLevinson's model suggests that a low level of identity integration \nand a low level of intimacy skills can result in young men becoming \n\"stuck\" in adolescent type sexual encounters. Characteristics of \nthese men include a preoccupation with body rather than \nperson-centered sex, searching for personal masculine ade- quacy \nthrough sexual conquests, an inability to move beyond shallow \nrelationships, or make ttusting long-term commitments.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is no accident that men's magazines such as Playboy are aimed at \nyoung men in their 20s. Playboy teaches young men how to be \nresourceful and shrewd so they can interact with women with a certain \ndetachment by \"playing it cool.\" The playboy tteats women as a \ncommodity to be consumed. The playboy's relationship with women \nrepresents the culmina- tion of the marketing-oriented personality in \nwhich a person learns to manipulate and exploit. Sexuality is reduced \nto a packageable item that can be handled with no demands placed on \nthe man. The woman is reduced to a playmate or playboy accessory. A \nsuccessful affair is one in which the bed is shared, but the man \nemerges free of any personal involvement or investment. When playtime \nis over, she easily can be dis- carded. The playboy is a skilled \nmanipulator of women, knowing when to turn the lights down, what \nmusic to play on the stereo, which drinks to serve, and what topics \nof conver- sation to pursue. The playboy is not suppose to lose his \nheart to the woman, so he remains above it all by not relating to her \nas a person. She is a nonrelational sex object with whom he never \nshares his emotions or heart.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMiddle Adulthood\u0014\n\u0014\nErikson described the developmental challenge of middle adulthood \n(around ages 30-45) as the conflict of generativ- ity versus \nstagnation. Generativity is having a concern for the future of \nhumankind, which can be seen in men who invest themselves in other \npeople. A truly generative man looks beyond his own personal ambition \nor gratification and establishes connections with the well being of \nothers in mind. Men who fail to resolve generativity are stagnated, \nlacking any deep connection or relatedness with others. Their sexual \nlives tend to be characterized by self-focused sexual activities and \nnonrelational sex that lacks emotional involvement. Some men at this \nstage think it is their \"last chance to play the field,\" so they \ncontinually search for the ideal sexual encounter. Although they \nrationalize that they are \"keeping their options open,\" in reality, \nthey are unable to make a solid emotional connection. This also \ninterferes with the set- cling-down life stage.\u0014\n\u0014\nMen who are able to commit to a person-centered rela- tionship will \nfind the transitions at midlife deepen their capacity to be effective \nand generative in their significant rela- tionships. T ypically, men \nin middle adulthood are living busy lives. The demands emanating from \nmeeting expectations at work, creating a secure financial situation, \nand home and family responsibilities may drain energy away from the \nmar- ital relationship. Research indicates that a major sexual issue \nfor men during the settling down period centers on keeping sexual \nintimacy alive. Silny reports that middle-aged men are still highly \nresponsive to sexual stimuli but less preoccupied with sexual \nthoughts and fantasies.))\u0014\n\u0014\nMany men in midlife transition experience a midlife cri- sis. This is \nthe \"big one,\" the 8 points or a higher shake-up on the Richter \nrelationship scale. A number of work-related factors can affect a \nman's self confidence-fear of being over- taken in one's work by a \nyounger person, not being \"on time\" in the scheme oflife, realization \nthat one will not reach occu- pation goals, workaholic tendencies, \nand career burnout. Levinson points out four polarities which men may \nfeel about their masculinity and sexuality during this mid-life \nperiod.)2\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, men in midlife can feel disturbed because of the young/old \npolarity. Men at midlife begin to question if they are still as \nsexually potent or sexually attractive as when they were young. In an \nattempt to appear younger, they dye their gray hair, dress in sporty \nstyles, go on rigorous weight-lifting routines, or buy flashy cars. \n..all this to be found more physically attractive to women and \nenhance their egos.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second polarity is destruction/ creation. Having experienced \nconflict and hurt on the job or in close relationships, midlife men \nmay be tempted to resort to destructive tactics. Aware of heart \nattacks, prostate surgery, and deaths of friends their age, they may \nfear physical problems and how such dif- ficulties may impact their \nsex lives. Although illness can adversely affect an older male's \nsexual performance, according to Levy, \"Sexual problems, including \nmale impotency follow- ing a heart attack are common and usually stem \nfrom psychosocial anxiety and apprehension rather than organic \ncauses\"13 It's important that men discover creative ways to express \ntheir sexuality to prove they are not beyond their pro- ductive and \npassionate years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe masculinity/femininity polarity points to middle aged men who \nattempt to sustain a manly appearance of strength and toughness but \nat the same time are more open to the sensitive, nurturing, and \nemotionally expressive side. While their masculine side pushes them \nto further achievement and ambition, their feminine side calls them \nto be more relational and responsive to the needs of others. Men who \nare insecure about their masculinity will have difficulty allowing \ntheir fem- inine side to emerge and may resort to a \nhyper-masculinity. Those who are able to get in touch with and \nembrace their sensitive side can develop a richer, deeper capacity \nfor a fuller sexual involvement. In his book, The Passionate \nMarriage, Schnarch argues that person-to-person intimate sex is only \npossible for the \"blessed few.\"14Those mature adults who are clearly \ndifferentiated, who stand on their own from a solid place of identity \nand self validation, have the deepest capacity to truly experience \nintimacy in their sexual relationships. The \"one flesh\" notion in \nGenesis provides a similar picture of \"unity\" that is possible \nbetween two individuals who give and receive in mutually satisfying \nways. The Song of Solomon shows the engagement of two lovers who \nexpress their desire for each other in sexual and relational terms.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the attachment/separateness polarity points to the need for \nbalance between connection and self-sufficiency. Men who find this \nbalance are capable of deeper emotional attachments because they are \nnot afraid of being consumed by the other. Men who fail to work \nthrough attachment and separation issues tend to get themselves in \nsexually enmeshed relationships at one extreme or defensively \ndetached relationships at the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nMature Adulthood\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Erikson, the primary developmental task of matUre \nadulthood is ego integration, bringing the various parts of one's \nlife structure into a consistent and integrated whole. Men with high \nego integration live with a confidence that their lives have meaning. \nWith such men sexuality is well integrated into their total being. \nMen who lack the needed inner resources, per- haps because of a \nseries of failures, experience \"ego despair.\" Being lonely and not \nhaving the capacity to establish a meaningful car- ing relationship \nwith another person can be part of that despair.\u0014\nA false cure for men in despair can be \"sexual excitement\" that is \nsought through a variety of nonrelational means, such as extramarital \naffairs or consumption of pornography. The desire for sexual \nexcitement is not wrong, but the means of finding it is. The danger \nfor men in ego despair is\u0014\nto \"externalize\" their problems, to see the despair as emanating from \noutside rather than from within. Personal inadequacy may be projected \nupon a spouse. For instance, a man might blame his lack of\u0014\nsexual enthusiasm on his wife, not realizing that he gives little in \nthe way of emotional expressiveness and care that would encourage her \ntoward sexual intimacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nA significant number of men experience psychological and social \ndifficulties during their later stages of life. Some of this, such as \nhaving a less potent erection or ejaculation, may be related to hor-\u0014\nmonal decline. Decline in testosterone due to aging means that a man \nrequires firm, more direct, and longer stimulation to produce and \nsustain an erection. Although testosterone decline can espe-\u0014\ncially be pronounced toward the end of mature adulthood, it is not \nnecessarily associated with decreased desire or sexual \nsatisfaction.15 Knowing how to adjust their sexual involvement as a \ncouple gets older can go a long way in insuring continued sexual \nsatisfaction for both spouses. Mitz and Miner believe that most \nsexual difficulties experienced by couples in their 60s stem from \ncultural and lifestyle changes rather than hormonal changes.16\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLate Adulthood\u0014\n\u0014\nTransition into late adulthood begins for most men at around age 60 \nand continues on to retirement, usually around age 65. In this \ntransition, men finish the efforts of middle life stages and prepare \nfor late manhood. Aging involves physical changes, declining \ncapabilities, and psychological change. The degree of life \nsatisfaction men enjoy during this period varies from man to man. \nCircumstances like loss of significant work role, lack of life \nmeaning, and poor health for self or spouse can also serve as \nbarriers to enjoyment of latter life. Laumann, Gagnon, \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael, and Michaels found that no other factor affects men's \nfrequency of total sexual outlet as much as age.17 In their exten- \nsive research, Masters and Johnson reported that older men require \nmore direct stimulation to achieve an erection, ejacula- tion becomes \nless forceful, and the penis becomes flaccid more quickly following \nejaculation.1B While the downward curve toward decreased sexual \nactivity is a physical reality, it does not mean that sexuality \ncannot continue to be a vital aspect of a man's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn later life stages, a positive self-concept is important for \nmaintaining a satisfying sexual relationship. Levy writes, \n\"Women...are more likely to construct their self-images primarily \nbased on judgments about their appearance; men also consider \nappearance but give greater\u0014\nMature adults weight to sexual performance.\"19 Fear of performance \nadequacy may be the great-\u0014\nwho are clearly est barrier to sexual performance among older men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her summary of relevant literature Levy writes, \"evidence suggests \nthat most older people find sex equally as satisfying or more so than \nwhen they were .younger, particularly when the social rewards of sex \nare considered.\"2 .Increased androgyny among older men may mean that \nthelr greater sensitivity and capacity for intimacy yields greater \nenjoyment for all aspects of sexual lovemaking such as kissing, \ncuddling, hugging, holding, and stroking.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this summary, generalizations about sexual stages of a man's life \nneed to be given with several pre- cautions in mind. First, the \nresearch showing differences in sexual activity by age is \ncrosssectional rather than cohort data. Ideally, the sexual behavior \nof a cohort of men would be fol- lowed throughout their lifecycles, \nthus assuring that the changes reported are the result of aging, \nrather than explained by dif- ferences between cohorts of men exposed \nto different historical periods. Men who are elderly, for instance, \nwere socialized into adulthood when sexual norms were more \nconservative than for males entering young adulthood today. In the \nChicago research, younger cohorts indicate they are sexually active \nearlier, have more partners, and have their first sexual experience \noutside of marriage earlier than adults who were in their SOs at the \ntime of the research!1\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, although it is easier to demonstrate quantitative age \ndifferences about sexual behavior, qualitative rather than \nquantitative differences may be more meaningful. Since the norms for \nfrequency of sexual intercourse are set for young men, when older men \nparticipate less frequently in sex, they are perceived as \n\"diminishing\" sexually. Research consistently shows that desire for \nand frequency of coitus declines as men age. However, such evidence \nfocuses only on the quantity and not the quality of sex- ual \nengagement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird; individual change in sexuality over the lifespan is best \nunderstood as an interaction between physiolog- ical and \npsychosociocultural factors. Physiological changes do affect a man's \nsexuality directly and indi- rectly, but psychosociocultural \nattitudes have a powerful impact on physiological factors as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, while it is possible to point to normative differences \nbetween men at different stages of life, there is great individual \nvariation between men within each stage, as well as differences in \nthe timing for entering and existing stages.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, the degree ofsexual adequacy and health exhib- ited at an \nearly developmental stage has an influence on the degree of sexual \nadequacy and health at the following stages. The formation of male \nsexuality is best under- stood as cumulative, so that healthy and \nadequate sexual formation at one stage is accumulative over the \nlifespan. Inversely, sexual inadequacy at one stage, if not \ncorrected, has a cumulative negative impact in later stages.\u0014\n\u0014\nSixth, the major task for Christian counselors dealing with males \nthroughout the lifecycle is to assist them in developing a greater \ncapacity for relational and emo- tional skills. Although \nnonrelational sex may be an enduring issue for men, it needs to be \nunderstood within a lifecyde context. The redemption of male sex- \nuality centers on empowering men to express their sexuality in the \ncontext of an emotionally involved, per- son-centered, committed \nrelationship.\u0014\n-----------------\u0014\n\u0014\nJack Balswick, Ph.D., is currently Professor of Sociology and Family \nDevelopment at Fuller School of psycho~ Pasadena, California.

If something can be done, then it will be, and no one \ncan put the genie back in the bottle. Once a discovery has been made, \nit cannot be un-discovered.\u0014\n                  So the current debate about embryonic stem-cell \nresearch - full of sound and fury - signifies nothing. The U.S. could \npass a law banning all such research, but doing so would not stop \nresearch in other countries.\u0014\n                  The cells' usefulness suggests the cures they seem \nto promise eventually will arrive, and political pressure would soon \nlead to a repeal of the ban.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Still, the discussion is fun to watch. Liberals are \nleaping over one another trying to beat the conservatives who oppose \nstem-cell research over the head with the issue. They gleefully point \nto the split on the right, portraying the anti-research faction as \ntechnological troglodytes and gloating that pro-research pro-lifers \nhave discovered not every question is one-dimensional. (When the left \nopposes scientific advancement in areas such as genetically modified \ncrops, it receives more respectful criticism.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The debate also reveals the impoverished quality of \ndiscourse. Bioethicist Bonnie Steinbock of the University of Alabama, \nfor instance, wonders why \"discarding embryos is fine, keeping them \nin the freezer in perpetuity is fine, the only thing that is not fine \nis using them for medical research.\" Any Ethics 101 student could \ntell her many philosophers and theologians believe morality requires \ntreating other human beings as ends in themselves, not as mere means \nto an end. If one accepts the humanity of the fertilized egg, then \nusing it in experiments is just as wrong as experimenting on small \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The merits of stem-cell research appear obvious. \nUnless one takes the most extreme position - a position requiring the \noverturning of Roe v. Wade and the prohibition of all abortions \neverywhere - the question seems cut-and-dried. The President should \ncease dawdling and declare his administration in favor of stem-cell \nresearch. Nothing but good can come of doing so.\u0014",

Nonetheless, he said he \nconsiders\u0014\n                         their recovery remarkable. \u0014\n                                Their hind limbs went from being \ncompletely flaccid and\u0014\n                         dragging to having some muscle movement, he \nsaid. Gradual\u0014\n                         improvement continued:\u0014\n\u0014\n                         They started to draw in their limbs, then \nthey could\u0014\n                         support some weight. Eventually gait was \nrestored,\u0014\n                         though it was twitchy. But they are \nambulatory.\u0014\n                                While the scientists still arent \ncompletely sure why\u0014\n                         gait was restored, Gearhart said there is \nevidence of at\u0014\n                         least two mechanisms at work. First, the \nprogrammed\u0014\n                         human stem cells mature into human motor \nneurons that\u0014\n                         stepped in and replaced the damaged neural \ncells in the\u0014\n                         rats and mice, he said. In addition, he \nsaid, they secreted\u0014\n                         a substance known as a growth factor that \ncaused the\u0014\n                         animals own motor neurons to regenerate.\u0014\n                                Gearhart stressed that the technique \nwas used in\u0014\n                         animals with paralysis due to motor neuron \nloss; they still\u0014\n                         had intact spinal cords. This is not the \nsame as paralysis\u0014\n                         due to spinal cord injury, such as that \nsuffered by actor\u0014\n                         Christopher Reeve, so this technique may not \nbe\u0014\n                         applicable to such injuries.\u0014\n                                The research, which was funded by \nProject ALS, a\u0014\n                         New York-based nonprofit organization, has \nbeen\u0014\n                         submitted to a major journal for publication.\u0014\n  \u0014\n                          QUESTIONS REMAIN\u0014\n                                Gearhart has already started testing \nthe technique\u0014\n                         on monkeys. But, he and others said, many \nquestions\u0014\n                         remain to be answered before human tests can \nstart. \u0014\n                                Davor Solter of Germany, a pioneer in \nthe field,\u0014\n                         expressed concern that the technique could \ncause\u0014\n                         tumors to form months, even years, down the \nline.\u0014\n                         Whenever one induces cell proliferation  a\u0014\n                         characteristic of cancerous cells  that is \na worry,\u0014\n                         explained Johns Hopkins Dr. David Valle, \nwho was not\u0014\n                         involved with the new work.\u0014\n                                Gearhart downplayed the risk, \nexplaining that his lab\u0014\n                         had developed a fail-safe system for \nknocking out\u0014\n                         cancerous cells in which any cell that \nproduces a certain\u0014\n                         end product is destroyed. Before \ninstituting the system,\u0014\n                         two animals in the lab developed tumors, he \nsaid. Since\u0014\n                         then, weve had none.\u0014\n                                Solter pointed to other unanswered \nquestions: How\u0014\n                         many stem cells are needed for a therapeutic \neffect? Is\u0014\n                         using your own stem cells crucial? Does it \nneed to be\u0014\n                         done right after injury, when these animals \nwere treated?\u0014\n                                Also, the animals were given \nimmunosuppressive\u0014\n                         drugs before the transplant so they wouldnt \nreject the\u0014\n                         human stem cells as foreign bodies. While \nGearhart said\u0014\n                         theres no evidence that the drugs affected \nthe results in\u0014\n                         any way, it remains to be seen what would \nhappen if the\u0014\n                         drugs are not given, Solter said.\u0014\n                                Despite all the questions, the work \nis very exciting,\u0014\n                         said Valle, a co-director of the meeting. If \nthe early work\u0014\n                         pans out, human stem cell transplantation \nholds the\u0014\n                         potential to help people whom medicine up \nto now has\u0014\n                         failed to help.\u0014",

    "words": "Storing What We Do \nNot Need\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus did not condemn the man for eating, drinking and being merry, \nnor even\u0014\nfor being rich. Rather the man was called foolish for building bigger \nbarns.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point of the story is that the entrepreneur was planning to store \nmore\u0014\nof his wealth than he needed to eat, drink and be merry. Look again \nat the\u0014\nwords of the story. The man says, \"What shall I do for I have nowhere \nto\u0014\nstore my crops?\" Not true! He has barns. His problem is that his \nharvest has\u0014\nbeen so great that his present storage facilities will not hold all \nof the\u0014\ngrain. So he decides, \"I will tear down my barns and build larger \nones, and\u0014\nthere I will store all my grain. Then and only then will I have ample \ngoods\u0014\nto eat, drink and be merry.\" Again, not true! He already has ample \ngoods. He\u0014\ndoes not have to live in the moment. He has barns for his future. \nThey may\u0014\nnot be as big as he would like, but he has plenty to eat, drink and \nbe merry. The man already has enough wealth to enjoy Shalom. He has a \nsense of well-being and security because God has generously blessed \nhis land withfruitfulness. Fortune has smiled on him and he has been \nable to accumulate a sizeable portion of this world's goods.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point of the story is not that there is something wrong with \namassing\u0014\nsome wealth, but that he was intending to store it all by building \nbigger\u0014\nbarns and storing it. He was called \"foolish\" because he did not \nrecognize\u0014\nthat his wealth had brought him happiness and that it could do the \nsame for\u0014\nothers if only it were not locked up in those bigger barns. His sin \nwas not\u0014\nthat he had become wealthy, but that he wanted to hoard all his \nwealth. His\u0014\nsin was not that he ate, drank and was merry, but that he was \nwithholding\u0014\nthe means for others to do the same. He had become a bottleneck in \nthe flow\u0014\nof Shalom blessings to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story, so understood, is not a teaching condemning the \nfoolishness of\u0014\ngathering wealth. It is rather a parable which condemns the refusal \nto share\u0014\nthe wealth we do not need. It warns about the shortsightedness of \nfailing to\u0014\nbe a good custodian of the abundance that God entrusts to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nW.

But in \nmatters of litigation,\u0014\n                      there are rarely any simple answers. There may \nbe situations where\u0014\n                      one is legally justified in filing a lawsuit, \nbut a Christian must evaluate\u0014\n                      more than just the letter of the law. To \nunderstand what is at stake, it\u0014\n                      is helpful to consider what God's Word says \nabout Christians suing\u0014\n                      Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, Paul reprimands church \nmembers who have\u0014\n                      filed lawsuits against each other. Their \npettiness, suggests the\u0014\n                      apostle, lacks eternal foresight and discredits \nthe testimony of the\u0014\n                      church. In Matthew 18:15-20, Jesus offers \nprinciples for how two\u0014\n                      believers are to resolve a conflict. And \nearlier on, Jesus advised his\u0014\n                      followers about how to carry themselves if they \nare the object of a\u0014\n                      suit: \"If someone wants to sue you and take \nyour tunic, let him have\u0014\n                      your cloak as well\" (Matt. 5:40, NIV). What \ndoes this mean for us in\u0014\n                      today's ultra-litigious society?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Christ's followers, we are called to live in \nunity. God wants us to\u0014\n                      be at peace with one another (Rom. 12:18). A \nsuing Christian is\u0014\n                      usually enticed to take on the adversarial \nspirit manifested in the\u0014\n                      legal system. The predacious nature of our \nculture, the retention of\u0014\n                      attorneys, and the courtroom arena combine to \nform an atmosphere\u0014\n                      not conducive to reconciling relationships. A \nChristian who sues can\u0014\n                      become \"caught up\" in the system to the extent \nthat he takes on a\u0014\n                      bitter, self-righteous, and disingenuous \nmindset.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This, in turn, can lead him to overlook the \nblessing hidden in conflict,\u0014\n                      an opportunity to demonstrate godly character \nin the face of\u0014\n                      adversity. It also minimizes God's concern \nabout the \"weightier\u0014\n                      matters of the law\"justice, mercy, and \nfaithfulness (Matt. 23:23).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even though he may be legally \"right\" to do so, \na Christian who\u0014\n                      pursues a legal remedy outside the circle of \nother believers\u0014\n                      (especially when the church has authority over \nthe matter) can end\u0014\n                      up cheating his brother by depriving him of the \nopportunity to receive\u0014\n                      godly counsel to deal properly with both the \ndispute at hand and\u0014\n                      things of an eternal nature. The secular legal \nsystem simply lacks\u0014\n                      the wherewithal and the desire to deal with \nthese \"weightier matters.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The good news is that the body of Christ has \nmany competent, wise\u0014\n                      persons who are gifted in peacemaking and \nconflict resolution. These\u0014\n                      members, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, \ncan help people\u0014\n                      reconcile their relationships with each other \nas well as resolve their\u0014\n                      legal disputes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What's more, the American judicial system often \nallows disputing\u0014\n                      partieseven after the filing of a suitto \nresolve their conflicts in a\u0014\n                      private, nonadversarial forum (e.g., through \nmediation or arbitration\u0014\n                      with the assistance of a trained facilitator, \nmany of whom are\u0014\n                      committed Christians). After resolving the \nmatter, the parties may\u0014\n                      petition the court to incorporate the mediated \nagreement or the\u0014\n                      arbiter's decision into a court order.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This process can provide Christians with \nsomething that is sorely\u0014\n                      lacking in our nation's courtrooms: a protected \nsetting where God's\u0014\n                      voice can be heard, where parties can \ncommunicate with each other\u0014\n                      and disclose their errors without fear of \nscorn, where forgiveness can\u0014\n                      be requested and extended, where true \nrestoration can be fostered,\u0014\n                      and where the legal details can be handled \nproperly. I have witnessed\u0014\n                      this process work successfully in a variety of \ncases, from\u0014\n                      church-related feuds to contract disputes and \nemployment\u0014\n                      discrimination.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Which brings us back to the question. The \nstated cautions and\u0014\n                      principles generally are true for \nChristian/non-Christian relations as\u0014\n                      well. We are called to show charity to our \nneighbor, whether he is a\u0014\n                      believer or not. Even if the non-Christian \nresists our conciliatory\u0014\n                      gestures, we still control our own actions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Am I saying that a Christian must never sue? \nNo. There will be\u0014\n                      situations in which one has no choice but to \nseek legal recourse to\u0014\n                      resolve a conflict. I am saying, however, that \nChristian-initiated\u0014\n                      lawsuits should be rare. Moreover, if a \nChristian does sue, he should\u0014\n                      do so only after taking the following steps:\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Prayerful self-examination that is not \ntainted by anger over the other\u0014\n                      party's actions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Counsel from a trusted and neutral Christian \nadviser.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Genuine attempts at resolution using the \nprinciples laid out in\u0014\n                      Matthew 18.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       A determination that the lawsuit can be \nhandled with integrity and\u0014\n                      will not tarnish one's Christian witness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If we name Christ as Lord, we can rejoice even \nin the midst of conflict\u0014\n                      when we remember that God never calls us to do \nanything without\u0014\n                      first equipping us to do itincluding pursuing \npeace with all people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Alice Curtis is an associate professor at the \nRegent University School of\u0014\n                      Law in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\u0014",

    "words": "John Claypool, when he was the preacher of the Crescent Hill Baptist \nChurch here in town, had a little daughter who suffered with \nleukemia. When she went into remission, everybody thought maybe God \nhad healed her. On an Easter Sunday morning she went into a terrible \nrecurrence. In his book, \"Tracks of a Fellow Struggler,\" Claypool \nrelates how for two weeks his daughter was wracked with pain, her \neyes swollen shut. She asked him, \"Daddy, did you talk to God about \nmy leukemia?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     He said, \"Yes, dear, we've been praying for you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     She asked, \"Did you ask him how long the leukemia would last? \nWhat did God say?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     What do you say to your daughter when you can't help her, and \nthe heavens are silent? Emotionally and spiritually he was exhausted. \nA few hours later, she died. The following Sunday morning, John \nClaypool got into the pulpit to preach. I've heard the tape. It's one \nof the most powerful sermons I've heard. He preached on (Isaiah \n40:31), which says, \"Those who hope in the Lord will renew their \nstrength. They will soar on  wings like eagles; they will run and not \ngrow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Dr. Claypool said something to the effect, \"There are three \nstages of life. Sometimes we mount up with wings as an eagle and fly. \nWe're on top of the world. Sometimes we run, and we don't grow weary. \nWe just go through the routine. Sometimes it's all we can do to walk \nand not faint, and I need your prayers and your encouragement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     At the moment John Claypool was at his lowest, he preached \nprobably his most influential sermon. Perhaps his greatest \ncontribution came at his darkest hour. He could have said like Paul, \n\"For when I am weak, then I am strong.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Special Report: The Day of the Attack\u0014\n              Heroism was everywhere as the U.S. dealt with the \nbloodiest day on its soil\u0014\n              since the Civil War. Inside the hijackings, the \ninvestigation and the day the\u0014\n              World Trade Center came down  \u0014\n              BY NANCY GIBBS \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                     Wednesday, Sep. \n12, 2001\u0014\n                                                     If you want to \nhumble an\u0014\n                                                     empire it makes \nsense to\u0014\n                                                     maim its \ncathedrals.\u0014\n                                                     They are symbols \nof its\u0014\n                                                     faith, and when \nthey\u0014\n                                                     crumple and \nburn, it tells\u0014\n                                                     us we are not so\u0014\n                                                     powerful and we \ncan't be\u0014\n                                                     safe. The Twin \nTowers of\u0014\n                                                     the World Trade \nCenter,\u0014\n                                                     planted at the \nbase of\u0014\n                                                     Manhattan island \nwith the\u0014\n                                                     Statue of \nLiberty as their\u0014\n                                                     sentry, and the\u0014\n              Pentagon, a squat, concrete fort on the banks of the \nPotomac, are the\u0014\n              sanctuaries of money and power that our enemies may \nimagine define us.\u0014\n              But that assumes our faith rests on what we can buy and \nbuild, and that\u0014\n              has never been America's true God.\u0014\n\u0014\n              On a normal day, we value heroism because it is \nuncommon. On Sept. 11,\u0014\n              we valued heroism because it was everywhere. The fire \nfighters kept\u0014\n              climbing the stairs of the tallest buildings in town, \neven as the steel\u0014\n              moaned and the cracks spread in zippers through the \nwalls, to get to the\u0014\n              people trapped in the sky. We don't know yet how many \nof them died, but\u0014\n              once we know, as Mayor Rudy Giuliani said, \"it will be \nmore than we can\u0014\n              bear.\" That sentiment was played out in miniature in \nthe streets, where\u0014\n              fleeing victims pulled the wounded to safety, and at \nevery hospital, where\u0014\n              the lines to give blood looped round and round the \nblock. At the\u0014\n              medical-supply companies, which sent supplies without \nbeing asked. At\u0014\n              Verizon, where a worker threw on a New York fire \ndepartment jacket to go\u0014\n              save people. And then again and again all across the \ncountry, as people\u0014\n              checked on those they loved to find out if they were \nsafe and then looked\u0014\n              for some way to help.\u0014\n\u0014\n              This was the bloodiest day on American soil\u0014\n              since our Civil War, a modern Antietam\u0014\n              played out in real time, on fast-forward, and\u0014\n              not with soldiers but with secretaries, security\u0014\n              guards, lawyers, bankers, janitors. It was\u0014\n              strange that a day of war was a day we stood\u0014\n              still. We couldn't move--that must have been\u0014\n              the whole idea--so we had no choice but to\u0014\n              watch. Every city cataloged its targets;\u0014\n              residents looked at their skylines, wondering\u0014\n              if they would be different in the morning. The\u0014\n              Sears Tower in Chicago was evacuated, as\u0014\n              were colleges and museums. Disney World\u0014\n              shut down, and Major League Baseball\u0014\n              canceled its games, and nuclear power\u0014\n              plants went to top security status; the Hoover\u0014\n              Dam and the Mall of America shut down, and\u0014\n              Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and\u0014\n              Mount Rushmore. It was as though someone\u0014\n              had taken a huge brush and painted a\u0014\n              bull's-eye around every place Americans\u0014\n              gather, every icon we revere, every service\u0014\n              we depend on, and vowed to take them out\u0014\n              or shut them down, or force us to do it\u0014\n              ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Terror works like a musical composition, so\u0014\n              many instruments, all in tune, playing\u0014\n              perfectly together to create their desired\u0014\n              effect. Sorrow and horror, and fear. The first\u0014\n              plane is just to get our attention. Then, once\u0014\n              we are transfixed, the second plane comes\u0014\n              and repeats the theme until the blinding coda\u0014\n              of smoke and debris crumbles on top of the\u0014\n              rescue workers who have gone in to try to\u0014\n              save anyone who survived the opening\u0014\n              movements. And we watch, speechless, as\u0014\n              the sirens, like some awful choir, hour after\u0014\n              hour let you know that it is not over yet, wait,\u0014\n              there's more.\u0014\n\u0014\n              It was, of course, a perfect day, 70[degrees]\u0014\n              and flawless skies, perfect for a nervous pilot\u0014\n              who has stolen a huge jet and intends to turn\u0014\n              it into a missile. It was a Boeing 767 from\u0014\n              Boston, American Airlines Flight 11 bound for\u0014\n              Los Angeles with 81 passengers, that first got the \nattention of air traffic\u0014\n              controllers. The plane took off at 7:59 a.m. and headed \nwest, over the\u0014\n              Adirondacks, before taking a sudden turn south and \ndiving down toward\u0014\n              the heart of New York City. Meanwhile American Flight \n757 had left Dulles;\u0014\n              United Flight 175 left Boston at 7:58, and United \nFlight 93 left Newark three\u0014\n              minutes later, bound for San Francisco. All climbed \ninto beautiful clear\u0014\n              skies, all four planes on transcontinental flights, \nplump with fuel, ripe to\u0014\n              explode. \"They couldn't carry anything--other than an \natom bomb--that\u0014\n              could be as bad as what they were flying,\" observed a \nveteran investigator.\u0014\n\u0014\n              The first plane hit the World Trade Center's north \ntower at 8:45, ripping\u0014\n              through the building's skin and setting its upper \nfloors ablaze. People\u0014\n              thought it was a sonic boom, or a construction \naccident, or freak lightning\u0014\n              on a lovely fall day; at worst, a horrible airline \naccident, a plane losing\u0014\n              altitude, out of control, a pilot trying to ditch in \nthe river and missing. But as\u0014\n              the gruesome rains came--bits of plane, a tire, office \nfurniture, glass, a\u0014\n              hand, a leg, whole bodies, began falling all \naround--people in the streets\u0014\n              all stopped and looked, and fell silent. As the smoke \nrose, the ash rained\u0014\n              gently down, along with a whole lost flock of paper \nshuffling down from the\u0014\n              sky to the street below, edges charred, plane tickets \nand account\u0014\n              statements and bills and reports and volumes and \nvolumes of unfinished\u0014\n              business floating down to earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Almost instantly, a distant wail of sirens came from \nall directions, even as\u0014\n              people poured from the building, even as a second plane \nbore down on\u0014\n              lower Manhattan. Louis Garcia was among the first \nmedics on the scene.\u0014\n              \"There were people running over to us burnt from head \nto toe. Their hair\u0014\n              was burned off. There were compound fractures, arms and \nlegs sticking\u0014\n              out of the skin. One guy had no hair left on his head.\" \nOf the six patients in\u0014\n              his first ambulance run, two died on the way to St. \nVincent's Hospital.\u0014\nThe Day of the Attack -- 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5\u0014\n\u0014\n              Gilbert Richard Ramirez works for BlueCross BlueShield \non the 20th floor\u0014\n              of the north tower. After the explosion he ran to the \nwindows and saw the\u0014\n              debris falling, and sheets of white building material, \nand then something\u0014\n              else. \"There was a body. It looked like a man's body, a \nfull-size man.\" The\u0014\n              features were indistinguishable as it fell: the body \nwas black, apparently\u0014\n              charred. Someone pulled an emergency alarm switch, but \nnothing\u0014\n              happened. Someone else broke into the emergency phone, \nbut it was\u0014\n              dead. People began to say their prayers. \u0014\n\u0014\n              \"Relax, we're going to get out of here,\"\u0014\n              Ramirez said. \"I was telling them, Breathe,\u0014\n              breathe, Christ is on our side, we're gonna\u0014\n              get out of here.'\" He prodded everyone out\u0014\n              the door, herding stragglers. It was an eerie\u0014\n              walk down the smoky stairs, a path to safety\u0014\n              that ran through the suffering. They saw\u0014\n              people who had been badly burned. Their\u0014\n              skin, he says, \"was like a grayish color, and it\u0014\n              was like dripping, or peeling, like the skin was\u0014\n              peeling off their body.\" One woman was\u0014\n              screaming. \"She said she lost her friend, her\u0014\n              friend went out the window, a gust sucked\u0014\n              her out.\" As they descended, they were\u0014\n              passed by fire fighters and rescue workers,\u0014\n              panting, pushing their way up the stairs in\u0014\n              their heavy boots and gear. \"At least 50 of\u0014\n              them must have passed us,\" says Ramirez. \"I\u0014\n              told them, Do a good job.'\" He pauses. \"I saw\u0014\n              those guys one time, but they're not gonna\u0014\n              be there again.\" When he got outside to the\u0014\n              street there were bodies scattered on the\u0014\n              ground, and then another came plummeting,\u0014\n              and another. \"Every time I looked up at the\u0014\n              building, somebody was jumping from it. Like\u0014\n              from 107, Windows on the World. There was\u0014\n              one, and then another one. I couldn't\u0014\n              understand their jumping. I guess they\u0014\n              couldn't see any hope.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              The terror triggered other reactions besides\u0014\n              heroism. Robert Falcon worked in the\u0014\n              parking garage at the towers: \"When the\u0014\n              blast shook it went dark and we all went\u0014\n              down, and I had a flashlight and everyone\u0014\n              was screaming at me. People were ripping\u0014\n              my shirt to try and get to my flashlight, and\u0014\n              they were crushing me. The whole crowd was\u0014\n              on top of me wanting the flashlight.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n              Michael Otten, an assistant vice president at\u0014\n              Mizuho Capital Markets, was headed down\u0014\n              the stairs around the 46th floor when the\u0014\n              announcement came over the loudspeakers\u0014\n              that the south tower was secure, people\u0014\n              could go back to their desks or leave the\u0014\n              building. He proceeded to the 44th floor, an \nelevator-transfer floor. One\u0014\n              elevator loaded up and headed down, then came back \nempty, so he and a\u0014\n              crowd of others piled in. One man's backpack kept the \ndoors from closing.\u0014\n              The seconds ticked by. \"We wanted to say something, but \nthe worst thing\u0014\n              you can do is go against each other, and just as I \nthought it was going to\u0014\n              close, it was about 9:00, 9:03, whenever it was that \nthe second plane\u0014\n              crashed into the building. The walls of the elevator \ncaved in; they fell on a\u0014\n              couple people.\" Otten and others groped through the \ndust to find a\u0014\n              stairway, but the doors were locked. Finally they found \na clearer passage,\u0014\n              found a stairway they could get into and fled down to \nthe street.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Even as people streamed down the stairs, the cracks \nwere appearing in\u0014\n              the walls as the building shuddered and cringed. Steam \npipes burst, and at\u0014\n              one point an elevator door burst open and a man fell \nout, half burned\u0014\n              alive, his skin hanging off. People dragged him out of \nthe elevator and\u0014\n              helped get him out of the building to the doctors \nbelow. \"If I had listened to\u0014\n              the announcement,\" says survivor Joan Feldman, \"I'd be \ndead right now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              Felipe Oyola and his wife Adianes did listen to the \nannouncement. When\u0014\n              Oyola heard the first explosion in his office on the \n81st floor of the south\u0014\n              tower, he raced down to the 78th floor to find her. \nThey met at the elevator\u0014\n              bank; she was terrified. But when the announcement came \nover the\u0014\n              loudspeaker that the tower was safe, they both went \nback to work. Oyola\u0014\n              was back on 81 when the second plane arrived. \"As soon \nas I went\u0014\n              upstairs, I looked out the window, and I see falling \ndebris and people. Then\u0014\n              the office was on top of me. I managed to escape, and \nI've been looking for\u0014\n              my wife ever since.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              United flight 175 left boston at 7:58 a.m., headed to \nLos Angeles. When it\u0014\n              passed the Massachusetts-Connecticut border, it made a \n30-degree turn,\u0014\n              and then an even sharper turn and swooped down on \nManhattan, between\u0014\n              the buildings, to impale the south tower at 9:06. This \nplane seemed to hit\u0014\n              lower and harder; maybe that's because by now every \ncamera in the city\u0014\n              was trained on the towers, and the crowds in the \nstreet, refugees from the\u0014\n              first explosion, were there to see it. Desks and chairs \nand people were\u0014\n              sucked out the windows and rained down on the streets \nbelow. Men and\u0014\n              women, cops and fire fighters watched and wept. As fire \nand debris fell,\u0014\n              cars blew up; the air smelled of smoke and concrete, \nthat smell that spits\u0014\n              out of jackhammers chewing up pavement. You could taste \nthe air more\u0014\n              easily than you could breathe it.\u0014\n\u0014\n              P.S. 89 is an elementary school just up the street; \nmost of the families live\u0014\n              and work in the financial district, and when bedlam \nbroke, mothers and\u0014\n              fathers ran toward the school, sweat pouring off them, \nfrantic to get to their\u0014\n              kids. Some people who didn't know if their spouse had \nsurvived met up at\u0014\n              school, because both parents went straight to the kids. \n\"I just wanted to\u0014\n              find my kids and my wife and get the hell off this \nisland,\" said one father.\u0014\n              And together they walked, he and his wife and young son \nand daughter,\u0014\n              60 blocks or so up to Grand Central and safety.\u0014\n\u0014\n              The first crash had changed everything; the second \nchanged it again.\u0014\n              Anyone who thought the first was an accident now knew \nbetter. This was\u0014\n              not some awful, isolated episode, not Oklahoma City, \nnot even the first\u0014\n              World Trade Center bombing. Now this felt like a war, \nand the system\u0014\n              responded accordingly; the emergency plans came out of \nthe drawers and\u0014\n              clicked one by one into place. The city buckled, the \ntraffic stopped, the\u0014\n              bridges and tunnels were shut down at 9:35 as warnings \ntumbled one after\u0014\n              another; the Empire State Building was evacuated, and \nthe Metropolitan\u0014\n              Museum of Art, the United Nations. First the New York \nairports were closed,\u0014\n              then Washington's, and then the whole country was \ngrounded for the first\u0014\n              time in history. \u0014\n\u0014\n              At the moment the second plane was slamming into the \nsouth tower,\u0014\n              President Bush was being introduced to the \nsecond-graders of Emma E.\u0014\n              Booker Elementary in Sarasota, Fla. When he arrived at \nthe school he had\u0014\n              been whisked into a holding room: National Security \nAdviser Condoleezza\u0014\n              Rice needed to speak to him. But he soon appeared in \nthe classroom and\u0014\n              listened appreciatively as the children went through \ntheir reading drill. As\u0014\n              he was getting ready to pose for pictures with the \nteachers and kids, chief\u0014\n              of staff Andy Card entered the room, walked over to the \nPresident and\u0014\n              whispered in his right ear. The President's face became \nvisibly tense and\u0014\n              serious. He nodded. Card left and for several minutes \nthe President\u0014\n              seemed distracted and somber, but then he resumed his \ninteraction with\u0014\n              the class. \"Really good readers, whew!\" he told them. \n\"These must be\u0014\n              sixth-graders!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              Meanwhile, in the room where Bush was scheduled to give \nhis remarks,\u0014\n              about 200 people, including local officials, school \npersonnel and students,\u0014\n              waited under the hot lights. Word of the crash began to \ncirculate; reporters\u0014\n              called their editors, but details were sparseuntil \nsomeone remembered\u0014\n              there was a TV in a nearby office. The President \nfinally entered, about 35\u0014\n              minutes late, and made his brief comments. \"This is a \ndifficult time for\u0014\n              America,\" he began. He ordered a massive investigation \nto \"hunt down the\u0014\n              folks who committed this act.\" Meanwhile the bomb dogs \ntook a few extra\u0014\n              passes through Air Force One, and an extra fighter \nescort was added. But\u0014\n              the President too was going to have trouble getting \nhome. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Even as the President spoke, the second front opened. \nHaving hit the\u0014\n              country's financial and cultural heart, the killers \nwent for its political and\u0014\n              military muscles. David Marra, 23, an \ninformation-technology specialist,\u0014\n              had turned his BMW off an I-395 exit to the highway \njust west of the\u0014\n              Pentagon when he saw an American Airlines jet swooping \nin, its wings\u0014\n              wobbly, looking like it was going to slam right into \nthe Pentagon: \"It was 50\u0014\n              ft. off the deck when he came in. It sounded like the \npilot had the throttle\u0014\n              completely floored. The plane rolled left and then \nrolled right. Then he\u0014\n              caught an edge of his wing on the ground.\" There is a \nhelicopter pad right\u0014\n              in front of the side of the Pentagon. The wing touched \nthere, then the\u0014\n              plane cartwheeled into the building. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Two minutes later, a \"credible threat\" forced the \nevacuation of the White\u0014\n              House, and eventually State and Justice and all the \nfederal office buildings.\u0014\n              Secret Service officers had automatic weapons drawn as \nthey patrolled\u0014\n              Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Police-car \nradios crackled\u0014\n              with reports that rogue airplanes had been spotted over \nthe White House.\u0014\n              The planes turned out to be harmless civilian aircraft \nthat air-traffic\u0014\n              controllers at National Airport were scrambling to help \nland so they could\u0014\n              clear the air space over the nation's capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that was not all; there was a third front as well. At 9:58 the\u0014\n              Westmoreland County emergency-operations center, 35 \nmiles southeast of\u0014\n              Pittsburgh, received a frantic cell-phone call from a \nman who said he was\u0014\n              locked in the rest room aboard United Flight 93. Glenn \nCramer, the\u0014\n              dispatch supervisor, said the man was distraught and \nkept repeating, \"We\u0014\n              are being hijacked! We are being hijacked!\" He also \nsaid this was not a\u0014\n              hoax, and that the plane \"was going down.\" Said Cramer: \n\"He heard some\u0014\n              sort of explosion and saw white smoke coming from the \nplane. Then we lost\u0014\n              contact with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              The flight had taken off at 8:01 from Newark,\u0014\n              N.J., bound for San Francisco. But as it\u0014\n              passed south of Cleveland, Ohio, it took a\u0014\n              sudden, violent left turn and headed\u0014\n              inexplicably back into Pennsylvania. As the\u0014\n              757 and its 38 passengers and seven crew\u0014\n              members blew past Pittsburgh, air-traffic\u0014\n              controllers tried frantically to raise the crew\u0014\n              via radio. There was no response. Forty\u0014\n              miles further down the new flight path, in rural\u0014\n              Somerset County, Terry Butler, 40, was\u0014\n              pulling the radiator from a gray 1992 Dodge\u0014\n              Caravan at the junkyard where he works. He\u0014\n              had been watching the news and knew all\u0014\n              flights were supposed to be grounded. He\u0014\n              was stunned when he looked up in the sky\u0014\n              and saw Flight 93 cutting through the\u0014\n              lingering morning fog. \"It was moving like you\u0014\n              wouldn't believe,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n              The rogue plane soared over woodland,\u0014\n              cattle pastures and cornfields until it passed\u0014\n              over Kelly Leverknight's home. She too was\u0014\n              watching the news. Her husband, on his\u0014\n              regular tour of duty with the Air National\u0014\n              Guard's 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg,\u0014\n              W.Va., had just called to reassure his wife\u0014\n              that his base was still operating normally\u0014\n              when she heard the plane rush by. \"It was\u0014\n              headed toward the school,\" she said, the\u0014\n              school where her three children were. Had\u0014\n              Flight 93 stayed aloft a few seconds longer, it\u0014\n              would have plowed into\u0014\n              Shanksville-Stonycreek School and its 501\u0014\n              students, grades K through 12. Instead, at\u0014\n              10:06 a.m., the plane smashed into a\u0014\n              reclaimed section of an old coal strip mine.\u0014\n              The largest pieces of the plane still extant\u0014\n              are barely bigger than a telephone book. \"I\u0014\n              just keep thinkingtwo miles,\" said\u0014\n              elementary principal Rosemarie Tipton.\u0014\n              \"There but for the grace of Godtwo miles.\"\u0014\n              cia director george tenet was having a\u0014\n              leisurely breakfast with his mentor, former\u0014\n              Senator David Boren, at the St. Regis Hotel,\u0014\n              when he got the news. Their omelettes had\u0014\n              just arrived when Tenet's security detail descended \nwith a cell phone.\u0014\n              \"Give me the quick summary,\" Tenet said calmly into the \nphone. He\u0014\n              listened a few moments, and then told Boren: \"The World \nTrade Center\u0014\n              has been hit. We're pretty sure it wasn't an accident. \nIt looks like a terrorist\u0014\n              act.\" He then got back to the phone, named a dozen \npeople he wanted\u0014\n              summoned to the cia situation room. \"Assemble them in \n15 minutes,\" he\u0014\n              said. \"I should almost be there by then.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              Vice President Dick Cheney was in his West Wing office \nwhen the Secret\u0014\n              Service burst in, physically hurrying him out of the \nroom. \"We have to\u0014\n              move; we're moving now, Sir; we're moving,\" the agents \nsaid as they took\u0014\n              him to a bunker on the White House grounds. Once there, \nwith members of\u0014\n              the National Security staff and Administration \nofficials, they told Cheney\u0014\n              that a plane was headed for the White House. Mrs. \nCheney and Laura\u0014\n              Bush were brought in as well. Staff members in the Old \nExecutive Office\u0014\n              Building, across the street from the White House, were \nhuddled in front of\u0014\n              their TV screens when they heard from TV reporters that \nthey were being\u0014\n              evacuated. Then the tape loop began. \"The building is \nbeing evacuated.\u0014\n              Please walk to the nearest exit.\" \"The looks were \nstone-faced,\" a staff\u0014\n              member to the Vice President said. \"They were just \nzombies,\" said another.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont was heading to the \nSupreme Court\u0014\n              Building to speak to a group of appellate judges. He \nhad already heard the\u0014\n              news from New York City. As he walked into the court \nbuilding, he heard a\u0014\n              muffled boom outside. It was the plane attacking the \nPentagon. \"I've got to\u0014\n              tell you before we start there's some horrible, \nhorrible news coming in,\"\u0014\n              Leahy told the roomful of judges. By the time he was \nleaving the building,\u0014\n              there were already 20 cops surrounding it. As he neared \nthe Russell\u0014\n              Senate Office Building, a Capitol policeman walked up: \n\"Senator, I don't\u0014\n              know if you want to go back to your office,\" he warned. \n\"They're evacuating\u0014\n              the buildings.\" \"I've got a lot of staff still working \nthere,\" Leahy snapped.\u0014\n              \"I'm not going to leave them in the building.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              Washington was supposed to have contingency plans for \ndisasters like\u0014\n              this, but the chaos on the streets was clear evidence \nthat plans still\u0014\n              needed work. By 10:45 a.m. the downtown streets around \nthe Capitol,\u0014\n              government buildings and White House were laced with \ncars pointing in\u0014\n              every direction, unable to move. A security officer for \none of the buildings\u0014\n              sat on a park bench. He had been locked out of his \nbuilding, so he didn't\u0014\n              have a clue if the senior officials inside were out and \nin a safe place. \"I'm\u0014\n              not surprised at this,\" he said. \"We aren't prepared. \nWe were supposed to\u0014\n              have a plan to evacuate our Cabinet officer to a place \n50 miles out, but\u0014\n              none of that has been done.\" Capitol police were slow \nto move as well.\u0014\n              There was no increased security, no heightened alert \naround the Capitol\u0014\n              for fully half an hour after the New York attack. \nSenate minority leader\u0014\n              Trent Lott was drafting a press release to condemn the \nattack when he\u0014\n              looked outside his window and saw black smoke billowing \nup from across\u0014\n              the Potomac. He didn't wait for an evacuation order. He \ngathered up his\u0014\n              top staff and security detail and headed out of the \nCapitol, shocked to find\u0014\n              that tourists were still walking into the building \nwhile he was fleeing it. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Senator Robert Byrd, the Senate's president pro tempore \nand fourth in line\u0014\n              to the presidency, was put in a chauffeured car and \ndriven to a safe\u0014\n              house, as were Speaker Dennis Hastert and other \ncongressional leaders.\u0014\n              There were rumors flying that the fourth plane, the one \nthat went down in\u0014\n              Pennsylvania, had been headed for the Capitol or Camp \nDavid. The safe\u0014\n              houses are scattered throughout the Washington, \nnorthern Virginia and\u0014\n              southern Maryland area. The Secret Service has similar \nsafe houses\u0014\n              where they can take the Vice President and other top \nAdministration\u0014\n              officials as well. They are homes, offices, in some \ncases even fire stations,\u0014\n              that have secure phones so that the leaders can still \ncommunicate.\u0014\n\u0014\n              By 11 a.m., the streets in washington were gridlocked \nwith people trying to\u0014\n              get out. In a place that doesn't tend to carpool, \nco-workers had stuffed\u0014\n              themselves into available vehicles. Both the 14th \nStreet Bridge and\u0014\n              Arlington Memorial Bridge, leading to Virginia and past \nthe Pentagon, had\u0014\n              been closed, as were the airports and Union Station. On \nthe corner of\u0014\n              Constitution Avenue and 14th Street, day-care workers \nfrom the Ronald\u0014\n              Reagan Building clutched frightened toddlers into a \ntight bunch. Hysteria\u0014\n              was gripping the city: senior generals at the Pentagon \nphoned children\u0014\n              and other relatives, warning them not to drink tap \nwater for the next 36\u0014\n              hours. They feared reservoirs might be poisoned. Fed \nChairman Alan\u0014\n              Greenspan was flying back to the U.S. from Switzerland \nwhen his airliner\u0014\n              was ordered to turn back. He reached vice chairman \nRoger Ferguson by\u0014\n              phone as soon as he could, and Ferguson coordinated \ncontacts with\u0014\n              Reserve banks and Governors both in Washington and \naround the\u0014\n              country. The goal: to make sure U.S. banks would keep \nfunctioning. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Meanwhile, the mood on board Air Force One could not \nhave been more\u0014\n              tense. Bush was in his office in the front of the \nplane, on the phone with\u0014\n              Cheney, National Security Adviser Rice, FBI director \nRobert Mueller and\u0014\n              the First Lady. Cheney told him that law-enforcement \nand security\u0014\n              agencies believed the White House and Air Force One \nwere both targets.\u0014\n              Bush, the Vice President insisted, should head to a \nsafe military base as\u0014\n              soon as possible. White House staff members, Air Force \nflight attendants\u0014\n              and Secret Service agents all were subdued and shaken. \nOne agent sadly\u0014\n              reported that the Secret Service field office in New \nYork City, with its 200\u0014\n              agents, was located in the World Trade Center. The \nplane's TV monitors\u0014\n              were tuned in to local news broadcasts; Bush was \nwatching as the second\u0014\n              tower collapsed. About 45 minutes after takeoff, a \ndecision was made to fly\u0014\n              to Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska, site of the \nnation's nuclear command\u0014\n              and one of the most secure military installations in \nthe country. But Bush\u0014\n              and his aides didn't want to wait that long before the \nPresident could make\u0014\n              a public statement. Secret Service officials and \nmilitary advisers in\u0014\n              Washington consulted a map and chose a spot for Bush to \nmake a brief\u0014\n              touchdown: Barksdale Air Force Base, outside of \nShreveport, La. In Bush's\u0014\n              airborne office, aides milled about while Bush spoke on \nthe phone. \"That's\u0014\n              what we're paid for, boys,\" he said. \"We're gonna take \ncare of this. We're\u0014\n              going to find out who did this. They're not going to \nlike me as President.\"\u0014\n              The handful of reporters aboard were told not to use \ntheir cell\u0014\n              phonesand not even to turn them onbecause the signals \nmight allow\u0014\n              someone to identify the plane's location. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Air Force One landed at Barksdale at 11:45 a.m., with \nfighter jets hovering\u0014\n              beside each wing throughout the descent. The perimeter \nwas surrounded\u0014\n              by Air Force personnel in full combat gear: green \nfatigues, flak jackets,\u0014\n              helmets, M-16s at the ready. The small motorcade \ntraveled to Building\u0014\n              245. A sign on the glass windows of several doors, in \nlarge black type,\u0014\n              read defcon delta. That is the highest possible state \nof military alert. Bush\u0014\n              made his second remarks at 12:36 from a windowless \nconference room, in\u0014\n              front of two American flags dragged together by Air \nForce privates.\u0014\n              \"Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless \ncoward,\" he\u0014\n              began, then spoke for two minutes before leaving the \nroom.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Meanwhile, in the room where Bush was scheduled to give \nhis remarks,\u0014\n              about 200 people, including local officials, school \npersonnel and students,\u0014\n              waited under the hot lights. Word of the crash began to \ncirculate; reporters\u0014\n              called their editors, but details were sparse--until \nsomeone remembered\u0014\n              there was a TV in a nearby office. The President \nfinally entered, about 35\u0014\n              minutes late, and made his brief comments. \"This is a \ndifficult time for\u0014\n              America,\" he began. He ordered a massive investigation \nto \"hunt down the\u0014\n              folks who committed this act.\" Meanwhile the bomb dogs \ntook a few extra\u0014\n              passes through Air Force One, and an extra fighter \nescort was added. But\u0014\n              the President too was going to have trouble getting \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Even as the President spoke, the second\u0014\n              front opened. Having hit the country's\u0014\n              financial and cultural heart, the killers went\u0014\n              for its political and military muscles. David\u0014\n              Marra, 23, an information-technology\u0014\n              specialist, had turned his BMW off an I-395\u0014\n              exit to the highway just west of the Pentagon\u0014\n              when he saw an American Airlines jet\u0014\n              swooping in, its wings wobbly, looking like it\u0014\n              was going to\u0014",

It\u0014\n              sounded like the pilot had the throttle\u0014\n              completely floored. The plane rolled left and\u0014\n              then rolled right. Then he caught an edge of\u0014\n              his wing on the ground.\" There is a helicopter\u0014\n              pad right in front of the side of the Pentagon.\u0014\n              The wing touched there, then the plane\u0014\n              cartwheeled into the building.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Two minutes later, a \"credible threat\" forced\u0014\n              the evacuation of the White House, and\u0014\n              eventually State and Justice and all the\u0014\n              federal office buildings. Secret Service\u0014\n              officers had automatic weapons drawn as\u0014\n              they patrolled Lafayette Park, across from\u0014\n              the White House. Police-car radios crackled\u0014\n              with reports that rogue airplanes had been\u0014\n              spotted over the White House. The planes\u0014\n              turned out to be harmless civilian aircraft that\u0014\n              air-traffic controllers at National Airport were\u0014\n              scrambling to help land so they could clear\u0014\n              the air space over the nation's capital.\u0014\n\u0014\n              But that was not all; there was a third front as\u0014\n              well. At 9:58 the Westmoreland County\u0014\n              emergency-operations center, 35 miles\u0014\n              southeast of Pittsburgh, received a frantic\u0014\n              cell-phone call from a man who said he was\u0014\n              locked in the rest room aboard United Flight\u0014\n              93. Glenn Cramer, the dispatch supervisor,\u0014\n              said the man was distraught and kept\u0014\n              repeating, \"We are being hijacked! We are\u0014\n              being hijacked!\" He also said this was not a\u0014\n              hoax, and that the plane \"was going down.\"\u0014\n              Said Cramer: \"He heard some sort of\u0014\n              explosion and saw white smoke coming from\u0014\n              the plane. Then we lost contact with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              The flight had taken off at 8:01 from Newark, N.J., \nbound for San\u0014\n              Francisco. But as it passed south of Cleveland, Ohio, \nit took a sudden,\u0014\n              violent left turn and headed inexplicably back into \nPennsylvania. As the\u0014\n              757 and its 38 passengers and seven crew members blew \npast Pittsburgh,\u0014\n              air-traffic controllers tried frantically to raise the \ncrew via radio. There was\u0014\n              no response.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Forty miles further down the new flight path, in rural \nSomerset County,\u0014\n              Terry Butler, 40, was pulling the radiator from a gray \n1992 Dodge Caravan\u0014\n              at the junkyard where he works. He had been watching \nthe news and knew\u0014\n              all flights were supposed to be grounded. He was \nstunned when he looked\u0014\n              up in the sky and saw Flight 93 cutting through the \nlingering morning fog.\u0014\n              \"It was moving like you wouldn't believe,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n              The rogue plane soared over woodland, cattle pastures \nand cornfields\u0014\n              until it passed over Kelly Leverknight's home. She too \nwas watching the\u0014\n              news. Her husband, on his regular tour of duty with the \nAir National\u0014\n              Guard's 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg, W.Va., had \njust called to\u0014\n              reassure his wife that his base was still operating \nnormally when she heard\u0014\n              the plane rush by. \"It was headed toward the school,\" \nshe said, the school\u0014\n              where her three children were.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Had Flight 93 stayed aloft a few seconds longer, it \nwould have plowed into\u0014\n              Shanksville-Stonycreek School and its 501 students, \ngrades K through 12.\u0014\n              Instead, at 10:06 a.m., the plane smashed into a \nreclaimed section of an\u0014\n              old coal strip mine. The largest pieces of the plane \nstill extant are barely\u0014\n              bigger than a telephone book. \"I just keep \nthinking--two miles,\" said\u0014\n              elementary principal Rosemarie Tipton. \"There but for \nthe grace of\u0014\n              God--two miles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              CIA Director George Tenet was having a leisurely \nbreakfast with his\u0014\n              mentor, former Senator David Boren, at the St. Regis \nHotel, when he got\u0014\n              the news. Their omelettes had just arrived when Tenet's \nsecurity detail\u0014\n              descended with a cell phone. \"Give me the quick \nsummary,\" Tenet said\u0014\n              calmly into the phone. He listened a few moments, and \nthen told Boren:\u0014\n              \"The World Trade Center has been hit. We're pretty sure \nit wasn't an\u0014\n              accident. It looks like a terrorist act.\" He then got \nback to the phone,\u0014\n              named a dozen people he wanted summoned to the CIA \nsituation room.\u0014\n              \"Assemble them in 15 minutes,\" he said. \"I should \nalmost be there by then.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nthe warlike mobilization was by no means left to the stricken zones. \nAt\u0014\n              Chalkville Elementary School near Birmingham, Ala., \nmore than 700 calls\u0014\n              had been received from worried parents, many of whom \ncame at\u0014\n              midmorning to pick up their children. Churches and \nschools and civic\u0014\n              groups all around the country offered to help anyone \nstranded by the\u0014\n              grounding of the nation's planes. All over Los Angeles, \noffices and\u0014\n              government buildings were shut down and surrounded by \npolice: city hall,\u0014\n              the Federal Building in Westwood, even shopping malls. \nAt the Federal\u0014\n              Building, armored rescue vehicles and Ford cars ringed \nthe entrances and\u0014\n              exits, with FBI staffers decked out in black and \nbrandishing MP5 assault\u0014\n              rifles. Even Express Mail trucks were searched by the \nFBI before they were\u0014\n              allowed onto the premises. Gas pipeline companies were \nbeefing up\u0014\n              security at key transmission stations. Grand Coulee Dam \nin central\u0014\n              Washington State was locked down. Gasoline stations \naround the country\u0014\n              were running out of gas as motorists rushed to top off \ntheir tanks. \u0014\n\u0014\n              In Chicago, Steve Bernard was huddled\u0014\n              around the TV with colleagues on the 36th\u0014\n              floor of Chicago's Sears Tower, shortly after\u0014\n              8 a.m., watching the smoke billowing from the\u0014\n              World Trade Center after the first attack.\u0014\n              When the second plane hit, bewilderment at\u0014\n              a faraway spectacle turned into a much more\u0014\n              personal, creeping panic. The Chicago staff\u0014\n              of the Piper Jaffray investment firm suddenly\u0014\n              redirected their gazes toward the windows,\u0014\n              quietly searching for jets on their own\u0014\n              horizon. The 110-story Sears Tower, even\u0014\n              taller than the World Trade Center, is the\u0014\n              tallest building in the U.S.; a vulnerable\u0014\n              target. Bernard's wife called him and insisted\u0014\n              he come home. Within an hour, the building\u0014\n              was evacuated.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Across the country, houses of all kinds of\u0014\n              worship filled with grieving Americans singing\u0014\n              America the Beautiful, wiping away streams\u0014\n              of tears. \"Humanity came apart in lower\u0014\n              Manhattan today, and each of us is\u0014\n              wounded. We mourn the loss of our\u0014\n              innocence,\" declared Rabbi Gary Gerson at\u0014\n              Oak Park Temple, a Reform Jewish\u0014\n              congregation outside Chicago. \"Terror has\u0014\n              struck us, but it will not destroy us. Now we\u0014\n              are all Israelis,\" he added.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Indeed, there were many Americans who\u0014\n              refused to be intimidated by the tragedy,\u0014\n              rightly or wrongly. They were reassuring, if\u0014\n              not necessarily reasonable. The order to\u0014\n              close the U.S. Courthouse in Little Rock,\u0014\n              Ark., came shortly before 10 a.m., and it was\u0014\n              promptly heeded by everyone except a\u0014\n              solitary federal district judge. There sat\u0014\n              Henry Woods, age 83, his lined face framed\u0014\n              by a mane of white hair, beneath a replica of\u0014\n              the seal of the U.S. Around him, at his\u0014\n              insistence, a jury and lawyers carried on in a\u0014\n              damage suit stemming from, of all things, a\u0014\n              1999 American Airlines crash. \"This looks like\u0014\n              an intelligent jury to me,\" Woods said,\u0014\n              explaining his refusal to grant a mistrial to the\u0014\n              defense after getting word of the disaster. \"And I \ndidn't want the judicial\u0014\n              system interrupted by a terrorist act, no matter how \nhorrible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n              If people all over the country had a sense of being \nsuddenly at warchat\u0014\n              boards on Yahoo filled up with people wanting to \nvolunteer for military\u0014\n              serviceit was with an enemy they could not see and not \neasily touch. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Meanwhile the U.S. government reassembled and \nmobilized. Secretary of\u0014\n              State Colin Powell cut short his trip to Latin America \nto return to the U.S. By\u0014\n              midafternoon, members of Congress were calling on their \nleaders to\u0014\n              summon a special session, to show the world the \ngovernment was up and\u0014\n              running. About half of the Senate convened in a \nconference room at the\u0014\n              Capitol Hill Police Station to hear from their \nleaderssome to vent their\u0014\n              outrage at President Bush. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans wanted to\u0014\n              know, Where is he? Why isn't he here? Why isn't he in \nNew York? Why\u0014\n              isn't he talking to the country? The answer: Bush had \nbeen told by the\u0014\n              Secret Service, the military and the FBI that it was \nnot yet safe to return to\u0014\n              Washington. Only 24 hours later, after absorbing a wave \nof criticism for his\u0014\n              delayed return, did aides claim there had been \n\"credible evidence\" that the\u0014\n              White House and Air Force One were targets.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Some Republicans on the Hill wanted to know why \nCounsellor Karen\u0014\n              Hughes was the highest government official anyone saw \non television all\u0014\n              day, other than Bush's brief, unsettling appearance in \nLouisiana. They\u0014\n              wanted to see Bush stride across the South Lawn and \nshow that this is not\u0014\n              a country that can be sent into hiding by cowards. \"He \nbetter have the\u0014\n              speech of his life ready tonight,\" sighed one \nRepublican strategist. Bush\u0014\n              did return a few hours later, did stride across the \nSouth Lawn and did\u0014\n              deliver a reasonably effective national address from \nthe Oval Office. But it\u0014\n              wasn't until the following day that he stepped up the \nintensity of his rhetoric\u0014\n              and declared the attacks \"acts of war.\" Tucked inside \nthe shock and fury\u0014\n              was dismay at the performance of others whose \njobperhaps\u0014\n              impossiblewas to prevent this from happening. There \nwere quiet calls for\u0014\n              the heads of cia chief Tenet and faa boss Jane Garvey \nfor allowing so\u0014\n              appalling a breach of security on their watch. And \nthere was an equal\u0014\n              determination to find those who were behind it.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Only God knows what kind of heroic acts took place at \n25,000 feet as\u0014\n              passengers and crews contended with four teams of \nhighly trained enemy\u0014\n              terrorists. But it is clear that the hunt for the \nculprits began way up in the\u0014\n              sky, by the doomed passengers and crews themselves, \nminutes before the\u0014\n              attacks took place. In their final goodbyes, on brief \nand haunting calls from\u0014\n              their cell phones, the victims on board at least two of \nthe four planes\u0014\n              whispered the number and even some of the seat \nassignments of the\u0014\n              terrorists. A flight attendant on board American Flight \n11 called her airline's\u0014\n              flight operations center in Dallas on a special airlink \nline and reported that\u0014\n              passengers were being stabbed.\u0014\n\u0014\n              That gave investigators a heads-up that something had \ngone terribly\u0014\n              wrong, but there were plenty of other clues. Even \nbefore the smoke had\u0014\n              cleared, it was obvious that the culprits knew their \nway around a Boeing\u0014\n              cockpitand all the security weaknesses in the U.S. \ncivil aviation system.\u0014\n              The enemy had chosen the quietest day of the week for \nthe operation,\u0014\n              when there would be fewer passengers to subdue; they \nhad boarded\u0014\n              westbound transcontinental flightsplanes fully loaded \nwith fuel. They\u0014\n              were armed with knives and box cutters, had gained \naccess to the cockpits\u0014\n              and herded everyone to the back of the plane. Once at \nthe controls, they\u0014\n              had turned off at least one of the aircraft's \nself-identifying beacons, known\u0014\n              as transponders, a move that renders the planes \nsomewhat less visible to\u0014\n              air traffic controllers. And each aircraft had gone \nthrough dramatic but\u0014\n              carefully executed course corrections, including a \nstunning last maneuver\u0014\n              by Flight 77. The pilot of that plane came in low from \nsouth of the\u0014\n              Pentagon, and pulled a 270 turn before slamming into \nthe west wall of the\u0014\n              building.\u0014\n\u0014\n              And though everyone wanted to be prudent, there weren't \na lot of suspects\u0014\n              to round up. Palestinian terror groups are experienced \nat suicide missions,\u0014\n              but have never attempted an operation this large. \nGroups with links to the\u0014\n              Iranian government took down the Khobar Towers in Saudi \nArabia in 1996,\u0014\n              killing 19, but that target was a long way from the \nU.S. Libya has lost its\u0014\n              taste for terror, most experts believe, and Iraq's \nSaddam Hussein has\u0014\n              always favored loud, brutish force over quiet finesse. \nBesides, no group\u0014\n              other than Osama bin Laden's loose knit network of \noperatives in dozens\u0014\n              of countries worldwide has ever shown the will, wallet \nor gall to attack the\u0014\n              U.S. before. Bin Laden is responsible for the attacks \non U.S. embassies in\u0014\n              Kenya and Tanzania. Three weeks ago when he told an \nArab journalist he\u0014\n              would mount an unprecedented attack on the U.S. \"This \nwas well funded\u0014\n              and well planned,\" said Senator Pat Roberts, who sits \non the Senate\u0014\n              Intelligence Committee. \"It took a lot of planning. The \nweather had to be\u0014\n              just so on the East Coast. They used sophisticated \ntactics where they\u0014\n              hijacked planes, killed the crew, and they had to have \naviators or\u0014\n              navigators who knew what they were doing.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n              Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage gathered his \nsenior aides in\u0014\n              the State Department's seventh-floor secure facility \nshortly after 9 a.m.\u0014\n              Tuesday for a videoconference with the Administration's \ntop national\u0014\n              security aides. National Security Adviser Rice and her \ntop counterterrorism\u0014\n              coordinator Richard Clark were on one screen, with FBI \nDirector Mueller\u0014\n              and his senior aides, the cia's counterterrorism \ndirector, and faa officials\u0014\n              on others. Vice President Cheney was supposed to be in \non the\u0014\n              teleconference, but the Secret Service had already \nspirited him off to a\u0014\n              safehouse. \"We knew we were in trouble,\" says one \nofficial who was\u0014\n              present. \"We've got suicide attacks here.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n              Rice stayed silent as the meeting progressed; Clark did \nmost of the talking.\u0014\n              Finally at around 9:45 a.m., aides behind Mueller \nstarted murmuring and\u0014\n              whispering into his ear. Mueller interrupted everyone. \n\"The Pentagon has\u0014\n              been hit by an airplane,\" the FBI chief announced. All \nthe State\u0014\n              Department officials turned their heads to Armitage, \nwho was running the\u0014\n              building in Powell's absence. \"Let's increase security \noutside the building,\"\u0014\n              Armitage said calmly, seeming unperturbed. Another aide \npiped up. \"We\u0014\n              probably need to think about getting the hell out of \nhere,\" he said.\u0014\n              Armitage decided to evacuate, and an alternate command \ncenter was set\u0014\n              up at the Foreign Service Institute in Arlington, Va. \nSenior State\u0014\n              Department aides jumped in staff cars to race to \nArlington but immediately\u0014\n              ran into clogged traffic in Washington. \u0014\n\u0014\n              By Tuesday afternoon, the spooks were making progress. \nEavesdroppers\u0014\n              at the supersecret National Security Agency had picked \nup at least two\u0014\n              electronic intercepts indicating the terrorists had \nties to bin Laden. By\u0014\n              nightfall, less than 12 hours after the attacks, U.S. \nofficials told Time that\u0014\n              their sense that he was involved had got closer to what \none senior official\u0014\n              said was 90%. The next morning, U.S. officials told \nTime they have\u0014\n              evidence that each of the four terrorist teams had a \ncertified pilot with\u0014\n              them; some of these pilots had flown for an airline in \nSaudi Arabia and\u0014\n              received pilot training in the U.S. It's not yet clear \nwhether the pilots were\u0014\n              trained in the U.S., or in Saudi Arabia or both. \nIntelligence officials believe\u0014\n              each team had four to six persons. Some team members, \nit is thought,\u0014\n              crossed the Canadian border to get into the U.S. \nSources told Time that\u0014\n              within the past few months, the FBI added to the U.S. \nwatch list two men\u0014\n              whom the bureau believed to be associated with one of \nthe Islamic Jihad\u0014\n              terror groups. Through a screwup, the suspects were \nlost. The two men\u0014\n              appear to have been on the American Airlines Flight 77, \nthe plane that\u0014\n              crashed into the Pentagon, sources told Time. Boston \nappears to have\u0014\n              been a central hub for the operation; U.S. intelligence \nbelieves a bin Laden\u0014\n              cell in Florida was a support group helping with the \naviation aspects of the\u0014\n              attack. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Intelligence officials poring over old reports believe \nthey got their first\u0014\n              inkling of planning for the attack last June, although \nat the time the\u0014\n              intelligence was too vague to indicate the scale of the \noperation. In the\u0014\n              summer U.S. embassies, particularly those in the Middle \nEast, were put on\u0014\n              heightened alert, as was the U.S. military in the \nregion. The cia was getting\u0014\n              vague reports \"of some kind of spectacular happenings\" \nby terrorists, said\u0014\n              a U.S. intelligence official, but the reports were \nvague as to timing. \"A lot of\u0014\n              this reporting we had in the summer that gained our \nattention and had us\u0014\n              concerned, but wasn't specific, could have been tied to \nthis,\" said a U.S.\u0014\n              intelligence official. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Even had they known more, could officials ever have \ncontemplated the\u0014\n              scale of this thing? The blasts were so powerful that \ncounterterrorism\u0014\n              teams have begun asking the airlines for fuel loads on \nthe plane; aviation\u0014\n              experts have been asked to calculate the explosive \nyield of each blastin\u0014\n              kiloton terms. The reason? Washington wants to see if \nthe planes\u0014\n              amounted to weapons of mass destruction. \"What we want \npeople to\u0014\n              realize is they've crossed a line here,\" said a U.S. \nintelligence official. In\u0014\n              fact, some senior Administration officials are \nconsidering drafting a\u0014\n              declaration of war, although the State Department is \nleery since nobody\u0014\n              knows precisely who the war would be against. By \ncontrast, as the day\u0014\n              unfolded, it looked awfully easy to declare war on us. \nThe attack was the\u0014\n              perfect mockery of the President's faith in missile \ndefense: What if the\u0014\n              missile is an American Airlines plane, and the pilot \nwants to kill you? It was\u0014\n              only eight years ago that a group of zealots led by \nRamzi Yousef tried to\u0014\n              take the towers down from the bottom, with a rented \nRyder truck full of\u0014\n              homemade explosives. Their goal, as an unsigned \nstatement presented\u0014\n              later at trial put it, was no less than toppling \"the \ntowers that constitute the\u0014\n              pillars of their civilization.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n              U.S. officials learned a great deal from that attempt, \nnotes retired atf\u0014\n              investigator Baughn. But the terrorists also learned. \n\"They learned that\u0014\n              they had to come at it from a different attitude,\" \nBaughn says. \"What\u0014\n              they've done today was the easiest thing they could do. \nThey didn't have\u0014\n              to bring in any explosives. They didn't have to put a \ngroup of people\u0014\n              together. They didn't have to go find a safe house. \nThey didn't have to go\u0014\n              construct anything. They didn't have to rent a truck. \nThey didn't have to\u0014\n              load the truck. They didn't have to drive it to some \nplace. All they had to do\u0014\n              was hijack an airplane.\" They made it look so easy, you \nwondered if the\u0014\n              only reason the U.S. has not seen a hijacking in 20 \nyears was because\u0014\n              hardly anyone was trying. It's a wonder why not; the \nMicrosoft flight\u0014\n              simulator and Fly! IIthe two most popular simulators \nfor personal\u0014\n              computersallow you to pretend to fly between the World \nTrade Center\u0014\n              towers, and into them. Anyone looking to practice can \nbuy the software off\u0014\n              the shelf.\u0014\n\u0014\n              At 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, with the pentagon still in \nflames, the congressional\u0014\n              leadership, with a crowd of Senators and Congressmen \nbehind them,\u0014\n              stood on the Capitol steps. \"When Americans suffer and \nwhen people\u0014\n              perpetrate acts against this country, we as a Congress \nand as a\u0014\n              government stand united, and stand together,\" said an \nangry Dennis\u0014\n              Hastert, Speaker of the House, with Democrat Dick \nGephardt standing\u0014\n              stony silent beside him. Both parties \"will stand \nshoulder to shoulder to\u0014\n              fight this evil,\" Hastert promised. He asked everyone \nto bow their heads in\u0014\n              a moment of silence. Afterward the Congressmen and \nSenators,\u0014\n              Republicans hugging Democrats, broke out into a chorus \nof God Bless\u0014\n              America.\u0014\n\u0014\n              As patriotism swelled, the day threatened to loop us \ninto the kinds of\u0014\n              barbaric blood feuds from which we've always been able \nto stay away. So\u0014\n              people lashed out, getting angry at our not very humble \nforeign policy,\u0014\n              complaining about a culture of ironic detachment that \nmade us unmoved\u0014\n              by a threat that was very real. (Though in the \nimmediate aftermath of the\u0014\n              attacks, pollsters found that by a huge proportion, \n80%, Americans were\u0014\n              ready to go to war, and prepared for the body bags that \ngo with it.)\u0014\n\u0014\n              Whatever the outcome, it was clear that some things had \nchanged forever.\u0014\n              The attacks will become a defining reference point for \nour culture and\u0014\n              imagination, a question of before and after, safe and \nscarred. By 10:30\u0014\n              Tuesday morning, four tourists from the Czech Republic \nwere at the\u0014\n              Empire State building, buying up all the postcards with \npictures of the\u0014\n              World Trade Center on them. \"Soon there will be no more \nof these cards\u0014\n              also,\" one explained. \u0014\n\u0014\n              When one world ended at 8:45 on Tuesday morning, \nanother was born,\u0014\n              one we always trust in but never see, in which normal \npeople become\u0014\n              fierce heroes and everyone takes a test for which they \nhaven't studied. As\u0014\n              President Bush said in his speech to the nation, we are \nleft with both a\u0014\n              terrible sadness and a quiet unyielding anger. He was \nwrong, though, to\u0014\n              talk of the steel of our resolve. Steel, we now know, \nbends and melts; we\u0014\n              need to be made of something stronger than that nownot \nexcluding an\u0014\n              unseasoned President new to his job. Do we now panic, \nor will we be\u0014\n              brave? Once the dump trucks and bulldozers have cleared \naway the\u0014\n              rubble and a thousand funeral Masses have been said, \nonce the streets\u0014\n              are swept clean of ash and glass and the stores and \nmonuments and\u0014\n              airports reopen, once we have begun to explain this to \nour children and to\u0014\n              ourselves, what will we do? What else but build new \ncathedrals, and if they\u0014\n              are bombed, build some more. Because the faith is in \nthe act of building,\u0014\n              not the building itself, and no amount of terror can \nkeep us from scraping\u0014\n              the sky.\u0014",

In the wake of September \n11, the West is learning that the\u0014\n                      answer to that question is anything but clear. \nReassuring to many Americans was the\u0014\n                      chorus of moderate Muslim voicesleaders of \npredominantly Muslim nations, heads of\u0014\n                      Islamic organizations around the \nworlddenouncing terror, violence, and intolerance\u0014\n                      as incompatible with the faith. But at the same \ntime, from the long Muslim \"street\"\u0014\n                      stretching from Rabat to Jakarta, there came a \ncontrary and deeply disturbing\u0014\n                      message. It said that the terrorists were \nrighteous warriors engaged in a holy war\u0014\n                      against the Great Satan. It said, too, that \nIslamtrue Islamwas locked in a struggle\u0014\n                      with the forces of Western modernism and \nsecularism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mixed signals abound.  Shortly after  \nPakistan's President  Pervez Musharraf\u0014\n                      condemned the skyjackers'  murderous assaults, \na  group of some 250\u0014\n                      businessmen in  Peshawar, not far  from the \nAfghan border, drove through their streets\u0014\n                      denouncing the terrorists for \"trying in effect \nto hijack Islam.\"\u0014\n                      But the prompt response of a group of religious \nscholars  there was to issue a religious \u0014\n                      verdict, or fatwa, enjoining Muslims to engage \nAmerican infidels in a holy war if they \u0014\n                      attacked Afghanistan. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even more confusing, Americans now learn, some \nof the seemingly moderate voices\u0014\n                      heard in the immediate aftermath of the \nattacksincluding heads of Muslim\u0014\n                      organizations and mosques in this countryhave \non other occasions voiced their\u0014\n                      approval of Muslim-inspired terrorist groups \nlike Hamas and Hezbollah. Some have also\u0014\n                      shown themselves to be less tolerant of that \nportion of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims\u0014\n                      who understand and practice their faith in ways \nthat differ from their own. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And if tolerance is the litmus test in \ndifferentiating extreme and moderate Islam, what\u0014\n                      are Americans to make of the fact that Saudi \nArabia, one of America's strongest allies,\u0014\n                      actively supports the spread of its own \nhomegrown brand of puritanical and intolerant\u0014\n                      Islam? From the madrasahs (religious schools) \nof Pakistan to the mosques of\u0014\n                      Indonesia to Islamic centers in Europe and the \nUnited States, that brand of Wahhabi\u0014\n                      Islam has challenged traditional, locally \ninflected, and usually broad-minded versions of\u0014\n                      the faith, spreading an intolerant religiosity \nthat can spawn violence in the name of\u0014\n                      holy war.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Murky picture. At the core of the West's \npuzzlement lies the most urgent question:\u0014\n                      How do the terrorists responsible for the \nSeptember 11 carnage fit into this murky\u0014\n                      picture? What has become clear, of course, is \nthat their actions cannot be justified\u0014\n                      according to the main currents of Islamic \nteaching and practice. Indeed, the beliefs that\u0014\n                      guide their actions are as much a corruption of \nthe spirit and law of their faith as those\u0014\n                      of radical Christian fundamentalists who bomb \nabortion clinics or those of Hindu\u0014\n                      fundamentalists who raze an ancient Muslim \nmosque. And while such beliefs do not\u0014\n                      necessarily lead to acts of violence and \nterror, it has become chillingly apparent that\u0014\n                      they can.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The question of Islam's character is being \ncontested nowhere more urgently than on\u0014\n                      Muslim soil, where moderates and extremists \ncompete for the hearts and minds of the\u0014\n                      faithful. Consider the case of Mohammad \nShahrour, 62, a Syrian civil engineer and\u0014\n                      author. Educated in Syria, the former Soviet \nUnion, and Ireland, Shahrour is a devout\u0014\n                      Muslim who has written four books arguing that \nthe sacred texts of Islam must be read\u0014\n                      and understood in relation to ever changing \nsocial realities. A radically modern or\u0014\n                      secular notion? Hardly. Shahrourlike many \nother moderatesinsists that that is what\u0014\n                      most traditional Muslims have been doing \nthroughout their 1,400-year history, whether\u0014\n                      in the Umayyad or Abbasid caliphates or the \nOttoman or Mughal empires. And they\u0014\n                      have done so in defiance of a narrow legalistic \nliteralism promoted by such medieval\u0014\n                      jurists as Ibn Taymiya (1263-1328) and \nsuccessive generations of Islamic\u0014\n                      fundamentalists who have claimed to purify the \nfaith. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Shahrour's books have sold tens of thousands of \ncopies, even circulating in countries\u0014\n                      where they are officially banned. But in the \nprocess they have earned him the enmity\u0014\n                      of a very large and vocal extremist opposition. \nSelf-styled defenders of the\u0014\n                      faithdescendants of the narrow legalistshave \ndenounced Shahrour's ideas as sinful\u0014\n                      \"innovations\" and characterized him and other \nmoderates as \"apostates.\" Such strong\u0014\n                      language has real consequences. It exposes \nShahrour and other moderates, both\u0014\n                      within and beyond the Islamic world, to \nharassment, censorship, and violence. Yet\u0014\n                      neither Shahrour nor other moderate voicesfrom \nAbdokarim Soroush, a moderate\u0014\n                      cleric in Iran, to Nazir Ahmad, a former \nmilitary officer in Pakistan, to Khaled Abou el\u0014\n                      Fadl, a professor of Islamic law at UCLAhave \nbeen silenced. Last year, for instance,\u0014\n                      in a debate aired on satellite television, \nShahrour took on the dean of the religion\u0014\n                      faculty of Cairo's Al-Azhar University, and he \nwill soon go on a speaking tour in\u0014\n                      Kuwait. \"More and more people are listening,\" \nShahrour says from his office in\u0014\n                      Damascus. And, he adds, \"The recent events will \nhelp me make my case stronger.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps. But the other side sounds just as \nconfident about winning the struggle within\u0014\n                      Islama struggle so fraught with implications \nthat scholars have begun to call it the\u0014\n                      \"Islamic Reformation.\" Like the conflict that \ndivided Christendom in the 16th century,\u0014\n                      this upheaval is as much political, economic, \nand cultural as it is religious. It has as\u0014\n                      much to do with the spread (albeit spotty) of \nliteracy and TV sets, the failures of\u0014\n                      corrupt and repressive political regimes, and a \ngrowing, generalized resentment of the\u0014\n                      West as it does with the application of \nreligious law to modern Muslim states. Dale\u0014\n                      Eickelman, an anthropologist at Dartmouth \nCollege, has been at the forefront of\u0014\n                      scholars studying the effects of mass education \nand communication on this\u0014\n                      reformation. Both, he says, have made it \npossible for unprecedented numbers of the\u0014\n                      faithful to examine and debate \"the \nfundamentals of Muslim belief and practice in ways\u0014\n                      that their . . . predecessors would never have \nimagined.\" Having observed village life\u0014\n                      in locales as far-flung as Morocco and Oman for \nclose to three decades, Eickelman\u0014\n                      has seen the young in recent years take the \nunprecedented step of challenging the\u0014\n                      faith of their elders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This new generation of Muslims, urban and \nrural, is troubling not only because it is\u0014\n                      armed with a little knowledge and too many \ncertainties. It is also troubling because it is\u0014\n                      large, restless, underemployedand so deeply \nsusceptible to the ideas put forth by\u0014\n                      radical Islamic groups. Called Islamists by \nscholars because of their subordination of\u0014\n                      spiritual concerns to political-legal ones, \nthese groups have been on the rise\u0014\n                      throughout the 20th century and include among \ntheir founding ideologues the Egyptian\u0014\n                      Sayyid Qutb, hanged in 1966 for allegedly \nplanning the assassination of President\u0014\n                      Gamal Abdel Nasser. Driven by hostility to the \nWestern institutions and ideals of their\u0014\n                      former European colonizers, they are equally \ncontemptuous of the autocratic regimes\u0014\n                      that arose after the colonial era, whether \nmonarchical, military, or nominally socialistic.\u0014\n                      And with the drying up of secular, often \nMarxist-inspired liberation movements after\u0014\n                      the collapse of Soviet communism, the Islamists \nhave become the main voices of\u0014\n                      political opposition in the Muslim world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      To be sure, important differences distinguish \nsuch groups as Algeria's Islamic\u0014\n                      Salvation Front and the Egypt-spawned (but now \nglobal) Muslim Brotherhood. Some\u0014\n                      are more militant and violent than others. Some \nenvision absolute theocracies, while\u0014\n                      others propose parliamentary Islamic republics \n(under strict religious guidance). But\u0014\n                      what unites them all, says British journalist \nMark Huband in Warriors of the Prophet:\u0014\n                      The Struggle for Islam, is their commitment to \n\"the introduction of the sharia as the\u0014\n                      sole source of law\" for the states they \npropose. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unsullied law. And that raises another crucial \nquestion: What is sharia? Literally\u0014\n                      translated as \"the way,\" the religious law of \nsharia has been in formation, and often\u0014\n                      under dispute, ever since the earliest \ncaliphates that followed the death of the prophet\u0014\n                      Mohammed in 632. To Sunni traditionalists (some \n85 percent of practicing Muslims),\u0014\n                      Islamic jurisprudence can be practiced in \naccordance with any one of four legal\u0014\n                      schools whose commentaries were completed by \nthe end of the 10th century. To the\u0014\n                      Shiite minority (who broke with the Sunni after \ntheir candidate for caliph, Ali, was killed\u0014\n                      in 661), the process of creative interpretation \nremains open; in fact, it comes under the\u0014\n                      responsibility of a hierarchical religious \nleadership that is absent in the Sunni tradition.\u0014\n                      (Sunni jurists, or muftis, are said only to \napply the law, not to interpret it, though\u0014\n                      application can be a creative process.) And the \nsmall but widely influential Sufi\u0014\n                      movement, a mystical and philosophical \ntradition that emerged within Islam in the eighth\u0014\n                      century, takes a far more relaxed view of \nsharia. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the salient feature of the Islamists is \ntheir proposal, reminiscent of such puritan\u0014\n                      extremists as Ibn Taymiya and the more recent \n18th-century firebrand Muhammad ibn\u0014\n                      Abd al-Wahhab (1703-92), to restore pure \nreligious law as formulated by the Prophet\u0014\n                      and enforced by him and the first three \n\"Rightfully Guided\" caliphs. That unsullied law\u0014\n                      is contained, they say, in the Koran and the \nHadith (the sayings and doings of the\u0014\n                      Prophet). In fact, says UCLA's Abou el Fadl, \nwhat they do is blur the distinction\u0014\n                      between the \"branches\" of the law (practices \nsuch as the veiling of women, which\u0014\n                      are historically contingent and subject to \ndebate) and the foundations of the law\u0014\n                      (which, like the first pillar of faith's belief \nin Allah as the only one true God, are beyond\u0014\n                      debate). They insist, says Abou el Fadl, \"that \nif we go back to the original Koran and\u0014\n                      Hadith, 95 percent of all issues will be \ndecided.\" And believing that, he adds, the\u0014\n                      Islamists \"wave away all that rich dialectical \ntradition of law.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even more threatening to traditionalist \nMuslims, the puritan fundamentalists say that\u0014\n                      those who cling to what they deem unacceptable \ntraditions or practices (such as the\u0014\n                      veneration of Muslim saints) are guilty of \n\"innovation,\" an error which, if not\u0014\n                      renounced, will lead to apostasy. And just as \nthey insist that they are the only true\u0014\n                      way of Islama determination that both the \nKoran and the Hadith say only Allah can\u0014\n                      makethese extremists ignore the lessons of \nIslamic history (and even the example of\u0014\n                      the Islamic Republic of Iran) in their \ninsistence that secular laws and institutions cannot\u0014\n                      coexist with sharia.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Utopian aim. What all this amounts to, says \nAbdul Hadi Palazzi, secretary-general of\u0014\n                      the Italian Muslim Association, is a utopian \nand totalitarian movementand in that sense,\u0014\n                      very much a modern \"-ism.\" The goal of \nIslamism, Palazzi notes, is total power for a\u0014\n                      centralized religious authority, a goal that \ncontradicts decentralized Sunni traditions.\u0014\n                      And the Islamists' utopian claim to purity \nimplies what Palazzi calls \"a wholesale denial\u0014\n                      of history.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Utopian it is. But like other dangerous utopian \nideologies of this century, this one has\u0014\n                      found followers and wealthy sponsorsnone more \nwealthy than the religious\u0014\n                      establishment of Saudi Arabia. The royal family \nof Saudi Arabia has, in fact, found\u0014\n                      itself involved in a delicate and dangerous \ndance. It funds that establishment with a\u0014\n                      generous portion of its huge oil revenues. \nSaud-family ties to Wahhabism date from\u0014\n                      the late 18th century, when the Wahhabi \ncritique of the Ottoman sultanate comported\u0014\n                      well with the Sauds' struggle against their \nOttoman overlords. But since the formation\u0014\n                      of the kingdom in 1932, that relationship has \ngrown problematic: Simply put, many true\u0014\n                      believers within the Wahhabi fold threaten to \nturn against the oil-rich regime that\u0014\n                      supports them. Or supports them to a point. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Osama bin Laden, whose family has close ties to \nthe royal family, is not the only Saudi\u0014\n                      to be banished from the homeland for carrying \nhis beliefs too far. \"They hate religion,\"\u0014\n                      Khaled al-Fauwaz, London representative of the \nSaudi Islamist Advice and\u0014\n                      Reformation Committee (ARC), told journalist \nHuband, expressing the view of many\u0014\n                      Wahhabi Islamists who consider the royal family \nimpious, in great measure because it\u0014\n                      allows American bases to remain in the same \ncountry as Islam's sacred sites. Though\u0014\n                      he broke with bin Laden, a founder of the ARC, \nin 1996, al-Fauwaz hopes to achieve\u0014\n                      similar ends through different means, including \ncharitable work. \"Our aim is to break\u0014\n                      the international support for the al-Saud,\" he \nsaid. \"But I am not very optimistic. And\u0014\n                      Americans can only leave after bloodshed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But many Wahhabi purists remain within Saudi \nArabia, working in organizations such\u0014\n                      as the Muslim World League that aggressively \nspread the puritan creed throughout the\u0014\n                      world. Not only do the league and other \norganizations support religious institutions,\u0014\n                      schools, and mosques abroad; one of their \nobjectives is to oppose diversity within\u0014\n                      Islam by repelling what the league on its own \nWeb site calls \"inimical trends and dogma\u0014\n                      which the enemies of Islam seek to exploit in \norder to destroy the unity of Muslims. . . .\"\u0014\n                      The Saudi role in funding the Pakistani \nmadrasahs that spawned the Taliban is now\u0014\n                      widely recognized. Each year, these \nschoolssome 10,000 of themreturn thousands\u0014\n                      of their graduates not only to Pakistan and \nAfghanistan but to the former Soviet states\u0014\n                      of Central Asia as well as to Malaysia, \nThailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Saudis\u0014\n                      also bring young foreign Muslims to the \nkingdom, giving them fellowships to learn\u0014\n                      Arabic and the true ways of the faith. Returned \nto their homelands, all of these\u0014\n                      beneficiaries of Saudi largess promote \nWahhabi-style Islam in mosques, schools, and\u0014\n                      charitable organizations. Less well known, some \nMuslim leaders claim, Wahhabi\u0014\n                      money and influence permeate many Muslim \norganizations and mosques in Western\u0014\n                      Europe and North America, even though studies \nhave shown that most American\u0014\n                      mosques eschew radical or literalist Islam. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, a professor of political \nscience at the University of San Diego,\u0014\n                      made an even blunter charge in a speech \ndelivered in Washington last year: \"The\u0014\n                      rogue states [such as Iraq and Libya] are,\" he \nsaid, \"less important in the radicalization\u0014\n                      of Islam than Saudi Arabia.\" Asked recently by \nU.S. News to elaborate, he explained,\u0014\n                      \"Until now, Saudi Arabia has said to the United \nStates that what it does for the Muslim\u0014\n                      world is none of its business. But the \nunintended consequences [of Saudi actions] are\u0014\n                      now being visited upon the United States. We \nnow know where the ideological fervor\u0014\n                      is coming from.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But what can America do in this struggle within \nIslam, beyond urging the Saud family\u0014\n                      to beware of what it sows? Quite clearly, \nAmerica needs to combat Islamist\u0014\n                      propaganda about its role in the Middle East, \nparticularly its caricature of U.S. dealings\u0014\n                      with Israel and the Palestinians. Additionally, \nAmerica can and should encourage Saudi\u0014\n                      Arabia and other allies in the Islamic world to \ntruly liberalize their regimeseven at the\u0014\n                      risk of alienating some of the major suppliers \nof U.S. oil by doing so. And certainly, it is\u0014\n                      in America's interests to support the voices of \nmoderation engaged in Islam's\u0014\n                      momentous culture war. What will it take to \naccomplish all of this? To begin with, a\u0014\n                      broader knowledge of the languages and \ntraditions of a great civilization than we have\u0014\n                      previously attempted to acquire.\u0014",

    "words": "DANGER LIES IN IGNORANCE OF POSTMODERNISM\u0014\n                                                     Michael Foust\u0014\n\u0014\n    Should Christians be concerned about postmodernism? For that \nmatter, what is postmodernism?  That question is tackled in the \nsummer 2001 edition of \"The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology,\" \nwhich is published by Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.  The \njournal's writers argue that postmodernism--the belief that there is \nno absolute truth and that all individuals construct their own \nmeaning --poses a great threat to the Christian church. \nPostmodernists generally believe that all religions are equal and \nthat morality is relative. In the lead editorial, Southern Seminary \nprofessor Thomas Schreiner argues that postmodernism must not be \navoided.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We must note immediately ...the danger that lurks when we choose to \nneglect a deviant philosophy, especially when the philosophy is \ngaining ground in the culture,\" writes Schreiner, professsor of New \nTestament. \"We may piously claim to be preaching the Gospel, while in \nfact we are in the process of being co-opted by the very philosophy \nthat we have supposedly avoided. Our ignorance may become the \nplatform by which we are subverted.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNoting that everyone is influenced by the culture, Schreiner points \nout that many orthodox [or traditional] Christian beliefs were \ndefined when the early church had to answer various heresies. \"A \npastor who knows nothing about heresy probably has a very shallow \nunderstanding of orthodoxy,\" Schreiner writes. \"Those who are in the \ndark about postmodernism may find them- selves clutched by its \ntentacles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCountering those who may say they are too busy to study \npostmodernism, Schreiner contends that it is not necessary to be an \nexpert on the issue. He says that postmodern beliefs will be \nencountered in daily contact with non- Christians and Christians \nalike. \"We offer this very issue of the journal. ..to assist pastors \nin grasping the basic elements of the postmodern world view,\" he \nwrites. \"We must not say that pastors have to be experts in \npostmodernism to understand it. We can, nevertheless, have a \nreasonably good grasp of many arenas of life without being experts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTed Cabal, professor of philosophy at Southern, points out that \npostmodernism and orthodox Christianity cannot co-exist. For \nstarters, Cabal writes, postmoderns believe that the reader \ndetermines the meaning of a book. That cannot be the case with the \nBible. \"The meaning of the text of Scripture cannot be regarded as \nindeterminate and endlessly open to word play,\" he writes. \"Preaching \nthe exclusivity in Jesus, though offensive to postmoderns, is a \nnon-negotiable for His followers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Parker, Southern Seminary's professor and associate dean of \nworld-view and culture, argues that postmodernism will eventually die \nbecause it is an inconsistent philosophical system. \"When one has \ngiven up the idea of normative, universal, and absolute truth, there \nis no reason whatsoever to take what he says as true [particularly \nsince he has conceded up front that 'truth' does not even exist],\" he \nwrites about postmodernism's defenders.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillard Erickson, who teaches theology at George W. Truett \nTheological Seminary, asserts that a view of absolute truth is a \nfoundation of evangelism. \"Evangelism, and orthodox Christianity in \ngeneral, has always contended that its assertions about God are \nactually affirming truths about His nature and actions, and that its \nhistorical assertions refer to actual occurrences,\" he writes.\u0014",

    "title": "SECONDARY TRAUMTIC STRESS",
    "words": "Diane M. Langberg, Ph.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo walk alongside a survivor of trauma is to be touched by that \ntrauma. We do not have to be the direct recipient of a trauma in \norder to be traumatized. Entering into relationship with someone who \nhas been traumatized can Diane langberg have a profound impact on us. \nAll of us have had the experience of listening to the story of \nanother' s suffering and feeling overwhelmed, wanting them to stop \nbecause we feel we cannot han- dle hearing anymore. Those who enter \ninto the trauma of others can find themselves experiencing \nsleeplessness, nightmares, intrusive images, anxiety, numbing, and \nirri- tability. In addition, trauma can challenge one's faith, lead \nto pessimism and a height- ened feeling of vulnerability to disaster. \nThe latter is something we all felt in response to the attack on \nSeptember 11. These are the same symptoms that a trauma survivor \ndevelops. In essence, trauma can be conta- gious.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me suggest a few strategies that will help you endure should you \nfind yourself called to enter into the trauma of others' lives. \nFirst, know yourself. Know your strengths, your weaknesses, your \nlimitations, and your resources. You will unable to care for \nyourself, admit need, or know when to stop if you do not know \nyourself.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, set limits. You will not be able to endure if you do not \nprotect yourself from being utterly overwhelmed. The person you \ndesire to help needs you to last and that means you must know when \nyou must stop and find renewal so you can come back and continue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, know God and his word. One of the effects of trauma is that it \nleads us to doubt God. We think perhaps he is not sovereign or is not \ngood. Unless you steep yourself in the truths of the Word of God you \nwill lose your grounding and find your beliefs about the character of \nGod determined by circum- stances rather than Scripture. Unless you \nsearch out God's Word you will lose sight of the beauty that is in \nJesus and only see the tragedy, anguish, and evil of trauma. Entrance \ninto the trauma of others is some- times a foray into hell and you \nwill not survive such a journey outside of the grace and power of \nJesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, maintain close connections with others who know and love \nChrist. You will need to worship regularly, pray with others, and \nhear them pray for you. You will need to have relationships with \npeople who under- stand what you do and who can remind you that there \nis more to life than trauma. You will need people who can help you \nlaugh as well as those who will weep with you. You will also need \npeople who know you well and have the courage to tell you when they \nthink you have lost your perspective or when you think you are \nindispensable.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, be a student of trauma. If you are to be effective with those \nwho have experienced trauma such as sexual abuse, domestic vio- \nlence, or the attack on the World Trade\u0014\nCenter, you need to understand the nature of trauma and how it \naffects human beings. If you do not understand such things you will \nmake wrong and hurtful responses to those who are already suffering. \nReading a book such as Judith Herman's Trauma and Recovery, a classic \non the nature of trauma, would be very helpful.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, rely on the Spirit of God about what to do and say. If you \ndo not know how to rely on him, you will resort to formulas and book \nknowledge. It is he who under- stands the heart and mind of the \nindividual with whom you are working. Knowledge and techniques are \nimportant but wisdom comes from God. Develop an ear that is trained \nto hear from God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe live in an uncertain world. There are many kinds of trauma \naffecting us and the people around us. The church is called by God to \nenter into the suffering of others. We cannot do so effectively \nunless we under- stand trauma, its affect on us as helpers, and\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of these ideas were taken from the book, Counseling Survivors of \nSexual Abuse, by Diane Mandt Langberg (Tyndale House Publishers, \nInc., 1997).\u0014",

The jury\u0014\n              apparently believed the sex might have been consensual, \nbut\u0014\n              among the things the judge did not permit jurors to \nknow was\u0014\n              that Dr. Darwish had already been convicted of having \nsex\u0014\n              with patients under similar circumstances nine times. \n[London\u0014\n              Daily Telegraph, 10-10-01] \u0014\n\u0014\n               In July, Dr. Richard Dye of Half Moon Bay, Calif., was\u0014\n              acquitted of sexual assault on female patients despite \nhis\u0014\n              admission that he had therapeutically brought at least \nfour\u0014\n              women to climax on his examination table during his \nyears as\u0014\n              a family practitioner.

Still, on the eve of the\u0014\n               multimedia reunion known as The Beatles\u0014\n               Anthology, George Harrison granted\u0014\n               NEWSWEEK an interview, on the condition that it\u0014\n               be conducted by fax. A tricky way to interview\u0014\n               someone, it turns out. Particularly someone well\u0014\n               known for his elusiveness and his wit. Harrison\u0014\n               was asked, When you see McCartney and/or\u0014\n               Starr these days, do you hug or shake hands?\u0014\n               And he faxed back, Yes. But asked if retelling the\u0014\n               bands story for the Anthology was healing or\u0014\n               boring or neither, Harrison became more\u0014\n               expansive: The upside of the Beatles was always\u0014\n               far bigger than the downside, and it was good to\u0014\n               remember that. In reality, the Beatles exist apart\u0014\n               from my Self. I am not really Beatle George.\u0014\n               Beatle George is like a suit or shirt that I once\u0014\n               wore on occasion and until the end of my life\u0014\n               people may see that shirt and mistake it for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nHARRISON, 58, DIED of cancer on Nov. 29 at a friends\u0014\n                         home in Los Angeles, having spent the last \nfew years\u0014\n                         urging his fans not to worry about himand \nto love each\u0014\n                         othereven as the disease attacked his \nthroat, his lungs\u0014\n                         and finally his brain. His wife, Olivia, was \nwith him, as was\u0014\n                         their son, Dhani, 24. The family issued a \nstatement that\u0014\n                         read, in part, He left this world as he \nlived in it,\u0014\n                         conscious of God, fearless of death, and at \npeace,\u0014\n                         surrounded by family and friends. After the \nbreakup of\u0014\n                         the Beatles, John Lennon, whose wit was \nsimilar to\u0014\n                         Harrisons, if more savage, said, George \nhas not done\u0014\n                         his best work yet. His talents have \ndeveloped over the\u0014\n                         years and he was working with two fking \nbrilliant\u0014\n                         songwriters, and he learned a lot from us. I \nwouldnt have\u0014\n                         minded being George, the invisible man, and \nlearning\u0014\n                         what he learned. Maybe it was hard for him \nsometimes\u0014\n                         because Paul and I are such egomaniacs, but \nthats the\u0014\n                         game. Theres truth to what Lennon said, \nbut he\u0014\n                         seemed not to realize how profound his \nfriends quests\u0014\n                         were going to be. What Harrison wanted to \nlearn, Lennon\u0014\n                         and McCartney could never teach him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Harrison was a 15-year-old in \nLiverpool when he joined John and\u0014\n                         Pauls group, the Quarry Men, as a \nguitarist. Lennon thought the kid\u0014\n                         was too young to have around but ultimately \nlet  him in the band because\u0014\n                         he knew a lot of chords. Even as a Beatle,  \nHarrison had to prove  himself. He had to write\u0014\n                         Somethingone of the most famous love \nsongs in historyjust to get on\u0014\n                         the A side of a single. (Frank Sinatra sang \nit hundreds of\u0014\n                         times in concertand always credited it to \nLennon and\u0014\n                         McCartney.) Harrison, of course, also \nintroduced pop\u0014\n                         music to the sitar on Norwegian Wood, and \npenned\u0014\n                         While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Here \nComes the\u0014\n                         Sun, which came to him all of a piece in \nEric Claptons\u0014\n                         garden. Still, his songs kept getting \nelbowed off Beatles\u0014\n                         albums. The guitarists first release after \nthe breakup, the\u0014\n                         fitfully brilliant All Things Must Pass, \nwas three records\u0014\n                         long: that was Harrisons creativity \nextending its middle\u0014\n                         finger. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                In 1971, Harrison organized the \nConcert for\u0014\n                         Bangladesh, the prototype for Live Aid, as \nwell as a\u0014\n                         statement about the place Eastern music and \nreligion\u0014\n                         held in his heart. Everybody from Led \nZeppelin to\u0014\n                         Madonna has since sewn Indian motifs into \ntheir music,\u0014\n                         so it may be difficult to imagine a time \nwhen audiences\u0014\n                         were less spiritual. On the Bangladesh \nalbum, Ravi\u0014\n                         Shankars group floats a flourish of tones, \nthe crowd\u0014\n                         applauds and then Shankar says, Thank you. \nIf you\u0014\n                         appreciate the tuning so much, I hope youll \nenjoy the\u0014\n                         playing more. As a solo artist, Harrison \ncontinued to\u0014\n                         write gorgeous, beseeching songs on \noccasion, but the\u0014\n                         you that he sang to was no longer a lover \nbut God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  George Harrisons Lifelong Luck\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 As the decades piled up, Harrison \nproduced Monty\u0014\n                         Pythons Life of Brian, obsessed over auto \nracing,\u0014\n                         gardened with a passion. His life seemed \nlike an\u0014\n                         eccentric enterprise from afar, but thats \nwhat it was\u0014\n                         meant to be: his life, not a Beatles life. \nIn 1999, a\u0014\n                         deranged heroin addict broke into Harrisons \nOxfordshire\u0014\n                         mansion and, its said, would have stabbed \nthe singer to\u0014\n                         death had Harrison not grabbed the point of \nthe knife\u0014\n                         with his palm. Youd think that nearly \nlosing Harrison then\u0014\n                         would have prepared us for this. If only it \nhad. I am\u0014\n                         devastated, McCartney said last week. He \nwas a lovely\u0014\n                         guy and very brave and had a wonderful sense \nof humor.\u0014\n                         He really is just my baby brother. Its a \nbleak day for us\u0014\n                         too. Here comes a cloud. There goes the sun.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                                 2001 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

He agreed and several months later came back \nwith his findings. Indeed it was a blue blood family except for one \ngreat-grandfather who had been hanged for horse stealing. The lady \nsaid, Oh, my goodness! This just won't do. In my family? The ladies \nin the historical society would never let me forget it.  I need you \nto change that in some way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe researcher said, Lady, I'm sorry, but my work stands on its own \nmerits.  I am a man of integrity, and the work I do is honest. I \ncannot do what you're asking.  She said, Oh, but I just can't have \nthis.  I'll give you $5,000 to change this information.  He said, \nI'm sorry, m'am, but I couldn't live with my conscience and do \nthat.  She insisted all the more vigorously and finally said, All \nright, I've give you $20,000 to do something with this.  He thought: \n$20,000? and said, Well, I can't promise anything, but I will \ntry.  He set a time to return.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he came back, the lady was very anxious to see what he had done \nto help salvage her family name.

Our word salary comes from the word \nsalt because in Roman times, wages were paid in salt. \u0014\n\tIn biblical times, salt also had a symbolic meaning. When people \nmade a contract or agreement they made it over a meal with salt. This \n\"covenant of salt\" was a covenant of friendship. Salt was also \noffered with all animal sacrifices. To be like salt is therefore to \nbe crucial to the world. \u0014\n\tAs salt, the disciples are what seasons and preserves life; they are \nthe signs of covenant and friendship between peoples.

From that seed the following spring\u0014\n                  would sprout a legendary creature who would one\u0014\n                  day transcend the Sport of Kings and forever alter\u0014\n                  the course of racing history. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  But the harsh winds of 30 winters have since\u0014\n                  eroded this hallowed ground that once nurtured\u0014\n                  the immortal Secretariat. The pastures and\u0014\n                  training track that once shook from the pounding\u0014\n                  of \"Big Red's\" mighty hooves have been still for\u0014\n                  two decades. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Only 400 of the farm's original 2,000 acres are as\u0014\n                  they were then. The training track and adjoining \nbarns have remained somewhat\u0014\n                  intact, but are decaying with every passing year. \nThere are no longer horses frolicking\u0014\n                  about or even photographs on an office wall to keep \nthe memories alive. All that\u0014\n                  remains in Caroline County to remind one of The \nMeadow's illustrious past are the\u0014\n                  aging, but still-fertile, minds of several former \ngrooms, to whom those glory days of\u0014\n                  the 1950s, '60s, and '70s have all but faded from \ntheir minds. They have moved on\u0014\n                  with their lives--two work full-time as janitors, \ntwo have retired, and one dabbles as a\u0014\n                  handyman, occasionally doing lawn work and fixing \nsmall engines and lawn\u0014\n                  mowers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Charlie Ross, 66, passes The Meadow every day to \nand from his job at the All\u0014\n                  American Truck Plaza, just off Interstate 95, \ndirectly across from King's Dominion\u0014\n                  amusement park. Ross has been employed there as a \njanitor for the past eight\u0014\n                  years. For someone who worked at The Meadow for 37 \nyears, taking care of some of\u0014\n                  the best-bred yearlings in the country, Ross \nadmits, \"It was strange at first going from\u0014\n                  the horses to cleaning showers.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  One of the yearlings who was turned over to him in \nthe early spring of 1971 was a\u0014\n                  powerful chestnut colt by Bold Ruler, out of \nSomethingroyal, who had already been\u0014\n                  given the name Secretariat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Ross spent nearly a year grooming Secretariat, \nwatching him trim off pounds of baby\u0014\n                  fat and develop into a racehorse and eventually \ninto a legend. But the big chestnut\u0014\n                  with the three white legs and long, elegant strip \nof white running down his face was\u0014\n                  but one of many horses to pass Ross' way. Although \nhe does admit to feeling good\u0014\n                  about his role in Secretariat's life, in the world \nof Charlie Ross, there is not much\u0014\n                  room for sentimentality. His only personal link to \nSecretariat these days is a copy of\u0014\n                  Ray Woolfe Jr.'s book, which tells Big Red's story \nin text and photos. Any other pieces\u0014\n                  of memorabilia collected over the years are long \ngone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  On the afternoon of Dec. 20, 2001, Ross left work \nat the usual time of 3 o'clock, got\u0014\n                  into his 1999 metallic blue Toyota pickup, and \nheaded east on two-lane Route 30\u0014\n                  toward his home on nearby Sadie Lane. But today was \ndifferent. Instead of driving\u0014\n                  past the dirt road entrance of The Meadow's old \ntraining complex, Ross hung a right\u0014\n                  and drove along the outside of the track to an \nopening in the rail. On the other side of\u0014\n                  the track was the indoor training barn and the \nEuropean-style stable area, with the\u0014\n                  three outdoor barns forming three sides of a \nsquare. The fourth side, completing the\u0014\n                  square, was a large open shed, in which still stood \nthe old hotwalking machine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Ross looked at the peeling paint of the training \nbarn that was now more gray than\u0014\n                  white and just shook his head. \"It's been a lot of \nyears since I've been here,\" he said.\u0014\n                  \"It feels strange to be back. There was a time when \nI used to be here more than I\u0014\n                  was at home. There sure was no paint peeling off \nback then like it is now. We used\u0014\n                  to paint it every year. This was a beautiful place \nto work, and Mr. (Christopher)\u0014\n                  Chenery was a wonderful man to work for. So was \nMrs. Tweedy (Chenery's daughter\u0014\n                  Penny, who took over the farm after her father's \ndeath in 1972).\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Ross, who has a noticeable limp due to arthritis, \nwalked alongside one of the barns,\u0014\n                  passing one stall after another. When he came to \nthe end, he unhooked the top door\u0014\n                  of the first stall and said, as if he were \nunveiling a priceless work of art, \"This was\u0014\n                  Secretariat's stall.\" Inside, several of the \nceiling boards had come loose and were\u0014\n                  split and rotted. In the back left corner hung a \nveil of cobwebs, and in the front left\u0014\n                  corner stood an old broom. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Ross just stared inside, then took a few steps \nforward and rested his arms atop the\u0014\n                  bottom stall door. Although he said nothing, one \ncouldn't help but imagine the flood\u0014\n                  of memories that were rushing through his mind. \n\"See these two holes,\" he said,\u0014\n                  pointing to a pair of nail holes in the open top \ndoor. \"This is where I hung the plaque\u0014\n                  that read: 'Secretariat, by Bold Ruler out of \nSomethingroyal.' Yeeeaaah, it does bring\u0014\n                  back memories. I remember when I used to stand \noutside this stall in the sunshine,\u0014\n                  just as I am now. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I got Secretariat in the spring, along with five \nother yearlings, and I remember liking\u0014\n                  him when I first saw him. He was built real strong, \nand because he was so big and\u0014\n                  powerful, it took him a while to get it together. \nHe was a very quiet horse to work with\u0014\n                  and I didn't have any problems with him. He had no \nbad habits; no biting, no kicking\u0014\n                  or anything like that. Meredith Bailes used to ride \nhim a lot and he thought he might\u0014\n                  be something, but he really never showed anything \nto make us believe he was\u0014\n                  gonna become such a great horse.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Ross recalled going to the Preakness on a rented \nbus with other farm employees.\u0014\n                  He also attended the Belmont Stakes with his wife, \nbut was blocked by the huge\u0014\n                  crowd and had to watch the historic event on a TV \nmonitor in the clubhouse. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As Ross returned to his truck, he seemed to be \nengulfed by the quiet, as the only\u0014\n                  sound came from the winter winds howling through \nthe naked tree limbs. \"Yeah, I\u0014\n                  made a lot of tracks around this old place,\" he \nsaid. \"But there's nothin' around here\u0014\n                  no more. It's really sad. I still think about \nSecretariat now and then, especially when I\u0014\n                  watch the races on television. But I have another \njob now, and as long as I'm\u0014\n                  working, I'm happy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Just up the road from Ross' house is the home of \n66-year-old Bannie Mines, who\u0014\n                  along with Howard Gregory and Lewis Tillman, took \ncare of Secretariat when he was\u0014\n                  a foal and weanling. Tillman died several years \nago, but Mines and Gregory are still\u0014\n                  going strong. Mines lives in a small house on Riva \nRidge Road with his daughter\u0014\n                  and grandson, for whom he babysits while his \ndaughter is at work. A few doors down\u0014\n                  lives Raymond \"Peter Blue\" Goodall, who was Riva \nRidge's groom when he was a\u0014\n                  yearling. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory lives several minutes away, across Route \n30, on Gregory Road. One of his\u0014\n                  neighbors is 74-year-old Wilbur \"Bill\" Street, who \nspent most of his time at the track,\u0014\n                  but did team up with his brother Harry to van \nSecretariat from the farm to Hialeah in\u0014\n                  January of 1972 to start his racing career. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Mines says he doesn't do much else other than some \nyard work and watching\u0014\n                  television. Gregory, although 76, is still sharp \nand loves to keep busy, mowing lawns,\u0014\n                  doing a little landscaping, and fixing engines.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Meadow Farm Grooms (Cont.)\u0014\n                  by Steve Haskin\u0014\n                  Date Posted: 1/15/02 3:50:30 PM\u0014\n                  Last Updated: 1/15/02 3:50:30 PM\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory worked at The Meadow for 31 years and \nanother several years after Penny\u0014\n                  Chenery sold the farm. Of the next two owners of \nThe Meadow, also known as\u0014\n                  Meadow Farm, one went bankrupt and the other went \nto prison. The current owner\u0014\n                  tore down the original house and built a new one \nacross the road from the old\u0014\n                  training complex. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory was around Secretariat from the day he was \nborn, which was March 30,\u0014\n                  1970, at 10 minutes past midnight. Dr. Olive Britt, \nThe Meadow's veterinarian who still\u0014\n                  practices part-time at age 83, remembers getting a \ncall from the nightwatchman,\u0014\n                  telling her that Somethingroyal was in the middle \nof foaling. By the time she arrived,\u0014\n                  Somethingroyal had already given birth. Britt, who \nnow lives in nearby Goochland\u0014\n                  County, said she'll never forget farm manager \nHoward Gentry watching the foal get to\u0014\n                  his feet and saying, \"This is what we've been \nwaiting for for 35 years.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory could tell right away the colt was \nsomething special. \"We knew from the\u0014\n                  get-go he was different from any horse we ever \nhad,\" he said. \"There was definitely\u0014\n                  something there. I remember him being very alert, \nand he'd test you. When you\u0014\n                  walked him to the paddock your mind and his had to \ncorrespond. If he thought you\u0014\n                  weren't paying attention he was gone. You had to \nhave your mind focused on him at\u0014\n                  all times. I also worked with Riva Ridge and he was \nan altogether different horse. He\u0014\n                  was so quiet, and all you had to do was say, 'Whoa, \nRiva,' and he'd just stop and\u0014\n                  stand there. But Secretariat would try you in a \nheartbeat. You had to know what you\u0014\n                  were doing, because he always knew when you had him \nand when you didn't. And if\u0014\n                  he knew you didn't, that was it; he was gone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"He was a gorgeous colt, with a beautiful head, and \nthose three white stockings. I'll\u0014\n                  never forget watching the Belmont Stakes on TV. \nLord, that was something to see.\u0014\n                  I'm very proud to have been around a horse like \nthat. I remember putting his mother,\u0014\n                  Somethingroyal, in the ground after she died at age \n31. I also buried Hill Prince.\u0014\n                  Those were really special days back then, and you \ncouldn't work for anyone nicer\u0014\n                  than Mr. Chenery. Money was never a problem, and we \ngot bonuses and shares in\u0014\n                  winnings. I was available anytime they needed me, \nbecause I loved what I was doing\u0014\n                  and where I was working. When I wanted to build my \nown house, they helped me out.\u0014\n                  And because of Mr. Chenery, I live in a six-room \nhouse on five acres, and it's all mine.\u0014\n                  There aren't many people out there like Mr. Chenery \nanymore. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I stayed on after Mrs. Tweedy sold the farm, but \nthe last fellow I worked for, Mr. (Eric)\u0014\n                  Friedlander, couldn't pay us, so I left. I drive by \nthe farm most every day, shopping and\u0014\n                  doing errands, but I go right by. I haven't been \nback since the day I left. It hurts me too\u0014\n                  bad to see what's become of it. I've had several \njobs since, but I'm pretty much retired\u0014\n                  now. I thank God I'm still around to do whatever I \nwant to. I couldn't ask for more than\u0014\n                  that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory, like Ross, has little in the way of \nmemorabilia from the old days, and no\u0014\n                  longer sees much of his fellow workers. \"I used to \nhave all kinds of stuff, but where\u0014\n                  they are I couldn't put my finger on it,\" he said. \n\"It's been so long. I very seldom get a\u0014\n                  chance to visit with the other guys. Everybody's \npretty much gone on their own now.\u0014\n                  Every once in a while I run acrosss one of 'em, but \nnot too often.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Gregory actually lives only five or six minutes \nfrom Riva Ridge Road, and was able to\u0014\n                  point out Bannie Mines' house before heading to \nRichmond to do some errands.\u0014\n                  Mines, who is Charlie Ross' brother-in-law, is an \namiable fellow with white hair, who\u0014\n                  cordially welcomed a stranger into his home. While \nhis memory is not nearly as\u0014\n                  sharp as Gregory's, and he has a problem hearing, \nhe did try to pull out whatever\u0014\n                  remnants of the old days his memory could muster. \nMines worked at The Meadow for\u0014\n                  25 years, mainly in the broodmare barn and helping \nout with the yearlings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I remember Secretariat was a big, strong colt; \nbigger than the others, and very well\u0014\n                  built,\" he recalled. \"With the weanlings, we always \ntried to put the three best horses\u0014\n                  together, and the best horse would go into the \nfirst stall. I remember Secretariat was\u0014\n                  put in the first stall, so everyone must have felt \nhe was the best. He gave you an idea\u0014\n                  even then that he might turn into something. It \nmade me feel real good to see him\u0014\n                  become such a great horse. He was pretty easy to \nwork with, but he had a temper,\u0014\n                  too. I had him for about a year, and then he went \nto Charlie.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Mines continued on after the farm was sold, then \nwent to work at another farm before\u0014\n                  retiring. \"I don't do much these days, just rake a \nlittle leaves and cut a little grass,\" he\u0014\n                  said. \"I watch TV most of the time. I don't have \nany souvenirs, but I did have a picture\u0014\n                  of Hill Prince. I think it's out back in the shed \nsomewhere.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Mines then went out to his backyard and opened the \ndoor to his shed. He had to step\u0014\n                  over several large objects to get to the back wall, \nand there, hanging in a glassless\u0014\n                  frame, was a finish and winner's circle photo of \nHill Prince, yellowed by the years.\u0014\n                  Mines removed the photo from the frame and showed \noff his only link to the old days.\u0014\n                  \"I really do miss those days,\" he said. \"But I left \nafter the last people took over and I've\u0014\n                  never been back.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Riva Ridge Road and Sadie Lane comprise the \nsettlement known as Duval Town,\u0014\n                  which was originally built after emancipation to \nhouse freed slaves. It was there that\u0014\n                  the majority of grooms lived. Each morning, the \nfarm truck would make its rounds\u0014\n                  through Duval Town, picking up the grooms and \nbringing them to work. Sadie Lane\u0014\n                  was named by the county after the matriarch of the \nextended family that lived there.\u0014\n                  Known as \"Aunt Sarah\" or \"Aunt Sadie,\" she cooked \nfor Penny Chenery's mother in\u0014\n                  the 1940s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"I remember Raymond Goodall's mother, Magnolia, \nworked in the house, along with\u0014\n                  her sister,\" Penny Chenery recalled. \"And they were \ndaughters of Aunt Sadie. They\u0014\n                  were all great people. The grooms were all in their \n30s during the heyday of the '70s.\u0014\n                  Whenever we won a big race, we gave them a week's \npay. They were wonderful to\u0014\n                  me. I clearly was not my father, but they were \nrespectful and helpful as I was learning\u0014\n                  on the job. It was just a wonderful team.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  And they came up with a wonderful horse, believed \nby many to be the greatest of all\u0014\n                  time. There are only faint memories left for The \nMeadow's grooms. But Howard\u0014\n                  Gregory's eyes still light up when he thinks of the \nchestnut foal who would one day\u0014\n                  grow up to be Big Red. He rolled the images around \nin his mind for a few seconds\u0014\n                  before the words made their way out: \"A horse like \nSecretariat. That will never happen\u0014\n                  no more.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                              Copyright  2002 The Blood-Horse, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\u0014",

    "words": "Subject: Sounds familiar\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is an actual letter sent to a bank in the United States. The bank\u0014\nthought it amusing enough to publish it in the New York Times.\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Sir:\u0014\n\u0014\nI am writing to thank you for bouncing the check with which I \nendeavored\u0014\nto pay my plumber last month. By my calculations some three \nnanoseconds\u0014\nmust have elapsed between his presenting the check, and the arrival in\u0014\nmy account of the funds needed to honor it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire\u0014\nsalary, an arrangement which, I admit, has only been in place for \neight\u0014\nyears.  You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of\u0014\nopportunity, and also for debiting my account with $50 by way of\u0014\npenalty, for the inconvenience I caused to your bank.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has\u0014\ncaused me to rethink my errant financial ways.  You have set me on the\u0014\npath of fiscal righteousness. No more will our relationship be \nblighted\u0014\nby these unpleasant incidents, for I am restructuring my affairs in\u0014\n2001, taking as my model the procedures, attitudes and conduct of your\u0014\nvery bank. I can think of no greater compliment, and I know you will \nbe\u0014\nexcited and proud to hear it.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo this end, please be advised about the following changes. I have\u0014\nnoticed that whereas I personally attend to your telephone calls and\u0014\nletters, when I try to contact you I am confronted by the impersonal,\u0014\never-changing, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has \nbecome.\u0014\n\u0014\n>From now on I, like you, choose only to deal with a flesh and blood\u0014\nperson.  My mortgage and loan repayments will, therefore and \nhereafter,\u0014\nno longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by check,\u0014\naddressed personally and confidentially to an employee of your branch,\u0014\nwhom you must nominate.  You will be aware that it is an offense under\u0014\nthe Postal Act for any other person to open such an envelope.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlease find attached an Application for Authorized Contact Status, \nwhich\u0014\nI require your chosen employee to complete. I am sorry it runs to \neight\u0014\npages, but in order that I know as much about him or her as your bank\u0014\nknows about me, there is no alternative.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlease note that all copies of his or her medical history must be\u0014\ncountersigned by a Justice of the Peace, and that the mandatory \ndetails\u0014\nof his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities)\u0014\nmust be accompanied by documented proof.  In due course I will issue\u0014\nyour employee a PIN number which he/she must quote in all dealings \nwith\u0014\nme. I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I \nhave\u0014\nmodeled it on the number of button presses required to access my \naccount\u0014\nbalance on your phone bank service. As they say, imitation is the\u0014\nsincerest form of flattery.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me level the playing field even further by introducing you to my \nnew\u0014\ntelephone system, which you will notice, is very much like yours.  My\u0014\nAuthorized Contact at your bank, the only person with whom I will have\u0014\nany dealings, may call me at any time and will be answered by an\u0014\nautomated voice. Press buttons as follows:\u0014\n1) To make an appointment to see me\u0014\n2) To query a missing payment\u0014\n3) To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there\u0014\n4) To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping\u0014\n5) To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature\u0014\n6) To transfer the call to my mobile phone in case I am not at home\u0014\n7) To leave a message on my computer [to leave a message a password to\u0014\naccess my computer is required: password will be communicated at a \nlater\u0014\ndate to the Authorized Contact]\u0014\n8) To return to the main menu and listen carefully to options 1 \nthrough\u0014\n7\u0014\n9) To make a general complaint or inquiry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Authorized Contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention\u0014\nof my automated answering service. While this may on occasion involve \na\u0014\nlengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration.  This month\u0014\nI've chosen a refrain from \"The Best of Woody Guthrie\": Oh, the banks\u0014\nare made of marble, With a guard at every door, And the vaults are\u0014\nfilled with silver, that the miners sweated for.\"  After twenty \nminutes\u0014\nof that, our mutual Contact will probably know it by heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a more serious note, we come to the matter of cost.  As your bank \nhas\u0014\noften pointed out, the ongoing drive for greater efficiency comes at a\u0014\ncost, a cost which you have always been quick to pass on to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me repay your kindness by passing some costs back. First, there is\u0014\nthe matter of advertising material you send me. This I will read for a\u0014\nfee of $20 per page. Inquiries from your Authorized Contact will be\u0014\nbilled at $5 per minute of my time spent in = response. Any debits to \nmy\u0014\naccount, as, for example, in the matter of the penalty for the\u0014\ndishonored check, will be passed back to you.   My new phone service\u0014\nruns at 75 cents a minute (even Woody Guthrie doesn't come for free), \nso\u0014\nyou would be well advised to keep your inquiries brief and to the\u0014\npoint.  Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also \nlevy\u0014\nan establishment fee of 2% of my balance or $50 (whichever is more) to\u0014\ncover the setting up of this new arrangement.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay I wish you a happy, if ever-so-slightly less prosperous, New Year.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour humble client\u0014\n\u0014\nThank You\u0014",

    "title": "SKETCHES OF CHURCH HISTORY - WORSHIP - PART 1& 2",
    "words": "Sketches of Church History\u0014\n\n                                                                                     \nCHRISTIAN WORSHIP \u0014\n\u0014\nPART I\u0014\n \u0014\nIn the early days of the Gospel, while the Christians were generally \npoor, and when they were obliged to meet in fear of the heathen, \ntheir worship was held in private houses and sometimes in \nburial-places under-ground. But after a time buildings were expressly \nset apart for worship. It has been mentioned that in the years of \nquiet, between the death of Valerian and the last persecution (A D. \n261-303) these churches were built much more handsomely than before, \nand were furnished with gold and silver plate and other rich \nornaments (page 32). And after the conversion of Constantine, they \nbecame still finer and costlier. The clergy then wore rich dresses at \nservice, the music was less simple and the ceremonies were \nmultiplied. Some of the old heathen temples were turned into \nchurches, but temples were not built in a shape very suitable for \nChristian worship and the pattern of the new churches was rather \ntaken from the halls of justice, called \"Basilicas\", which were to be \nfound in every large town. These buildings were of an oblong shape, \nwith a broad middle part, and on each side of it an aisle, separated \nfrom it by a row of pillars. This lower part of the basilica was used \nby merchants who met to talk about their business, and by all sorts \nof loungers who met to tell and hear the news. But at the upper end \nof the oblong there was a half circle, with its floor raised above \nthe level of the rest; and in the middle of this part the judge of \nthe city sat. Now if you will compare this description with the plan \nof a church, you will see that the broad middle part of the basilica \nanswers to what is called the \"body\" or \"nave\" of the church; that \nthe side aisles are alike in each; and that the further part of the \nbasilica, with its raised floor, answers to the \"chancel\" of a \nchurch; while the holy table, or \"altar\", stands in the place \nanswering to the judge's seat in the basilica. Same of these halls \nwere given up by the emperors to be turned into churches, and the \nplan of them was found convenient as a pattern in the building of new \nchurches. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn entering a church, the first part was the Porch, in which there \nwere places for the catechumens (that is to say, those who were \npreparing for baptism); for those who were supposed to be possessed \nwith devils, and who were under the care of the exorcists (page 81), \nand for the lowest kinds of those who were undergoing penance. Beyond \nthis porch were the \"Beautiful Gates\", which opened into the \"Nave\" \nof the church. Just within these gates were those penitents whose \ntime of penance was nearly ended; and the rest of the nave was the \nplace for the \"faithful\"--that is to say, for those who were admitted \nto all the privileges of Christians. At the upper end of the nave, a \nplace called the \"Choir\" was railed in for the singers; and then, \nlast of all, came the raised part or \"chancel\", which has been spoken \nof. This was called the \"Sanctuary\", and was set apart for the clergy \nonly. The women sat in church apart from the men; sometimes they were \nin the aisles, and sometimes in galleries. Churches generally had a \ncourt in front of them or about them, in which were the lodgings of \nthe clergy, and a building for the administration of baptism, called \nthe \"Baptistery\". \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early times, churches were not adorned with pictures or \nstatues; for Christians were at first afraid to have any ornaments of \nthe kind, lest they should fall into idolatry like the heathen. No \nsuch things as images or pictures of our Lord, or of His saints, were \nknown among them; and in their every-day life, instead of the figures \nof gods, with which the heathens used to adorn their houses, their \nfurniture, their cups, and their seals, the Christians made use of \nemblems only. Thus, instead of pretending to make a likeness of our \nLord's human form, they made a figure of a shepherd carrying a lamb \non his shoulders, to signify the Good Shepherd who gave his life for \nhis sheep (St. John x. 11). Other ornaments of the same kind were--a \ndove signifying the Holy Ghost, a ship, signifying the Church, the \nark of salvation, sailing towards heaven; a fish, which was meant to \nremind them of their having been born again in the water at their \nbaptism; a musical instrument called a lyre, to signify Christian \njoy; and an anchor, the figure of Christian hope. About the year 300, \nthe Council of Elvira, in Spain, made a canon forbidding pictures in \nchurch, which shows that the practice had then begun, and was \ngrowing; and also that, in Spain, at least, it was thought to be \ndangerous (as indeed it too surely proved to be). And a hundred years \nlater, Epiphanius, a famous bishop of Salamis, in the island of \nCyprus, tore a curtain which he found hanging in a church, with a \nfigure of our Lord, or of some saint, painted on it. He declared that \nsuch things were altogether unlawful, and desired that the curtain \nmight be used to bury some poor man in, promising to send the church \na plain one instead of it. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristians used to sign themselves with the sign of the cross on many \noccasions, and figures of the cross were early set up in churches. \nBut crucifixes (which are figures of our Lord on the cross, although \nignorant people sometimes call the cross itself a crucifix) were not \nknown until hundreds of years after the time of which we are now \nspeaking.\u0014\n\u0014\nPART II \u0014\n\u0014\nThe church-service of Christians was always the same as to its main \nparts, although there were little differences as to order and the \nlike. Justin Martyr, who lived (as we have seen) about the middle of \nthe second century (see Chapter III), describes the service as it was \nin his time. It began, he says, with readings from the Scriptures; \nthen followed a discourse by the chief clergyman who was present; and \nthere was much singing, of which a part was from the Old Testament \npsalms, while a part was made up of hymns on Christian subjects. The \ndiscourses of the clergy were generally meant to explain the \nScripture lessons which had been read. At first these discourses were \nvery plain, and as much as possible like ordinary talk; and from this \nthey got the name of \"homilies\", which properly meant nothing more \nthan \"conversations\". But by degrees they grew to be more like \nspeeches, and people used to flock to them, just as many do now, from \na wish to hear something fine, rather than with any notion of taking \nthe preacher's words to heart, and trying to be made better by them. \nAnd in the fourth century, when a clergyman preached eloquently, the \npeople used to cheer him on by clapping their hands, waving their \nhandkerchiefs, and shouting out, \"Orthodox!\" \"Thirteenth apostle!\" or \nother such cries. Good men, of course, did not like to be treated in \nthis way, as if they were actors at a theatre; and we often find St. \nChrysostom and St Augustine (of both of whom you will hear by-and-by; \nobjecting to it in their sermons, and begging their hearers not to \nshow their admiration in such foolish and unseemly ways. But it seems \nthat the people went on with it nevertheless; and no doubt there must \nhave been some preachers who were vain enough and silly enough to be \npleased with it. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the time of the Apostles the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was \ncelebrated in the evening, as it had been by our blessed Lord Himself \non the night in which He was betrayed. Thus it was, for instance, \nwhen the disciples at Troas \"came together upon the first day of the \nweek (Sunday) to break bread\" (that is, to celebrate the Lord's \nSupper), and \"Paul preached unto them, and continued his speech until \nmidnight\" (Acts xx. 7). In the service for this sacrament there was a \nthanksgiving to God for His bounty in bestowing the fruits of the \nearth. The congregation offered gifts of bread and wine, and from \nthese the elements which were to be consecrated were taken. They also \nbrought gifts of money, which was used for the relief of the poor, \nfor the support of the clergy, and for other good and religious \npurposes. Either before or after the sacrament, there was a meal \ncalled the love-feast, for which all the members of the congregation \nbrought provisions, according as they could afford. All of them sat \ndown to it as equals, in token of their being alike in Christ's \nBrotherhood; and it ended with psalm-singing and prayer. But even in \nvery early days (as St. Paul shows us in his first epistle to the \nCorinthians, xi. 21f), there was sad misbehaviour at these meals; and \nbesides this, such religious feasts gave the heathen an excuse for \ntheir stories that the Christians met to feed on human flesh and to \ncommit other abominations in secret (see page 7). For these reasons, \nafter a time, the love-feast was separated from the holy Communion, \nand at length it was entirely given up. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second century, the administration of the Lord's Supper, \ninstead of being in the evening as at first, was added on to the \nmorning service, and then a difference was made between the two parts \nof the service. At the earlier part of it the catechumens and \npenitents might be present, but when the Communion office was going \nto begin, a deacon called out, \"Let no one of the catechumens or of \nthe hearers stay.\" After this none were allowed to remain except \nthose who were entitled to communicate, which all baptized Christians \ndid in those days, unless they were shut out from the Church on \naccount of their misdeeds. The \"breaking of bread\" in the Lord's \nSupper was at first daily, as we know from the early chapters of the \nActs (ii. 46); but this practice does not seem to have lasted beyond \nthe time when the faith of the Christians was in its first warmth, \nand it became usual to celebrate the holy Communion on the Lord's day \nonly. When Christianity became the religion of the empire, and there \nwas now no fear of persecution, the earlier part of the service was \nopen not only to catechumens and penitents, but to Jews and heathens; \nand in the fifth century, when the Church was mostly made up of \npersons who had been baptized and trained in Christianity from \ninfancy, the distinction between the \"service of the catechumens\" and \nthe \"service of the faithful\" was no longer kept up. \u0014\nThe length of time during which converts were obliged to be \ncatechumens before being admitted to baptism differed in different \nparts of the Church. In some places it was two years, in some three \nyears; but if during this time they fell sick and appeared to be in \ndanger of death, they were baptized without waiting any longer. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt baptism, those who received it professed their faith, or their \nsponsors did so for them, and from this began the use of creeds, \ncontaining, in few words, the chief articles of the Christian faith. \nThe sign of the cross was made over those who were baptized \"in token \nthat they should not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ \ncrucified, and manfully to fight under His banner against sin, the \nworld, and the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful soldiers and \nservants unto their life's end.\" The kiss of peace was given to them \nin token of their being taken into spiritual brotherhood; white robes \nwere put on them, to signify their cleansing from sin; and a mixture \nof milk and honey was administered to them, as if to give them a \nforetaste of their heavenly inheritance, of which the earthly Canaan, \n\"flowing with milk and honey\" (Exod. iii. 8, etc.) had been a figure. \nOther ceremonies were added in the fourth century, such as the use of \nsalt and lights, and an anointing with oil in token of their being \n\"made kings and priests to God\" (Rev. i. 6; 1 Pet. ii. 5-9), besides \nthe anointing with a mixture called \"chrism\" at confirmation, which \nhad been practised in earlier times. \u0014\nThe usual time of baptism was the season from Easter-eve to \nWhitsuntide; but in case of danger, persons might be baptized at any \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nPART III \u0014\nDuring the fourth century there was a growth of superstitions and \ncorruptions in the Church. Great numbers of converts came into it, \nbringing their old heathen notions with them, and not well knowing \nwhat they might expect, but with an eager desire to find as much to \ninterest them in the worship and life of Christians as they had found \nin the ceremonies and shows of their former religion. And in order \nthat such converts might not be altogether disappointed, the \nChristian teachers of the age allowed a number of things which soon \nbegan to have very bad effects; thus, as we are told in the preface \nto our own Prayer-book, St. Augustine complained that in his time \n(which was about the year 400) ceremonies \"were grown to such a \nnumber that the estate of Christian people was in worse case \nconcerning that matter than were the Jews.\" Among the corruptions \nwhich were now growing, although they did not come to a head until \nafterwards, one was an excess of reverence for saints, which led to \nthe practices of making addresses to them, and of paying \nsuperstitious honours to their dead bodies. Another corruption was \nthe improper use of paintings or images, which even in St. \nAugustine's time had gone so far that, as he owns with sorrow, many \nof the ignorant were \"worshippers of pictures.\" Another was the \nfashion of going on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, in which \nConstantine's mother, Helena, set an example which was soon followed \nby thousands, who not only fancied that the sight of the places \nhallowed by the great events of Scripture would kindle or heighten \ntheir devotion, but that prayers would be especially pleasing to God \nif they were offered up in such places. And thus great numbers \nflocked to Palestine from all quarters, and even from Britain, among \nother countries, and on their return they carried back with them \nwater from the Jordan, earth from the Redeemer's sepulchre, or what \nthey believed to be chips of the true cross, which was supposed to \nhave been found during Helena's visit to Jerusalem. The mischiefs of \nthis fashion soon showed themselves. St. Basil's brother, Gregory of \nNyssa, wrote a little book expressly for the purpose of persuading \npeople not to go on pilgrimage. He said that he himself had been \nneither better nor worse for a visit which he had paid to the Holy \nLand; but that such a pilgrimage might even be dangerous for others \nbecause the inhabitants of the country were so vicious that there was \nmore likelihood of getting harm from them than good from the sight of \nthe holy places. \"We should rather try,\" he said, \"to go out of the \nbody than to drag it about from place to place.\" Another very learned \nman of the same time, St. Jerome, although he had taken up his own \nabode at Bethlehem, saw so much of the evils which arose from \npilgrimages that he gave very earnest warnings against them. \"It is \nno praise,\" he says, \"to have been at Jerusalem but to have lived \nreligiously at Jerusalem. The sight of the places where our Lord died \nand rose again are profitable to those who bear their own cross and \ndaily rise again with Him. But for those who say, 'The temple of the \nLord, the temple of the Lord,' (Jerem. vii. 4), let them hear the \nApostle's words, 'Ye are the temple of God and the Spirit of God \ndwelleth in you,' (1 Cor. iii. 16) The court of heaven is open to \napproach from Jerusalem and from Britain alike; 'for the kingdom of \nGod is within you'\" (St. Luke xvii. 21). \u0014\nThere were, indeed, some persons who rose up to oppose the errors of \nwhich I have been speaking. But unhappily they mixed up the truths \nwhich they wished to teach with so many errors of their own, and they \ncarried on their opposition so unwisely, that, instead of doing good, \nthey did harm, by setting people against such truth as they taught on \naccount of the error which was joined with it, and of the strong way \nwhich they took of teaching it. By such opposition the growth of \nsuperstition was not checked, but advanced and strengthened.\u0014",

I am a 32-year-old female. My home is at No. \n18 of Hangyu Dongzhen in Xinye County, Nangyann, Henan. I was \nsentenced to two years in prison because I believe in God.\u0014\nAt about ten oclock in the evening on March 22, 2001, I was getting \nready to go to bed. Suddenly Li Bin, assistant director of Xinye \npolice station, climbed over the wall surrounding my house and broke \nin.\u0014\n\u0014\nLi Bin forced me to give him the key to my father-in-laws house. Li \nopened the door and searched that house also. The police did not find \nanything except a set of cassettes of praising songs and a hardcover, \nGod, Youre Great, in the back room.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Li Bin got me into their car and took me to the Hang Yun \npolice station, Xinye County. During my jail time in Xinhang police \nstation, Li Bin interrogated me five times. He used electric shock on \nme, and pinched my fingers and back with pliers. I lost consciousness \nseveral times because of the pain. Li Bin tried to force me to admit \nthat I worshiped God. I kept silent all the time so they couldnt get \nanything from me. Then Li Bin sent me to Xinye County detention house.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the detention house, I am exhausted every day, and I dont get \nenough to eat. In the morning we are given a small bowl of thin \nnoodles and hard, steamed bread, and in the evening we only get a \nbowl of thin noodles, which we call tigers diarrhea.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 19, Xinye County police sentenced me to be in prison for two \nyears for associating with cults and breaking the laws. Li Bin and \nLiyanpu handcuffed me and took me to Shibali Womens LaborEducation \nCenter of Zhangzhou, where I have been ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014",

Again, the cardinal \napologized\u0014\n                         and, according to people familiar with the \nsituation, turned\u0014\n                         over to state authorities the names of \nbetween 60 and 70\u0014\n                         priests who had been accused of abusing \nchildren over the\u0014\n                         past 40 yearsreversing his own longstanding \npolicy of\u0014\n                         handling such allegations quietly, within \nthe church.

The church reacted as \ninstitutions\u0014\n                         often doas Enron didand that is to deny, \nto delay, to\u0014\n                         dissemble, to fool themselves into thinking \nthat all was\u0014\n                         well, says Eugene Kennedy, a former priest \nand author of\u0014\n                         The Unhealed Wound: The Church and Human \nSexuality.\u0014\n                                 The soul-searching goes well beyond \nBoston, to an\u0014\n                         American Catholic hierarchy suddenly facing \nthe same kind\u0014\n                         of recriminations over long-buried episodes \nof sexual\u0014\n                         abuse that in recent years have shaken other \nAmerican\u0014\n                         institutionsincluding schools, sports \nteams, Boy Scouts\u0014\n                         and, most commonly, families. Following \nLaws lead,\u0014\n                         bishops in Manchester, N.H., and Portland, \nMaine, have\u0014\n                         agreed to turn over the names of alleged \noffenders to the\u0014\n                         authorities. On Friday the Archdiocese of \nPhiladelphia said\u0014\n                         it had found credible evidence that 35 \npriests sexually\u0014\n                         abused children over five decades and that \nit had relieved\u0014\n                         several of them of their duties. Last week \nthe Arizona Daily\u0014\n                         Star called for the resignation of Bishop \nManuel D. Moreno\u0014\n                         of Tucson, after the disclosure that church \nofficials had\u0014\n                         quietly paid millions of dollars in \nrestitution to nine former\u0014\n                         altar boys. Plaintiffs attorneys say \ntheyre receiving calls\u0014\n                         daily from victims in Maryland, New York, \nCalifornia, Iowa,\u0014\n                         Arizona and Illinois. To some civil \nlibertarians, the\u0014\n                         avalanche of allegations calls to mind the \nday-care witch\u0014\n                         hunts of the 1980s. Were in an atmosphere \nnow where\u0014\n                         theres a substantial chance of accusations \nagainst, even\u0014\n                         conviction of, an innocent priest, says \nHarvey Silverglate,\u0014\n                         a board member of the American Civil \nLiberties Union of\u0014\n                         Massachusetts. The problem with witch hunts \nis that\u0014\n                         everybody accused is suddenly found guilty.\u0014\n                                 How many other Father Geoghans are \nstill serving in\u0014\n                         parishes, instructing altar boys and making \npastoral visits\u0014\n                         to families? Thats a question for which \nstatistics simply\u0014\n                         dont exist. We dont really know that much \nabout the\u0014\n                         sexuality of priests, period, says Dr. John \nBradford, head\u0014\n                         of the Sexual Behaviors Clinic at the Royal \nOttawa\u0014\n                         Hospital. The cases the church is grappling \nwith now\u0014\n                         involve two phenomena that are \npsychologically distinct but\u0014\n                         often are lumped together for legal and moral\u0014\n                         consideration: pedophilia, defined as \nintense and recurrent\u0014\n                         sexual desire for prepubescent children; and \nsexual\u0014\n                         advances on sexually mature, but underage, \nboys and\u0014\n                         girls. The latter, troubling as it is, is \npart of the human\u0014\n                         condition; priests have always been in a \nstruggle to keep\u0014\n                         their vows. Pedophilia, which researchers \nadmit they know\u0014\n                         little about, is believed to afflict 5 to 6 \npercent of all men\u0014\n                         (and hardly any women). Of these, most never \nact on\u0014\n                         these impulses. After a sex scandal in the \nearly 1990s, the\u0014\n                         Chicago archdiocese opened up records for \nall 2,252\u0014\n                         priests who served there over a period of 40 \nyears. Only\u0014\n                         one of the priests had allegedly assaulted a \npreteen. The\u0014\n                         most common complaints involved boys who \nwere 15 or 16.\u0014\n                         But some researchers think the priesthood \nmay hold a\u0014\n                         dangerous attraction for pedophilesnot \nbecause of the\u0014\n                         opportunities it presents to indulge their \nfantasies, but for\u0014\n                         the opposite reason, that they hope it can \nhelp control\u0014\n                         them. A very small percentage of pedophiles \nmay go into\u0014\n                         the priesthood thinking that celibacy will \nsolve the problem\u0014\n                         theyre dealing with, says Dr. Frederick \nBerlin, a\u0014\n                         psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins who deals with \nsexual\u0014\n                         disorders. \u0014\nKennedy, the former priest, has another theory: the\u0014\n                         church offers a comforting home to young men \nwho are\u0014\n                         psychologically and sexually immature. \nPriests gravitate\u0014\n                         toward male children because theyre male \nchildren\u0014\n                         themselves, he says. These men were \npromoted in the\u0014\n                         seminary because they were good boys... \nThere was an\u0014\n                         inevitability for their erotic targets to \nbecome children.\u0014\n                         Geoghan fits that profile exactly. When he \nwas a young\u0014\n                         seminarian in Boston, the rector wrote that \ndespite a very\u0014\n                         fervent spiritual life, the 18-year-old \nGeoghan had a very\u0014\n                         pronounced immaturity.\u0014\n                                 Of course, priests have no monopoly \non child abuse;\u0014\n                         by coincidence, just a day before Geoghans \nsentencing,\u0014\n                         police in New York arrested the cantor of \nthe countrys\u0014\n                         most prominent Reform synagogue, Temple \nEmanu-El,\u0014\n                         charging him with abusing his own 3-year-old \nnephew. He\u0014\n                         maintains his innocence. But clergymen have \nunique\u0014\n                         access to young people. Anthony Muzzi Jr., a \n47-year-old\u0014\n                         construction worker with a broad South \nBoston accent,\u0014\n                         remembers Geoghan as the beloved family \npriest and a\u0014\n                         frequent guest for dinner at his home. He \nwas among\u0014\n                         Geoghans first victims, beginning in the \n1960s, when\u0014\n                         Muzzi was 13 or 14, he says. He would \nmake friends like\u0014\n                         you cant believe. People loved this guy, \nMuzzi recalls. At\u0014\n                         night, he says, Geoghan would bless the \nchildren in their\u0014\n                         beds, sometimes whispering strange things as \nhe fondled\u0014\n                         them. He made it from me to my brother to \nmy cousin next\u0014\n                         door to another cousin, Muzzi charges. None \nof the boys\u0014\n                         said a word. Knowing what I know now, you \nfeel\u0014\n                         embarrassed and stupid, he says. How did I \nlet this\u0014\n                         happen? I wouldnt let a bus driver do this \nto me, so how\u0014\n                         did I let this priest do it?\u0014\n                                 And to be attacked by a priest is a \ndouble betrayal;\u0014\n                         the victims harbor the outrage and shattered \ninnocence of\u0014\n                         a child abused by a parent. Mark Keane, 32, \nsays he was\u0014\n                         raped by Geoghan when he was 14 in the \nchanging room\u0014\n                         of a Boston-area boys-and-girls club. He \ndidnt know the\u0014\n                         identity of his attacker, who was naked. But \nseveral weeks\u0014\n                         later he saw the man again, this time in \npriests robes.\u0014\n                         Thats when he cried. It really is a rape \nof your soul, he\u0014\n                         says. It is not just physical abuse, its a \nbetrayal of your\u0014\n                         faith. Its the most damaging thing \nimaginable. I cant have\u0014\n                         faith now, and if I wanted to, I have no \nplace to turn.\u0014\n                                 The anger among Bostons 2 million \nCatholics was\u0014\n                         stoked by the reams of documentation \nunsealed by the\u0014\n                         courtsafter journalists fought to see it. \nTo a woman who\u0014\n                         said her nephew was molested by Geoghan, Law \nwrote in\u0014\n                         September 1984: The matter of your concern \nis being\u0014\n                         investigated and appropriate pastoral \ndecisions will be\u0014\n                         made. But to Geoghan, he wrote in 1989: I \nam confident\u0014\n                         that you will again render fine priestly \nservice to the people\u0014\n                         of God in Saint Julia Parish. To Geoghan \nagain, in 1996,\u0014\n                         after approving his retirement status: \nYours has been an\u0014\n                         effective life of ministry, sadly impaired \nby illness... God\u0014\n                         bless you, Jack. These polite missives seem \nto confirm\u0014\n                         peoples worst fears: that the see-no-evil \nculture of the\u0014\n                         church is so entrenched, and the \nunwillingness of some\u0014\n                         priests to look honestly at themselves and \ntheir colleagues\u0014\n                         is so pervasive, that even the most \ncompassionate people\u0014\n                         can fail to protect those theyve vowed to \nserve.\u0014\n                                 Is the failure of the church to \nconfront the problem of\u0014\n                         sex abuse bred in its bonesan inclination \nto see neglect\u0014\n                         or violence as sin instead of crime and \ntherefore\u0014\n                         respond with prayer instead of punishment? \nPerhaps. But\u0014\n                         secrecy and silence have always \ncharacterized the\u0014\n                         Catholic Church, and in many of these cases \nthe church\u0014\n                         does all it can to prevent the charges from \ncoming to\u0014\n                         lightsometimes to the point of writing \nthreatening letters\u0014\n                         to outspoken priests, or advocating that \nincriminating\u0014\n                         documents be shipped out of U.S. \njurisdiction. The vast\u0014\n                         majority of these cases are settled outside \ncourt, and most\u0014\n                         settlements come with gag orders. In court \ncases, the\u0014\n                         church often moves to seal all the \nfileseven though in\u0014\n                         cases against secular child molesters, \nusually only the\u0014\n                         victims name and identity are concealed. A \nspokesman for\u0014\n                         the Archdiocese of Boston says victims \nfamilies often\u0014\n                         preferred discretion because they were \nloyal Catholics,\u0014\n                         and because they loved the church.

In 1984, the story of \nFather Gilbert\u0014\n                         Gauthe, a child-abusing priest in Louisiana, \nexploded into\u0014\n                         the national press. The same year Cardinal \nLaw moved\u0014\n                         Geoghan from St. Brendans to St. Julias.\u0014\n                                 Two years later, in response to the \nGauthe debacle,\u0014\n                         the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, \na loosely\u0014\n                         organized group that recommends policy for \nthe American\u0014\n                         church, held a conference on the sex abuse \nof minors.\u0014\n                         Father Thomas Doyle, then a canon lawyer in \nWashington,\u0014\n                         had been investigating the problem. What he \nconcluded\u0014\n                         was staggering: at the present rate, he \nestimated,\u0014\n                         child-sexual-abuse settlements would cost \nthe church $1\u0014\n                         billion over the following 10 years. The \nLinkup, a\u0014\n                         Chicago-based organization for victims of \nclerical sexual\u0014\n                         abuse, claims the church has, in fact, paid \nout at least\u0014\n                         $800 million since the 1980sa figure hotly \ndisputed by\u0014\n                         Mark Chopko, general counsel for the U.S. \nConference of\u0014\n                         Catholic Bishops, who puts the real number \nat somewhere\u0014\n                         closer to $250 [million] to $300 million... \nits still a whole lot\u0014\n                         of money, he adds. We advised, urged, \nbanged our\u0014\n                         heads against the wall, recalls Doyle, now \nan Air Force\u0014\n                         chaplain based in Germany. We advised that \nthe public\u0014\n                         be dealt with honestly and openly. The \nbishops conference\u0014\n                         rejected the whole report and everything \nthat was in it.\u0014\n                         Months later Patrick McSorley went for ice \ncream with\u0014\n                         Father Geoghan.\u0014\n                                 In 1993, another molesting priest \nmade national\u0014\n                         headlinesthis time a lot closer to home. \nFather James\u0014\n                         Porter was convicted of sexually abusing 28 \nchildren in the\u0014\n                         Diocese of Fall River, just 50 miles from \nBoston, and was\u0014\n                         sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison. This \ntime Law\u0014\n                         jumped into action. He put together a panel \nof experts to\u0014\n                         establish a formal policy, and invited all \nthe parish priests\u0014\n                         for their input. He published the policy, \nwhich was basically\u0014\n                         procedural guidelines, and gave a copy to \neach priest.\u0014\n                         Allegations were still handled in- house; \nnowhere did the\u0014\n                         policy advise turning abusers over to civil \nauthorities. The\u0014\n                         local presss obsession with the Porter case \nsent the\u0014\n                         cardinal around the bend, and he went after \nthe Globe with\u0014\n                         a holy wrath. By all means, we call down \nGods power on\u0014\n                         the media, particularly the Globe, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                          By 1995, a \ntreatment\u0014\n                                                  center had advised \nthat\u0014\n                                                  Geoghan should \nhave no\u0014\n                                                  interpersonal \ncontact with\u0014\n                                                  male minors that is\u0014\n                                                  unsupervised. For \nthe\u0014\n                                                  next several years, \nbarred\u0014\n                                                  from parish work, he\u0014\n                                                  moved among\u0014\n                         rehabilitation centers and retirement homes \nas the charges\u0014\n                         mounted against him. And he kept racking up \nvictims,\u0014\n                         charges Mitchell Garabedian, who represents \n118 people\u0014\n                         suing Geoghan, including McSorley. Finally, \naround the\u0014\n                         time the diocese paid $10 million to \nGeoghans accusers,\u0014\n                         Law took extraordinary action. He flew to \nRome and asked\u0014\n                         that the priest be relieved of his collar. \nDefrocking is\u0014\n                         usually a long judicial process, with room \nfor appeal, but\u0014\n                         Law made sure in this case it was \nirrevocable. He told the\u0014\n                         press in the summer of 1998 that as long as \nI am\u0014\n                         archbishop, I will be haunted by those \npersons who have\u0014\n                         been victimized.\u0014\n                                 Early last year, as criminal cases \nagainst Geoghan\u0014\n                         moved through the courts, reporters in \nBoston began\u0014\n                         sniffing around the story in earnest, \npublishing reports that\u0014\n                         the cardinal knew of Geoghans behavior. In \nthe diocesan\u0014\n                         newspaper last summer, the cardinal denied \nit: Never was\u0014\n                         there an effort on my part to shift a \nproblem from one place\u0014\n                         to the next, he wrote. In the fall the \nGlobe filed a motion to\u0014\n                         unseal the documents in the case and the \narchdiocese\u0014\n                         appealed. The Globe prevailed, and the \napologizing\u0014\n                         began.\u0014\n                                 Laws own culpability lies in what \nknew means. He\u0014\n                         has said publicly that although he was aware \nof Geoghans\u0014\n                         behavior, he genuinely believed in those \ndays that such a\u0014\n                         priest could be helped with therapy and \nrehabilitation. His\u0014\n                         belief was reinforced by the doctors \nassigned to examine\u0014\n                         Geoghanalthough they were not experts in \nthe field,\u0014\n                         critics say. The cardinals allies support \nthis view. He\u0014\n                         made his decision in a place and at a time \nwhen he\u0014\n                         thought it was the very best thing to do, \nsays Father\u0014\n                         Patrick Farrell, pastor at St. Peters \nCathedral in Jackson,\u0014\n                         Miss., and one of the cardinals oldest \nfriends. I could\u0014\n                         never imagine that man doing anything other \nthan have\u0014\n                         the deepest interest of the child at heart. \nDonna\u0014\n                         Morrissey, spokesperson for the Boston \narchdiocese,\u0014\n                         agrees, characterizing the cardinal as \ngenerous and\u0014\n                         kind.\u0014\n                                 Disaffected Catholics usually are \nreluctant to air their\u0014\n                         grievances in public, but this case is \ndifferent because\u0014\n                         parishioners can vote their unhappiness with \ntheir\u0014\n                         pocketbooks. Laws advisers say pending \nclaims may run\u0014\n                         to more than $30 million, but plaintiffs \nlawyers put the\u0014\n                         number much higher. The archdiocese made the\u0014\n                         extraordinary announcement that payments to \nsex-abuse\u0014\n                         victims would not come out of the collection \nplate or\u0014\n                         previously existing diocesan fund-raising \ndrives. So where\u0014\n                         will they come from? The church says it has \ninsurance, but\u0014\n                         sources say coverage has been spotty over \nthe past\u0014\n                         several decades and the archdiocese is in \nlitigation with\u0014\n                         one of its former insurers and is in \ndisputes with several\u0014\n                         others. Former Clinton appointee Mary Jo \nBane, a longtime\u0014\n                         member of St. Williams Parish in \nDorchester, is circulating\u0014\n                         a petition urging local Catholics to \nwithhold contributions to\u0014\n                         the archdiocese until the church gives a \nfull accounting of\u0014\n                         its financial plan. So far 175 people have \nsigned.\u0014\n                         Concerned that his contributions to \narchdiocesan funds\u0014\n                         might end up in plaintiffs attorneys \npockets, one\u0014\n                         prominent local businessman said he had \ndecided to direct\u0014\n                         all his current and projected donations, \nabout $20,000 in\u0014\n                         2002, to his local parish.\u0014\n                                 Still, Law has hardly run out of \nresources. On\u0014\n                         Valentines Day, he held a meeting of his \nfinance\u0014\n                         committee, a blue-chip group that includes \nfamed money\u0014\n                         manager Peter Lynch. He asked for their help \nraising\u0014\n                         money to pay for the litigationand went \nover a list of\u0014\n                         assets that could be liquidated or \nmortgaged, including a\u0014\n                         choice multiacre plot behind the cardinals \nfortresslike\u0014\n                         residence in Brighton. Hes not going to \nwalk away from\u0014\n                         this problem, says Robert Popeo, the \nhigh-powered\u0014\n                         Boston litigator who was called in as a pro \nbono consultant\u0014\n                         to the archdiocese, and may represent Law in \ncases where\u0014\n                         hes named as a defendant. He regards this \nas his\u0014\n                         problem to solve.\u0014\n                                 Elsewhere across the country, the \nchurch also seems\u0014\n                         to be starting to learn its lesson. Last \nweek the bishop of\u0014\n                         Manchester called a meeting of the dioceses \npriests to\u0014\n                         discuss restoring parishioners faith in the \nwake of sexual\u0014\n                         scandals there and in Boston. And the \nCatholic bishops\u0014\n                         issued a public apology: on behalf of all \nof the bishops,\u0014\n                         [we express] our profound sorrow that some \nof our priests\u0014\n                         were responsible for this abuse under our \nwatch.

A few days\u0014\n                     before the first Christmas of that long \nbloodletting then called the Great War, hundreds of\u0014\n                     thousands of cold, trench-bound combatants put \naside their arms and, in defiance of their\u0014\n                     orders, tacitly agreed to stop the killing in \nhonor of the holiday.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     That informal truce began with small acts: here \nopposing Scottish and German troops \u0014\n                     would toss newspapers, ration tins, and friendly \nremarks across the lines; there ambulance\u0014\n                     parties, clearing the dead from the barbwire \nhell of no man's land, would stop to share\u0014\n                     cigarettes and handshakes. Soon it spread, so \nthat by Christmas Eve the armies of France,\u0014\n                     England, and Germany were serenading each other \nwith Christmas carols and sentimental\u0014\n                     ballads and denouncing the conflict with cries \nof \" bas la guerre!\" and \"Nie wieder Krieg!\"\u0014\n                     The truce was, writes Stanley Weintraub, a \nremarkable episode, and, though \"dismissed in\u0014\n                     official histories as an aberration of no \nconsequence,\" it was so compelling that many who\u0014\n                     observed it wrote in near-disbelief to their \nfamilies and hometown newspapers to report the\u0014\n                     extraordinary event.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In the end, writes Weintraub, the truce ended \nwith a few stray bullets that escalated into total\u0014\n                     war, and that would fill the air for just shy of \nfour more Christmases to come; further, \u0014\n                     isolated\u0014\n                     attempts at informal peacemaking would fail. But \nwhat, Weintraub wonders at the close of\u0014\n                     this inspired study, would have happened if the \nsoldiers on both sides had refused to take\u0014\n                     up arms again? His counterfactual scenarios are \nintriguing, and well worth pondering. --\u0014\n                     Gregory McNamee \u0014\n\u0014\n                     From Publishers Weekly \u0014\n                     Popular historian Weintraub (MacArthur's War, \netc.), emeritus professor of arts and\u0014\n                     humanities at Penn State, tackles a sober \nsubject from WWI, when amid the millions of\u0014\n                     casualties in the obscene carnage of trench war, \na mutual agreement arose for a cease-fire\u0014\n                     at Christmastime of the first year of conflict. \nDrawing from secondary sources as well as\u0014\n                     much archival research in a variety of \nlanguages, Weintraub has compiled a brief, anecdotal\u0014\n                     account that reveals his skill as a researcher \nand... read more \u0014\n-----------------------------\u0014\n                     was curious to know why Weintraub wrote a book \nabout a brief period prior to\u0014\n                     Christmas in 1914, on the battlefields of \nFlanders, when German and British soldiers\u0014\n                     spontaneously agreed to declare a truce and \nsuspend fighting, thereby defying their\u0014\n                     commanding officers. The answer to that \nquestion, in my opinion, has profound\u0014\n                     significance 87 years later. No doubt the book's \nimpact on me is explained, at least in part,                         \nby the fact  that I read it during the holiday season, following the \nevents of September 11th, \u0014\n                     as a war on terrorism continues. But also \nbecause, as an eager student of military history, I \u0014\n                     am intrigued by isolated situations in which \nhumanity (for lack of a better term) at least \u0014\n                     temporarily prevails over death and destruction. \nCenturies ago, knights and their attendants \u0014\n                     would work with their enemies to clear a field \nfor combat the next day. Such cooperation had \u0014\n                     an obvious\u0014\n                     practical value. That's not what interests \nWeintraub as he examines a temporary truce\u0014\n                     during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It \nhad little (if any) practical or tactical value\u0014\n                     but it did (and does) suggest a human need which \ntranscends military obligations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Weintraub draws upon a wealth of primary sources \n(e.g. letters and diaries) in which\u0014\n                     firsthand accounts comment on the shared misery \ncreated by \"shells, bombs, underground\u0014\n                     caves, corpses, liquor, mice, cats, artillery, \nfilth, bullets, mortars, fire, and steel.\" I am\u0014\n                     reminded of movies such as All's Quiet on the \nWestern Front and Paths of Glory in which\u0014\n                     the human misery portrayed is almost unbearable \nto watch. I had the same reaction when\u0014\n                     seeing more recent movies such as Saving Private \nRyan and Black Hawk Down. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     As Weintraub explains in this book, at least \nsome of the opposing forces decided to call\u0014\n                     what we today would describe as a \"time out.\" \nSeveral displayed signboards and banners\u0014\n                     which said \"You no fight, we no fight\" (by the \nGermans) and \"Merry Christmas\" (by the\u0014\n                     British). Messages and holiday greetings were \nexchanged, sometimes conveyed by trained\u0014\n                     dogs serving as intermediaries. Weintraub \ncredits the Germans with taking the initiative but\u0014\n                     not all of the German soldiers and few of their \nofficers condoned the truce. (The choice of\u0014\n                     the book's title is apt. More than 200 years \nago, Joseph Mohr wrote the lyrics and Franx X.\u0014\n                     Gruber the music of \"Stille Nacht,\" a German \ncarol.) Nor did all of the Allied forces. Everyone\u0014\n                     involved correctly understood that battle would \nsoon resume but at least for a very brief\u0014\n                     time, everyone involved (to varying degrees) \nexperienced \"peace on earth, good will toward\u0014\n                     man.\" For many of them, death had merely been \ndelayed. How welcome it must have been\u0014\n                     to have a silent night or two after enduring \ndeafening bombardments. And no doubt an\u0014\n                     opportunity to reflect upon loved ones far away \nand to recall happier Christmases in the\u0014\n                     past. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     It is possible but highly unlikely that there \nwill ever again be a land war of the nature and to\u0014\n                     the extent of the two World Wars. Never again \nwill opposing warriors in near proximity\u0014\n                     exchange Christmas greetings and gifts. This is \npart of the significance of what Weintraub\u0014\n                     has recreated in his book: Warfare in the 21st \ncentury will mostly be waged by high-tech\u0014\n                     systems to deliver weapons of mass destruction \nto achieve global and regional military\u0014\n                     objectives. At least to this reader, Weintraub \nseems to ask: Why not eliminate war in any\u0014\n                     form so that the world can have a \"silent night\" \nevery night? Why not indeed?\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1914, as the Great War turned from a \nglorious adventure into a grinder of\u0014\n                     human meat, something unexpected and beautiful \nhappened. When Christmas Eve arrived,\u0014\n                     quite against orders, peace mysteriously broke \nout. In many places along No-Man's Land,\u0014\n                     soldiers from the opposing armies mingled, \ntraded trinkets, sang songs, and even played\u0014\n                     impromptu soccer matches. This is the story of \nthat all too brief interlude in that human\u0014\n                     tragedy that was the First World War.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The author of this book has brought together a \nwonderful book. It is a collection of\u0014\n                     anecdotes about that Christmas Truce, complete \nwith a series of pictures. Being a minor\u0014\n                     student of that tragic war, I could not help but \nbe touched by this story, being at times\u0014\n                     brought close to tears by some of the stories.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I must admit that I found the author's \nspeculation on what might have happened if the\u0014\n                     opposing armies had decided to make the peace \npermanent to be quite fanciful, and rather\u0014\n                     anticlimactic. That said, though, this is a \nwonderful book, one that is quite informative on a\u0014\n                     little studied chapter of World War I. I highly \nrecommend this book to all readers!\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n                                 Excerpt from Silent Night : The \nStory of World War I Christmas Truce \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Introduction\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Three myths would arise during the early months \nof the\u0014\n                     Great War. Burly Cossacks, sent by the Czar to \nbolster the\u0014\n                     Western Front, were seen embarking from British \nrailway\u0014\n                     stations for Dover, still shaking the persistent \nsnows of\u0014\n                     Russia from their boots. In France, during the \nBritish retreat from Mons, angels appeared --\u0014\n                     spirit bowmen out of the English past -- to \ncover the withdrawal. And the third was that, to\u0014\n                     the dismay of the generals, along the front \nlines late in December 1914, opponents in the\u0014\n                     West laid down their arms and celebrated \nChristmas together in a spontaneous gesture of\u0014\n                     peace on earth and good will toward men. Only \none of the myths -- the last -- was true.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In an issue sent to press just before Christmas, \nThe New Republic, an American weekly\u0014\n                     writing from a plague-on-both-sides neutrality, \naccepted what seemed obvious. \"If men \u0014\n                     must  hate, it is perhaps just as well that they \nmake no Christmas truce.\" A futile resolution \u0014\n                     had  been introduced in the Senate in Washington \nurging that the belligerents hold a \u0014\n                     twenty-day  truce at Christmas \"with the hope \nthat the cessation of hostilities at the said \ntime                      may  stimulate reflection upon the part of \nthe nations [at war] as to the meaning and spirit of\u0014\n                     Christmas time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Since early August the European war had claimed \nhundreds of thousands of killed,\u0014\n                     wounded, and missing. An appeal for a cease-fire \nat Christmas from Pope Benedict XV,\u0014\n                     elected just three months earlier, only weeks \nafter war had broken out, had made headlines\u0014\n                     but was quickly rebuffed by both sides as \n\"impossible.\" Rather, The New Republic\u0014\n                     suggested sardonically, \"The stench of battle \nshould rise above the churches where they\u0014\n                     preach good-will to men. A few carols, a little \nincense and some tinsel will heal no wounds.\"\u0014\n                     A wartime Christmas would be a festival \"so \nempty that it jeers at us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     To many, the end of the war and the failure of \nthe peace would validate the Christmas\u0014\n                     cease-fire as the only meaningful episode in the \napocalypse. It belied the bellicose slogans\u0014\n                     and suggested that the men fighting and often \ndying were, as usual, proxies for\u0014\n                     governments and issues that had little to do \nwith their everyday lives. A candle lit in the\u0014\n                     darkness of Flanders, the truce flickered \nbriefly and survives only in memoirs, letters, song,\u0014\n                     drama and story.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Live-and-let-live\" accommodations occur in all \nwars. Chronicles at least since Troy record\u0014\n                     cessations in fighting to bury the dead, to pray \nto the gods, to negotiate a peace, to\u0014\n                     assuage war weariness, to offer signs of amity \nto enemies so long opposite in a static war                        as \nto encourage mutual respect. None had ever occurred on the scale of, \nor with the \u0014\n                     duration, or with the potential for changing \nthings, as when the shooting suddenly stopped \u0014\n                     on  Christmas Eve, 1914. The difference in 1914 \nwas its potential to become more than a\u0014\n                     temporary respite. The event appears in \nretrospect somehow unreal, incredible in its\u0014\n                     intensity and extent, seemingly impossible to \nhave happened without consequences for the\u0014\n                     outcome of the war. Like a dream, when it was \nover, men wondered at it, then went on with\u0014\n                     the grim business at hand. Under the rigid \ndiscipline of wartime command authority, that\u0014\n                     business was killing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Dismissed in official histories as an aberration \nof no consequence, that remarkable \u0014\n                     moment  happened. For the rival governments, for \nwhich war was politics conducted by \u0014\n                     persuasive force, it was imperative to make even \ntemporary peace unappealing and \u0014\n                     unworkable, only an impulsive interval in a \nnecessarily hostile and competitive world. The \u0014\n                     impromptu truce seemed dangerously akin to the \npopulist politics of the streets, the \u0014\n                     spontaneous movements that topple tyrants and \nautocrats. For that reason alone, high \u0014\n                     commands could not permit it \u0014\n                     to gain any momentum to expand in time and in \nspace, or to capture broad appeal back\u0014\n                     home. That it did not was more accident than \ndesign.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     After a silent night and day -- in many sectors \nmuch more than that -- the war went on. The\u0014\n                     peace seemed nearly forgotten. Yet memories of \nChristmas 1914 persist, and underlying\u0014\n                     them the compelling realities and the intriguing \nmight-have-beens. What if...?\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Late in December 1999 a group of nine quirky \n\"Khaki Chums\" crossed the English Channel\u0014\n                     to Flanders with the \"blatantly daft idea\" of \ncommemorating the truce where it may have\u0014\n                     begun, near Ploegsteert Wood in Belgium. Wearing \nmakeshift uniforms recalling 1914, and\u0014\n                     working in the rain and snow, they dug trenches, \nreinforcing them with sandbags and \u0014\n                     planks which \"literally disappeared into the \nbottomless mud.\" For several days they cooked                        \ntheir  their parapets, and slept soaked through to the skin. They \nalso endured\u0014\n                     curious onlookers and enjoyed visits from the \nmedia. Before departing, the nine planted a\u0014\n                     large timber cross in the quagmire as a \ntemporary mark of respect for the wartime dead,\u0014\n                     filled back their trenches and slogged homeward.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Months later they were astonished to learn that \nlocal villagers had treated their crude\u0014\n                     memorial with a wood preservative and set it in \na concrete base. In season, now, poppies\u0014\n                     flower beneath it. Thousands of Great War \nmonuments, some moving and others mawkish,\u0014\n                     remain in town squares and military cemeteries \nacross Europe. The afterthought of the\u0014\n                     \"Khaki Chums\" lark in the Flanders mud is the \nonly memorial to the Christmas Truce of\u0014\n                     1914.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Copyright  2001 by Stanley Weintraub \u0014\n\u0014\n                     --From Silent Night : The Story of World War I \nChristmas Truce, by Stanley Weintraub.

    "words": "Starter Marriages: Gen X Giving Up Too Early?\u0014\nBY Jodi Mathews\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just Married, Just Split Up,\" and \"Young, Hot and Divorced\" \nheadlined two articles in different popular magazines. In September \n2000, Entertainment Weekly included \"divorcing in your 20s\" on its \nlist of \"in\" things to do, according to ABCNEWS.com. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeneration X is working hard to escape the stigma of divorce, and the \nnew phrase \"starter marriages\" may lend it the leverage it needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nPamela Paul, an editor of American Demographics magazine and author \nof The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony, defined starter \nmarriages as \"first-time marriages that last five years or less and \ndo not yield children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul asserted that this type of marriage is a growing trend among Gen \nXers, citing U.S. Census Bureau statistics showing that in 1998 there \nwere more than 3 million divorced 18- to 29-year-olds. In 1962, there \nwere 253,000 divorced 25- to 29-year-olds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to ABCNEWS.com, Paul said most young couples who divorce \nearly rushed into marriage for one of two reasons: \"either they have \nfinished school and are living with their parents and want someone \nelse to cling to, or they are very successful power couples who feel \nthat they need a great marriage to complement their fabulous career \nand looks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that no matter the reasoning, divorce is always \npainful, Chris Canipe, premarital counselor and director of divorce \nrecovery at First Baptist Church in Greensboro, N.C., told \nEthicsDaily.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nCanipe, who is also a clinical member of the American Association for \nMarriage and Family Therapy, said starter marriages are \"attempts to \nresolve perceived individual shortcomings.\"\u0014\nIn his premarital counseling sessions, Canipe said he asks the hard \nquestions.\u0014\n\"When I perceive that the couple may be heading for the 'starter \nmarriage' I put as much heat on them as possible so they will be \nforced to face difficult issues in a safe setting with a supportive \nreferee, me,\" he said. \"I count as successes those individuals who \ndecide not to get married based on premarital counseling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul wrote in her book that many happy young couples \"are focused on \nthe wedding day, and they don't give much thought to what is going to \nhappen in the next 50 years.\"\u0014\nThis hyper-focus on the present, or the wedding day, becomes a \nproblem after the ceremony.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Marriage is the ultimate relational commitment, and engaged couples \nwould do well to spend more time with their premarital counselor than \nwith their florist,\" Mary Stairs Vaughn, assistant professor of \ncommunication studies at Belmont University, told EthicsDaily.com. \n\"Exploring and sharing relational needs and expectations should \nhappen well before the exchange of rings.\"\u0014\nVaughn said she feared that reframing early divorce as a \"starter \nmarriage\" may lead to socially sanctioning it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I wonder if the concept of 'starter marriages' feeds our cultural \ndesensitization to the seriousness of breaking that contract and \nvow,\" she said. \"Divorce is deeply painful, and I would hate to see \nit become a 'status symbol' for young twenty-somethings.\"\u0014\nMany starter marriages involve the first children of the divorced \ngeneration, Paul said in the ABCNEWS.com article. Although their \nparents divorced, this group believes they will not. But they realize \nthat divorce is a viable option.\u0014\nAccepting divorce as an option may be the first step on the road to \nan unhappy marriage and an early divorce, Maggie Gallagher, affiliate \nscholar at the Institute for American Values and the co-author of The \nCase for Marriage: Why Married People Are Happier, Healthier, and \nBetter Off Financially, told EthicsDaily.com.\u0014\n\"The more people see marriage as temporary or impermanent, the less \nhappy they will be in their own marriages,\" Gallagher said. \u0014\nMerely adopting more liberal ideas about divorce might make some \npeople more susceptible to it, she said. When divorce is perceived as \na viable option, the marriage becomes more like a co-habitation.\u0014\n\"Parents focus heavily on their children becoming good students and \nvarious things when they are young. What parents need to focus on \nfrom an early age is reinforcing the importance of getting married, \nstaying married and producing a healthy family,\" Gallagher said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother way young people can get off on the right foot is through \nmentoring programs with older, more seasoned couples.\"Churches need \nto take seriously the job of preparing young people for marriage and \nintervening when marriages become troubled,\" Gallagher said. \"This \n'marriage mentoring' is useful in building marriages, churches and \ncommunities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJodi Mathews is BCE's communications director\u0014",

In a summer poll, 3-in-10 said \nSatan was merely symbolic. Now only 2-in-10 deny his existence.

    "words": "February 21, 2001 \u0014\nMedia Contact: Eric Altschuler, UCSD Department of Psychology, \u0014\n(858) 822-0606 or Dolores Davies, University Communications, (858) \n.534-5994\u0014\n\u0014\nBIBLICAL HERO SAMSON MAY HAVE BEEN SOCIOPATH\u0014\nAS WELL AS STRONGMAN, ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH\u0014\n\u0014\nSamson, the Israelite hero and judge who was undone by the temptress \nDelilah, exhibited almost all of the symptoms of a person with \nAntisocial Personality Disorder, known in the psychology trade as \nASPD.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Dr. Eric Altschuler, Samson exhibited six out seven \ncriteria for diagnosis of ASPD (as identified by the American \nPsychiatric Association in its diagnostic bible, the DSM-IV) and a \nperson need only manifest three of the seven criteria to be diagnosed \nwith the disorder. Altschuler, a physician and research fellow in the \nDept. of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego, is \nthe lead author of the research paper, Did Samson Have Antisocial \nPersonality Disorder? published in this months Archives of General \nPsychiatry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAppreciation of the diagnosis of ASPD for Samson may not only help \nus to better understand the Biblical story, but it also may increase \nour understanding and awareness of instances when a leader has ASPD  \nsaid Altschuler, Also, we hope these findings encourage interest in \nthe history of ASPD because the study of the history of a disease can \nprovide clues to its pathogenesis.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough credited with extraordinary strength and remarkable exploits \n-- such as the slaying of a lion and moving the gates of Gaza - \nSamson also, apparently, was a bully, a thief, and a liar. Altschuler \nand his co-authors cite a number of questionable acts as evidence of \nhis ASPD diagnosis including: his failure to conform to social norms \nby torching the Philistines fields and then refusing arrest; his \nrepeated lying to his parents, including not telling them that he had \nkilled a lion; his impulsivity as evidenced by his burning of the \nPhilistine fields; his repeated involvement in physical fights, \nbullying, and cruelty to animals; his reckless disregard for the \nsafety of others - he was reported to have taken on and killed no \nless than a 1000 Philistines; and his lack of remorse, as evidenced \nby his gloating after the killing of 1000 men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be noted that Samson also displayed many of the behaviors \nlisted in the criteria for conduct disorder, added Altschuler, such \nas fire setting, cruelty to small animals, bullying, initiating \nphysical fights, using a weapon (jawbone of ass), and stealing from a \nvictim. If his conduct disorder did not start when he was younger \nthan fifteen, Samson was quite young.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Samson showed no signs of schizophrenia, some of his \nbehaviors, for example not telling his parents that the honey he gave \nthem originated from the carcass of a lion, were done in a non-manic \nstate, according to the researchers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Samsons poor behavior, brutal and bloodthirsty even for \nthose days, was not acceptable to his fellow Israelites. In Chapter \n15, Verse 12 (Old Testament Book of Judges), some 3000 Israelites - \nSamsons own people - captured Samson and delivered him to the \nPhilistines.\u0014\n\u0014\nAltschuler first noticed that Samson might meet the criteria for ASPD \nwhen he happened to be reading the story of Samson in Judges 1, \nChapters 13-16. This reading prompted Altschuler, who works on stroke \nrehabiltation at UCSDs Brain and Perception Laboratory, to \ninvestigate further.\u0014",

    "title": "SAMSON WAS \"MENTALLY ILL\"",
    "words": "Health Magazine\u0014\nThursday, 15 February, 2001 \u0014\nSamson 'was mentally ill'\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Biblical strong man Samson suffered from the earliest recorded \ncase of anti-social personality disorder, a scientist claims. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr Eric Altschuler, from the University of California, in San Diego, \nclaims that instead of being a hero, Samson was actually mentally \nill. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a report in the New Scientist, Dr Altschuler said that in today's \nsociety Samson would be seen as \"a bit of a thug\". \u0014\n\u0014\nHe said he had gone back to his Bible and started to re-appraise \nSamson in a totally new light. \u0014\n\"I knew the story of Samson from when I was a kid. I re-read the \nstory and the general impression was that he was a strong man, but I \nfound that he was anti-social. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I used to go to Sunday school I thought he was good and led the \nbattles. \u0014\n\u0014\n'No remorse' \u0014\n\"He starts the fights and the battles. He is a bit of a thug,\" he \nsaid. \u0014\nDr Altschuler said Samson routinely got into fights, killed 1,000 \nPhilistines single-handedly and then gloated over it and showed no \nremorse. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe also showed a reckless regard for his own safety when he told \nDelilah, a woman who had already tried to kill him three times, the \nsecret of his strength. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll these Dr Altschuler said point to Samson having an anti-social \npersonality disorder (ASPD). \u0014\nPeople diagnosed with ASPD exhibit at least three of seven specific \nbehavioural traits such as being impulsive, reckless and habitually \ngetting into fights. \u0014\n\u0014\nSamson shows six out of the seven characteristics. He is impulsive \nhas an inability to conform to social norms and is deceitful. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr Altschuler said the Biblical tale clearly shows Samson was \nsuffering mental health problems from an early age, setting things on \nfire, torturing animals, stealing and bullying other children. \u0014\n\u0014\nFamily problems \u0014\nAnd problems seem to have run through Samson's family, a whole \nchapter in the Bible is devoted to Samson's mother being warned by \nangels not to drink. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr Altschuler says this shows she too was reckless and had a \ndisregard for others. \u0014\nKevin Gibson, a consultant clinical psychologist and head of adult \npsychology at Sunderland Hospitals Trust, said society would view \nSamson in a different light today. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Today we would see his ruthlessness and exploitiveness as having a \npersonality disorder,\" he said. \u0014\nBut Mr Gibson, a member of the British Psychological Society, said \nSamson's problems would have only been picked up then, as now, if \nthey affected his ability to function in society.\u0014",

    "title": "SIGMUND FREUD AND C.S. LEWIS: TWO CULTURAL GIANTS",
    "words": "Two Cultural Giants\u0014\nBoth Sigmund Freud and C. S. Lewis were emotionally wounded as boys \nand struggled with depression as men. But a worldview can make a \ntremendous difference.\u0014\nBy David Neff | posted 04/19/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nMany schools of psychology have come and gone since Freud died. And \nyet he has a cultural legacy. What is that legacy?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most important part of Freud's legacy is his influence on our \nlanguage. We use termsego, repression, projection, neurosis, sibling \nrivalry, and Freudian slipwithout realizing their source. In \naddition, his theories influence how we interpret human behaviorin \nhistory, literary criticism, biography, sociology, medicine, \neducation, and ethics. We now take for granted that early life \nexperiences influence how we think and feel and behave as adults. For \nexample, before Freud, we had little awareness of the traumatic \neffects of child sexual abuse. Now we read of such cases every day. \nHis influence is so profound, historians refer to the 20th century as \n\"the century of Freud.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWould Lewis have agreed that childhood experiences influence us?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes. He was acutely aware of the influence of his early childhood, \nespecially his mother's death when he was 9 years old. Lewis never \nfully recovered. In his autobiography, he writes extensively about \nboth the positive and negative early experiences that shaped his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou write that \"the early life experiences show striking \nparallelism.\" If those experiences of love and loss were so similar, \nwhy did these men turn out so different?\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil Lewis came to a personal faith, they were very much \nalikegifted intellectually, introspective, highly critical and wary \nof others, clinically depressed, pessimistic, gloomy and hostile \ntoward their fathers and toward all authorityespecially to the \nnotion of an Ultimate Authority, etc. Then, in his early 30s, Lewis \nhad a conversion experience that transformed his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou've done empirical research on the religious conversions of \nuniversity students. What did you learn from comparing the students' \nconversions with Lewis's?\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Lewis and the students observed in believers some quality that \nwas missing in their own lives. Lewis observed this in other Oxford \nfaculty members and in the lives of some of the great writers he \nadmired. The students observed this in some of their peers who \npossessed a strong faith. Both Lewis and the students made a \nconscious effort to open their minds and look at the evidence. Lewis \nbegan reading the New Testament in Greek and the students attended \nBible study groups on campus. Both Lewis and the students came to \nfaith in the context of a modern, liberal university where the \nclimate tends to be hostile. The spiritual worldview is often thought \nto be only for the ignorant masses, a psychological crutch that never \nworks. Some consider it, as did Freud, an expression of pathology.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Lewis turned out to be better adjusted as a result.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Lewis and the students functioned more effectively after their \nconversion experience. The students who underwent what they called a \n\"religious conversion\" reported a radical change in lifestylean \nabrupt halt in the use of drugs, an enhanced self-image, a more \nforgiving spirit toward others and toward themselves, better control \nof impulses, an increased capacity for establishing \"close, \nsatisfying relationships,\" a marked change in their mood or affect, \nand a lessening of what they referred to as \"existential despair.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFriends who knew Lewis before and after his conversion noted many of \nthe same changes in him. The quality of his relationships changed. He \nbecame more outgoing. He said his conversion was the beginning of his \nturning outward. He had a new evaluation of peoplehe realized every \nhuman being would live forever, long after our institutions, \ngovernments, and nations are long goneand therefore are of \ninfinitely more value.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou devote a chapter to Freud and Lewis on sex. Who was better \nadjusted sexually?\u0014\n\u0014\nThough we think of Freud as the father of the new sexuality, he lived \na rather restricted sexual life. His letters and his biographers \nindicate he lived the traditional sexual code of sex within marriage \nwith complete fidelity or abstinence. Because of his long medical \ntraining he could not afford to marry until about 30 years old. \nDuring a long, four-year engagement, most biographers agree, he did \nnot have sexual relations with his fiance. Freud's official \nbiographer noted that Freud remained faithful throughout his \nmarriage. His sexual life during marriage appeared to be quite \nrestrictedhe wrote to a friend when 37 years old that \"we are now \nliving in abstinence.\" Scholars give various reasons for this \nabstinence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis gives us few details of his sexual life before his conversion. \nWhen in the army, he avoided visiting prostitutesperhaps out of fear \nof disease. He describes a robust sexual desire that he became aware \nof in his early teens. Before his conversion, he speaks of trying to \nlive a moral life but finding that he continually failed in the areas \nof \"lust and anger.\" And when he began to look at his life seriously, \nhe wrote that he was \"appalled\" by the \"zoo of lusts\" within him. \nWhen he finally married in his 50s, he had a very fulfilling sexual \nlife. He wrote later that he and his wife \"feasted on love; every \nmode of it.No cranny of heart or body remained unsatisfied.\" His \nwife wrote: \"You'd think we were a honeymoon couple in our early 20s.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFreud famously asked, \"What do women want?\" Lewis, on the other hand, \ncarried on a tremendous correspondence with women. Did either man \never come to understand the opposite sex?\u0014\n\u0014\nFreud acknowledged that he had difficulty understanding women. He \nreferred to the sexuality of women as a \"Dark Continent.\" Many of his \ntheories have outraged feminists, and he is often accused of being \nprejudiced against women. Yet he had many women followers, and many \nof the first psychoanalysts were women with whom he had a good \nworking relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis also had many women friends whom he admired and with whom he \ncorresponded. He appeared to have an unusual understanding of women, \nperhaps not only from the great literature, but also from living with \nhis surrogate mother, Mrs. Moore, and her daughter. His scholarly \nwork The Allegory of Love focused on the love between a man and a \nwoman, and his popular writings on modern marriage and the family \ncontain a great deal of clinical insight and understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreud is known for saying that the well-adjusted adult needs the \nability to love and to work. How would you compare Freud's and \nLewis's understanding of work?\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth worked hard at their professions, both wrote prolifically. Freud \nand Lewis, before his conversion, were driven by a strong desire to \nbe famous. When Freud was 17 years old he advised a friend to save \nhis [Freud's] letters because someday he would be famous. During his \nself-analysis, he related his desire to be famous to a story told him \nas a child that an old peasant woman prophesied that his mother had \ngiven birth to a great man. When in his 50s, he said that \"in view of \nthe inevitable ingratitude of humanityI certainly do not work \nbecause of the expectation of any reward or fame.\" Yet his diary and \nhis letters indicate the desire remained.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore his conversion, C. S. Lewis had \"dreams of success and fame.\" \nAfter his conversion, Lewis considered his desire to be famous as a \nwriter to be a serious flaw. The desire to be better known than \nothers fostered pride. When he concentrated on writing well and \nforgot about becoming famous, he both wrote well and became \nrecognized for itperhaps reinforcing his oft-repeated principle that \nwhen first things are put first, second things don't decrease; they \nincrease.\u0014\n\u0014\nCould you compare Lewis and Freud on the subject of happiness?\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth men suffered from clinical depression. Lewis also showed signs \nof clinical depression before his conversion. In his diary and \nletters, he appears irritable, pessimistic, gloomy, and hopeless. He \nsays his atheism was based on his \"very pessimistic view of \nexistence.\" After his conversion, all of this changed. He said joy \nwas \"the central story of my life.\" His friends then described him as \ncheerful and outgoing. Lewis found happiness in his newly established \nrelationship with the Creator. Lewis said that God cannot give us \n\"happiness apart from Himself, because it is not there, there is no \nsuch thing.\" His new faith helped him overcome his depression. Recent \nmedical research has shed considerable light on the positive effects \nof faith on treating depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreud, on the other hand, used cocaine when in his 20s for a period \nof time to lift his depression. He equated happiness with pleasure, \nand in his mind the greatest source of pleasure is instinctual \ngratification, sexual pleasure. And because that occurs only \nperiodically, he thinks that it's not in the cards for human beings \nto be happy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis was certainly no foe of pleasure.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis divides happiness into many categories, but he says they all \ncome from the same source. He knew the pleasure of just watching a \nsunset or listening to great music or taking a hot bath. He seemed to \nhave the capacity to enjoy the little pleasures in life. And he said \nthat half of all happiness comes from friendships\u0014\n.\u0014\nFreud, on the other hand, seemed to have a limited capacity to enjoy \nthe ordinary pleasures. And he didn't express much happiness in his \nletters. He obviously found happiness with his children and his \nfamily, but most of his writings indicate that life is not a \nparticularly happy experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "STONING AND SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "April 30, 2002, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nStoning and Scripture\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\n \u0014\nKARTOUM, Sudan  One of the central challenges for any religion is to \nevolve, to adjust ancient scriptures to modern life. That challenge \nframed the debate as judges here in Sudan puzzled over whether Abok \nAlfa Akok should be stoned to death for adultery.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Akok, 18, married last year, and soon afterward her husband left \ntown to look for work. When he returned four months later, she was \npregnant  but, alas, not four months pregnant.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge decided that the conception was unlikely to have been \nimmaculate. He sentenced Ms. Akok to the ancient Islamic penalty for \nadultery, execution by stoning. Ultimately, the Sudan Supreme Court \ncommuted the sentence to 75 lashes, which were promptly applied.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe barbarity of the \"hudud,\" or ancient Islamic punishments, raises \na larger question: To what extent should Muslims turn to literal \nprescriptions in the Koran for guidance in the 21st century? \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is critical, for one of the impediments to development in the \nIslamic world  and one reason for terrorism against the West  is \nthat many people are struggling to hold on to literal interpretations \nof the Koran in a world in which that no longer makes sense. If \nMuslim countries are to modernize, they must find ways to update \ntraditional religious doctrines about punishment, the role of women, \nthe ban on interest payments that precludes modern banking and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nIslamic countries simply cannot build 21st-century economies on \nseventh-century scripture, not least because that would exclude \neconomic participation by half the population.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been pestering Muslims and religious scholars with such \nquestions over recent weeks, and overwhelmingly they are optimistic \nthat Islam is already embarked on a reformation. They cite two \nreasons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, a process of \"ijtihad,\" or looser reinterpretation, is already \nwell underway. Early Muslim objections to printing presses, radios \nand international travel are now forgotten, and Islamic reformers \n(many of them, like Khaled Abou El Fadl of U.C.L.A. law school, from \nperches in America or Europe) are pressing for reinterpretations of \nthe Koran.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's been stressed from the beginning that the Koran is not a law \nbook but a book of exhortations, and the responsibility rests with \nthe community to figure out ways to implement those moral principles \nin changing circumstances,\" said Tamara Sonn, a scholar of Islam at \nthe College of William and Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hudud are rarely applied and arise mostly when insecure \npost-colonial leaders try to bolster their legitimacy by playing the \namputation card. That's what has happened in the last couple of \ndecades in Pakistan, Nigeria and Sudan (where the introduction of \nIslamic law beginning in 1983 prompted a rebellion that has killed \nmore than two million people so far).\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Imagine you woke up one day and found that Jehovah's Witnesses had \ntaken over your government,\" explained Taisier Ali, one of the \nrebels. \"That's like what happened to us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA second reason for optimism is a look at the history of Christianity \nand Judaism. All religions have scriptures that say some ridiculous \nthings, Islam no more than others. The trick of modernization has \nbeen to interpret the ridiculous bits away as merely \"allegorical.\" \nFor example, the Bible stipulates that \"a stubborn and rebellious \nson\" shall be stoned to death (Deuteronomy 21). It states that if \nyour wife entices you toward a new religion, you shall kill her \n(Deuteronomy 13).\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian ijtihad has been an ongoing process. My \ngreat-great-grandfather was so devoted to the Sabbath in a very \nliteral way that when recruited for a railroad job, he said he would \ntake it only if the company stopped running trains on Sundays.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven today, some 45 percent of Americans say in polls they believe in \nthe creationist theory of how the world was formed, and President \nBush expresses uncertainty about evolution. And consider the Catholic \nstruggle to adjust dogma on celibacy or ordination of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn L. Esposito, a scholar of religion at Georgetown University and \nauthor of a new book on Islam, notes that Christianity and Judaism \nevolved gradually, and sometimes bloodily, over many centuries, while \nin Islam the pressure is accelerated.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Reformation in Islam is inevitable,\" Professor Esposito said. \"But \nMuslims are faced with having to do it in a very compressed time.\"\u0014",

Such a stance isolates \nthe problem\u0014\n                         and, conservatives seem to hope, forecloses \ntalk about the\u0014\n                         future of celibacy, married priests or, at \nthe farthest edge,\u0014\n                         ordaining openly gay clergy and blessing \nsame-sex unions.\u0014\n                         By pointing their fingers mainly at \nhomosexuality, these\u0014\n                         church leaders are avoiding discussion of \nthe questions\u0014\n                         that should be front and center: the roots \nand costs of a\u0014\n                         culture of sexual repression and secrecy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 After some confusion last week over \nwhether the\u0014\n                         prelates had decided on a one strike \npolicy, Cardinal\u0014\n                         Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia made it \nclear. I speak\u0014\n                         for the cardinals, he said. All of the \ncardinals are agreed\u0014\n                         on zero tolerance, and by that I mean that \nwe are all\u0014\n                         agreed that no priest guilty of even one act \nof sexual abuse\u0014\n                         of a minor will function in any ministry or \nany capacity in our\u0014\n                         dioceses. An obvious answer, and long \noverdue.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 To traditionalists, sexuality is a \ncritical line of defense\u0014\n                         against modernity and what they see as moral \nconfusion; to\u0014\n                         reformers, it could be the last frontier to \ncross in the battles\u0014\n                         over identity. That is why, for all its \nsordidness, the Catholic\u0014\n                         crisis should prompt a broader conversation \nabout how far\u0014\n                         Christianity still has to go to resolve its \ncomplexes about the\u0014\n                         larger issue of sexuality. Churches have \ntrouble handling\u0014\n                         cases of abuse because they often have \ntrouble dealing\u0014\n                         with sex, period. There is a strong theme of \nhypocrisy\u0014\n                         running through all this. Bishops will \nordain men they know\u0014\n                         to be gay in order to fill the pulpits, then \nuphold a code and\u0014\n                         culture that suggests homosexuality is what \nCardinal\u0014\n                         Bevilacqua last week referred to as an \nintrinsic evil.\u0014\n                         Celibacynot only in Catholic circlesis all \ntoo often\u0014\n                         honored in the breach; pastors can fall into \nsin with ladies\u0014\n                         of the parish. And in the Catholic Church, \nwomen are asked\u0014\n                         for time and treasure but cannot be priests.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Many believers, at least in America, \nsense the tension\u0014\n                         and seem open to change. In the latest \nNEWSWEEK Poll,\u0014\n                         50 percent of Catholics feel at odds with \nchurch teachings\u0014\n                         on human sexuality, up from 40 percent in \n1993. Fifty-nine\u0014\n                         percent do not think screening gays out of \nthe priesthood\u0014\n                         would make much difference in reducing the \nproblem of\u0014\n                         abuse. Fully half of Catholics (51 percent) \nsay they would\u0014\n                         attend a church with an openly gay priest. \nSeventy-three\u0014\n                         percent would allow married priests; 65 \npercent favor\u0014\n                         ordaining women.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         For many of us, faith, like history, is an \nunfinished\u0014\n                         story, a running argument. Though it is \nhard, Christians are\u0014\n                         called to bear the Gospels central message \nin mind when\u0014\n                         confronting the challenges of our time. \nFacing a decision,\u0014\n                         evangelicals like to ask: What would Jesus \ndo? As a\u0014\n                         believing, middle-of-the-road, churchgoing \nEpiscopalian, I\u0014\n                         am, in thinking and temperament, about as \nfar from an\u0014\n                         evangelical as you can get. But they do have \na point: it\u0014\n                         helps to be reminded that the Christian \nstory is one of\u0014\n                         revolution, of rethinking assumptions, of \noverturning, as\u0014\n                         Jesus did the tables in the temple, the \norder of the world as\u0014\n                         we find it. In the Sermon on the Mount, \nChrist says, But I\u0014\n                         say to you that listen, Love your enemies, \ndo good to those\u0014\n                         who hate you, bless those who curse you, \npray for those\u0014\n                         who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the \ncheek, offer\u0014\n                         the other also... Do to others as you would \nhave them do to\u0014\n                         you.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Theological arguments are often a \nwilderness of\u0014\n                         mirrors: appeals to Scripture and tradition \ncan be made in\u0014\n                         the service of completely different points \nof view. Every\u0014\n                         generation assesses its own time by its own \nlights.\u0014\n                         Conservatives tend to resist this reality; \nliberals too often\u0014\n                         abuse it, calling for change for the sake of \nchange. To\u0014\n                         move the conversation forward, its time to \nexplore the\u0014\n                         surprising scriptural and historical nuances \nof the reforms\u0014\n                         being suggested in some quarters of \nChristianityabout\u0014\n                         the role of homosexuals in the ministry and \nin the\u0014\n                         community, the future of clerical celibacy \nand chastity, and\u0014\n                         the place of women. Its a journey that \ncould lead us to\u0014\n                         rethink the connection between sexuality and \nthe\u0014\n                         sacraments.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                         I. THE GAY DILEMMA\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Out in the pews, the faithful sense that the \nscandal is\u0014\n                         tied to fundamental issues, and not only of \npower and\u0014\n                         accountability. There is some essential \ndisconnect\u0014\n                         between the Roman Catholic patriarchy and \nthe reality of\u0014\n                         sexuality, says Peggie Thorp, a 53-year-old \nCatholic from\u0014\n                         Wellesley, Mass., who joined with others \nfrom her church to\u0014\n                         protest Cardinal Bernard Laws handling of \nthe crisis.\u0014\n                         Theres a distance I have always kept and \nhave had to\u0014\n                         keep, a gay priest says. I cant share \nwith people the\u0014\n                         struggle inside of me. In a way, Im less \nthan human.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 He has a lot of company. The best \nguess is that\u0014\n                         between 35 and 50 percent of Roman Catholic \npriests are\u0014\n                         homosexual. Hypocrisy is almost too weak a \nword for what\u0014\n                         the hierarchy is doing, says Mark D. \nJordan, a professor of\u0014\n                         religion at Emory University and a gay \nCatholic. If there\u0014\n                         were no homosexuals in the priesthood, we \nwould soon\u0014\n                         cease to have a functioning church. There \nis a gap in the\u0014\n                         church between reality and rhetoric, and in \nreligion words\u0014\n                         matter. Though bishops ordain people they \nmay know to be\u0014\n                         homosexual, the prevailing sense, as the \ncardinals made\u0014\n                         clear in Rome, is that the orientation is \nunnatural.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Would welcoming people to the \nCatholic and\u0014\n                         Protestant clerical ranks who wish to be \nopen about their\u0014\n                         sexual orientation to their congregations \nlead to a healthier\u0014\n                         ecclesiastical culture? Would priests and \nbelievers be\u0014\n                         happier and more committed if their sexual \norientation were\u0014\n                         accepted? And would acknowledging healthy \norientations\u0014\n                         help reform a milieu of repression that may \nbe a factor in\u0014\n                         clergy preying on minors? I think what Im \ninterested in is a\u0014\n                         good priest, and I dont think a good priest \nis determined in\u0014\n                         any way, shape or form by his or her \nsexuality, says Louis\u0014\n                         P. Vitullo, 57, a Chicago lawyer educated in \nCatholic\u0014\n                         schools and a regular churchgoer. Is the \nperson well\u0014\n                         balanced? Can the person meet the needs of \nthe people to\u0014\n                         whom they render their priestly services? \nAnd, most\u0014\n                         basically, are they people we can trust? \u0014\n\u0014\n                         The traditionalists take on homosexuality \nis roughly this: that God\u0014\n                         created us man and woman so that we might,  \nwithin the sacrament of\u0014\n                         marriage, produce  children in his image.  \nThe classic Catholic\u0014\n                         view is that sexual love within the bond of \nmarriage is intended to\u0014\n                         deepen the communion of the spousesa \ncommunion which gives\u0014\n                         birth to new life, says George Weigel, the \ndistinguished biographer of John Paul\u0014\n                         II. The two go together. Sexuality is not \nan end in itself;\u0014\n                         affections are always ordered to something. \nWilliam\u0014\n                         Merrell, a spokesman for the Southern \nBaptist Convention,\u0014\n                         says, The Scripture clearly and \nunequivocally declares\u0014\n                         that homosexuality is a sin against God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The Scriptures are actually not \nquite so clear and\u0014\n                         unequivocal. Readers usually look to five or \nsix passages\u0014\n                         for Gods word on homosexuality and engage \nin pitched\u0014\n                         fights over their precise meanings. \nLeft-leaning critics\u0014\n                         dismiss each in turn, pointing out that the \nprohibitions can\u0014\n                         be explained away when read in context. The \nstory of\u0014\n                         Sodom, they say, is really about a failure \nof hospitality. The\u0014\n                         Levitical sections are more concerned with \nkeeping classes\u0014\n                         of things from being mixed (different seeds \nshould not be\u0014\n                         planted in the same field; cloth may not be \nmade of\u0014\n                         separate sorts of yarn).\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 In fact, the Biblical defense of \nslavery is stronger than\u0014\n                         the case against homosexuality, and no one \nappeals to\u0014\n                         Scripture in support of that anymore. (The \nVatican was, by\u0014\n                         the way, a leading voice for abolition \naround the world.)\u0014\n                         Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear \nand trembling,\u0014\n                         in singleness of heart, as you obey \nChrist... writes Saint\u0014\n                         Paul. Anti-Semitism was long justified by \npassages like this\u0014\n                         one from I Thessalonians: the Jews ... \nkilled both the Lord\u0014\n                         Jesus and the prophets... And the \nsubjugation of women\u0014\n                         had a foundation in I Timothy: As in all \nthe churches of the\u0014\n                         saints, women should be silent in the \nchurches... If there is\u0014\n                         anything they desire to know, let them ask \ntheir husbands\u0014\n                         at home. For it is shameful for a woman to \nspeak in\u0014\n                         church. And yet in each case, enlightened \npeople have\u0014\n                         moved on from the world view such passages \nexpress.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Thoughtful conservatives like Weigel \nsay these\u0014\n                         analogies arent quite apt, because \nhomosexuality is\u0014\n                         something that should be managed. Isnt the \nmore\u0014\n                         appropriate analogy than race or gender the \ninborn\u0014\n                         capacity for speech, or friendship? asks \nWeigel. At some\u0014\n                         point babble has to become language and raw \nemotion has\u0014\n                         to become love. From the Catholic point of \nview, it is clear\u0014\n                         that while the orientation, or disposition, \nis not sinful, it is\u0014\n                         disordered. We all have the inclination to \nanger or cruelty,\u0014\n                         and we must order those inclinations. We \nhave to learn\u0014\n                         mastery and self-command. No reasonable \nperson doubts\u0014\n                         that this is a tremendous challenge for \nhomosexuals, as\u0014\n                         indeed mastery of passions is a great \nchallenge for\u0014\n                         heterosexuals. But, in this view, the \nmastering must be\u0014\n                         done.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The more we learn about the roots of \nhomosexuality,\u0014\n                         though, the more it appears that an \nattraction to the same\u0014\n                         sex is something you are born with or \ndevelop so early that\u0014\n                         it is not what most of us would think of as \na manageable\u0014\n                         choice any more than being born black, \nJewish or female\u0014\n                         is a manageable choice. What \ntraditionalists are asking,\u0014\n                         then, is for homosexuals to cut themselves \noff from an\u0014\n                         essential, natural part of who they are and \nfrom\u0014\n                         virtuesromantic love and the gift of sex in \na monogamous\u0014\n                         relationship, among other thingsmost \nbelievers think are\u0014\n                         part of a life lived in a godly way. And if \nscience now\u0014\n                         teaches us that being gay may be a natural \nstate, how\u0014\n                         can a reading of the Bible, including Saint \nPauls\u0014\n                         condemnation of same-sex interaction in \nRomans,\u0014\n                         inarguably cast homosexuality in unnatural \nterms?\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 There is more than a little irony at \nwork here, for the\u0014\n                         church has an ancient history with \nhomosexuals and with\u0014\n                         homosexual clergy. John Boswell, the late \nhistorian,\u0014\n                         observed that the church and its religious \norders long\u0014\n                         offered gay men and women a haven from \nmarried life.\u0014\n                         According to Donald B. Cozzenss The \nChanging Face of\u0014\n                         the Priesthood, misconduct has always been \nwith us, too.\u0014\n                         A second-century Gospel commentary says: \nThou shalt\u0014\n                         not seduce young boys. In the middle of the \n16th century,\u0014\n                         Pope Julius III plucked a 15-year-old boy \noff the streets and\u0014\n                         made him a cardinal and head of the \nVaticans Secretariat\u0014\n                         of State.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Nearly five centuries later, the \nreal issue in the current\u0014\n                         scandal is one of linkage. The evidence is \nthat\u0014\n                         homosexuals are no more likely to abuse \nchildren than\u0014\n                         heterosexuals. The great majority of cases \nnow before the\u0014\n                         church involve not pedophilia but \nephebophilia, an\u0014\n                         attraction to post-pubescent youths. \nPsychologists believe\u0014\n                         these instances do include abusers who are \nhomosexual,\u0014\n                         but that sexual orientation is only one \nfactor in their\u0014\n                         behavior. They most likely suffer from severe\u0014\n                         psychosexual problems, including emotional \nimmaturity. If\u0014\n                         you look at people who are psychologically \nforced to deny\u0014\n                         their sexual natures, experts say, you will \nlikely find a\u0014\n                         subset that will cross the line into abusive \nbehaviorin\u0014\n                         these cases with the young, who are often \nthe most\u0014\n                         available and malleable targets.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 This is not to excuse the abusers. \nBut blaming all\u0014\n                         homosexuals for the sins of a handful of \npathological\u0014\n                         people is like holding every heterosexual \naccountable for\u0014\n                         any pastor who goes after a teenage girl. \nBeing more open\u0014\n                         about sexual orientation might lead to less \nrepression, and\u0014\n                         less repressionfor heterosexuals and\u0014\n                         homosexualsmight well lead to a climate in \nwhich there is\u0014\n                         less destructive behavior. In the NEWSWEEK \nPoll, though\u0014\n                         more Catholics agree with the teaching that \nhomosexual\u0014\n                         acts are contrary to natural law (48 \npercent to 38\u0014\n                         percent), 61 percent do not believe \nhomosexuals are less\u0014\n                         able to control their sexual impulses than \nheterosexuals are\u0014\n                         to live a chaste, priestly life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Many branches of Christianity are \nnow pondering\u0014\n                         these things in their hearts. I dont think \nmost Catholics\u0014\n                         would care if their priest is straight or \ngay, to tell you the\u0014\n                         truth, says William Donohue, president of \nthe Catholic\u0014\n                         League. I think the issue for them is \nwhether he can live up\u0014\n                         to his vow of celibacy. Id take a chaste \ngay priest any day\u0014\n                         over a promiscuous straight one. But that \nraises a number\u0014\n                         of questions, too.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                         II. CELIBACY & MARRIAGE \u0014\n                                 True believers in clerical celibacy \nspeak of it in moving\u0014\n                         terms. Its not the easiest road in todays \ncrazy world,\u0014\n                         Cardinal Theodore McCarrick said in Rome, \nbut we...\u0014\n                         believe that if you practice celibacy and \nyou practice it with\u0014\n                         all your heart, with all your love, that you \ncan be free to\u0014\n                         serve Gods people and to serve God in such \na beautiful\u0014\n                         way. It is an ancient Catholic custom,  and \na noble one. \u0014\n                         But it is not as ancient as many\u0014\n                         people think, nor is it universaleither in \npractice or in\u0014\n                         doctrine. And it is costing the church. The \nranks of Catholic\u0014\n                         priests in the United States are dwindling, \ndown to 45,200\u0014\n                         in 2001 from 58,600 in 1965.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 To help explain the falloff, recall \nthe heady reformist\u0014\n                         atmosphere of the Second Vatican Council, \nwhich began\u0014\n                         when John XXIII summoned his bishops to Rome \nin 1962.\u0014\n                         The results were radical. Suddenly the \ncovenant of baptism\u0014\n                         had created a priesthood of the people and \nthe mass was\u0014\n                         said in the vernacular, closing the mystical \nliturgical\u0014\n                         distance between pastor and parishioner. It \nwas, in a way, a\u0014\n                         nod to democracy. Aspiring priests assumed \nthat a married\u0014\n                         clergy was the next step. As they came to \nsee how remote\u0014\n                         that change would be, many good priests left \nthe church to\u0014\n                         marry. Others simply continued to find \nsecretive ways to act\u0014\n                         on their sexual feelings. A. W. Richard \nSipe, a\u0014\n                         psychotherapist and former Catholic priest \nwho conducted\u0014\n                         a 25-year study of celibacy, sexuality and \nthe clergy,\u0014\n                         estimates that at any given time 50 percent \nof priestsno\u0014\n                         matter what their orientationare sexually \nactive in some\u0014\n                         way. Across all faiths, the most common \nstory is of the\u0014\n                         clergys seducing female parishioners. There \nis at least one\u0014\n                         support group for such women. \u0014\n\u0014\n                          In many traditions, marriage is viewed as a \ncentral part of a good\u0014\n                          religious life. We view the state of \nmarriage as being\u0014\n                          a very holy state of affairs, says Rabbi \nSteven M.  Dworken, executive vice\u0014\n                          president of the Rabbinical Council of \nAmerica.  Therefore, someone who\u0014\n                          is not marriedIm not saying theyre \nmissing\u0014\n                         something, thats too strongbut he is \nlacking in a\u0014\n                         completeness. Even from a sociological or \npsychological\u0014\n                         point of view, one would feel more \ncomfortable discussing\u0014\n                         marital problems or familial issues with \nsomeone you\u0014\n                         assume has shared some of those same \nexperiences.\u0014\n                         Many American Catholics are coming to the \nsame\u0014\n                         conclusion. Mary Louise Hartman, a lifelong \nCatholic from\u0014\n                         Princeton, N.J., was devastated when her \nassociate pastor\u0014\n                         fell in love and left the church to get \nmarried. One day we\u0014\n                         came to the church and the pastor read a \nletter and that\u0014\n                         was it, says Hartman, 60. I wish he could \nhave stayed as a\u0014\n                         married priest. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Historically, there is no lack of \nprecedent. Priests were\u0014\n                         married for Christianitys first thousand \nyears. Jesus\u0014\n                         Apostles had wives and families; Peter, whom \nRome claims\u0014\n                         as the founding pope, probably did, too. The \nforces that\u0014\n                         pushed the church toward its 12th-century \nstand on\u0014\n                         celibacy were political as well as \nspiritual, including the\u0014\n                         worry that sons of clergy would inherit \nchurch titles and\u0014\n                         property. As many as three popes may have \nhad sons\u0014\n                         succeed them to the Holy See. Those were \nbad times,\u0014\n                         says the Rev. Richard McBrien, who wrote a \nhistory of the\u0014\n                         papacy, and there needed to be a reform.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         So the clergy became celibate, but over the \ncenturies\u0014\n                         the idea did not spread very widely. (And \nthere were\u0014\n                         interludes like the pontificate of the \nlascivious Pope\u0014\n                         Alexander VI, who had several children.) \nNow, save for\u0014\n                         bishops in the Greek and Russian Orthodox \nchurches, no\u0014\n                         other major branch of Christianity (or \nJudaism) prohibits\u0014\n                         clergy from marrying. And Roman hierarchs \nhave on\u0014\n                         occasion chosen to make exceptions. There \nare thousands\u0014\n                         of Eastern Rite priests with wives and a \ntiny number of\u0014\n                         converted Episcopalian clergy who can bring \ntheir spouses\u0014\n                         along as they cross the Tiber.\u0014\n                       \u0014\n                                 John Paul II apparently refused to \ntalk about a more\u0014\n                         broadly married clergy with the Americans in \nRome. Here\u0014\n                         again, the suggestion of hypocrisy is hard \nto avoid. Some\u0014\n                         Vatican insiders think there is already a \nquasi-married\u0014\n                         clergy in some parts of the worldthey \nmention Africa,\u0014\n                         Latin America and Italywhere priests \nconduct long-term\u0014\n                         affairs. Someday, a Catholic sociologist \nprivately says,\u0014\n                         the church will wake up and realize that \nhalf of its priests\u0014\n                         are married. Hyperbolic, yes, but some \npriests are clearly\u0014\n                         choosing to interpret celibacy in a way that \nallows them to\u0014\n                         remain unmarried but not chaste. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Some Catholics object to openly \nmarried priests on\u0014\n                         the grounds that a family would prove a \ndistraction, or an\u0014\n                         expensive burden, or that the celebrant of \nthe mass should\u0014\n                         be ritually pure, wed only to God and his \nchurch. And, as\u0014\n                         Protestant experience shows, divorce can be \na problem,\u0014\n                         though most denominations seem to muddle \nthrough.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Gay marriageof laity and of \nclergyis another\u0014\n                         difficult front. More than 30 states refuse \nto recognize\u0014\n                         same-sex unions, and most branches of \nChristianity are\u0014\n                         wrestling with whether churches should \nsanction committed\u0014\n                         homosexual relationships. (One Protestant \nminister I know\u0014\n                         says: I dont have a problem with it, but I \nsure hope some\u0014\n                         other denomination jumps off that cliff \nfirst.) Interestingly,\u0014\n                         in the NEWSWEEK Poll, Catholics narrowly \noppose legally\u0014\n                         sanctioned gay marriages, 47 percent to 44 \npercent, but\u0014\n                         they are more liberal than non-Catholics, 61 \npercent of\u0014\n                         whom dont think such marriages are a good \nidea. The\u0014\n                         arguments against it run from adherence to \nthe\u0014\n                         conservative reading of Scripture to an \nabiding sense that\u0014\n                         the purpose of marriage from the Garden \nforward is\u0014\n                         procreation. This is a heartfelt position \nfor many, but you\u0014\n                         could argue it another way. Isnt the role \nof the church to\u0014\n                         encourage people to enter into stable \nrelationships? The\u0014\n                         purpose of marriage, or unions, or \nwhatever we want to\u0014\n                         call them, should be the establishment of a \ncommitted,\u0014\n                         loving family. Heterosexuals who do not \nproduce children\u0014\n                         are no less married. Meanwhile, Catholics \nin the United\u0014\n                         States are more likely than non-Catholics to \naccept a\u0014\n                         homosexual priest in a committed \nrelationship with\u0014\n                         someone of the same sex, 39 percent to 29 \npercent.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 More than a decade ago, Pullen \nMemorial Baptist\u0014\n                         Church in Raleigh, N.C., was expelled from \nthe Southern\u0014\n                         Baptist Convention when it voted to support \na pastor who\u0014\n                         wanted to bless the union of two men. It \nseemed to me that\u0014\n                         our society makes it so difficult for gays \nand lesbians to be\u0014\n                         responsible with their sexuality by not \nsupporting those who\u0014\n                         want covenant relationships, says the Rev. \nMahan Siler,\u0014\n                         the 67-year-old retired pastor who asked \nPullen for\u0014\n                         permission to perform the service. He has a \ngood point.\u0014\n                         Weve changed the definition of marriage \nbefore, both to\u0014\n                         liberate women from being legal property and \nto allow\u0014\n                         people of different races to marry. Such an \napproach\u0014\n                         should encourage monogamy and bring \nhomosexuals into\u0014\n                         the fuller life of the community.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Many people would probably agree with a \nremark\u0014\n                         attributed to Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the \nEnglish actress,\u0014\n                         who once said: It doesnt matter what you \ndo in the\u0014\n                         bedroom as long as you dont do it in the \nstreet and\u0014\n                         frighten the horses. No one should have \nthings forced on\u0014\n                         them by reformers for showy or \nconfrontational reasons.\u0014\n                         Discipline and dignity are important. \nRemoving barriers tied\u0014\n                         to sexuality, either for celibate \nheterosexuals or celibate\u0014\n                         homosexuals, is not an invitation to turn a \ncommunity of\u0014\n                         faith into a singles scene. Here is a \npossible covenant: if\u0014\n                         some of the more obvious doors are opened, \nthe minister\u0014\n                         owes it to the congregation (and, not to be \ntoo grand about\u0014\n                         it, to God) to conduct himself (or herself, \nin the faiths that\u0014\n                         ordain women) with grace and dis\u0014",

Still, \nresearch suggests\u0014\n                         homosexuals are just as good at raising kids \nas\u0014\n                         heterosexuals. (In the NEWSWEEK Poll, 46 \npercent of the\u0014\n                         public and 56 percent of Catholics support \nallowing gays\u0014\n                         and lesbians to adopt children.) The \nChristian answer to\u0014\n                         the changing nature of the American family \nmay be a\u0014\n                         willingness to accept different kinds of \nhouseholds as long\u0014\n                         as children are protected and nurturednot a \nbad goal for\u0014\n                         any of us.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                         III. FACTORING IN FEMALES\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Garry Wills, an observant liberal \nCatholic,  thinks the gay question will\u0014\n                         produce reformjust not  for homosexuals. \nThe higher salience of gays in\u0014\n                         seminaries has led some homophobic men to \navoid entering seminaries or to\u0014\n                         withdraw from them, Wills wrote in his book \nPapal Sin.\u0014\n                                                         \u0014\n                                 In fact, the admission of married \nmen and women to the priesthoodwhich is\u0014\n                         bound to come anywaymay well come for the \nwrong reason, not\u0014\n                         because women and the  community deserve \nthis, but because of panic at the\u0014\n                         perception the priesthood is becoming \npredominantly gay. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 In all the conversations about the \nfuture of the faith,\u0014\n                         womens ordination has gotten surprisingly \nlittle attention.\u0014\n                         The pope does not want to talk about it; the \ncardinal\u0014\n                         archbishop of Los Angeles said he would \nraise the issue in\u0014\n                         Rome but appears to have backed down. John \nPaul II has\u0014\n                         more company on this than on a celibate \npriesthood. The\u0014\n                         Orthodox do not ordain women; Southern \nBaptist churches\u0014\n                         rarely do, either. Traditionalists argue \nthat Jesus was a\u0014\n                         man and did not include any women among the \nApostles.\u0014\n                         This is a familiar but not especially \nconvincing point. Rome,\u0014\n                         for example, does not apply the Apostle test \nto clerical\u0014\n                         marriage, and, as Wills wryly asks, does \nfaithful adherence\u0014\n                         to the literal original band mean all \npriests have to be\u0014\n                         Jews? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The case for an all-male priesthood \nis deeper and\u0014\n                         more complex. Maleness and femaleness are \nnot\u0014\n                         accidents of biology; they are icons and \nwindows into Gods\u0014\n                         purposes in the world, says George Weigel. \nIn the\u0014\n                         Catholic understanding, the priest makes \npresent in his\u0014\n                         person the eternal priesthood of Jesus \nChrist, who,\u0014\n                         according to Saint Paul in Ephesians, gives \nhimself\u0014\n                         completely to his bride, the church. But the \nidea that this is\u0014\n                         a debasement of women is just wrongthe \nhighest,\u0014\n                         unsurpassable figure in the communion of \nsaints, the first\u0014\n                         Christian, is Mary, who is not a priest and \nwho has higher\u0014\n                         powers. This is a lot more complicated and \ninteresting than\u0014\n                         contemporary gender politics would have you \nbelieve. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Yet many modern Catholics do not \nthink Jesus\u0014\n                         incarnation as a man means that those who \nare alteri\u0014\n                         Christiother Christs, or ordained \npriestsmust also be\u0014\n                         men. They hold that the priesthood is a \nlogical extension of\u0014\n                         the principle that through the gift of \nbaptism both men and\u0014\n                         women have a place at the Lords table as \npriests.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Opening the door to female priests \ncould provide a\u0014\n                         fresh stream of talent at a time when the \nchurch is having\u0014\n                         trouble keeping its candles burning. And a \nclerical class\u0014\n                         that included women might help male priests, \ncelibate or\u0014\n                         not, married or not, gay or not, live in a \nworld more like the\u0014\n                         one the rest of us inhabit. The abuse \nscandal has\u0014\n                         underscored the priesthoods susceptibility \nto insularity and\u0014\n                         arrogance. A more diverse pool could let a \nbit more light\u0014\n                         into the sacristy, and having women as \ncolleagues would\u0014\n                         psychologically benefit the men of the \ncloth. Right now\u0014\n                         many of their relationships with women are \neither those of\u0014\n                         dependence (strong mothers or the powerful \nladies of the\u0014\n                         parish who adopt them) or, in darker \nmoments, of furtive\u0014\n                         sexual contacts. Female peers might teach \nthem things\u0014\n                         about themselves and others they would not \nhave thought\u0014\n                         of, making them fuller people and probably \nbetter pastors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The Protestant experience has been \nmixed, but the\u0014\n                         apocalypse many predicted in the beginning \nhas yet to\u0014\n                         materialize. It took some getting used to, \nand I think it\u0014\n                         continues to take some getting used to, \nsays the Rev.\u0014\n                         Marion Jackson, who works at the United \nMethodists board\u0014\n                         of ministry, which officially began \nordaining women in 1956.\u0014\n                         Whenever a church receives its first woman \npastor, they\u0014\n                         are concerned about whether or not a woman \ncan do the\u0014\n                         job. And it takes their living together for \na while for\u0014\n                         congregations to accept the woman after \nshes been there\u0014\n                         and done a good job. Its like, What were \nwe so concerned\u0014\n                         about?  (For what its worth, the vast \nmajority of cases of\u0014\n                         sexual abuse, with either children or teens, \nare committed\u0014\n                         by adult mennot adult women.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 There are some churchgoers who remain\u0014\n                         uncomfortable about the change, and there \nprobably\u0014\n                         always will be. I know a number of such \nconservatives, both\u0014\n                         in the South and in the Northeast, and they \nhave honest\u0014\n                         reservations about breaking with tradition. \nOften the only\u0014\n                         thing that leads them to make peace with a \nwoman at the\u0014\n                         altar is getting to know one good female \npriest. Believers\u0014\n                         are frequently against things in principle \nthat they find\u0014\n                         congenial in practice. My wife comes from a \ncounty in the\u0014\n                         Mississippi Delta, the heart of the formerly \nsegregated\u0014\n                         South, where, happily for both priest and \nparish, one\u0014\n                         Episcopal church is presided over by a woman \nand the\u0014\n                         other by a man from Ugandaan unthinkable \nsituation only\u0014\n                         a generation ago. Some people might call \nthat a cave, or a\u0014\n                         compromise. Others call it the Holy Ghost.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Churches are not really \ndemocraciesRome\u0014\n                         especiallyand the Vatican wont hear of \nfactoring in\u0014\n                         females. Donald Cozzens quotes this gloomy \nprognosis\u0014\n                         from a retired vicar-general: The shortage \nof priests is not\u0014\n                         going to be solved by praying for more \nvocations. Women\u0014\n                         are the ones who identify and nurture \nvocations, and they\u0014\n                         are not doing it anymore, and they are not \ngoing to do it,\u0014\n                         and all the preaching in the world is not \ngoing to change\u0014\n                         their minds. If you dont believe me, talk \nto them. Ive\u0014\n                         interviewed them. They say, A church that \nwont accept my\u0014\n                         daughters isnt going to get my son.\u0014\n                                 \u0014\n                         IV. THE NEXT MISSION \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Pope John Paul II acknowledged the \nseverity of the problem of\u0014\n                         sexual abuse among Catholic priests, but no \npolicy has yet been\u0014\n                         enacted.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 How can we start a calm, intelligent \nconversation that\u0014\n                         treats normal sexualityof any kindnot as \nsomething\u0014\n                         apart but as a piece of the tapestry of our \nlives, no more or\u0014\n                         less important, really, than other essential \nelements of who\u0014\n                         we areour sense of right and wrong, our \ncapacity to\u0014\n                         reason? Inevitably it will happen only from \nfaith to faith,\u0014\n                         parish to parish, even nation to nation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 On the traditional side there is the \nMunich analogy:\u0014\n                         that to relax one standard or erase one line \nmeans\u0014\n                         ultimately there will be no standards and no \nlines. But\u0014\n                         serious people and serious institutions can \nmake\u0014\n                         distinctions and judgments. And it may be \nnecessary to\u0014\n                         broaden some lines of tolerance in order to \ndraw other\u0014\n                         lines as to what is and what is not \nacceptable behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 There is no question but that any \nattempt to seduce\u0014\n                         minors, of any age, should be forbidden and \npunished with\u0014\n                         force. There can be no room for predatorsa \nlesson that\u0014\n                         seems to have taken an insular Catholic \nelite too long to\u0014\n                         recognize. I want someone as a priest whos \nhonest with us\u0014\n                         and with himself, says Anne Barrett Doyle, \nan editor and\u0014\n                         Catholic mother of four from a Boston \nsuburb. Someone\u0014\n                         who doesnt get swept up in the power of \nbeing a priest...\u0014\n                         A lot of American Catholicstrue, only 6 \npercent of the\u0014\n                         global faiths flock but an important source \nof financial\u0014\n                         supportshare her wish about the nature of a \npriest. So do\u0014\n                         a lot of Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The more radical energy is, to be \nsure, coming from\u0014\n                         America. In other parts of the world, some \nChristian faiths\u0014\n                         worry their richer, more liberal American \nfellow believers\u0014\n                         may go too far. If you look at churches \naround the world,\u0014\n                         says the historian Philip Jenkins, there is \nno correlation\u0014\n                         between democratized theological stands and \nnumerical\u0014\n                         success. In fact, the ones that are booming \ncan be\u0014\n                         downright reactionary. In Africa, Asia and \nLatin America,\u0014\n                         clear-cut doctrine is appealing. Of course \nthe leadership of\u0014\n                         the Catholic Church is conservative, says \nJenkins. They\u0014\n                         can count.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 An excellent point. Its not a time \nfor anything goes;\u0014\n                         the occasion for the discussion, the \nscandal, shows that.\u0014\n                         But it is a time to end hypocrisy. The \nresult may be a little\u0014\n                         change, or radical change, or none at all. \nSome branches\u0014\n                         of the family may not be able to ordain an \nopen\u0014\n                         homosexual, or tolerate a woman at the altar.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 History, though, suggests that the \nmore sorts and\u0014\n                         conditions of menan old Anglican phrasewe \nallow into\u0014\n                         the mainstream, the truer we are to the \ncommandment to\u0014\n                         love one another as Christ loved us. (In \nsecular American\u0014\n                         terms, its also the way we live up to the \npromise of the\u0014\n                         Founding, that all men are created equal.) \nTo take issues\u0014\n                         off the table runs awfully close to the sin \nof pride. A\u0014\n                         reassuring Biblical refrain seems \nappropriate: Be not\u0014\n                         afraid. Lets have the debate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Churches can, after all, change \ntheir minds about\u0014\n                         things that once seemed sure and certain. In \nthe 17th\u0014\n                         century, Pope Paul V condemned Galileo for \narguing in\u0014\n                         favor of the Copernican notion that the \nEarth was not the\u0014\n                         center of the universe. The vision of the \nplanets circling\u0014\n                         the sun was contrary to the churchs \nteaching, which was in\u0014\n                         turn based partly on an interpretation of \nScripture. Nearly\u0014\n                         350 years later, John Paul II commissioned a \nserious,\u0014\n                         searching study of the case and determined \nthe church\u0014\n                         had made a mistake. It was a brave and \nintellectually\u0014\n                         honest thing to do, and indicates that with \nleadership there\u0014\n                         is always room for discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Asking the hard questions, even \nabout our most basic\u0014\n                         assumptions, is to be true to our origins. \nChristianity was\u0014\n                         never supposed to be easy. The \ncontradictions in Jesus\u0014\n                         legacy are thick, and epic. In defeat there \nis victory; in\u0014\n                         humility, strength; in surrender, gain; in \ndarkness, light. All\u0014\n                         counterintuitive ideas, and all promise \nreward later, not\u0014\n                         nowbeyond time and space. It is not a creed \nof comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 And yet countless men and women, of \nevery color and\u0014\n                         nationality, in huts and cathedrals, kneel \nbefore the cross\u0014\n                         every day, believing they are part of a \ndivine drama, linked,\u0014\n                         in the words of the mass, to angels and \narchangels and all\u0014\n                         the company of heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 As the faithful struggle to do \nright, to make the\u0014\n                         sacraments available to all, we will make \nmistakes, come up\u0014\n                         short, throw out things we should keep and \nkeep things we\u0014\n                         should throw out. But the price of the \njourney, however\u0014\n                         steep, is worth paying, for in the Christian \nimagination the\u0014\n                         ultimate sacrifice has already been made. \nBe of good\u0014\n                         cheer, Jesus says, for I have overcome the \nworld.

    "words": "SEATTLE SLEW DIES \nAT 28 IN HIS SLEEP             \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n        LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple \nCrown and became one\u0014\n        of racing's greatest sires, died in his stall Tuesday at the \nrelatively advanced age of 28.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The big, black stallion's death came on the 25th anniversary \nof his Kentucky Derby victory.\u0014\n        He followed by winning the Preakness Stakes and Belmont \nStakes to sweep the sport's\u0014\n        most prestigious series.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Seattle Slew was the only living Triple Crown winner. \nAffirmed, who became the 11th and \u0014\n        last Triple Crown winner in 1978, died in January 2001 at 26.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew died in his sleep at Hill 'n' Dale Farm, where \nhe recently was moved after a\u0014\n                  second operation on his spine, the farm said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ``He was the most complete thoroughbred the \nindustry has seen. He just kept raising\u0014\n                  the bar with every record he broke,'' owner Mickey \nTaylor said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew, who won 14 of 17 races and earned $1,208,726, \nhad been ailing the past two\u0014\n                  years with arthritis and underwent two delicate \nspinal fusion operations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Last month, Slew was a bit wobbly after the second \nsurgery, which was to\u0014\n                  ``normalize,'' him, Taylor said. The first one, the \nowner said last month during an\u0014\n                  interview, ``saved his life.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Bought for a bargain-basement $17,500 by Taylor, a \nformer lumberman from\u0014\n                  Washington, and former partner, Jim Hill, Slew \nsired 102 stakes winners. They\u0014\n                  include 1984 Kentucky Derby winner Swale, A.P. \nIndy, Capote and Slew o' Gold, and\u0014\n                  have earned more than $75 million in purses.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Taylor, who moved to Lexington two years ago with \nhis wife, Karen, to be near\u0014\n                  Slew, was with the horse when he was pronounced \ndead. Slew spent his years of\u0014\n                  retirement at Spendthrift Farm, then spent the last \n17 years at Three Chimneys in\u0014\n                  Midway, Ky., before arriving at Hill 'n' Dale on \nApril 1.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew will be buried beneath a statue in a courtyard \nat Hill 'n' Dale, a 319-acre farm\u0014\n                  near Keeneland.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ``He had the greatest heart. He was a fighter to \nthe end,'' Karen Taylor said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew was moved to the quieter farm because he was \ntoo close to the breeding shed\u0014\n                  and it caused him to become agitated when mares \narrived, Mickey Taylor said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In an interview last week with The Associated \nPress, Slew's trainer Billy Turner\u0014\n                  called the colt one of the toughest to hit the race \ntrack.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ``I knew I had a horse who was different from the \nrest,'' Turner said. ``I knew when\u0014\n                  you see a horse go that fast with no effort, that's \ndifferent. He was a good student\u0014\n                  with tremendous energy and phenomenal ability. All \nI had to do was control it. ... He\u0014\n                  had blinding speed and burning determination. My \njob was to get him to accept\u0014\n                  competition and other horses.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew's retirement in 1978 at age 4 seemed \npremature, but his career as a stallion\u0014\n                  was infinitely more lucrative. The Taylors made a \nfortune breeding Slew, earning\u0014\n                  fees well over $100,000 per mare. After Slew's \nfirst surgery, he was pulled from\u0014\n                  the breeding line, but he was back in business last \nyear, with 43 of 46 mares in foal.\u0014\n                  His last breeding session was Feb. 23.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Mickey Taylor described Slew's walk recently, \nsaying: ``He looks like a crab, a bad\u0014\n                  crab,'' when his front legs go one way and his hind \nlegs another.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  But he sure could run in his heyday. He won his \nfirst six races and had never trailed\u0014\n                  heading to the Derby. When the gates opened for the \nDerby, Slew smacked the gate\u0014\n                  and slammed into a horse next to him. Ridden by \nJean Cruguet, Slew regained his\u0014\n                  stride and by the time the field hit the first \nturn, he was well on his way to a 1\u0014\n                  3/4-length victory.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the Preakness Stakes, he was briefly second \nearly on, but won by 1 1/2 lengths.\u0014\n                  The Belmont was a start-to-finish celebration, with \nCruguet standing in the irons and\u0014\n                  pointing his whip skyward just before Slew crossed \nthe finish line four lengths in\u0014\n                  front.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ``He was the fastest horse I ever rode,'' Cruguet \nsaid last month. ``Maybe not the\u0014\n                  greatest, but he was a speed demon. Wouldn't let \nanyone ahead of him. He was a\u0014\n                  miler, but had great heart to finish first no \nmatter what the distance.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                  At 4, Slew had a new rider in Angel Cordero and new \ntrainer in Doug Peterson. He\u0014\n                  also went out in style, beating Affirmed in the '78 \nMarlboro Cup at Belmont Park and\u0014\n                  capping his career with a victory in the Stuyvesant \nHandicap at Aqueduct.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Hill 'n' Dale owner John Sikura was proud to have \nSlew at his farm.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  ``It was one of the great privileges to be around \nsomething great, a feeling that will\u0014\n                  likely never be duplicated,'' he said. ``He was one \nin a million, and showed us there\u0014\n                  is that possibility in a game of impossibilities.''\u0014",

    "words": "NEW YORK TIMES 05-11-02 \u0014\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company \u0014\nSo God's Really in the Details?\u0014\nBy EMILY EAKIN\u0014\nEconomists use probability theory to make forecasts about consumer \nspending. Actuaries use it to calculate insurance premiums. Last \nmonth, Richard Swinburne, a professor of philosophy at Oxford \nUniversity, put it to work toward less mundane ends: he invoked it to \ndefend the belief that Jesus was resurrected from the dead. \u0014\n\"For someone dead for 36 hours to come to life again is, according to \nthe laws of nature, extremely improbable,\" Mr. Swinburne told an \naudience of more than 100 philosophers who had convened at Yale \nUniversity in April for a conference on ethics and belief. \"But if \nthere is a God of the traditional kind, natural laws only operate \nbecause he makes them operate.\" \u0014\nMr. Swinburne, a commanding figure with snow-white hair and piercing \nblue eyes, proceeded to weigh evidence for and against the \nResurrection, assigning values to factors like the probability that \nthere is a God, the nature of Jesus' behavior during his lifetime and \nthe quality of witness testimony after his death. Then, while his \naudience followed along on printed lecture notes, he plugged his \nnumbers into a dense thicket of letters and symbols  using a \nprobability formula known as Bayes's theorem  and did the math. \n\"Given e and k, h is true if and only if c is true,\" he said. \"The \nprobability of h given e and k is .97\" \u0014\nIn plain English, this means that, by Mr. Swinburne's calculations, \nthe probability of the Resurrection comes out to be a whopping 97 \npercent. \u0014\nWhile his highly technical lectures may not net Christianity many \nfresh converts, Mr. Swinburne's efforts to bring inductive logic to \nbear on questions of faith have earned him a considerable reputation \nin the small but vibrant world of Christian academic philosophy. \nThanks to the efforts of Mr. Swinburne and a handful of other nimble \nscholarly minds  including Alvin Plantinga at the University of \nNotre Dame and Nicholas Wolterstorff at Yale  religious belief no \nlonger languishes in a state of philosophical disrepute. Deploying a \nrange of sophisticated logical arguments developed over the last 25 \nyears, Christian philosophers have revived faith as a subject of \nrigorous academic debate, steadily chipping away at the assumption  \nall but axiomatic in philosophy since the Enlightenment  that belief \nin God is logically indefensible. \u0014\n\"They are the first group within 20th-century Anglo-American \nphilosophy to tackle questions of religious faith using the tools of \nphilosophy,\" said Brian Leiter, a professor of law and philosophy at \nthe University of Texas at Austin and editor of the Philosophical \nGourmet Report, which ranks academic philosophy departments. \"It \nwould be accurate to say that it's a growth movement.\" \u0014\nMr. Wolterstorff, who retired from Yale in December and in whose \nhonor the conference was organized, agreed. \"And it's not just \ngraybeards,\" he added, referring to the dozens of younger scholars \nand graduate students in attendance. \"Within the general discipline, \nthis development of the philosophy of religion has been \nextraordinary.\" \u0014\nTo be sure, not all of the movement's philosophers agree with one \nanother, use the same tactics or even hold the same religious \nbeliefs. Some, including Mr. Swinburne, for example, are what's known \nas evidentialists: they accept the Enlightenment doctrine that a \nbelief is justified only when evidence can be found for it outside \nthe believer's own mind. According to the classic evidentialist \nargument, for faith to be considered rational it has to be supported \nby independent proof, and there simply isn't any. (Asked what he \nwould say if God appeared to him after his death and demanded to know \nwhy he had failed to believe, the British philosopher and staunch \nevidentialist Bertrand Russell replied that he would say, \"Not enough \nevidence, God! Not enough evidence.\")\u0014\nIn \"The Existence of God\" (Oxford University Press, 1979), Mr. \nSwinburne, a Greek Orthodox Christian, tried to meet the \nevidentialist challenge using Bayes's theorem. Supplying pages of \nintricate, technical argumentation to back up his claims, he wrote \nthat many natural phenomena  including the universe itself  are, \nwell, if not incontrovertible proof of God's handiwork, at least \n\"more probable if there is a God than if there is not.\" (Mr. \nSwinburne, it turns out, is not the first to enlist Bayes's theorem \nin defense of religion. In a 1763 paper presented to the British \nRoyal Society, the minister Richard Price used it to show there was \ngood evidence in favor of the miracles described in the New \nTestament.)\u0014\nMore influential at the moment, however, are the \"reformed \nepistemologists\" led by Mr. Plantinga and Mr. Wolterstorff, who are \nCalvinists. These scholars reject the evidentialist insistence on \nindependent proofs. After all, they point out, the ability to \ndistinguish good evidence from bad requires reason, but why trust our \nability to reason? Where's the proof that our reason is any good? For \nthe evidentialists, reason is considered a \"basic belief,\" one that \ndoesn't require additional evidence to be true. But if reason can be \nconsidered a basic belief, then so, too, say the reformed \nepistemologists, can faith in God. \u0014\nAccepting faith as a basic belief, they say, does not make faith \nirrational. On the contrary, they insist, a belief can lack \nindependent evidence and still be rational. Some beliefs are simply \nself-evident. Most people know that 1 + 1 = 2, Mr. Wolterstorff \npoints out, just as they accept beliefs about their bodily state  \nlike \"I feel dizzy\"  without having to consult other sources. \"We \nbelieve lots of things that don't have publicly formulated \narguments,\" Mr. Wolterstorff said. \"Reformed epistemology challenges \nthe need for arguments.\"\u0014\nTo buttress their case, the reformed epistemologists lean on Thomas \nReid, an 18th-century Scottish \"common sense\" philosopher, who, \narguing that many legitimate beliefs are simply instinctual, \ncomplained: \"Are we to admit nothing but can be proved by reason?\" \u0014\nBut despite their intricate arguments, some critics  including \nChristians  worry that reformed epistemologists make it far too easy \nto justify any belief, no matter how absurd. Mr. Plantinga calls this \nthe Great Pumpkin Objection. As he stated the problem in a seminal \n1983 essay, \"Reason and Belief in God\": \"If belief in God is properly \nbasic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? What about \nvoodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin \nreturns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic?\" \u0014\nThe answer, as you'd expect, is \"certainly not.\" But explaining why \nturns out to be a formidable challenge. Mr. Plantinga has devoted \nthree thick volumes and the last 20 years to the effort, stressing, \namong other things, that for a belief to be justified, it must be \nheld by a person whose mental faculties are functioning properly. \u0014\nMore aggressively, he has suggested that our capacity for true \nbeliefs is proof that a divine creator  rather than Darwinian \nnatural selection  is behind evolution: if human beings evolved by \nrandom process from mentally primitive creatures, how could we be \nsure that any of our beliefs  including our belief in evolution  \nare true? \u0014\nAt the Yale conference, however, neither Darwin nor the Great Pumpkin \nObjection seemed any more pressing than conundrums that have dogged \nChristianity far longer  occasionally giving the event the aura of a \nmedieval synod. If God is omnipotent and wholly good, why does he \npermit evil to occur? the philosophers wondered. And if God \nultimately decides what happens in the world, in what sense can human \nbeings be said to have free will? \u0014\nMr. Swinburne also came in for his share of questions. \"Bayes's \ntheorem provides a model of learning from experience,\" one \nphilosopher observed. \"As time goes by, it seems you would accumulate \nmore evidence against the Resurrection because the expected Second \nComing doesn't occur.\"\u0014\nMr. Swinburne acknowledged the point was worth considering. But he \nwasn't about to concede it entirely. When Jesus spoke about the \nSecond Coming, \"he might have said soon but he certainly didn't say \nwhen,\" Mr. Swinburne insisted, adding, \"I don't think you have a very \nstrong case there.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Slew in the Breeding Shed: Passing on his Greatness\u0014\n                  by David Schmitz\u0014\n                  Date Posted: 5/14/02 3:24:12 PM\u0014\n                  Last Updated: 5/15/02 11:49:42 AM\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Published in the May 18 issue of The Blood-Horse\u0014\n                  The odds of a horse becoming a champion are huge. \nSo are the odds of a horse becoming a\u0014\n                  prominent stallion. Now, imagine the odds of a \nhorse becoming a great champion and a great\u0014\n                  stallion. Now, take it to its maximum. Imagine the \nodds of a horse becoming a truly great champion\u0014\n                  and stallion. It was those odds, which Seattle Slew \nbeat on both the racetrack and at stud in such\u0014\n                  a commanding way, that made him such a legend. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew didn't miss a beat going from the \nracetrack to stallion service. His contribution to a\u0014\n                  pedigree was varied. Varied in regard to what a \nbreeder needed. If a breeder wanted speed,\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew was near the top of the list in \nproviding that valuable attribute. Stamina. Same thing.\u0014\n                  Soundness. Same thing. There wasn't much Slew \ncouldn't deliver to a pedigree. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew's first crop yielded champions \nLandaluce and Slew o' Gold; his second a Kentucky\u0014\n                  Derby (gr. I) winner in Swale; and a later one \nHorse of the Year and leading sire in A.P. Indy.\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew, Slew o' Gold, and A.P. Indy are \nmembers of the National Museum of Racing's Hall of\u0014\n                  Fame and scheduled for induction this year is \nSeattle Slew's maternal grandson Cigar. Overall,\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew has sired 102 stakes winners, \nincluding 28 grade/group I winners, and achieved as\u0014\n                  much fame with his sons at stud as with his \ndaughters as broodmares. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Bred in Kentucky by Ben Castleman, Seattle Slew \nbegan his stallion career at Leslie Combs II's\u0014\n                  Spendthrift Farm near Lexington. Combs' son, \nBrownell Combs II, had arranged Seattle Slew's\u0014\n                  syndication. The deal was announced in the winter \nof Seattle Slew's 4-year-old season in 1978\u0014\n                  and called for the son of Bold Reasoning to be \nsyndicated into 40 shares. Combs, in partnership\u0014\n                  with George Layman Jr. of Washington state and \nFranklin Groves of Minnesota, purchased 20\u0014\n                  shares at $300,000 each for a total of $6 million. \nThe Taylors and Hills owned the remaining 20\u0014\n                  shares, making the $12-million syndication price \nthe richest at the time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew arrived at Spendthrift that fall. His \nwelcome was what you'd expect for a Triple\u0014\n                  Crown winner. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Governor Julian Carroll was there, and we had a \n'Welcome Home, Champ' banner at the farm,\"\u0014\n                  said John Williams, who managed Spendthrift from \n1976-84. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The farm spared no expense in providing for the \nchamp's safety. \"We put in a highly sophisticated\u0014\n                  security system,\" Williams said. \"We had a TV in \nhis stall and his paddock, like the ones they have\u0014\n                  in banks.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Williams also came up with a plan to ensure Seattle \nSlew's fitness. \"I thought it would be a good\u0014\n                  idea to gallop him regularly,\" he said about a \npractice that was employed until Slew was in his 20s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As good as things looked, all was not going well. \n\"He was just not interested in breeding,\" Williams\u0014\n                  said. \"I called Mickey and told him we were going \nto try something different, and he said he had\u0014\n                  complete faith in us. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Working with Clem Brooks, who handled Nashua and \nprobably was the greatest stud groom of all\u0014\n                  time, we worked out a program whereby we would lead \ntwo or three mares into the breeding\u0014\n                  shed, and have Slew pick out which one he wanted. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"At times, we bred Slew to mares outside--in the \nsnow, rain, wherever he wanted. It was never\u0014\n                  the same. That went on for two years. Even with \nthose difficulties, he was an extremely fertile\u0014\n                  stallion, getting 90-plus percent of his mares in \nfoal.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slewpy was Seattle Slew's initial winner, but \nLandaluce was his first big winner. A 2-year-old in\u0014\n                  1982, she shook the racing world with a clocking of \n1:08 1/5 for six furlongs at Hollywood Park,\u0014\n                  then won the Hollywood Lassie Stakes (gr. II) in \n1:08 flat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"If you watch a tape of the stakes and freeze it at \nthe quarter pole, there are four fillies lapped on\u0014\n                  her. It looked like anybody's race,\" said D. Wayne \nLukas, who trained the filly. \"After that, she was\u0014\n                  gone. Won by 21 lengths. They later named the race \nin her honor.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Landaluce won three more stakes before dying that \nfall from a bacterial infection. She was\u0014\n                  champion 2-year-old filly and just missed Horse of \nthe Year honors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Slew o' Gold was a champion at three and four. \nTrained at four by John Hertler, Slew o' Gold won\u0014\n                  the 1984 New York Fall Championship Series, \nconsisting of the Woodward Stakes, Marlboro Cup\u0014\n                  Handicap, and Jockey Club Gold Cup, all grade I. \nBut it was Slew o' Gold's win in the Whitney\u0014\n                  Handicap (gr. I) over just two rivals at Saratoga \nthat most impressed Hertler. \"He won with so\u0014\n                  much ease he could have beaten anyone that day,\" \nthe trainer said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  In 1985, Seattle Slew's stud fee shot up to \n$800,000, and his yearling half-brother, a colt by\u0014\n                  Nijinsky II, was sold for a record $13.1 million at \nthe Keeneland July sale. Seattle Slew was\u0014\n                  relocated that fall to Robert Clay's Three Chimneys \nFarm near Midway, Ky., where he stood until he\u0014\n                  was moved to John Sikura's Hill 'n' Dale Farm near \nLexington this spring. Several years after\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew's arrival at Three Chimneys, his \nchampion son Capote began his stallion career there.\u0014\n                  Capote's offspring include champion Boston Harbor \nand 39 other stakes winners. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Swale was bred by the Hancock family's Claiborne \nFarm, the same Paris, Ky., farm where Seattle\u0014\n                  Slew was conceived. Swale won the 1984 Kentucky \nDerby and Belmont Stakes (gr. I) but died\u0014\n                  eight days after the latter race. He was champion \n3-year-old male. Seattle Slew that year led the\u0014\n                  general sire list with $5,524,911 in progeny \nearnings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Swale and Slew o' Gold were registered as being \nbred by Claiborne, but both horses are products\u0014\n                  of a foal-sharing arrangement between Claiborne and \na partnership involving the Taylors and Hills.\u0014\n                  The Hills and Taylors formed several partnerships \nfor the purpose of racing and breeding Seattle\u0014\n                  Slew's offspring. One of the outfits, Seminole \nSyndicate, is the breeder of Seattle Slew's grade I\u0014\n                  winners Slew the Dragon and Slewpy and the \nco-breeder of grade I winner Life At the Top. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  A.P. Indy won the 1992 Belmont and clinched Horse \nof the Year honors with a victory in that\u0014\n                  year's Breeders' Cup Classic (gr. I). He stands at \nstud at William S. Farish's Lane's End Farm near\u0014\n                  Versailles, Ky. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms bred and raced \nthree of Seattle Slew's grade I winners--Flute,\u0014\n                  Honest Lady, and Sleep Easy--and all three \nexhibited different styles as racemares, according to\u0014\n                  trainer Bobby Frankel. \"Flute was a long distance \nfilly who was gentle like a pet,\" he said. \"She\u0014\n                  was careful not to hurt you when you were around \nher. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Honest Lady had a good turn of foot, a sprinter, \nbut was hard to train in the beginning. Sleep Easy\u0014\n                  was a surprise. We didn't expect much from her in \nthe beginning.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Seattle Slew's most recent champion, Surfside, also \nwas trained by Lukas, who conditioned eight\u0014\n                  of the stallion's grade I winners. Surfside \nclinched her championship by way of a victory over\u0014\n                  males in the 2000 Clark Handicap (gr. II) after \nrunning second in the Breeders' Cup Distaff (gr. I). \u0014\n\u0014\n                               Copyright  2002 The Blood-Horse, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\u0014",

Rodman Williams | One of the most \ninfluential and controversial\u0014\n                      events in the twentieth-century American church \nwas the\u0014\n                      emergence of the charismatic movement. With its \nemphasis on\u0014\n                      the gifts of the Spirit, the movement brought \nelements of\u0014\n                      Pentecostalism to non-Pentecostal churches. By \nthe early\u0014\n                      1960s, Catholics, mainline churches, and many\u0014\n                      non-Pentecostal evangelicals were experiencing \nthe power of\u0014\n                      the Holy Spirit through prophecies, divine \nhealings, speaking in\u0014\n                      tongues, and various physical phenomena. The \nmovement\u0014\n                      generated much debate about the purpose of \nthese gifts and\u0014\n                      experiences in the Christian life. Were they \nlegitimate\u0014\n                      expressions of worship, or just frenzied \nspiritual emotionalism?\u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Today, evangelicals seem to \nhave made\u0014\n                                       peace with the charismatic \nmovement,\u0014\n                                       embracing many of its \npractices and\u0014\n                                       agreeing to disagree on \nothers. Indeed,\u0014\n                                       it's not strange these days to \nfind people\u0014\n                                       lifting their hands in the \nmost conservative\u0014\n                                       of evangelical functions. \nDespite this\u0014\n                                       evolution, many questions \nremain about\u0014\n                                       the meaning of speaking in \ntongues.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The phenomenon of tongues (or glossolalia) is \nidentified by\u0014\n                      many as the supernatural utterance of foreign \nhuman\u0014\n                      languages (Acts 2:4,6); others contend that it \nincludes speaking\u0014\n                      an angelic language (1 Cor. 13:1) or some other \nverbal\u0014\n                      expression requiring interpretation (1 Cor. \n14). For many years,\u0014\n                      speaking in tongues was seen as the \ndistinguishing\u0014\n                      characteristic of the Pentecostal and \ncharismatic traditions\u0014\n                      within the church. Some Pentecostal Christians, \nin particular,\u0014\n                      laid heavy emphasis on speaking in tongues as \n\"initial\u0014\n                      evidence\" of baptism in the Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That there was some connection in the \nscriptural record\u0014\n                      between baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking \nin tongues is\u0014\n                      apparent from at least two passages in Acts. \nFirst, recall Acts 1\u0014\n                      and 2. Jesus told his disciples that, though \nJohn baptized with\u0014\n                      water, they would be baptized with the Holy \nSpirit (1:5). Several\u0014\n                      days later in Jerusalem, Jesus' promise came to \npass: \"They\u0014\n                      were all filled with the Holy Spirit\" (2:4, \nNAS). \"Baptizing\" and\u0014\n                      \"filling\" seemed to refer to the same \nexperience. Immediately\u0014\n                      thereafter they \"began to speak with other \ntongues.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A second example is found in Acts 10 and 11. \nPeter had been\u0014\n                      preaching the gospel to Gentiles in Caesarea \nwhen suddenly\u0014\n                      \"the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were \nlistening to the message\"\u0014\n                      and \"they [Peter and those with him] were \nhearing them\u0014\n                      speaking with tongues and exalting God\" \n(10:44-46). Peter later\u0014\n                      identified this experience as being \"baptized \nwith the Holy Spirit\"\u0014\n                      (11:15-16).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We do well to note the significance in Acts of \nbaptism in the Holy\u0014\n                      Spirit. Immediately following the Pentecost \nevent, Peter\u0014\n                      declared, \"This is what was spoken of through \nthe prophet Joel:\u0014\n                      'And it shall be in the last days, God says, \nthat I will pour forth of\u0014\n                      My Spirit upon all mankind.'\" After the similar \nevent at\u0014\n                      Caesarea, the Scripture states, \"The gift of \nthe Holy Spirit had\u0014\n                      been poured out upon the Gentiles also.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Speaking in tongues seemed to proceed from the \nabundance of\u0014\n                      the gift of the Holy Spirit. Tongues were the \noutward and\u0014\n                      audible expression of this abundance. Moreover, \nthese\u0014\n                      tongues, whether spoken in Jerusalem or \nCaesarea, were in\u0014\n                      praise of God and primarily directed to God. As \nPaul was later\u0014\n                      to say, \"One who speaks in a tongue does not \nspeak to men,\u0014\n                      but to God\" (1 Cor. 14:2).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Countless numbers of believers today testify \nthat they too have\u0014\n                      been baptized in the Holy Spirit and spoken in \ntongues. They\u0014\n                      see themselves as standing in the line of \nJerusalem and\u0014\n                      Caesarea (and, later, EphesusActs 19:6). For \nthem, speaking\u0014\n                      in tongues is not so much \"proof\" as it is \nsupernatural evidence\u0014\n                      of the Holy Spirit's powerful presence and \nactivity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So, \"Are those who haven't spoken in tongues \nwithout the Holy\u0014\n                      Spirit?\" Only those who have the Holy Spirit \ncan truly speak in\u0014\n                      tongues. To be a Christian is to be indwelt by \nthe Holy Spirit\u0014\n                      (Rom. 8:11), whether one speaks in tongues or \nnot. Indeed,\u0014\n                      many believers in Christ, including those from \nPentecostal and\u0014\n                      charismatic traditions, have never spoken in \ntongues.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For many believers, speaking in tongues \ncontinues to be an\u0014\n                      evidence of the Holy Spirit's presence. There \nare, however,\u0014\n                      many other evidences of the Spirit's activity: \nthe other gifts of\u0014\n                      the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8-10) and, most \nimportant, the\u0014\n                      expression of the fruit of the Spiritlove, \njoy, peace, patience,\u0014\n                      kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, \nand self-control\u0014\n                      (Gal. 5:22-23). The church in our time needs a \nhealthy balance\u0014\n                      of all these evidences.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      J.

    "words": "Sects, \nCults and Denominations\u0014\n\n                                                                            \nBY Pam Durso \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States is one of the most religious nations in the world. \nChristianity, especially, played an important part in the founding \nand development of this country, and it has continued to dominate \nAmerica's religious landscape.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, however, that religious landscape is quite diverse. The major \nreligions of the world are all firmly established in our nation, and \nsome of the newer American religious movements have grown into \nsizeable groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we classify these religious movements? What terminology should \nwe use in describing them?\u0014\nLeo Pfeffer, a distinguished American jurist and leading authority on \nchurch-state separation, once observed: \"If you believe in it, it is \na religion or perhaps the religion; and if you do not care one way or \nanother about it, it is a sect; but if you fear and hate it, it is a \ncult.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, Pfeffer's humorous statement is too often true. \nAmericans have tended to label those religious movements that are \ndifferent from their own tradition as sects and cults.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttempts at terminology and definitions can be traced to 1912. That \nyear the German theologian Ernst Troeltsch set forth his definitions \nof churches, sects and mysticism in his book, The Social Teaching of \nthe Christian Church. Troeltsch defined church as a universal body \ninto which people are born. The church, he wrote, covers the whole \nlife of humanity in society, and the clergys role is to proclaim the \nWord and dispense sacraments.\u0014\n\u0014\nTroeltsch defined sects as groups that renounce the world, have a \nvoluntary membership and insist that members experience a new birth \nand practice personal holiness. Mysticism, according to Troeltsch, is \na form of individualism that emphasizes inward spiritual experience, \nadopts and adapts ideas from Christianity and other religions, and \ngives little attention to fellowship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese three categories reflected the movements and splinter groups \nthat were part of European Christianity. In Europe, the politically \nestablished religious bodies were considered churches, and splinter \ngroups and independent bodies were viewed as sects. Sect members were \nseen as dissenters from the church and were often condemned and \npersecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\nTroeltsch's categories, however, do not adequately describe what \nhappened in America. When America gained independence from England, \nno church had sufficient power to become the dominant national \nreligion. The lack of an official national church contributed to the \nacceptance of religious liberty and the separation of church and \nstate. Because there was not an official church, \"sects\" could not be \ndefined as splinters from it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica's unique religious setup necessitated new categories and \u0014\ndefinitions. The new categories used in America have included \ndenomination, sect and cult. Unfortunately, there is not a generally \naccepted definition for any of these words, but following are some \ncommon definitions.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenominations are established religious bodies that have usually \nexisted for many years and have a geographically widespread \nmembership. Typically, congregations within a denomination hold the \nsame beliefs or creed, engage in similar practices, and cooperate \nwith each other to develop and maintain shared enterprises.\u0014\n\u0014\nSects are small offshoots of an established religion or denomination. \nThey hold most of the beliefs of the established religion, except for \na few novel concepts. Groups that oppose or separate themselves from \nthe dominant religious structures have also been labeled as sects.\u0014\n\u0014\nCults are religious innovations often imported from other cultural \nsettings. They are formed by a merger or adaptation of elements from \nmore than one religious tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe definitions of sect and cult often overlap, making it difficult \nto distinguish completely between these two terms. The labels of sect \nand cult are often given to new religious movements. Some groups that \nreceive these labels fade quickly from the scene. Others linger.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill others grow into an established religious movement and \neventually move into the denomination category. Well-established \ndenominations, including Baptists and Quakers, have in the past been \nlabeled as sects or cults.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, most Americans continue to react negatively to the terms sect \nand cult. Promoters of religious tolerance now favor terms like new \nreligious movement, alternative religious movement or emergent faith \ngroup.\u0014\n\u0014\nPam Durso serves as assistant professor of church history and Baptist \nheritage at Campbell University Divinity School in Buies Creek, N.C.\u0014",

    "words": "SBC's Numbers Decline after Push for Doctrinal Integrity\u0014\n\u0014\nBY Robert Parham \u0014\n\u0014\nThe total number of baptisms and Sunday school enrollment fell in \n2001, following a 2000 doctrinal statement by the \nfundamentalist-controlled Southern Baptist Convention. The statement \nwas an effort to purify the denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did the number of mission churches decline, but the overall \nrate of membership growth also slowed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 2001 baptisms declined 4.52 percent from the 2000 figures, \nreported Baptist Press. \"The decline ends four years of baptisms \ntotals above 400,000,\" BP wrote. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sunday School enrollment declined 3,671 or 0.04 percent of a total \nof 8,182,744, following an increase of 0.48 percent in 2000,\" BP \nreported.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of \"church-type missions\" declined 5.91 percent, while \n2001 membership increased at a lower percentage than in 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article's headline and lead paragraph trumpeted the \ndenomination's most positive numerical success in 2001: The SBC set a \nrecord in membership, topping 16 million. \u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptists have an abiding interest in church-related numbers. \nWe record and study numbers related to Sunday school attendance, \nWednesday night church suppers, church membership, baptisms and \nvisitors. We look at weekly offerings and mission giving. We judge \nour numerical health against last year's numbers. For generations, \nSouthern Baptists have said that numerical growth reflects God's \nblessing. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in the 1970s, Baptist fundamentalists warned of approaching \nstorm clouds. The SBC would experience a numerical slide, like \nMethodists and Presbyterians, unless the SBC purified itself \ntheologically.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenominational decay resulted from bad theology, fundamentalists \ncried. To prevent decay, Baptists needed to endorse the inerrancy of \nScripture, oppose women in ministry, back pastoral authority, \npractice expository preaching and make seminaries even more \nconservative.\u0014\nA common argument was that conservative theology produced growing \nchurches. The lack of doctrinal integrity resulted in decline.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn example of this numeric theology appeared in the specially called \nMay meeting of the Baptist General Association of Virginia. BP \nreported that Jeff Riddle, pastor of Jefferson Park Baptist Church, \nvoiced opposition to the new direction proposed for Virginia \nBaptists. Riddle rhetorically asked, \"Do you think that the numerical \ndecline of BGAV churches ... might be related to a doctrinal crisis \nin our churches?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf doctrinal integrity results in numerical growth, then why did SBC \nnumbers of baptisms decline? Why did Sunday school enrollment fall? \nWhy has the rate of membership growth slowed?\u0014\nJames Merritt, president of the SBC, told BP this week, \"Doctrinally, \nwe've never been stronger.\" Then he said, \"To be extremely candid, I \nam greatly afraid this denomination is getting away from evangelism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could this be? Could it be that the doctrinal integrity claim is \nnot the silver bullet for evangelism or numeric growth? \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is BCE's executive director.\u0014",

    "title": "SEVERE SUCCESS",
    "words": "Severe Success\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux was a tough act to followyet thousands of \nChristians walked his path.\u0014\nBy Elesha Coffman | posted 06/21/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nThe default impulse for struggling religious institutions is to reach \nout and ease up. Broaden the criteria for ordination. Reinterpret or \nabolish old rules. Make worship more inviting. Give everyone a say. \nForge partnerships. Work with the culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux took exactly the opposite approach when he \nfounded his first monastery on June 25, 1115. Yet by his death in \n1153, his monastery had spawned almost 170 daughter, granddaughter, \nand great-granddaughter abbeys across Europe. The story defies \ntypical logic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard was born into a family of minor French nobles in 1090. Around \nage 22 he entered the abbey at Citeaux, home of the Cistercian order. \nThe abbey had been founded in 1098 by Robert of Molesme and other \nmonks who thought the prominent Benedictine order had drifted from \nits mooringBenedict of Nursia's ascetic Rule for monastic life. \nBernard agreed with the reformers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, Bernard attacked the center of Benedictine life, the Cluny \nmonastery, writing of the Cluniac diet:\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile course after course is brought in. Only meat is lacking and \nto compensate for this two huge servings of fish are given. You might \nhave thought that the first was sufficient, but even the recollection \nof it vanishes once you have set to on the second. The cooks prepare \neverything with such skill and cunning that the four or five dishes \nalready consumed are no hindrance to what is to follow and the \nappetite is not checked by satiety. . . . The selection of dishes is \nso exciting that the stomach does not realize that it is being \nover-taxed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard's stomach would have noticed. He hardly ate anything. And \nwhen he was sent from Citeaux to found a like-minded monastery at \nClairvaux, he didn't let the monks under his authority each much, \neither. In Christian History issue 24, author Tony Lane described the \nsituation:\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Clairvaux Bernard carried his reforming ideas to extremes, and in \nhis early years this had unfortunate consequences. His high standards \nproved to be too severe for the frail humanity of his monks. After a \ntime they were unable to cope and Bernard had to slacken the reins. \nFurthermore, Bernard was stricter with himself than with others, with \nthe result that his health was permanently damaged. In particular, he \nsuffered from severe gastric problems and had ongoing problems with \ndigestion.

    "words": "Sheepish\u0014\nFeeling autonomous and proud? Then ponder the lives of sheep.\u0014\nBy Philip Yancey | posted 07/02/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nMy wife and I stayed once in a bed-and-breakfast in rural Tasmania, \nthe rugged island off the southern coast of Australia. A sheep \nrancher had built a guest cottage in the middle of his fields, and \nfor an extra fee, lodgers could take a meal in the ranch house. \nKnowing we would probably never eat fresher lamb, we signed on.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver dinner I asked innocently about the odd coloringorange, red, \nblue, and green swatcheswe had seen on the rumps of his sheep. \"Ah, \nthat's how we tell when the ewes mated,\" he explained with a laugh. \n\"I hang a container of colored chalk in a rather strategic place on \nmy rams. He leaves his mark when he does his duty, and that way I \nknow that all the ewes with orange rumps were serviced on the 21st. \nWhen the due date rolls aroundsheep deliver right on time and \nthey're 100 percent fertileI can herd the orange ewes into the barn \nand give them special care.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the next few minutes I learned much more about the reproductive \nhabits of sheep. Each ewe has only a six-hour window of receptivity \nto mating. This poses no problem to the ram, who has an infallible \nsense of which ewe might welcome him at any given moment. The rancher \nrelied on 10 rams to service 4,000 female sheep, which meant that the \nrams worked themselves to exhaustion over several weeks, losing much \nof their body weight in the process. All work, no romance.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I saw a scrawny, bedraggled ramhis chores done, his strength \ndissipated, good for nothing but the slaughterhouse, and even then \nunfit for human consumptionI breathed a prayer of thanks to God for \nadjusting the terms of sexuality in the human species. (Zoologists \nnote that very few speciesdolphins, some primates, and the large \ncatsengage in sex as a form of pleasure.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning I went jogging through the fields, taking care where \nI stepped. I tried to imagine life from the sheep's point of view. \nNinety percent of waking hours they spend wandering around, heads \ndown, looking for lush green grass. Occasionally a dog barks and nips \nat their heels, and to humor him and shut him up they move in the \ndirection he wants them to. Lo, better grass often awaits them there. \nAs weather changes, they learn to huddle together in rain and wind.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce a year, a rambunctious cousin appears among them and dashes from \nsheep to sheep, leaving the ewes marked with strange colors on their \nrumps. Bellies swell, lambs emerge, and attention turns to weaning \nthese small, frisky creatures and watching them gambol through the \ngrass. Brothers and sisters may disappear, sometimes attacked by a \nTasmanian devil (these nasty animals, carnivorous marsupials, really \ndo exist!) and sometimes ushered away by the two-legged one. The same \ncreature periodically drives them into a barn where he shaves off \ntheir coats, leaving them cold and embarrassed (sheepish) for a time.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I jogged, it occurred to me that sheep, to the degree they think \nat all, may well presume they order their own destiny. They chew cud, \nroam the fields, make choices, and live out their lives with only a \nfew rude interruptions from dogs, devils, rams, and humans. Little do \nthey know that the entire scenario, from birth to death and every \nstage in between, is being orchestrated according to a rational plan \nby the humans who live in the ranch house.\u0014\n\u0014\nC. S. Lewis conjectured, \"There may be Natures piled upon Natures, \neach supernatural to the one beneath it.\" The sheep analogy is \ninexact, of course: Not even the dumbest sheep would deny the \nexistence of another world out theremarsupials, humans, dogsthat \nimpinges on its own. We humans, especially those who live in \nreductionistic modern times, have simply decided that nothing exists \nbeyond the range of our sense organs. Some are convinced that what we \ncannot see must not exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo we stand in relation to God as sheep stand in relation to us? In \nsome ways, no: God grants the ability for knowledge \"from below,\" and \nallows intimate exchange with himself. In some ways, yes: \"Know that \nthe Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his \npeople, the sheep of his pasture,\" wrote the psalmist. Note the \npossessives: his people, his pasture. We live our days in a world \nthat, in its essence, its origin, and its destiny, belongs to God, \nwith ourselves as God's own possessions. We may insist on our own \nautonomy\"All we like sheep have gone astray\"but in the end it is no \nmore impressive, or effective, than the autonomy of a Tasmanian ewe.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014\nJuly 8, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 8, Page 72\u0014",

    "words": "Singlewith Children\u0014\nThree keys to effective ministry with single-parent families.\u0014\nby Barbara Schiller\u0014\n\u0014\nJennifer knocks nervously on the pastor's door. She wonders if she \ncan find the courage to explain her story of a painful marriage, \nphysical abuse, and divorce. When she enters the office, the pastor \nsees the pain in her eyes. \"Jennifer, I think I know why you are \nhere. You and Dave are divorcing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter an hour of talking, Jennifer feels neither comfort nor support \nfrom her pastor. But they do pray together. As she leaves his office, \nJennifer wipes back tears and looks for her car. She has no idea how \nshe is going to support her three children. She has been a \nstay-at-home mom for eight years. She feels alone, confused, and \nafraid of the future. Praying with the pastor was good, but Jennifer \nis losing hope. Her pantry is nearly empty, and she doesn't have the \ncourage to tell anyone how desperate she is.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jennifer arrives home, her kids ask, \"Mommy, what's for dinner? \nWe're hungry!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are countless Jennifers in our churches today: single parents \nwho have to accomplish nearly everything alone, like working \nfull-time, keeping house, maintaining the car, paying the bills, and \nferrying the kids to school, church, Little League, and piano lessons.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many churches are helping single parents with practical and \nfinancial needs, the churches that most effectively assist single \nparents also listen to the needs of the heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nMake them visible and valued\u0014\n\u0014\nAlan and Linda Kibble of Faith Community Church in The Woodlands, \nTexas, first became aware of these needs when their daughters \nbefriended children from single-parent homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nRealizing these single moms needed encouragement, they presented the \nneed for single-parent ministry to their church's governing board and \noffered to help meet it. The result is a ministry called the Oasis.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal of the Oasis is to encourage single parents by making them a \nvisible and valued segment of the congregation. The Oasis team does \nthis in four ways:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bless a Single-Parent\" connects families with goods and services. An \ninsert in the bulletin lists material needs, projects, and ministries \nthe congregation can provide. Church leaders personally participate \nin meeting these needs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nActivities and classes. At Faith Community many educational and \nsocial opportunities are offered, and childcare is provided at all \nweeknight meetings so single parents can participate in the programs \nand ministry teams.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA Web site especially for single parents: www.faithcc.org/oasis. The \nsite lists all the church ministries, solicits donations such as \nfurniture and appliances from the congregation, and provides links to \nother single-parent ministries in the community.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSingle Parent Sunday. Worship services are dedicated to and hosted by \nsingle parents, giving them opportunity to be recognized for their \nrole in church life. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Alan and Linda, this is the most effective event Oasis \nsponsors. The message is \"We welcome and value you.\" For moms or dads \nraising their kids alone, who feel apart from to the two-parent \nculture, they need to hear that often.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A woman in her thirties came to the Oasis Sunday school class,\" Alan \nsays. \"She was unmarried, pregnant, withdrawn, and alone. She had \nexperienced more than her share of rejection.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She was in a town where she knew no one, and the father of her baby \nwas gone. She had little church background. We welcomed her to the \ngroup and tried to make her feel comfortable.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One Sunday after class, with teary eyes, she told us she felt no one \ncared about her. She said she wanted someone who would always be \nthere for her no matter what happened.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Faith Community Church, she found a church that welcomed and \nencouraged her. She also found someone who would always be there for \nher; she received Christ that morning.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Today,\" Alan says, \"she continues to blossom into a capable, loving \nChristian mother of a beautiful three-year-old daughter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOffer connections\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLaura Dodson, a single mother and former coordinator of family life \nat Church of Our Savior in Cocoa Beach, Florida, wanted to know what \ncaused her church's families to struggle. She and the pastoral staff \ndeveloped a survey and placed copies in the pews at every service. \nEighteen responses were from single parents, and they all requested a \nsupport group.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaura then planned an ongoing support group, not only for the single \nparents, but also their children. The evenings began with a fast food \nmeal for everyone. After dinner the children, working in two age \ngroups, were given opportunities to explore and express their \nemotions through puppet shows, craft projects, and other activities. \nThe parents went next door to a video-hosted discussion on issues \nlike alienation, finances, and the grief slope. Before rejoining \ntheir children, parents were given a key question to provoke \ndiscussion of the night's activities at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nFellowship for single parents doesn't always have to take the form of \na traditional support group. Crossroads Church in Corona, California, \ndoes not offer a separate single-parent ministry. Yet the church has \nbeen successful in ministering to single parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarl and Noryne Mascarella, both on staff at Crossroads, realized \nthat the church's singles shared much in common with its single \nparents. In fact, the single parents insisted they didn't want to be \nseparated from the other singles. Instead of dividing the two groups, \nCrossroads Church created an All Singles' Night for the whole \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo facilitate the mixing of singles and single parents, Crossroads \nChurch offers free childcare during the weekly Friday night \ngathering. The evening includes a meal for everyone, including the \nchildren, a lesson and discussion time at round tables, and an \nactivity. The activity might be a movie, a concert, board games, or \neven dance lessons. Carl says, \"Think of it as a date night, with you \nand a hundred of your closest friends.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProvide ears and opportunities\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPamela McKnight lost her husband to a lengthy illness while a member \nof Richland Hills Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas. Her plight \nawakened the church to the growing number of single parents in the \ncongregation, so they decided to hire someone to work with single \nparents and their children. During their search, the leaders \nrecognized something else. Pamela had a tender heart and a vision for \nsingle-parent families. So they hired Pamela!\u0014\n\u0014\nThey learned that enabling and empowering single parents can address \nmany needs at the same time. Pamela seeks to do for other single \nparents what the church did for her. She networks single parents with \nreputable community resources, including financial and mental health \ncounselors, to help them build a secure foundation for family living. \nAs an example, Pamela reports this story:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Cathy, who is in her forties with two kids, had been away from the \nchurch for several years. She owned her trailer, but then lost it, \nwas driving a borrowed car, was out of work and unable to return to \nher trade because of a neck injury.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When Cathy heard about our ministry through a mailing, she met with \nme one-to-one. A year later she is working successfully at a \nChristian business, is living in a house as part of our church's \nhomeless ministry, has a car that was donated by a member of the \nchurch, and has completed counseling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPamela says the individual attention she offers may be the most \nimportant factor in single-parent ministry. She often takes people to \nlunch and simply listens to their journeys, to assure them that in \nthis church, the single parent is more than a faceless statistic.\u0014\nThese churches succeed not because of programs and budgets, but \nbecause they listen to practical needs and prayer requests. And they \nlisten to what single parents desire most: to be valued, to be part \nof a supportive community, and to be empowered to build a new and \nhealthy family life.\u0014\nBarbara Schiller is a single mother and founder of Single Parent \nFamily Resources. \u0014\nwww.singleparentfamilyresources.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nSingle Parent Sunday\u0014\n\u0014\nA worship service that raises awareness of one-parent households.\u0014\nFaith Community Church in The Woodlands, Texas, annually honors \nparents going it alone. Here are some ways single parents are \nspecially included in worship and their needs brought before the \ncongregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe greeters: Single parents serve as the morning's greeters and \nushers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bulletin: A list of specific needs are included in the worship \nfolder along with a response form for offering time and talent to \nsupport those families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message: The sermon often addresses single-parent family issues. \nJeremiah 29:5-7, for example, describes the dreams of every couple, \neven those now broken in one-parent homes. Verses 11-14 offer hope \nand promises of blessing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe acknowledgment: Single parents are invited to stand and be \nacknowledged.

    "title": "SINGULAR HOPE",
    "words": "Singular Hope\u0014\nDon't tell the unmarried to \"be content.\" Here's a better response.\u0014\nby Kimberly Hartke \u0014\n\u0014\nIn my early 20's, I couldn't relate to my over-40 friend who was \nbeside herself because she didn't have a husband. I, like so many \nothers, thought she would be better off if she could just be content \nwith singleness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut 20 years later, I know differently. Singleness hurts. And I \nlearned how to minister to those who bear its pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nI married for the first time at the age of 40. Getting married later \nin life was a spiritual battle of epic proportions. As an older \nsingle, I warred against doubt, discouragement, rejection, and \ndepression. I navigated the minefield of today's male-female \nrelationships. Bitterness, resentment, and even antipathy toward the \nopposite sex had foiled my attempts to find true love.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of this invisible war, several well-meaning Christians \noffered some unhelpful advice. \"You just need to be content,\" they \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just be content\" encouraged me as an optimistic 20-year-old. But it \nbecame hurtful when I began fearing my 30s, 40s, or even 50s without \nany prospects for marriage. It was easy to be content when I had \nhope. But when that hope was weak, I needed it replenished.\u0014\n\u0014\nOlder singles grieve the loss of their youth, lost years of love, and \nthe children that they have not borne. The pain of extended \nsingleness isn't so much coveting a relationship, but grieving lost \ndreams. If it is insensitive to tell a recent widow to be content in \nthe midst of her loss, it is equally insensitive to say it to someone \nwho is widowed by circumstance.\u0014\n\u0014\nA grieving single needs encouragement to persevere through this trial \nand to continue believing and trusting in God. \"Just be content\" \ntells hurting singles not to hope, not to desire, not to dream, not \nto have faith, but to abandon the cry of their hearts. Surrendering \nhope is the wrong answer to the question: \"Why am I not married?\" An \nextended period of singleness presented my faith in God with its \nbiggest challenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nSole searching\u0014\n\u0014\nThe work God does in singles' lives to prepare them for marriage \noften involves suffering. God may use the pain of singleness to \nbetter prepare them to be a loving spouse or to inspire them to seek \nhealing. The heavy hand of God may help a single to repent of sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen their loneliness lasts too long, many singles begin to suppress \ntheir God-given desire to marry. They bury themselves in their job or \nchurch work to stave off loneliness and to prove how productive they \ncan be without a partner. Busy schedules crowd out opportunities to \nsocialize and to find love.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome singles worry about obsessing over marriage, so they neglect to \nprepare themselves for the possibility. They wrongly assume that if \nit is going to happen, it will just happen.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut denial and distraction don't diminish the pain. When singles \nconfess their frustrations, they have most likely neared the end of \ntheir faith. Typically, they have been silently struggling with this \nissue for years, maybe decades. They have stretched what faith they \nhave as far as it can go. Now they need something more. They need \nhelp.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat helps the lonely?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Paul explained to the Philippians, \"I have learned to be content \nin whatever circumstances I am\" (Phil. 4:11), he followed that with, \n\"I can do all things through Him who strengthens me\" (v. 13). The \ncontentment follows confidence in Christ. But many long-term singles \nhave lost that confidence, doubting that they may ever marry. \"I can \ndo all things, except find someone to love me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul goes on to say, \"Nevertheless, you have done well to share with \nme in my affliction\" (Phil. 4:14). Churches that follow the \nPhilippian church's example when ministering to singles can restore \ntheir hope. Most singles would be delighted for other Christians to \ncome alongside with counsel and care.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways singles need the same things that other \"broken\" people \nneed: prayer, support, encouragement, and affirmation. Specifically, \nsingles need assurance that they can learn to be content within \ntoday's trials and that they can believe Christ will give them the \nstrength to do all things, including marry.\u0014\n\u0014\nTangible help can be valuable too. If someone in the church desired \nan education or a certain job, practical help might include \nintroducing the job-seeker to someone who can advance their cause.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same way, churches can support a single person's dream to \nmarry by including him or her in social opportunities and by \nintroducing new people to each other. Many good marriages have been \nmade by a supportive friend offering to play a little matchmaker.\u0014\n\u0014\nSearching for true love requires risk, persistence, stamina, and \nguts. It expends tremendous emotional energy. For those who have done \nthis year after year to no avail, it is easy to give up, to curl up \nat home with a pet rather than risk disappointment or rejection again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's when the lonely warrior needs an allysomeone to remind him \nthat God delights in fulfilling our heart's desires and that he \nrewards those who diligently seek him, someone to assure her that her \ndesire for marriage is godly.\u0014\n\u0014\nI used to think long-term singles needed to learn contentedness. But \nthen I became one. Now, I have a better answer for men and women who \nwant to be married.\u0014\n\u0014\nI acknowledge their need for a spouse and offer to pray that the \ndesires of their hearts will be met.\u0014\n\u0014\nKimberly Hartke is the founder of True Love Ministries in Reston, \nVirginia. truelove@northernva.com\u0014",

    "title": "STEPS TO WEALTH -- ACCORDING TO GEORGE W. BUSH",
    "words": "July 16, 2002 The New York Times\u0014\nSteps to Wealth\u0014\nBy PAUL KRUGMAN\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy are George W. Bush's business dealings relevant? Given that his \naides tout his \"character,\" the public deserves to know that he \nbecame wealthy entirely through patronage and connections. But more \nimportant, those dealings foreshadow many characteristics of his \nadministration, such as its obsession with secrecy and its \nintermingling of public policy with private interest. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the unanswered questions about Harken Energy pile up  what's in \nthose documents the White House won't release? Who was the mystery \nbuyer of Mr. Bush's stock?  let me now turn to how Mr. Bush, who got \nby with a lot of help from his friends in the 1980's, became wealthy \nin the 1990's. He invested $606,000 as part of a syndicate that \nbought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989  borrowing the money \nand repaying the loan with the proceeds from his Harken stock sale  \nthen saw that grow to $14.9 million over the next nine years. What \nmade his investment so successful?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the city of Arlington built the Rangers a new stadium, on \nterms extraordinarily favorable to Mr. Bush's syndicate, eventually \nsubsidizing Mr. Bush and his partners with more than $150 million in \ntaxpayer money. The city was obliged to raise taxes substantially as \na result. Soon after the stadium was completed, Mr. Bush ran \nsuccessfully for governor of Texas on the theme of self-reliance \nrather than reliance on government. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bush's syndicate eventually resold the Rangers, for triple the \noriginal price. The price-is-no-object buyer was a deal maker named \nTom Hicks. And thereby hangs a tale. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe University of Texas, though a state institution, has a large \nendowment. As governor, Mr. Bush changed the rules governing that \nendowment, eliminating the requirements to disclose \"all details \nconcerning the investments made and income realized,\" and to have \"a \nwell-recognized performance measurement service\" assess investment \nresults. That is, government officials no longer had to tell the \npublic what they were doing with public money, or allow an \nindependent performance assessment. Then Mr. Bush \"privatized\" (his \nterm) $9 billion in university assets, transferring them to a \nnonprofit corporation known as Utimco that could make investment \ndecisions behind closed doors.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn effect, the money was put under the control of Utimco's chairman: \nTom Hicks. Under his direction, at least $450 million was invested in \nprivate funds managed by Mr. Hicks's business associates and major \nRepublican Party donors. The managers of such funds earn big fees. \nDue to Mr. Bush's change in the rules, these investments were hidden \nfrom public view; an employee of Utimco who alerted university \nauditors was summarily fired. Even now, it's hard to find out how \nthese investments turned out, though they seem to have done quite \nbadly. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually Mr. Hicks's investment style created a public furor, and \nhe did not seek to retain his position at Utimco when his term \nexpired in 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne last item: Mr. Bush, who put up 1.8 percent of the Rangers \nsyndicate's original capital, was entitled to about $2.3 million from \nthat sale. But his partners voluntarily gave up some of their share, \nand Mr. Bush received 12 percent of the proceeds  $14.9 million. So \na group of businessmen, presumably with some interest in government \ndecisions, gave a sitting governor a $12 million gift. Shouldn't that \nhave raised a few eyebrows? \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this showed Mr. Bush's characteristic style. First there's the \npenchant for secrecy, for denying the public information about \ndecisions taken in its name. So it's no surprise that the proposed \nHomeland Security Department will be exempt from the Freedom of \nInformation Act and from whistle-blower protection. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen there's the conversion of institutions traditionally insulated \nfrom politics into tools for rewarding your friends and reinforcing \nyour political control. Yesterday the University of Texas endowment; \ntoday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; tomorrow those Social \nSecurity \"personal accounts\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, there's the indifference to conflicts of interest. In \nAustin, Governor Bush saw nothing wrong with profiting personally \nfrom a deal with Tom Hicks; in Washington, he sees nothing wrong with \nhaving the Pentagon sign what look like sweetheart deals with Dick \nCheney's former employer Halliburton. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo the style of a future Bush administration was easily predictable, \ngiven Mr. Bush's career history. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company | Permissions | Privacy \nPolicy \u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014",

    "words": "Screening Children's Workers\u0014\nHow to protect your church kids from sexual abuse.\u0014\nJames F. Cobble, Jr.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Cobble Jr. is executive director of Christian Ministry \nResources and publisher of Church Law & Tax Report.\u0014\n\u0014\nNews reports have spotlighted the problem of child sexual abuse in \nthe Roman Catholic Church, but Protestant churches also have reason \nto be concerned. Our research indicates that on average, over the \npast ten years, approximately 3,500 churches per year have responded \nto allegations of sexual misconduct in church programs involving \nchildren or youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThousands of churches have taken steps to reduce this problem. Yet \nmuch more still needs to be done.\u0014\n\u0014\nScreening workers is essential to protecting children from sexual \npredators. Churches are making progress in screening paid employees, \nbut screening volunteer workers remains problematic.\u0014\nNearly 3 out of 4 churches use a written application for paid \nworkers, up from 47% in 1993. Yet, the vast majority of \nchurches-almost 70 percent-do little to screen volunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nA bill pending in Congress would create a central agency to process \ncriminal background checks and coordinate information from all 50 \nstates.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil that happens, however, the system is still entrusted to local \nagencies, and it can be slow and even costly. But screening workers \nis vital, for two reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, churches can be found liable for the negligent selection of a \nvolunteer, just as they can for a paid employee. Second, our research \nindicates that volunteer workers are just as likely to be the \nperpetrators of abuse as are paid staff members.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main goal of a church-screening program is to ward off \nindividuals who have an intent or history of abusing children. A \nchurch that establishes a screening program sends a message. \nPredators do not want to be in such a church.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow is the time to review your church's the screening process and \nchildcare supervision policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo kinds of molesters\u0014\n\u0014\nTime magazine estimates the prevalence of adults who are sexually \ninterested in children (pedophilia) at 4 percent of the population. \nThat does not include the percentage interested in teenagers \n(ephebophilia), which psychiatrists don't classify as an illness. The \npoint is that the number of adults interested in sexual activity with \nminors is higher than one would imagine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two general profiles of child molesters are important for church \nleaders to understand: preferential molesters and situational \nmolesters. (These are identified by Kenneth V. Lanning in Practical \nAspects of Rape Investigation, Elsevier, 1987.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPreferential molesters. These molesters have a preference for \nchildren, often of a particular age and gender. While these \nindividuals are few in number, a single perpetrator can molest \nhundreds of children. Preferential molesters pose a unique and \nserious danger to churches. Such an individual may appear as the \nideal worker for children. They enjoy being with children and will \nspend lots of time socializing with them. Since most churches find it \nhard to recruit adults to work with children, finding someone who \nenjoys being with children and who is willing to invest significant \ntime in church programs may be viewed as a blessing. Thus, the \nchurch's guard may be down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best way to ward off preferential molesters is to develop an \nenvironment that puts the molester at risk rather than the children. \nThat process begins with a thorough screening program for both paid \nand volunteer workers, and some healthy skepticism among the leaders \nresponsible for recruiting and training workers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSituational molesters. Far more situational molesters exist in our \nsociety than preferential molesters, but they have fewer victims. \nThis person engages in misconduct when a situation develops or exists \nthat makes the abuse possible. Screening may ward off some \nsituational molesters. More important are policies that provide \nsupervision of workers and ensure multiple workers in classrooms.\u0014\nFrom a legal perspective, a church must engage in the same duty of \ncare in the selection of volunteers who work with children and youth \nas it does in the selection of paid staff members. In both cases, the \nselection process should reflect the standard of reasonable care. \nHere are some suggestions:\u0014\n\u0014\nRaise the threshold\u0014\n\u0014\nStart by establishing requirements that must be met before an \nindividual can serve in a position working with children or youth. \nFor volunteers, attention should be given to two factors: (1) how \nlong the person has been part of the congregation, and (2) the level \nof involvement the person has in the church.\u0014\nThe six-month rule. Start by establishing a length of time the person \nmust first attend the church, such as six months, before he or she \ncan volunteer to work with children or youth. The purpose of this \nrule is to prevent molestor from gaining quick access to potential \nvictims. A predator will not want to stick around a church for an \nextended period of time waiting to get access to children, especially \nwhen he can go elsewhere and have almost immediate access.\u0014\n\u0014\nMembership or equivalent. This requirement focuses on the \nindividual's commitment to and involvement in the congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nVolunteers who work with children should be involved in the church, \nand able to list two other church members who can serve as informed \nreferences concerning that involvement. This is especially important \nin large congregations where staff members may not know every member \nwell, and yet depend on large numbers of recruited volunteers to \nassist with church programs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not enough for a person to have attended the congregation for \nsix months. He or she should also be active enough in the life of the \nchurch that other members can provide a reference.\u0014\n\u0014\nImplement formal screening\u0014\n\u0014\nThe screening process for volunteers is similar to that of paid \nemployees. It should include the use of a written application, \nreference checks, a personal interview, and in some cases, criminal \nrecords checks. Make sure that all information is maintained as \nconfidential. Forms for these applications and interviews should be \ndeveloped and approved by the congregation and reviewed by the \nchurch's attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\nUse a written application form. While using a written application \nform may sound obvious, our data indicates many churches still do not \nuse one. Sample applications may be available from other \norganizations such as the local school district or the YMCA. \nChristian Ministry Resources has developed separate application \nbooklets for clergy, paid church employees, and volunteer workers \n(which are available for $3 each at 800-222-1840). Make sure the \napplication you use contains a release form. In many states, a signed \nrelease form authorizes you to collect information from references, \nand enables the references to share legitimate concerns about a \nformer worker without fear of legal liability.\u0014\n\u0014\nConduct reference checks. Once the written application is complete, \nthe church should conduct reference checks. Normally, for prospective \njob applicants, the references should include former employers as \nwell as personal and professional references. As noted above, \nvolunteers should list at least two church members. These people \nshould be contacted for input concerning the volunteer's \nqualifications for working with children or youth. Often this is done \neither in person or over the phone.\u0014\n\u0014\nDocument in writing all efforts in collecting the reference, and the \ninformation you receive. Once you are finished, keep all forms and \nnotes with the application.\u0014\n\u0014\nConduct a personal interview. Once reference checks are complete, \nconduct a personal interview. Use the interview as a time to explore \nmore fully why the volunteer wants to work with children or youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can also use this time to provide training to the volunteer as \nwell. It's a good time to cover church policies and procedures \nregarding the supervision of children.\u0014\n\u0014\nConduct a criminal records check. Once a provisional offer of \nemployment for a paid position is made, many churches then conduct \nadditional background checks, including a criminal records check.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome churches conduct criminal records checks on all volunteers, as \nwell. Minimally, the church should request a criminal records check \nfor volunteers who have frequent and unsupervised access to children \nor youth. The phrase \"unsupervised access to children\" appears in \nboth state and federal legislation to identify individuals requiring \na higher level of screening and accountability. Unfortunately, the \nphrase is vague and its exact application to specific situations \nwithin a church is not always clear. The committee report that \naccompanied the federal National Child Protection Act contains the \nfollowing comment that provides some clarification:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[Not] all occupations and volunteer positionsmerit the time and \nexpense of criminal history records checks. There are other means \navailable to protect children from abuse, including the checking of \nprior employment history and character references and proper training \nand supervision of employees and volunteers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCurrently, only about 3 congregations in 10 do anything to screen \nvolunteer workers. Of those that do, 6 in 10 also conduct criminal \nbackground checks. Such checks are becoming more common and less \nexpensive. Churches interested in criminal records checks or other \nbackground checks can obtain more information at our Web site: \nwww.screenchurchstaff.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsk the tough questions\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kinds of criminal convictions disqualify an individual from \nworking with youth or children in the church? A criminal conviction \nfor a sexual offense involving a minor would certainly disqualify an \napplicant. In the case of pedophilic behavior, such a conviction \nshould disqualify an individual no matter how long ago it occurred \n(because of the virtual impossibility that such a condition can be \n\"cured\").\u0014\nOther automatic disqualifiers would include incest, rape, assaults \ninvolving minors, murder, kidnapping, child pornography, sodomy, and \nthe physical abuse of a minor. Other crimes strongly indicate that a \nperson should not be considered for work with minors in a church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome crimes would not be automatic disqualifiers, because they would \nnot necessarily suggest a risk of child abuse or molestation. Some \nproperty offenses would be included in this list, particularly if the \noffense occurred a long time ago and the individual has a long \nhistory of impeccable behavior.\u0014\nChurches should interview all applicants for children's or youth work \nprior to using them in any such program or activity. When conducting \nan interview, use a standardized and written list of questions.The \ninterview also provides opportunity to offer review with applicants \nchurch policies and procedures.\u0014\nIt is also important for the church to identify a person who will \nconduct these interviews and for this person to be trained in \ninterviewing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the interview, there should be written notations on the \ninterview form identifying the person who conducted the interview, \nthe applicant who was interviewed, the date of the interview, and a \nsummary of the applicant's responses to the questions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll information, whether collected on a form or during an interview, \nshould be kept strictly confidential.\u0014\n\u0014\nLegal and moral obligations\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a minimum, when screening either paid employees or volunteer \nworkers, a church should: (1) use a written application, (2) do \nreference checks, (3) interview the volunteer, and (4) provide \ntraining. To our knowledge, no church that has done these four things \nhas been found liable of negligent selection.\u0014\nThe recent attention given to the problem of child sexual abuse in \nthe church establishes an important point. American society and \nchurch members themselves will not excuse churches that do not \nprotect their children. The safety of children outweighs any other \nconsideration, and no jury will tolerate any excuse, especially one \nthat merely protests that screening is inconvenient.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more information about screening, supervision, responding to \nallegations of misconduct, and training church members, visit \nwww.ChurchSafety.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames F.

    "title": "SPURGEON ON JABEZ",
    "words": "Spurgeon on Jabez\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat history's most prolific preacher said, in 1871, about the Prayer \nof Jabez.\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong | posted 08/23/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we have recently been reminded by Bruce Wilkinson's best-selling \nbook on the subject, Jabeza man mentioned only once in the \nBibleprayed for God to \"enlarge his territory,\" and God granted his \nrequest.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilkinson, founder and president of Walk Thru the Bible Ministries, \ninterprets \"territory\" as \"opportunity for evangelistic ministry.\" \nArguably, no person in the history of the church has had a larger \n\"territory\" than the 19th-century British preacher Charles Haddon \nSpurgeon.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong before the first megachurch, Spurgeon preached regularly (often \n10 times in a week) to audiences of 6,000 and more. He once addressed \nan audience of 23,654, without aid of amplification. He grew the \ncongregation of his New Park Street Church from 232 in 1854 to 5,311 \nin 1892, making it the largest independent congregation in the world. \nPrime Ministers, presidents, and other notables flocked to hear him. \nNo preacher in the history of the church has been more prolific: His \ncollected sermons amount to more than 20 million wordsa number \nequivalent to the 27 volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th edition. \nSeveral of his books and collections have sold over 1 million copies, \nand his sermons are still read as models today.\u0014\n\u0014\nWouldn't it be interesting if Spurgeon told us what he thought of the \n\"prayer of Jabez\"? Well, indeed he did. In the year 1871, standing \nbefore his congregation at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, \nSpurgeon took as his text 1 Chronicles 4:10: \"Now Jabez called on the \nGod of Israel, saying, 'Oh that You would bless me indeed and enlarge \nmy border, and that Your hand might be with me, and that You would \nkeep me from harm that it may not pain me!' And God granted him what \nhe requested.\" (NASB)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe contrasts between Spurgeon's sermon and Bruce Wilkinson's recent \nblockbuster \"book-ette\" are instructive.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe'll start with Wilkinson's book. If you haven't read it already, \nsomebody you know has. The language on the back cover helps to \nexplain its multi-million copy sales success: Breathlessly, the blurb \ncopy seeks to draw us in: \"Are you ready . to ask God for the \nabundant blessings He longs to give you?\" Just praying Jabez's simple \nprayer will, the blurb promises, \"release God's favor, power, and \nprotection\" and allow the enterprising Christian to \"break through to \nthe life you were meant to live.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis sort of appeal may sell books, but it courts spiritual \npresumptuousness.\u0014\n\u0014\nInside, however, there are things to admire. Wilkinson argues that \nmost Christians have simply not expected enough from the Creator of \nthe Universe. He encourages his readers to \"have faith in an \nextraordinary, miraculous God\" and \"step out to act on that faith.\" \nHe stresses that this confidence must be rooted in total dependence \non God, rather than in any strength of our own. He downplays native \nability and talent, insisting that God uses \"ordinary people.\" And he \ninsists we must pray for God's agenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere the trouble occurs, and where Spurgeon's 130-year-old take on \nJabez is instructive, is in Wilkinson's one-sided portrayal of what \n\"God's agenda\"or in Jabez's words, the \"blessing indeed\"might look \nlike. On this score, we never get very far from the \nsales-motivational hype of the back cover. Throughout the book, \nWilkinson continues to talk about the Christian life in terms of \n\"unclaimed blessings,\" like money in a forgotten account just waiting \nto be collected by the person bold enough to step up and ask for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nGranted, this is not the prosperity gospel of recent decades. \nWilkinson ties \"blessing indeed\" to greater effectiveness in \nministry. The deal is, you pray for God to \"enlarge your life\" so \nthat you can, in turn, \"make a greater impact for Him.\" Then, \"as \nyour [ministry] opportunities expand, your ability and resources \nsupernaturally increase, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd granted, Wilkinson encourages his readers to \"let God work in \nyour life regardless of what He chooses,\" as \"it will always be for \nyour best.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is no hint in this book that that \"best\" might sometimes \nseem less than a blessing to our human eyes. We are to expect clear \nsailing, as long as we don't sin and depart from \"God's agenda.\" This \nis a feel-good message. Wilkinson assures his readers, \"if you're \nlike many who use the Jabez prayeryou'll come to times in your life \nwhen you feel so blessed that you stop praying for more, at least for \na while.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about those times when our prayers seem to hit a brass sky, or \nwe struggle with pain, disappointment, or grief? We get no hint in \nthis book that such times exist for people who \"use\" this bold prayer \nof Jabez. Spurgeon, though, had every reason to know that they did. \nFor he was a man who experienced not only great \"enlargement of \nterritory,\" but great suffering as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout Spurgeon's life, he experienced bouts of depression. He \nalso endured gout, kidney inflammation, and other illnesses that laid \nhim out, incapacitated and in excruciating pain, for weeks and even \nmonths at a time. Thus when he came to meditate on the fact that \nJabez was named for the exceptional pain his birth had caused his \nmother (1 Chron. 4:9), he counseled, \"To a great extent we find that \nwe must sow in tears before we can reap in joy.You may expect a \nblessing in serving God if you are enabled to persevere under many \ndiscouragements.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWilkinson's brand of evangelical activism requires a pragmatic, \nbusiness-like approach to the Christian life. It regards \ninterruptionany suffering or delayas intolerable. Indeed, Wilkinson \nwrites: \"Do you believe that a supernatural God is going to show up \nto keep you from evil .? Jabez did believe, and he acted on his \nbelief. Thereafter his life was spared from the grief and pain that \nevil brings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurgeon's approach to the Christian life, on the other hand, leaves \nroom for pain and delay. Focusing as he did on the formation of \nChristian character and on intimacy with God in Christ, Spurgeon \ncould tolerate and even welcome suffering. As he thought about what \nJabez might have meant by \"blessing indeed,\" he reminisced on his own \nlife: \"I have oftentimes looked gratefully back to my sick chamber. I \nam certain that I never did grow in grace one half so much anywhere \nas I have upon the bed of pain.\" In light of his own experience of \ngrowth through suffering, Spurgeon could affirm that pain may bring \nthe greatest possible blessingeternal fellowship with a loving \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean, Spurgeon added, that we should all pray for pain. \nNot everyone needs this kind of discipline. Indeed it \"ought not to \nbe so\" that any of us need it. \"Our joyous mercies ought to be great \nfertilizers to our spirit.\" But given the lingering effects of sin in \nus, \"not unfrequently our griefs are more salutary than our joys. The \npruning knife is best for some of us,\" and in the end \"this light \naffliction may work out for you a far more exceeding and eternal \nweight of glory,\" a \"blessing indeed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Wilkinson, sin appears as a temporary interruption, requiring \nnothing more than a hurried reconciliation before the joyous flow of \nblessing continues. \"When you sin after experiencing the Jabez \nblessing\" you should \"rush back into God's presence and make things \nright.Don't squander even for a minute the miracle that He has \nstarted in your life. Indescribable good still lies ahead for you and \nyour family.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurgeon, on the other hand, knew that sin is much, much deeper than \nindividual temptations and actions that can be patched up by a \nsingle, perfunctory reconciliation. Its deep wound sometimes requires \nprotracted surgery. So he encouraged those who experienced \"dark \nnights of the soul\"nights that have no place in Wilkinson's \nschemewith these words: \"Though the harrow go over and over thy \nsoul, and the deep plough cut into thy very heart; though thou be \nmaimed and wounded, and left for dead, yet if the Spirit of God do \nit, it is a blessing indeed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis, though it will not sell millions of books as back-cover blurb \ncopy, is a message with depth and staying power. Sorrow can \nstrengthen faith. Affliction can be, as Spurgeon elsewhere put it, \n\"the best book in a minister's library.\" But 130 years of \nmiddle-class prosperity later, it seems millions of American \nChristians prefer instead to buy a book that downplays such godly \nsorrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information\u0014",

    "title": "SCHOOLED NOT TO BE FOOLED",
    "words": "Portrait: James Randi\u0014\nSchooled not to be fooled \u0014\n\u0014\nBY KIM CLARK, US News and World REport, 9/2/02\u0014\n\u0014\nFORT LAUDERDALE, FLA.Nearly every time James Randi goes to a \nrestaurant or a mall, somebody stops him to say that with his snowy \nbeard, balding pate, and smiling eyes, he should play Santa Claus. \nBoy, have they got the wrong guy. Randi sometimes snaps back, \"I \nhaven't heard that in . . . 20 minutes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, Randi can be quite jolly. As \"the Amazing Randi,\" his witty \nmagic routines cracked up Tonight Show audiences in the 1970s and \n'80s. And in his own cranky way, Randi has devoted the past 20 years \nto helping people. Of course, Randi's idea of \"helping\" is to \nfiercely debunk modern-day fairy tales: \"I go straight to the truth \nof the matter. A lot of people think this is not an approach that \nwins me friends. I'm not out to win friends. I can't do it any other \nway.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRandi's not such a grinch as to go after Santa. But his dogged \npursuit of spoon-bender Uri Geller and faith healer Peter Popoff, and \ncontinuing tests of self-proclaimed psychics, have won him a \nMacArthur \"genius\" grant and scientific acclaim as perhaps the \nworld's most important hoax-buster. \"Since the death of Carl [Sagan] \nand Stephen Jay Gould,\" says Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan, \"Randi is one \nof the very, very few left willing to stand up and challenge the \nnot-very-well-thought-out but well-accepted assumptions of society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRandi chokes up when he talks about the loss of friends and allies \nlike Sagan and Isaac Asimov. And that loneliness worries him. Though \nspry, Randi is 74. He wonders how long he can keep up his grinding \nschedule of testing (and flunking) dowsers (they think they \"feel\" \nunderground water by waving sticks above the ground), debating \npsychics on the Larry King show, and giving $7,500-a-pop lectures \nabout how easy it is to fool people. There are, of course, plenty of \nother hoax-bustersjust check the roster of the Committee for the \nScientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. But Randi fears \nnone have the showmanship or renown to get the message to the public.\u0014\n\u0014\nShoe biz. Randi believes passionately that the public needs more \nskepticism, since he feels surrounded by hoaxers. Literally. Across \nfrom his office is a chiropractor. \"Quackery,\" Randi says, using the \nharsh language that worries friends and has sparked several slander \nsuits. (The American Chiropractic Association says a federal agency \nfound spinal manipulation to be \"safe and effective\" in treating \nlower-back pain.) A nearby shoe store features a Florsheim display \nfor its \"MagneForce\" shoes with built-in magnets that will, \nallegedly, reduce foot pain. \"Pseudoscientific claptrap,\" Randi \ncharges. (John Florsheim declined to respond to Randi's criticism but \nplans to discontinue MagneForce products.) \u0014\n\u0014\nWorst of all is television. John Edward's \"talks\" with dead relatives \nof audience members on Crossing Over are a \"scam. . . . He plays 20 \nQuestions for millions of dollars.\" Randi charges that Edward makes \ngeneralizations that could apply to any number of people, such as \n\"I'm getting a name [from the beyond] that begins with M.\" Who \ndoesn't have a dead friend or relative whose name begins with M? \nRandi asks. Edward's spokeswoman declined to comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch incendiary indignation is nothing new for the man who was born \nRandall James Hamilton Zwinge. A lonely and troubled child prodigy, \nRandi found solace in magic tricks. His IQ was nearly off the charts, \nbut he didn't have many friends because he couldn't keep from \nimpatiently correcting Toronto teachers' and schoolmates' \ninaccuracies, or exposing deceptions. He loved learning magic because \nmagicians, he believes, are honest charlatans. They tell their \naudiences they are going to fool them. And they have the skills to \nidentify nefarious humbugs. When the teenage Randi was hauled off by \npolice for exposing \"tricks\" used by a spiritualist visiting a \nchurch, the boy's father gave him a paddling. Not long after, Randi \ndecided not to take his high school final exams and joined a \ntraveling carny as a magician. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Amazing Randi,\" as he billed himself, won notoriety for \nHoudini-like escapes from handcuffs and jails. His continuing passion \nfor debunking also drew attention. So when Uri Geller burst on the \nscene in 1972, Randi was called. Geller claimed his telekinetic \npowers were so strong that he could bend metal. He typically \ndemonstrated by seeming to melt a spoon just by rubbing it. Johnny \nCarson asked Randi to prepare a test for Geller's 1973 appearance on \nthe Tonight Show. Randi told the prop manager how to mark and secure \nthe spoons so Geller couldn't weaken them or prepare melted copies in \nadvance. As Carson's cameras rolled, Geller squirmed and concentrated \nbut bent not a single spoon. Geller later said Carson's skepticism \nblocked his powers. In a telephone interview this summer, Geller said \nthat his powers have been proven scientifically and that Randi \ncynically used him to further his own career. \"If I wasn't around, \nRandi would be some little tiny magician based out of New Jersey. \nToday he is like an old man frothing from his mouth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Randi's high profile, hoax-busting was unprofitable until \n1986. That's when he took on TV faith healer Peter Popoff. Suspecting \nthat Popoff's hearing aid was really a radio receiver, Randi got a \nprivate investigator to bring a scanner and tape recorder to the \nfaith-healing sessions. The scanner picked up Popoff's wife, \nElizabeth, calling, \"Petey, can you hear me?\" and reading information \naudience members had written on \"prayer cards\" or mentioned to \nushers. On the Tonight Show, Randi showed a clip of Popoff appearing \nto get an inspiration about a \"Harold\" in the audience. \"Cataracts,\" \nElizabeth relayed. \"God is going to burn those cataracts right off \nyour eyes!\" Popoff thundered. \"Popoff says God tells him these \nthings,\" Randi quipped. \"Maybe he does. But I didn't realize God used \na frequency of 39.17 megahertz and had a voice exactly like Elizabeth \nPopoff's.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPsychic challenge. Within months, Popoff was bankrupt. And Randi had \nwon his MacArthur award. Donors began contributing to his new \nfoundation, allowing Randi to devote himself full time to \nhoax-busting. He set up a \"million-dollar challenge\"to be paid from \nfoundation reserves to anyone who could offer scientific proof of his \nor her paranormal powers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, Randi has traveled the world investigating, and often \ndebunking, hundreds of people angling for the million, as well as \nanyone who makes a suspicious claim. Showing how \"psychic surgeons\" \nuse sleight of hand to make it appear they remove tumors without an \nincision from unsedated patients, Randi likes to pull a bloody glob \nout of the belly of a giggling volunteer, look shocked, and then say, \n\"That's not supposed to come out,\" and stuff it back in. He didn't \nneed to say a word to get a laugh out of the watchers of a Nova \ndocumentary when Russian \"face readers\" examined a picture of mass \nmurderer Ted Bundy and decided he was a \"leader.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs hard as Randi works, and as often as he succeeds, he admits he may \nnot be making a big dent in the overall level of hokum. Popoff is \nback on the air, he notes with a sigh. Geller bought a British soccer \nteam and hopes to inspire the players to win. Even Randi's foundation \nhas fallen victim to a hoax. Its endowment has fallen because of the \nstock market's Enron-related decline. Accounting sleight of hand, it \nseems, is beyond even the formidable powers of the Amazing Randi.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis entire issue was dedicated to hoaxes.\u0014",

    "words": "When Sir Winston Churchill visited Joseph Stalin at the Kremlin in \nAugust 1942, he asked the Soviet premier if the stresses of the \nongoing war were as terrible as those he had experienced a decade \nearlier when his government had collectivized Soviet agriculture \nforcibly. \"Oh, no,\" Stalin replied, \"the Collective Farm policy was a \nterrible struggle... Ten millions [dead],\" he said, holding up his \nhands. \"It was fearful. Four years it lasted. It was absolutely \nnecessary....\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a strange admission. One full year of total war was less \nterrible than the collectivization program? Yet it was true. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the centerpieces of Soviet communism was the concept of \ncollective agriculture. Instead of working small, private plots of \nland, farmers were to be joined in vast, supposedly more efficient \ncollectives. Some of the strongest resistance to this came from the \nUkraine. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1932, the Kremlin demanded that the Ukraine produce 44 percent \nmore grain, an extraordinarily high number. It essentially was a \ndeliberate attempt to kill off the resisting Ukrainian farmers, as \npart of the forced collectivization of agriculture. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoviet law stated emphatically that no grain could be given to feed \nthe peasants until the quota was met. Red Army troops, secret police \nunits, and local Communist party officials were used against peasants \nsuspected of hoarding grain, and an internal passport system was \nimplemented, restricting the movement of Ukrainian peasants so that \nthey could not travel in search of food. Ukrainian grain was \ncollected and stored in grain elevators that were guarded by military \nand secret police units while Ukrainians starved. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1933, Victor Kravchenko was one of the Communist agents assigned \nto safeguard the new harvest, the \"Harvest in Hell\" as he called it \nin his autobiography. \"The most terrifying sights were the little \nchildren with skeleton limbs dangling from balloon-like abdomens.\" \nHistorians estimate that Stalin's terror-famine cost the lives of \nsomewhere between five and ten million Ukrainians, but the precise \nfigures will never be known.\u0014",

    "words": "When Julius Caesar said, \"If you would have peace, prepare for war,\" \nhe might well have been describing Switzerland. Although there was a \nsmall civil war in 1847, Switzerland has not fought a war against \nanother country in 500 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nSwitzerland's neutrality comes from its unusual political structure \nas a loose federation of Catholic and Protestant states, known as \n\"cantons.\" To avoid internal conflict over whether to support \nCatholics or Protestants in the many religious wars going on in \nEurope during the 17th century, Switzerland officially declared \nneutrality, a policy it still maintains. During WWII, even Hitler \nleft Switzerland alone, despite much speculation that he would invade \n(though it has become apparent that, during the war, Swiss bankers \nhelped the Nazis loot accounts held by Jewish depositors, which has \ndamaged Switzerland's neutral reputation).\u0014\n\u0014\nSurrounded by the Alps, Switzerland has excellent natural defensive \nbarriers to protect its neutrality. They have been strengthened by \nhundreds of secret gun emplacements, air strips, and tank traps \nhidden within the mountains. Thousands of key points on the Swiss map \nare also heavily laden with explosive charges. If Switzerland were \ninvaded tomorrow morning, within a few hours hundreds of roads, \nbridges, and mountain passes would be blown up, rendering much of the \nnation impassable. \u0014\nEven if attackers could get through the mountain defenses, they'd \nstill have to face the Swiss army. The Swiss have a full-time \nprofessional army of only 3,400. However, over 650,000 Swiss citizens \n(overwhelmingly male) are members of the reserves--out of a total \npopulation of less than 7.5 million--and can be mobilized in less \nthan 48 hours. All soldiers must take their personal weapons and \nammunition home with them, to make mobilization easier.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmall wonder that no country has gone to war with the Swiss in 500 \nyears.\u0014",

    "words": "Standing Alone for Unity\u0014\nThe attempt to bring European Christians together forced one \u0014\nreformer, Caspar Schwenckfeld, straight to the fringe.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Elesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\n   Schwenckfelders have always been different. When Roman \u0014\n   Catholics and Lutherans battled over the pieces of modern \u0014\n   Germany during the Reformation era, Schwenckfelders did not \u0014\n   fit in either camp, so they experienced persecution from both \u0014\n   sides. From 1526 to 1895, Schwenckfelders, unlike almost all \u0014\n   other Christian groups, did not partake of Communion. Today, \u0014\n   whereas most Americans celebrate Thanksgiving in November with \u0014\n   turkey, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie, Schwenckfelders \u0014\n   celebrate in September (this weekend, in fact) with bread, \u0014\n   butter, and apple butter. Ironically, all of this has been \u0014\n   done in the name of a man with a passion for Christian unity.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Born into a noble Silesian family in 1489, Caspar Schwenckfeld \u0014\n   von Ossig was just slightly younger than Martin Luther. He \u0014\n   encountered Luther's writings as a young man and eagerly \u0014\n   joined the campaign for reform. He even traveled to Wittenberg \u0014\n   in 1525 to meet with Luther and his colleagues. \u0014\n\u0014\n   On several points, though, Schwenckfeld thought that Luther \u0014\n   had staked out a position too far removed from traditional \u0014\n   (Catholic) belief. Luther wanted a radical shift; Schwenckfeld \u0014\n   sought a \"Middle Way.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n   Specifically, Schwenckfeld questioned Luther's understanding \u0014\n   of faith and works. The medieval Catholic church, following \u0014\n   Galatians 5:6, taught that people are justified by faith \u0014\n   \"working through love\" (NKJV). Luther, following Ephesians \u0014\n   2:8, taught that people are justified by faith alone. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Schwenckfeld agreed with Luther that the medieval church \u0014\n   overemphasized works and wrongly pushed certain formal \u0014\n   practices, but he hesitated to jettison works entirely. \u0014\n   Surely, Schwenckfeld thought, good works must have some \u0014\n   purpose and meaning -- otherwise, what would be the point of \u0014\n   striving toward a godly life? Unfortunately, Reformation-era \u0014\n   conflicts did not leave room for a \"Middle Way.\" Both \u0014\n   Catholics and Lutherans accused Schwenckfeld and his followers \u0014\n   of collusion with the enemy. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Schwenckfeld also disagreed with Luther, and pretty much \u0014\n   everyone else in the sixteenth century, about Christ's body \u0014\n   and its relationship to the Communion elements. Schwenckfeld's \u0014\n   unusual (some would say heterodox) ideas on this topic are too \u0014\n   complicated to go into here, but their effect on Schwenckfeld \u0014\n   and his followers was remarkable.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Wrong doctrine taints Communion, Schwenckfeld wrote, but so \u0014\n   does a wrong attitude. Open hostility toward another group of \u0014\n   Christians constitutes a bad attitude. Therefore, as long as \u0014\n   Catholics, Lutherans, and other emerging Protestant groups \u0014\n   were accusing each other of profaning Communion, they were all \u0014\n   profaning Communion. In other words, there must be no fighting \u0014\n   at the Lord's table.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Schwenckfeld could not get all of the factions to agree about \u0014\n   Communion, so he declared that he could no longer partake of \u0014\n   it. Schwenckfelders maintained this stance, called the \u0014\n   Stillstand, until the eve of the twentieth century.\u0014\n\u0014\n   As their obscurity might suggest, Schwenckfelders did not get \u0014\n   very far in their quest to unite squabbling Christians. In the \u0014\n   1730s, after some 200 years of political setbacks and periodic \u0014\n   persecution in Europe, the tiny Schwenckfelder remnant fled to \u0014\n   religiously tolerant Pennsylvania. The largest group of \u0014\n   \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa, \n40 families, arrived in Philadelphia September 22, \u0014\n   1734.

He \u0014\n   wrote movingly of his desire \"that we may grow in the peace, \u0014\n   love, and unity which are in Christ, and live and walk in the \u0014\n   fear of God.\" The task was, and remains, harder than he could \u0014\n   have imagined. \u0014\n\u0014\n   Elesha Coffman is former managing editor of Christian History.\u0014\n\u0014\n   *Christian History issue 21:\u0014",

    "words": "So Much Can Come From our Choices\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to share with you a very real example of the impact that our \ndaily\u0014\nchoices makes on our future. This is a story of two close friends who \nwere\u0014\nteammates on a football team. Friends who shared a view of a promising\u0014\nfuture in professional sports and also who looked forward to continued\u0014\nsuccess during their collegiate career.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese two friends made separate choices November, 1998. One chose to \nstay at\u0014\nhome while the other decided to go hunting with two other friends. The\u0014\nhunting wasn't all that was on the list of activities though. These \nthree\u0014\ndrank heavily up into the early morning hours at which time they \ndecided to\u0014\ngo driving.\u0014\n\u0014\nJason Watts, the center of the Kentucky football team was the friend \nthat\u0014\nchose to drink and drive. While driving he lost control of his truck \nand a\u0014\nhorrible accident occurred. Watts and the other two friends were \nthrown from\u0014\nthe truck and all sustained injuries. Only Watts survived. The other \ntwo,\u0014\nalso legally drunk, lay dead on the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\nJason Watts went to court recently to face the consequences of his \nactions.\u0014\nHe was remorseful. He wished it had never happened, but it did. All \nbecause\u0014\nof his choice. He pleaded guilty to two counts of second degree \nmanslaughter\u0014\nand has been sentenced to 10 years in jail. His life is changed \nforever\u0014\nbecause of the impact of his choice that November night.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other teammate is Tim Couch. He had decided not to join the \nfriends that\u0014\nweekend. And in 1999 Tim was picked as the number one draft pick in \nthe NFL.\u0014\nHe signed a 7 year contract for a reported $48 Million dollars, \nincluding a\u0014\n$12.5 Million dollar signing bonus with the Cleveland Browns. His \nlife is\u0014\nalso now changed forever, in part preserved by his choice that \nNovember\u0014\nnight.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe future plans for these two teammates were disrupted and changed \nforever\u0014\ndue to these choices. The team had to face the next two games of the \nseason\u0014\nwithout the services of Watts at the center position and also with the\u0014\nheaviness of mourning and grief. They lost these last two games. Off \nthe\u0014\nfield, one teammate went on with his plans to wealth and success. \nWatts\u0014\nfaces jail and the loss of his dream to play professionally. Two other\u0014\nfamilies clutch their memories of their sons who were killed that \nnight,\u0014\nsons that will never touch a football again nor draw another breath.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo much can come from our choices.\u0014",

    "words": "People have clear expectations of the church. Although we cannot \nsacrifice or compromise the nonnegotiable of God's Word, we must \nseize the moment by using the resources, technology, and contemporary \nmethods available to us to reach a wounded, weary, and weak world in \ndesperate pursuit of the hope found in Jesus Christ. We must \nunashamedly adopt and embrace the following six principles if we \ntruly long to honor God with our best effort\u0014\n\u0014\n1. We must submit to Colossians 3:17 as our code of excellence. \nPeople look for and expect quality.\u0014\n2. We must become user friendly from the parking lot to the pew. We \nmust grow in our sensitivity to people's needs.\u0014\n3. We must submit to constant inspection and evaluation to ensure our \nsystematic effectiveness and technological readiness.\u0014\n4. We must embrace change as we grow in understanding peo- pIe's time \nlimitations. \"Unpredictability, constant change, chaos--they have all \nbecome the standard of our times. Instead of fearing them and \nfighting them, we must begin to use them for good, like the winds and \ntides that sailors use to get to their destination.\"\u0014\n5. We must develop and empower a large number of lay ministers \ncommitted to meeting people's diverse needs.\u0014\n6. We need to shift paradigms. Today's ministry using yesterday's \nmethods may not reach this generation for Christ.We must cherish our \nheritage and learn from our successes and failures while balancing \nour past with a passion for future excellence.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Alvin Toffler, in \"Future Shock\",  said, Change is avalanching \nupon our heads and most people are grotesquely unprepared to with \nit.\" Change is a nonnegotiable for the future.\u0014\n                                 --Tommy Teague\u0014",

    "title": "STARVATION",
    "words": "Starvation \u0014\n\u0014\nStarvation results from the inadequate intake of nutrients or the \ninability to metabolize or absorb nutrients. It can have a number of \ncauses such as prolonged fasting, anorexia, deprivation, or disease. \nNo matter what the cause, starvation takes about the same course and \nconsists of three phases. The events of the first two phases occur \neven during relatively short periods of fasting or dieting, but the \nthird phase occurs only in prolonged starvation and can end in death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the first phase of starvation, blood glucose levels are \nmaintained through the production of glucose from glycogen, proteins, \nand fats. At first glycogen is broken down into glucose. However, \nonly enough glycogen is stored in the liver to last a few hours. \nThereafter, blood glucose levels are maintained by the breakdown of \nproteins and fats. Fats are decomposed into fatty acids and glycerol. \nFatty acids can be used as a source of energy, especially by skeletal \nmuscle, thus decreasing the use of glucose by tissues other than the \nbrain. Glycerol can be used to make a small amount\u0014\nof glucose, but most of the glucose is formed from the amino acids of \nproteins. In addition, some amino acids can be used directly for \nenergy. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second stage, which can last for several weeks, fats are the \nprimary energy source. The liver metabolizes fatty acids into ketone \nbodies that can be used as a source of energy. After about a week of \nfasting, the brain begins to use ketone bodies, as wells as glucose, \nfor energy. This usage decrease the demand for glucose, and the rate \nof protein breakdown diminishes but does not stop. In addition, the \nproteins not essential for survival are used first. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe third stage of starvation begins when the fat reserves are \ndepleted and there is a switch to proteins as the major energy \nsource. Muscles, the largest source of protein in the body, are \nrapidly depleted. At the end of this stage, proteins, essential for \ncellular functions are broken down, and cell function degenerates. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to weigh loss, symptoms of starvation include apathy, \nlistlessness, withdrawal, and increased susceptibility to infectious \ndisease. Few people die directly from starvation because they usually \ndie of some infectious disease first.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther signs of starvation can include changes in hair color, flaky \nskin, and massive edema in the abdomen and lower limbs, causing the \nabdomen to appear bloated. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the process of starvation, the ability of the body to consume \nnormal volumes of food also decreases. \u0014\n\u0014\nFoods high in bulk but low in protein content often cannot reverse \nthe process of starvation. Intervention involves feeding the starving \nperson low-bulk food that provides ample proteins and kilo-calories \nand is fortified with vitamins and minerals. The process of \nstarvation also results in dehydration, and dehydration is an \nimportant part of intervention. Even with intervention, a victim may \nbe so affected by disease or weakness that he cannot recover.\u0014",

The \ninmates, all female, are the victims of a stringently moralistic \nbrand of Irish Catholicism, now on the wane, that used to punish \nunmarried young women (many in their teens) for premarital sex. Some \nare confined simply because their frightened puritanical families \nconsider them too unruly.\u0014\nThese \"bad girls\" exiled from their families and communities, often \nafter becoming pregnant out of wedlock, were forced to do slave labor \nin convent laundries that proliferated in Ireland until recently. The \nexistence of these religious labor camps run by the Sisters of the \nMagdalene Order came to light only in the 1970's with the discovery \nof the unmarked graves of women who lived there.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the scandal broke, the laundries were closed, the last in 1996. \nSome 30,000 women are thought to have passed through their gates.\u0014\nOnce incarcerated, the women were forced to toil long hours under \nclose guard doing unpaid work that was deemed fitting penitence for \ntheir sins. In the movie's early scenes, the work is done with \nwashboards and tubs. The arrival of washing machines made the labor \nsomewhat less arduous.\u0014\n\u0014\nForbidden to talk while on the job, the prisoners were continually \nharangued by the nuns in charge about their sins and the unlikelihood \nof salvation. Disobedience was punished with beatings and the \nshearing of their hair. Although some of these outcasts were \neventually reclaimed by family members, others were simply abandoned \nto spend the rest of their lives behind locked institutional doors.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Magdalene Sisters,\" which tells the semifictionalized stories of \nfour young women in one convent, is set roughly from 1964 to 1969. \nThe movie, which the New York Film Festival is screening this evening \nand tomorrow afternoon at Alice Tully Hall (it recently won the top \nprize at the Venice Film Festival), observes the narrative \nconventions of most prison movies. There are small rebellions, failed \nescape attempts, furtive alliances and punishments so harsh they make \nyou wince. Only the plucky and the fortunate find their way out of \ncaptivity. In one of the most harrowing scenes, a young woman flees, \nonly to be dragged back, screaming and flailing, by her brutal, \nunforgiving father.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost prison movies have a monster authority figure, and so does \"The \nMagdalene Sisters.\" Here that ogre is the head nun, Sister Bridget \n(Geraldine McEwan), a twisted diabolical autocrat who gets gurgly and \nteary-eyed over Ingrid Bergman in \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" and keeps \na picture of John F. Kennedy in her room. But when the rules of her \nlittle fief are flouted, Sister Bridget turns into a vengeful demon. \nIn a brilliant performance, Ms. McEwan makes this character horribly \nbelievable by portraying her cruelty not as raw sadism but as \nrighteous punishment dispensed by a religious fanatic with a warped \nsense of values.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Magdalene Sisters\" more than fulfills the promise of Mr. \nMullan's audacious feature film debut, \"Orphans,\" a rough-hewn \nsurreal family comedy first shown here three years ago in the New \nDirectors/New Films series. If Mr. Mullan's screenplay avoids the \nlurid shock tactics of conventional women's prison movies, that's not \nto say the movie doesn't include some appalling images.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a humiliating exercise calculated to instill maximum body shame \nand self-loathing, the women, naked and lined up for their morning \ncalisthenics, are sarcastically evaluated as physical specimens by a \nnun who points out the ones with the largest buttocks and breasts and \nthe most pubic hair. In another scene Sister Bridget flies into a \nrage, seizes a pair of scissors and hacks off the hair of a \nrebellious young woman with a fury that leaves blood streaming from \nthe girl's scalp into her eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe movie begins with sketchy vignettes that suggest how three of the \nwomen ended up in the convent. Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is raped \nduring a wedding party by a drunken cousin and makes the mistake of \nconfiding in a friend. As word spreads among the celebrants, the \nmen's accusing faces reveal that they blame Margaret for the assault, \nand sometime later she is summarily dispatched by her father to the \nconvent, where she is given a brown sack of a uniform, shown into a \nshabby dormitory and indoctrinated into the harshly regimental \nroutine.\u0014\nNext is Rose, an unwed mother shown cuddling her beautiful baby boy \nand tearfully pleading with her parents to accept the child. \nStone-faced, they refuse even to look at her, and she is hustled off \nto the convent, where she is renamed Patricia. The only sin \napparently committed by Bernadette, the most defiant of the new \narrivals, is being a magnet for adolescent male attention. When she \narrives at the convent, Sister Bridget fixes a contemptuous gaze on \nthe girl and denounces her as a temptress. Determined to escape, \nBernadette flirts with a gawky youth who delivers the laundry, \npromising him sexual favors if he will help her escape, but he loses \nhis nerve.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, there is Crispina (Eileen Walsh), a sweet, simple-minded \ngirl (and the unwed mother of a young boy) who becomes unstrung when \nher only worldly possession, a St. Christopher's medal, is stolen. \nThe most vulnerable of the four, Crispina meets the cruelest fate \nafter revealing she was sexually abused by a priest.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Magdalene Sisters\" would be too painful to watch if it didn't \nhave a silver lining. Suffice it say that it is possible to fly over \nthis religious cuckoo's nest and remain free. All it takes is courage \nand the timely kindness of strangers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE MAGDALENE SISTERS\u0014\nWritten and directed by Peter Mullan; director of photography, Nigel \nWilloughby; edited by Colin Monie; music by Craig Armstrong; produced \nby Frances Higson; released by Miramax Films.

    "title": "ST. CHRISTOPHER?  NOT LIKELY BUT NOT THE DEVIL EITHER",
    "words": "St. Christopher?\u0014\n\u0014\nBY Doug Weaver\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What some historians have termed a 'discovery,' in reality was an \ninvasion\u0014\nand colonization with legalized occupation, genocide, economic \nexploitation,\u0014\nand a deep level of institutional racism and moral decadence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo stated the National Council of Churches in 1992 as America \nprepared to\u0014\ncelebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the New \nWorld. On\u0014\nthe other hand, President George Bush (Sr.) said that Columbus Day \nhonored\u0014\n\"one of the greatest achievements of human endeavor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo radically different assessments. Which one is correct?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristoforo Colombo dreamed of discovering a trade route to the \nOrient that\u0014\nwould bring him glory and untold wealth. On Oct. 12, 1492, when the\u0014\nexperienced mariner found America, he thought he was in the isles of \nthe\u0014\nIndes (and thus named the natives \"Indians\").\u0014\n\u0014\nColumbus named the island on which he landed \"San Salvador\" (Holy \nSavior),\u0014\nannounced that the lands were the property of the Catholic government \nof\u0014\nSpain, and believed that he had discovered a gold mine. The crew \nmembers\u0014\nthat were left behind, in their search for gold, pillaged and \nmassacred the\u0014\nnatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome historians have concluded that Columbus was motivated by fame \nand raw\u0014\ngreed. Other historians see more complex motives and point out \nColumbus'\u0014\nstrong religious piety.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe exhibited strict religious habits. According to his son, Columbus \nwas\u0014\nlike a monk in his devotion to fasting and prayer. He was a serious \nstudent\u0014\nof the Bible and, as might be expected, was devoted to the medieval \nchurch.\u0014\nThe crews of his ships regularly observed religious rituals, and \nColumbus\u0014\ntestified that he frequently heard the voice of God (and critics \nobviously\u0014\npoint to stress or mental instability).\u0014\n\u0014\nReflecting on his travels, Columbus clearly viewed his voyages in \nexplicitly\u0014\nreligious terms. They were evangelistic missions to expand \nChristianity.\u0014\nThey were part of God's plan to preach the gospel to every creature \nand\u0014\nwould thus help usher in the imminent end of time.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo extend Spain's Catholic borders in the New World was to spread the \nfaith.\u0014\nTo conquer natives was to make good Christians and to make good slaves\u0014\n(similar logic was used in the slave trade in the American South).\u0014\n\u0014\nConsequently, Columbus placed a large wooden cross on every island he\u0014\nvisited and, in 1493, asked the Spanish government to set aside one \npercent\u0014\nof all the gold taken from the islands to pay for religious work \nthere.\u0014\nUltimately he took satisfaction that his travels fulfilled \nScriptures, such\u0014\nas John 10:16: \"and other sheep I have, which are not of this fold, \nthem\u0014\nalso I must bring ...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians who try to balance Columbus' motives admit that the \nexplorer was\u0014\nobsessed by greed. They contend, however, that Columbus was not \nsimply out\u0014\nfor personal gain, but was driven by the desire to fund a crusade to\u0014\nrecapture the Holy Land from Muslims. He believed God had chosen \nFerdinand\u0014\nand Isabella, the Spanish monarchs, to lead this holy endeavor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do we make of Christopher Columbus? Prominent historian Martin \nMarty\u0014\nsaid: \"Some historians make Europeans all evil and the American \nnatives all\u0014\ngood. Likewise, Columbus used to be overpraised as the perfect \npioneer. Now\u0014\nhe is often overaccused as the hemisphere's arch-villain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen telling the story of Columbus, the religious element cannot be \nleft\u0014\nout. Assessments of the effect of religion on Columbus, however, are \nmixed.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid he read too much religion later in life back into his story? It \nwon't be\u0014\nthe first time. Did his biographers too quickly exalt his piety? \nPerhaps.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut more to the point, Columbus evidently was typical in many \nregards. He\u0014\nwas a person of mixed motives: a man of greed and a man of faith. \nPersonal\u0014\nwealth and religious zeal make it easy to say that God is on my side.\u0014\nPerhaps more than anything, Columbus teaches us that the crusading \nspirit in\u0014\nreligion is fraught with dangers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne thing is clear: Columbus is an ambiguous figure. He was a sinful \nsaint\u0014\nand a saintly sinner.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoug Weaver is professor of Christianity and chair of the religion and\u0014\nphilosophy division at Brewton-Parker College in Mt. Vernon, Ga.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote: Christian History magazine\u0014",

    "title": "SEQUOYAH:THE MAN WHO INVENTED A WRITTEN LANGUAGE",
    "words": "A great deal of what we know about the traditions of the Native \nAmerican Cherokee tribe can be attributed to one man: Sequoyah (c. \n1770-1843), the only person known to have invented a written \nlanguage. \u0014\n\u0014\nSequoyah, born to a Virginia fur trader and the daughter of a \nCherokee chief, was born lame--the name Sequoyah is Cherokee for \"pig \nfoot.\" He became a silversmith in Georgia, learning how to sign his \nname to his work from a colonist. That's when he came up with the \nidea of creating Cherokee writing. He became so obsessed with the \nidea of a written Indian language that he practically forgot about \nhis farm and family. Considered dangerously strange, he was even \naccused of witchcraft.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Sequoyah's phonetic system--each sound made in speech was \nrepresented by a symbol--was quickly embraced by the Cherokees. He \nperfected his syllabary, or set of 85 symbols, which he called the \n\"talking leaves,\" around 1819-1821. With it, any Cherokee speaker \ncould quickly learn to read and write. Twelve years after the initial \nidea, the Cherokee Nation adopted it and thousands of Cherokees \nlearned to read and write. Cherokees established a press and \npublished their own newspaper, The Cherokee Phoenix, in English and \nCherokee. In it, they translated and published parts of the Bible, \nnew laws, a hymnbook, and pamphlets. They also began to write down \ntheir medicinal formulas and sacred literature.\u0014\n \u0014\nBy the time Sequoyah traveled to Washington, DC, in 1828 as a tribal \nrepresentative, the Cherokees had built roads and schools, and \ndeveloped their own system of representational government. Sequoyah's \n\"talking leaves\" revealed the richness of Native American culture \nthat otherwise would have been lost. His legacy was extended further \nwhen the giant redwood tree, and the national park in California \nknown for the redwoods, was given the name sequoia.\u0014",

    "title": "SPEAKING AGAINST THE LYNCHINGS--IDA B. WELLS",
    "words": "At around 3 AM on March 9, 1892, a mob stormed a Memphis prison, \nseized three black prisoners, and executed them in a field. Vigilante \nacts such as this, in which police collaborated with lynchings, were \nnot uncommon in the South at that time. History might have forgotten \nthe incident had it not been for African-American activist Ida B. \nWells (1862-1931).\u0014\n\u0014\n Thomas Moss, one of the lynching victims, was Wells's close friend \nand she was the godmother of his child. An editor and investigative \njournalist, Wells used her Memphis newspaper, The Free Speech, as a \nsoapbox to speak out against lynching. Her voice was essential to \nchallenging the practice, which was becoming increasingly \ncommonplace. Historians now estimate that during this period \n(1880-1930) over 3,200 blacks and 700 whites were lynched. This was \nnot the first time that Wells had publicly spoken out against racism. \nAt the age of 22, she was asked to move from the \"ladies car\" of a \ntrain into the smoking car because of her race. She sued the company \nfor discrimination, and won the first round of her case before losing \nin a state appeals court. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Moss's death, Wells began delivering anti-lynching lectures to \naudiences across the country. In 1895 she published A Red Record, a \nbook listing every lynching that had taken place during the three \nprevious years. By carefully recording the circumstances of each \ncase, she proved that the justifications used by Southerners--such as \nthe need to maintain order or protect white women--were pure \nfabrications. Wells did not live to see the end of lynching, which \nlasted into the 1960s. But she was a heroic pioneer of the civil \nrights movement, and she was one of the founders of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which \ncarries on the struggle for racial justice to this day.\u0014",

    "words": "Separation of Church and State: An Important \nBaptist Distinctive \u0014\n\u0014\n                     By Bill Brian, Co-Chair \u0014\n\u0014\n                     \u0014\n                     Following early worship and Bible Study in my \nown church, I went to a\u0014\n                     sister church to hear David Barton deliver a \nmessage to the large\u0014\n                     congregation gathered there (his second such \nmessage of the day),\u0014\n                     that sounded un-Baptist on the subject of \nchurch-state reseparation.\u0014\n                     Mr. Barton stated that he speaks to about 400 \ngroups per year. I\u0014\n                     happened to tune in C-SPAN on cable television, \na few months ago,\u0014\n                     and saw Mr. Barton testifying before a \nCongressional committee. The\u0014\n                     name of his organization is Wallbuilders, but \nhis message is that\u0014\n                     church-state separation is a myth and that the \nframers of our\u0014\n                     Constitution never intended a \"wall of \nseparation\" between church\u0014\n                     and state. This famous quote is from Thomas \nJefferson's 1802 letter\u0014\n                     to Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut. According \nto Mr. Barton,\u0014\n                     Jefferson's view was far from reflecting the \nintent of the other\u0014\n                     founders of our nation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Mr. Barton's style is to move very fast through \nhis presentation, to\u0014\n                     begin by showing slides and suggesting the deep \nreligious\u0014\n                     commitment of the earliest English settlers in \nAmerica  specifically,\u0014\n                     those who settled in Plymouth and the \nMassachusetts Bay Colony.\u0014\n                     The April 1997 issue of \"THEREFORE...\", \nnewsletter of the Christian\u0014\n                     Life Commission of our BGCT, observes that Mr. \nBarton presents\u0014\n                     \"[t]he appearance of...scholarly work. However, \nupon closer scrutiny,\u0014\n                     the fabrication begins to fall apart.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Mr. Barton declared to his Amarillo audience \nthat the Puritans left\u0014\n                     England, seeking religious freedom. While they \ndid, indeed, flee\u0014\n                     England in order to establish a \"new Israel\" in \nAmerica, the irrefutable\u0014\n                     record shows that they were no champions of \nreligious freedom.\u0014\n                     They wanted religious freedom only for \nthemselves. No mention was\u0014\n                     made by Barton that it was the Puritans who \nexpelled Roger Williams,\u0014\n                     organizer of the very first Baptist church in \nAmerica, because\u0014\n                     Williams's teachings were \"subversive and \nWilliams would undermine\u0014\n                     the very foundations of the Puritan theocracy.\"1\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Neither did Barton mention Baptists like Isaac \nBackus, who said of\u0014\n                     Williams: \"...[H]e overcame evil with good, \nwhile the advocates for the\u0014\n                     use of secular force in religion hath requited \nhim and his friends evil\u0014\n                     for good ever since.\"2\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Nor Baptist pastor John Leland, who joined \nBackus to help pull down\u0014\n                     establishment of the Episcopal church in our \nfledgling nation. Leland\u0014\n                     wrote to James Madison expressing his objections \nto the U.S.\u0014\n                     Constitution which then had no Bill of Rights. \nLeland wrote: \"What is\u0014\n                     clearest of all  Religious Liberty, is not \nsufficiently secured....\"3\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Mr. Barton summed up his remarks by calling for \nthe election of\u0014\n                     public officials who are religious. We can agree \nwith Barton that as\u0014\n                     followers of Christwe should never neglect to \nvote. We should also\u0014\n                     exercise our best judgment in doing so, but the \nframers of our\u0014\n                     Constitution saw the wisdom of prohibiting a \nreligious test as a\u0014\n                     qualification for holding public office. \"4\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Finally, Mr. Barton called America back to a \n\"Hebrew republic.\"5\u0014\n                     Compare that call to these words of Leland:\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I now call for an instance, where Jesus Christ, \nthe author of his\u0014\n                     religion, or the apostles, who were divinely \ninspired, ever gave orders\u0014\n                     to, or intimated, that the civil powers on \nearth, ought to force people\u0014\n                     to observe the rules and doctrine of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Mahomet called in the use of the law and sword, \nto convert people to\u0014\n                     his religion; but Jesus did not  does not.\"6\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Responding to the Puritan notion of Israel as a \nmodel for\u0014\n                     church-state relations, Roger Williams said:\u0014\n\u0014\n                     We know the allegations against this counsel [of \nmine]: the\u0014\n                     [archetype of such practice] is from Moses [not \nChrist], his pattern is\u0014\n                     the typical land of Canaan, the kings of Israel \nand Judah, &c. We\u0014\n                     believe [that this] will be found [to be] but \none of Moses' shadows\u0014\n                     which vanished at the coming of the Lord Jesus  \nyet such a shadow\u0014\n                     as is directly opposite to the very testament \nand coming of the Lord\u0014\n                     Jesus. [It is] opposite to the very nature of a \nChristian Church, the\u0014\n                     only holy nation and Israel of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Listening to David Barton reminded me of the old \nadage that the best\u0014\n                     defense is a good offense. Mr. Barton went on \nthe offense by\u0014\n                     claiming that there are those who would revise \nthe history books. He\u0014\n                     claimed that the revisionists seek to erect a \nwall of separation\u0014\n                     between church and state. Those who tell us of \nthe deep roots of\u0014\n                     church-state separation planted by our Baptist \nforebears are\u0014\n                     certainly not the ones who are attempting to \nrevise history. The late\u0014\n                     Herschel Hobbs, author of The Baptist Faith & \nMessage, said in the\u0014\n                     section of that work on religious liberty:\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Religious liberty does not rest upon a legal \ndocument of a political\u0014\n                     state. It is rooted in the Bible. Freedom is \ninherent in man's nature as\u0014\n                     God created him (Genesis 1:27).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Church and state are mutually related in the \nnormal affairs of life.\u0014\n                     The state provides a favorable atmosphere in \nwhich the church can\u0014\n                     do its work (such as fire and police protection, \nnational security,\u0014\n                     postal service, roads and streets, general \nsocial stability). And the\u0014\n                     churches, in turn, should produce through the \ngospel the type of\u0014\n                     Christian citizens which will contribute to a \nstable social order.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     At the same time church and state are mutually \nexclusive. Neither\u0014\n                     should seek to control the other or to use it in \nfilling its peculiar role.\u0014\n                     Neither should propose to tell the other how to \ndischarge its\u0014\n                     responsibility. The church should not seek to \nuse the state for its\u0014\n                     purposes. The state should not commandeer the \nchurch for political\u0014\n                     ends. The state should not favor one religion \nabove another. It is the\u0014\n                     opinion of this writer that no taxes should be \nlevied against property\u0014\n                     used strictly for religious purposes. The \nchurches should not receive\u0014\n                     tax funds for use in discharging their \neducational, healing, or spiritual\u0014\n                     responsibility. The church should be free to \ndetermine its programs\u0014\n                     of worship, evangelism, and missionary \nactivities.7\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Texas Baptists Committed seeks to uphold \nhistoric Baptist principles,\u0014\n                     including those of religious liberty and the \nseparation of church and\u0014\n                     state. Knowing that the views of David Barton \nare proclaimed from\u0014\n                     the pulpit of a large Baptist church in my city \nreminds me of the\u0014\n                     importance of understanding who we are and who \nwe have been as\u0014\n                     Baptists. I am grateful for the steady focus of \nour BGCT Christian Life\u0014\n                     Commission and the Baptist Join Committee on \nPublic Affairs, both\u0014\n                     proclaiming, year after year, the singular \nimportance of religious\u0014\n                     liberty for all Americans. As we prepare to \ncelebrate our nation's\u0014\n                     independence on July 4, let us recall the \nsacrifices made by Baptists\u0014\n                     in the early days of our country, who knew first \nhand the tyranny of a\u0014\n                     religious majority and who gave to us what some \nobservers have\u0014\n                     called the unique contribution of the American \nexperience to world\u0014\n                     government  the separation of church and state \nand religious\u0014\n                     liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                          1 Estep, Revolution Within The Revolution, \n1990, William B.\u0014\n                          Eerdmans Publishing Co., p. 77\u0014\n\u0014\n                          2 Backus, Government and Liberty Described, \nin Isaac Backus\u0014\n                          on Church, State, and Calvinism: Pamphlets \n1754-1789.

    "words": "Starbucks Spirituality\u0014\n\u0014\nPostmoderns have three questions for Christians that you'd better be \nready for.\u0014\nby Brett Lawrence\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel Hill holds a steady part-time job working one or two shifts a \nweek at Starbucks. It's hardly a career-track position, and it's not \nthat he needs the extra cash or battles a secret caffeine addiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's the people.\u0014\n\u0014\nPurple hair, belly-button rings, tattoos, black-painted \nfingernailsthose people.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Hill, whose day job is ministering on staff with Willow Creek \nCommunity Church's Axis outreach, Starbucks provides a context to \nbuild meaningful relationships with postmodern, Gen-Next \ntwentysomethings who are far from God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nothing has been more transforming for me than working at \nStarbucks,\" says Hill, \"These people matter to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the moonlighting gig isn't a free pass to easy evangelism. His \ncoffee colleagues are like a good cup of triple espressoplenty of \nsteam, a little bitter, and enough kick to knock you on your backside \nif you aren't careful.\u0014\n\u0014\nExhibit A: \"The first day Debbie worked at Starbucks, one of the \nshift supervisors points at me and asks her, 'Did you hear what his \nreal job is?' After she hears I work at a church, Debbie freaks out. \nShe says, 'Three years ago my 16-year-old daughter was raped and \nmurdered. Tell me, what kind of God would let that happen? I believe \nin God. I just have a real problem with him.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHill isn't alone in facing these kinds of questions. Suspicion and \ndistrust of Christians, and wariness of God are readily observed.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the bumper sticker: \"Dear God, please save me from your \nfollowers.\" Or the ubiquitous Christian \"fish\" that has mysteriously \ngrown feet courtesy of the Darwinian crowda symbol of faith \nsarcastically twisted by the culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Christian bookstores carry such titles as: \"Following Jesus \nWithout Embarrassing God,\" \"Toxic Faith,\" and \"The Subtle Power of \nSpiritual Abuse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith fingers pointed at Christians, we're obliged to identify the \nunderlying accusations and offer a response. Three questions are at \nthe core.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy should I trust you?\u0014\nDaniel Hill suggests that 90 percent of the accusations Christians \nface are rooted in mistrust. \"I don't find that people have a problem \nwith Jesus,\" he says. \"They have a problem with Christians.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnyone who claims authority todaypoliticians, parents, or \npastorswill face the question of trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nRick Richardson, author of Evangelism Outside the Box and \nInterVarsity Christian Fellowship's national field director for \nevangelism, observes: \"When people ask questions about homosexuality, \nfor instance, we're tempted to think they're asking questions about \nright and wrong. But they're not. They're asking about dominance and \noppression.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Homosexual strugglers look at what the church has done to women, \nthey look at slavery, at this history of collaboration between \nChristian faith and Western dominanceand they say, 'In light of \nthat, how can I trust you?'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf that's the question, how can we respond?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer requires more than words. Christians, with PowerPoint \npresentations and four-point evangelistic outlines, have mastered the \nart of proclamation. But words alone aren't going to answer the trust \nquestion.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrust is built by actions, not words.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're supposed to proclaim the kingdom of God and demonstrate the \nkingdom of God,\" says Soong-Chan Rah, pastor of the Cambridge \nCommunity Fellowship Church near Boston. \"Evangelism for our \ngeneration means learning to do both.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Part of proclamation means that we speak the whole gospel of Christ, \nnot just the Westernized version of it. We also need to be good at \ndemonstrationbringing healing to our sick society and at-risk \nneighborhoods, bringing wholeness not just to the spiritually lost \nbut also to those who are under economic oppression.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most fundamental ways to represent God's kingdom is by \nbeing kind to the disaffected, even when we have genuine \ndisagreements with the way they choose to live.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Valerie Zander, who works with a team to develop neighborhood \nchurches in the San Francisco area, this means working with people \nwho are homosexual.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The question is, 'Do I offer genuine friendship and companionship to \npeople who are gay?'\" Zander says. \"If you're a believer, the answer \nto that question is yes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have a lesbian friend who told me, 'I'm expecting.' She was \nwatching closely to see how I responded. Would I tell her she \nshouldn't be raising a child, or would I be excited for her?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I had to ask myself, Does my friend want my approval? Does giving it \nto her salve her conscience? Will she say, 'Oh see, look, she's a \npastor's wife and she thinks it's okay?'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nZander came down on the side of kindness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I decided in my life, in profound ways, I believe children are a \ngift from God. I truly believe that I would not be the kind of person \nI am becoming if I had not had children. So I said, 'I'm happy for \nyou because children are a gift from God.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn whatever way we respond, the one thing we can't do is ignore the \ntrust issue.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's often the question behind the question,\" says Richardson. \n\"Because a lot of these are accusations against the church. Whenever \nyou try to address them without addressing the trust issue they can't \nhear you,\" he says. \"So I always start by listening and validating \nthe questions and identifying why people would have trust issues.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not going to defend Christianity's marriage to Western European \ndomination. I don't care where you come down on specific issues, such \nas sexism, for instance. You have to take seriously the trust issues \npeople have with the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let people know you've heard them and that you have compassion for \nthe hurts people experience.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIsn't that just your reality?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Evangelism Outside the Box, Richardson tells about an encounter \nwith Bob, a philosophy of science student at the University of \nIllinois. Bob was dating a girl from Richardson's InterVarsity group, \nand she asked Richardson to talk with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Richardson began discussing evidence for the resurrection and \nJesus' desire to have a relationship with us, Bob responded with an \nextended monologue of his own.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe touched on Einstein's theories and introduced the findings of \nscientists Niels Bohr, Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg. Then Bob got \ndownright evangelistic.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Quantum theory has immense consequences for our view of reality,\" \nBob explained. \"First, logic can no longer be seen as either/or. You \ncan't say either Christianity is true or it's false. Reality is \nalso/and. Light is a wave, and it's also a particle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So when you give me your arguments, you're operating with that \nold-time dichotomizing logic that went out with the downfall of Isaac \nNewton's world of simple, certain scientific truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Second, all reality is participant reality. There is no such thing \nas an independent, objective world that you can observe without \nchanging it. You can't measure light particles without changing them, \nwithout creating the reality you observe. You probably want to make \nme think the early Christians just reported the historical facts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They helped create the facts they observed, and then reported them \nout of their interpretation of reality. Scientists do that. Writers \ndo that. Religious people like you do that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news, Richardson says, is that accusations related to the \nradical changes in science during the twentieth century and \nobjections to Christians' claims of truth don't necessarily require a \ndoctoral-level understanding of quantum physics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What you're really arguing for,\" says Richardson, \"is an \nacknowledgement that reality isn't just inside you. It's also outside \nyou.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The reality of God is out there. I work hard with people hereto get \nthem out of their total experience orientation. If all you seek is \nexperience, if you're just looking for what's true for you, it's a \nself-defeating search. Reality is something you find while you're \nseeking something else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Starbucks-serving Daniel Hill says that the \"whatever works for \nyou\" mentality is a foundational part of the postmodern mindset. \nStill, he says, it can be fruitless to engage that argument directly.\u0014\n\u0014\nHill calls the postmodern mindset \"kind of the air they breathe\" \nrather than a deep-seated philosophical barrier to faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've never been able to persuade someone intellectually to abandon \nthe relativistic mindset,\" he says. \"That's never the doorway I get \nsomeone to walk through. What's more likely to happen is that they'll \nsee the power of a transformed life in another Christ follower and be \ntransformed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHill says we also do well to remember that relativism has its plus \nside.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People are open to Jesus,\" he says. \"They just don't consider him \nthe only way. I try to engage them in who Jesus is and not that the \nothers aren't correct.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat good is Christianity?\u0014\n\u0014\nRichardson calls this the question of utility and relevance. Does \nyour belief change lives? Does your religion work? Does it help me, \nwhether I'm in your group or not? Or are you just another \nself-serving group?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The question of the uniqueness of Christ is not primarily \nphilosophical,\" he writes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People are not looking for theological comparisons but for \nattractiveness, relevance, and usefulness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKaty, a business consultant in Washington, D.C., had been hearing the \nrat-a-tat-tat of a recurring message for five years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our role on earth is to take on suffering and allow ourselves to \nbecome agents of God's redemption,\" her young adult pastor would say. \n\"Seek out the pain of the world so you can engage it and see the Lord \nredeem it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, two young girls in Washington's inner-city are grateful that \nKaty was listening.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Our young adults group started a mentoring program in Anacostia, the \nmurder capital of the murder capital of the country,\" explains Bill \nHaley, the source of Katy's five-year echo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It became very clear that at one point, the mother of the little \ngirl she was mentoring was going to need alcohol rehab, and the \nlittle girl and her sister were going to need someone to take care of \nthem.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKaty volunteered, thinking it was a six-week commitment, and then \nwatched that short-term assignment stretch into more than two years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She eventually needed to quit her job as a business consultant to \ntake care of these two children,\" says Haley, director of urban \nministry at the D.C.-area Falls Church. \"We lay down our own \ninterests for the sake of coming to the aid of those who would have \nno other help. That's an incarnation of the life of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's also an effective response to the third question of the \npostmodern culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe the greatest apologetic for this day is the apologetic of \nJesus and the early church,\" says Haley, who lives with his wife in \ninner-city D.C.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Simply put: Being a Christian means following Jesus. If our \ndiscipleship is not leading us to continue to give away our lives to \nother people, at great personal cost, then we are not following Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a fundamental call to Christians to be involved in generous \ncompassion to the poor and the broken and the underprivileged. \nThere's more in the Bible about justice and compassion than \nevangelism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat they can't argue with\u0014\n\u0014\nIn today's culture there will always be questions and \naccusationssome fair, others unfair; some informed, others ignorant.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs ministers of the gospel, what is our response?\u0014\n\u0014\nHill suggests the best way may also be the simplest.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Be intentional and authentic in your friendship,\" he says. \"Their \nresponse to my overtures can't determine whether we stay in \nfriendship. If it does, then it's not a friendship but a manipulative \nploy to get them to become a Christian. It's a difficult paradox to \nreconcile.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEspecially when abstract discussions about cultural accusations turn \npersonal, and real people and eternity hang in the balance.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember Debbie, the woman whose daughter was raped and murdered? \nMore than a year and a half after they met, Hill is still working on \nthat friendship, reaching out, extending a hand of grace. He asked \nher to tell her story at church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"During one of our Axis messages recently, we were asking, 'How do \nyou find God in the midst of pain?'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I asked Debbie to come and share her story, and she did. She tells \nthis gripping story of loss and hurt and pain, and everyone was \nwaiting for the end of the story,\" he explains. \"But she finished by \nsaying, 'I have a real problem with God.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's not the end of the story,\" Hill says. \"It's the middle.\"\u0014\nBrett Lawrence a former youth minister, is a writer in Newark, Ohio.\u0014",

But studying on \nhis own, spurgeon developed such biblical skills that his sermons \nwere published weekly for forty years, selling 150 million copies in \nEurope and America. In addition to all this, spurgeon wrote 135 books.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of his blindness, John Milton wrote Paradise Lost and \nParadise Regained. Beethoven, at forty-two, lost his hearing. But he \ncontinued to write deathless music.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president, had less than one year of \nformal schooling. But when he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, \nhe set four million black slaves free.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor Thomas Gray had a melancholic temperament and once wrote that \n\"low spirits are my true and faithful companions.\" But he succeeded \nin spite of his melancholy.\u0014\n\u0014\nCervantes started Don Quixote while he was a prisoner. John Bunyan \nwrote The Pilgrim's Progress while he was in Bedford Jail. And the \napostle Paul wrote one third of his New Testament Epistles while he \nwas a Roman prisoner.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIlliam WIlberforce carried on a relentless attack against the \nBritish slave trade. Sick and under a doctor's care for twenty years, \nhe took just enough opium to keep going. He had the courage never to \nincrease the dosage.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn outstanding Englishman who went one day to hear Wilberforce speak \nlater said: \"I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; \nbut, as I listened, he grew until the shrimp became a whale .\" He \nsucceeded in spite of his problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nVictor Hugo, France's most popular literary figure, was exiled by \nEmperor Napoleon ill for his political beliefs.

    "title": "SELDOM WHAT WE EXPECTED BUT OFTEN WHAT WE NEED",
    "words": "Exactly the Opposite\u0014\nG. K. Chesterton is seldom what we expect but often what we need.\u0014\nA conversation with Philip Yancey\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Yancey credits G.K. Chesterton with helping to save his faith \nfrom a bitter encounter with fundamentalism. The power of \nChesterton's work also pointed Yancey toward a writing career that \nhas produced such enriching books as Soul Survivor, The Jesus I Never \nKnew, What's So Amazing About Grace? and Where Is God When It Hurts? \nWe talked to Yancey about what contemporary Christiansespecially \nevangelicalscan learn from the jolly journalist.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou've written that Chesterton helped you recover the joy of faith. \nHow did he do that?\u0014\n\u0014\nChesterton believed that a godly way of life is the best way of all \nways. It's the way the world is supposed to work, the way the world \nis meant to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals often say that Christianity is a \"counter-culture.\" I \nthink Chesterton would probably say, \"No, Christianity is the \nculture. Heretics are the counter-culture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we need to do is rediscover the culture. And the culture \nincludes joy and pleasure.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo often, the church is viewed as this finger-wagging, don't-have-fun \ninstitution. Those of us who are in it know that that's a caricature, \nbut that is the impression a lot of people have. Chesterton would say \nexactly the opposite. He would say: \"To have fun, live the way God \nintended life to be livedthe Christian way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was very helpful to me, because I came from a \nfire-and-brimstone, guilt-saturated fundamentalist past. I had never \nreally encountered that positive view of the world. I thought we were \nsupposed to go through life afraid, with our heads down, fleeing \nanything that smacked of pleasure. And here was a person saying \nexactly the opposite. So that was an important step in my spiritual \njourney.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs Chesterton's positive view of culture related to his Catholicism?\u0014\nOne of Chesterton's major contributions to me is his sacramental view \nof life. I'm not talking about baptism and the Eucharist and those \nthings, but about the layers of meaning that are built into the \nworld. In this view, sex and marriage, for example, are not just \nphysical actsthey are also spiritual acts and, in a sense, \ntheological acts. That's scriptural, and I think the Catholic church \nhas done a much better job of exploring the sacramental meaning of \nordinary acts than, say, Protestant evangelicals have.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn what other ways does Chesterton's upbeat attitude toward life play \nout?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was writing The Jesus I Never Knew, one of the things that \nstruck me about Jesus was that the people we would most expect to be \nrepelled by himprostitutes, tax collectors, the poor, outcast \nleperswere actually very attracted to him. I'm sure none of them \nthought, If I go to Jesus, he'll approve of my behavior. Jesus had \nvery high moral standards; no one would question those. But somehow, \nhe was able to convey a respect for them, a compassion, and a love, \neven though he disagreed with choices they made.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think Chesterton conveys much the same spirit. He carried on public \ndebates and even wrote a book called Heretics, but he always truly \nengaged people who disagreed with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor most of us, \"heretics\" conjures up the Inquisition and these \nscowling Inquisitors turning the screws of the rack. Well, Chesterton \nwas the exact opposite of that. His theology was just as strong as \ntheirs, and he believed it just as fervently, but his attitude toward \npeople he disagreed with was one of compassion and respect and good \nhumor. If we as a church could just master that skill, we'd go a long \nway toward rehabilitating what is often viewed as the soiled \nreputation of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nChesterton's humor seems to be especially lacking in much Christian \nwriting today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe folks at the old Wittenburg Door could tell you all sorts of war \nstories about how evangelicals completely misunderstand satire and \nother attempts at humor. I've experienced this, too. I answer letters \nprobably every week from people who are very uptight over something I \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, I recently responded to a woman who was upset about a \nquote I used from Frederick Buechner. He had visited my church, and \nthe person leading worship was a woman who happened to be grossly \noverweight. He made the comment, \"How can anyone let herself get that \nfat?\" Many of us in the audience were wondering the same thing. I \nreproduced that comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, I got this stinging, four-page letter about how obesity is a \ndisease, and what am I going to do next, line up people with AIDS and \nmake fun of them? I tried to answer her sensitively and \ncompassionately, but I felt like just saying, \"Lighten up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChesterton would be a good example there, because he was grossly \noverweight, over 300 pounds sometimes, and he joked about it as much \nas anybody. He just had that disarming approach of levity towards the \nworld. He didn't take things too seriously. And I think we \nevangelicals do.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're not particularly good at humor. We're susceptible to our own \nform of political correctnessit's different from what you'll find in \nacademia, but it's there.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople joke about my gray \"Afro\" hairstyle. This is just a fact of my \nlife, so I laugh with them. I think Chesterton's approach, making \nhimself the main butt of his jokes, is a good model for all of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven with all of his humor, can't Chesterton be tough to read?\u0014\n\u0014\nI would recommend drinking very strong coffee before reading \nChesterton. He is not bedtime reading, at least for me, because his \nsentences are so compact and compressed, and he leaps from thought to \nthought.\u0014\n\u0014\nChesterton was a chaotic person, and he had a chaotic style. He \nthrows ideas and phrases up in the air, but they become seeds. The \nseeds fall to the ground and take root, because they sound true. They \nreflect reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere have been people to whom I have strongly recommended the book \nOrthodoxy who come back and say, \"I wasn't able to get into it at \nall.\" It takes some work, but it's definitely worth it. I would say \nOrthodoxy had as much influence on my spiritual direction as any \nsingle book, and it's one of the few books that I go back and reread. \nIt was a revolutionary book for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today\u0014",

You see, when an \nunsaved child sits around the tree on Christmas morning - the same \ntree the baby Jesus played in front of when Mary and Joseph \ncelebrated Christmas -- opening gifts - with each peel of the wrapper \nthat little child is taking a whip to the Lord's back. And it pains \nHim so! And the Lord doesn't just get angry, my friends! - He gets \neven!  \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause unsaved children don't deserve any gifts, much less gifts \nthat celebrate a Savior their parents have denounced! It's like the \nlittle tykes are going to a birthday party they weren't invited to \nand stealing all of the birthday boy's presents! Now, some of you \nyellow-bellied New Age Christians who don't go to Landover and are \nlistening to me on your fancy satellite might be thinking, \"Oh, but \nJesus loves the little children.\" Well, I have news for you: just \nbecause a silly little song says something, don't make it so! Jesus \nhates children who don't flatter Him and give Him His due. In fact, \nthe Lord gets so jealous when people don't pay enough attention to \nHim that He even punishes little children for things their daddies \nmight have done! (Exodus 20:5) \u0014\n\u0014\nSo my friends, if a 4-year-old's parents are unsaved, it is just like \nthat little child himself spit in Jesus' eye. It don't make a lick of \ndifference to the Lord. You doubt me? Did the Lord go around asking \nlittle babies if they wanted to \"opt out\" of the Great Flood? No sir! \nHe just went right ahead and drown them little kids! God knows that \nsin is in the blood, and the only way to get rid of it, it to snuff \nout entire bloodlines. He taught us that with the Great Flood, and \npeople still snub their noses and refuse to learn that lesson! \u0014\n\u0014\nAs True Christians, we know from the Holy Bible that unsaved folks \nwho celebrate Christmas are committing an unforgivable sin. That's \nthe sin of Blasphemy of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 12:31). Jesus teaches \nus that people who celebrate His birthday without getting His \npermission, are doomed to spend eternity in Hell. Even if someone who \nis rude enough crash Jesus' birthday party chooses to accept Him as \ntheir personal Savior later in life, they still don't get to go to \nHeaven. They are condemned to Hell and Jesus tells us that there is \nnothing He, nor His Daddy, nor anyone else can ever do about it. \nThat's a whole lot of folks on fire, ain't it? You'd better believe \nthat Hell is gonna be 1,000 times the size of Heaven. Friends, God is \nstill working on Hell. He's got lots of people to roast, and they are \nwaiting in line! Jesus promises us that He is going to pitch unsaved \npeople into a \"furnace of fire.\" (Matthew 13:41-42). You think the \nNazis were the first ones to think of burning folks with furnaces? \nNo, my friend - the Lord is always one step ahead of the feeble \nefforts of mankind. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt might not make sense when we hear that God is going to interrupt \nlittle unsaved children from unwrapping gifts under the Christmas \ntree and hurl them into a pit of fire, but it's not for us to \nquestion how the Lord gets his kicks. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince we know what God has in store for strangers who go around \ncelebrating His birthday, it might be a good idea to show some \nChristian charity and do something to help them out before their fate \nis sealed. We already have True Christians who are lobbying Congress \nto put laws into effect that will prevent non-Christians from \ndestroying their lives by celebrating Christmas. With new \ncomputer-credit-card domestic activity surveillance techniques put in \nplace by our Bush administration, it has become a whole lot easier to \ntrack the purchase of gifts by nonbelievers. They should put these \nsorts of people in Jail, or fine them. Anything to deter them from \nmaking a mockery of God. It's for their own good! \u0014\n\u0014\nI'd like to end here, by calling on our Christian children in this \ncongregation, who hold this holiday so dear, to stand up and do \nsomething wonderful for Jesus! I will offer as a Christmas reward \npresent, this brand new 12-guage Remington Shotgun, to the Junior \nHigh youth who reports to the Landover Baptist Police Department, the \nnames and addresses of the most unsaved school chums they hear \ntalking about getting Christmas presents, but have not accepted Jesus \nChrist as their personal playmate. I'm going to keep this shotgun \nright here, on the edge of the baptismal pool until next week, when \nwe get the final tally from Deacon Chief O'Neil. The gun will then be \ngiven to the mother of the child who will wrap it, and place it with \nother gifts around the tree on Sunday Morning with a little note that \nsays, \"Merry Christmas, And Fine Shooting, From Your Best Friend, \nJesus Christ.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n----------Pastor Deacon Fred, Landover Baptist Church\u0014",

    "title": "SALVATION IN THE SLUMS",
    "words": "(by Gordon MacDonald, Leadership editor-at-large)\u0014\n\u0014\n   FROM MY JOURNAL: A friend sent me Salvation in the Slums by\u0014\n   Norris Magnuson. It's Magnuson's doctoral thesis, published in\u0014\n   1977 and reprinted by Baker in 1990. What a tremendous\u0014\n   overview of evangelical social ministry from 1865 to 1920.\u0014\n\u0014\n   I've harbored a sense of embarrassment over the seeming\u0014\n   evangelical naivety regarding how the biblical gospel\u0014\n   intersects with the real world of need and struggle. Magnuson\u0014\n   does a masterful job of pointing out that this hasn't always\u0014\n   been so. There was a time when the foremost expression of\u0014\n   one's faith was his or her unrestrained compassion for the\u0014\n   disadvantaged: the economically deprived, the immigrant, the\u0014\n   orphan, the famine-plagued, the oppressed, etc. Our heritage\u0014\n   of ministry is deep and powerful. Not only did earlier\u0014\n   generations of evangelicals spring to the needs of the poor,\u0014\n   they were in the forefront of powerful innovative thinking\u0014\n   that sparked legislation, social planning, and organized\u0014\n   efforts to change the environmental conditions that so often\u0014\n   lead to poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\n   One chapter that really impressed me: the evangelical view of\u0014\n   war. Evangelicals were much more known for peace-making then\u0014\n   than they are now. They readily counseled the American\u0014\n   government to seek arbitration and negotiation before drawing\u0014\n   the swords. And many of them made it quite clear that human\u0014\n   rights came before national interest. I like those guys.\u0014\n\u0014\n   What Magnuson doesn't ask -- and it wasn't his problem in this\u0014\n   book -- is what in the world happened to our movement after\u0014\n   1920, when the gospel turned toward a self-absorption and made\u0014\n   social concern much more a personal option?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Magnuson quotes A.B. Simpson in 1899: \"The law of Christ is\u0014\n   the bearing of others' burdens, the sharing of others' griefs,\u0014\n   sacrificing yourself for another.... This (is) the law of\u0014\n   Christianity ... (and) of the saint. It is the only way to be\u0014\n   saved. From the beginning it has always been so. A good way\u0014\n   to test your love to God is by the way you treat your brother\u0014\n   ... God is more concerned by my conduct toward my brother than\u0014\n   by my prayers to him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   I find it interesting that Simpson, a leading evangelical, was\u0014\n   saying those kinds of things in 1899 -- and getting a hearing.\u0014\n   Would he be hounded out of some circles of fellowship today if\u0014\n   he said those same things? Just wondering.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Salvation in the Slums isn't easy reading. (Is any doctoral\u0014\n   thesis?) But it's necessary reading for anyone who thinks, as\u0014\n   I do, that we need a fresh understanding of the gospel and its\u0014\n   implications in the 21st century.\u0014",

    "words": "The Trail of Tears occurred in 1835, when the Cherokee were rounded \nup by the U.S. Army, interned in open stockades like cattle, then \ndriven 1200 miles from our ancestral home in the southeast to what is \nnow northeastern Oklahoma. The removal occurred in the middle of \nwinter without proper food or supplies. An incredible one-fourth of \nour entire nation died along the Trail, including several of my \nancestors. Nevertheless, there were other American-Indian encounters \nfar bloodier and which rank more malevolent and outright evil than \nthe Trail of Tears. If the level of malevolence was higher in other \nevents, for sheer numbers the Trail of Tears is hard to match.\u0014\n------------------------------\u0014\nSpitting at Andrew Jackson\u0014\n\u0014\nIf I had known Jackson would drive us from our homes, I would have \nkilled him at the Horseshoe. 3\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least twice a week I conducted legal business in the Jackson \nCounty Courthouse, in Kansas City, Missouri. Jackson County is named \nfor Andrew Jackson and a bronze memorial statue of him astride a \nproud steed lies before the courthouse steps so that I crossed its \npath when I entered the courthouse.\u0014\nSurrounded by attractively arranged flowers in the spring and summer, \nJackson's monument is a point of beauty and civic pride for those \nconducting legal business in the courthouse. Yet, each time I passed \nby Jackson's monument, I spat upon it with contempt. It was a small \ngesture, but one filled with personal meaning.\u0014\nAndrew Jackson is the Hitler of my people. What makes him doubly \nhated by the Cherokee is that our people helped him win the battle \nagainst the Creeks that raised him to national prominence. He was \nquick to forget us; for our pains, he rewarded us with the Trail of \nTears. 4\u0014\nFrom the earliest time I can remember, my grandmother and mother told \nme of the Trail of Tears. The story is not a fairy tale, with a happy \nending. It was not told to comfort me or to teach me a moral truth. I \nwas told so that I would not forget. I was told because it is my \nhistory, the history of my family, a story of treachery and survival.\u0014\nI do not know when the memory first started; it always was. My memory \nis something I have never spoken about or shared with others, even my \nfamily. Some might believe it is the result of an overactive \nimagination. Some might believe I internalized the story from the \nmany times I heard it. I know it is a gift. From whom I do not know. \nThe memory simply is and always will be.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee: Word\\My Documents\\Forgivenss Paper\u0014",

    "words": "Stone Tablet Confirms Solomon's Temple, Biblical Narrative\u0014\nPlus: Ashcroft goes to bat for faith-based initiative, and other \nstories from online sources around the world.\u0014\nTed Olsen | posted 01/14/2003, Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Solomon's Temple Tablet may be the most significant archaeological \nfinding yet\" in Israel\u0014\nA sandstone tablet with an inscription very similar to 2 Kings 12 may \nbe extremely significant both in biblical archaeology and Israeli \nreligious politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ten lines of Phoenician script describes King Jehoash's orders \n\"to buy quarry stones and timber and copper and labour to carry out \nthe duty with the faith\" in repairing the First Temple. \u0014\nIf it's authentic, \"it would be a first-of-its kind piece of physical \nevidence describing events in a manner that adheres to the narrative \nin the Bible,\" says the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'aretz, which broke the \nstory yesterday. It can also increase tension between Jerusalem's \nJews and Muslims. \"Muslim clerics insist, despite overwhelming \narchaeological evidence, that no Jewish shrine ever stood at [the \nTemple Mount],\" the Associated Press explains. \"That claim was made \nby Palestinian officials in failed negotiations with Israel in 2000 \nover who would be sovereign there.\" There are two mosques currently \non the site.\u0014\n\u0014\nGold flecks burned into the tablet suggest it might actually have \nbeen part of Solomon's Temple, says Amos Bean, director of the \nGeological Survey of Israel. \"These specks of gold are not natural \nmaterial, but a sign of human activity,\" he told the AP. \"They could \nbe from gold-plated objects in the home of a very rich man, or a \ntemple.It's hard to believe that anyone would know how to do these \nthings to make it look real.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Geological Survey of Israel is standing firmly beside the \nartifact. \"Our findings show that it is authentic,\" says Shimon \nIlani, whose geological tests confirm that the writing dates to the \n9th century B.C.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the GSI was the second organization to examine the tablet. The \nJerusalem collector who owns the tablet first went to the Israel \nMuseum, but curators there couldn't rule whether it was a forgery. \nMuseum officials have so far avoided press comment on this finding.\u0014\n\u0014\nGabriel Barkai, an Israeli archaeologist from Bar Ilan University's \nLand of Israel Studies Department, told Ha'aretz that it's too early \nto pass judgment. \"The problem here is that circumstances of the \nfinding are not clear,\" he said. \"We should wait for the official \nscientific publication, at which time we will be able to probe this \nfinding carefully. Right now, of course, we can't rule out any \npossibility. It's too bad that a matter of this sort was kept under \nwraps, apparently due to business concerns.\" But if it turns out to \nbe what it seems, Barkai says, it could be \"the most significant \narchaeological finding yet in Jerusalem and the Land of Israel.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Sir William Blackstone (1723-1780) was a mediocre lawyer and an \nundistinguished judge, yet his name became so synonymous with the law \nthat English criminals once used it as slang for any lawyer. His fame \nrests on his writings, which provided both the first exposition of \nEnglish common law for laymen and the basis for both the Declaration \nof Independence and the Constitution of the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nElegant, lucid, and refreshingly simple, Blackstone's lectures, \ndelivered at Oxford University, were intended \"to lay down a general \nand comprehensive Plan of the Laws of England.\" They represented the \nfirst real attempt anyone had made to explain English law to the \nnon-lawyer (and the first lectures on English law offered at a \nuniversity). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lectures were published in an expanded form as Commentaries on \nthe Laws of England, and were a tremendous success. The four-volume \nwork sold so well that it earned Blackstone 14,000 pounds during his \nlifetime, a considerable sum in 18th-century England. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, success also brought enemies. Blackstone became the \ntarget of vitriolic attacks by such distinguished philosophers and \nscholars as Jeremy Bentham and Joseph Priestly, who objected to his \nconservatism and his seemingly uncritical view of the monarchy. \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven Blackstone's political views, it is all the more surprising \nthat his work became one of the cornerstones of American \nconstitutionalism. Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and the other \nFounding Fathers found in Blackstone's words the blueprint for \nAmerican government, including the idea of separation of powers, the \nnotion of \"inalienable rights\" given by God, and even the prohibition \nagainst taxation without representation. Abraham Lincoln was also an \navid reader of Blackstone, sharing the Englishman's distaste for \nslavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis American readers did not adopt all of Blackstone's ideas, though. \nBlackstone believed that \"the king is not only incapable of doing \nwrong, but even of thinking wrong.\" \u0014\nHBClub\u0014",

Chesterton, Orthodoxy\u0014\n\u0014\nThe monstrosity of sexual intercourse outside marriage is that those \nwho indulge in it are trying to isolate one kind of union (the \nsexual) from all the other kinds of union which were intended to go \nalong with it and make up the total union. The Christian attitude \ndoes not mean that there is anything wrong about sexual pleasure, any \nmore than about the pleasure of eating. It means that you must not \nisolate that pleasure and try to get it by itself, any more than you \nought to try to get the pleasures of taste without swallowing and \ndigesting, by chewing things and spitting them out again.\u0014\nC.

He has yet to cross \nanything off. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     With Colin Powell's address to the United \nNations ratcheting up\u0014\n                     pressure on Saddam Hussein and a military \nconflict drawing ever closer,              \u0014\n                     there is remarkable consensus among war planners \nabout one\u0014\n                     thing--that the United States would win a second \nGulf War, and\u0014\n                     in short order. \"On the military side, the \noutcome is not in\u0014\n                     doubt,\" says one top officer. Iraq's ramshackle \nand ill-trained Army, they argue, \u0014\n                     would be little match against overwhelming U.S. \nmilitary\u0014\n                     superiority. With 125,000 troops already in the \nregion and the northern half of\u0014\n                     Kuwait converted into a vast marshaling yard, \nthe Pentagon last week launched\u0014\n                     another round of deployments, sending the 101st \nAirborne Division and the aircraft\u0014\n                     carrier Kitty Hawk toward the Persian Gulf. More \nthan 42,000 British troops are\u0014\n                     poised for an attack, and cargo ships continue \nto bring a stream of tanks and\u0014\n                     armored vehicles into Kuwaiti ports. Retired \nGen. Barry McCaffrey, whose 24th\u0014\n                     Mechanized Infantry Division helped execute the \nfamous \"left hook\" attack against\u0014\n                     an Iraqi Army stronger than today's in Operation \nDesert Storm, puts it this way:\u0014\n                     \"The Iraqis have no good military options. There \nis no technique, no tool that they\u0014\n                     can now adopt that will have any military \nsignificance on the outcome of the\u0014\n                     conflict.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Yet beneath the confidence among U.S. officials \nabout the outcome, a general\u0014\n                     unease exists about the unintended consequences \nof trying to take down Saddam\u0014\n                     Hussein's regime. It could go smoothly: Michael \nO'Hanlon of the Brookings\u0014\n                     Institution estimates that as few as 100 U.S. \nsoldiers may be killed. If things go\u0014\n                     badly, he predicts, that figure could hit 5,000. \nSaddam, many fear, like the biblical\u0014\n                     Samson, will bring the walls of the temple down \naround himself. \"Based on a fair\u0014\n                     amount of trying to figure Saddam and his \ncronies out, I wouldn't try to predict how\u0014\n                     they will behave,\" remarks one senior Pentagon \nplanner. \"That's what makes them\u0014\n                     so dangerous.\" The following are scenarios that \nwar planners tell U.S. News keep\u0014\n                     them up at night. Some of their worst-case \nscenarios they refuse to divulge, for fear\u0014\n                     of giving Saddam any more ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     1. Iraqi forces unleash their chemical or \nbiological weapons arsenal. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     After the 1991 Gulf War, the CIA reported that \nSaddam Hussein had ordered his\u0014\n                     troops to use chemical weapons if American \ntroops crossed a certain line in Iraq.\u0014\n                     They didn't, and a fusillade of deadly gases was \nnever launched. This time around,\u0014\n                     any war would go all the way to Baghdad, and \nU.S. intelligence is reporting that\u0014\n                     Saddam recently authorized his field commanders \nto use chemical weapons to\u0014\n                     combat a U.S. invasion. Most likely, Saddam \nwould use artillery-delivered mustard\u0014\n                     gas and nerve agents against U.S. ground \nelements advancing on Baghdad. If so,\u0014\n                     says McCaffrey, \"it's going to create conditions \nof abject misery, but it will have no\u0014\n                     impact on the pace of the operation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     U.S. military planners are working to confound \nIraq's ability to use these weapons.\u0014\n                     The invasion plan is designed to move swiftly, \nsow confusion, and cut off Saddam's\u0014\n                     command and control. Already, U.S. forces are \nconducting psychological \u0014\n                     operations to persuade local commanders to \nignore orders to use weapons of \u0014\n                     mass destruction or face war-crimes charges in \nthe aftermath. But the orders \ncould                                     still be carried out by the \nSpecial Security Organization, a powerful agency headed  \u0014\n                     by one of Saddam's sons.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Iraq is most experienced at loading chemical \nweapons into artillery shells that \u0014\n                     could be used on the battlefield. Unprotected \nIraqi civilians could be killed, and \u0014\n                     U.S. forces might still take casualties despite \ntheir protective gear, but U.S. forces \u0014\n                     could take out artillery batteries relatively \nquickly. Biological weapons could be \u0014\n                     scarier still, particularly if Saddam employed a \nnonconventional delivery system, \u0014\n                     such as aerosol sprayers hidden along major \nroads. \"We might not even realize \u0014\n                     we've been slimed,\"\u0014\n                     says Michael Eisenstadt, a military expert at \nthe Washington Institute for Near   \u0014\n                     East Policy. Defenses against exotic agents like \nbotulinum toxins are limited. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     According to Powell, Iraq retains several dozen \nlong-range Scud missiles it could\u0014\n                     use to hit nearby U.S. military command posts or \nagainst Israel in order to draw a\u0014\n                     response that could provoke the Arab world. But \nU.S. Scud-hunting techniques\u0014\n                     have improved since the last war, and special \noperations troops may already be\u0014\n                     scouring the western Iraqi desert to neutralize \nany remaining launchers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     In his presentation to the United Nations last \nweek, Powell revealed a newer, more\u0014\n                     serious threat: Iraq has been testing unmanned \naerial vehicles with a range of more\u0014\n                     than 300 miles. Combined with spraying \ntechnology that Iraq has previously\u0014\n                     developed, these could deliver deadly biological \nagents to a number of neighboring\u0014\n                     countries and nearby U.S. military bases. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     2. Saddam Hussein makes a bloody last stand in \nBaghdad. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Baghdad is the one true prize in the fight for \nIraq, but it could prove a costly one for\u0014\n                     U.S. troops. Many analysts think most Iraqis \nwould simply hunker down in their\u0014\n                     homes and wait out the war. But the streets of \nthe capital could provide a last-ditch\u0014\n                     defense for Saddam's most loyal troops: the \nSpecial Republican Guard and his\u0014\n                     fiercely disciplined security forces. \"If you \nhave 100,000 people willing to defend\u0014\n                     Saddam, that can cause a lot of casualties,\" \nsays Kenneth Pollack, an Iraq \u0014\n                     analyst at the CIA during the Gulf War. Troops \nand tanks that make easy targets \u0014\n                     in the open desert are harder to attack in an \nurban setting, and war planners worry \u0014\n                     that civilian casualties and so-called \ncollateral damage could weaken support for \u0014\n                     the U.S. war effort. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The Army's 1993 experience in Mogadishu, \nSomalia, where 18 Rangers were \nkilled                                     by\u0014\n                     Somali militiamen, is still fresh in the minds \nof officials at the Pentagon. In recent\u0014\n                     months, U.S. soldiers and marines have been \nassaulting mock cities in Louisiana,\u0014\n                     California, and Guam to prepare for what they \nmight encounter in Baghdad. Marine\u0014\n                     Corps officials have also traveled to Israel to \nstudy how the Israeli Defense Forces\u0014\n                     quelled the Palestinian uprising in the West \nBank town of Jenin. Yet \nmilitary                                                    officials\u0014\n                     are still hopeful that after a massive \nbombardment of Saddam's power centers and\u0014\n                     wholesale defections of Iraqi troops, they might \nnever have to apply what they've\u0014\n                     learned. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     3. Iraq's oil wells are turned into fields of \nfire. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     As they retreated from Kuwait in 1991, Iraqi \ntroops committed one final indiginity:\u0014\n                     They torched the country's oil wells. It took \noil-field workers nine months to put the\u0014\n                     fires out, and Central Command is expecting \nSadadam would use the same \ntactic                                       if the U.S. invades. \nAccording to intelligence officials, there are signs that Saddam   \u0014\n                     has already wired some of Iraq's 1,500 oil wells \nto explode on his orders. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     This time, war planners would try to dispatch \nU.S. or coalition forces to protect the\u0014\n                     oil fields before he could set them ablaze. But \nif he did, the result could be far \u0014\n                     worse than in 1991. Besides the fact that Iraq \nhas more than twice as many wells \u0014\n                     as Kuwait, oil-field firefighters say the \nnatural pressure in Iraq's oil wells may be \u0014\n                     double that of the Kuwaiti wells, meaning that \nfires would be more intense. In \u0014\n                     addition to polluting the air, the wells could \nfoul the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, \u0014\n                     sources of water for drinking and irrigation, as \nwell as dump 2 million to 3 million \u0014\n                     barrels of oil a day into the Persian Gulf. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Jeff Miller of Cudd Pressure Control, one of the \noil-field firefighting companies the\u0014\n                     Pentagon has retained to cap burning wells, says \nthat while firefighters were able \u0014\n                     to extinguish the 1991 fires at the rate of one \nblaze per day, it would take much \u0014\n                     longer in Iraq. \"This looks like six to seven \ndays per well in some locations, and       \u0014\n                    multiply that by the number of wells, and you've \ngot a huge environmental disaster.\" \u0014\n                    According to Miller, the Defense Department has \ncontingency plans in place for his 38\u0014\n                    employees as well as dozens of other firefighters \nfrom three other companies. \"They all\u0014\n                    have pagers, kind of like doctors,\" he says. If \ncalled, it would probably take them 24 to 48\u0014\n                    hours to arrive, probably on military and \ncivilian cargo planes that also carry their equipment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     4. Saddam puts civilians in harm's way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     As Air Force planners methodically pore over \ntarget lists, there is one wild card they\u0014\n                     can't control: a decision by Saddam to use human \nshields in Baghdad or other Iraqi\u0014\n                     cities. The opening phase of the war would be a \nmassive air campaign on Baghdad\u0014\n                     to cut off Saddam's command and control. \nMilitary officials worry that Saddam could\u0014\n                     put Iraqi civilians or western reporters inside \nhigh-value targets, which the Pentagon\u0014\n                     may have to strike regardless. \"It could be a \nvery dangerous situation,\" Joint Chiefs\u0014\n                     Chairman Gen. Richard Myers recently \nacknowledged. Central Command also fears\u0014\n                     that Saddam might kidnap U.N. weapons \ninspectors, holding them hostage before\u0014\n                     the United Nations was able to pull them out of \nthe country. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Such tactics could be part of a larger \nscorched-earth campaign Saddam would\u0014\n                     execute in his final days. The United States has \ngathered intelligence indicating that\u0014\n                     he would destroy mosques and power plants in an \nattempt to pin blame on western\u0014\n                     invaders. Saddam could even destroy the four key \ndams controlling the water\u0014\n                     supply in Iraq, flooding the southern marshlands \nand potentially killing thousands.\u0014\n                     During Operation Desert Storm, the U.S. military \nconsidered such a tactic to flood\u0014\n                     Baghdad, and now planners face the threat of \nSaddam's pulling out every stop to\u0014\n                     slow down a U.S. advance. Says Judith Yaphe of \nthe National Defense University,     \u0014\n                     \"I don't trust him to leave anything sacred.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     5. Terrorists acquire Saddam's weapons of mass \ndestruction. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Whether or not Saddam is currently allied with \nal Qaeda, a war could push them\u0014\n                     closer. Indeed, the CIA has assessed that Saddam \nmay well deliver chemical or\u0014\n                     biological weapons to terrorists as his \"last \nchance to exact vengeance by taking a\u0014\n                     large number of victims with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Even if this didn't happen, the chemical and \nbiological weapons stocks could still\u0014\n                     slip out of the country in the chaos following \nan invasion. \"You can take one of the\u0014\n                     mobile biological labs and drive it across the \nborder,\" says Pollack. \"The greater\u0014\n                     possibility is they get across into the open \narms of Syrian and Iranian border\u0014\n                     guards.\" These regimes already have their own \nprograms to build weapons of mass\u0014\n                     destruction (WMD). But terrorists could well \nobtain smaller quantities of harmful\u0014\n                     agents, especially if, as U.S. officials allege, \nthe stocks have been secreted all  over\u0014\n                     the country. \"There's nothing to say that an \nIraqi bioscientist doesn't have a pile of\u0014\n                     the stuff in his freezer,\" says one former \ndefense official. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     For the U.S. military, anything connected to WMD \nis a top-priority target. Air Force\u0014\n                     planners have spent months trying to locate \nthese stockpiles and determine whether\u0014\n                     or not they are safe to bomb. U.S. ground forces \nwould blanket the country as\u0014\n                     quickly as possible, using defectors and \nscientists to locate the stockpiles. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Even short of a WMD attack, the risk of \nterrorism would be much higher if there is\u0014\n                     war. Iraq, for one, would try to hit U.S. \ntargets. \"They're putting terror teams out\u0014\n                     there,\" says one source with access to \nintelligence. More broadly, al Qaeda and\u0014\n                     other groups could use the war as further \nmotivation to go after Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     6. Once Saddam is ousted, Iraq descends into \nchaos. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     After war, Iraq could prove hard to control. The \nfate of Saddam himself is perhaps\u0014\n                     least worrisome because, even if he somehow \nescaped, few experts believe he    \u0014\n                     could\u0014\n                     ever mount much of a guerrilla campaign. \"If he \nis able to thumb his nose at us like\u0014\n                     Osama bin Laden, the United States is going to \nlook ridiculous,\" says Edward\u0014\n                     Walker, a former assistant secretary of state \nfor Near Eastern affairs. \"But he won't\u0014\n                     be a threat once he's out of power, so it's more \nsymbolic.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     But Iraqis, freed from Saddam's repressive grip, \ncould unleash a wave of revenge\u0014\n                     killings that could spin out of control. \"After \na period of bloodletting, there will have\u0014\n                     to be law and order,\" says one U.S. official. \nThis would most likely take thousands\u0014\n                     of U.S. soldiers camping out in Iraq for many \nmonths. While most Iraqis probably\u0014\n                     would be happy to be rid of Saddam, there is \ngreat resentment after years of\u0014\n                     American-led sanctions. If the Iraqi death toll \nin a war is high, U.S. forces could be\u0014\n                     greeted very coldly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     American planners have devised a process for \nruling Iraq that begins with an\u0014\n                     American general in charge and evolves over a \nperiod of more than 18 months into\u0014\n                     an Iraqi government. But no decisions have been \nmade about who exactly would\u0014\n                     govern Iraq then. Iraq's numerous tribes, for \nexample, could end up battling one\u0014\n                     another in a power struggle. U.S. officials \nthink they can control it. \"If we're the most\u0014\n                     powerful player in the region, they will want to \nbe allied with us,\" says one planner.\u0014\n                     \"If we have to pay for it, so be it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Experts can spin out countless other scary \nscenarios. Kurdish parties could be\u0014\n                     tempted to push for independence. The country \ncould split between Shiite and\u0014\n                     Sunni Muslims. Or neighbor Iran could meddle. \n\"On some days, I get up thinking\u0014\n                     this will be relatively quick and we will be \nleft with a pretty good situation\u0014\n                     afterwards,\" says one U.S. official involved in \nthe planning. \"On other days, I wake\u0014\n                     up and think, `Holy sh - -.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     With Marianne Lavelle\u0014",

He received a 26 million severance package. \nPerhaps it's not \u0014\nWalter who's lacking intelligence. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS \u0014\n  Police in Oakland, California spent two hours attempting to subdue \na gunman \u0014\nwho had barricaded himself inside his home. After firing ten tear gas \ncanisters, \u0014\nofficers discovered that the man was standing beside them in the \npolice line, \u0014\nshouting, \"Please come out and give yourself up.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n3. WHAT WAS PLAN B? \u0014\n An Illinois man, pretending to have a gun, kidnapped a motorist and \nforced \u0014\nhim to drive to two different automated teller machines, wherein the \nkidnapper \u0014\nproceeded to  withdraw money from his own bank accounts. \u0014\n \u0014\n4. THE GETAWAY! \u0014\nA man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik Stop, and asked for all the \nmoney in \u0014\nthe cash drawer. Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up \nthe store \u0014\nclerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until police \nshowed up and \u0014\ngrabbed him. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. DID I SAY THAT? \u0014\n Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just \ncouldn't \u0014\ncontrol himself during a lineup. When Detectives asked each man in \nthe \u0014\nlineup to repeat the words: \"Give me all your money or I'll shoot,\" \nthe man shouted, \u0014\n\"That's not what I said!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n6. ARE WE COMMUNICATING? \u0014\n  A man spoke frantically into the phone, \"My wife is pregnant and \nher \u0014\ncontractions are only two minutes apart!\" \"Is this her first child?\" \nthe doctor asked. \u0014\n\"No!\" the man shouted, \"This is her husband!\" \u0014\n \u0014\n7. NOT THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED! \u0014\n \u0014\nIn Modesto, California, Steven Richard King was arrested for trying \nto hold \u0014\nup a Bank of America branch without a weapon. King used a thumb and a \nfinger to \u0014\nsimulate a gun, but unfortunately, he failed to keep his hand in his \npocket. \u0014\n \u0014\n 8. THE GRAND FINALE: \u0014\n \u0014\nLast summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an \nhour east \u0014\nof  Bakersfield, California, some folks, new to boating, were having \na problem. \u0014\nNo  matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get their brand new 22 \nft boat \u0014\ngoing. It was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how \nmuch power was applied. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter about an hour of trying to make it go, they put in to a nearby \u0014\nmarina, thinking someone there could tell them what was wrong. A \nthorough topside check \u0014\nrevealed  everything in perfect working condition. The engine ran \nfine, the out drive \u0014\nwent up and down, and the propeller was the correct size and pitch. \nSo, one of the \u0014\nmarina guys jumps into the water to check underneath. He came up \nchoking on water, \u0014\nhe  was laughing so hard. NOW REMEMBER... THIS IS TRUE ...Under the \nboat, still \u0014\nstrapped securely in place, was the trailer.\u0014",

    "title": "STALIN'S SHADOW STILL HANGS AROUND",
    "words": "Even in a New Russia, Stalin Shadows Putin\u0014\n\u0014\nBy VICTOR EROFEYEV\u0014\nMOSCOW\u0014\n\u0014\nRussia's greatest paradox could well be that Stalin, the ruthless \nSoviet God who conquered Hitler and created a superpower, will live \non in Russian folk memory as a hero  rather like the French with \ntheir far more innocent Napoleon. This is not masochism, but a \npeculiar feature of the Russian soul. As thousands of Russians \nobserved the 50th anniversary of Stalin's death this week  gathering \nin city centers and laying wreaths at his statues  many beyond our \nborders may wonder whether this nostalgia is actually a yearning for \na return to totalitarianism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's more complicated than that. As a Russian writer who has long \nwatched my country try to escape its oppressive past, I feel \nobligated to point out that this struggle is fraught with conflicted \ndesires. A genuine civil war is being fought in Russia between \nproductive people aspiring to a better life (in the Western sense of \nthe word) and others who nurse an ideology of resentment for the loss \nof Russia's superpower status, or even an affection for the days of \nStalin. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a conflict that can also be seen playing out in the presidency \nof Vladimir Putin. Independent politicians of the liberal camp whom I \nhave met regard Mr. Putin as a \"Westernizer\" (he knows German and is \nstudying English; his daughters attended school at the German Embassy \nin Moscow) and a democrat who, independently of his own will (he \nnever dreamed of becoming president), finds himself caught in the \nmire of the Russian mentality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat mentality has led many Russians to live inside themselves, \ntaking pride in their indifference to money, rejecting out of hand \nthe Westerner's orientation toward personal success. This is what \nsome call Russian spirituality. The poet Pushkin glorified Peter the \nGreat for cutting a window through into Europe. But cutting a window \nis not the same thing as becoming Western. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard for Russia to build on a past that offers little choice \nbeyond the excessive costs of czarism or Communism. I think no more \nthan 10 percent to 15 percent of Russians have any real idea of the \nmodern world. The rest are hostage to a past that allows 36 percent, \naccording to one recent poll, to say they thought Stalin did more \ngood than bad. Is it so surprising, then, that Russians have chosen \nVladimir Putin, a president who has opened the window to the West \nwith one hand and closed it with the other? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fairest summing up of Mr. Putin's recent behavior is rather like \na cardsharp stacking the deck (though in world politics it is \nregarded as tactics rather than cheating). It was remarked some time \nago that Vladimir Putin likes to tell people what they want to hear. \nHe was, after all, schooled in the K.G.B. He says one thing to the \nAmerican president and another to the Russian generals. (The \nexception to these agreeable conversations is his irreconcilable tone \non the subject of Chechnya.) Mr. Putin is a secretive individual, a \ntotal contrast with the explosive Boris Yeltsin and the sensitive \nMikhail Gorbachev. But what is actually happening under his \nadministration? \u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been a fierce struggle against Catholic influence, with the \ngovernment expelling clerics and accusing the Vatican of \nproselytizing. Mr. Putin's former K.G.B. colleagues have infiltrated \nthe upper levels of power for the imposition of \"social order.\" The \nRussian Parliament, pandering to the president's conservatism, has \nproposed a raft of prohibitive laws on homosexuality and abortion. \nMr. Putin has stifled elements of the independent news media; \ndissident writers like myself, Vladimir Sorokin and Victor Pelevin \nare labeled enemies of Russian culture. The government expels the \nUnited States Peace Corps and ends the humanitarian mission in \nChechnya of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \nAnd as though deliberately provoking international revulsion, the \npolice use brutal tactics to free hostages from a Moscow theater. \nJudging from this list, Russia is recoiling into its totalitarian \npast. \u0014\n\u0014\nVictor Erofeyev is editor of \"The Penguin Book of New Russian \nWriting,\" and author of \"Russian Beauty,\" a novel.\u0014",

And Carol learned to keep her mouth shut about \nsuch things. She didnt\u0014\n       know then that there were others like her for whom the ringing \nof a doorbell\u0014\n       resembled a series of triangles, or a dog bark seemed like a \ncircle with dots around\u0014\n       it.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Today, she knows that she is blessed or afflicted with \nsynesthesia (sin-es-thee-sia),\u0014\n       a condition that affects about 1 in 25,000 persons. \nSynesthetes tend to see sounds,\u0014\n       smell colors and taste shapes. When a synesthete hears the \nsound of a truck\u0014\n       backing up, making a beep-beep-beep sound, he or she might see \nthe beeps as a\u0014\n       series of red dots.

People with this ability seem to \nexperience the world with more\u0014\n       intensity, and they make unexpected connections between things \nthey see, touch,\u0014\n       smell, taste and hear, all of which is a real asset to people \ninvolved in creative work. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Was the prophet Isaiah a synesthete?

    "words": "\"Sport is America's newest and fastest-growing religion, far \noutdistancing whatever is in second place,\" says Charles S. Prebish,\u0014\n    associate professor of religious studies at Pennsylvania State \nUniversity. ...It is not merely \"like\" a religion, he argues, nor is \nit a\u0014\n    \"secular\" religion, as other religion scholars and sociologists \nhave postulated.\u0014\n\u0014\n    To Mr. Prebish, sport can and does provide its followers \neverything that traditional religions have provided over the \ncenturies. He writes:\u0014\n    \"For me, it is not just a parallel that is emerging between sport \nand religion, but rather a complete identity. Sport is religion for \ngrowing\u0014\n    numbers of Americans, and this is no product of simply facile \nreasoning or wishful thinking. Further, for many, sport religion has \nbecome\u0014\n    a more appropriate expression of personal religiosity than \nChristianity, Judaism, or any of the traditional religions. ...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Athletes and spectators for whom sport is religion may differ in \ntheir ideas about what the \"ultimate\" is, Mr. Prebish says, but sport \nis\u0014\n    the vehicle by which all of them find it.\u0014\n                                                      \u0014\n Citation: M.

The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she \nwould like to play a fun game to make the hobbes's go by faster. The \nwoman just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls \nover to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and \nexplains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains \n\"I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me \n$5, and visa-versa.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep.

She asks the lawyer: \"What goes up a hill with \nthree legs, and comes down with four?\" The lawyer looks at her with a \npuzzled look.

Was there some fault in \nhim that God would send the rest of the church leaders to death but \nspare him?\u0014\n\u0014\nSixtus II, Bishop of Rome (pope) in the year 258, comforted Lawrence. \nGod was keeping him back to undergo an even greater ordeal, said the \nbishop. \"Be comforted, you will follow me in three days,\" he is \nsupposed to have predicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman emperor, Valerian, had ordered the death of all Rome's \nbishops, priests and deacons. The prefect (Roman magistrate) who \ncarried out the order, however, knew that, as deacon, Lawrence had \ncharge of the church's money. \"I'll let you go free,\" he promised, \n\"if you will turn the money over to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the oldest traditions we have, Lawrence agreed to bring \nthe church's treasures to the prefect. \"But it will take me a few \ndays,\" he said. \"The church is very rich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReleased to carry out his promise, Lawrence distributed the church's \ngoods among the poor. He then gathered the city's lame, its blind, \nand its beggars. On the third day he appeared before the prefect. \n\"Come out and see the wondrous riches of God,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" raged the prefect.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawrence explained that these poor people would some day have new \nbodies and live forever in Heaven. The treasure of the Holy Spirit \nwas hidden in them as if in jars of clay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThwarted from getting his gold and believing that he would be the \nlaughing stock of Rome, the prefect ordered a slow death for \nLawrence. On this day, August 10, 258, Lawrence was tortured by \nhaving his arms dislocated and then was laid upon a grill and slowly \nroasted to death. During his ordeal, he is said to have suggested his \nkillers turn him over, remarking that he was \"done\" on the one side. \nHe was so calm that the pagans who looked on were greatly impressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is how the legends tell the story, but the facts are not easy to \nestablish. What is certain is that Lawrence was martyred on this day. \nA hundred years later his story was so well known that the famous \nBishop Ambrose of Milan wrote about him and so did others. By then, \nemperor Constantine had long since built a chapel in his memory. \nLater popes built other memorials and these became Rome's Church of \nSan Lorenzo.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nAmbrose. \"On the Duties of the Clergy,\" translated by the Rev.

    "title": "STEVE JOBS AND HIS LEGACY",
    "words": "By Suzanne Choney \u0014\n 10/5/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSteve Jobs will be remembered as a titan of business, of course. \nBut for those of us who struggled decades ago to learn lines of code \nin order to create something as elementary as a letter on a computer, \nJobs will forever be associated with making modern computing simple, \nseamless and satisfying. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe iconic co-founder of Apple, along with Steve Wozniak, helped \ncreate a funny-looking computer named the Apple I, then II, in the \n1970s that became synonymous with style and ease of use, as did \ndozens of products that would follow over the years, including the \nMacintosh, iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad. With the creation of the \niTunes Store and 99-cent song downloads in 2003, he upended the \ndigital music business at a time when it could have easily tipped in \nfavor of piracy, a direction it was headed. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy 2008, the iTunes Store was the leading source for consumers to buy \ndigital music, and it spawned other online-buying websites that tried \nto follow its simple-to-use model. It also led to Apple's creation of \nthe \\App Store in 2008 for buying programs and software for the \niPhone, and this year, the Mac itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wireless world was completely revolutionized by the release of \nthe iPhone in 2007. At that time, the word \"smartphone\" was largely \nequated with BlackBerrys, the standard bearer for the business class. \nJobs saw the iPhone as a mobile \\computing device, and not just a \nphone, for everyone  something his competitors did not grasp at that \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\n'I'll always stay connected with Apple'\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs' failing health  he was diagnosed with rare form of pancreatic \ncancer in 2004, and had a liver transplant in 2009  was obvious to \nall who saw photos of the world's most famous CEO in recent years in \nhis trademark blue jeans and black turtleneck.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite taking a leave of absence from Apple earlier this year, he \ndid make a few public appearances to unveil new products  still the \nshowman that he was known to be, with his trademark, \"And... one more \nthing\"to deliver the big reveal, whether it was a new Mac or iPhone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at each of his subsequent public appearances, he seemed a little \nmore frail and a little less energetic than the time before, the \nturtlenecks looser, the blue jeans baggier.\u0014\n\u0014\nApple fans and followers were devastated by his letter of resignation \nAug. 24, in which he wrote: \"I have always said if there ever came a \nday when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's \nCEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day \nhas come.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was an ominous sign from the man who said, in 1985, \"Ill always \nstay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life Ill sort \nof have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and \nout of each other, like a tapestry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the threads of the tapestry were fraying. Jobs asked in his \nletter of resignation to remain as chairman of Apple's board, holding \nout, as he did so defiantly about many things  products, software, \ndesign, marketing  until the end.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome had hoped Jobs would even make an appearance at Tuesday's \nunveiling of the new iPhone, nearly six weeks after his resignation. \nBut he did not. \u0014\n\u0014\nA telling speech\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after his cancer diagnosis, when Jobs was 50, he gave the \ncommencement address to the 2005 graduating class of Stanford \nUniversity. It's an oft-quoted speech because it was such a personal \none. \u0014\n\u0014\nJobs the showman was quite the opposite when it came to family \nmatters. But in the speech, he shared his thoughts about many \npersonal things, including his own life  and death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No one wants to die,\" he said. \"Even people who want to go to heaven \ndon't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we \nall share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, \nbecause Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is \nLife's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. \nRight now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will \ngradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so \ndramatic, but it is quite true.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was typical Jobs: Dramatic and yet no-nonsense all in the same \nbreath. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This stuff doesnt change the world. It really doesnt,\" he said \nabout technology in a Wired magazine interview, eight years before he \nwas diagnosed with cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Im sorry, its true. Having children really changes your view on \nthese things. Were born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. \nIts been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it \nmuch  if at all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jobs changed technology and how the everyday person used it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"His impact on the world of technology and American business can not \nbe underestimated,\" said Tim Bajarin, a technology consultant who \nattended the Apple shareholders meeting in January 1984, where the \nfirst Macintosh was unveiled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"His simple vision of creating products that he would want  ones \nthat were elegant and easy to use, is what drove him and Apple to \nspectacular success.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SURVEY: FREQUENT BIBLE READING CAN TURN YOU LIBERAL",
    "words": "Survey: Frequent \nBible Reading Can Turn You Liberal \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat a surprising survey says about how reading the Bible frequently \ncan turn you liberal (in some ways). \u0014\n\u0014\nAaron B. Franzen | posted 10/12/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nA recent poll from LifeWay Research found that 89 percent of American \nhouseholds still own a Bible, with the average home having 4.1 \nBibles. But owning a Bible is different from reading itand pollsters \nmight be surprised by what happens when many Americans do.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost polls, surveys, and studies that have examined the Bible's \ninfluence have looked at views of its inspiration and methods of \ninterpretation. Gallup, for example, has for four decades asked \nAmericans how literally the Bible should be taken. Comparatively very \nlittle research has looked into what happens when one actually reads \nthe Bible, especially when one reads it independently outside the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we've assumed that such questions would be redundant, merely \none more measure of religiosity, along with how often one attends \nchurch, how literally one views the Bible, and how much one prays. \nWhen researchers look at these indicators, they usually find a \ncorrelation with both political and moral conservativism. It's not \nalways the case, but it is a trend. Reading the Bible on one's own \nmakes a difference, too. The interesting part, however, is the \nunexpected difference it makes.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrequent Bible reading has some predictable effects on the reader. It \nincreases opposition to abortion as well as homosexual marriage and \nunions. It boosts a belief that science helps reveal God's glory. It \ndiminishes hopes that science will eventually solve humanity's \nproblems. But unlike some other religious practices, reading the \nBible more often has some liberalizing effectsor at least makes the \nreader more prone to agree with liberals on certain issues. This is \ntrue even when accounting for factors such as political beliefs, \neducation level, income level, gender, race, and religious measures \n(like which religious tradition one affiliates with, and one's views \nof biblical literalism).\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrorism, Justice, and Science\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2007, the Baylor Religion Survey asked Americans how often they \nread the Bible on their own. (It was a five-point scale in this \nstudy, ranging from \"never\" to \"several times a week.\") It also asked \nwhether the federal government should expand its authority to fight \nterrorisma reference to the Patriot Act. For each increased level of \nBible-reading frequency, support for the Patriot Act decreased by \nabout 13 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrequent Bible reading also influences views on criminal justice. As \nmight be expected, respondents who were more politically liberal were \nprone to disagree with the statement, \"The government should punish \ncriminals more harshly.\" Unexpectedly (at least given the \nconservative stereotype), the more frequently people read the Bible, \nthe more they too are prone to disagree with the statement. This is \nnot an anomalous finding: Support for abolishing the death penalty \nincreased by about 45 percent for each increase on the five-point \nscale measuring Bible-reading frequency.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading the Bible affects attitudes toward science as well. If you \njust ask people about biblical literalism, you don't find \nstatistically significant differences in views of whether science and \nreligion are compatible. But the more someone reads the Bible, the \nmore likely he or she is to believe science and religion are \ncompatible. (For each increase on the five-point scale, the odds that \nthey see religion and science as incompatible decrease by 22 percent.)\u0014\n\u0014\nJustice and Consumption\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the most interesting findings relate to moral attitudes. \"How \nimportant is it,\" the survey asked, \"to actively seek social and \neconomic justice in order to be a good person?\" Again, as would be \nexpected, those with more liberal political leanings were more likely \nto say it's very or somewhat important. And those who read the Bible \nmore often were more likely to agree. Indeed, they were almost 35 \npercent more likely to agree at each point on Baylor's five-point \nscale. That may be bad news for Glenn Beck, who last year told \nbelievers to leave their churches if they hear \"social justice\" \nlanguage being used. Likewise, contrary to liberal media stereotypes, \nthose who are most engaged in their faith (by directly and frequently \nreading its source material) are those who are most supportive of \nsocial and economic justice. A reading, politically conservative \nliteralist is only slightly less supportive than a non-reading, \npolitically liberal non-literalist.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, the survey asked whether one must consume or use fewer \ngoods in order to be a good person. Political liberals and frequent \nBible readers are more likely to say yes. A conservative Bible reader \nmight not be as prone to say yes as a liberal non-reader, but think \nof it this way: Ask an evangelical who is politically conservative, \nhas some college education, has an average level of income, is a \nbiblical literalist, and does not read the Bible, and you'll have \nonly a 22 percent chance he or she will say reducing consumption is \npart of ethical living. Ask the same person, only now they read the \nBible, and you'll have a 44 percent chance they'll say so. It's still \nnot a majority, but the swing is dramatic.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy The Bible Pushes You Leftward\u0014\n\u0014\nThe discussion becomes even more interesting when we consider who is \nmost likely to read the Bible frequently. It's evangelicals and \nbiblical literalists, those who tend to be more conservative on these \ntopics. In other words, those who read the Bible most often are more \nconservative, but the more they read the Bible, the more likely it is \nthat their views will change, at least on these topics.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does this happen? One possible explanation is that readers tend \nto have expectations of a text prior to reading it. Given the Bible's \nprominence in our society, it's little wonder that many people think \nthey know what's in it before they open it up. But once they start \nreading it on their own, they are bound to be surprised by something, \nand this surprising new content is then integrated and grafted on to \nthe familiar. Beliefs do change with the addition of new information.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it doesn't have to be unfamiliar content to surprise the reader. \nIt just has to be personally relevant. Frequent Bible readers may \nhave different views of biblical authority, but they tend to read it \ndevotionally, looking for ways in which Scripture is speaking \ndirectly to them. They will read until struck by something that \nsticks out in the text. Even if the reader thinks the Bible has some \nerror or needs a lot of interpretation, this thunderbolt moment can \ntake on tremendous personal significance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut frequent Bible readers don't just see the Bible as personal. They \nalso see it as authoritative, written by an author who had a specific \ncontext and intent, and they want to conform to its message. After \nall, why read the Bible with no desire to embrace what it teaches?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, sometimes reading the Bible can change views and attitudes \nbecause readers are surprised by what's in it. Other times, it's just \na matter of discipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nAaron B. Franzen is a graduate student in the sociology department at \nBaylor University. \u0014\nCopyright  2011 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Steve Jobs, whose death was announced Wednesday night, Oct. 5, 2011, \nwasn't a computer scientist. He had no training as a hardware \nengineer or industrial designer. The businesses Apple entered under \nhis leadership  from personal computers to MP3 players to smart \nphones  all existed before the company got there.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut with astonishing regularity, Jobs did something that few people \naccomplish even once: he reinvented entire industries. He did it with \nones that were new, like PCs, and he did it with ones that were old, \nlike music. And his pace only accelerated over the years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was the most celebrated, successful business executive of his \ngeneration, yet he flouted many basic tenets of business wisdom. \n(Like his hero and soul mate, Polaroid founder Edwin Land, he refused \nto conduct focus groups or other research that might tell him what \nhis customers wanted.) In his many public appearances as the head of \na large public corporation, he rarely sounded like one. He introduced \nthe first Macintosh by quoting Bob Dylan, and he took to saying that \nApple sat \"at the intersection of the liberal arts and technology.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs' confidence in the wisdom of his instincts came to be immense, \nas did the hype he created at Apple product launches. That might have \nbeen unbearable if it weren't the case that his intuition was nearly \nflawless and the products often lived up to his lofty claims. St. \nLouis Cardinals pitching great \"Dizzy\" Dean could have been talking \nabout Jobs rather than himself when he said, \"It ain't bragging if \nyou can back it up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs' eventual triumph was so absolute  in 2011, Apple's market \ncapitalization passed that of Exxon Mobil, making it the planet's \nmost valuable company  that it's easy to forget how checkered his \nreputation once was. Over the first quarter-century of his career, he \nwas associated with as many failed products as hits. Having been \nforced out of Apple in 1985, he was associated with failure, period. \nEven some of his admirers thought of him as the dreamer who'd lost \nthe war for personal-computer dominance to Microsoft's indomitable \nBill Gates.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil the iPod era, it seemed entirely possible that Jobs' most \nlasting legacy might be the blockbuster animated features produced by \nPixar, the company he founded after acquiring George Lucas' \ncomputer-graphics lab in 1986. Instead, Pixar turned out to be, in \nJobs' famous phrase, just one more thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1955 in San Francisco to an unmarried graduate student and \nadopted at birth by Paul and Clara Jobs, Steven Paul Jobs grew up in \nSilicon Valley just as it was becoming Silicon Valley. It proved to \nbe a lucky break for everyone concerned.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was only 21 when he started Apple  officially formed on April \nFool's Day, 1976  with his buddy Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak, a self-taught \nengineer of rare talents. (A third founder, Ron Wayne, chickened out \nafter less than two weeks.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jobs had already done a lot of living, all of which influenced \nthe company he built.\u0014",

Gossip and rumors have always \nexisted in this tight-knit community, but before the days of \nanonymous social media sites, people traded stories at the local \ndiner called Dee's Place. At Dee's Place you could usually find a \ndozen longtime residents who gathered each morning to talk about \nweather, politics, and, of course, their neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut of late [the article reports], more people in this hardscrabble \ntown of 5,000 have shifted from sharing the latest news and rumors \nover eggs and coffee to  a social media Web site called Topix, where \nthey write and read startlingly negative posts, all cloaked in \nanonymity, about one another. [Unlike sites like Facebook, which \nrequire users to give their real names, Topix users can pick \ndifferent names and thus remain anonymous.]\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in Dee's Place, people are not happy. A waitress, Pheobe Best, \nsaid that the site had provoked fights and caused divorces. The \ndiner's owner, Jim Deverell, called Topix a \"cesspool of character \nassassination.\" And hearing the conversation, Shane James, the cook, \nwandered out of the kitchen tense with anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis wife, Jennifer, had been the target in a post  which described \nthe mother of two, as among other things, \"a methed-out, doped-out \n[addict] with AIDS\" Not a word was true, Mr. and Mrs. James said, but \nthe consequences were real enough . Now, the couple has resolved to \nmove. \"I'll never come back to this town again,\" Ms. James said in an \ninterview at the diner. \"I just want to get  out of town.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article concludes with a warning about gossip: \"The same Web \nsites created for candid talk about local news and politics are also \nhubs of unsubstantiated gossip, stirring widespread resentment in \ncommunities where ties run deep  and anonymity is something of a \nnovel concept.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA.G.

    "title": "STUDIES ABOUT UNMARRIED COUPLES LIVING TOGETHER",
    "words": "\u0014\nIn the American magazine Seventeen in 1977 called \"The Case against \nLiving Together\" is an interview with Nancy Moore Clatworthy, a \nsociologist at The Ohio State University. For ten years, Clatworthy \nhad been studying the phenomenon of unmarried couples living \ntogether. When she began, she was predisposed towards the custom. \n\"Young people,\" she said, \"have told us it was quite wonderful.\" And \nshe said she believed them. It seemed to her to be a sensible \narrangement, a useful step in courtship in which couples get to know \none another. But her research, involving the testing of hundreds of \ncouples, married and unmarried, led her to change her mind. And she \nconcluded that living together was not doing the things the couples \nexpected it to do, especially with girls. She found them uptight, \nfearful, looking past the rhetoric to the possible pain and agony.\u0014\n\u0014\nClatworthy makes two points: In the areas of happiness, respect, and \nadjustment, \"Couples who live together before they're married have \nmore problems than couples who marry first.\" In every area, the \ncouples who lived together before marriage disagreed more often than \nthe couples who hadn't. Living together, she concludes, doesn't solve \nyour problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer second point was about commitment, the expectation a person has \nabout the outcome of a relationship. Commitment is what makes \nmarriage and living together work. But here's the problem: \"Knowing \nthat something is temporary, like living together unmarried, affects \nthe degree of commitment to it. So unmarried couples are less than \nwholehearted in working to sustain and protect their relationship. \nAnd, consequently, 75 percent of them break up. And especially the \ngirls are badly hurt.\" She concludes, \"Statistically you are much \nbetter off marrying than living together, because for people who are \nin love, anything less than a full commitment is a cop-out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I don't think that Clatworthy is a Christian. Her appeal is not \nto the authority of Scripture but to the findings of sociology. And \nyet her sociological research vindicates the wisdom of Christian \nethics as it applies to the institution of marriage. It reminds us \nthat God's truth has power, in both its biblical and non-biblical \nguises.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Stott: Four Ways Christians Can Influence the World\u0014",

    "words": "Some Baptists Are Eroding Religious Freedom \u0014\nRandy Hyde\u0014\nPosted: Friday, October 21, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nJon Meacham, the esteemed Newsweek religion columnist, is right when \nhe says that calling into question Mitt Romney's faith is \"bad for \nall of us.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, before anyone immediately starts to object that I need to keep \nmy opinions strictly in the realm of spiritual matters and not delve \ninto politics, please hear me out. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, we Baptists historically have had quite a claim on this \nmatter. And, I feel compelled to write about it because recently a \nSouthern Baptist pastor, in introducing one of Romney's GOP \nopponents, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, called Mormonism a cult and \nopined that Romney is not a Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Jeffress, a Dallas megapastor, told reporters that \"those of \nus who are born-again followers of Christ should always prefer a \ncompetent Christian to a competent non-Christian like Mitt Romney.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, Romney's religious faith should preclude Christians \nfrom voting for him. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, in further remarks he let it be known that even Romney would \nbe a better choice than the sitting president, who is an avowed \nChristian. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis only serves to show that Jeffress' motivation is less to promote \nChristian principle than it is his own personal politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince we both share the name \"Baptist\"  Jeffress and I  if not the \nsame way of going about actually being Baptist, I feel it is right \nand good to seek some correction on this matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of one's feelings about Mormonism, what needs to rise to \nthe top of our concern as Baptists ought to be the free exercise of \nreligion ... even for those who aspire to the highest office in our \nland. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou'll find it right there in the First Amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; \nor abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of \nthe people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for \na redress of grievances.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists were instrumental in securing the First Amendment, but now \nare in danger of being identified with those who seek to render it \nmeaningless. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the day comes that a religious test is imposed on those who seek \npublic office, that which we historically have stood for will not \nonly begin to crumble but will fall in a mighty heap. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur nation's founders saw the wisdom of freedom of religion and \nspeech, and we would do well to follow their example.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Williams, who founded the First Baptist Church in America in \nProvidence, R.I., believed that the wall of separation between church \nand state should protect the church from the corruption of the state \n one of his major concerns. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, the danger is that the state (or government) needs to be \nprotected from the influence of the church  or at least from the \ninfluence of certain churchmen like Pastor Jeffress.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, this kind of rhetoric is not newly plowed ground for the \nformer Massachusetts governor to have to endure. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his campaign three years ago, Romney said: \"Perhaps the most \nimportant question to ask a person of faith who seeks a political \noffice is this: Does he share these American values: the equality of \nhumankind, the obligation to serve one another and a steadfast \ncommitment to liberty?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYou do understand, I hope, that no opinion expressed here is an \nendorsement of anyone for any office of any kind. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a defense of a timeless principle that has served our nation \nwell for almost 250 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Baptist voices to speak up, and just as true, it is \ntime for Baptist ears to hear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRandy Hyde is senior pastor of Pulaski Heights Baptist Church in \nLittle Rock, Ark.

    "title": "STEVE JOBS' LAST WORDS",
    "words": "FoxNews  10/31/11\u0014\n\u0014\nSteve Jobs' sister Mona Simpson shared in the eulogy she delivered at \nthe late Apple CEO's memorial service that his surprising final words \nfrom his deathbed were, Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the eulogy, which was printed in The New York Times on Sunday, \nSimpson describes Jobs' final days and moments in a Palo Alto \nhospital, which was spent surrounded by family as his breathing \ngradually became shorter.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis breath, she said, indicated an arduous journey, some steep path, \naltitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nDelivered at the October 16 service for Jobs at Stanford Memorial \nChurch, Simpson, an accomplished novelist, began by describing her \ninitial meeting of her brother for the first time when she was in her \nmid-20s. Simpson was born in 1957, two years after Jobs, who was \ngiven up for adoption as an infant.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to \nlove, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be \nmy father. When I was 25, I met that man and he was my brother, \nSimpson said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimpson went on to describe her strong relationship with the man now \nknow for the revolutionizing computer world, while explaining Jobs' \nwork ethic and capacity for love  particularly for his wife Laurene \nand as a doting father to their three children.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteve was like a girl in the amount of time he spent talking about \nlove. Love was his supreme virtue, his god of gods.

She \nwrote how as a young girl she had hoped for her absent father to be \n\"rich and kind and come into our livesand help\" her and her mom. Her \ndream eventually came true, but through her brother, rather than her \nfather.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to \nlove, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be \nmy father. When I was 25, I met that man and he was my brother,\" she \nwrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs, who was adopted, didn't meet Simpson until they were both \nadults. While living in New York, Simpson was contacted by a lawyer \nin 1985 who notified her that her long-lost brother was \"rich and \nfamous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawyer refused to disclose his client's name, so Simpson's \ncoworkers started a betting pool with actor John Travolta as the \nleading candidate. She shared that she secretly hoped that he was \"a \nliterary descendant of Henry James -- someone more talented than \n[her], someone brilliant without even trying.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I met Steve, he was a guy my age in jeans, Arab- or \nJewish-looking and handsomer than Omar Sharif,\" she wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs and Simpson went for a long walk, where he explained that he was \nin the computer business. Simpson said she had yet to buy a computer \nand was considering buying a Cromemco. Jobs told her that it was a \ngood thing she'd waited, as he was working on something that was \ngoing to be \"insanely beautiful.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSimpson went on to share things she had learned from Jobs during \nthree distinct periods that she called \"states of being:\" his full \nlife, his illness and his dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to her, Jobs wasn't ashamed of working hard even if \"the \nresults were failures.\" After being ousted from Apple, he was \ndisappointed, especially when he wasn't invited to a meeting of 500 \nSilicon Valley leaders with the then U.S. president, but he still \nworked hard at the new company he had started, NeXT.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Novelty was not Steve's highest value. Beauty was,\" Simpson said, \nnoting that he probably owned enough trademark black cotton \nturtleneck shirts for everyone at the memorial service.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilar to an earlier essay where Jobs' first serious girlfriend \nshared about Jobs, Simpson shared how much of a romantic her brother \nwas.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[Jobs] was like a girl in the amount of time he spent talking about \nlove. Love was his supreme virtue, his god of gods,\" she wrote, \nnoting that he would often call out to men he thought women would \nconsider attractive to see if they would come to dinner with Simpson.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimpson also shared how much Jobs was in love with his wife, Laurene, \nsaying that his love for her \"sustained him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jobs became ill, his family \"watched his life compress into a \nsmaller circle,\" Simpson wrote. After his liver transplant in 2009, \nhe had to relearn how to walk.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He tried. He always, always tried, and always with love at the core \nof that effort. He was an intensely emotional man,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nJobs endured the pain for his family, setting goals for himself: his \nson's high school graduation, a trip to Japan with his daughter, the \nlaunching of a boat he was building that he hoped to retire on with \nhis wife. But, some of his goals he was unable to meet. Jobs passed \naway on Oct. 5 at age 56 after a years-long fight with cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecounting the manner in which Jobs approached death, Simpson said \n\"what he was, was how he died.\" According to her, \"death didn't \nhappen to Steve, he achieved it,\" adding that, as his breathing \nslowed, \"he seemed to be climbing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo conclude, Simpson shared how Jobs' final words as he looked at his \nsister Patty, his children and his wife, then over their shoulders, \nwere \"OH WOW.

His legacy includes Mac computers, Apple retail stores, \nPixar studios, iPhone, iPod, iTunes, iPad. There is a biography about \nhim called iCon. He was the inventor or co-inventor on 342 patents or \npatent applications.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe changed the way we think about computers, phones, music, movies, \nand retail stores. He made technology cool, intuitive, elegant, and \neasy to use. His passing leaves a crater.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomebody said ten years ago we had Bob Hope, Johnny Cash, and Steve \nJobs; now we have no Hope, no Cash, and no jobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1800s the American dream was being born in a log cabin and \ngrowing up to be president. In our day it's a kid starting a company \nin his parents' garage that will change the world. That kid was Steve \nJobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow successful is successful enough?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat same week he died, we read about another icon named Al Davis.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a kid from Brooklyn. Not a particular gifted athlete, but by \nsheer tenacity he became the head coach and general manger of the \nOakland Raiders at a younger age than anyone else in professional \nfootball.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an occupation full of the toughest people in the world, nobody was \ntougher than Al Davis. Just win, baby. He willed the Raiders to five \nSuper Bowls. He achieved such prominence that followers around the \ncountry called themselves \"Raider Nation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNFL Films rated the top 10 feuds of all time, and #1 was Al Davis vs. \nthe whole National Football League.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could be extraordinarily generous, but was not given to false \nmodesty or self-doubt. When NY Yankees boss George Steinbrenner died, \nabout a year ago, Al Davis said: \"I judge sports figures based on \nindividual achievement, team achievement, and contributions to the \ngame. George was right up there with me at #1.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow much winning is enough?\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the same day that Al Davis passed away, we read about an artist.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Williams was the first pianist to have his own star on the \nHollywood Walk of Fame.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was called ''Pianist to the Presidents''; he played for nine of \nthem. He was the only pianist to have a #1 song on Billboard charts. \nHe was the best-selling pianist of all time, with 18 gold or platinum \nrecords.\u0014\n\u0014\n(If you are not old, a record was a round thing they used to record \nmusic on.)\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only thathe won a boxing championship in Navy during WW II.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow talented is talented enough?\u0014",

What American \nminister succeeded Jonathan Edwards as President of Princeton \nUniversity? The answer to both questions is Samuel Davies.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel was born on this day, November 3, l723. Evidently, his Baptist \nmother had difficulty conceiving, for years later Samuel wrote, \"I am \na son of prayer, like my namesakeSamuel the prophet; and my mother \ncalled me Samuelbecause, she said, 'I have asked him of the Lord...'\" \nIn that same letter, he remarked that \"the most important blessings \nof my life I have looked upon as immediate answers to the prayers of \na pious mother.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavies was determined to make life count for God. In l740, although \nVirginia's colonial government discriminated against denominations \nother than the official Church of England, it gave Davies a license \nto preach as a Presbyterian minister in four counties, and he used it \nto promote tolerance for all denominations. The persuasive reasoning \nof Davies' eloquent sermons electrified his audiences by combining \nScripture with practical teaching. The patriot orator, Patrick Henry \nfrequently attended Davies' services, and learned some of his \neloquence from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavies also regularly invited three hundred slaves to his home on \nSaturday evenings--their only free time. He taught them to read and \nto sing hymns, many of which he wrote himself. His \"Great God of \nWonders\" and other gospel songs are still found in hymn-books.\u0014\n\u0014\nRealizing the importance of education, Davies helped found Princeton \nUniversity, and was chosen its president after Jonathan Edward's \nsudden death. Yet Davies, too, soon died--at the early at age \nthirty-eight. Like the Old Testament prophet after whom he was named, \nthis eighteenth century Samuel dedicated his life to serving his God \nand his country.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nNinde, Edward S.

You rationalize what you are going \nto do and you justify what you just did. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tCelebrationOver time and with repeated exposure, many men so \ncompletely buy into the deception of pornography that they don't feel \na need to defend their habit.

Adding the second took another 120 or so years. Then, in the \nlast 50 years, humanity more than doubled, surging from three billion \nin 1959 to four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987 and six billion \nin 1998. This rate of population increase has no historical \nprecedent. \u0014\n\u0014\nCan the earth support seven billion now, and the three billion people \nwho are expected to be added by the end of this century? Are the \nenormous increases in households, cities, material consumption and \nwaste compatible with dignity, health, environmental quality and \nfreedom from poverty? \u0014\n\u0014\nFor some in the West, the greatest challenge  because it is the \nleast visible  is to shake off, at last, the view that large and \ngrowing numbers of people represent power and prosperity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis view was fostered over millenniums, by the pronatalism of the \nHebrew Bible, the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church and Arab \nthinkers like Ibn Khaldun. Mercantilists of the 16th through the 18th \ncenturies saw a growing population as increasing national wealth: \nmore workers, more consumers, more soldiers. Enlarging the workforce \ndepressed wages, increasing the economic surplus available to the \nking. The number of the people makes the wealth of states, said \nFrederick the Great. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pronatalism acquired a \nspecious scientific aura from social Darwinism and eugenics. Even \ntoday, some economists argue, incorrectly, that population growth is \nrequired for economic growth and that Africa is underpopulated. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis view made some sense for societies subject to catastrophic \nmortality from famines, plagues and wars. But it has outlived its \nusefulness now that human consumption, and pollution, loom large \nacross the earth. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, while many people reject the equation of human numbers with \npower, it remains unpalatable, if not suicidal, for political leaders \nto admit that the United States and Europe do not need growing \npopulations to prosper and be influential and that rich countries \nshould reduce their rates of unintended pregnancy and help poor \ncountries do likewise. With the globalization of work, the incentive \nfor owners of capital today to ignore or not address rapid growth in \nthe numbers of poor people remains as it was for the kings of yore: \nlower wages for workers at any level of skill offer a bigger economic \nsurplus to be captured. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut just as pronatalism is unjustified, so are the dire  and \ndiscredited  prophecies of Thomas Malthus and his followers, who \nbelieved that soaring populations must lead to mass starvation. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the world is physically capable of feeding, sheltering and \nenriching many more people in the short term. Between 1820, at the \ndawn of the industrial age, and 2008, when the world economy entered \nrecession, economic output per person increased elevenfold.\u0014",

    "words": "A former stray cat in Rome joined the ranks of the world's richest \nanimals when its owner left it $13 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Giselle Smith on Mon, Dec 12, 2011 .MSN \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's hard to imagine an heir more indifferent to his huge inheritance \nthan Tommaso.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 4-year-old Italian black cat -- a former stray on the streets of \nRome -- is apparently now the richest cat in the world, according to \nthe International Business Times.\u0014\n\u0014\nTommaso inherited an estate worth $13 million when its owner, Maria \nAssunta, died two weeks ago at the age of 94, The Telegraph reported. \nAssunta was the widow of a property tycoon, and had no children or \nliving relatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssunta's estate included a large bank balance and property in Rome, \nMilan and Calabria, but Tommaso's care was entrusted to the nurse who \ncared for the cat's owner in her final months. In fact, because \nItalian law doesn't permit animals to inherit property, the attorney \nfor the estate gave the cat and his fortune to Assunta's former nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nTommaso now lives with Assunta's caretaker, Stefania, at an \nundisclosed location outside Rome. \"I had no idea the signora had \nsuch wealth,\" she told The Guardian.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther famously wealthy pets\u0014\n\u0014\nTommaso is the latest in a long line of pets that became millionaires \nupon the death of their wealthy owners.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeona Helmsley's Maltese, Trouble, was probably the most famously \nwealthy pet when his owner died in 2007, leaving $12 million to the \ndog. The dog itself passed away in June, at the age of 12, and the \nmoney reverted to the Helmsley Charitable Trust, The Street reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther rich animals include Alexander McQueen's dogs ($82,000) and \nMichael Jackson's chimp, Bubbles ($1 million). Oprah Winfrey's dogs \nare set to inherit $30 million, according to Woman's Day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, none are as wealthy as an Alsatian dog named Gunther IV, who \ninherited a fortune worth about $372 million from a German countess, \naccording to The Guardian.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is something that has gone from almost a comical thing to \nsomething that people take very seriously and want. People are \nsometimes more interested in taking care of their pets than their \nfamilies,\" Beyer told the Chicago Tribune.\u0014",

    "title": "SUGGESTIONS FOR PASTOR SEARCH COMMITTEES",
    "words": "On the heels of many such conversations, I jotted down some random \nthoughts that, considered at the outset of the search, promote a \nhealthy process. I hope they are helpful.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. This is a spiritual discernment process. The sooner you understand \nthat, the better. Pray. This is more drama than documentary. Pray. \nMore a dance than a march. Pray. Everyone needs to get his or her \nprayer life in order. One more time: Pray.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Your committee needs to experience true community. Work at that. \nIf you approach this deliberately and prayerfully, the many hours you \nspend together will grow you very close to one another. Hopefully, \nthis will turn out to be one of the spiritual highlights of your \nadult life.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Own your agendas. Everyone has them. Identify them and do your \nbest to set them aside in lieu of a divine agenda. That's a lot \nharder than it sounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Remember that you represent the congregation in this process. Your \npersonal agenda or wishes are secondary, at best.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Be honest with yourselves and the candidates you talk with when it \ncomes to your church. No church is perfect. (You'll soon discover \nthat is also true about clergy.)\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Confidentiality is essential. No exceptions.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. What you think you know can hurt you. This is not an executive \nsearch; it is not like filling a position at your company or school \nsystem or nonprofit. Take all your prior experiences and put them \naside. What you are about to do is unlike anything you have ever done.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. What worked for the last search committee probably won't work this \ntime. Things have changed, dramatically, in recent years. Please \ndon't keep talking about last time.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Your success or failure will likely be determined by the work you \ndo as a committee prior to ever having a conversation with a \ncandidate. Please take this part of your task seriously. Seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. The profile your congregation has produced of itself and of your \nnext pastor (hopefully you did this) must be adhered to ruthlessly.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. The more confident in yourselves that you are, the more likely \nyou are to make a wrong turn. Humility is your friend.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. Think like a recruiter rather than an HR professional who posts a \njob and then waits for resumes to arrive.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. You will have to convince your best candidates just to have a \nbrief conversation with you. You are inviting them to introduce \nspiritual discord into their life, not doing them a favor by \nconsidering them.\u0014\n\u0014\n14. It's the small things that will make or break your search. Don't \ntake shortcuts. Pray hard. Be considerate. Don't make promises you \nwon't keep. Practice the Golden Rule with your candidates even when \nno one is looking.\u0014\n\u0014\n15. Beware of becoming enamored by one good sermon. Everyone can \npreach one good sermon. Beware of over-valuing sermons in general. \nMost of what goes awry with pastors takes place between Sundays.\u0014\n\u0014\n16. Hold out for consensus agreement. That doesn't mean everyone is \nequally excited about the candidate, just that you can all stand \nbefore the congregation and present a united front with integrity.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. Be patient. With a healthy search process, fast is slow, and slow \nis fast.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

He was famed as the author of a realistic tale of \nprison existence, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, published \nin 1962. This was based upon his experiences in Stalin's prison \ncamps. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen One Day was accepted for publication, Solzhenitsyn offered up \nthis prayer:\u0014\n\u0014\nHow easy it is for me to live with you, Lord!\u0014\nHow easy for me to believe in you, \u0014\nWhen my spirit is lost, perplexed and cast down, \u0014\nWhen the sharpest can see no further than the night, \u0014\nAnd know not what on the morrow they must do\u0014\nYou give me a sure certainty\u0014\nThat you exist, that you are watching over me\u0014\nAnd will not permit the ways of righteousness to be closed to me. \u0014\nHere on the summit of earthly glory I look back astonished\u0014\nOn the road which through depths of despair has led me here. \u0014\nTo this point from which I can also reflect to men your radiance\u0014\nAnd all that I can still reflect - you shall grant to me. \u0014\nAnd what I shall fail you shall grant to others\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he won the Nobel, Solzhenitsyn found himself in exile. \nHe settled in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, December 28, 1973 a new book by the Nobel-winner \nappeared in the Paris book markets. This book, too, was about \nprison--a documentary of the horrors of the Gulag Archipelago, \nStalin's prison camps in central Asia, a system of inland \"islands\" \nwhich taken together would have been as big as the country of France.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrained as a mathematician, Solzhenitsyn found his fame as an author \ninstead. In 1945, while serving in the Russian army, he was arrested \nand sent to prison for criticizing Russian dictator Josef Stalin in a \nletter. While in prison he met Christians whose faith impressed him, \nand he came to appreciate the deepened understanding of truth which \ncomes through suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day came when he was able to say, \"Bless you, prison, for having \nbeen in my life.\" For in prison, he recognized what a spiritual \nmonster he had been. There he listened to his conscience; there he \nfound God. Prison made him firm.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in exile, Solzhenitsyn not only sought the spiritual renewal of \nhis native Russia, but he also lovingly rebuked the west for its \nmaterialism and growing moral decadence. He continued to publish \nliterary works which documented the moral injustices of the Communist \nstate and the terror under Lenin and Stalin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nNielsen, Niels C., jr.

    "words": "November 29, 257 \u0014\nSaturninus Dragged to Death\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the one who preaches everywhere that our temples must be torn \ndown and who dares to call our gods devils. It is his presence that \nimposes silence on our oracles.\" A man in the crowd outside the pagan \ntemple pointed to Saturninus.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaturninus was in Toulouse as a missionary-bishop by command of \nBishop Fabian of Rome. To get from his home to his small church, he \nhad to pass by the Capitol, the chief pagan temple in the town.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough preaching and miracles, Saturninus converted a number of \nidolaters. Later accounts, which may be legendary, say that a woman \nwith an advanced case of leprosy was restored when Saturninus' prayed \nfor her. When he made the sign of the cross over large numbers of the \nsick, they also were healed.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo doubt their loss of trade stung the pagan priests. The best \nevidence we have suggests that it was on this day, November 29, 257, \nas Saturninus passed by the Capitol, temple leaders seized and \nchained him. They gave him an ultimatum: either worship their gods or \npay with his blood.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout hesitation, Saturninus replied, \"I adore one only God, and to \nhim I am ready to offer a sacrifice of praise. Your gods are devils, \nand are more delighted with the sacrifice of your souls than with \nthose of your bullocks.\" He added, \"How can I fear them who, as you \nacknowledge, tremble before a Christian?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOutraged by this reply, the pagans began to whip the bishop. When \nthey had vented their spite upon him in all sorts of humiliating and \ncruel acts, they looked for a way to kill him.\u0014\n\u0014\nA bull had been brought in for sacrifice. They tied him to the animal \nand set it loose. The maddened creature dashed through town, dragging \nthe faithful bishop to his death. It continued to gallop until the \nropes broke.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo faithful women rescued what was left of the bishop's battered \nbody and hid it in a deep ditch so that the pagans could not vent \ntheir spite on it. Later, Christians gave his body an honorable \nburial.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin two centuries, Christians of Toulouse built a church at the \nvery spot where the ropes had broken and allowed Saturninus' corpse \nto come to rest. It remains to this day and is called the church of \nthe Taur \"The Church of the Bull.\" This day, November 29, is the \nfeast day of saint Saturninus.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Alban. \"Saturninus.\" Lives of the Saints.

One-fourth of 18- to 29-year-olds say church demonizes \neverything outside church, including the music, movies, culture, and \ntechnology that define their generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nShallowness. One-third call church boring, about one-fourth say faith \nis irrelevant and Bible teaching is unclear. One-fifth say God is \nabsent from their church experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-science. Up to one-third say the church is out of step on \nscientific developments and debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nSex. The church is perceived as simplistic and judgmental. For a \nfifth or more, a \"just say no\" philosophy is insufficient in a \ntechno-porno world. Young Christian singles are as sexually active as \ntheir non-churched friends, and many say they feel judged.\u0014\n\u0014\nExclusivity. Three in 10 young people feel the church is too \nexclusive in this pluralistic and multi-cultural age. And the same \nnumber feel forced to choose between their faith and their friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoubters. The church is not a safe place to express doubts say over \none-third of young people, and one-fourth have serious doubts they'd \nlike to discuss.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from a list by David Kinnaman in You Lost Me: Why Young \nChristians are Leaving Church  and Rethinking Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung Exodus\u0014\n\u0014\nSix in 10 young people will leave the church permanently or for an \nextended period starting at age 15, according to new research by the \nBarna Group. And for the generation now coming of age, it's more than \nthe usual \"driver's license to marriage license\" joy ride, according \nto the pollsters. For church leaders, the question is, what will we \ndo about it?\u0014\n\u0014\nToday's young adults are marrying later, if at all, are \ntechnologically savvy, and hold worldviews alien to their upbringing. \nBarna Research president David Kinnaman, after a five-year-study, \ndeclared that church leaders are unequipped to deal with this \"new \nnormal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir response is mostly at the extremes, both dangerous. Many ignore \nthe situation, hoping young adults' views will be righted when they \nare older and have their own children. These leaders miss the \nsignificance of the shifts of the past 25 years, Kinnaman contends, \nand the needs for ministry young people have in their present \nphaseif it is a phase.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the opposite reaction is just as problematic: \"using all means \npossible to make their congregation appeal to teens and young \nadults.\" This excludes older members and \"builds the church on the \npreferences of young people and not on the pursuit of God,\" Kinnaman \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nKinnaman prescribes intergenerational ministry. \"In many churches, \nthis means changing the metaphor from simply passing the baton to the \nnext generation to a more functional, biblical picture of a body - \nthat is, the entire community of faith, across the entire lifespan, \nworking together to fulfill God's purposes.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SPURGEON'S SERVICE AT SURREY GARDENS",
    "words": "October 19, 1856 \u0014\nSpurgeon's Service at Surrey Gardens\u0014\n\u0014\nLondon was all astir with talk of the young preacher Charles Haddon \nSpurgeon. He lacked the flowery, elaborate sentences of most \npreachers, but his simple directness spoke to the hearts of his \naudience. His passion for truth was as strong as the older Puritans \nhe loved and studied, yet there was nothing stale and musty about his \npreaching. Almost as soon as the nineteen year old began his ministry \nat New Park Street Chapel on London's south side, the Chapel became \ntoo small for the congregation. Though the Chapel could seat twelve \nhundred, seats, aisles, and even window-sills were overflowing \nwhenever Spurgeon preached.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year after he arrived at New Park Street, the chapel was expanded, \nbut the larger fifteen-hundred capacity building was not sufficient \nfor the thousands thronging to hear Charles Haddon Spurgeon. For a \ntime the congregation rented Exeter Hall, which seated forty-five \nhundred people, but it soon proved too small as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the crowds expanded, Spurgeon leased the Surrey Music Hall in the \nRoyal Surrey Gardens for services. This was London's \"largest, most \ncommodious and most beautiful building, erected for public \namusements, carnivals of wild beasts and wilder men.\" Many criticized \nSpurgeon for leasing a building designed for worldly amusements, but \nthe hall held ten to twelve thousand people and that number packed \nthe building for the first service on this day, October 19, 1856. It \nseemed at least as many people were outside the building as were \ninside.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe service had only gone a few minutes when there was the \nfrightening cry of \"Fire! the galleries are giving away, the place is \nfalling!\" In the ensuing panic to flee the building, many people were \ntrampled. Seven died and others were seriously injured.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurgeon was tremendously depressed over the event, and his grief was \nso deep some feared his reason had left him. He spent hours \"in tears \nby day, and dreams of terror by night.\" Within two weeks, however, \nSpurgeon had recovered sufficiently to preach again. The crowds were \neven bigger than before.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the spring of 1861, the Metropolitan Tabernacle was completed; \nthis was to be Spurgeon's pulpit for the next thirty-one years. \nThroughout those years an average of five thousand people attended \neach morning and evening Sunday service. Spurgeon's was the \nmegachurch of nineteenth century London.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he constantly preached to a sea of faces, Spurgeon trembled at \nthe multitudes who came to hear him. He was aware of the awesome \nresponsibility of giving them the truth and not just tickling their \nears. In his last sermon at Surrey Hall before moving into the \nMetropolitan Tabernacle he urged his listeners, \"In God's name, I \nbeseech you, flee to Christ for refuge! Shall there be any of you, \nwhom I shall see on my death bed, who shall charge me with being \nunfaithful? Shall these eyes be haunted with visions of men whom I \nhave amused, but into whose heart I have never sought to convey the \ntruth?...God avert that worst of ills --unfaithfulness from my head! \nI pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\n\"Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens; the Surrey Gardens Music Hall \nMinistry.\" http://www.reformedreader.org/spurgeon/mhrsg.htm)/li> \u0014\nConwell, Russell.

    "words": "October 2, 1187 \u0014\nSaladin Captured Jerusalem\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWar is a lot like a gang fight. And woe to the rival who steps on his \nenemy's turf! In the twelfth century, the gang fight was between \nChristian Crusaders and Muslim Saracens. Chatillon, a cruel Crusader, \nmassacred several dozen Muslim pilgrims in cold blood just because \nthey stepped onto his turf. This so maddened Sultan Saladin of the \nSaracens that he vowed revenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin had become Sultan of Egypt in 1174 through a coup. After \nconquering Syria and Damascus, he led the Saracens in victory over \nthe Crusaders on the plain of Tiberias in 1187. With his own \nscimitar, he kept his promise and slew Chatillon. The rival gangs \nnext \"rumbled\" over Jerusalem. On this day, October 2, 1187, the \nMuslim general captured the holy city. Muslims immediately clambered \nup and removed the cross that the Crusaders had mounted on the cupola \nof the Dome of the Rock. According to an eyewitness, the combined \nroar of the Muslims shouting \"Allah is greatest!\" and the groans of \nthe defeated Crusaders, watching the fall of their sacred symbol, was \nso loud it shook the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin shamed the ruthless Crusaders by treating the city with \nkindness and keeping every promise he made to its people. Islam \ncontrolled Jerusalem from that day until the 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin hoped to hold all of Palestine. However, Crusaders Richard \nLionheart and Philip Augustus of France soon recaptured Acre. Richard \nLionheart defeated the Saladin again, dashing Saracen hopes of total \ncontrol. The Lionheart perpetrated atrocities to equal the other \nCrusaders. Yet his personal strength and valor made him legendary. He \nis said to have struck down four hundred men by himself in one battle \nalone. Faced with such a foe, Saladin finally agreed to a treaty that \npermitted Europeans to hold ports on the Palestine coast. Christians \nwere allowed to make pilgrimages to sacred shrines in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin's courage, justice and moderation were rare in that age and \nhave won him lasting respect in the West. Christians thought they \nwere justified in launching the crusades. They argued that their \nactions were defensive-- preemptive strikes to keep Islam from \nrenewing its attacks on Europe--and that they were just taking back \nturf the Saracens had snatched earlier. Whether their arguments are \nvalid or not, one thing is certain: They did not live up to Christ's \nteachings about love after they had conquered the Middle East. What a \ndifferent tale the Crusaders might have told if they had at least \nlived up to Saladin's code, even it they were unable to abide by the \nlaw of love!\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Crusades.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

Was there some fault in \nhim that God would send the rest of the church leaders to death but \nspare him?\u0014\n\u0014\nSixtus II, Bishop of Rome (pope) in the year 258, comforted Lawrence. \nGod was keeping him back to undergo an even greater ordeal, said the \nbishop. \"Be comforted, you will follow me in three days,\" he is \nsupposed to have predicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman emperor, Valerian, had ordered the death of all Rome's \nbishops, priests and deacons. The prefect (Roman magistrate) who \ncarried out the order, however, knew that, as deacon, Lawrence had \ncharge of the church's money. \"I'll let you go free,\" he promised, \n\"if you will turn the money over to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the oldest traditions we have, Lawrence agreed to bring \nthe church's treasures to the prefect. \"But it will take me a few \ndays,\" he said. \"The church is very rich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReleased to carry out his promise, Lawrence distributed the church's \ngoods among the poor. He then gathered the city's lame, its blind, \nand its beggars. On the third day he appeared before the prefect. \n\"Come out and see the wondrous riches of God,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" raged the prefect.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawrence explained that these poor people would some day have new \nbodies and live forever in Heaven. The treasure of the Holy Spirit \nwas hidden in them as if in jars of clay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThwarted from getting his gold and believing that he would be the \nlaughing stock of Rome, the prefect ordered a slow death for \nLawrence. On this day, August 10, 258, Lawrence was tortured by \nhaving his arms dislocated and then was laid upon a grill and slowly \nroasted to death. During his ordeal, he is said to have suggested his \nkillers turn him over, remarking that he was \"done\" on the one side. \nHe was so calm that the pagans who looked on were greatly \nimpressed.That is how the legends tell the story, but the facts are \nnot easy to establish. What is certain is that Lawrence was martyred \non this day. A hundred years later his story was so well known that \nthe famous Bishop Ambrose of Milan wrote about him and so did others. \nBy then, emperor Constantine had long since built a chapel in his \nmemory.

    "title": "SUSTAINED BY A PROMISE",
    "words": "Wayne Oates was a psychologist and religious educator who coined the \nword 'workaholic.' Oats wrote fifty-seven books, many of them dealing \nwith pastoral psychology. He was a great man who influenced many \npeople, particularly thousands of pastors over his lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his autobiography, which is titled The Struggle to be Free, Oates \ndescribed his growing up years. Wayne Oates knew what it was to \nstruggle. Born to a poor family in Greenville, South Carolina in June \n1917, Oates was abandoned by his father in infancy and was brought up \nby his grandmother and his sister while his mother supported them by \nworking in a cotton mill. His mother made $30 a week. They survived, \nsays one source, on pinto beans, turnip greens, cornbread and \nmolasses. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his early school years, Oates discovered he had the ability to \nexcel academically. And if he was ever going to get out of the mill \ntown, out of poverty, that might be his way. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trouble was, says this source, at age 14 everybody had to go \nto work in the mill and that meant you never graduated from high \nschool. He was tempted to quit studying, but his grandmother told him \nto keep trying and to remember that life was like a funnel, and that \nif you started on the small end, the difficult end, the tough end [of \nthe funnel] that then life began to broaden out. But if you started \nat the easy end, the broad end, life became more narrow all the \ntime. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat an interesting philosophy!\u0014\n\u0014\nWayne Oates worked hard and he had an amazing break at the tender age \nof fourteen. He was one of a small number of impoverished but bright \nboys selected by a congressman to serve as a page in the United \nStates House of Representatives. This was a life-changing experience, \nbut it didn't keep Oates out of the mill forever. Sixteen is the \nhighest age you can be a page and so he had to go back to Greenville \nand his work at the mill. But he had tasted something more in \nWashington and so he insisted on finishing high school. He worked his \nway through Wake Forest University then went on to Southern Seminary, \nthe first of his family to get a higher education. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe writes in his book how difficult it was to leave that mill town \nand how much the peer pressure was to stay, not to leave. People were \nsaying, So you think you're too good to work in the mill, huh? Think \nyou're better than we are, do you? Just don't want to have anything \nto do with hard working folks like us, is that it? I never thought \nyou, Wayne, of all people would ever desert your family.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut it wasn't that Wayne Oates felt better than his peers, nor that \nhe wanted to desert his family and friends. It was simply that Wayne \nOates was sustained by a promise, the promise of his grandmother that \nif he kept trying, he would eventually end up at the broad end of the \nfunnel. He was also sustained by God's promise that whatever came, he \nwould never be alone. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThat promise has sustained millions of people through the centuries. \nChristians do not look at life through rose-colored glasses. We know \nthere will be storms. We know the flood waters will rise, but God has \npromised us that they will never overwhelm us, and so, in the storm \nwe look for the sign of a rainbow. And it's there . . . and it will \nalways be there. Even more important, we can see that promise in the \ncross upon which Christ died. God has made a covenant with us and \nthat covenant will not fail.\u0014",

    "title": "SHOULD WE BLAME FOR TRAGEDIES, DEATH?",
    "words": "Should We Blame God for Tragedies, Deaths? \u0014\nMiguel De La Torre\u0014\nPosted: Wednesday, April 25, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nAll have faced, or will face, tragedy, misery, illness and death. \nEvents will occur that appear unfair, leading most of us to question \nif any sense of cosmic justice and mercy truly exists. \u0014\n\u0014\nNatural disasters will claim thousands of lives, and the victims will \ninclude the innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany have referred to this dilemma as the theodicy question. How can \nan all-loving, all-powerful God allow evil to occur?\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus asks, \"What person among you, if asked by their child for a \nloaf would give a stone? Of if asked for a fish will give a snake? \nIf, then, you, who are evil, know to give good gifts to your \nchildren, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things \nto those that ask?\" (Matthew 7:9-11).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, reading the morning paper, one finds stories where many suffer \nunder moral evils (those actions caused by humans) and natural evils \n(those actions caused by nature).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we consider the billions of senseless deaths, tragedies and \natrocities that define human history, it would seem that history \ndenies more than it confirms the paternal love of a caring and \nmerciful father God.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne is forced to ask: Where is God?\u0014\n\u0014\nComparing Jesus' words with the reality of evil in our global economy \nseems to indicate that earthly parents, rather than God, know better \nabout how to care for their children.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is God who appears to be giving the tens of thousands who die each \nday of hunger and preventable diseases a stone when they are begging \nfor bread, or hands them a snake when they are praying for fish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a very real way, the search for the historical Satan is an attempt \nto justify God's grace while legitimizing the reality and presence of \nevil in human history.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt appears that the development of Satan was, to a certain extent, \ntrying to save God from appearing as the source of evil that is so \nmuch a part of the reality of human suffering and death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scriptures attempt to convince us that God is still worthy of our \nworship despite the presence of evil, even though the most troubling \nconclusion derived from the Judeo-Christian biblical text is the \ndiscovery of a God who is the cause and author of all that is good  \nand all that is evil.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If there is evil in a city, has Yahweh not done it?\" (Amos 3:6). \"I \nform light and create darkness, make peace and create evil, I Yahweh \ndo all these things\" (Isaiah 45:7). This is a God who sends evil \nspirits to torment, as in the case of Saul (1 Samuel 18:10) or \nJeroboam (1 Kings 14:10).\u0014\n\u0014\nEvil befalls a person like Job because God directs it to be so. We \nare left with the troubling answer from God as to why evil befell \nsuch a faithful person: \"Because I wanted to\" is the heavenly \nresponse we hear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe early shapers of sacred texts and religious traditions found \nthemselves in the position of having to protect God from accusations \nof being the source of evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it became less acceptable to have aspects of God represented in \nevil elements or events, independent evil figures had to be birthed. \nIf Satan did not exist, then perhaps he would have had to be created \nto serve as an adversary so as to vindicate God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs troublesome as it may be to conceive of God as being the author of \nmalevolent acts, more bothersome yet is the creation of another \nsupernatural being in competition with God within a strictly \nmonotheistic religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nA simple good-versus-evil binary understanding of reality leads to an \nethical perspective that might cause more evil than good.\u0014\n\u0014\nA world where everyone and everything is either with or against God \nleads to great atrocities by those \"with God\" in their defense \nagainst the perceived threat of those \"against God\" (who those on \nGod's side usually define as satanic).\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause such an ethical framework causes more evil than good, we are \nin need of a new way of understanding what is satanic, what is Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if, instead, our understanding of Satan was influenced by the \nconcept of the \"trickster\" figure that seems to be present in the \nHebrew Bible? \u0014\n\u0014\nLearning to interpret Satan as the ultimate trickster, rather than \nthe embodiment of absolute Evil, can lead to ethical praxes that are \nmore liberative because they deal with the causes of oppressive \nstructures in the physical world rather than simply blaming the \npresent reality on the metaphysical reality of evil or on the moral \ndepravity of humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nTricksters create situations that force the one being tested to look \nfor new ways by which to deal with the discord that has entered their \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat society normalizes can mask oppressive structures that make \nresistance seem futile as both those who benefit from and those \nafflicted by those structures are lulled into complicity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking new alternatives to the surrounding trials and tribulations \ncan lead the one being tested to discover opportunities previously \nunrecognized.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, it could raise the consciousness of the one benefitting \nfrom the status quo, leading them to repentance and to a more \nliberative course of action that can result in the former oppressors \ndiscovering their own salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan's role becomes a bit more complex than being simply evil \nincarnate. The trickster's role can lead to good, as in the case of \nraising consciousness. But it can also lead to destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrials and tribulations can lead Christians to be of good cheer \nbecause they recognize that Christ who is with them has overcome the \nworld. Or they can lead them to greater misery and destruction \nbecause they refuse grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they believe the deception of Satan's tricks, rather than rise \nabove it, they can face devastation. It does not depend on Satan, an \nimplement used by God, but rather, it depends on humans and the \nchoices they make.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe de-emphasizing of a binary system of either absolute Good or \nabsolute Evil moves us away from the impossible task of maintaining \nan ethical framework where either we emulate God's pure goodness or \nwe become wretched creatures under Satan's control.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many religious leaders, congregations and movements attempt \npurity and self-righteousness only to ignore their darker side, and \nin so doing, fall victim to what they proposed to battle by \npersecuting others who fall short of their lofty and righteous \nexpectations?\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel A. De La Torre is professor of social ethics at Iliff School \nof Theology.\u0014",

Tullian offers the \nfollowing personal story to illustrate this truth:\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven years ago, after 41 years of marriage, my parents got divorced. \nIt wasn't because of infidelity or abuse, physically or emotionally. \nMy family and I still scratch our heads and wonder exactly what \nhappened. Was it really a case of irreconcilable differences? I don't \nthink that's possible for Christians because of the power of the \ngospel. It was an incredibly painful time for my siblings and me. We \nexperienced a happy, healthy, loving home growing up. We had \nremarkable parents, and they provided the stability we needed as \nchildren. I don't know what it's like for a mom and dad to go through \na divorce while their children are young. All I know is that it's \nweird to watch your parents' divorce in the stage of life where you \nhave to explain it to your own kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible states clearly that God hates divorce. It grieves his \nheart. There was nothing about my parents' divorce that seemed \nredemptive. I couldn't understand why God allowed it to happen. I was \nstruggling with the whole situation, not simply because I was sad \nthat my mom and dad apparently could not keep the promises they made \nto one another 41 years earlier, but because part of my identity was \nwrapped up in being the son of my parents. I felt important because \nof their standing in society. My mom and dad were remarkable citizens \nand church people. Their reputation made me feel significant. I \nrealized years later that much of the devastation I had experienced \nwas due to the fact that I had idolized my parents and their \nreputation.\u0014\n\u0014\nTullian concludes: \"If the foundation of your happiness is your \nvocation, your relationships, or your money, then suffering takes \nyour source of joy away from you. But if your ultimate value in life \nis God, then suffering drives you closer to your source of joyGod.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n2013\u0014",

Was there some fault in \nhim that God would send the rest of the church leaders to death but \nspare him?\u0014\n\u0014\nSixtus II, Bishop of Rome (pope) in the year 258, comforted Lawrence. \nGod was keeping him back to undergo an even greater ordeal, said the \nbishop. \"Be comforted, you will follow me in three days,\" he is \nsupposed to have predicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman emperor, Valerian, had ordered the death of all Rome's \nbishops, priests and deacons. The prefect (Roman magistrate) who \ncarried out the order, however, knew that, as deacon, Lawrence had \ncharge of the church's money. \"I'll let you go free,\" he promised, \n\"if you will turn the money over to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the oldest traditions we have, Lawrence agreed to bring \nthe church's treasures to the prefect. \"But it will take me a few \ndays,\" he said. \"The church is very rich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReleased to carry out his promise, Lawrence distributed the church's \ngoods among the poor. He then gathered the city's lame, its blind, \nand its beggars. On the third day he appeared before the prefect. \n\"Come out and see the wondrous riches of God,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" raged the prefect.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawrence explained that these poor people would some day have new \nbodies and live forever in Heaven. The treasure of the Holy Spirit \nwas hidden in them as if in jars of clay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThwarted from getting his gold and believing that he would be the \nlaughing stock of Rome, the prefect ordered a slow death for \nLawrence. On this day, August 10, 258, Lawrence was tortured by \nhaving his arms dislocated and then was laid upon a grill and slowly \nroasted to death. During his ordeal, he is said to have suggested his \nkillers turn him over, remarking that he was \"done\" on the one side. \nHe was so calm that the pagans who looked on were greatly impressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is how the legends tell the story, but the facts are not easy to \nestablish. What is certain is that Lawrence was martyred on this day. \nA hundred years later his story was so well known that the famous \nBishop Ambrose of Milan wrote about him and so did others.

    "words": "February 20, 1636 \u0014\nRutherford Exiled for Publishing\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNot many pastors rise at 3 A.M. to be sure they have sufficient time \nfor God and their people. Samuel Rutherford was one who did. Thus it \ncame as a great blow to him when he was compelled to leave the folk \nhe loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRutherford had published an Apology of Divine Grace against the \nheresy of righteousness based on human works. This work offended the \ngovernment. On this day, February 20, 1636, Archbishop Laud, who \ncontrolled the established churches of Britain, exiled Rutherford to \nAberdeen. He forbade him to preach anywhere in Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem Rutherford could not be blamed if he slipped into \ndepression. The years had not been kind to him. In 1630, after barely \nfive years of marriage, his wife died following a painful illness of \nthirteen months. Their two children also died, and Samuel himself \nsuffered a debilitating fever for three months. Now he was in exile, \nexcluded from the work he cherished most.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut rather than become depressed, he wrote encouraging letters to his \nfriends and his church home. These are full of wise and pithy \nsayings: \"Duties are ours, and events are the Lord's.\" Or, \"It is not \nfor us to set an hourglass to the Creator of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hundreds of letters he wrote in exile became a classic. Full of \nencouragement and loving devotion to Christ, they showed that \nRutherford had an intimate communion with the Lord and was not afraid \nto talk about it. He always wrote about Christ and the wondrous glory \nof His Person. Charles Haddon Spurgeon later said, \"When we are dead \nand gone, let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters \nto be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the \nwritings of mere man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638 Rutherford was restored to his church. His many sufferings \ngave him even greater sympathy for the suffering in his flock.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1640s, Rutherford represented the church of Scotland in \nthe Westminster Assembly in London. He helped author the Shorter \nCatechism, with its famous beginning, \"What is the chief end of man?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGlimpses #95.

    "title": "SHE'S INNOCENT. WE'RE GUILTY",
    "words": "Shes Innocent. Were Guilty\u0014\n\u0014\nBy JULIA BAIRD\u0014\nPublished: June 15, 2012, New York Times\u0014\nSydney, Australia\u0014\n\u0014\nULURU, the large red rock in the Australian outback, is a sacred site \nfor aboriginal people. Photographs do not convey how dramatically it \nlooms: an enormous crimson heart in the middle of thousands of miles \nof flat, muted desert. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was here, on Aug. 17, 1980, that a dingo  an Australian wild dog \n dragged a baby called Azaria Chamberlain from a tent as her parents \nsat by the campfire. Her body was never found. \u0014\n\u0014\nAzarias desperate mother, Lindy, was accused of lying, convicted of \nmurder and sent to prison. The film about her, A Cry in the Dark, \nstarring Meryl Streep, spawned a thousand jokes: A dingos got my \nbaby! It was not until this week that Lindy and her ex-husband, \nMichael, were finally given the vindication they longed for: a death \ncertificate that stated that the cause of Azarias death was a dingo \nattack. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did it take three decades, tens of millions of dollars, a \ncriminal case appealed in Australias highest court, a royal \ncommission and four inquests to establish Lindy Chamberlains \ninnocence? In that time, Australias population grew from 14.5 \nmillion to almost 23 million. The case has been a spectacular example \nof poor forensic science, anxiety about evil mothers and suspicion \nof religiosity  the Chamberlains are members of the Seventh-day \nAdventist Church, which was wrongly portrayed as an infant-slaying \ncult. Rumors circulated that Azaria meant sacrifice in the \nwilderness in Hebrew, not blessed of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Australians thought the dingo was a flimsy excuse. Few people, \nexcept park rangers, believed a dingo would attack a baby, and the \nevidence indigenous trackers gave about drag marks near the tent was \nbrushed aside. In a 1984 poll, 76.8 percent of Australians said Lindy \nChamberlain was guilty, and the investigation did little to change \ntheir minds. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen there was Lindy Chamberlain herself. She was thought too sexy \nand cold; she walked into court with a face set like concrete under \nlarge black sunglasses and severely cut black hair. Much was made of \nher bare, tanned shoulders, her expansive wardrobe and her stoicism. \nWhen she did not weep on cue, no one suggested she might have been \nsuffering from shock or trauma. Even worse, she was accused of \nplaying to the cameras that were constantly thrust in her face. She \nwas, we were told, more interested in looking pretty than in the \ndeath of her child. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was a woman, as the prosecution put it, who could murder a baby \nwith nail scissors in the front seat of her car before stuffing the \nbody into a camera case. When a forensic expert claimed there were \nbloodstains in the front of the Chamberlains car, those harboring \nsuspicions were triumphant. Guilty! People spat on her as she walked \ninto the courtroom. It took years before it emerged that the marks \nwere from a chemical spray and old milk. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen A Cry in the Dark was released in 1988, it presented a \nsignificant challenge to public opinion, coming as it did on the \nheels of a commission that established serious bungling of evidence \nby the police and judiciary and overturned the conviction for which \nLindy Chamberlain served three years. The movie offered a sympathetic \nportrayal of a woman struck by an inexplicable tragedy and then \naccused of an inexplicable crime. By then, she had already given \nbirth in prison to her fourth child, who lived with foster parents \nuntil her mother was released. Many people wrote her apologetic \nletters after seeing the film. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the coroner tearfully declared the Chamberlains innocent this \nweek and gave them Azarias correct death certificate, there was a \nsurprising display of grief and shame in Australia. Comedians issued \npublic apologies for using Lindy Chamberlain as a punch line; TV \nhosts were grave and emotional. Azaria would have turned 32 on June \n11; her parents faces crumpled when reminded of it. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Australian historian Michelle Arrow, who has co-edited a book \nabout the case, believes it was such an engrossing spectacle that we \nstill bear a psychic scar from it. Part of the witch hunt, \ncertainly, was about the way white Europeans viewed aboriginal land; \nas a remote place where sinister things would happen, a place of dark \nmagic where a young mother would slit her babys throat as a \nsacrifice to God. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe see now that our willingness to believe that was a collective \nfailure of empathy. We assumed an innocent woman was guilty. We threw \nrocks at a grieving mother. And a nation founded by convicts somehow \nforgot the presumption of innocence. \u0014\n\u0014\nLindy Chamberlain is writing a book on forgiveness now. She has \nlearned how to absolve those who mocked, vilified and condemned her. \nWe should take longer to forgive ourselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nJulia Baird, a journalist, is the author of Media Tarts: How the \nAustralian Press Frames Female Politicians.\u0014",

    "title": "SHOULD WE BLAME GOD FOR TRAGEDIES, DEATHS?",
    "words": "Should We Blame God for Tragedies, Deaths? \u0014\nMiguel De La Torre\u0014\nApril 25, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nAll have faced, or will face, tragedy, misery, illness and death. \nEvents will occur that appear unfair, leading most of us to question \nif any sense of cosmic justice and mercy truly exists. \u0014\n\u0014\nNatural disasters will claim thousands of lives, and the victims will \ninclude the innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany have referred to this dilemma as the theodicy question. How can \nan all-loving, all-powerful God allow evil to occur?\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus asks, \"What person among you, if asked by their child for a \nloaf would give a stone? Of if asked for a fish will give a snake? \nIf, then, you, who are evil, know to give good gifts to your \nchildren, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things \nto those that ask?\" (Matthew 7:9-11).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, reading the morning paper, one finds stories where many suffer \nunder moral evils (those actions caused by humans) and natural evils \n(those actions caused by nature).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we consider the billions of senseless deaths, tragedies and \natrocities that define human history, it would seem that history \ndenies more than it confirms the paternal love of a caring and \nmerciful father God.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne is forced to ask: Where is God?\u0014\n\u0014\nComparing Jesus' words with the reality of evil in our global economy \nseems to indicate that earthly parents, rather than God, know better \nabout how to care for their children.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is God who appears to be giving the tens of thousands who die each \nday of hunger and preventable diseases a stone when they are begging \nfor bread, or hands them a snake when they are praying for fish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a very real way, the search for the historical Satan is an attempt \nto justify God's grace while legitimizing the reality and presence of \nevil in human history.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt appears that the development of Satan was, to a certain extent, \ntrying to save God from appearing as the source of evil that is so \nmuch a part of the reality of human suffering and death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Scriptures attempt to convince us that God is still worthy of our \nworship despite the presence of evil, even though the most troubling \nconclusion derived from the Judeo-Christian biblical text is the \ndiscovery of a God who is the cause and author of all that is good  \nand all that is evil.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If there is evil in a city, has Yahweh not done it?\" (Amos 3:6). \"I \nform light and create darkness, make peace and create evil, I Yahweh \ndo all these things\" (Isaiah 45:7). This is a God who sends evil \nspirits to torment, as in the case of Saul (1 Samuel 18:10) or \nJeroboam (1 Kings 14:10).\u0014\n\u0014\nEvil befalls a person like Job because God directs it to be so. We \nare left with the troubling answer from God as to why evil befell \nsuch a faithful person: \"Because I wanted to\" is the heavenly \nresponse we hear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe early shapers of sacred texts and religious traditions found \nthemselves in the position of having to protect God from accusations \nof being the source of evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it became less acceptable to have aspects of God represented in \nevil elements or events, independent evil figures had to be birthed. \nIf Satan did not exist, then perhaps he would have had to be created \nto serve as an adversary so as to vindicate God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs troublesome as it may be to conceive of God as being the author of \nmalevolent acts, more bothersome yet is the creation of another \nsupernatural being in competition with God within a strictly \nmonotheistic religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nA simple good-versus-evil binary understanding of reality leads to an \nethical perspective that might cause more evil than good.\u0014\n\u0014\nA world where everyone and everything is either with or against God \nleads to great atrocities by those \"with God\" in their defense \nagainst the perceived threat of those \"against God\" (who those on \nGod's side usually define as satanic).\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause such an ethical framework causes more evil than good, we are \nin need of a new way of understanding what is satanic, what is Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if, instead, our understanding of Satan was influenced by the \nconcept of the \"trickster\" figure that seems to be present in the \nHebrew Bible? \u0014\n\u0014\nLearning to interpret Satan as the ultimate trickster, rather than \nthe embodiment of absolute Evil, can lead to ethical praxes that are \nmore liberative because they deal with the causes of oppressive \nstructures in the physical world rather than simply blaming the \npresent reality on the metaphysical reality of evil or on the moral \ndepravity of humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nTricksters create situations that force the one being tested to look \nfor new ways by which to deal with the discord that has entered their \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat society normalizes can mask oppressive structures that make \nresistance seem futile as both those who benefit from and those \nafflicted by those structures are lulled into complicity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking new alternatives to the surrounding trials and tribulations \ncan lead the one being tested to discover opportunities previously \nunrecognized.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, it could raise the consciousness of the one benefitting \nfrom the status quo, leading them to repentance and to a more \nliberative course of action that can result in the former oppressors \ndiscovering their own salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan's role becomes a bit more complex than being simply evil \nincarnate. The trickster's role can lead to good, as in the case of \nraising consciousness. But it can also lead to destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrials and tribulations can lead Christians to be of good cheer \nbecause they recognize that Christ who is with them has overcome the \nworld. Or they can lead them to greater misery and destruction \nbecause they refuse grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they believe the deception of Satan's tricks, rather than rise \nabove it, they can face devastation. It does not depend on Satan, an \nimplement used by God, but rather, it depends on humans and the \nchoices they make.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe de-emphasizing of a binary system of either absolute Good or \nabsolute Evil moves us away from the impossible task of maintaining \nan ethical framework where either we emulate God's pure goodness or \nwe become wretched creatures under Satan's control.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many religious leaders, congregations and movements attempt \npurity and self-righteousness only to ignore their darker side, and \nin so doing, fall victim to what they proposed to battle by \npersecuting others who fall short of their lofty and righteous \nexpectations?\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel A.

    "words": "Should Churches Display the American Flag in Their Sanctuaries?\u0014\n\u0014\nJust Don't do it\u0014\n\u0014\nDouglas Wilson is pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, and \nauthor of many books, including Letter from a Christian Citizen \n(American Vision, 2007).\u0014\n\u0014\nA Christian church has absolutely no business displaying a national \nflag in the sanctuary, at least not as it is commonly done. The \nchurch born at Pentecost was a reversal of Babel, not a doubling down \non the fragmentation of Babel. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur churches should not place any unnecessary barriers to the worship \nof visiting Koreans, Russians, or Portuguese. We already must deal \nwith natural and providential barriers, such as differences in \nlanguage. In Christ there is neither Jew nor Gentile (Gal. 3:28). I \nwouldn't want to worship in a sanctuary with a Scythian flag up front \n(Col. 3:11), and the Golden Rule requires that we not do to the \nvisiting Scythians what we didn't very much like when they did it to \nus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament is all about this principle. Where customs \ninterfere with transnational fellowship, those customs must give way \n(Acts 15:29). \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, I do want to note that this should be taken as a general \nprincipled stand, which is not the same as a perfectionistic one. I \nam not interested in applying any strictures to churches that are \nrenting space in American Legion halls or in high school gyms, where \na flag would already be displayed in the ordinary course of things. I \nam simply arguing that the flag up front should not be part of how \nthe church as the church arranges things. When we in the church have \na decision to make, we shouldn't decide in favor of displaying \nnational flags.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the church places an American flag in the front of the sanctuary, \nthis becomes part of our sacred architecture, and therefore says \nsomething. It becomes a shaping influence.\u0014",

Although the SBC saw slight \nincreases in baptisms and the number of congregations in 2011, its \noverall membership dropped for the fifth straight year, to just under \n16 million. Ed Stetzer, vice president for research at LifeWay \nChristian Resources, says the patterns behind the raw numbers are of \neven greater concern. Many have noted the long-term decline of \nAmerica's mainstream denominations, such as the United Methodist \nChurch, but Stetzer argues that the SBC is locked in its own cycle of \nstagnation. Unless the denomination changes its approach to \nevangelism and church planting, he says, Baptists should expect the \nnumbers to get even worse. \u0014\n\u0014\nBased on the current trajectory, Stetzer writes, \"we are catching up \nwith the Methodists, and will match their decline rate consistently \nby 2018.\" Duke Divinity School professor Curtis Freeman counters that \nthe SBC's traditional commitment to evangelism had forestalled the \nnumerical freefall experienced by mainline denominations, but that \ngrowth in any church was simply becoming more difficult. \"The tide is \ngoing a different way,\" he said. \"[America is] increasingly becoming \na secular culture, not a Christian culture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 7/10/12\u0014",

    "title": "SCHISM BETWEEN EAST AND WEST BEGAN",
    "words": "July 6, 1054 \u0014\n\u0014\nSchism between East and West Began \u0014\n\u0014\nThe division of the Roman Empire into halves was eventually echoed in \nthe church. The break came when Michael Cerularius was Patriarch of \nConstantinople and St. Leo pope in Rome. In 1053, Cerularius \ncirculated a treatise criticizing in strong terms the practices of \nthe Western church. Catholics did not allow their clergy to marry. \nThis was contrary to scripture and tradition, said Cerularius. And \nCatholics used unleavened bread in their Eucharist. But the most \nserious concern was that the Latin church had added the word \n\"filoque\" to the Nicene creed, saying the Holy Spirit proceeded from \nboth Father and Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would seem that this was more political to Leo than religious, as \nit was pressed upon him by the Franks. Cerularius excommunicated all \nbishops of Constantinople who used the Western ritual and closed down \ntheir churches. This incensed Leo. He demanded that Cerularius submit \nto the pope. Any church which refused to recognize the pontiff as \nsupreme was an assembly of heretics, he said--a synagogue of Satan. \nThe Eastern patriarch wasn't about to accept this characterization. \nThe five patriarchs, Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Constantinople \nand Rome were equals in his eyes. The bishop of Rome, as patriarch of \nthe West, was given the courtesy title of \"first among equals\" and in \na tie vote he could make the final determination according to \ntradition. Rome's growing claims to authority were deemed \nunacceptable to the other patriarchs, who believed (and who still \nbelieve) that Christ alone is the head of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo sent legates, headed by an unyielding man, Cardinal Humbert, to \ndiscuss the issues. Before they could complete their mission, Leo \ndied. Humbert was so rude to Cerularius that Cerularius refused to \nspeak with him. Aggravated by this treatment, the legates marched \ninto St. Sophiaon this day, July 6, 1054, and placed a bull on the \naltar, excommunicating Cerularius. After this act, Humbert made a \ngrand exit, shaking the dust off his feet and calling on God to judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nCerularius convoked a council and once more blasted Western \npractices. Humbert was anathematized. The Orthodox condemned all who \nhad drawn up the bull. There was no chance of reconciliation between \nthe factions. The once-united Church was now divided into two: \nEastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic. In many areas, Orthodox churches \nsubmitted to Rome while maintaining many of their rites and \ntraditions. These became the Byzantine rite or Uniate churches, which \nstill exist in countries as distant in time and place as the United \nStates.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rift was inevitable. Traditions and doctrine had been diverging \nfor hundreds of years. East and West would be even farther apart \nafter the cruelties of the crusaders, whose violent acts were often \nagainst fellow-believers of the East whom, in ignorance they did not \nrecognize as Christians. The unity of love which Christ had said \nshould mark his followers was broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDawley, Powel Mills. Chapters in Church History.

    "words": "Second-Graders Know How to Respond to Homeless\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Trevor Barton\u0014\nPosted: Friday, July 20, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMy students had questions about the central character in the story \n\"Fly Away Home\" written by Eve Bunting and illustrated by Ronald \nHimler. And even as second-graders, they knew something about the \nproblem. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Homelessness is mean,\" said James. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I pass the Salvation Army on my bus on the way to school every day. \nI know homeless people sleep there,\" Billy added.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fly Away Home\" tells the story of a boy who lives in an airport with \nhis dad because they have lost their home. They move through the \nterminals to avoid being noticed by passengers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story places you in the boy's shoes and helps you see the world \nthrough his eyes. You feel the pain of the dad who can no longer \nprovide a home for his family. You experience what it's like to have \nall of your possessions in two blue bags.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is just the right book to help students and teachers think about \nhow we view people who are homeless.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter reading the story to my students, I asked a few questions about \nhomelessness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing homeless is \"when you don't have a house to live in,\" said \nImani. \"You know, you have to live under a bridge or on the streets.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Are there homeless people in Greenville?\" asked Madi.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadi's question took me back to that morning in the school office. A \nman came through the door with two new students, a kindergartner and \nhis second-grade sister.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm with the Greenville Area Interfaith Hospitality Network,\" he \nexplained, giving me a card with his name and phone number on it. \"We \nhelp families make the transition from homelessness to transitional \nhousing to owning their own homes. These children are in our program. \nPlease call me if you need more information.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI introduced myself to the children and escorted them to the \ncafeteria for breakfast.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are homeless people in Greenville, S.C., and in every city in \nthe United States. There are homeless children in our school. There \nis a homeless child in my class.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they knew, the child's story would put a face on the word \n\"homeless\" for them, as it had for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the classroom discussion continued, I asked what we should do \nabout those who don't have homes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can make sure you're kind to people when you see them downtown,\" \nsaid James.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can make sure there are places for people to eat,\" added Imani.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can make sure there are shelters for people to sleep when it's \ncold outside,\" said Billy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can find them and become friends with them,\" said Madi.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can love them,\" said my newest student, the one who is homeless.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy wonderful second-graders realized that we are responsible for each \nother, that love and care means making a way for children and \nfamilies living in shelters, cars and hotel rooms to have housing, \nfood, clothing, medical care and education.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, they will be adults who make the decisions and policies that \nform our communities. In the meantime, as we adults make those \ndecisions and policies, I hope we will hear the words of my student.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You can love them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTrevor Barton teaches second grade and is a member of First Baptist \nChurch in Greenville, S.C.

    "words": "He was indeed the \"prince of  preachers\" because he kept in \u0014\nmind the fact that his audience was God and humanity, in that \u0014\norder. He purposed early on not to try to conform to some precon- \u0014\nceived ideas about sermons and preaching and dared to be \u0014\ndifferent. In the years that followed, his popularity never waned, \u0014\nand his voice and life remained true to his call. Eventually, petty \u0014\npastors made their peace with Spurgeon as someone who was \u0014\nindeed authentic and unique.

Since no evidence was provided to \nindicate that the behavior at issue rose to a level of scientific \nmisconduct, no formal investigation is warranted.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 9/4/12\u0014",

    "title": "SOME PAKISTANI WOMEN RISK ALL TO MARRY WHOM THEYCHOOSE",
    "words": "September 8, 2012, New York Times \u0014\n                           Defying Parents, Some Pakistani Women Risk \nAll to Marry Whom They Choose\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MEGHAN DAVIDSON LADLY\u0014\n\u0014\nKARACHI, Pakistan  Nusrat Mochi, now 25, left her parents home one \nday to go to work and never returned. Instead of starting a job as a \ndomestic worker, she ran away to begin a new life, against her \nfamilys wishes, with a husband of her choosing rather than the one \nthey had chosen for her. Her parents wrath has trailed her ever \nsince. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the four years since she and her husband, Abbas Bhatti, now 27, \neloped, they have moved twice to escape threats to their lives, they \nsay. Even today, with two small children, they try to keep the \nlocation of their home a secret. If threats were not enough, Ms. \nMochis parents also brought a legal case charging that Mr. Bhatti \nhad kidnapped her. \u0014\n\u0014\nI dont care about my father and mother, Ms. Mochi said, sitting in \nher two-room house and cradling her youngest child in her lap. When \nthey are sending some person to kill me, how can I? \u0014\n\u0014\nTheir story illustrates the conflicts some women encounter in \nPakistan when choosing what are known here as freewill marriages. It \nalso shows how women are increasingly asserting their rights against \nthe traditions of forced marriage and parental authority, implicitly \nchallenging one of the most powerful institutions in Pakistani \nsociety. \u0014\n\u0014\nThough some form of arranged marriage remains the most common way for \nPakistanis to find spouses, marriage without the consent of a womans \nguardian was legalized in 2003. The change in the law has created a \nlarger opening for many women to claim their independence, using the \ncourts and the local news media. Ms. Mochis parents suit was \ndefeated in a Karachi court in April. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tactics have given more visibility to a problem long considered \nlargely a private matter. \u0014\n\u0014\nThings are changing; the girls are becoming bolder, they are \ncontinuously taking steps, and they are not afraid to die, said \nMahnaz Rahman, resident director of the Aurat Foundation, a womens \nrights organization active throughout Pakistan. They know that they \nwill be killed, but even then they are taking these steps because \nthey cant conform to the values of their parents. They are the girls \nof this modern age. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a woman disagrees with her parents choice of husband, she has \nfew options, Ms. Rahman said. If she wants to marry someone else, the \ntwo must elope and leave the family home behind. By leaving the home, \nthough, the daughter is considered to have dishonored her family, and \nthat is where culture, custom and the legal system intersect with \nretribution. \u0014\n\u0014\nParents frequently press kidnapping charges to regain control of a \nrenegade daughter. Such cases can engulf entire families, as the \npolice will often seize property and detain relatives of the accused \nman. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they met and fell in love, Ms. Mochi and Mr. Bhatti were \nneighbors in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, a section of Karachi. The complication \nwas evident from the start. Ms. Mochi had been promised since birth \nto her fathers cousin, 15 years her senior. Her family refused to \nend the engagement. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer parents have since moved back to their ancestral home, a village \nin the Rajanpur district of Punjab Province, and could not be reached \nfor comment. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple secretly married in a Karachi city court on Aug. 11, 2007, \nthen waited until Mr. Bhatti was able to save money and secure a home \nfor them in another part of the city before making their escape the \nfollowing year. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Mochis father soon began harassing Mr. Bhattis father for the \nreturn of his daughter or some monetary compensation. Eventually, the \nfamily charged Mr. Bhatti with kidnapping for ransom. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn court, Ms. Mochi was able to testify that she had not been coerced \nand could produce the affidavit she had signed on their wedding day \ndeclaring that the decision to marry was her own. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch affidavits have become crucial tools in conflicts over freewill \nmarriages. Not only are they produced in court to validate these \nunions, but they are also presented by women to local Sindhi-language \nnewspapers as freewill marriage notices, subverting the traditional \nconcept of the marriage announcement to fend off accusations of \nabduction and adultery. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sanction against freewill marriage has neither to do with law \nnor with religion, Ms. Rahman said. It has to do with culture. It \nhas to do with lack of education. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the cases Ms. Rahman sees come from rural, impoverished areas \nof Sindh Province, where tribal councils, or jirgas, hold more \ninfluence than state courts. For women who have married without the \nconsent of the family or who have refused the spouse picked for them, \ncommunity justice is often worse than a long court battle. \u0014\n\u0014\nPakistani newspapers routinely carry articles about couples who faced \nviolence as a result of marrying without their families consent. In \none recent case, The Express Tribune reported last month that a \ncouple, Almas Khan and Shamim Akhtar, were killed in Chakwal, Punjab, \nover the weekend of Id al-Fitr, the holiday ending Ramadan. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Akhtars father had registered a kidnapping case with the police \nafter the couple eloped. The family contacted their daughter and her \nhusband, saying the pair would be forgiven if they returned. When \nthey complied, they were shot and their bodies strung from a tree. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese killings, called karo-kari in Sindhi, are a constant threat for \nwomen who enter into freewill marriages. The women are considered \ndishonorable, or kari, and become the targets of male relatives \nlooking to restore family prestige. The men, too, can be targets. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven when such cases are investigated, the killers often escape \nprison sentences. Under Islamic criminal law, which applies to murder \ncases in Pakistan, victims heirs or family members are entitled to \npardon a perpetrator in exchange for monetary compensation. Since \nmost karo-kari killings are committed by close relatives, there is \noften pressure to forgive the perpetrator, who then goes free. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn its 2011 annual report, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, \nan independent organization, found that, according to news and field \nreports, at least 943 women were victims of so-called honor killings \nthat year, 219 of them because they wanted to choose a spouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch realities did not discourage Ms. Mochi from making her choice. \nShe was, she said, too consumed by anger on the day she left home. \nIf they are not allowing me to get married, than I will do it, she \nrecalled telling herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bhatti is trying to negotiate an end to the feud so the couple \ncan live in peace, but his wifes family is demanding 200,000 rupees, \nor $2,110. He earns 200 rupees a day. Still, he says, he and his wife \nare content. We are happy with our every decision, he said.\u0014",

He felt that she had put him down, exercised force which she \nshouldn't have, etc. So as soon as the mother was out of sight, the \nlamb ran to the pig pen and jumped the fence. He was soon feeling the \ncool mud on his feet, then on his legs and soon on his stomach. After \na few moments he decided he had better go back to his mother but \nfound that he couldn't. He was stuck! Mud and wool do not mix. His \npleasure had become his prison. He was hopelessly bound by his own \nfolly. He cried and was rescued by a kindly farmer. When cleaned and \nreturned to the fold, the lamb's mother said again, \"Remember sheep \ndon't wallow!\" -- Mike Hughes\u0014",

    "words": "Song of the Secularist\u0014\n\u0014\nJacques Berlinerblau offers a soaring paean to freedom from religion, \nbut the American people don't seem to be singing along. \u0014\n\u0014\nReview by David Aikman  9/20/2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jacques Berlinerblau's How to Be Secular: A Call to Arms for \nReligious Freedom (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) is the best show that \ncommitted secularists can put on in the contemporary US, the small \nband of devoted people who call themselves \"secular\" are going to be \ndisappointed. Apparently, they have a record of all but consistent \nrecent defeat at the hands of their religiously devout opponents, \nwhom the author calls \"revivalists.\" \"Over the past few decades, the \nChristian Right has pulverized secularism,\" the author writes. \n\"Simply pulverized it!\" Secularism, in Berlinerblau's frank \nadmission, is singularly unpopular. \"What the people don't want,\" he \nconfides early on, \"is, well, secularism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author, a professor and director of Jewish Studies at Georgetown \nUniversity, defines secularism as \"a political philosophy, which at \nits core is preoccupied with, and often deeply suspicious of any and \nall relations between government and religion.\" So far, so good: Many \nAmericans, including many devout Christians, don't want the \ngovernment fiddling around in any way with religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two major challenges to any traction that secularism might \notherwise gain with the American public. First is the reluctance of \nmost Americans to go whole hog down the separationist road. Americans \ndon't want a theocrat in the White House, but they don't appear to \nwant an atheist either. Second, as Berlinerblau admits, there are \nsome nasty edges to secularism. \"Secularism's zero-tolerance for \ndisorderly religious acts,\" he admits, \"unfolds into another \nunflattering truth. The secular vision is statist to the core. In a \ndispute between the state and religion, the state always trumps \nreligion.\" That's not a comforting thought for people worried that an \nAmerican version of the KGB may be hiding behind a bush in their \nfront yard waiting to whisk them off to the gulag for holding a Bible \nstudy. To underscore the big-brother component of secularism, the \nauthor adds, \"Thus, the revivalists [anyone the author deems to have \nan evangelical Christian conviction] are correct in tarring \nsecularism as a form of rule akin to apartheid, in which a minority \nsuppresses the will of the majority (that is, those who want the \ngovernment to espouse a religion).\" Woe betide the \"revivalist\" \nlegislator, according to Berlinerblau, who doesn't check his personal \nfaith beliefs at the door of the legislature.\u0014",

    "words": "In Max Lucado's book, And the Angels Were Silent, he tells the story \nof a man name John Blanchard. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust before being shipped out for duty in World War II, Blanchard \npicked up a book off the shelf of a Florida library. Flipping through \nthe book, he found himself intrigued, not with the book, but with the \nnotes penciled in the margins. The writing reflected a warm heart and \nquick mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous \nowner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith time and effort, Blanchard located Miss Maynell's address in New \nYork City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her \nto correspond with him as he served his country in Europe. She \naccepted and agreed to the arrangement. For the next 13 months, the \ntwo wrote to each other across the ocean. A romance budded. Blanchard \nrequested a photograph, but Maynell refused and said if he really \ncared for her, looks didn't matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day came for him to return from Europe. He and Miss Maynell \nagreed to meet at 7:00 P.M. at the Grand Central Station in New York. \n\"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll wear on my \nlapel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 7:00, he reached the station and started looking for the woman who \nhad touched him so deeply. As he scanned the area, a beautiful \nblonde-haired, blue-eyed-woman in a green suit approached. Blanchard \nstarted toward her, but then noticed she wore no rose. Moving past \nhim, she leaned close and asked, \"Going my way, sailor?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was all he could do not to follow her. But then, across the lobby, \nhe saw Bonis Maynen. She was a woman of at least 40 years. She had \ngray hair and a matronly figure. Blanchard stared back at the girl in \nthe green suit, his heart breaking to go after her. But he knew he \ncouldn't leave Miss Maynell alone in the station. After all, her \nletters had helped him get through the war. Though it wouldn't be \nlove, he felt grateful for her friendship. He stepped to her and \nstuck out his hand. \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard,\" he said. \"You \nmust be Miss Hollis Maynell. May I take you to dinner?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman smiled shyly, then said, \"I don't know what this is about, \nSon, but a blonde lady in a green suit begged me to wear this rose on \nmy coat. She said if a Mr. Blanchard introduced himself and asked me \nout to dinner, I should tell him that she is waiting for him in the \nbig restaurant across the street. She said this was some kind of a \ntest!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome kind of a test, indeed! Miss Maynell wanted to see if John \nBlanchard 's actions coincided with the words she had read in his \nletters. She wanted to test his character by his deeds.\u0014",

    "title": "STAND FIRM IN THE LORD",
    "words": "History records the expression, Athanasius contra mundum -- \nAthanasius against the world. These words aptly express the situation \nin the fourth-century church when heresy almost reigned supreme -- \nsave Athanasius, a bishop who was a persistent and staunch defender \nof the faith. Athanasius was born into a Christian family in \nAlexandria, Egypt, in 295 A.D. In his early twenties he was ordained \nand entered the service of Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria. He \naccompanied the bishop to the first ecumenical council of the church \nat Nicaea in 325 when, among other matters, the heresy of Arianism, \nwhich promoted the idea that Jesus was not God, was first condemned. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 326, Alexander died and two years later Athanasius was selected to \nbe the new bishop of Alexandria. It was at this time that his career \nas a persistent defender of the faith began. His first opponent was \nMelitius, a fellow bishop, who believed that it was wrong for the \nchurch to welcome back those who had apostatized. Athanasius \ntriumphed in this struggle through a righteous and dogmatic campaign. \nHis greatest nemesis, however, was the Arians, who although \ncondemned, continued to grow and attract many to their theological \nperspective. In fact, the number of Arians was so great that Saint \nJerome, the original translator of the scriptures into Latin (the \nVulgate), once wrote, \"The world awoke and found itself Arian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 335-366, Athanasius, one of the few bishops in the eastern \nchurch who held the orthodox faith, was exiled on five different \noccasions for a total of seventeen years. Trumped-up charges, false \ntestimony, and the events of the day combined to work against him, \nbut each time Athanasius returned from exile he was that much more \ndetermined to defend the true faith. During his exiles he wrote many \nimportant treatises, including The Life of Antony, a biography of \nAntony of the Desert, one of the first desert monks and a precursor \nto monastic life. Through tenacity, perseverance, and the fact that \nhe was able to outlive almost all his opponents, Athanasius, in the \nend, was able to prevail. He died in 373, living his last seven years \nin relative peace. His greatest triumph came, however, in 381 at the \nCouncil of Constantinople when the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, \nwhich contains the tenets of the faith Athanasius so staunchly \ndefended, was written and accepted. It was a testimony to Athanasius' \npersistence and dedication that he triumphed, became a saint, and \ninherited eternal life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAthanasius' life stands as an example of the scriptural exhortation \nto be persistent in what we do in order to receive the gift of \nsalvation. He stood against the tide that sought his demise. These \nwere, as Paul describes them, \"enemies of the cross of Christ.\" The \nbishop did as Paul suggests to the Philippians today, that is, to \nstand firm in the Lord. We are called to do the same.\u0014",

After \nhe and his wife signed their ticket, they scanned it for good measure \nand then immediately placed it in a safety deposit box at a local \nbank.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawyer Up - When the public finds out that youre a \nmulti-millionaire, things will start moving very, very quickly. Its \nimportant to have a team in place to help you handle your money and \nnotoriety before the chaos begins. After winning, Morrison says one \nof the first people he talked to was his accountant. Within hours \nhed called his lawyer and was assembling a team tax specialists and \nestate planners to help him understand how to make use of his \nwinnings. We did not come out until we knew that we were in the best \nfiscal and legal and tax shape that we could be in, he says. If you \ndont have any legal counsel you trust, he recommends reaching out to \npast winners to find out which lawyers they used.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtect Your Family - Ever heard of kidnap and ransom insurance? If \nyou win the lottery, advisers may suggest that you consider it for \nyour family, as they did Morrison. He opted out, but did hire a \nsecurity detail to protect his home and even drive his daughters to \nand from school in the week after his lotto win was announced. We \nwerent taking any chances, Morrison says. It was very scary for \ntwo of my girls that had children. Someone could just want to pull \nover and try to swipe a grandkid.\u0014\n\u0014\nClaim Your Prize at an Undisclosed Location - While youre getting \nall your financial ducks in a row, the vultures will already be \nswarming to figure out who got the payday, since many states announce \nboth the town and the establishment where the winning number was \npicked. Avoid the media circus by going to a lottery office far away \nfrom your hometown to claim your prize. Morrision and his lawyer  \nMichael Solomon of New Yorks Solomon & Herrera  drove two hours \nfrom Hauppauge N.Y. all the way to Fishkill to claim the prize, and \nthey used the lawyers wifes car to avoid being tailed. After that \nthere was no escaping the TV cameras, boxes of mail, and constant \nphone calls, so the Morrisons had only one recourse\u0014\n\u0014\nPlan an Escape Route - No doubt media insanity will commence when the \nPowerball winners are announced. The best way to deal with it is not \nto participate at all. After the Morrisons had given the press \nconference required under the terms of the lottery competition, they \ndrove straight from the lotto office to the airport and hopped on a \nplane to Hawaii for a two-week vacation. By the time they got back, \ntheir 15 minutes of fame had thankfully elapsed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf youre clutching a golden ticket right now, dazed and unsure of \nwhat to do, use your last days of anonymity to develop a coherent \nplan for your newfound wealth. Youll have an entirely new life the \nmoment your good fortune is thrust into the public eye. Its very \nsurreal to go from your everyday life to having to duck the press and \nto have TV trucks lining your street, Morrison says. Unless you \nhave a good team around you, it can be more of a nightmare than you \ncan ever imagine.\u0014",

Crystal Kelley, 29, \nwas carrying a child for a Connecticut couple struggling with \ninfertility, but approximately five months into the pregnancy, \ndoctors discovered the child had severe abnormalities, including \nheart defects, a cyst on the brain and a cleft lip and palate. The \nbaby would require several heart surgeries following birth, and would \nlikely survive, but would only have a 25 percent chance at a normal \nlife, doctors said. When the waiting couple found out, they demanded \nthat Kelley have an abortion -- but Kelley refused. After the couple \ncalled Hartford Hospital to inquire about abortion services and were \ninformed that only Kelley could request an abortion, theyoffered to \npay Kelley $10,000 to have the baby aborted. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple hired an attorney, but still Kelley refused. She hired her \nown attorney, who contended that she should not be forced to have an \nabortion. Shortly thereafter, the couple informed Kelley they had \nchanged their minds and planned to take custody of the child, then \nsurrender her as a ward of the state upon birth. Kelley's attorney \npresented her options, one of which was to move to a state where only \nthe woman carrying the child is recognized as the mother under the \nlaw -- so Kelley decided to move to Michigan, a state that also \nprovides the best pediatric heart care in the country, and give the \nbaby up for adoption. The couple continued to fight for their rights \nto the child, but it was admitted in court documents that the woman \nhad used an anonymous egg donor during the in vitro fertilization \nprocess, so when the baby girl was born, Kelley's name went on the \nbirth certificate. The girl still deals with numerous health issues \nand faces a number of risky heart surgeries, but according to her \nadoptive parents, she is in good spirits. Kelley, who is thankful she \nfought for the baby's life, is adamant that she made the right \ndecision. \"When I look into her pretty blue-ish eyes, I can see that \nsparkle that makes me know that I did the right thing by standing up \nfor her,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 2/7/13\u0014",

She saw him briefly before she died. The little boy \ndid not go home to be with Premila's husband and two children, but \nwith Helen, a woman from the United States who had paid Premila to \ncarry her baby.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust a few weeks earlier, over a thousand miles away in southeast \nIndia, another woman died just because she was carrying a baby nobody \nwanted. Munni was beaten to make her abort her child for the third \ntime. A local religious leader predicted she would not have a male \nchild until her seventh pregnancy, and this was only her sixth. She \nwas carrying a girl. Both she and her daughter were killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Rwanda, Christine's husband abandoned her after she gave birth. \nHer difficult labor caused a chronic illness called obstetric \nfistula, leaving Christine incontinent, smelly, and isolated. Her \nbaby was stillborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe discrimination against women and girls in healthcare extends \nbeyond the high-profile issues such as abortion, gendercide, and sex \ntrafficking. It isn't limited to poor countries or certain \nprocedures, but extends broadly across a healthcare system that too \noften reduces women to their reproductive capabilities, objectifies \ntheir bodies, and doesn't get them the care they need and deserve.\u0014\n\u0014\nRight here in the U.S., female veterans face traumatic experiences in \nVA hospitals and the callous treatment of sexual trauma in the \nmilitary. And, in the UK, a \"dearth of gender-biased clinical \nresearch\" fails to evaluate drug risks or to adequately recognize \nconditions that disproportionately affect women, such as coronary \nartery disease. Girls in India get subjected to medical testing \nwithout their consent.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommodification treats the body as a commodity, a medical resource \nfor meeting a personal need. In the most literal sense, body parts \ncan be sold, a kidney for an organ transplant or eggs to create an \nembryo via in vitro fertilization. As our sensibilities become numbed \nto the many ways women and girls have been commodifiedtheir bodies \nexploited and viewed in market termsScott Altman, in \"(Com)Modifying \nExperience,\" suggests that we, too, have been commodified.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjectification begins at home, where tabloids evaluate and critique \nour appearances (just ask puffy-faced Ashley Judd), and the \"beauty \nculture\" blasphemes our bodies. Exploitation takes harmful views of \nthe female body much further, allowing others to profit from the sale \nof body parts or services. Premila, who sold the use of her womb for \nnine months, was exploited because of her extreme poverty. Guna \nPonraj, who sold a kidney on the black market in India, was swindled \nout of payment, maimed by the removal, and subsequently left unable \nto work.\u0014",

The first, \nverses 57-61, is an expression of kindness and love shown to the body \nof Jesus by Joseph, a relatively rich man from Arimathea. The second, \nverses 62-66, depicts the chief priests and the Pharisees as gaining \npermission from Pilate to have guards stationed at the tomb of Jesus \nto make certain that Jesus body will remain there. The materials in \nverses 57-61 are edifying and appropriate for consideration on this \nSaturday, when we are experiencing with the early disciples of Jesus \nthe sadness of facing the reality of Jesus death. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing that is edifying or appropriate for our use in the \nsecond account. It and its sequel in Matthew 28:4, 11-15 are \nmalicious polemic against the Pharisees, developed and included only \nby the Matthean reactors. Matthew 27:62-66 and 28:4, 11-15 provide \nfor us in narrative form information about the animosity that \ndeveloped between some of the Matthean redactors and Pharisees with \nwhom some of the Matthean redactors were having many experiences of \nfrustration over not being able to convert Pharisees to the \ntheological position of the Matthean redactors.

We can read them and express in our sermon or \nhomily that we regret that that are in the text and that they are in \nthe lectionary.

And they somehow seemed more poignant \ncoming on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the American-led \ninvasion. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy midmorning, the familiar sight of black smoke rose above a \ncityscape of palm fronds, turquoise-tiled mosque domes and squat \nconcrete buildings. By midafternoon, the numbers had stacked up: 57 \ndead and nearly 190 wounded in separate attacks that included 17 car \nbombs, 2 adhesive bombs stuck to cars, and a killing with a silenced \ngun. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost attacks hit Shiite neighborhoods. Their targets varied: \nrestaurants, a bank, a vegetable market and a parking garage. Others \nwere near a courthouse and a university, and some seemed to have no \ntarget other than innocent passers-by. Many Iraqis say they worry \nabout an increase in sectarian tensions. Though there were no \nimmediate claims of responsibility, the attacks were carried out in \nthe fashion of \\Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Sunni insurgent group \nweakened but not vanquished by the American military. \u0014\nHarder to measure was the number of lives interrupted. \u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of hours after a car bomb struck outside his apartment \nbuilding in the Shiite neighborhood called New Baghdad, Shwan Jameel \nrummaged through the clothes and blankets, sprinkled with shards of \nglass, until he found a blue nylon bag filled with memories. \u0014\n\u0014\nInside were business cards of former bosses, badges he used to enter \nthe Green Zone when he was a security guard for the American \noccupiers, and letters in support of a visa application to emigrate \nto the United States that he said had never been answered. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is with great pleasure that I am able to detail his \naccomplishments and record his service, one American official wrote \nin a letter from 2004 in which he described how Mr. Jameel had saved \nAmerican lives after an ambush in Mosul during the height of the war. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us are here thanks, in no small part, to Shwan and his \nbravery, the official wrote. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Jameel's family was unharmed by the morning's blast, which killed \nor injured several other people, and he was able to conjure his sense \nof humor. I'm just smiling because it's too crazy, he said. Life \nis funny here. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the apartment next to Mr. Jameel's, Layla Alwain, a mother of six \nin a black abaya, wailed: Too much hurt, too much pain. Where should \nwe go? \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty, hunger, pain, she said, ticking off the features of her \nlife. We've got nothing, and it's getting worse and worse. Our \ncountry is not developing like others. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe added: This explosion didn't happen at the president's house. It \nhappened in front of the poor people's house. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer husband, Abbas Rydah, a day laborer, echoed the feeling of many \nIraqis who link the bickering among political factions and violence \nin the streets. And he suggested that forbearance could help end the \ndeep-seated grudges at the root of the violence. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe just need to forgive our brothers, he said. Then he broke down \ncrying. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the situation we live in? he said. It just hurts. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith violence so familiar, though, attacks can seem to barely disturb \nthe broader contours of life for those not directly affected. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the traffic snarl outside the checkpoint entrance to New Baghdad, \ncampaign posters for coming elections hang like taunts of the \ndemocracy that cannot seem to take hold here. A man sold \nred-and-yellow squeaky alligator toys, just as a minivan passed from \nthe direction of the bombing, a wooden coffin fastened to its roof. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Shula, another Shiite neighborhood, a white truck arrived in the \nearly morning at a produce market, with a load of pea pods hiding \nexplosives. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe result was a tangle of charred steel rods, rotting peas covered \nin a thick swarm of flies and angry Shiite men determined that Iraq \nnot slide back into widespread sectarian violence. \u0014\n\u0014\nI don't think it will get as bad as before, said Ali Minghash, 30, \nwho works at the market. In each house now you have pain, and we \ndon't want more pain. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuraid Adnan contributed reporting.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTHIS WILD, CONTINUING TURMOIL DIDN'T HAPPEN WHEN SADDHAM HUSSEIN WAS \nIN POWER.\u0014\n UNDISCIPLINED FREEDOM CAN BE COSTLY\u0014",

    "words": "From The American Patriot's Almanac: STARS AND STRIPES NAILED TO THE \nPOLE an exuberant Robert Peary telegraphed from Labrador, Canada, \nannouncing he had reached a goal long sought by explorersthe North \nPole. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeary, a 52-year-old U.S. Navy commander, had made several arctic \nexpeditions and two failed attempts to reach the Pole. He had spent \nyears learning from the native Inuit the best ways to dress in furs, \nbuild igloos and drive sledges across the ice. On one trip, he had \nlost eight toes to frostbite; but he was determined and endeavored \n\"to hurl myself, time after time, against the frigid No of the Great \nNorth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 1, 1909, Peary set out from his base camp on Ellesmere \nIsland, 413 miles from the Pole. His team counted 24 men, 19 sledges \nand 133 dogs. With him was his longtime assistant, Matthew Henson, an \nexpert explorer in his own right. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor weeks the men battled roaring winds and temperatures of -50F. \nThey hacked trails across rough patches, floundered in snowdrifts, \nand hauled their sledges across ridges of ice. At times channels of \nwater suddenly opened before them. They waited for the water to \nrefreeze, then scampered across the thin ice. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeary, Henson, and four Inuit made the final, 133-mile part of the \ntrek. On April 6, Peary calculated they had reached their goal. \"The \npole at last!\" he wrote in his diary. \"The prize of three centuries.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the decades, some critics have questioned whether Peary \nactually made it as far as the North Pole. For years, Henson, who was \nblack, received scant recognition for his role. Today the two men \ngenerally are credited as the first to reach the Pole. Both are \nburied in Arlington National Cemetery. Peary's gravesite is inscribed \nwith his motto: \"I shall find a way or make one.\"\u0014",

It is a sacred word \nlong associated with the killing of scores of unarmed Lakota men, \nwomen and children by soldiers of the United States Armys Seventh \nCavalry in the winter of 1890. \u0014\n\u0014\nWounded Knee was the so-called final battle of Americas war on its \nNative peoples. But what happened was hardly a battle. It was a \nmassacre. \u0014\n\u0014\nA band of several hundred Lakota led by Big Foot, a chief of the \nMnicoujou Sioux, was intercepted and detained by troops as they made \ntheir way from the Cheyenne River Reservation to Pine Ridge for \nsupplies and safety. After a night of drinking, the bluecoats were \ndisarming warriors the next morning when a shot went off. Soldiers \nopened fire with their Hotchkiss machine guns. At least 150 but \nperhaps as many as 300 or more Lakota died. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur fight to survive as a people continues today, a struggle to \npreserve not just our culture and our language but also our history \nand our land. Though I now live on the western reaches of the \nCheyenne River Indian Reservation, I grew up in Pine Ridge, among my \nOglala kin just a few miles from Wounded Knee. One member of my \nfamily survived the killing; others died. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe killing ground stirs great emotion in all of our people  \nmemories of bodies frozen into twisted shapes, of those who were \nhunted down and murdered as they fled, and of those who escaped in \nbitter cold across wind-swept plains. These stories have been handed \ndown to us and live within us. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne story I remember vividly was told to me when I was about 8 by a \ntribal elder, a very old woman whose mother had survived the \nbloodshed as a child. The old womans mother told her how her own \nmother had gathered her up when the bullets started flying. Just \nthen, a young horse warrior galloped past and took the child up in \nhis arms to help her escape. As she looked back, she saw her mother \nshot down, her chest torn open by bullets. She told her daughter that \nshe remembered tasting the salt in her tears. The old woman told me \nall this after I had knocked over a saltshaker. Salt still reminded \nher of her mother. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many such stories. The spiritual power of the place \nexplains why members of the American Indian Movement took it over in \n1973 to call the nations attention to the economic and cultural \ninjustices against our Native brothers and sisters. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, our heritage is in danger of becoming a real-estate transaction, \nanother parcel of what once was our land auctioned off to the highest \nbidder. The cries of our murdered people still echo off the barren \nhills  the cries we remember in our hearts every day of our lives. \nBut they may finally be drowned out by bulldozers and the ka-ching of \ncommerce. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wounded Knee site passed from the Oglala into private hands \nthrough the process known as allotment, begun in the late 1800s, by \nwhich the federal government divided land among the Indians and gave \nother parcels to non-Indians. The idea was to shift control of our \nland from the collective to the individual and to teach the Lakota \nand other Native Americans the foreign notion of ownership. But to \nus, the policy was just another form of theft. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe private owner of the Wounded Knee site, who has held title to the \n40-acre plot since 1968, wants to sell it for $3.9 million. If the \nOglala of Pine Ridge dont buy it by May 1, it will be sold at \nauction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is one of the poorest places in the \nUnited States, and the Oglala, who are deeply in debt, would be \nhard-pressed to meet the price. Many elders properly ask why any \nprice should be paid at all. The federal government should buy this \nland and President Obama should then preserve it as a national \nmonument  just as he did last month at five federally owned sites \naround the country, including one in Maryland honoring Harriet Tubman \nand the Underground Railroad. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe massacre site has great meaning not just for the Lakota but for \nall First Nations  and every American. Wounded Knee should remain a \nsacred site where the voices of the Ghost Dancers, who more than a \ncentury ago danced for the return of our old way of life, still echo \namong the pines, where the spirits of our elders still walk the \nhills, and where takini still has meaning: the survival of our \ncollective memory. \u0014\n\u0014\nChief Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman of the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe, teaches Lakota culture at the Takini School on the \nCheyenne River Indian Reservation.\u0014",

    "title": "SIX CRITICAL ISSUES TO PREVENT MEMBERS FROM DRIPPING OUT",
    "words": "Six Critical Issues to Prevent Church Members from Dropping Out\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 13, 2013\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGary McIntosh and Charles Arn recently released a delightful new \nbook, What Every Pastor Should Know. I love the data and research in \nthe book. One of my favorite sections dealt with retention of \nmembers. Two of the most critical findings were:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOf all the members who drop out of church, 82 percent leave in the \nfirst year of their membership. Retention efforts are thus critical \nin the first twelve months after a member joins a church. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe pattern of dropout is not random. Most leave close to their \nsix-month tenure or close to their twelve-month tenure. So church \nmembers seem to give new churches a test at both six months and \ntwelve months. If the church passes the test at six months, the \nmember will stay for another six months. If the church passes the \ntest at the one-year mark, the member is likely assimilated into the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first test consists of three questions. Though the church \nmember may not ask these questions specifically, he or she is \nevaluating three critical issues to determine if its time to move or \nstay. These are the issues around the six-month point.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave I made friends in this church? New members who remained active \nin the church made an average of seven new friends in these first six \nmonths. The drop-outs had an average of less than two friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs there a place in the church where I fit? Critically important to \nthis question is whether or not the new member is in a group or class.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes this church really want me? Are the members still as friendly as \nthey were when I first joined? Am I being invited or encouraged to \nparticipate in ministries in the church?\u0014\n\u0014\nAssuming the new member feels good about these first three questions, \nhe or she is likely to stay another six months or so. At roughly the \ntwelve-month point, the new member then evaluates the church on three \nmore issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre my new friends as good as my old friends? The members begin to \nassess the quality of their relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes the group meet my needs? By the time the new member has been \ninvolved in a group for more than six months, he or she is asking if \nthe investment of time in the group is really worth it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs my contribution important? Everyone wants to be a part of \nsomething significant, something greater than themselves. Church \nmembers join a church with those expectations. Near the end of the \nfirst year, they begin to evaluate that issue and their contributions \nto the overall mission of church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough there are no great surprises in these six issues, what is new \nin the study by McIntosh and Arn is the timing issue. Most of those \nwho will drop out will do so before the end of their first year. And \nat six months and twelve months respectively, new members will \nintuitively ask themselves six questions. How they respond to those \nquestions ultimately determines if they will stay or leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you evaluate these six questions? What can your church do to \nprevent members from dropping out?\u0014",

    "words": "I am reminded of an American tourist who was traveling in the Mid \nEast. He came upon several shepherds whose flocks had intermingled \nwhile drinking water from a brook. After an exchange of greetings, \none of the shepherds turned toward the sheep and called out, \"Manah. \nManah. Manah.\" (Manah means \"follow me\" in Arabic.) Immediately his \nsheep separated themselves from the rest and followed him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThen one of the two remaining shepherds called out, \"Manah. Manah.\" \nand his sheep left the common flock to follow him. The traveler then \nsaid to the third shepherd, \"I would like to try that. Let me put on \nyour cloak and turban and see if I can get the rest of the sheep to \nfollow me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe shepherd smiled knowingly as the traveler wrapped himself in the \ncloak, put the turban on his head and called out, \"Manah. Manah.\" The \nsheep did not respond to the stranger's voice. Not one of them moved \ntoward him. \"Will the sheep ever follow someone other than you?\" The \ntraveler asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh yes,\" the shepherd replied, \"sometimes a sheep gets sick, and \nthen it will follow anyone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have seen it, haven't we? People, young and old, who are \"sick.\" \nBattered by the storms of life and distracted by voices urging them \nto go this way and that, they have lost their bearings and they don't \nknow where they are or where they are going. That can be more than a \nlittle frightening; it leads to despair, to hopelessness. And when \nsomeone is \"sick\" they will follow anyone who will promise a moment \nof happiness, a brief feeling of peace or forgetfulness, a sense that \nthey are someone.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe call of Jesus the Good Shepherd is, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and \nthe Life.\" There is no better way, no greater truth, no happier life. \nOur Lord reaches out to us in love that we might follow him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn M.Braatan\u0014",

But charges could be filed once authorities \npinpoint how the boy died. An official cause of death is pending an \nautopsy, according to police.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe child was taken to a funeral home by an as yet unknown individual \nand the undertaker alerted police, Russell said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2010, a jury convicted the Schaibles, who have seven other \nchildren, of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment in \nKent's death from pneumonia. The Schaibles were sentenced to \nprobation over prison time. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs part of their sentence, the Schaibles were required to arrange \nmedical examinations for each of their children, to immediately \nconsult with a doctor when a child became sick and to follow the \ndoctors treatment recommendations.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring their trial, the Schaibles' lawyers said the parents were \ntargeted because their fundamentalist Christian beliefs espouse faith \nhealing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPennsylvania law says parents have a legal duty to protect their \nchildren's health and safety, although the law does not specify if or \nwhen medical care must be sought.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors said Kent could have been saved with basic medical care \n-- probably even over-the-counter medication -- but the couple relied \non prayer instead. Defense attorneys argued that their clients did \nnot know how sick the child was, and their beliefs played no role in \ntheir decision.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked for comment outside his Rhawnhurst home Friday, Herbert \nSchaible, 44, told NBC10s Chris Cato, We dont want to talk.\u0014",

    "words": "Self-Esteem, Therapeutic Culture\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a column for ChristianPost.com, Michael Craven writes: \n\"Christopher Lasch points out in his important book, The Culture of \nNarcissism, 'The contemporary climate is therapeutic not religious. \nPeople today hunger not for personal salvation, but for the feeling, \nthe momentary illusion, of personal well-being, health and psychic \nsecurity.' Following the eclipse of the Christian worldview that once \nshaped American life and culture, the therapeutic revolution of the \n60s emerged to convince us that personal happiness was the ultimate \ngoal of human life. This idea has only further encouraged the \nindividual self to elevate his or her needs and interests above \neveryone else's. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"By replacing the former religious culture with today's therapeutic \nculture we have unwittingly created the most narcissistic generation \nin American history. 'For a multi-university study released this \nyear, 16,475 college students took the standardized narcissistic \npersonality inventoryStudents' scores have risen steadily since the \ntest was first offered in 1982. The average college student in 2006 \nwas 30 percent more narcissistic than the average student in 1982.' \n(WSJ) \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What precisely is this narcissism I speak of, and how does the \ntherapeutic sensibility contribute to its formation? In short, the \nadvent of Freudian psychotherapy sought to liberate men from what it \nsaw as outdated modes of thinking about such things as love, duty, \nself-sacrifice and submission to higher authority. Under the Freudian \npremise, mental health, which becomes the highest human goal, was \ndefined as the overthrow of inhibitions and the immediate \ngratification of every impulse. Each person's own desires and wants \nwere given primacy over and above everything and everyone else, \nincluding God. Doing so, we were told, would make us happy and nearly \nevery aspect of contemporary American culture has combined to \nreinforce this message. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"By contrast, the Bible defines love as subordinating your needs to \nthose of others; that we have a God-given duty to serve and assist \nothers, that self-sacrifice is the ultimate demonstration of this \nlove, and that we are to submit to authority in the same way we \nsubmit to God. Furthermore, happiness is NOT the central aim of human \nexistenceknowing and glorifying God is, and from this flows \nsomething much deeper than temporal happiness: joy, which endures \nbeyond circumstances, producing true contentment.\"\u0014",

Both teens are also \nathletically inclined and have double jointed thumbs they can contort \nonto the palms of their hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Robin, a senior at Friendship\\ Academy in northeast Washington, \nD.C., grew up in foster care, moving from one home to another until \nstability finally came her way.\u0014\n\u0014\nI only grew up with my one brother, that's all Id known, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few miles away, Jordan, a junior at Woodrow Wilson High in the \nNorthwest section of the city, was raised as an adopted only child, \nsomething her mom never hid.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer telling me I was adopted really wasn't that big of a deal, \nJordan said. I just wanted to know more about it, I was really \ncurious ... She told me that there was a possibility that I did have \na sister, but you know, the information wasn't crystal clear.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhats clear is that these two young women met under remarkable \ncircumstances in perhaps the most unlikely of places.\u0014\n\u0014\n'She looked just like you!'\u0014\n\u0014\nIn January, at an indoor high school track meet, one of Jordans \nteammates was watching a girls race, cheering enthusiastically.\u0014\n\u0014\nI said, Go Jordan, Go Jordan!\" William Carson recalled.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is, until he realized he was rooting for an opponent. When she \ncrossed the finish line, William realized it wasnt Jordan after all.\u0014\n\u0014\nJordan was up like 10 feet away from me [in the bleachers]. She was \nlooking at me, like, Who is he talking to? And I was like, She \nlooked just like you!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe momentary confusion was soon cleared up by another student, \nLaniyyah Elam, whod attended elementary school with Robin but was \nnow a schoolmate of Jordans at Woodrow Wilson High School.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know that girl and started to cry. She knew her birth name was \nalso Jeter.\u0014\n\u0014\nI escorted her off to the bathroom, Laniyyah said. I asked her \nwhat was going on, and she told me that that was her sister, because \nshe knew the last name. And I was, like, Oh, wow. Do you want me to \nintroduce you to her? Later on, after the meet was over, I told \nRobin to come up and they met each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeparated by a few miles and 17 long years, the sisters awkwardly \nbegan what quickly developed into a comfortable, familiar, strong \nrelationship -- with nary a trace of a sibling rivalry forming.\u0014\n\u0014\nI couldn't even say anything, Robin said of the initial \nface-to-face conversation at the track meet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only thing I could say was, You know, we look a lot alike, \nJordan countered.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter several months of getting to know one anotherspending many \nweekends together and, soon, prom nightthe sisters look as though \nthey were never apart. They often finish one anothers sentences. \nRobin lovingly shoos away a fly from her sisters hair. And in those \nmoments, when theyre in each others company, physical contact seems \nirresistible, as if to suggest they fear ever losing grip on their \nsuddenly discovered treasure.\u0014",

There are \nnow almost 16.4 million suburban residents living below the poverty \nline, nearly 3 million more than in the cities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poverty line for a family of four was $23,021 in 2011, the latest \nCensus figures available.\u0014\n\u0014\nLow-income Americans have been moving to suburbs for many years, as \nwealthier Americans and companies relocated there. The poor were \nchasing the unskilled job opportunities that cropped up to cater to \nthese people and businesses, said Elizabeth Kneebone, who co-authored \nthe book.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When people think of poverty in America, they tend to think of inner \ncity neighborhoods or isolated rural communities,\" Kneebone said. \n\"But today, suburbs are home to the largest and fastest growing poor \npopulation in the country.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 2000s, many poor people found work in the suburbs in \nconstruction, fueled by the housing boom in the first part of the \ndecade, and in the services sector, working in restaurants and retail \nshops. Also, more impoverished immigrants increasingly moved directly \nto the suburbs over the past decade, joining predecessors who \nestablished communities outside of cities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Recession exacerbated the suburban poverty problem, as the \nconstruction industry cratered and many businesses closed, leaving \nlow-wage workers without jobs. Also, the downturn forced formerly \nmiddle class families down the economic ladder into poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suburbs, however, are ill-equipped to deal with this burgeoning \npoor population, Kneebone said. There aren't as many social services \nagencies and they are often spread far and wide, making it difficult \nfor those without cars to access. Most of the $82 billion spent by \nthe federal government to combat poverty is directed to cities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the book, Kneebone and her co-author, Alan Berube, argue that the \nfederal government needs to come up with new ways to tackle the \nproblem of poverty in suburbia, which requires different tactics than \nits urban counterpart. In particular, assistance must address the \nfragmented nature of suburban populations and assistance \norganizations.\u0014",

Rather, it induces a very shallow  involvement and as \nsuch, I think it's grossly over-promoted and there's a great deal of \nhyperbole surrounding it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think it's grossly oversold and within two or three years people \nwill shrug and say, '\"Uh yep, it was a fad of the early 90's and now, \noh yeah, it still exists but hey, I've got a life to lead and work to \ndo. I don't have time to waste online.\" Or, \"I'll collect my email, \nI'll read it, why should I bother prowling around the Worldwide Web \n\" simply because there's so little of value there.\u0014\n\u0014\nTen years later, in a 2006 TED talk, Stoll reflected on his failed \npredictions and said, \"If you really want to know about the future, \ndon't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist. No! Don't ask \nsomebody who's writing code. No, if you want to know what society's \ngoing to be like in 20 years, ask a kindergarten teacher.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SEVEN CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EFFECTIVE CRITIC",
    "words": "Seven Characteristics of an Effective Critic\u0014\nDecember 10, 2012 Tom Ranier\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days ago I had a long conversation with a critic of me. \nActually, it would be better to say that he is a critic of a decision \nI made. He would not want to descryibe himself as a critic of me in \nthe general sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nRare is the person who actually enjoys criticisms. I certainly would \nnot be among that unique group. But this man made the criticism \ntolerable. And he certainly gained my respect by the way he handled \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately after the conversation, I began to think through how he \nhad approached me. I thought about his words, his body language, and \neven his preparation for criticizing me. I realized I had a case \nstudy on effective criticism. I also was able to note seven of the \ncharacteristics of this conversation where he criticized me.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had no pattern of having a critical spirit. Some people are \nperpetually critical. Their negativity is known and often avoided. \nSuch people have little credibility. Even if they have something \nworthy to say, it is often ignored because of their patterns in the \npast. That was not the case with this man. He was not known as a \nnegative person. He did not speak or write in a critical way on an \nongoing basis. Because of this pattern, I was inclined to listen to \nhim. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe prayed before he criticized. In fact, this man prayed every day \nfor two weeks before he ever approached me. He asked God to stop him \nif his mission was not meant to be. He did not take the moment \nlightly. To the contrary, he treated it with utmost seriousness. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe communicated concern without anger. This critic did not once raise \nhis voice. His body language did not communicate anger. He was \npassionate in his position while maintaining his composure. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe avoided any ad hominem attacks. My critic wanted to be certain \nthat I knew he was not attacking me personally. He affirmed me in \nmany ways. He voiced respect for my character. But he did not waver \nin his expressed concern. Never once did I feel like I was under \nattack personally. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe asked for my perspective. Frankly, most of my critics through the \nyears have not expressed any desire to hear my side of the story. \nThey are so intent to communicate their position that they leave no \nroom for me to speak. Such was not the case with this critic. He \nasked a surprising question early in the conversation: Thom, why did \nyou make this decision? I really want to hear your thoughts straight \nfrom you. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe listened to me. Undoubtedly youve been in those conversations \nwhere the other person really does not indicate any desire to listen \nto you. Even while you are speaking, it is evident that he or she is \nformulating the next response rather than hearing your words. This \ncritic not only asked for my perspective, he really listened as I \nspoke. The only time he interjected was to ask clarifying questions. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was humble. One of the primary reasons we get defensive when we \nare criticized is the attitude of the critic. They often seem to have \nan all-knowing and condescending spirit. To the contrary, my critic \nwas genuinely humble. He was not a know-it-all. He did not act like \nthe smartest man in the room. Frankly his humility was humbling to \nme. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou cant be a leader without being criticized. Leaders have to make \ndecisions, and its rare that everyone will agree with your \ndecisions. While dealing with critics is not the most pleasant part \nof leadership, it is a necessary part. Sometimes leaders must \ndiscount the message because of the lack of credibility of the \nmessenger. But, in my case, I heard from a critic who truly made me \npause and consider his position. Not only did I hear his position, \nthough, I learned even more about being an effective critic and \nrecipient of criticism.\u0014",

    "words": "Witnesses said that as the Titanic was sinking, its band played the \nhymn \"Nearer, My God, To Thee.\" Others (scholarly research) \ndisagreed, but the words were popular in the late nineteenth and \nearly twentieth centuries: \u0014\n\u0014\nNearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!\u0014\nE'en though it be a cross, that raiseth me;\u0014\nStill all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir author, Sarah Flower, was born on this day, February 22, 1805 \nin Essex, England. She was the second daughter of Benjamin and Eliza \nFlowers. The home must have been opinionated, for her father was the \nradical editor (and owner) of The Cambridge Intelligencer and later \nof The Political Review. Mr. Flower went to prison once for \ncriticizing the politics of the Bishop of Llandaff, but he also \nworked with the literary giants of the day. For example, he published \nThe Fall of Robespierre: An Historic Drama by Samuel Taylor \nColeridge, better known to us as the poet who penned \"The Rime of the \nAncient Mariner\" and \"Kubla Khan.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Flowers entertained famous individuals in their house. One was \nthe poet Robert Browning.\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah married William Bridges Adams and they moved to London. An \nearly feminist, she made an agreement with him that she should do \"no \nhousekeeping.\" In London, she attended the independent church \n(Unitarian) of William Johnson Fox. She contributed thirteen hymns to \nhis Hymns and Anthems. One of them was \"Nearer, My God to Thee.\" It \nbecame a favorite at nineteenth century funerals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf \"Nearer, my God, to Thee\" was played on the Titanic, that was why. \nBandleader Wallace Hartley had always said he wanted it played at his \nfuneral.\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah aspired to create great works of literature. Close friends with \nthe poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, she delighted in the \"Romantic\" style. \nShe published several dramatic poems. The best of them was called \nVivia Perpetua. Its five acts dealt with early martyrs in the clash \nbetween Christianity and heathenism. The only line that is commonly \nquoted is from Act III: \"Once have a priest for enemy, good bye to \npeace.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe school of poetry to which she belonged, focusing on spontaneous \nemotion and morbid thoughts, became known as the Spasmodics. Its \nmajor works did not endure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe drama-writing Sarah had an older sister Eliza, a talented \nmusician, whom she dearly loved. Both were in poor health; neither \nwould live to see fifty. Eliza died in 1846, weakened from nursing \nSarah through a long illness, and Sarah died twenty months later, \nnever having recovered from nursing Eliza in her last illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nOsbeck, Kenneth W. 101 Hymn Stories.

    "title": "SEX IN LEVITICUS",
    "words": "Sex in Leviticus\u0014\nIt's part of a much broader teaching in Scripture. \u0014\nChristopher J.H. Wright \u0014\n\u0014\nThe law in Leviticus prohibiting sexual intercourse between men \n(18:22) comes in the same book that contains laws prohibiting foods \nthat Israelites were to consider unclean (chapter 11). We eat \nshellfish today without any moral problems, so why should we treat \nthis sex law as morally binding? Haven't we outgrown all of that \nLevitical law anyway? Christians who insist on the sexual laws of the \nBible are being inconsistent in not keeping all the other laws too. \nSo goes one line of argument in modern debates about homosexuality. \nTo this, three things must be said.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, as I note in \"Learning to Love Leviticus,\" we no longer keep \nthe food laws because the separation they symbolized (between \nIsraelites and Gentiles in the Old Testament) is no longer relevant \nin Christ. But the ethical principles embodied in Old Testament laws \non sexual relations (positive and negative) remain constant and are \nreaffirmed by Jesus and Paul in the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the argument would reduce the Bible to absurdity. The Ten \nCommandments come in the same book that commanded Israel not to climb \nthe mountain. If we are told that we cannot with consistency \ndisapprove of same-sex activity unless we also stop eating shellfish, \nthen we should not condemn theft and murder unless we also ban \nmountaineering.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, and most important, the biblical discussion of homosexual \nbehaviour begins not in Leviticus, as if the whole argument depends \non how we interpret a single Old Testament law. When Jesus was asked \nabout divorce, he would not let the argument get stuck around the \ninterpretation of the law. Instead he took the issue back to Genesis. \nThat is where we find the foundational biblical teaching about God's \npurpose in creating human sexual complementarityand it is very rich. \nIt reflects Godmale and female together being made in God's \nimageand it provides the necessary togetherness and equality in the \ntask of procreating and ruling the earth. This God-given \ncomplementarity is so important that God explains how it is to be \njoyfully celebrated and exercisedthe union of marriage that is \nheterosexual, monogamous, nonincestuous, socially visible and \naffirmed, physical, and permanent (Gen. 2:24, endorsed by Jesus).\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that foundation, the rest of the Biblein the laws and narratives, \nin the prophets and wisdom literature, in the Gospels and \nEpistlesconsistently teaches that any other kind of sexual \nintercourse falls short of God's best will and plan for human \nflourishing. (And we should note that the Bible has far more to say \nabout all forms of disordered heterosexual sexual activity, including \nnonmarital and extramarital, than its prohibition of same-sex \nintercourse).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe law in Leviticus, then, must not be isolated, stuck alongside \nshellfish, and mocked into irrelevance. It is one small piece of a \nmuch larger and consistent pattern of whole-Bible teaching about the \ngift and joy and purpose and disciplines of our sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\n(THIS IS ONE CONSERVATIVE VIEIW)\u0014",

Even if you've driven over, under, and through the \ninterchanges hundreds of times, you still have to pay attention or \nyou'll start veering off course.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago when the interchange first opened, a local radio station \nheld a contest to nickname the massive tangle of concrete and steel. \nThe name that stuck was \"Spaghetti Junction.\" When you look at it \nfrom the sky, the name is certainly fitting. (Here's one Google image \nfor \"Spaghetti Junction\" in Atlanta.) It's actually a very efficient \ntraffic hubunless you happen to be passing through between 4:00-6:00 \nP.M.

The good news is that everyone eventually makes it out. The \nbad news is that, few people come out with the same attitude they \nwent in with.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour heart is a hub like Spaghetti Junction.

    "title": "SHOULD COLLEGE ATHLETES GET PAID FOR THEIR PLAY?",
    "words": "Johnny Footballs Payday\u0014\nBy JOE NOCERA\u0014\n\u0014\nWelcome aboard, Time magazine. So glad you decided to join our little \nbandwagon! \u0014\n\u0014\nIm referring, as you may already know, to the cover story in the \ncurrent issue. Its Time to Pay College Athletes, reads the \nheadline, accompanied by the current poster boy for the issue, Texas \nA&M quarterback Johnny Manziel. Indeed it is. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow that I think about it, the bandwagon isnt so little anymore. \nOver the last year or so, more and more voices have joined the chorus \ncalling for more equitable treatment of college football and mens \nbasketball players  athletes who essentially hold down full-time \njobs, and are expected to be big revenue producers for their schools, \nbut whose sole compensation is a scholarship, often renewable at the \nwhim of the coach, that may or may not lead to an education and that \nusually doesnt even cover the full cost of college. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has been especially striking to me in recent weeks is the way \nthe Manziel case has become a tipping point. Last season, as a \nfreshman, Manziel  whose nickname is Johnny Football  won the \ncoveted Heisman Trophy after leading the Aggies to an 11-2 record, \nwhich included an exciting victory over Alabama, the eventual \nnational champion. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn early August, ESPN reported that Manziel had signed his name on \nsome sports memorabilia in return for a five-figure flat fee from \nan autograph broker. After much Sturm und Drang, not to mention an \nN.C.A.A. investigation, Manziel was handed a silly punishment: a \nhalf-game suspension, which he served last Saturday, when the Aggies \nplayed their opening game of the season against the Owls of Rice \nUniversity. The N.C.A.A. said that it found no evidence that he had \ntaken any money, but it imposed the penalty because one of its rules \nstates that players cant sign autographs for people who are going to \ntry to make money from their signature, even if they reap no reward \nthemselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is worth noting that as college athletes go, Manziel is not the \nmost sympathetic of characters. Unlike many college athletes, he \ndoesnt need money; his father inherited an oil fortune. Last spring, \nhe didnt go to class on the A&M campus but instead took all online \ncourses. He can come across in profiles as surly, entitled and \naggrieved. And his drinking is such that his coach, Kevin Sumlin, and \nhis parents had him see an alcohol counselor, according to ESPN The \nMagazine. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut none of that has seemed to matter. Instead of viewing this as a \ncase of a pampered player breaking the rules, many people saw it \ninstead as example of how ridiculous the rules are. As Time magazine \nput it, The real question is, Whats wrong with that?  referring \nto a college athletes getting paid for his autograph. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe case just seems so egregious, said Warren Zola, an assistant \ndean at Boston Colleges Carroll School of Management who advises \nathletes preparing to turn pro. Punished for signing your own name? \u0014\n\u0014\nCritics of the current system, like me, often complain that everyone \nin the business of college sports gets rich except the players. In \nthe case of Manziel, you can see that clearly. After Manziels great \nseason, his coach, Sumlin, got a $1.1 million raise; his salary, \naccording to Time, now tops $3 million. The magazine came up with \nestimates showing that A&Ms media exposure, thanks in part to \nManziels Heisman Trophy, is worth $37 million, and that the retail \nvalue of A&M merchandise is $72 million  a 20 percent jump from the \nprevious year. The general public now recognizes the fact that the \nmoney is preposterous, Zola told me. It is this influx of money, \nmuch of it generated by television contracts, that makes the \ncontinued amateur status of the players so untenable. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are, of course, voices missing from the new chorus: those of \nthe college sports insiders, who cling to the status quo. And why \nwouldnt they? But theirs is not necessarily the last word. In \nCongress, a bill was recently introduced that would give players more \nrights, a sure sign that the issue is catching on. In the courts, \nlawsuits aimed at making it possible for players to earn some money \nfrom their likenesses continue to move forward. If a large enough \nsegment of the public comes to see that, however much they love \nfootball or mens basketball, the current state of affairs is \ninherently unfair, public outcry may force the necessary change. \u0014\n\u0014\nTimes cover suggests we may be getting to that point.\u0014",

    "title": "STEVE JOBS: A PARADIGM FOR CHURCH LEADERSHIP",
    "words": "Steve Jobs: A Paradigm for Church LeadershipBy: Seth Vopat\u0014\n September 19, 2013    EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics and consumers who expect Apple's future CEOs to be Steve Jobs \nwill continually be disappointed, Vopat observes. \u0014\n\u0014\nLast Tuesday, another Apple product release came and went, leaving \ncritics and consumers wanting. With consumers less than wowed by this \nlatest release, many are wondering if Apple has lost its ability to \namaze. As a fan of Apple, and as a current owner of both a MacBook \nAir and iPhone 4, I can't help but wonder if the company will ever be \nthe same without Steve Jobs. \u0014\n\u0014\nI found myself agreeing with words from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who \nreminisced over the passing of his friend, Steve Jobs, in a recent \ninterview on \"CBS This Morning.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEllison stated, \"My eulogy began, you know, I guess we're all told \nthat no one's irreplaceable. I don't believe that. I just don't.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEllison's words suggest that while Apple can seek to carry on the \ninnovative legacy of Jobs, his creativity and passion are \nirreplaceable. \u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, critics and consumers who expect Apple's future CEOs to be \nJobs will continually be disappointed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the wake of yet another product launch that failed to earn high \npraise, Ellison's words seem almost prophetic not only for Apple, but \nfor the church, as well. \u0014\nServing in ministry for more than a decade, I have witnessed my fair \nshare of staff transitions. This transitional period is often \nchallenging for the exact reason Ellison states about Apple. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe often think the departed staff member is easily replaceable, and \nso we look for people who best match the vision we have lined out for \nthe position. \u0014\nThe problem with this approach to hiring is that it's often the exact \nopposite of what we teach congregation members about spiritual \nformation and God's calling in our lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe often teach that God is calling us to live out of a deeper \nhumanity and true self, using phrases such as, \"Be the person God has \nmade you to be!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn support of this mindset, we reference biblical texts like Jeremiah \n29:11 and cite quotes from books like Parker Palmer's \"Let Your Life \nSpeak.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYet we expect and look for the exact opposite in our hiring of \ncongregational staff. Our job descriptions and profiles often reflect \nwhat we either really liked about the last person in the position or \nwhat we thought was missing. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis means the new staff member or volunteer is always living in the \nshadow of his or her predecessor. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe belief that ministry can go on the same as it always has after \nsomeone has moved on by simply finding the right person to fill the \nhole denies the humanity of our leaders and volunteers. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn some ways, this approach treats people as objects, as \ninterchangeable, easily replaced parts in a well-oiled machine. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, perhaps it is time for a paradigm shift in how we say goodbye to \npastors, staff and volunteers. \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe we need rituals to help conclude one person's ministry at a \nchurch that names the gifts that the leader or volunteer brought with \nthem while acknowledging that the person who will fill their position \nwill not be exactly like them. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same way, we need rituals that help us welcome and celebrate \nthe gifts of the incoming leader or volunteer. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis welcoming ritual should provide the opportunity to begin \nlearning more about the gifts and abilities of the new leader or \nvolunteer and to be open to how this new person's ideas, approaches \nand gifts will shape the landscape of our shared ministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese transition rituals are needed because, too often, we forget \nthat people are not replaceable. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis means that things will not remain exactly the same as they were \nbefore because even those who have similar gifts express and use \nthose gifts in different ways. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring transitions, we need to remember that people are not \ninterchangeable parts. Things will change when someone new is hired \nor volunteers for a role, and this is perfectly OK. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSeth M. Vopat is the associate pastor of youth and family at \nLouisburg First Baptist Church in Louisburg, Kan., and a graduate of \nCentral Baptist Theological Seminary.

This article seems to cast \na shadow on the strict dietary regime that Mr. Jobs put himself on, \nand surmises that he would have been much better off if he had \nconsented to surgery early in the game. I'm not sure that this \nassumption can be made in retrospect about this type of cancer. I've \nknown a great number of patients who opted for the latter treatment \nFIRST, and died even quicker than Mr. Jobs did. Would it be fair to \nsay that they made a poor choice in retrospect? I'm not sure that \neither summary judgment could be made with any degree of accuracy. I \ndon't normally post on sermon illustrations, but this one seemed a \ntad reckless to me.\u0014",

George \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWASHINGTON (BP) -- A Sudanese business owner and women's rights \nactivist defied a police demand this fall that she cover her hair to \nsatisfy their application of Sudan's laws on personal dress. Amira \nOsman Hamed now faces the prospect of corporal punishment in the form \nof 40 lashes if convicted of the charges brought against her. Her \nhearing was postponed earlier this month while the government \nprepared a response to her challenge to relevant portions of its \ncriminal code.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHamed's case highlights how Sudan's women bear the brunt of a brutal \nlegal system rooted in a draconian interpretation of Islamic (Sharia) \nlaw and corresponding hudood (classes of crimes with set \npunishments). The same regime which openly harbored Osama bin Laden \nand other international terrorists nearly a generation ago continues \nto trample on the fundamental rights of its own people, including the \nright to freedom of religion or belief.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, the U.S. government continues to \ndesignate Sudan as a country of particular concern, marking it a \nworld-class violator of religious liberty.

    "words": "The Irony of Despair, New York Times, David Brooks\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to David Brooks in The New York Times, \"According to the \nWorld Health Organization, global suicide rates have increased by 60 \npercent in the past 45 years. The increase in this country is nothing \nlike that, but between 1999 and 2010, the suicide rate among \nAmericans between 35 and 64 rose by 28 percent. More people die by \nsuicide than by auto accidents. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you get inside the numbers, all sorts of correlations pop out. \nWhites are more likely to commit suicide than African Americans or \nHispanics. Economically stressed and socially isolated people are \nmore likely to commit suicide than those who are not. People in the \nWestern American states are more likely to kill themselves than \npeople in the Eastern ones. People in France are more likely to kill \nthemselves than people in the United Kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"People don't kill themselves in bundles. They kill themselves, for \nthe most part, one by one. People who attempt suicide are always \nsubject to sociological risk factors, but they need an idea or story \nto bring them to the edge of suicide and to justify their act. If you \nwant to prevent suicide, of course, you want to reduce unemployment \nand isolation, but you also want to attack the ideas and stories that \nseem to justify it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people commit suicide because their sense of their own identity \nhas dissolved. Some people do it because they hate themselves. Some \nfeel unable to ever participate in the world. The writer Anne Sexton \nwrote the following before her own suicide: \u0014\n\u0014\nNow listen, life is lovely, but I Cant Live It. ... To be alive, \nyes, alive, but not be able to live it. Ay, thats the rub. I am like \na stone that lives ... locked outside of all thats real. ... I wish, \nor think I wish, that I were dying of something, for then I could be \nbrave, but to be not dying and yet ... and yet to [be] behind a wall, \nwatching everyone fit in where I cant, to talk behind a gray foggy \nwall, to live but ... to do it all wrong. ... Im not a part. Im not \na member. Im frozen. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn her eloquent and affecting book Stay: A History of Suicide and \nthe Philosophies Against It, Jennifer Michael Hecht presents two big \ncounterideas that she hopes people contemplating potential suicides \nwill keep in their heads. Her first is that, Suicide is delayed \nhomicide. Suicides happen in clusters, with one persons suicide \ninfluencing the others. If a parent commits suicide, his or her \nchildren are three times as likely to do so at some point in their \nlives. In the month after Marilyn Monroes overdose, there was a 12 \npercent increase in suicides across America. People in the act of \ncommitting suicide may feel isolated, but, in fact, they are deeply \nconnected to those around. As Hecht put it, if you want your niece to \nmake it through her dark nights, you have to make it through yours. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer second argument is that you owe it to your future self to live. A \n1978 study tracked down 515 people who were stopped from jumping off \nthe Golden Gate Bridge. Decades later, Hecht writes, 94 percent of \nthose who had tried to commit suicide on the bridge were still alive \nor had died of natural causes. Suicide is an act of chronological \narrogance, the assumption that the impulse of the moment has a right \nto dictate the judgment of future decades.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nBefore the days of gas chambers, lethal injections, and electric \nchairs, the Israelites used what was available: stones. The Old \nTestament prescribed execution by stoning as the punishment for \nblasphemy, idolatry, profaning the Sabbath, human sacrifice, \noccultism, and other offenses. Some genuine offenders were executed, \nbut Jesus lamented that Israel had also stoned true prophets (Matt. \n23:37). John 8:111 [although this account is highly questioned by \nNew Testament scholars because it is found in none of the early \nmanuscripts of John] records the story of a woman about to be stoned \nfor adultery; Jesus uttered His famous words, He who is without sin \namong you, let him throw a stone at her first, and the mob \ndispersed. More than once the Jews decided to stone Jesus himself for \nblasphemy. If his execution had been Jewish instead of Roman, he \nwould have been stoned instead of crucified. \u0014\n\u0014\nStephen, the first Christian martyr, was stoned for blasphemy (Acts \n7:5460). On one occasion Paul was stoned and left for dead, though \nhe recovered (Acts 14:1920). Stoning was a kind of community \nexecution, with the people as a group stoning the offender. It is \nstill seen that way as the greatest benefit for the society. \nEverybody sees the penalty of sin. Deut. 13:6-11 describes one who \nis to die (9) and how he is to be put to death (10.) This was the \nusual method of community punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see  Word\\Stoning in the Bible\u0014",

    "words": "Call to Honor Pakistani Boy in Fatal Tackle of a Bomber\u0014\nBy SALMAN MASOODJAN. Jan 9, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan  Aitzaz Hasan, a 15-year-old ninth grader, was \nlate for school and rushing with two friends to make the morning \nassembly when they were stopped by a stranger wearing the same \nuniform as theirs, who curiously asked for directions. Aitzaz grew \nsuspicious, and tackled the stranger as he tried to flee. Then the \nstranger blew himself up, killing them both.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suicide bombing on Monday in northwestern Pakistan, where \nIslamist extremism and sectarian mayhem are daily facts of life, has \nstruck a deep nerve in the country  not because of the bomber, \nbelieved to be a Taliban extremist, but because of the student who \nrisked his life, and lost it, to stop him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn a national outpouring of grief and angst that has grown more \nintense as the news of Aitzazs intervention has spread, many \nPakistanis are calling him a hero, worthy of Pakistans highest award \nfor valor. Some are calling him Pakistans male answer to Malala \nYousafzai, 16, who was shot in the head and neck on a school bus in \nnorthwestern Pakistan in October 2012 by Taliban gunmen because she \nhad defied their ban on school attendance by girls. Now a world \ncelebrity, she survived after extensive surgery and rehabilitation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat is unfortunate is that Aitzaz lost his life, Zahidullah \nBengash, a cousin, said on Thursday in a telephone interview from \nIbrahimzai, a village in the Hangu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa \nProvince, which has a history of sectarian violence. What is \nfortunate is that he saved the lives of hundreds of other students.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tRelatives and police officials said the suicide bomber had wanted \nto detonate his explosives at Government Boys High School in \nIbrahimzai. At least 1,000 students study there.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMr. Bengash said Aitzaz and his friends had been rushing to avoid \ntardiness when they encountered the stranger.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIt made my cousin suspicious, and he inquired about the persons \nidentity and why was he never seen in the school earlier, Mr. \nBengash said. The person tried to escape, and Aitzaz tried to tackle \nhim. In this struggle, the bomber blew himself up.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome prominent Pakistani journalists, bloggers and Twitter users \nhave urged the Pakistani government to honor Aitzaz in some \nextraordinary way. The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has \nissued no official response.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe must honor him, Nasim Zehra, a Pakistani journalist and talk \nshow host, said in an interview. Earlier on Thursday, Ms. Zehra \nsuggested on \tTwitter that the teenager should be given \nNishan-e-Haider, the highest Pakistani military award, equivalent to \nthe Medal of Honor\u0014",

    "words": "Sudans Lost Boys Drawn Into Conflict at Home NY Times 1/6/14\u0014\n\u0014\nThe return of South Sudans Lost Boys for the birth of this new \nnation was perhaps the perfect symbol of its hope for a new \nbeginning. Many are American citizens who came back to vote in the \n2011 referendum that split off this country from Sudan, with which it \nfought for decades. Others returned to try to provide the next \ngeneration of South Sudanese children with a better country than the \none they were born into. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, many of these Lost Boys, who had already escaped the violence in \ntheir homeland but found themselves inexorably drawn back, are trying \nto survive the crisis that is threatening to tear their new country \napart. Lost, found and lost again, Mr. Atem says that many of his \ncomrades are now trapped in a dangerous and shaky South Sudan. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome have not made it out alive. Andrew Bith Abui, 32, had just \ngraduated with honors from community college and was living in \nNebraska. Friends and relatives said he was an American citizen and \nplanned to become a police officer. A former teacher described him as \nan intellectual and recalled how Mr. Abui could not wait to \nparticipate in building the new South Sudan. He recently returned \nthere to visit his home in Pariang County in Unity State to reconnect \nwith his family and make arrangements for his marriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the fighting began last month, a relative, Simon Nygok Deng, \n32, was waiting in Juba, refusing to evacuate without Mr. Abui, when \nhe received a call from a satellite phone. A local official in \nPariang informed him that Mr. Abui had been killed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey attacked the village and overran the police, Mr. Deng said. \nThey killed anybody just because they belonged to another tribe. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe conflict that broke out in South Sudan on Dec. 15 has killed well \nover 1,000 people, displaced nearly 200,000 and brought this young \ncountry to the brink of all-out civil war. A political dispute \nbetween President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, has \nspiraled into widespread violence and fear between the two leaders \nethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer, turning civilians into targets \nof the fighting. \u0014\n\u0014\nPhillip Madol, 33, lived in Grand Rapids, Mich., for 13 years, but \nwhen he heard that his mother was sick, he decided to return to South \nSudan six months ago. They barely escaped from a village near Bor as \nantigovernment forces swept through, burning huts and shooting his \nmother in the leg. They joined the tens of thousands fleeing across \nthe White Nile, waiting for assistance here among tens of thousands \nof other desperate people. \u0014\n\u0014\nNobody thought that this would happen, Mr. Madol said, beads of \nsweat on his forehead from the hot sun. Everybody was happy that \nthey got the freedom and they hope to continue to live in peace. \nNow, he said, he was just hoping for another chance to get back to \nthe United States.\u0014",

Today, those violins, named after the Latinized \nform of his name, Stradivarius, are considered priceless. In 2010, a \nStradivarius was purchased for $3.6 million. It is believed there are \nonly around five hundred of them still in existence, some of which \nhave been submitted to the most intense scientific examination in an \nattempt to reproduce their extraordinary sound quality. But no one \nhas been able to replicate Stradivari's craftsmanship.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday we do know that Stradivari used spruce for the top, willow for \nthe internal blocks and linings, and maple for the back, ribs, and \nneck. He also treated the wood with several types of minerals, \nincluding potassium borate, sodium and potassium silicate, as well as \na handmade varnish that appears to have been composed of gum arabic, \nhoney, and egg white.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the genius craftsman never once recorded his technique for \nposterity. Instead, he passed on his knowledge to a number of his \napprentices through what one scholar called \"elbow learning.\" The \napprentices of the great Stradivari didn't learn their craft from \nbooks or manuals but by sitting at his elbow and feeling the wood as \nhe felt it to assess its length, its balance, and its timbre right \nthere in their fingertips. All the learning happened at his elbow, \nand all the knowledge was contained in his fingers.\u0014",

    "words": "Seven Warning Signs of Affairs for Pastors and Other Church Staff\u0014\n\u0014\nRob Ranier 1/29/14\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conversation is always sad, always tragic. The pastor who left \nhis church after a two-year affair with another church member. The \nstudent pastor who has been out of vocational ministry since he had a \nbrief sexual encounter with his assistant.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have spoken with countless numbers of these men and women. And each \ntime I am reminded of how much I need to love God with all my heart, \nand to be totally devoted to my wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the conversations are both sad and tragic, I do learn from \nthem. And after dozens, perhaps a few hundred, of these \nconversations, I see patterns. These patterns become warning signs \nfor any of us, lest we be so nave to think we have no \nvulnerabilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause the conversations were informal, I cannot say for certain \nwhich among them were the most frequent warning signs. So I provide \nthem in no particular order.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. I neglected my family. Church work can become a deceitful \nmistress (I struggle to find the male equivalent of the word). We \nbecome so consumed with our ministry that we neglect our families. \nBut 1 Timothy 3:5 is clear that our families are our first \nministries. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. I had no system of accountability. Unfortunately, most churches \ndo not have clear guidelines for accountability. That does not excuse \nany of us from making sure that we have such self-imposed guidelines, \nand that our spouses know about them as well. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. It began in counseling. Sometimes the word transference is \nused to describe what can happen in counseling. The counselor or \ncounselee becomes the object of attraction instead of ones spouse. \nOne or both of the parties see the other as something his or her \nspouse should be. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. My co-worker and I began to confide in one another on a deep \nlevel. The conversations between two people who work together become \nones that should be restricted to the marital relationship. At this \npoint, an emotional affair has already begun. Physical intimacy is \nusually not far away. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. I began neglecting my time in prayer and daily Bible reading. I \nam reticent to make a blanket statement, but I have never met a \nperson who was praying and reading his or her Bible daily that became \ninvolved in an affair. Prayer and time in the Word are intimacy with \nGod that precludes inappropriate intimacy with someone of the \nopposite gender. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. He or she made me feel so good about myself. In marriage, \nneither party thinks the spouse is perfect; at least it is rare. The \ndanger happens when one becomes a hero to someone of the opposite \ngender. The good feelings that come with accolades or even adulation \ncan become sexual attractions and traps that end in an affair. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. It began on a trip together. When a man and woman travel to the \nsame destination for a work event, conference, or a convention, \nsafeguards need to be established at the onset. A system of \naccountability, whether informal or formal, can break down when a man \nand woman are out of town together. Call me old fashioned, but I \nwont ever travel in the car alone with a woman other than my wife \n(even at my old age). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe conversation is always sad, always tragic. And do you know what \nthe most common theme Ive heard in all of these conversations?\u0014\n\u0014\nI never thought this would happen to me.\u0014",

    "words": "Southern Baptist Church Plants People to Respond to Baptism \u0014\n\u0014\nBrian Kaylor   Ethics Daily\u0014\nPosted: Friday, February 21, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\na quick in and quick out,\" Elevation Church's how-to guide says. \u0014\n\u0014\nElevation Church of Charlotte often posts impressive baptism numbers, \nbut some of the North Carolina churchs techniques for persuading \npeople to walk the aisle are sparking questions and criticisms. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe church advises other churches on hosting large \"spontaneous \nbaptism\" services like the ones at Elevation where thousands come \nforward and immediately get baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, their documents explaining the logistics of such a service are \nleading some Christians to question the church's ethics regarding the \nsacred ordinance that gives Baptists their name.\u0014\n\u0014\nElevation posted a free \"how-to guide\" on leading a \"spontaneous \nbaptism\" service online to encourage other churches to try these \nservices. A two-weekend effort at Elevation saw 2,158 people baptized \nat the four campuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe meticulous guide includes details on ordering clothing materials, \nhow to estimate the number of people who will respond and their \ndemographic breakdown, where to post volunteers, how to time the \nevent, and how to produce media images and stories from it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The first people going into the changing rooms have got to be people \nwho move quickly, they must be changed and out in stage in a few \nminutes,\" the guide advises. \"Pick young energetic people, not \nnecessarily those who are there first.  Think of the room in terms \nof a NASCAR pit stop, it has to be a quick in and quick out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most controversial part of the guide includes the recommendation \nthat a church plant people to be the first to respond to the call to \nbe baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"15 people will sit in the worship experience and be the first ones \nto move when Pastor gives the call,\" the guide notes, adding that the \ngroup has two jobs. \"1. Sit in the auditorium and begin moving \nforward when Pastor Steven says go. 2. Move intentionally through the \nhighest visibility areas and the longest walk.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe guide does not indicate if these individuals, which would likely \nbe more than 15 total since Elevation has four separate campuses and \nmultiple services, actually get baptized or just slip out of line \nafter moving with high visibility as a way of encouraging others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suggestion of planting people quickly sparked criticism on \nChristian blogs after a local television station reported about it \nthis week.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome defenders of Elevation note that Billy Graham Crusades often \nused the strategy of having counselors sitting throughout the stadium \nand then walking down during the altar call, at which point they \nwould then meet with those walking down to make a commitment.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, the language about high visibility and long walk suggests that \nthe individuals are not merely moving forward to serve as counselors \nand the detailed guide never instructs those volunteers to serve that \nfunction.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditionally, the job of meeting with people to talk about the \ndecision is given to a different team in the guide's list of \nvolunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nEthicsDaily.com requested a comment from Elevation Church regarding \nthis practice and its ethics, but did not receive a response.\u0014\n\u0014\nElevation Church officials declined an on-the-record interview on the \ntopic with WCNC-TV in Charlotte (a local NBC affiliate that broke the \nbaptism practices story), but issued a statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat statement, however, did not address the issue of planting people \nin the congregation to act as the first to respond to the call to be \nbaptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Southern Baptist megachurch, a multi-campus congregation often \nnoted as one of the fastest growing churches in the U.S., was founded \nby Steven Furtick in 2006. A graduate of Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary, Furtick is a New York Times bestselling author.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past year, Furtick and Elevation have sparked criticism for \nvarious financial issues, such as Furtick buying a 16,000-square-foot \nhome valued at $1.7 million, Elevation buying copies of Furtick's \nbooks to sell to members, and Elevation not disclosing financial data \n(like staff salaries and benefits) to its members.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church also garnered criticism for a children's coloring book \npromoting Furtick.\u0014\n\u0014\nElevation Church's list of core values includes the declaration, \"We \nare all about the numbers. Tracking metrics measures effectiveness. \nWe unapologetically set goals and measure progress through all \navailable quantitative means.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir numbers-packed \"how-to guide\" for \"spontaneous baptism\" \nservices demonstrates this value.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps this quantitative focus of turning baptisms and other parts \nof church life into a science helps explain the use of planted \nvolunteers ready to walk the aisle while the band plays \"I have \ndecided to follow Jesus.\"\u0014\n\\\u0002Brian Kaylor is a contributing editor for EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "words": "If you go skydiving at the Southwest Florida Skydiving Club in Punta \nGorda, Florida, you can count on two things: (1) an exciting \nexperience and (2) the need to follow some basic rules. For instance, \nbefore you participate in a dive, your \"Jump Master\" will give you \nthe following instructions:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDon't curl up into the fetal position. (You can slip out of your \nharness.) \u0014\n\u0014\n\tArch your back and hold your arms out in front of you. (To keep you \nfrom slipping out of your harness and to get you flying in the \ncorrect position.) \u0014\n\u0014\n\tStick your legs out in front when landing. (No explanation \nnecessary.) \u0014\n\u0014\n\tDo everything your jump master tells you to do. (Immediately) \u0014\n\u0014\n\tNo pets allowed on your jump.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are not negotiable, especially if you want to live. They are \nabsolutes. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow let's imagine another skydiving experience. When you arrive a \nsmiling instructor begins strapping a parachute to your back while \nwalking you toward a plane idling just outside. Over the plane's \nengine noise the instructor yells, \"We here at the Relativist \nSkydiving School believe there are many ways to get from the plane to \nthe ground. We respect everyone's desire to skydive and we don't \nbelieve in absolute rules. Just listen to your inner voice, respond \nhonestly to your feelings, and have a memorable experience. We'll see \nyou when you get down!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIf that was your experience, would you go skydiving? Most people who \ngo skydiving are glad that there are strict, nonnegotiable rules. You \ncan't be a relativist at skydiving. The rules are there for good \nreason. When we know why the rules are there it helps us embrace them.\u0014",

    "title": "SEVEN WAYS CHRISTIANS CAN LIE",
    "words": "Here is a short list, in no particular order, of seven of the ways \nthat I am aware that I and others have lied (and still do) when we \npractice cross-spiritual communication. I hope that you will add your \nown thoughts in the comments below. Maybe we will get to share a \nclassroom of epiphanies together right here in Leadership Journal.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we claim we are more confident than we really are. The \nculture of pretending within Christianity seems almost at an epidemic \nlevel. Many of us feel the need to hide our doubts and questions. We \nfeel compelled to act like our faith life is totally satisfying, when \nin fact it often feels limited, dry, cold or numb. I think we also \nbelieve that our \"witness\" will be less powerful if we reveal a less \nthan \"perfect\" religious experience. The funny thing is that the \nopposite is often true. Non-Christians are often drawn to stories of \nan authentic and even struggling faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we claim that unexplainable things are in fact \nexplainable. God is transcendent and beyond even the shadowy wisps of \nimagination in our finite minds. The Trinity, for instance, is not as \nsimple as a metaphor of water (ice, water, steam) or an egg (shell, \nwhite, yoke). Sometimes I think we would be better off if we just \nsaid, \"These ideas are so beyond me that if God did reveal them to \nme, I am pretty sure my brain would explode.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we don't acknowledge our doubts within the drama of \nfaith. This is similar to number one above but just on a more \ndetailed level. When another person challenges us with a difficult \ntheological/philosophical issue, sometimes it is best to just admit \nthat those questions are very challenging and even emotionally taxing \non the soul (I think people like to know that our faith is so \nimportant to us that it does impact our soul-state in both \nencouraging and difficult ways.) Difficult questions for me include: \nWhat is the destiny of people with no access to the true and loving \nmessage of Christ's gospel? Where did evil come from? Why did God put \nthis whole human story into motion when it has caused so much pain?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we pretend like the Bible doesn't say some really nasty \nthings when in fact it does. For instance, God commands genocide. He \njust does  at least from a clear and honest reading of the Bible. \nThere is also a verse that says, \"Happy is the one who seizes your \ninfants and dashes them against the rocks (Psalms 137:9).\" If we want \nthe Bible to be our document, we need to own the whole thing. (The \nsame thing can be said for the atrocities in the story of the church, \npast and present.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we claim we understand other beliefs, faiths and world \nviews. We need to stop saying things like, \"I understand Islam,\" or, \n\"I know what a Muslim thinks/believes.\" Do you want someone saying \nthat they understand your faith experience because they once lived in \na Greek Orthodox neighborhood? Do you think a Muslim would accurately \nunderstand your beliefs because they read a book about Christianity \n(particularly one written by Muslim scholars)? Belief systems are \nextremely diverse (heck, in Christianity there are hundreds of \nProtestant denominations alone, before we even talk about Orthodox, \nCoptic, Armenian, Syrian, Palestinian, just to scratch the surface). \nOther religions are just as diverse. Further more, faith experience \ncan be as specific as a neighborhood, family or individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lie when we claim that all of our beliefs are a \"10\". This one is \nprobably going to frustrate some people, but we are disingenuous when \nwe claim all of our dogmas with equal veracity. To put it another \nway, on a scale of one to ten, not all Christian beliefs are a \"10.\" \nDo I believe in the historicity of a floating zoo? Yes I do. Do I \nhold to the specific details of that historic event with the same \n\"lay my life on the line\" conviction as I do the historical death on \na cross and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth? No, I do not. The \ndetails of the zoo are not a 10 for me. Jesus is a 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, and most importantly, we lie (insidious and barbaric lying) \nwhen we pretend like we really, really, really love the other person \nwhen in fact we don't. We do not love people when we dismiss their \nstory (including their hopes, values, beliefs and convictions). We do \nnot love people when we do not empathically listen to them, as \nopposed to spending that time formulating a counter-argument. We do \nnot love others when we reduce them to labels, caricatures, or \nopponents. If we love, then we will find them shockingly beautiful \nand fascinating creations. We will find their stories riveting. We \nwill radiate affection. Humans know deep down when they are or are \nnot truly loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would like to close with a different sort of lie. This is not a way \nthat I lie, but instead a way that I was lied to. I was lied to by \nreligious people. They told me that cross-spiritual communication is \ndangerous. It is dangerous because when I do it, there is a strong \npossibility that it will divide and the other person will become my \nenemy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, in my experience sharing my faith around the world and in my \npost-Christian city, if we can share honestly, authentically and with \nhumility, division does not happen. Instead, Friendship Happens.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2014 by the author or Christianity Today/Leadership \nJournal.\u0014\nTony Kriz is a writer and church leader from Portland, Oregon\u0014",

    "words": "Scapegoating Just Isn't \nWhat It Used to Be \u0014\n\u0014\nColin Harris  March 21, 2014 EthicsDaily.com \u0014\n\u0014\nI attended a recent lecture by Rabbi Reuven Firestone of Hebrew Union \nCollege in Los Angeles, who spoke on the history and features of \nanti-Semitism and Islamophobia. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis theme was that both have their roots in the broader human \nphenomenon of \"scapegoating\"  the ancient Hebrew liturgical \natonement practice, which has become a metaphor for \"putting away\" \npersonal and communal sins by \"sending them into the wilderness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFirestone suggested that this process of selecting a rather \ndefenseless \"other\" as the bearer of the sins of a community lies at \nthe heart of historical and contemporary animosity toward Jews and \nMuslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelecting a scapegoat as the bearer of sins seems to have been part \nof the worship experience that embraced the importance of repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ritual act of sending it away, loaded with the sins of the people \nas part of the atonement ritual, was an annual cleansing of the \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe've left behind many of these ancient practices, but Firestone \nreminded me that this one is still with us in particularly damaging \nforms.\u0014\n\u0014\nA subtle but real evolution of scapegoating has led to focusing \nresponsibility for conditions and unwanted features of life on \nindividuals or groups that can be profiled to reflect whatever the \nproblem is.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can see it enacted in many contemporary actions, which include:\u0014\n\u0014\n? Believing we have adequately solved a problem if we can \nsuccessfully determine whose fault it is, most visibly within our \npolitical processes that seem less committed to addressing problems \nthan to assigning responsibility for them.\u0014\n\u0014\n? Seeking to identify and eliminate unwanted groups whose presence is \nseen as a detriment to the \"purity\" of a society, such as the \"Jewish \nproblem\" of Hitler's Germany and the anti-gay movement in Uganda.\u0014\n\u0014\n? Profiling of groups on the basis of what extremists do in their \nname; recall the Islamophobia that was ignited in the wake of the \n9/11 attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\n? Demonizing the \"other\" in response to natural catastrophes or \nsociopolitical problems, such as blaming the poor for poverty, \nimmigrants for the challenges of demographic change, or disliked \nleaders for whatever is not functioning to one's advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern scapegoating shifts our operative question from \"How can we \nrespond to this?\" to \"Who can we blame for this?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems to have evolved from its origins as a liturgical symbol of \natonement to an exercise of focusing responsibility for a real or \nperceived problem on a convenient person or group.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of an expression of confession and repentance, it has become \nan act of projection and denial.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goat is sent away while the sins remain to do their infectious \nwork. The underlying estrangement that was the heart of the problem \nis still there.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, economic \ndisparity/exploitation and demonizing the \"other\" all are still there.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs of old, the priests of the modern ideological community still \nselect the goat on which the sins of society can be laid; they pile \nthem on, with the help of an all-saturating media.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the ceremony is carried out to drive the sin-laden scapegoat out \ninto the wilderness of rejection, the people say, \"Amen!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat causes this evolution from an acknowledgement and confession of \nsin to a projection and a denial of it?\u0014\n\u0014\nCould it be the same tendency that produced the golden calf  \nreducing Yahweh to something that could be seen and managed by \nelevating the \"gold\" that we value, whether material or ideas, to the \nstatus of divinity and something to be served and protected at all \ncost?\u0014\n\u0014\nCrossbreeding a scapegoat with a golden calf produces a strange \noffspring that is a far cry from a symbol for a covenant community \nwhere all work together for the common good.\u0014\n\u0014\nColin Harris is professor emeritus of religious studies at Mercer \nUniversity and a member of Smoke Rise Baptist Church in Stone \nMountain, Ga.\u0014",

    "title": "SEXUAL COMPLIMENTARITY: A DANGEROUS DEBATE",
    "words": "Sexual complementarity: A \ndangerous debate\u0014\n\u0014\nIts advocates rarely speak of the consequences of womens \nnoncompliance to their husbands alleged authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy David Burroughs\u0014\n\u0014\nI read with interest the story in ABPnews/Herald about Dr. David \nPlatts sermon given recently at Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary. In reality, I no longer pay much attention to things said \nby Southern Baptist leaders these days. But this one caught my eye \nfor three reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\n Rev. Platt was speaking at my alma mater.\u0014\n Rev. Platt pastors the Church at Brook Hills, a large and \ninfluential church in Birmingham, where I live.\u0014\n I find this message alarming and careless.\u0014\n\u0014\nI actually have much respect for David Platt. He takes his faith and \nhis church very seriously, calling his congregation to deep, \nlife-transforming action on behalf of those in Birmingham and around \nthe world who cant act on their own because of oppression, poverty, \nsickness and worse. Platt has been an example to me and to many \nothers in this regard.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatching a video of Platts talk given at the chapel on Southerns \ncampus, I found myself nodding along to his passionate pleas for \nSouthern Baptist students to take care of the poor, engage in social \njustice and share the gospel. Then seemingly out of nowhere, Platt \ndirected the same passion and emotional emphasis to sexual \ncomplementarity, which by definition works to keep women in their \nplace, subservient to men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his talk, Platt speaks about four gospel truths, ironically all \ntaken from Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, not from the \nGospels of the New Testament which detail Jesus actual words and \nactions. Watching his sermon, Platts gospel truths seemed more like \nopinion and conjecture, as he repeated his claim that, We flee \nsexual immorality in our lives and we defend sexual complementarity \nfor the sake of the gospel in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nComplementarity does sound nice, doesnt it? It makes one think the \npoint for a successful marriage is giving lots of compliments: \nDarling, I love those new shoes you are wearing!\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, sexual complementarity is merely thinly veiled language for \nthe systematic subjugation of women  plain and simple. At best, this \nflawed and sexist view suggests that the husband is the only \ndecision-maker of the family and at worst, causes a woman to feel \npressured into submitting to any desires and whims of her husband, \nwho has total authority over her  just, they say, as Jesus has \nauthority over the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch has been written for and against this view of a marriage \nrelationship, but this line of thought is just wrong. Its wrong \nbecause the larger biblical narrative shows that God values and loves \nboth genders equally, Jesus treated women as equals and women are \nleaders throughout the Bible  from Deborah in Judges to Phoebe in \nRomans.\u0014\n\u0014\nSexual complementarity is not only incorrect; it is also dangerous. \nIn todays society, where speeches have an indeterminate shelf life, \noverly authoritative words can carry damaging consequences. This \nteaching too easily leads to spousal abuse. The logic goes like this: \nPastor David says that I am the authority in the home and so you \nwill do what I want and if not, there will be consequences. And \nPlatt never mentioned anything about consequences for non-compliance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Platt neared the end of his talk, he told stories of brokenness in \nthe world that the Christian church needs to address, including sex \ntrafficking. The irony is that sexual complementarity begins with \nsubmission to male authority in the home and leads to a culture where \nwomens thoughts and opinions have less value than their male \ncounterparts. Men become accustomed to an environment where they call \nthe plays and women are expected to comply. Taken to its logical \nextreme, sexual complementarity eventually leads to a world where sex \ntrafficking is ubiquitous.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an ordained minister of the gospel and graduate of the same \nseminary at which Rev. Pratt was speaking, I must disagree. The \ncontinued propagation of sexual complementarity as a gospel truth is, \nin my view, unacceptable and dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\nI counter with a Baptist voice celebrating that in Christ there is no \nJew or Greek, no male or female. I am thankful for seminaries that \naccept, mentor and send out powerful women who are preaching an \nauthoritative word in Baptist pulpits around the country. I commend \nthe Baptist congregations who have called women to serve as pastor \nand to represent them as community leaders. Frankly, as the church \nhas listened to men preach for centuries, I find it refreshing to \nhear a thoughtful and, yes, complementary word from the Lord from the \nfresh perspective of a womens voice.\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe Gods call does not discriminate and that we can all be \ngifted to serve and lead equally at every level of our churches and \nin our communities. I particularly believe this\u0014",

Why do we fixate on that which \ndistinguishes ourselves from one another  such as the ethnic \nmarkings on our forehead, the color of our skin  rather than that \nwhich we have in common?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe were formed from the same clay, individually distinct, but \ncollectively resembling the very face of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we raise a hand against another, we only bring it down upon \nourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Ann and I do not know what our long-term plans will be, or what \nkind of future this country faces, we do know that we are needed \nhere, we are safe, and we have all the support and prayers for which \none could ever hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will thus continue to help even if it means rebuilding what we \njust yesterday put together, but more important, we will make a stand \nfor justice, mercy and walking humbly with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Clemmer is the South Sudan representative for IMA World Health\u0014",

    "title": "SPECTACLE OR SUBSTANCE",
    "words": "Too much of Christian witness today is more spectacle than substance. \nThere is substance out there, yet it is overshadowed by the spectacle \nof end times prophecies or publicity stunts. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the past few years, where we have seen a pastor in Dallas \nspend 24 hours in a bed on top of his church sitting there with his \nwife. Why? To make the point that Christians need to talk more about \nsex. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn early March, a church in Kentucky made headlines by giving away \nfirearms to guests visiting their church. Why? To get people in the \ndoors. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch events recall Oral Roberts threatening in January 1987 that he \nneeded to collect $8 million by March to fund a hospital he was \nbuilding  or else.\u0014\n\u0014\n He said, \"We're at the point where God could call Oral Roberts home \nin March.\" He got the money and opened the hospital. It closed two \nyears later. \u0014\n\u0014\nToo much of our religious fervor has been reserved for spectacle and \nprophecy that has little to do with the life-saving mission of Jesus \nChrist. Our spiritual zeal is tapped out by prophecies and stunts \nintended for shock and awe.\u0014\n\u0014\n These ploys feed our fears instead of inspiring us with love and \ncompassion for God's world. Instead of sending us out two by two to \nproclaim the gospel and heal the sick (see Mark 6:7-13), we scramble \nfor bottled water and head for our bunkers to wait out the worst. \u0014\n\u0014\nI read the Sermon on the Mount, and skip over the end of Daniel. My \nchurch passes out delicious cookies to guests while I tell our church \nmembers that if they gave a little more to the budget we could really \ndream big. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe seem to fail at every turn  always choosing the circus over the \nsanctuary. We will give anything  guns, iPads, cookies, even money  \nwhen what Christ really demands is that we risk ourselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis temptation lurks around every corner of life and ministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nGarrett Vickrey is senior pastor of Woodland Baptist Church in San \nAntonio, Texas    \u0014\nEthicsDaily.com  4/23/14\u0014",

    "words": "If you really want to hurt your pastor, follow these guidelines \ncarefully.\u0014\n\u0014\nCriticize the pastors family. Few things are as painful to pastors \nas criticizing their families, especially if the criticisms are \nrelated to issues in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nTell the pastor he is overpaid. Very few pastors really make much \nmoney. But there are a number of church members who would like to \nmake the pastor feel badly about his pay.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont defend the pastor. Critics can be hurtful. But even more \nhurtful are those who remain silent while their pastor is verbally \nattacked. Silence is not golden in this case.\u0014\n\u0014\nTell your pastor what an easy job he has. It can really sting when \nsomeone suggests that the pastor really only works about ten hours a \nweek. Some actually believe that pastors have several days a week off.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe a constant naysayer. Pastors can usually handle the occasional \ncritic. But the truly painful relationships are with church members \nwho are constantly negative. How do you know youve succeeded in this \nregard? The pastor runs the other way when he sees you.\u0014\n\u0014\nMake comments about the pastors expenditures. I heard it from a \npastor this past week. A church member asked, How can you afford to \ngo to Disney World? Wow.\u0014\n\u0014\nCompare your pastors preaching and ministry unfavorably to that of \nanother pastor. Many times the member wants you to know how much he \nor she likes that pastor on the podcast compared to you. If you \nreally want to hurt your pastor, you can make certain he knows how \ninferior he is.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, if your lifes goal is to hurt your pastor, one or more of these \napproaches will work just fine.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, if you are like most good church members, you want the best for \nyour pastor. So just do the opposite of these seven.\u0014",

    "words": "By Nima Elbagir, CNN \u0014\nJune 6, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nKhartoum, Sudan (CNN) 6/26/14 -- Two names and two families at the \nheart of a tragedy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAl-Samani al-Hadi is one of three brothers, and what he calls their \n\"private family business\" has captured the attention of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Firstly I want to say, I am the brother of the convicted woman Abrar \nal-Hadi\", he tells CNN in his first sit-down interview since the \nwoman he claims is his sister -- known as Mariam Yahya Ibrahim in \nmedia reports -- was sentenced to death by a court in Sudan for \nabandoning the Muslim faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman, 27, was raised as a Christian by her mother and is married \nto a Christian man. But because her father -- who deserted the family \nwhen the woman was a child -- was Muslim, the courts consider her to \nbe the same and asked her to recant her faith. She refused, and is \nnow languishing in Omdurman Women's Prison, just outside Khartoum.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Her name isn't Mariam, her name is Abrar al-Hadi. I am al-Samani \nal-Hadi Mohamed Abdullah, her full -- older -- brother,\" al-Hadi, \nspeaking to CNN from an Islamic Center in Omdurman, tells us as he \nrattles off dates and details in an attempt to prove this is the \nsister he grew up with.\u0014\n\u0014\nMariam -- or Abrar -- is currently hoping her that the courts will \nbelieve the story of her life as she tells it, according to her \nhusband. She insists that she was brought up by a Christian mother \nand has never practiced Islam. And in spite of visits by religious \nscholars and Sudanese government officials pressuring her to recant, \nit's a story she's sticking to.\u0014\n\u0014\nI found myself returning to the same question time and again in this \ninterview -- is al-Hadi really prepared to see the woman he claims is \nhis sister killed?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's one of two; if she repents and returns to our Islamic faith and \nto the embrace of our family then we are her family and she is ours. \nWe are prepared to hold her dearer than the apples of our eyes. But \nif she refuses she should be executed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as all eyes are on Sudan's Court of Appeal, for al-Hadi there is \nno turning back.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why would I indulge my humanity, my emotions and incur the wrath of \nmy Lord? That's not how it works for us.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SABBATH IS NOT A MEANS TO MORE PRODUCTIVE WORK",
    "words": "David Zahl on Amy Becker blog\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter Brueggemann considers the Fourth Commandmentthe one that \nmandates Sabbath rest \"the most difficult and most urgent of \ncommandments in our society.\" He's not just talking about the \nencroachment of soccer game schedules and 24-hour pharmacies and \nphantom limb-like smartphones. He's referring to a fundamentally \nrestless culture, and the challenges it poses to anyone who might be \nso bold as to take the Sinai injunction seriously. (As he points out \nin his new booklet, Sabbath as Resistance, as much as we make of the \nother commandments, it is the fourth that gets the most ink, both in \nExodus and Deuteronomy).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe current situation is a tad ironic. Talk to a member of the \n\"greatest generation\" about their childhood Sundays and they will \ninvariably relate youthful frustrations about Sabbath prohibitions. \nThey will tell about blue laws. About no baseball on Sunday. No \nmovies. No shopping. To most of them, Sabbath did not represent an \noasis of inactivityit represented a resounding No, an inflexible Law \nput there to confound fun and frivolity. They describe an environment \nwhere what was intended for good had hardened into a mode of control \nand repressionlegalism, if you will. The spirit had been lost, as it \noften is.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, the zeitgeist has shifted. What was once prohibition might now \nbe heard as permission: to stop, take a breath, and remember that we \nare more than what we produce, more than our job title or bank \nbalance. Sabbath, in this light, does indeed represent resistance to \nthe dominating paradigm of more more more, an invitation to, well, \nthe experience of grace. As Brueggemann writes,\u0014\n\u0014\nThe alternative on offer [in the Sabbath] is the awareness and \npractice of the claim that we are situated on the receiving end of \nthe gifts of God. To be so situated is a staggering option, because \nwe are accustomed to being on the initiating end of all things. We \nneither expect nor even want a gift to be given, so inured are we to \naccomplishing and achieving and possessing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs if we needed more proof that God is not an American! But \nseriously, there is something beautiful and true and deeply \nreorienting about the Sabbath. We should all take more advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, lest we mistake Law for grace, it is still a part of the \nDecalogue. The Law cannot engender what it commands. That is to say, \nas tempting as it may be, a louder, more articulate expression of \ndivinely mandated rest will not inspire repose in those for whom work \nand 'doing' has become integral to their self-justificationwhich is \nall of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: It is still not in the New Covenant. The truth of rest is still \nappropriate, but not a demand for Seventh Day. Christians live by the \nNew Covenant, which never mentions \"Shabat.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Single Americans Are Rapidly Multiplying\u0014\nKiley Crossland | WORLD News Service | Monday, September 22, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nSingles now make up the majority of the adult U.S. population, \naccording to research reported by Bloomberg. \u0014\n\u0014\nRoughly 125 million Americans, or 50.2 percent ages 16 years or \nolder, are single, up from 37.4 percent in 1976, according to the \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u0014\n\u0014\nBloomberg credited Edward Yardeni, a Wall Street economist and market \nstrategist, with identifying the shift by using the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics August job-market data. In a private report to his \nclients, entitled Selfies, Yardeni said the remarkable trend has \nimplications for our economy, society, and politics. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, he noted that singles are more likely to rent than buy. \nLess marriage also means fewer children, which shifts spending \nhabits. He also said more single-person households exaggerate income \ninequality. While they have less household earnings than married \npeople, they also have fewer expenses, especially if there are no \nchildren in their households, Yardeni wrote. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the number of divorced, separated, or widowed singles has \nincreased since the 1970s, the larger increase, from 22.1 percent to \nmore than 30 percent, came from a growing number of singles who never \nmarry, Yardeni found. Some argue this increase is the result of more \ncouples deciding to cohabitate instead of marry. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther research confirms the trend and its economic implications. \nAccording to U.S. Census data, married-couple households are no \nlonger the norm, households are getting smaller, and more people are \nliving alone, especially men. The percentage of U.S. households with \nmarried couples dropped more than 20 percent from 1970 to 2012, from \n70.6 to 48.7 percent, according to a census report released in \nAugust. While the percentage of households with married couples and \nno children remained virtually the same, the drastic drop came in \nmarried households with children under 18. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe increased flexibility of singles has economic benefits, but more \nsingles can also mean decreasing economic stability, Allison Schrager \nwrote in an article for Businessweek. With fewer fixed expenses, \nfamily ties, mortgages to pay, and kids to put through college, \nsingles are more likely to move for a job or start an entrepreneurial \nventure. But they also are less stable for the future economy. A lost \njob, injury, or illness is a major hit for a single-person household. \nAnd no children means no new households, no new taxpayers, and a \ndearth of future caretakers for the current generation when they age. \u0014\n\u0014\nA growing number of singles also means people are leaving the suburbs \nin favor of cities. Singles make up more than half of the population \nin more than 46 of the 51 largest U.S. metros, Richard Florida wrote \nin an article for The Atlantics CityLab. If families prefer the \nsuburbs for schools and safety, singles prefer denser urban \nneighborhoods with more to do and greater opportunities to meet and \nconnect with singles.\u0014",

    "words": "Search and Rescue Team: Children Know They Are Lost \u0014\n\u0014\nIn her book, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, Rebecca Solnit tells the \nstory of her friend Sallie who is part of a search-and-rescue team in \nthe Rocky Mountains. Sallie still remembers the frantic search for a \nlost eleven-year-old boy who was deaf and losing his eyesight. The \nboy wandered off during a late afternoon game of hide-and-seek. \nBecause he was deaf, he was particularly hard to find. He had been \nblowing a whistle given him for just such an occasion, but could not \nhear how close he was to a nearby stream. The roar of the water made \nhis signal impossible for those searching for him to hear. After a \nharrowing night on his own, the sun came up, and he started blowing \nhis whistle again. The search-and-rescue team finally found him, very \ncold but okay.\u0014\n\u0014\nSallie and other search-and-rescue experts say that the key to \nsurvival often hinges on one thing: knowing and admitting that you \nare lost. That's why kids are found more often than adults. Kids \ndon't stray as far. They usually curl up in a sheltered place and \nwait for their rescuers.

    "title": "SQUANTO AND THE MIRACLE OF THANKSGIVING",
    "words": "Most of us know the story of the first Thanksgiving; at least we know \nthe Pilgrim version. But how many of us know the Indian viewpoint? \u0014\n\u0014\nNo, I'm not talking about some revisionist, politically correct \nversion of history. I'm talking about the amazing story of the way \nGod used an Indian named Squanto as a special instrument of His \nprovidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nHistorical accounts of Squanto's life vary, but historians believe \nthat around 1608, more than a decade before the Pilgrims arrived, a \ngroup of English traders sailed to what is today Plymouth, \nMassachusetts. When the trusting Wampanoag Indians came out to trade, \nthe traders took them prisoner, transported them to Spain, and sold \nthem into slavery. It was an unimaginable horror. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut God had an amazing plan for one of the captured Indians, a boy \nnamed Squanto. \u0014\n\u0014\nSquanto was bought by a well-meaning Spanish monk, who treated him \nwell and taught him the Christian faith. Squanto eventually made his \nway to England and worked in the stables of a man named John Slaney. \nSlaney sympathized with Squanto's desire to return home, and he \npromised to put the Indian on the first vessel bound for America. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't until 1619, ten years after Squanto was first kidnapped, \nthat a ship was found. Finally, after a decade of exile and \nheartbreak, Squanto was on his way home. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut when he arrived in Massachusetts, more heartbreak awaited him. An \nepidemic had wiped out Squanto's entire village. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe can only imagine what must have gone through Squanto's mind. Why \nhad God allowed him to return home, against all odds, only to find \nhis loved ones dead? \u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, the answer came. A shipload of English families arrived \nand settled on the very land once occupied by Squanto's people. \nSquanto went to meet them, greeting the startled Pilgrims in English. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the diary of Pilgrim Governor William Bradford, Squanto \n\"became a special instrument sent of God for [our] good . . . He \nshowed [us] how to plant [our] corn, where to take fish and to \nprocure other commodities . . . and was also [our] pilot to bring \n[us] to unknown places for [our] profit, and never left [us] till he \ndied.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Squanto lay dying of fever, Bradford wrote that their Indian \nfriend \"desir[ed] the Governor to pray for him, that he might go to \nthe Englishmen's God in heaven.\" Squanto bequeathed his possessions \nto the Pilgrims \"as remembrances of his love.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWho but God could so miraculously convert a lonely Indian and then \nuse him to save a struggling band of Englishmen? It is reminiscent of \nthe biblical story of Joseph, who was also sold into slavery, and \nwhom God likewise used as a special instrument for good. \u0014\n\u0014\nSquanto's life story is remarkable, and we ought to make sure our \nchildren learn about it. Sadly, most books about Squanto omit \nreferences to his Christian faith. But Im delighted to say that my \nfriend Eric Metaxas has written a wonderful childrens book called \nSquanto and the Miracle of Thanksgiving. I highly recommend it \nbecause it will teach your kids about the \"special instrument sent of \nGod,\" who changed the course of American history.\u0014",

    "words": "Martyrdom of St. Valentine\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nToday we exchange cards expressing love or appreciation for one \nanother. According to tradition, on this day, February 14, 269, a \nyoung man named Valentine was executed in Rome for his faith. But \nwhat does our exchange of sentimental cards have to do with a third \ncentury martyr?\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, the connection is not at all clear. Valentine was martyred \nthe day before the pagan festival to the goddess Februata Juno at \nwhich boys drew girls' names for acts of sexual promiscuity. Were \nlegends about the martyr's death modified to replace the heathen \ncustom? No one knows for sure. In fact, there may have been two or \neven three martyrs named Valentine who died in different parts of the \nempire at about the same time. We know little or nothing about any of \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the Roman Valentine as an example. A city gate on the Flaminian \nWay and a chapel near it were named for him. Several ancient \nChristian writers mention his name. There is no doubt he lived and \nwas tortured before being beaten with clubs and beheaded. And yet we \nhave no sure account of why.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome say this Valentine was a young man with a tender heart who aided \nChristians who were undergoing martyrdom. He was not even a Christian \nat the time. Arrested for his activities, he converted to faith while \nin prison and would not renounce it. Knowing he was going to die, he \nwrote letters to his friends saying \"Remember your Valentine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother legend says that the Roman Valentine was a priest who defied \nthe Emperor Claudius's temporary order and secretly married couples \nso the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. Claudius desperately \nneeded more soldiers and did not appreciate this interference.\u0014\n\u0014\nA third legend says the Roman Valentine was a priest who refused to \nsacrifice to pagan gods. Imprisoned for this, he gave testimony in \nprison and through his prayers the jailer's daughter was healed. On \nthe day of his execution he left her a note signed \"Your Valentine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Middle ages it was popularly believed birds paired in \nmid-February. This also reaffirmed the association of romantic love \nwith Valentine's name. Whatever the truth behind the legends, St. \nValentine's day has become a day we connect with romance and \nfriendship.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"History of Valentine's Day, the.\" History Channel. \n(www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/history.html).\u0014\nHutchinson, Ruth and Adams, Ruth.

Some 170,000 \u0014\nwomen and girls here in the U'K, have already undergone female \ncircumcision, and another 65,000 \u0014\ngirls are at risk. One hospital in Birmingham says it sees at least \nsix victims of this horrific procedure \u0014\nevery week. Many of them are women who immigrated to Britain after \nbeing cut in their home \u0014\ncountries, but some are young girls who were mutilated here. \nLawmakers are now discussing a na- \u0014\ntional plan to end the practice in the Ll.K, once and for all, but \nactivists worry the government is show- \u0014\ning too much deference to the practitioners. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe plan will see officials work with \"communities\" that harbor the \nguilty--an idea that Nimko Ali, an \u0014\nanti-female circumcision activist, finds patronizing and dangerous. \n\"This is child abuse,\" she says. \u0014\n\"You wouldn't negotiate with pedophiles in order to defeat \npedophilia,\" so why negotiate with cut- \u0014\nters?

The focus now should be on \u0014\nprotecting girls who are at risk-and that means training teachers, \nhealth-care providers, and social \u0014\nworkers to be on the lookout, ready to intervene.

    "words": "Slaughterhouse Gospel\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy God dwelling with us meant gruesome rituals.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Stearns/ April 1, 2015 Christianity today\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we read the Old Testament it is easy to imagine ourselves awed by \nthe great temple of Solomon and the tabernacle that proceeded \nitGod's dwelling place in the midst of Israel. One of the first \nthings God commanded after the exodus from Egypt was the building of \na tabernacle where God could dwell among his people as Israel made \nits way across the wilderness toward the Promised Land. Centuries \nlater, Solomon would replace the tabernacle with the more permanent, \nstunningly beautiful temple.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the final chapters of Exodus we read about the building of the \ntabernacle with its magnificent architecture, courtyards, lamp \nstands, adornments of jewels and precious metals, and beautiful woven \ncurtains. God specified every detail of what must have been a truly \nmajestic structure filled with works of art, craftsmanship, and \nbeauty. Moses personally oversaw its construction.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut we rarely think about these places as slaughterhouses. Their \noverriding purpose was to be a place of carnage where animals were \nbrutally and graphically sacrificedthousands upon thousands of them, \nday after day and year after year.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf he presents a sheep as his offering, he must present it before the \nLord. He must lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter \nit before the Meeting Tent, and the sons of Aaron must splash its \nblood against the altar's sides. Then he must present a gift to the \nLord from the peace offering sacrifice: He must remove all the fatty \ntail up to the end of the spine, the fat covering the entrails, and \nall the fat on the entrails, the two kidneys with the fat on their \nsinews, and the protruding lobe on the liver (which he is to remove \nalong with the kidneys). Then the priest must offer it up in smoke on \nthe altar as a food gift to the Lord. (Lev. 3:7-11, NET)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis gruesome ritual was repeated daily for centuries on an \nunimaginable scale. When Solomon first dedicated the temple, he and \nthe people of Israel sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and \ngoats in one continuous dedication ceremony.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy, God?\u0014\n\u0014\nTry to imagine this happening every Sunday at your church, at all \nfour services. Picture your pastor arm-deep in viscera, ripping out \nkidneys, livers, and fat and then splashing blood all over the front \nof your church. Smell the stench from the burning flesh and feel the \nrepugnance of the constant slaughter. This was the grisly horror of \nOld Testament worship. But why? Why would God require this?\u0014\nPicture your pastor arm deep in viscera, ripping out kidneys, livers \nand fat and then splashing blood all over the front of your church.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have struggled with this ever since I first became a believer. I \nnow believe that God, in the most graphic way, was trying to \nillustrate to his people the severity and the offense to him of the \nsin of mankind and the corruption of his spectacular creation. He \ncreated a magnificent universe of unimaginable vastness and beauty \nwith galaxies, planets, and stars. He created the earth and \neverything in it. Flowers, trees, and every kind of seed-bearing \nplantthe animal kingdom with everything from whales to hummingbirds \nto insects.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd all of this had been prepared for his most special creation of \nall: us. Imagine our loving God preparing all of this for us and \nbeing so eager to share it with us. Imagine his joy in placing Adam \nand Eve in the Garden. And then the heartbreak when our response was \nto disobey him, reject him, and instead follow the advice of the \nserpent. This was our response to his lavish goodness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no alternative for a just God. His own standard of justice \nrequired that sin must be punishedactions must have consequences. \nThat justice, unless restrained, would have required the destruction \nof the human race. But God is a God of love and so he found a \ndifferent way.\u0014\nHe instructed his people to create a truly magnificent tabernacle, \nperhaps as a symbol of his own wonderful creation, and then he \ninstructed them to fill it with death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would turn his wrath away from them, yes. But he would show them \nthe bloody consequences of sin in the most graphic way. He would set \naside a people and put blood sacrifice at the center of their daily \nlives, showing them that their sin must be atoned through blood. The \nslaughterhouse would be his way of communicating the severity of \nhuman sin and the requirement for atonement. Hundreds of thousands of \nanimals would shed their blood in a symbolism that was hard to miss.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Next?\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, after more than 1,000 years of bloody ritual in the tabernacle \nand the temple, God said, \"Enough slaughter!\" Instead, he turned his \nwrath to his own son: the Lamb of God who would finally take away the \nsin of the world. Blood, suffering, and death to the innocent Son of \nGod. Once and for all, the slaughter would stop, the price finally \npaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are told that at the moment of Christ's death, the temple curtain, \nwhich shielded the most holy placethe Mercy Seatwas torn in two. \nThis was the curtain behind which the high priest, only on the Day of \nAtonement, would perform the blood sacrifice for the sins of Israel. \nJesus became the sacrificethe Lamb of God without blemish. Now the \nsins of mankind would no longer require blood sacrifices through a \npriest. When Jesus cried out on the cross, \"It is finished,\" the \nslaughterhouse was no longer necessary. The temple was destroyed in \nA.D. 70 by a Roman army and was never rebuilt.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or \ngold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to \nyou from your ancestors, but with the precious blood of Christ, a \nlamb without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of \nthe world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. (1 \nPet. 1:18-20, NIV)\u0014\n\u0014\nSo when you go to worship God this Sunday in the pleasant \nsurroundings of your home church, remember the slaughterhouse and the \nprice that has been paid for you. Jesus, the Lamb of God, took sin \nand evil upon himself and removed the separation between God and man \nonce and forevermore.\u0014\nThe celebration of Communion harkens back to those animal sacrifices \nbut for us, the body and blood of Christ has replaced all of the \ncarnage. The doors of the kingdom of heaven have been thrown open and \nwe have been invited in. In Christ, men and women are reunited with \nGod's great love for life everlasting.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Stearns is the president of World Vision U.S. and author of \nUnfinished: Filling the Hole in Our Gospel.\u0014",

    "words": "Savonarola's Interrogation and Sentence\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man left home secretly at 23, without parental approval, \nflinging aside years of medical and philosophical education, to join \nthe Dominicans. Convinced of the reality of the after-life, with its \ndismal doom or glorious salvation, he became morose. An urgent sense \nof right drove him to denounce the morals of the day. At first his \nmessages were too scholarly for the masses, but in time they gained \npower. Audiences pressed into chapel to hear him utter dark \nprophecies of the future of Italy and Florence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola became one of the great names of his age. Pietro de Medici \nof Florence was a weak man. Savonarola's allies deposed the \nineffectual tyrant and the priest became the city's effective leader, \nand a gadfly in the side of the corrupt Renaissance Pope, Alexander \nVI. He denounced papal iniquity and took political sides against the \npope. Worst of all, from the Pope's point of view, he called upon \nEurope's leaders to dethrone the pontiff.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexander in turn sought to bring down the puritanical friar who \nspoke with such vehemence against his pleasures and vices. Yet he was \npatient and could bide his time, for he saw that the political tide \nmust soon turn against Savonarola.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a time, Savonarola triumphed. A Florentine republic was formed. \nSavonarola's bullies burned the \"vanities\" of the city-- art works \nand books. No building had sufficient capacity to hold the thousands \nwho came for his sermons. By 1498 all had changed. Poorly conceived \npolicies, by no means all Savonarola's fault, starved the city. Its \ncoffers were empty. Alexander VI threatened interdiction. While many \nof Savonarola's predictions came true, others failed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Florentines turned against the preacher they had lauded. A \nFranciscan challenged Savonarola to an ordeal by fire. Savonarola's \ndisciple Domenico da Pescia accepted as his surrogate. Crowds \ngathered. The Franciscan backed out and used every device to prevent \nthe test. Cheated of their spectacle, the crowds blamed Savonarola. \nThe next day he was arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween April 9th and May 23rd Savonarola was tortured repeatedly and \nforced to recant. Each time, when he recovered from the torments, he \nrenounced his recantations, the last time with such boldness that his \ninterrogators quailed. On this day, May 22, 1498, he was interrogated \none last time. Seeing that he could not be moved, his interrogators \nsent him shackled back to his cell and sentenced him to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sentence was carried out the next day. Savonarola and two friars \nwere hung and burned. Scoffers shouted, \"If you can work miracles, \nwork one now!\" After he was dead, his hand flew up, two fingers \nextended, as if blessing the crowd. The crowd panicked and fled the \nsquare, crushing several children to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFoster, K. \"Savonarola, Girolamo.\" New Catholic Encyclopedia.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke record that Jesus cleansed the \ntemple at the end of his ministry; John says it was at the beginning. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn three of the gospels, the roof throol.lgh which the crippled man \nwas lowered to the feet of Jesus was a typical Palestinian roof made \nof mud and sticks. But in Luke's gospel! the 6entile author wrote \nthat the roof was made of tile, the kind of roof he and his people \nknew. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs Elisha's behavior in 2 Kings 2:23-25 on a par with ANY level of \nGod's standard for behavior - even the 0ld Testament standard? \u0014\n\u0014\nGen. 17:25 records that Ishmael was 13 years old when Isaac was born; \nGen. 21:14-15 indicates Ishmael was only a baby in Hagar's arms when \nshe was driven into the wilderness. \u0014\n\u0014\nLev. 11:6 and Deut. 14:7 are bioiogically untrue. A rabbit does not \nchew his cud. In botany it can be stated for a fact that the mustard \nseed is not the smallest of seeds (Mark 4:21). \u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you agree to the iinerrancy of Psalm 137:9 -- \"Happy shall be \nbe who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock?\" Is \nthis supposed to reflect current behavior? \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the chief reasons Jesus was crucified was because he \nchallenged the verbal inerrancy of his day.\u0014",

Very \ngood, and you're exactly right: Secretariat's Belmont is an outlier. \nThe first  of a mile at quarter horse fractions and the endurance to \nkeep running will keep his record in place for years to come. It may \nnever be broken. That was unheard of, still is and may well be \netched in stone. \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, you're right again---Lord, I hate to keep saying thatRisen Star \nwas the apex of Secretariat's breeding life, nothing like him. \nGeneral Assembly, who looked like Secretariat, was the closest to \nhim. I have the recordings of that (1988) Triple Crown---Winning \nColors et al. For a small fee---and if you will put in on DVD for \nmeI'll share it with you. Yeah! Big Mama got lucky in that derby. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom: John Skaggs [mailto:jskaggs@morningsidecourier.com] \u0014\nSent: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 10:41 AM\u0014\nTo: 'Lauren Ingram'; 'Fred Skaggs'\u0014\nCc: 'John Skaggs'; 'Randy Skaggs'; 'Justin Ingram'; 'Cynthia Rowe'; \n'Rob Reuter'; 'Lindsey Bostic'\u0014\nSubject: RE: Faster than Secretariat\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst thing I noticed was that Secretariat did not go to the lead and \nhold it for the whole race like so many say. The fastest quarter in \nthe '73 Belmont was the second quarter at 22.6 in which Sham and \nSecretariat were in a match race and Sham led by a head and up to \nalmost a half-length, until the  mile mark when Secretariat took \nback the lead by a head. At this point in the 2015 race, Materiality \ngot his head near Pharoah's rump and then Mubtaahij got there about \nthe mile marker and that was the closest any horse got. No serious \nchallenge ever materialized. Secretariat and Sham were their own \nrabbits running, 23.6, 22.6 and 23.6 quarters up to the  pole where \nSecretariat was starting to pull away with a length and a half lead. \nAt the mile, Secretariat had finally slowed to a closer to average \npace and was still faster than Pharoah by 19/100ths of a second at \nthat point. The 5th and 6th quarters for Pharoah were almost  and  \nof a second faster than Secretariat, making his last half a mile 1.25 \nseconds faster than Secretariat. The third and fourth place horse in \nthe 2015 Belmont were almost in the exact same spot as the second and \nthird place finishers in the 1973 Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Pharoah showed he belongs in the Triple Crown champion class and \nis better than many gave him credit for because of the first two \nraces. But then again, he has no horse really challenging him. If he \nis really challenged like Secretariat was in the Belmont, would he \nhave held on or died? Secretariat was tried and proven against Sham \nand other good horses, always pulling away at the end. But the \namazing thing, still, is the first three quarters of the Belmont in \nblazing speed and then the ability to make better than average \nfractions in the last three quarters after having run a rabbit's \nrace. Obviously, all the other horses in the '73 Belmont were burnt \nand couldn't even get close to average splits after trying to stay \nclose to Sham and Secretariat during the first three quarters. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Paharoah and Secretariat ran faster mile and a quarters in the \nBelmont than in their Derby races. Of course, Secretariat's Derby was \na track and race record at 1:59 2/5. His Belmont mile and a quarter \nwas 1:59. Pharoah improved by 0.69 seconds from the derby to a \n2:02.33. Unlike, Secretariat who blew out the first  of a mile and \nremained steady, Pharoah had an average mile for most Belmonts and \nthen really kicked in the last two quarters. Other than the fourth \nquarter which was close to the same, each quarter was faster than the \nnext from start to finish, producing the sixth fastest Belmont behind \nGallant Man ('57), Point Given ('01), Risen Star ('88), A.P. Indy \n('92) and Easy Goer('89).\u0014\n\u0014\nSecretariat's Belmont is an outlier. The first  of a mile at quarter \nhorse fractions and the endurance to keep running will keep his \nrecord in place for years to come. It may never be broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecretariat 22.6 22.6 23.6 24.4 24.8 25\u0014\nPaharoah 24.06 24.77 24.58 24.59 23.34 24.32\u0014\n\u0014\nOne little tidbit I had forgotten and rediscovered in my research was \nthat Risen Star, 4th fastest Belmont was the son of Secretariat, \nwinning by 14  lengths. He also won the Preakness that year. He was \nbeaten in the Derby by Winning Colors, placing third, some say to a \npoor ride sticking him in the back of the pack with too late a run. \nRisen Star also won the Eclipse Award like his dad, Secretariat, and \nhis granddad, Bold Ruler. An yet, more people remember the Derby \nwinner, Winning Colors. Risen Star was hurt in the Belmomt and \nretired to stud.\u0014",

    "title": "STALIN'S DAUGHTER: BY ROSEMARY SULLIVAN--A REVIEW",
    "words": "Thank you Rosemary Sullivan - from bringing Svetlana into my lfe. \u0014\n\u0014\nVacation is a special time for me. I hunker down to read things I \nwould not have the time for given my ordinary time constraints. And \nthis vacation in particular found me reading (I should say devouring) \ntwo very different but powerful and enjoyable books. Both a bit \nlengthy, and both wonderfully rewarding. I wish to recommend them \nboth, and whet your appetite for either just a tad.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough I was reading them simultaneously (along with snatches of 4 or \n5 others) I began and ended first with the very recently released \nStalins Daughter: The Extraordinary and Tumultuous Life of Svetlana \nAlliluyeva  artfully and captivatingly penned by Rosemary Sullivan.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs you might imagine, tracking down details and personages both in \nthe former Soviet Union and in a number of other places around the \nglobe was a monumental task. Collating that material in a narrative \nform that neither misses anything crucial nor allows itself to be \nbogged down in unnecessary detail must have been staggering. \nStaggering just to contemplate, let alone actually accomplish. \nSullivan does it with a keen and insightful eye, sympathy without \ngloss and accuracy without judgmentalism nor cruelty. It is \nreporting of the first order. I could not put it down.\u0014\n\u0014\nI grew to have a strong attraction to this wounded, but mostly \nundaunted and rare creature Svetlana. I wish so much that I could \nhave known her. And that, in the full light that in her brokenness, \nshe could often alienate those who delighted in her most. Not out of \na native cruelty to others as much (at least as it seems to me) as a \ncertain lack of emotional filters never allowed to be cultivated in \nher odd environment and collection of extreme circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe human soul craves. Just as we are born physically hungry, so our \nsouls enter this world hungry. We are, I think, most hungry for 3 \nthings: Affection, Affirmation and Accomplishment. When any or all of \nthese are withheld, or meted out in spasmodic dribbles, they grow to \noverlap one another and become nearly indistinguishable. If \nimbalanced, we can unconsciously let them disproportionately let take \nthe place of each other  trying to fill the void. But because they \nare in fact discreet, they can move into each others room, but never \nactually occupy or fulfill the missing one(s).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the beginning, the myopia of youth assumes the presence of these \neven if they are only there in shadow. As time removes the masks to \nexpose the truth, the disillusionment can be so unsettling as to be \nalmost impossible to recover from. Such is Svetlanas story.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrilliant, but daughter to a cold and distant idealog of a mother - \nwho took her own life when Svetlana was but a little girl (a fact she \nnever learns until she is 19 years of age), and an evil genius of a \nmonstrous father who bears the responsibility for the deaths of 50 \nmillion souls (by some estimate)  that Svetlana survived or \nfunctioned at all is nearly beyond belief. But there she stood  the \nimpossible by-product of this perverse union. And a testament to the \nwonder of what creatures made in the image of God can endure  even \nwhen He is denied and railed against. It makes you gasp.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough her oh so many and painful relationships. Living in the \nartificial bubble of Soviet Socialist elite at its most ruthless and \npowerful. Coming to grips with total unpreparedness to live outside \nof that bubble when at last escaping to the West. Nave in the most \ninteresting ways, and yet equally wise in others. This force of \nhumanity called Svetlana was shaped so profoundly by the fitful \nspurts and drops of affection, that she sought to fill that void over \nand over by any means she could. In time, she would accomplish much \nby her writing, and win the affirmation of many (whilst being \nexcoriated by countless others), but those cannot replace true \naffection no matter what one does. And when youve been virtually \nstarved for true loving affection  and when it has been used as a \nweapon or a means of control for so long  one wonders if you lose \nthe capacity to ever take it in and feed upon rightly at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll I know is, I kept wishing that someone, anyone would take this \nlittle girl and scoop her up in their arms and show her simple, \nunqualified love and affection. I wished it time after time. Scene \nafter scene. Decade after decade. And it seemed none but her own \ndaughter ever really came close. But she needed it from someone other \nthan her daughter as well. And I wept inwardly that it was never so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat does not mean I left the book pitying her. I do not think that \nwas Sullivans point at any time in her writing the book either. \nIndeed, I came away admiring her time after time. I just wanted more \nfor her. Better for her. For she was throughout her life and in the \nend, a truly extraordinary human being. Both tragic and triumphant. \nBut one whom I saw as having appendages of her soul that like \nundeveloped limbs never were allowed to function as fully as they \nought. For all that, those were also part of what made her the \namazing individual she was.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, I think that is what Svetlana really wanted  to simply \nbe her own person. To not have her individuality eclipsed by being \nStalins Daughter. The Kremlins little girl. The United States \nprize defector. A mark for others plans and schemes to be played off \nof for their own purposes. Just to be. But it was not to be so.\u0014\n\u0014\nRosemary Sullivan is to be congratulated above all  for trying to \nmake that a reality for Svetlana though it be posthumously.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a towering work of research and testament to one of the most \nenigmatic and powerful figures of our time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThank you Rosemary Sullivan  for bringing Svetlana Alliluyeva into \nmy life.\u0014\n\u0014\n===================================\u0014\n\u0014\nA child both petted and coldly dominated by one of historys most \nbrutal dictators, Svetlana Alliluyevas life would veer between \npassion and loneliness. As depicted here in a lengthy, deeply \nconsidered biography, she can be seen as a person, but will always \nremain a symbol of the desperation of a former captive to gain and \nenjoy true freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nAward-winning author and poet Rosemary Sullivan (VILLA AIR-BEL, \nLABYRINTH OF DESIRE) takes on the task of bringing this remarkable \njourney into close focus within the colossal panorama of history. \nAlliluyevas infamous father is frozen in collective memory as \nsomeone who could not possibly have been a loving parent, but he did, \nto a limited extent, accord his only daughter a certain gruff \naffection. She retained a sense of her very early years as a happy, \ngolden realm. But after her mothers suicide, the exact truth of the \nincident unknown, the little girl became a servant to paternal whim \nand, like all good servants, strove to please, to avoid punishment \nand scorn.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan --- who interviewed Alliluyevas daughter, Olga (now known \nas Chrese Evans), among many others, and pored through voluminous \narchives --- finds few periods of true contentment in her subjects \n\"extraordinary and tumultuous life\"; perhaps Olga herself was \nresponsible for what tranquility there was. Arguably the 20th \ncenturys most noted defector, Alliluyeva could recall, for example, \nonly one happy hour in her several-year relationship with Olgas \nfather, Wesley Peters. Peters was an American architect who, goaded \nby his overbearing mother, all but forced marriage on Alliluyeva and \nthen systematically leeched away most of the small fortune she had \ngarnered from her autobiography. Their communal lifestyle, based on \nprinciples established by Frank Lloyd Wright, dismayed Alliluyeva, \ndoubtless reminiscent of her childhood in Stalins compound. In her \nlater years, the migrs peregrinations --- to Europe, back to the \nformer Soviet Union, back to the US --- forced penury upon her, most \nof her income spent on Olgas private schooling, while Alluliyeva \nshopped at thrift stores and altered clothes to fit.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Sullivan makes clear is that Stalins daughter was stronger than \nshe knew, ultimately capable of defying her father and others, like \nPeters, who sought to dominate. She knew of many of Stalins \nperfidies (she overheard him planning the auto accident that killed \na Jewish anti-fascist) and carefully plotted to escape the perverse \ngovernance he set in place. She stood up to diplomats and got what \nshe wanted, including life as an American. But behind the bravado \nwere the troubled, eerie moods that Olga described as the night \nterrors of a child alone and lost. One ex-lover described her as a \nslave to her passions; inside the slave, a tyrant always dwells.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan takes care not to draw hard conclusions about this \nremarkable figure. She was brilliant; she was capricious; she sinned \nand was sinned against; she could be bitter at times. In one telling \nincident, near the end of her life, when someone suggested that she \nmight begin to see everyone she had ever known passing before her \ninner eye, Alliluyeva responded, What about the people I dont want \nto see? Yet she developed and maintained a spiritual overview, as \nevidenced by her final letter to Olga: We, who are without bodily \ntraits, only spirits, we love you on Earth nevertheless.\u0014",

    "title": "SCIENCE SUPPORTS GENESIS, GENETICIST SAYS",
    "words": "Science Supports Genesis: Geneticist Says Evidence Confirms \nBiblical Adam and Eve\u0014\nCristian News   7/27/15\u0014\n\u0014\nA respected molecular geneticist explores the historicity of Adam and \nEve in a newly-released documentary, explaining that modern findings \nin the field of genetics confirm the Bibles teachings that all \nhumans descended from an original couple created by God.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Georgia Purdom earned a Ph.D. in molecular genetics from Ohio \nState University and has published papers in a number of scientific \njournals, including the Journal of Neuroscience and the Journal of \nBone and Mineral Research. Formerly a biology professor, Purdom is \nnow a researcher and speaker for the Christian apologetics ministry \nAnswers in Genesis (AiG).\u0014\n\u0014\nSince joining AiG, Purdom has written numerous articles and been \nfeatured in several DVDs and presentations. Her latest work, titled \nThe Genetics of Adam & Eve, examines the Genesis account of \nmankinds origins from the perspective of genetics.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the biggest debates in Christianity today concerns the first \ntwo people: were Adam and Eve real or are they the product of myths? \nPurdom wrote in an article for AiG. Those who claim we have evolved \nover millions of years believe that Adam and Eve, as the Bible \nteaches about them, have no place in human history. They argue that \nthe science of genetics proves we cannot be descended from only two \npeople. Many Christians have accepted this position and propose that \ntheir historical existence is irrelevant to Christianity and the \ngospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview with Christian News Network, Purdom proposed that the \nhistorical existence of Adam and Eve is imperative for a proper \nunderstanding of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nA historical Adam and Eve and original sin are the foundation of the \ngospel, she said. The bad news, sin and death, begins in Genesis 3 \nwhen Adam and Eve sinned.\u0014\n\u0014\nAppreciating that Adam and Eve were real people helps people realize \nthe need for a savior, Purdom explained\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need the good news, grace and life, which is found in the death \nand resurrection of Jesus Christ, she said. Jesus is the solution \nto the problem of evil that began in Genesis 3. Paul made this \nconnection very clear in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nPurdom then detailed some recent genetic findings that support the \nBibles creation account.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most compelling genetic evidences for an original human \ncouple created by God is mitochondrial DNA research done by creation \ngeneticist, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson, she advised. He clearly shows \nthat the common human female ancestor of us all (biblical Eve) lived \nwithin the biblical timeframe of several thousand years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese findings, along with other evidence presented in The Genetics \nof Adam & Eve, directly contradict the claims of evolutionists, said \nPurdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis female ancestor could not have lived 100,000 or more years ago \nas the evolutionists claim, she continued. In addition, genetics \nclearly shows that human and chimps do not share a common ancestor. \nThere are many, many differences in their DNA that completely \nundermine the possibility of shared ancestry only a few million years \nago.\u0014\n\u0014\nPurdom told Christian News Network that Christians should equip \nthemselves with this scientific information, so that they can defend \nthe reliability of the Bible, starting in Genesis.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians should be aware of the scientific proof for creation \nbecause Genesis is the most hotly debated book among evangelical \nChristians, she asserted. We need to show people that science \nsupports and confirms the history presented in Genesis.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: This position is not supported by any recognized geneticists.\u0014",

    "words": "William Walford was blind, but this did not make him worthless. On \nthe contrary, as he sat by the fire in his English home in the \nmid-nineteenth century, his hands kept busy, whittling out useful \nobjects, such as shoehorns. His mind was active, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalled on to preach from time to time in a rural English church, \nWillam Walford composed sermons in his head to deliver on Sundays. He \nmemorized a huge amount of the Bible which he quoted verbatim in his \nsermons. Some of his folk thought he had memorized the entire \nScripture, cover to cover. William also composed lines of verse. And \nhe prayed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Salmon, a New York native, spent some time in Coleshill, \nWarwickshire, England, where he became acquainted with William. He \ntells this tale of what happened one day, while he was visiting the \nblind pastor:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...He repeated two or three pieces which he had composed, and having \nno friend at home to commit them to paper, he had laid them up in the \nstorehouse within. \"How will this do?\" asked he, as he repeated the \nfollowing lines, with a complacent smile touched with some light \nlines of fear lest he subject himself to criticism. I rapidly copied \nthe lines with my pencil, as he uttered them, and sent them for \ninsertion in the Observer, if you should think them worthy of \npreservation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Observer did consider them worth preserving, and they were \npublished on this day, September 13, 1845, becoming a beloved hymn.\u0014\n\u0014\nSweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\u0014\nThat calls me from a world of care,\u0014\nAnd bids me at my Father's throne\u0014\nMake all my wants and wishes known.\u0014\nIn seasons of distress and grief,\u0014\nMy soul has often found relief\u0014\nAnd oft escaped the tempter's snare\u0014\nBy thy return, sweet hour of prayer!\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the fact that he was blind and the few details recorded by \nThomas Salmon, we know little of William Walford.

    "words": "Sharing Christmas Truth During a Season of Excess \u0014\nBill Wilson\u0014\nTuesday, December 22, 2015 \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nEach Advent season, our churches have the opportunity to offer an \nalternative understanding of reality to the American public, Wilson \nobserves. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur current Christmas celebration habits are uniquely post-World War \nII phenomena.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the excess we experience stands at odds with the way Western \nsociety approached the holiday only a few decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis shift has lessons for any congregation attempting to manage \nexpectations and change as they try to embrace the new realities of \nthe 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing their victory during the English Civil War, England's \nPuritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey did so because of the secular nature of the celebration: way too \nmuch alcohol, bands of young men going from house to house demanding \nfood and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nPro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities, and for weeks \nCanterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with \nholly and shouted royalist slogans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe restoration of Charles II in 1660 ended the ban, but many \nclergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn colonial America, the Puritans of New England disapproved of \nChristmas. Celebrating was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681. At \nthe same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed \nthe holiday freely.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoravian settlers in Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz, Pennsylvania, \nand the Wachovia settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic \ncelebrators of Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Moravians in Bethlehem had the first Christmas trees in America \nas well as the first nativity scenes.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas fell out of favor in the U.S. after the American Revolution \nwhen it was considered an English custom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn England, by the 1820s, sectarian tensions had eased and British \nwriters began to worry that Christmas was dying out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese writers imagined Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration, \nand efforts were made to revive the holiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Dickens' book, \"A Christmas Carol,\" published in 1843, played \na major role in reinventing Christmas as a holiday emphasizing \nfamily, goodwill and compassion as opposed to communal celebration \nand hedonistic excess.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn America, interest in Christmas was revived in the 1820s by several \nshort stories by Washington Irving. Irving's stories depicted \nharmonious warm-hearted holiday traditions that were widely imitated \nby his American readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement Clarke Moore's 1822 poem, \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" - \npopularly known by its first line: \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" \n- created great interest in the man in the red suit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poem popularized the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal \nChristmas shopping began to assume economic importance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her 1850 book, \"The First Christmas in New England,\" Harriet \nBeecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true \nmeaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas was eventually declared a U.S. federal holiday in 1870. \nThus, for more than 200 years, the celebration of Christmas ebbed and \nflowed in the life of the average American home as societal forces \nfought for dominance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs there not something here for us to learn about our efforts to find \n21st century relevance and meaning in the life of our congregations?\u0014\n\u0014\nThink about it: Each Advent season, our churches have the opportunity \nto offer an alternative understanding of reality to the American \npublic.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe insist that this time of year is filled with powerful spiritual \nlessons if one is willing to push through the noise and static of \nculture to look beneath the surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a privilege and a joy to be a truth-teller amid the cultural \nlies that surround us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe understand the massive disadvantage we have as we face off against \nthe retail economic engine that drives two-thirds of the American \neconomy. We acknowledge that we speak a word of moderation in a \nseason of excess.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe find meaning in offering an alternative celebration rich in power \nand history, even if it seems seriously outdated. We sing songs \nothers have never heard. We use words that need interpretation. We \ntell stories overlooked by most.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe declare our smallness in this divine story while others revel in \nthe attention they draw to themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt our best, we stand alongside culture and offer a prophetic \ncritique and a reinterpretation of reality they find nowhere else.\u0014",

As the organ played, fear kept creeping in. \nThe night before, my cousin showed me one of the A Nightmare on Elm \nStreet movies. Sweat dripped from my face.

Blood is the \nonly way out of here alive!\u0014\n\u0014\nScenes from the movie kept rushing back. God chased his son down a \ncorridor. Knives extended from Gods fingers. Reaching the corner, \nGod slashed until his son was dead. Shouting out, I rushed to the \nfront. I had to get out of the way of Freddy Krueger or the God that \nmurdered his own son.

    "title": "SEX AND INTIMACY ARE NOT THE SAME THING",
    "words": "I was in a tense meeting once where a denominational official asked a \ncolleague, Were you intimate with that woman? He answered No. The \nofficial thought that settled it, so I had the unpleasant task of \nfollowing up by saying, But did you have sex with her? He had to \nanswer Yes. He was honest in his answers to both questions. Sex \ndoesnt automatically mean intimacy; it just means sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe psycho-social developmental task of young adults is intimacy vs \nisolation. It starts in the teen years, because of puberty, but as \nteens our main task has to be identity vs identity diffusion. [1]\u0014\n\u0014\nNature doesnt care about intimacy. All nature cares about is sex. It \nsimply wants reproduction, so that the species will survive. Nature \nknows, however, that reproduction alone is usually not enough to keep \nthe species going. The young have to be cared for until they can fend \nfor themselves, so nurturing instincts are built into the parents. In \naddition to sex, there can be companionship and caring and feelings \nof loss in the pairings of other species, but those are not really \nintimacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSex for the sake of reproduction, though, or even nurturing of the \nyoung, is not enough for humans. Humans want and need intimacy. We \nare not meant to live in isolation. That is why solitary confinement \nis considered the worst kind of punishment. But intimacy is \nfrightening, because it makes us vulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\nSexuality is the basic urge that pulls us toward intimacy, and also \npropels us away from it. In our fear of the vulnerability of \ncommitment that comes with intimacy, we often treat sex in a very \nsuperficial, non-intimate, way.\u0014\n\u0014\nViolence, of course, is the ultimate protection against intimacy. \nIt is the ultimate isolator.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe urges of both sex and intimacy are so strong in young people that \nthey are overwhelming. Religious young people often try to control \nthose urges by fixating on, ritualizing, a particular belief or \naction. In belief, some theological doctrine like substitutionary \natonement or dating the apocalypse [when the world will end]. In \nactions, examples are ritualistic Bible reading and praying, or \nspeaking in tongues. [2]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe religious impulse propels us toward intimacy, but fixation on a \nreligious concept or ritual helps to wall us off against intimacy. \nIntimacy is a fearful thing. We cannot be intimate without being \nvulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith young preacher types, the underlying problem is often sexual. \nEither shehe is trying to deny homosexuality, more to self than to \nothers, or is afraid of the power of sexual urges and thinks that a \nreligious calling will replace or control those urges. \n[Fortunately, denying homosexuality is not as necessary as it once \nwas.]\u0014\n\u0014\nIn religion, we try to escape intimacy and vulnerability by excluding \nthose unlike us, for there is no real intimacy with ones self, and \nif we only love those who love us, as someone once said, what reward \nis there? There is no intimacy in that, and so no depth. We escape \nintimacy through exclusion and call it righteous, because after all, \nwe claim, it is really God who is doing the excluding and not we \nourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntimacy and isolation are not just internal psychic states that \ndetermine, and result from, out interactions with others. They are \nstances toward the world, open or closed. The Good News of Christ is \nthat intimacy with God, vulnerability to God, is always possible, \nbecause God forgives our attempts at isolation, both to God and to \nothers, and even with our own true selves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a time of shallow sex and gratuitous violence and the attempt, \nliterally as well as psychologically, to build walls to keep others \naway, intimacy even with those closest to us is difficult, for it is \nhard to be intimate personally in a world that says intimacy is too \ndifficult or unnecessary.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery once in a while, I see the statement, often attributed to Tom \nClancy, the late novelist who was in love with military weaponryand \nwhat can be a better wall against intimacy than military weaponsthat \nMoney cant buy you love, but it can buy you sex, and thats almost \nas good.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, it isnt.\u0014",

    "words": "The cross of Christ is what life is all about. \u0014\nWhat Jesus did on that Friday afternoon is the most important act \nanyone ever did. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo help us get into this scene let's look at an eye-witness account \nin John's Gospel, \u0014\nchapter 19, beginning with verse 16. \u0014\n\u0014\nTake a long look at that scene, and then consider the second most \nfamous \u0014\ndeath in history. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs sundown approaches, Socrates must drink the hemlock. The beloved \nsage of \u0014\nthe Athenians has been condemned by the officials for corrupting the \nminds of \u0014\nyouth with new ideas. Meanwhile friends drop by, and Socrates leads a \ndiscussion \u0014\nabout the nature of the soul. He then spins an elaborate myth about \nthe shape \u0014\nof the earth. As the sun sinks below the horizon, in a touching scene \ndescribed \u0014\nby Plato, Socrates says. \"I think it better that I have [a bath] to \nsave the women \u0014\nthe trouble of washing the corpse.\" So he bathes, drinks the poison, \nand scolds his \u0014\nfriends for weeping. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen Socrates lies down and continues teaching as the numbness works \nits way \u0014\nup his legs and finally to his heart, and the great man slips away in \nwhat can \u0014\nonly be described as a noble-perhaps beautiful-death. \u0014\n\u0014\nDon't you wish Jesus had died as did Socrates? \u0014\n\u0014\nBy all accounts, crucifixion was the most hideous means of dying ever \u0014\ndevised by humans. One fact says it all: No one who ever saw a \ncrucifixion \u0014\never drew a picture of Iesus on a cross Rembrandt never saw a \ncrucifixion, and \u0014\nno one who did see one ever could bring him or herself to draw Jesus \non a cross- \u0014\nso says historian Thomas Cahill. That means if you visit Rome today \nand take \u0014\nthe tour down into the catacombs where Christians were hiding in the \nfirst century, \u0014\nwhen people were being crucified, on the walls you would see a lot of \nart.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheologian H. Richard Niebuhr once said that people today want to \u0014\nhear about a \"God without wrath who brings people without sin into a \u0014\nkingdom without judgment through a Christ without a cross.\" That's \ndecaf \u0014\nChristianity-a-Jesus lite.\u0014",

    "title": "SHE DIED TO END YELLOW JACK (YELLOW FEVER)",
    "words": "Clara Maass Died to End Yellow Jack\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nClara Maass was just 25 when she died in Cuba in 1901. In 1976, the \nUnited States issued a stamp commemorating the Lutheran nurse. \nLutherans honor her on this day, August 13, calling her a \"Renewer of \nSociety.\" What did she do to attain these honors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of ten children in a German immigrant family, Clara became \na caring person. She worked as a mother's helper during her high \nschool years, then in an orphanage. At seventeen, she entered the \nnewly opened Christina Trefz Training School of Nurses and was one of \nits first graduates. She must have been very good at what she did, \nfor by the age of 21, she had become the school's head nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, life held out a chance \nof even greater service to Clara. She became a contract nurse with \nthe American armies. Her competent presence was felt in Georgia, \nFlorida, Cuba, and the Philippines. She found herself fighting \nmalaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases more often than \ngunshots wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, the United States set out to find the cause of \"yellow \njack\"-- yellow fever. Clara, having nursed patients with this deadly \ndisease, and she wanted to see it overcome. She volunteered to be \npart of an experiment to understand the fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo rival theories held the field. The first considered yellow fever \nthe result of filthy conditions. The second attributed it to mosquito \nbites.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder experiments conducted by Walter Reed, a team tested both \ntheories. Men lived in filth without exposure to mosquitoes. They did \nnot contract yellow fever. Other subjects offered themselves to be \nbitten by mosquitoes. Some of them came down with fever. One of them \nwas Clara, who contracted a mild case.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas she now immune? Some thought so. Others thought the case was too \nmild to build immunity. On August 14th, 1901, Clara submitted to a \nsecond mosquito bite. Soon she had a bad case of the fever. Ten days \nlater she died. Her case clinched the matter: a mosquito was the \ncarrier of the disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Clara was buried with military honors, no fuss was made over \nher until thirty years later when another nurse stumbled across the \nfacts, researched her story and raised funds for a memorial. Much \nlater, in honor of her brave self-sacrifice, the United States issued \nthe stamp shown here. Clara, by the way, was the first nurse honored \non a U.S. postage stamp. If yellow fever does not threaten the world \ntoday as it did a century ago, it is in part owing to the Christian \ncourage of Clara Maass.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Clara Maass.\" Their Stamp on History. \nhttp://www.stamponhistory.com/people/maass.html\u0014\nDock, Lavinia L and Stewart, Isabel M.

(Be careful of your \nconclusions before you get to the end.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe song Will Campbell did for our minister's group was about a man \nwho lived in the country begging his beautiful redheaded wife to stay \nhome and not go to town. The refrain of each chapter of the story, as \nhe begs every evening and she eventually leaves, is She gave her \nheart to Jethro, but her body to the whole damn town.\u0014\n\u0014\nTom T. Hall later had a hit with that song, but I had never heard it \nbefore. I was really upset with that redhead by the time Will \nfinished the song. I mean, Some of her lovers were strangers.

We were sort of \nintrigued, and wondered if maybe she lived nearby, but mostly we \ncondemned her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing in the Tom T. Hall song lyrics about what Will told \nus next. I just looked them up to be sure. After letting us think \nshallowly for a while, Will explained that the beautiful redhead was \nthe night nurse in the emergency room at the hospital. I suddenly \nrealized that it was Jethro, not his wife, who was being selfish and \nunfaithful, unfaithful to all his neighbors who needed help for their \nafflictions, unfaithful to his wifes calling. He had her all the \nrest of the time, but he did not want to share. She gave her heart to \nJethro, but her body was a gift from God to give to a suffering \nworld, to the whole damn town.\u0014",

    "title": "SCHISM BETWEEN EAST AND WEST BEGAN",
    "words": "Schism \nbetween East and West Began \u0014\n\u0014\nThe division of the Roman Empire into halves was eventually echoed in \nthe church. The break came when Michael Cerularius was Patriarch of \nConstantinople and St. Leo pope in Rome. In 1053, Cerularius \ncirculated a treatise criticizing in strong terms the practices of \nthe Western church. Catholics did not allow their clergy to marry. \nThis was contrary to scripture and tradition, said Cerularius. And \nCatholics used unleavened bread in their Eucharist. But the most \nserious concern was that the Latin church had added the word \n\"filoque\" to the Nicene creed, saying the Holy Spirit proceeded from \nboth Father and Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would seem that this was more political to Leo than religious, as \nit was pressed upon him by the Franks. Cerularius excommunicated all \nbishops of Constantinople who used the Western ritual and closed down \ntheir churches. This incensed Leo. He demanded that Cerularius submit \nto the pope. Any church which refused to recognize the pontiff as \nsupreme was an assembly of heretics, he said--a synagogue of Satan. \nThe Eastern patriarch wasn't about to accept this characterization. \nThe five patriarchs, Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Constantinople \nand Rome were equals in his eyes. The bishop of Rome, as patriarch of \nthe West, was given the courtesy title of \"first among equals\" and in \na tie vote he could make the final determination according to \ntradition. Rome's growing claims to authority were deemed \nunacceptable to the other patriarchs, who believed (and who still \nbelieve) that Christ alone is the head of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo sent legates, headed by an unyielding man, Cardinal Humbert, to \ndiscuss the issues. Before they could complete their mission, Leo \ndied. Humbert was so rude to Cerularius that Cerularius refused to \nspeak with him. Aggravated by this treatment, the legates marched \ninto St. Sophia on this day, July 6, 1054, and placed a bull on the \naltar, excommunicating Cerularius. After this act, Humbert made a \ngrand exit, shaking the dust off his feet and calling on God to judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nCerularius convoked a council and once more blasted Western \npractices. Humbert was anathematized. The Orthodox condemned all who \nhad drawn up the bull. There was no chance of reconciliation between \nthe factions. The once-united Church was now divided into two: \nEastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic. In many areas, Orthodox churches \nsubmitted to Rome while maintaining many of their rites and \ntraditions. These became the Byzantine rite or Uniate churches, which \nstill exist in countries as distant in time and place as the United \nStates.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rift was inevitable. Traditions and doctrine had been diverging \nfor hundreds of years. East and West would be even farther apart \nafter the cruelties of the crusaders, whose violent acts were often \nagainst fellow-believers of the East whom, in ignorance they did not \nrecognize as Christians. The unity of love which Christ had said \nshould mark his followers was broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDawley, Powel Mills. Chapters in Church History.

Horatio had given \nher a homemade diploma. \"Mistress of Arts, Summa Cum Laude, Horatio \nGates Beull College,\" it read.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tProbably Sarah laughed. All through Horatio's years at Dartmouth \nCollege, he had brought home his Latin, Mathematics and philosophy \nbooks and shared everything he learned with Sarah, who was doing all \nshe could to gain an education, despite the restrictions that kept \nher from attending college. She was such a devoted scholar that \nHoratio felt she, too, should be honored. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBorn on this day, October 24, 1788, in Newport, New Hampshire, \nSarah overcame the disadvantage of discrimination against women to \nbecome an internationally respected author, editor and promoter of \ngood causes. She married.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost every American child is familiar with one bit of Sarah's work. \nShe wrote the kindergarten song, \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah was just thirty-five when her lawyer husband, David Hale, died \nof pneumonia. She had four children under seven years of age and a \nfifth on the way. How was she to support herself? David's colleagues \nequipped her with what she needed to engage in a sewing business. \nThey also paid for the publication of a book of her poems. The poems \nsold well enough that Sarah was able to leave off her sewing long \nenough to write a novel. \u0014\n\u0014\nNorthwood dealt with the issue of slavery and was set against a \nbackdrop of the increasing tension between the northern and southern \nstates. It sold well and established Sarah's name. Her book is \nconsidered the first important American novel by a woman. No doubt it \nhelped blaze the trail for Harriet Beecher Stowe's even more famous \nnovel, Uncle Tom's Cabin.\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah was offered an editor's job in Boston. It meant she had to \nleave her children with other family members, but she accepted the \noffer. To the end of her life, she would edit women's magazines, \nincluding Godey's Lady's Book. She broke new ground by featuring the \nwork of American authors, especially women, rather than European \nauthors. In her magazines, Sarah argued strongly that a woman's \nproper sphere was in the home; however, she championed women's \ncolleges and urged that women be given the chance to teach in them. \nShe supported Elizabeth Blackwell's determination to become a \nphysician and argued that single women should be allowed to become \nmissionaries. Sarah did her part for missions, too, serving as an \nofficer in the Women's Union Missionary Society and the Ladies' \nMedical Missionary Society of Philadelphia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Sarah's greatest achievement was to make Thanksgiving a holiday \nin the United States. She used her popular magazines as a forum to \nadvocate this national day of gratitude to God. Sarah worked \ntirelessly towards this goal for over fifteen years before Lincoln \nissued his Thanksgiving Proclamation in August, 1863. Not a bad track \nrecord for a girl educated at home, largely by her own efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe retired when she was ninety, writing \"I must bid farewell to my \ncountrywomen, with the hope that this work of half a century may be \nblessed to the furtherance of their happiness and usefulness in their \nDivinely-appointed sphere.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nLinton, Adelin.

She \nspent her younger years \"tearing around\" with a bunch of men and \nnever actually settled down. One of the men was Fredrik, who wanted a \ncommitted relationship from her when they were younger. He truly \nloved her. She turned down his proposal because she was not yet ready \nto be \"on the ground.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later, they find each other. Fredrik has a very young and very \nbeautiful (but very naive) wife. Desiree decides that she is going to \nseduce him and win him back because she is finally ready to give up \nall of her little affairs and settle down. She invites him to her \nmother's enormous estate in the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch to her dismay, when she asks him if he will share with her a \n\"coherent existence after so many years of muddle,\" he actually says \nno. He loves Desiree when his eyes are open, but when his eyes are \nnot open -- which is most of the time -- he loves his young wife.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Send in the Clowns\" is Desiree's response to this rejection. She is \ndisgusted with herself for having turned down his overtures when she \nwas younger, but she is also bemused by the absurd irony. Since she \nis a person of the theater, she is used to having comedic moments \n(clowns) sent in to save a show that is failing. She says \"send in \nthe clowns\" because she feels that the situation is so devastating \nand ridiculous that \"there ought to be clowns.\" But there are already \nclowns -- She and Fredrik are the clowns; the fools. After she sings \n\"Don't bother -- they're here,\" Fredrik apologizes to her and leaves \nthe room.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe sings the last verse to herself. She is laughing at herself and \ncrying for herself at the same time. Desiree, the \"one who keeps \ntearing around,\" has lost her youthful mask. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hinting of a circus analogy is perfect - I picture the trapeze \nartist above it all in her own world, leaving the people on the \nground behind in her search for new thrills. Then the high flyer \ngrows weary of being up there alone and finally comes down looking \nfor company, only to find that the one who has been waiting for her \non the ground has flown away himself. All the while the clowns are \nback stage ready to rush out and save the show when someone falls.\u0014",

    "words": "Swat, my first baby, unexpectedly left us today at 1:40pm. He came \ninto my life 13 years ago. I picked him up from a shelter in LA where \nI had to wager against others to get him! Upon taking him home he \nbarked, yes barked. Kristy can confirm it. I think that he's acted \nlike a dog ever since. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe tested his swimming skills by jumping into the pool at Steve and \nmy apartment complex. Over the years he has brought me and my \nroommates and family much joy, and many \"presents\" by the likes of \nbunnies, moles, mice, birds, chipmunks, and one flying squirrel. \u0014\n\u0014\nSwat has road tripped from LA to DC. Lived in 5 homes. Battled \nagainst dogs, big and small, including pit bulls (Kelly, Matt, \nBilly). In some cases attacking them first. And even survived a snake \nbite. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I would come home from work Swat would greet me when I would \npull into the driveway. I hope to have this happen when we meet \nagain. Swat, you were loved deeply. You were fun, affectionate, and \ngentle to everyone. Lauren, Declyn, and I will miss you very much! We \nlove you!\u0014\n-----------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nLauren Collier Ingram Friends, thank you for all of these encouraging \nwords. If means so much as we cope with the loss. \u0014\n\u0014\nI would like to take a minute to add some of my favorite Swat \nmemories to Justin Ingram's post. \u0014\n\u0014\nSwat was a big cat weighing in at 14lbs, but he had a larger than \nlife personality to go with it. He was a bit skeptical of how I would \nfit into the bachelor life he lived with Justin Ingram, and he did \nhis best to test my nerve and reflexes on the regular. He brought in \nall sorts of live creatures (baby bunnies, mice, chipmunks) just to \nwatch me squirm. He regularly attempted to kill me by running in \nbetween my legs as I navigated down stairs in high heels. He \nconstantly meowed at the top of his lungs to announce his entrance \ninto a room (even in the dead of the night). He rejoiced at the \nchance to exercise his ninja kitty abilities and teach a dog a \nlesson. It became habbit for him to make flying leaps off of our \ndressers onto me while I slept and waking me in a panicked and \nsurprised state. When we moved into our new house, he was banned from \nthe bedroom because I now had a baby keeping me awake all night, and \nI couldn't deal with his shenanigans too. That didn't stop him from \ntrying to sneak in though, and on occasion he could actually open the \ndoor on his own if he jumped up and hit the knob the right way. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis cat was incredible. He was smart, sassy, sweet, playful, and \nmost of all VERY loved. I spent almost 8 years relentlessly trying to \ntrain this unruly but super cuddly beast. Now, I will finally have to \nadmit my defeat. You won, Swat. I was just a pawn in your plan. You \nalways had the upper hand. We were so lucky to have you. I have some \npretty vivid memories of your silly antics, but my favorite memories \nwill always be of you and Declyn. You would let her do anything to \nyou. You even let her attempt to ride you like a pony. You were a \ngreat family cat, and your presence is already greatly missed. Rest \nIn Peace little guy.\u0014",

    "words": "Separate but Equal for Richard Allen\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nTo one accomplishes anything worthwhile without overcoming \ndifficulties. In becoming America's first black bishop, Richard Allen \nfaced formidable obstacles. He was born a slave. This meant he had to \nfight racism and inequity every step of his way. He did not \nautomatically receive an education. Whatever he undertook required \nhis master's permission. Slavery's cruelties touched his life. To pay \ndebts, Richard's master sold off Richard's mother and three of her \nchildren. Richard never heard from them again.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt age seventeen, Allen met Christ. \"I was awakened and brought to \nsee myself, poor, wretched and undone, and without the mercy of God \nmust be lost. Shortly after, I obtained mercy through the blood of \nChrist. . .I was brought under doubts, and was tempted to believe I \nwas deceived, and was constrained to seek the Lord afresh. . .I was \ntempted to believe there was no mercy for me. I cried to the Lord day \nand night. . .all of a sudden my dungeon shook, and glory to God, I \ncried. My soul was filled. I cried, enough for me--the Savior died.\" \nHe saw himself as a human being loved by God and it transformed his \noutlook. He became a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. To \nprove the merits of Christianity to his master he worked doubly hard. \nHis master came under conviction. Indebtedness did not allow him to \nfree Allen outright; however he offered to let him buy his freedom. \nWorking evening and weekend jobs, Allen saved up his liberation \nmoney. An inward urge propelled him to educate himself. By 1782 he \nhad become licensed to preach. Four years later he bought his \nfreedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Delaware, where he had been a slave, he moved to Philadelphia. \nThere he preached to blacks in an established Methodist church. But \nwhen the church engaged in outrageous discrimination, he determined \nto form an independent Methodist body. The result was the Bethel \nChurch, founded in 1787 in Philadelphia. Francis Asbury dedicated its \nstructure a few years later and ordained Richard a deacon. Later \nAllen became America's first black Methodist bishop. Black churches \nacross the Eastern United States organized on this day, April 9, 1816 \ninto a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church and \nelected Richard Allen Bishop of that organization.\u0014\n\u0014\nHumble before Christ, Allen was charitable even to the whites who \noppressed him. He was a driving force in founding America's first \nblack convention and was active in the underground railroad. His \nstory is one of great adversities boldly overcome in the strength of \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Allen, Richard.\" Biographical Dictionary of Evangelicals.

    "title": "SAVONAROLA'S PREACHING GOT HIM BURNED - 1498",
    "words": "Today tourists by the thousands travel to Florence, Italy to view the \nglorious art of the Renaissance. Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, \nMachiavelli, Boccacio, Ghiberti, Raphael -- they all painted, wrote, \nor sculpted in this Italian city. Their works are the treasures of \nFlorence. Yet, when Jerome Savonarola (1452-1498) looked at \nRenaissance Florence, the beauty, glory, and grandeur created by the \nartists were overshadowed by the decadence, corruption, and moral rot \nthere.\u0014\n\u0014\nPassionate Preaching, Powerful Predictions\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Medici family of Florence were the great art patrons who had \nbeautified their city with art still admired as among the world's \nbest. When Savonarola, a Dominican friar, came to Florence in the \n1480's, Lorenzo de Medici, the Magnificent, was in the last years of \nhis life. Savonarola shook the population by his sermons from \nRevelation, warning of the wrath to come. Tears came to the \nlisteners' eyes as they also heard his tender assurances of God's \nmercy. In warning of coming judgment, Savonarola also predicted the \nimpending deaths of Lorenzo de Medici, the pope, and the king of \nNaples.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1491 Savonarola was elected prior of St. Mark's convent in \nFlorence. The convent had been enriched by the Medicis, and it was \nconsidered the duty of the new superior to pay homage to Lorenzo. But \nSavonarola refused. He said his election was from God, not the \nMedicis!\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Easy Absolution\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin a few months Lorenzo lay on his deathbed. Oppressed by his \nsins, he called for Savonarola to absolve him. Savonarola promised \nLorenzo absolution on three conditions. First, he should repent and \nhave faith in God's mercy. Lorenzo readily agreed. Second, he should \ngive up his ill-gotten wealth. Lorenzo was more reluctant on this \none, but did agree. Finally, he should restore the republican \nliberties of Florence. At this Lorenzo turned his face to the wall \nand did not reply. Savonarola left without absolving the ruler. \nShortly after Lorenzo died, Pope Innocent VIII also died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe infamous Cardinal Borgia was elected Pope Alexander VI. In one of \nhis sermons Savonarola told of seeing a hand appearing in the sky \nbearing a flaming sword with the words, \"Behold the sword of the Lord \nwill descend suddenly and quickly upon the earth.\" He warned of \njudgment for sins and mercy to the faithful. The pope had reason to \nbe concerned!\u0014\n\u0014\nDramatic Changes at Florence\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the French King Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494, the Medici \nrulers fled. Through negotiation Savonarola was able to prevent King \nCharles from sacking Florence and used his influence to move the city \ntowards a more godly government. Like Calvin later in Geneva, \nSavonarola never held political office, but his sermons heavily \ninfluenced the city government. Some reforms were immediate -- relief \nwas brought to the starving population, shops were opened to give \nwork to the unemployed, a bank was established for charitable loans \nand taxes were reduced. All people were exhorted to place their trust \nin the Lord. Two key ideas in Savonarola's Florence were that \ngovernment by one man would become tyrannical and the very new idea \nthat the people were the source of power, with the right to elect \nmagistrates.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola wanted Florence to be a Christian republic with God as \ngovernor. The Gospel would be the basis of law, and the council \npassed strong regulations against vice, frivolity, gambling, and \nextravagant dress. Many of Savonarola's sermons were based on the Old \nTestament prophets and Revelation. He maintained that his mission was \nto warn people of the coming day of judgment.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Bonfire of the Vanities'\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola had a great appeal to the children of Florence. Boys who \nhad once roamed the streets creating mayhem and throwing rocks at \nhouses were organized into a kind of sacred military, marching \nthrough the city singing hymns and taking collections for the poor. \nDuring the carnival season, they went from house to house and \ncollected trinkets, cosmetics, luxury items, and obscene books to be \nburned on the last day of the carnival. A huge \"bonfire of vanities\" \nwas created in the public square -- sixty feet high with a forty foot \ncircumference at its base. There was great enthusiasm for the changes \nSavonarola brought to Florence -- but apparently not enough \nregeneration of hearts. The people soon turned on the reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWant to Be a Cardinal?\u0014\nPope Alexander VI wanted to silence Savonarola's denunciations of the \ncorruption and immorality in the church and offered to make him a \ncardinal. Savonarola refused the offer. The Pope finally condemned \nSavonarola for announcing he was a special messenger from God and \nexcommunicated him. Savonarola unsuccessfully tried to bring together \na convention of European leaders to remove the decadent Borgia from \nthe papacy. The Florentine crowd turned on Savonarola. He was \nimprisoned and severely tortured on the rack. On one day alone he was \ndrawn up by ropes fourteen times and then suddenly dropped.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the face of death, Savonarola prayed, \"O Lord, a thousand times \nhave you wiped out my iniquity. I do not rely on my own \njustification, but on thy mercy.\" In between his tortures, he wrote \nmeditations on Psalms 32 and 51, which Martin Luther later published, \ncalling them \"a piece of evangelical testing and Christian piety.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola was hanged and then burned at a stake on May 23, 1498. As \nthe bishop stripped him of his priestly garb, he said, \"I separate \nthee from the church militant and from the church triumphant.\" \nSavonarola replied, \"That is beyond your power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SAVO'S WORLD?\u0014\nSavonarola lived in a time that was in many ways like our own. It was \nan age of great discoveries, extraordinary artistic and \ncommunications achievements, the emergence of new views of the world, \ngreat self-consciousness and pride in human achievement. It was also \nan age of restlessness in the world of faith and religion that was \nbound to erupt sooner or later. Here are just some of the many great \npeople and momentous events during the years Savonarola lived \n(1452-1498):\u0014\n\u0014\n1452 - Savonarola born; Ghiberti completed his magnificent bronze \ndoors at Florence baptistery; Leonardo da Vinci born \u0014\n1453 - Gutenberg prints the Mazarin Bible at Mainz; Turks convert \nConstantinople's magnificent St. Sophia into a mosque\u0014\n1455 - Painter Fra Angelico born\u0014\n1456 - Trial of Joan of Arc annulled\u0014\n1465 - Erasmus born 1469 - Lorenzo de Medici begins rule of Florence \nwhich ended in 1492; Niccolo Machiavelli born\u0014\n1473 - Birth of Nicolaus Copernicus\u0014\n1477 - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales published by William Caxton\u0014\n1478 - Birth of Thomas More\u0014\n1480 - Inquisition against Jews begins in Spain\u0014\n1481 - Botticelli and others paint frescoes in Rome's Sistine Chapel\u0014\n1483 - Martin Luther born\u0014\n1492 - Columbus' voyage to the New World; Spain conquers Granada, \nending kingdom of Moors\u0014\n1493 - Pope Alexander VI issues a \"bull\" dividing New World between \nSpain and Portugal \u0014\n1494 - Charles VIII invades Italy; Pope Alexander VI takes refuge in \nCastel Sant' Angelo\u0014\n1495-98 - Da Vinci paints Last Supper \u0014\n1498 - Michelangelo completes \"Pieta\" sculpture in St. Peter's, Rome\u0014\n\u0014\nIn His Own Words\u0014\n\u0014\n[Savonarola spoke out most strongly against the corrupt clergy of his \nday, especially those in Rome]\u0014\n\u0014\nIn these days, prelates and preachers are chained to the earth by the \nlove of earthly things. The care of souls is no longer their concern. \nThey are content with the receipt of revenue. The preachers preach to \nplease princes and to be praised by them. They have done worse. They \nhave not only destroyed the Church of God. They have built up a new \nChurch after their own patter. Go to Rome and see! In the mansions of \nthe great prelates there is no concern save for poetry and the \noratorical art. Go thither and see! Thou shalt find them all with the \nbooks of the humanities in their hands and telling one another that \nthey can guide men's souls by means of Virgil, Horace, and \nCicero....The prelates of former days had fewer gold miters and \nchalices, and what few they possessed were broken up and given to \nrelieve the needs of the poor. But our prelates, for the sake of \nobtaining chalices, will rob the poor of their sole means of support. \nDost thou not know what I would tell thee! What doest thou, O Lord! \nArise, and come to deliver thy Church from the hands of devils, from \nthe hands of tyrants, from the hands of iniquitous prelates (quoted \nin Philip Schaff. History of the Christian Church. VI, p. 688).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not difficult to see why he incurred the wrath of Rome. He \nspoke of Pope Boniface VIII as wicked and beginning his pontificate \n\"like a fox and ending it like a dog.\" Speaking of the seat of all \niniquity, he said: It begins in Rome where the clergy make mock of \nChrist and the saints; yea, are worse than Turks and worse than \nMoors. They traffic in the sacraments. They sell benefices to the \nhighest bidder. Have not the priests in Rome courtesans and grooms \nand horses and dogs? Have they not palaces full of tapestries and \nsilks, of perfumes and lackeys? Seemeth it, that this is the Church \nof God?\u0014\n\u0014\nSAVONAROLA AND SALVATION BY GRACE\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola differed from Wycliffe, Hus, and Luther in that he never \nquarreled with the theology of the Roman Catholic Church. He was more \nof a moral reformer than a theologian. Yet, as seen in the following \nquote, he grasped the biblical understanding of justification by \nfaith that would be more fully developed by later Reformers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola said: \u0014\n\u0014\nWe must regenerate the Church ... God remits the sins of men, and \njustifies them by his mercy. There are as many compassions in heaven \nas there are justified men upon earth; for none are saved by their \nown works. No man can boast of himself; and if, in the presence of \nGod, we could ask all these justified sinners -- Have you been saved \nby your own strength? - all would reply as with one voice, 'Not unto \nus, O Lord! not unto us; but to thy name be the glory!' -- Therefore, \nO God, do I seek thy mercy, and I bring not unto thee my own \nrighteousness; but when by thy grace thou justifies one, then thy \nrighteousness belongs unto me; for grace is the righteousness of God. \n-- O God, save me by thy righteousness, that is to say, in thy Son, \nwho alone among men was found without sin! (quoted in J. H. Merle \nD'Aubigne's History of the Reformation. Vol. 1, pp. 96-97)\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola, like most Christian Reformers, gave special emphasis to \nthe authority of the Bible. He commented: \"I preach the regeneration \nof the church, taking the Scriptures as my sole guide.\"\u0014",

    "title": "SALLMAN'S HEAD OF CHRIST",
    "words": "You may not recognize his name off the cuff, but you've probably seen \nhis work. Warner Sallman was the best-known Christian artist of the \nearly twentieth century. Almost everyone has seen a reproduction of \nhis Head of Christ. The yellow-brown picture with long flowing hair \nwas an icon of the forties and fifties.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day, April 30, 1892, Sallman showed early artistic \ntalent. His Swedish-born parents did all they could to develop his \nabilities. Going to New York City to make his living, he was thwarted \nwhen his trunk came up missing. Without the portfolio samples in it, \nno studio would accept him. He prepared to leave New York, but made \none last check at the railroad station, insisting on seeing the \nstorage area. His trunk was discovered far from sight.\u0014\n\u0014\nSallman was a Christian who had been converted at sixteen during \nevangelistic services in Chicago. \"My burden of sin and guilt was \nremoved and I shall never forget the thrilling joy of that moment of \nexperiencing God's redeeming grace. Since that time my life has been \nbased on that experience, and has been directed toward serving God in \nevery way.\" He married a Christian girl, too--Ruth Anderson--but a \nyear later he was told that he had just three months to live. His \nwife's faith was equal to the test; she said, \"Let us pray about it \nand let the Lord have His way in the matter.\" In time he fully \nrecovered from tuberculosis. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually he achieved success as a professional illustrator. One day \nSallman urgently needed to get a cover done for the February, 1924 \nissue of the religious magazine Covenant Companion. He wanted to do a \nface of Christ, but wasn't satisfied with his ideas. Hovering in the \nback of his mind was a statement by E. O. Sellers, the night director \nof Moody Bible Institute, \"...make Him a real man. Make Him rugged, \nnot effeminate. Make Him strong and masculine, not weak, so people \nwill see in his face He slept under the stars, drove the money \nchangers out of the temple, and faced Calvary in triumph.\" No small \ntask! Little wonder Sallman was unable to find precisely the right \nidea at first.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith his deadline looming, he saw a vision early one morning of the \nface he must draw. He went up to his studio and made a sketch. Years \nlater he converted that sketch to a painting--the best-known \nrepresentation of Christ done in the twentieth century. \u0014\n\u0014\nSallman would do much other religious art--he was the artist for New \nTribes mission, for example. But it was the Head people wanted. He \nsketched it over and over--more than 500 times--in public talks. He \nwould make the sketch and invite people to meet the Christ he tried \nto portray. He made many other paintings about Christ, including the \nwell-known Jesus, Our Pilot and Christ Knocking at Heart's Door (in \nwhich the light radiates from Christ and reflects off the house so \nthat it forms the image of a heart).\u0014\n\u0014\nHighbrow critics scoffed at the works. To them it was mere kitsch. \nBut when one looks at the paintings that they approved, one cannot \nhelp but feel that the sensibility of the masses, while not perfect, \nwas more satisfactory than the verdict of the smug art world.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith changing times, Sallman's ideal of Christ fell into disfavor. \nMinorities reject it because it makes Jesus too white. From the \nperspective of the twenty-first century it is safe to say that what \nappeared masculine to his contemporaries seems effeminate today. One \ncan also take exception with his Head of Christ on the grounds that \nit makes Jesus too beautiful. The Bible says there was nothing comely \nin his appearance to make him desirable.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nLundboom, Jack R. Master Painter; Warner E. Sallman.

    "title": "SEXUALITY AND THE BLACK CHURCH   ( A BOOK REVIEW)",
    "words": "Sexuality and the Black Church: A Womanist Perspective Paperback  \nMarch 1, 1999 \u0014\n\u0014\nby Kelly Brown Douglas \u0014\n\u0014\nA review by Steven H Propp   on March 22, 2016 \u0014\n\u0014\nKelly Brown Douglas is Professor of Religion at Goucher College, and \nis also an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church. She formerly \ntaught theology at Brown University. She is also the author of The \nBlack Christ,Black Bodies and the Black Church: A Blues Slant, and \nWhat's Faith Got to Do With It?: Black Bodies/Christian Souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe wrote in the Introduction to this 1999 book, Sometimes a person \nchooses a subject, and other times a subject chooses a person. This \nissue of Black sexuality chose me. How did it happen?... Renee Hill, \none of my friends and theological colleagues rightly observed that \nher womanist theological colleagues had imprudently ignored the issue \nof sexuality At the time of her critique, neither I nor any other \nwomanist religious scholar had given any sustained consideration to \nissues of homophobia/heterosexism or any other issue related to Black \nsexuality. What was going on?... Why were we womanist theologians so \ndisinclined to confront the oppression of lesbians or  the presence \nof homophobia/heterosexism within the Black community? Alice Walkers \ndefinition [of womanism] clearly affirmed the importance of human \nsexuality Why were our voices so quiet, virtually mute, when it came \nto matters of sexuality?...\u0014\n\u0014\nThese concerns became even more pressing for me as events in my \npersonal life unfolded. Over the last several years I have lost \nnumerous close friends to complications from HIV/AIDS No loss had \nany greater impact upon my life and theology than that of my oldest \nand closest friend, whom I called Cousin Lloyd it was through my \nrelationship with Lloyd that I really began to recognize the \nalienation experienced by Black people living with HIV/AIDS in \nrelation to the Black church and wider Black community Because Lloyd \nwas quite simply one of the best human beings I have ever had the \npleasure of knowing I cannot be a silent bystander and permit black \nchurch people to condemn him and other gay and lesbian persons, \nconsigning them to death by way of AIDS\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the sake of Lloyd and others like him, I had to broaden my \ntheological discussion I had to know more about Black sexuality. It \nwas then that the felt the call of God. What, I wondered, might the \nGod of Jesus Christ be saying to me, a Black female, a womanist \ntheologian, and the rest of the Black community about matters of \nsexuality, especially that of Black women and men?... This particular \nproject attempts to heed the challenge of HIV/AIDS, \nhomophobia/heterosexism, and most significantly of all people by \nshattering the silence concerning Black sexuality in general\u0014\n\u0014\n[This books] purpose is threefold: (1) to understand why sexuality \nin general has been a taboo subject for the Black church and \ncommunity; (2) to advance womanist discourse on Black sexuality; and \n(3) to promote the kind of theological discourse and analyses that \nmight nurture healthier attitudes and behaviors toward sexually \nrelated concerns within the Black church and community, especially \nconcerns about homophobia/heterosexism I only hope through this work \nto provoke the kind of sustained analysis, discourse, attitudes, and \nbehaviors that will move ALL Black women and men closer to enjoying \nthe fullness and uniqueness of their humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe states, It is necessary for White society to control Black \npeoples sexuality, meaning their bodies and reproductive capacities, \nso as to control them as a people. It is also necessary to impugn \nBlack sexuality in order to suggest that Black people are inferior \nbeings. (Pg. 23) Later, she summarizes, White societys \npreoccupation with Black womens and mens sexuality is about more \nthan fascination and fear. It has to do with maintaining the status \nquo of White power in American society. (Pg. 29)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe suggests, Black women were helplessly trapped in the mythology \nof being Jezebels by the very institution that demanded them to be \nprecisely that. The more entrenched the Jezebel image became, the \neasier it was to justify treating Black women in inhumane ways. Once \nenslaved females were considered Jezebels, then all manner of \ntreatment of them was deemed appropriate. They could be worked \nbrutally in the fields, displayed on public auction blocks like \ncattle, and exploited as breeders. (Pg. 39) Later, she adds, The \nsignificance of Jezebel and Mammy to the institution of slavery, and \nmore especially to White patriarchal power, shows why these images \nare to central to White culture and thus so persistent and abiding. \nBy distorting the sexuality of Black women, White culture effectively \ndehumanized them In essence, the Jezebel and Mammy images crafted in \nWhite culture allowed White people to cruelly exploit Black female \nbodies with relative impunity. (Pg. 44)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe says, The Black welfare mother/queen is portrayed as one who, \nlike Jezebel, is most suited for breeding children While the \noffspring of the Jezebels were beneficial to the economy, the \noffspring of the welfare mothers are seen as detrimental. Therefore, \njust as White society attempted to regulate the reproductive capacity \nof enslaved woman, it too has attempted to intervene in the \nreproductive capacities of the welfare mother. (Pg. 53)\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter quoting from Toni Morrisons Beloved, she comments, If the \nBlack community could communicate such a message, Black women and \nmen, especially the young, could unabashedly celebrate their sensual \nand corporeal selves and Black teenagers would no doubt be less \nlikely to engage in self-destructive, self-hating behaviors. Without \nresistance, the discourse of White culture will continue to succeed \nin wreaking havoc on the bodies and minds of Black people. Black \nself-esteem will continue to fall prey too easily to White cultures \nhistorical and consistent sexual degradation of Black men and women. \n(Pg. 76)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe suggests, the Bible does not present as clear a positon on \nhomosexuality as is often self-righteously asserted. The meaning of \nthe biblical stories customarily referred to as proof against \nhomosexual practices have generally been misconstrued or distorted \nneither the words nor the actions of Jesus, as recorded in the \nGospels, suggest an antigay or antilesbian stance. In fact, the New \nTestament shows Jesus to be virtually indifferent about matters of \nsexuality Given the Bibles unclear view, to use the Bible to \nsupport a position on homosexuality would seem untenable. (Pg. 90)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe proposes, The Black communitys sexual discourse against \nhomosexuality does not save Black lives, but rather helps White \nculture to destroy them A sexual discourse of resistance could \nnurture the kind of discussion that promotes acceptance and \nappreciation of the rich diversity---even sexual diversity---within \nthe Black community. It would empower Black men and women to disavow \nany dismantle any structures, systems, or ways of behaving or \nthinking that in any way foster homophobia. (Pg. 107) Later, she \nadds, A fundamental theological task of the Black Christian \ncommunity  is to  disavow disembodied interpretations of the \nincarnation by pointing to Gods concrete existence. (Pg. 118)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe concludes, human sexuality must be viewed as a gift from God it \nis significant to the human capacity to show forth the image of God \nAnything less than a positive acceptance of human sexuality heralds a \nfaulty conception of what it means to be created in the image of the \nGod revealed in Jesus Christ. (Pg. 121) Furthermore, whenever Black \nmen and women  love others in a human, loving community, then God is \nFULLY Black and blackness is FULLY God. Blackness is not an affront \nto God. It is a fitting existential witness to Gods embodied \npresence in history. (Pg. 124-125)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe asserts, Given Black womens significant presence within Black \nchurches, if they demanded discourse relating to matters of Black \nsexuality, Black churches would have to consent, in order to survive. \nWithout a doubt, when Black women are empowered and enabled to affirm \nthe fullness of their humanity, the entire Black community will be \ncloser to keeping faith with Gods radical disclosure in Jesus. (Pg. \n138) She ends, to render sexuality a taboo issue is, in effect, to \npreclude the possibility of knowing the full measure of Gods \nintimate presence and activity in human history Only when the veil \nof silence surrounding Black sexuality is lifted will Black men and \nwomen be able to realize the liberating significance of what it means \nfor the God of Jesus Christ to have chosen them. (Pg. 143)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a very rich, thought-provoking and challenging book about an \narea often not discussed openly. It will be must reading for \nWomanists, Black theologians, those interested in the Black church or \nBlack Studies in general, as well as the LGBT community.\u0014",

    "title": "SATCHEL PAIGE - A BASEBALL LEGEND",
    "words": "It is estimated that Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige was born on July 7, 1906. \nThe mere idea that his birthday is an estimate provides perfect \nevidence to the mystery that was Satchel Paige. In 1965, 60 years \nafter Paige's supposed birthday, he took the mound for the last time, \nthrowing three shutout innings for the Kansas City Athletics. \u0014\n\u0014\n Joe DiMaggio called Satchel Paige \"the best and fastest pitcher I've \never faced\". His pitching was amazing and his showboating was \nlegendary. His career highlights span five decades. Pronounced the \ngreatest pitcher in the history of the Negro Leagues, Paige compiled \nsuch feats as 64 consecutive scoreless innings, a stretch of 21 \nstraight wins, and a 31-4 record in 1933. For 22 years, Paige mauled \nthe competition in front of sellout crowds. Sure, he liked the \nattention, but to him, there was only one goal. That goal would be to \npitch in the Major Leagues. \u0014\n\u0014\n In 1948, Paige's dream came true. The Cleveland Indians were in need \nof extra pitching for the pennant race. Legendary Bill Veeck tested \nPaige's accuracy before offering him a big league contract. As the \nstory is told, Veeck placed a cigarette on the ground to be used as a \nhome plate. Paige took aim at his virtually nonexistent target. He \nfired five fastballs, all but one sailing directly over the \ncigarette. Veeck was indeed pleased, and Paige helped the Indians win \nthe pennant.\u0014\n\u0014\n In addition to Cleveland, Paige played for St. Louis and Kansas \nCity. When his Major League career was completed, he compiled a \nmodest 28-31 record with a 3.29 ERA. He also served as coach for the \nAtlanta Braves in 1968. What made Paige so memorable was his \nlongevity in the game. The main reason his age was so difficult to \ntrack was his seemingly endless success. He rarely answered questions \nabout his age, and when he did, he replied with something like: \"Age \nis a question of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't \nmatter.\"  Paige did not commit a single error in 179 major league \ngames. \u0014\n\u0014\n In 1971, Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige was given the ultimate honor, he was \nelected to join the very best in baseball history in the Hall of Fame.\u0014\n\u0014\nSATCHEL PAIGE QUOTES:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Age is a question of mind over matter. If you dont mind, it doesnt \nmatter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I ain't ever had a job, I just always played baseball.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't generally like running.

See, they can't start the game without me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I use my single windup, my double windup, my triple windup, my \nhesitation windup, my no windup. I also use my step-n-pitch-it, my \nsubmariner, my sidearmer and my bat dodger.

But the \nmore I pitched, the stronger my arm would get.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When a batter swings and I see his knees move, I can tell just what \nhis weaknesses are then I just put the ball where I know he can't hit \nit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Aint no man can avoid being born average, but there aint no man \ngot to be common.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I never threw an illegal pitch. The trouble is, once in a while I \nwould toss one that aint never been seen by this generation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. \nHome plate dont move.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They said I was the greatest pitcher they ever sawI couldnt \nunderstand why they couldnt give me no justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Don't look back.

What American \nminister succeeded Jonathan Edwards as President of Princeton \nUniversity? The answer to both questions is Samuel Davies.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel was born on this day, November 3, l723. Evidently, his Baptist \nmother had difficulty conceiving, for years later Samuel wrote, \"I am \na son of prayer, like my namesake Samuel the prophet; and my mother \ncalled me Samuel because, she said, 'I have asked him of the \nLord...'\" In that same letter, he remarked that \"the most important \nblessings of my life I have looked upon as immediate answers to the \nprayers of a pious mother.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavies was determined to make life count for God. In l740, although \nVirginia's colonial government discriminated against denominations \nother than the official Church of England, it gave Davies a license \nto preach as a Presbyterian minister in four counties, and he used it \nto promote tolerance for all denominations. The persuasive reasoning \nof Davies' eloquent sermons electrified his audiences by combining \nScripture with practical teaching. The patriot orator, Patrick Henry \nfrequently attended Davies' services, and learned some of his \neloquence from him. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavies also regularly invited three hundred slaves to his home on \nSaturday evenings--their only free time. He taught them to read and \nto sing hymns, many of which he wrote himself. His \"Great God of \nWonders\" and other gospel songs are still found in hymn-books.\u0014\n\u0014\nRealizing the importance of education, Davies helped found Princeton \nUniversity, and was chosen its president after Jonathan Edward's \nsudden death. Yet Davies, too, soon died--at the early at age \nthirty-eight. Like the Old Testament prophet after whom he was named, \nthis eighteenth century Samuel dedicated his life to serving his God \nand his country. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nNinde, Edward S.

Are we obliged to love \nevery human being, \u0014\n         even those who do great evil or behave with unspeakable \ncruelty? Must we \u0014\n         believe, as one reader wrote to me last week, that God \nloves even the bad \u0014\n         people  even the very worst people and that we must \nstrive to do the same?\u0014\n\u0014\n           MY CORRESPONDENT was commenting on a recent column about \nthe death of     \u0014\n         arch terrorist and mass-murderer Yasser Arafat  and \nspecifically on my criticism \u0014\n         of President Bush for having said, on first hearing of \nArafat's death, God bless his \u0014\n         soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n           God bless his soul? What a grotesque idea! I wrote. \nGod, I am quite sure, will \u0014\n         damn him for eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\n           But many readers defended Bush's reaction. One of them was \nPat Buchanan, \u0014\n         who replied to my column in one of his own.\u0014\n\u0014\n           He began with a jab at the presumption of columnists who \nknow the mind\u0014\n         of God. Then he wrote: In defense of President Bush, if \nthat was his first\u0014\n         reaction to Arafat's death, it bespeaks a Christian heart. \nAs a boy in World War\u0014\n         II, I was taught by Catholic nuns that while permissible to \npray for the death\u0014\n         of Hitler or Tojo, it was impermissible to pray for their \ndamnation. That was\u0014\n         hatred, and hatred is a sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Of course, if hatred  even hatred of a Hitler or an \nArafat is a sin, then love                     \u0014\n         even love of such a monster must be a moral duty. And that \nis indeed what \u0014\n         many Christians believe. I say to you, Love your enemies \nand pray for those who \u0014\n         persecute you, Jesus is quoted in Matthew, so that you may \nbe children of your \u0014\n         Father in heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Catholics who pray the rosary implore God to lead all souls \nto heaven, espe-\u0014\n         cially those most in need of thy mercy--especially, in \nother words, the most\u0014\n         wicked. As another e-mailer assured me last week, Any \nChristian would\u0014\n         pray that the Lord would have mercy on someone s soul, even \nif he was a mass\u0014\n         murderer. To do less would be contrary to Bush's faith.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            I HAVE GREAT RESPECT for that faith and a deep \nappreciation for\u0014\n         the good that Christians and Christianity have accomplished \nin the world. But my \u0014\n         faith, Judaism, teaches a fundamentally different lesson \nabout evil and how to \u0014\n         respond to it.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Jewish tradition holds, with Ecclesiastes, that there is a \ntime to love and a time to \u0014\n         hate. The Hebrew Bible enjoins us to love our neighbor \n(Leviticus 19:18)\u0014\n         and to love the stranger (Deuteronomy 10:19). but that love \nhas its limits. We are \u0014\n         not expected to love savage thugs or to ask God's mercy on \nthem. On the\u0014\n         contrary, we loathe the unrepentantly cruel because we \nbelieve that loathes them\u0014\n         too.\u0014\n\u0014\n          It defies reason and upends morality to claim that God \nloves both Saddam\u0014\n         Hussein and the innocent Kurds he gassed to death  that He \nbestows His\u0014\n         love on Osama bin Laden no less than the 3,000 souls he \nbutchered on 9/11.\u0014\n         Of course we should pray that an evildoer will realize the \nawfulness of his ways \u0014\n         and atone for his crimes. But to love him even if he \ndoesn't? To bless him when \u0014\n         he dies?God forbid! To bless the Hitlers and the Arafats of \nis world is to betray \u0014\n         their victims. That we must never do.\u0014\n\u0014\n          That is what Elie Wiesel meant, when he visited Auschwitz \non the 50th anni-                          versary of its liberation \nand entreated, God of forgiveness, do not forgive\u0014\n         those who created this place. That is what the rabbis meant \nwhen they taught,\u0014\n         many centuries ago, that he who is merciful to the cruel \nwill end up being\u0014\n         cruel to the merciful. Hate the sin but love the sinner is \na beautiful rule to\u0014\n         follow in most of our dealings with others. But when it \ncomes to those who\u0014\n         torture and murder without qualm, who are pitiless in the \npain they inflict on\u0014\n         others---when it comes to such people, hatred is no sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n           This theme has been explored in the journal First Things, \nin a brilliant essay\u0014\n         by Meir Y. Soleveichik titled The Virtue of Hate. \nSoleveichik, scion of a\u0014\n         rabbinic family, writes that in his weekly get-togethers \nwith a friend who is an\u0014\n         Episcopal priest, there was one issue on which we could \nnever agree: Is an\u0014\n         utterly evil man Hitler, Stalin, Osama bin Laden  deserving \nof a theist's\u0014\n         love? I could never stomach such a notion, while Fr. Jim \nwould argue pas-\u0014\n         sionately in favor of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Hatred is dangerous even when justified, Soleveichik \ncautions, and must\u0014\n         be directed only at the truly vicious and depraved. We who \nhate must be wary,\u0014\n         he writes, lest we ... become like those we are taught to \ndespise.\u0014\n\u0014\n           BUT WHEN HATRED is called for, he notes, it serves a vital \nfunction.\u0014\n         Hate allows us to keep our guard up, to protect us. When we \nare facing those\u0014\n         who seek nothing but our destruction, our hate reminds us \nwho we are dealing\u0014\n         with. When hate is appropriate, then it is not only \nvirtuous, but essential.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         \u0014\n                  JEFF JACOBY-2OO4, The Boston Globe\u0014",

    "words": "I dont read original brain research stuff, of course. I live a \ncouple of miles from a major university library, so I would have no \ntrouble getting hold of the Journal of Behavioral and Brain \nScience, but I am more comfortable with popularizers like Daniel \nSchachter, Malcolm Gladwell, Michio Kaku, Oliver Sacks, et al. So if \nyou are a brain researcher, and have half a brain [especially the \nleft side], you wont ask me to critique your research.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the scholars, I have learned that no memory is actually a \nmemory. Its not like a photograph or video that is exactly the same \neach time we open the album or run it on the projection screen. It is \na story that we retell each time out of pieces that are scattered \nthroughout our brains. We reconstruct it each time, and since the \nmost recent time we did so, we have had experiences that cause us to \ninterpret it differently, and so, quite possibly, tell/remember it \ndifferently.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, the false stories we tellfalse memories that we have \ncreated out of desire or that have been implanted by othersuse the \nsame neural pathways that real memories do. In other words, even if \na brain researcher could see into our brains, s/he could not tell if \nthe memory is factual or non-factual. In the brain, they look the \nsame.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat explains why lie detectors are not admissible evidence; its \npossible to believe in a non-factual memory so completely that you \ncome across as truthful. Sacks says, Our only memories are \nnarrative.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the great things about being really old is that all our \nstories are completely true, because we believe them.

    "title": "STONING IN THE BIBLE",
    "words": "Stoning in the Bible \u0014\n\u0014\nNEW YORK TIMES SERVICE \u0014\nWednesday, November 6, 1996 \u0014\n\u0014\n(1996 is the date the Taliban came into power in Afghanistan) \u0014\n\u0014\nKANDAHAR, Afghanistan  When the Taliban religious movement decided \nto stone to death a couple caught in adultery, it chose a blazing \nafternoon in late August. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe suffocating desert heat had pushed temperatures past 100 degrees, \nbut those who were there remember how the townspeople came by the \nthousands to witness a spectacle not seen in Kandahar for decades. \u0014\nLong before the condemned Couple arrived on the flatbed of a truck, \ntheir hands and feet tightly bound, every vantage point around the \nforecourt of Id Gah Mosque was taken. Still, according to the Muslim \ntraditions of Afghanistan, space was made so that relatives of the \ncondemned pair, including 'small children, could have a clear view of \nthe type of justice preferred by the Taliban, which now controls \nthree-quarters of the country. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe condemned woman, Nurbibi, 40, was lowered into a pit dug into \nthe. earth beside the wall until only her chest and head were above \nground. Witnesses said she was dressed in a sky-blue burqa, the \nhead-to-toe shroud with a slit for the eyes that the Taliban require \nall women to wear when they are outside their homes. \u0014\nNurbibi's stepson and lover, Taryalai, 38, was taken to a spot (not a \npit) about 20 paces away, blindfolded and turned to face the Muslim \ncleric who was their judge. \u0014\n\u0014\nThose close enough to have heard said the cleric spoke briefly about \nthe provisions for stoning adulterers in the Sharia, the ancient \nMuslim legal code, imposed by the Taliban since they began their rise \nto power in Kandahar two years ago. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen, those witnesses said, the judge, following tradition, stooped \nto pick up the first stone from one of two piles that had been \nprepared, one for each of the condemned pair. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first stone, the witnesses said, was thrown at Nurbibi. Quickly, \nTaliban fighters who had been summoned for the occasion stepped \nforward and launched a cascade of stones. A man who stepped forward \nfrom the crowd to join in the stoning, Rahmatullah, 25, said neither \nNurbibi nor Turyalai had cried out. \u0014\n\u0014\nTuryalai, he said, appeared to be dead after about 10 minutes, but \nthe killing of Nurbibi took longer, past the point where one of her \nsons, stepping forward to check, turned to the judge to say his \nmother was still alive. \u0014\nThe son was crying, Rahmatullah said. I could see it. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt that point, several witnesses said, one of the Taliban fighters \npicked up a large rock, advanced toward Nurbibi and dropped it on her \nhead, finishing her off. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the score of people who gathered before the mosque to offer \ntheir recollections of the stoning, none expressed dismay. To the \ncontrary, all  men and boys, since women in Kandahar are forbidden \nby Taliban rules to linger in public places or to speak to strangers \nspoke with enthusiasm of the killings. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a good thing, the only way to end this kind of sinning, said \nMohammed Younus, 60, a teacher. Mohammed Karim, a 24-year-old Taliban \nfighter, picked up several stones and threw them in an impromptu \nre-enactment of the executions. No, I didn't feel sorry for them at \nall, he said. I was just happy to see Sharia being implemented. \u0014\n\u0014\nCourt-ordered executions of adulterers by stoning have been reported \noccasionally in revolutionary Iran, but since World War II this \npunishment has not been imposed in Afghanistan  until the Taliban \ntook power in Kandahar. [This kind of barbaric, heartless killing \ninfuriates most of us, but maybe we need to look a little further \ninto our own biblical material.]\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing stoned to death is a particularly cruel and barbaric way to \nkill a human being. Executioners bury the victim up to his/her waist \nthen hurl stones at their head and torso until he/she is dead. The \npractice is prohibited by international law, and has been condemned \nby every human rights group in the world. \u0014\nOf course, stoning has been around for centuries. Stoning took place \namong the Greeks, the Hebrews and later Muslims. Ironically, the \nQuran does not prescribe stoning as a means of execution. The \npractice found its way into Islamic law and when it is carried out, \nas it was in Iran and Afghanistan recently, it is the law [not the \nQuran] that governs the process. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the days of gas chambers, lethal injections, and electric \nchairs, the Israelites used what was available: stones. The Old \nTestament prescribed execution by stoning as the punishment for \nblasphemy, idolatry, profaning the Sabbath, human sacrifice, \noccultism, and other offenses. Some genuine offenders were executed, \nbut Jesus lamented that Israel had also stoned true prophets (Matt. \n23:37). John 8:111 [although this account is highly questioned by \nNew Testament scholars because it is found in none of the early \nmanuscripts of John] records the story of a woman about to be stoned \nfor adultery; Jesus uttered His famous words, He who is without sin \namong you, let him throw a stone at her first, and the mob \ndispersed. More than once the Jews decided to stone Jesus himself for \nblasphemy. If his execution had been Jewish instead of Roman, he \nwould have been stoned instead of crucified. \u0014\n\u0014\nStephen, the first Christian martyr, was stoned for blasphemy (Acts \n7:5460). On one occasion Paul was stoned and left for dead, though \nhe recovered (Acts 14:1920). Stoning was a kind of community \nexecution, with the people as a group stoning the offender. It is \nstill seen that way as the greatest benefit for the society. \nEverybody sees the penalty of sin. Deut. 13:6-11 describes one who \nis to die (9) and how he is to be put to death (10.) This was the \nusual method of community punishment. \u0014\n\u0014\nExecutions by stoning took place outside the city (Lev 24:14; 1 Kings \n21:10, 13; Acts 7:58). There was to be no compassion or mercy, even \nbetween family members. Thus Achan and his family are stoned for \nstealing sacred spoils and troubling Israel (Josh 7:126). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe unsettling brutality of stoning expresses the seriousness with \nwhich Israel viewed the sanctity of the community and the danger for \nthose who transgressed. Offenders were crushed by the stones of the \nland and by the hands of the people. This ghastly image is magnified \nby the fact that stoning was a communal sentence carried out by the \ncommon people. It was excommunication from the community in the most \ndire sense. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible does prescribe stoning for a number of offenses. Some of \nthese include worship of other gods, (Deut. 13:10) child sacrifice, \n(Lev. 20:2) spirit-divination, (Ex. 22:18) blasphemy, (Lev. 24:15-16) \nnot observing the Sabbath, (Ex. 31:14) using an ox to kill someone, \nEx. 21:29-30) adultery, (Lev. 20:10) and the insubordinate behavior \nof a child (Ex. 21:15-17). \u0014\n\u0014\nOther offenses calling for the death penalty (remembering that \nstoning was the communal response to such sins) are: Murder (Ex. \n21:12), contempt toward a judge (Deut. 17:12), causing a premature \nbirth (Ex. 21:22-25, false testimony in a capital crime (Deut. \n19:16-19), idolatry (Ex. 22:20), blasphemy (Lev. 24:15-16), false \nprophecy (Deut. 18:20), homosexuality (Lev. 20:13), bestiality (Lev. \n20:10), rape (Deut. 22:25), incest (Lev. 20:11-14), kidnapping (Ex. \n21:16), a priest drinking wine or strong drink while on duty (Lev. \n10:9), an unauthorized person touching holy furnishings. All of these \ncalled for the death penalty \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while we happily no longer practice stoning here in the West, \nthere are those Bible believers who think we should. Last year at the \nRidgecrest Conference Center, a North Carolina retreat owned and \noperated by Southern Baptists, a group calling itself American Vision \nhosted an event called \"Preparing the Generation to Capture the \nFuture.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe basic theme of the conference was the need for conservative \nChristians to reclaim America. Speaker after speaker asserted their \nbelief that America was founded as a Christian nation but was now \ngiving way to secular humanism. Unless true believers step up and \nre-claim our land for Christ, attendees were told, all will be lost. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the featured speakers was Gary North, a Christian \nReconstructionist who believes that only right-thinking Christians \nshould hold elected offices. In many books and pamphlets, North has \nlaid out his vision of an America governed by Old Testament precepts, \nand that includes the practice of stoning. In fact, North has written \nthat stoning is the preferred method of execution since it is a \ncommunal activity and the resources for accomplishing it are readily \navailable. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo why don't we stone people anymore? Well, the Eighth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" \nStoning would seem to fall into that category. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it's still in the Bible, and many believers insist it should \nbe read and interpreted literally. So what do we do about that? Its \nclear that by the time the Hebrew people moved into Canaan (the \nPromised Land), these regulations were generally and largely ignored. \nBy the time of the prophets, they were hardly a memory.\u0014",

    "words": "Story Behind the Song\u0014\n\"Joy to the World\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three men behind one of our greatest Christmas carols.\u0014\nBy Lindsay Terry\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of our most popular Christmas carols is the result of the efforts \nof Isaac Watts and Lowell Masonand, some believe, George Frederick \nHandel. Watts was a frail, quiet man only five feet tall. Mason was \nan energetic publisher, choir director, and composer. Handel was a \nlarge, robust musical genius. Handel and Watts were contemporaries in \nLondon and one imagines they must have appreciated each other's \ntalents. Mason lived 100 years later in Boston.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1719 Isaac Watts, already a notable scholar and author, sat down \nunder a tree at the Abney Estate near London and began to compose \npoetry based on Psalm 98. Watts had begun writing verses as a small \nchild. In his teen years he complained that the songs in church were \nhard to sing. His father said, \"Well, you write some that are \nbetter.\" And so he did. For the next two years, young Isaac wrote a \nnew hymn each week. (He would eventually write more than 600 of them, \nall based on Scripture.) Today, hymns like \"Alas! and Did My Savior \nBleed\" and \"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross\" are hallmarks of the \nChristian church, and Watts is regarded as \"the Father of English \nHymnody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1741 George Frederick Handel, who was already famous as the \ncomposer of several operas and oratorios, decided that he wanted to \ndo a truly great work. After spending time in prayer, he arose from \nhis knees and for 23 days labored almost continuously day and night. \nThe immortal Messiah, now a Christmas tradition, was the fruit of \nthat incessant struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nA nobleman once praised Handel for the \"entertainment\" he had \nfurnished in one of his compositions. In no uncertain terms Handel \nlet the nobleman know that his music was composed to make men better, \nnot to entertain them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost a century later, Lowell Mason set Watts's poem of \"joy\" to \nmusic. For years it was assumed that Mason used tunes from Handel's \nMessiah for portions of the arrangement, but the veracity of that \nclaim is now debated among scholars. Listeners can judge for \nthemselves. But this we know: It was Mason who ultimately brought the \npieces together to give us \"Joy to the World.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLindsay Terry is the author of The Sacrifice of Praise: Stories \nBehind the Greatest Praise and Worship Songs of All Time (Integrity).\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Today's Christian magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "SUPER BLOOD MOON - IS THIS A SIGN OF ANYTHING?",
    "words": "Super Wolf Blood Moon to Occur This Month, Is This a Sign of War in \nthe Middle East?\u0014\n\u0014\nKayla Koslosky | ChristianHeadlines.com Editor\u0014\n\u0014\nA Super Blood Wolf Moon is set to grace the night sky between January \n20 and January 21 this year (2019), and some are marking it as a sign \nof war in the Middle East. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst thing is first, what is a Super Blood Wolf Moon? \u0014\n\u0014\nA Super Blood Wolf Moon is first a Super Moon. A Super Moon occurs \nwhen the moon is at the point in its orbit when it is closest to the \nEarth. According to USA Today, the moon can look up to 14 percent \nbigger during this point in its orbit.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, it is a Blood Moon. Blood Moons were given their name because \nof the brassy-red color the moon turns when the Earth blocks the \nmajority of the sunlight from reaching it. Just like how your finger \nturns red when you press your finger against your phone light, the \nmoon will shine as red because light is still passing through Earths \natmosphere, only the blue is being filtered out, USA Today reports.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Old Farmers Almanac, a Full moon in January is \ncalled the Wolf Moon. The Almanac notes that this specific type of \nmoon has been referred to as a Wolf Moon since Native American and \nColonial times because it appear[s] when wolves howled in hunger \noutside of villages. Essentially the wolf part of the name refers to \nthe fact the moon is full.   \u0014\n\u0014\nNow we have a massive, full, red-colored moon so what? Well, its \nabout to eclipse.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Mental Floss, the Super Blood Wolf Moon is set to \ntotally eclipse Between 9:12 pm on January 20 and 12:12 am on January \n21. The eclipse, which will be seen in North America, comes exactly \none year after a Super Blood Wolf Moon total eclipse occurred over \nthe Middle East and it also happens to occur on the same day \nPresident Trump was inaugurated two years ago, WND reports.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book on the Biblical significance of blood moons, Pastor Mark \nBiltz notes that celestial bodies work as signs to mark sacred \ntimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlitz made all sorts of connections between the Super Blood Wolf Moon \nand history, telling WND, Trump was born on the night of June 14, \n1946, within 15 minutes of a total lunar eclipse and 700 days before \nthe state of Israel was established. When he was sworn in as \npresident on January 20, 2017, he was 70-years-old, seven months and \nseven days. Also, very significantly, the Super Blood Moon also falls \non the Jewish holiday of Tu BShevat. Even more significant is the \nfact that there was another Blood Moon on Tu BShevat last year! Last \nyear the blood moon was seen over the Middle East and this year will \nbe seen over the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlitz continued. The Bible says that everything is to be established \nby two or three witnesses, As a matter of fact the Bible says in \nPsalms 89 that Gods covenant with Israel and King David is forever \nand the sun and the moon are to be His faithful witnesses in heaven \nconfirming that, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pastor then cited several passages in Zechariah (6, 1:7), \nLeviticus (19:23-25), and Revelation (6), and noted that based on his \nBiblical analysis, this Super Wolf Blood Moon indicates, not the end \nof the world, but a war in the Middle East. He said, Im not saying \nit is the end of the world or that anything will happen on the 20th. \nI am saying the patterns show this year could possibly bring a war to \nthe Middle East but Israel will be victorious and we may see a \ndeclaration for the rebuilding of the Temple.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------Acts 2:20 just for One Example: New \nInternational Version\u0014\nThe sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the \ncoming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.\u0014",

    "title": "SAVONAROLA'S PREACHING GOT HIM BURNED - 1498",
    "words": "Savonarola's Preaching Got Him Burned - 1498\u0014\n\u0014\nGirolamo Savonarola of Florence, Italy lived in a time that was in \nmany ways like our own. It was an age of great discoveries, \nextraordinary artistic and communications achievements, the emergence \nof new views of the world, great self-consciousness and pride in \nhuman achievement. It was also an age of restlessness in the world of \nfaith and religion that was bound to erupt sooner or later. \u0014\n\u0014\nKen Curtis\u0014\n \u0014\nToday tourists by the thousands travel to Florence, Italy to view the \nglorious art of the Renaissance. Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, \nMachiavelli, Boccacio, Ghiberti, Raphael -- they all painted, wrote, \nor sculpted in this Italian city. Their works are the treasures of \nFlorence. Yet, when Jerome Savonarola (1452-1498) looked at \nRenaissance Florence, the beauty, glory, and grandeur created by the \nartists were overshadowed by the decadence, corruption, and moral rot \nthere.\u0014\n\u0014\nPassionate Preaching, Powerful Predictions\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Medici family of Florence were the great art patrons who had \nbeautified their city with art still admired as among the world's \nbest. When Savonarola, a Dominican friar, came to Florence in the \n1480's, Lorenzo de Medici, the Magnificent, was in the last years of \nhis life. Savonarola shook the population by his sermons from \nRevelation, warning of the wrath to come. Tears came to the \nlisteners' eyes as they also heard his tender assurances of God's \nmercy. In warning of coming judgment, Savonarola also predicted the \nimpending deaths of Lorenzo de Medici, the pope, and the king of \nNaples.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1491 Savonarola was elected prior of St. Mark's convent in \nFlorence. The convent had been enriched by the Medicis, and it was \nconsidered the duty of the new superior to pay homage to Lorenzo. But \nSavonarola refused. He said his election was from God, not the \nMedicis!\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Easy Absolution\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin a few months Lorenzo lay on his deathbed. Oppressed by his \nsins, he called for Savonarola to absolve him. Savonarola promised \nLorenzo absolution on three conditions. First, he should repent and \nhave faith in God's mercy. Lorenzo readily agreed. Second, he should \ngive up his ill-gotten wealth. Lorenzo was more reluctant on this \none, but did agree. Finally, he should restore the republican \nliberties of Florence. At this Lorenzo turned his face to the wall \nand did not reply. Savonarola left without absolving the ruler. \nShortly after Lorenzo died, Pope Innocent VIII also died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe infamous Cardinal Borgia was elected Pope Alexander VI. In one of \nhis sermons Savonarola told of seeing a hand appearing in the sky \nbearing a flaming sword with the words, \"Behold the sword of the Lord \nwill descend suddenly and quickly upon the earth.\" He warned of \njudgment for sins and mercy to the faithful. The pope had reason to \nbe concerned!\u0014\n\u0014\nDramatic Changes at Florence\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the French King Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494, the Medici \nrulers fled. Through negotiation Savonarola was able to prevent King \nCharles from sacking Florence and used his influence to move the city \ntowards a more godly government. Like Calvin later in Geneva, \nSavonarola never held political office, but his sermons heavily \ninfluenced the city government. Some reforms were immediate -- relief \nwas brought to the starving population, shops were opened to give \nwork to the unemployed, a bank was established for charitable loans \nand taxes were reduced. All people were exhorted to place their trust \nin the Lord. Two key ideas in Savonarola's Florence were that \ngovernment by one man would become tyrannical and the very new idea \nthat the people were the source of power, with the right to elect \nmagistrates.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola wanted Florence to be a Christian republic with God as \ngovernor. The Gospel would be the basis of law, and the council \npassed strong regulations against vice, frivolity, gambling, and \nextravagant dress. Many of Savonarola's sermons were based on the Old \nTestament prophets and Revelation. He maintained that his mission was \nto warn people of the coming day of judgment.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola was hanged and then burned at a stake on May 23, 1498. As \nthe bishop stripped him of his priestly garb, he said, \"I separate \nthee from the church militant and from the church triumphant.\" \nSavonarola replied, \"That is beyond your power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SAVO'S WORLD?\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola lived in a time that was in many ways like our own. It was \nan age of great discoveries, extraordinary artistic and \ncommunications achievements, the emergence of new views of the world, \ngreat self-consciousness and pride in human achievement. It was also \nan age of restlessness in the world of faith and religion that was \nbound to erupt sooner or later. Here are just some of the many great \npeople and momentous events during the years Savonarola lived \n(1452-1498):\u0014\n\u0014\n1452 - Savonarola born; Ghiberti completed his magnificent bronze \ndoors at Florence baptistery; Leonardo da Vinci born \u0014\n1453 - Gutenberg prints the Mazarin Bible at Mainz; Turks convert \nConstantinople's magnificent St. Sophia into a mosque\u0014\n1455 - Painter Fra Angelico born\u0014\n1456 - Trial of Joan of Arc annulled\u0014\n1465 - Erasmus born 1469 - Lorenzo de Medici begins rule of Florence \nwhich ended in 1492; Niccolo Machiavelli born\u0014\n1473 - Birth of Nicolaus Copernicus\u0014\n1477 - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales published by William Caxton\u0014\n1478 - Birth of Thomas More\u0014\n1480 - Inquisition against Jews begins in Spain\u0014\n1481 - Botticelli and others paint frescoes in Rome's Sistine Chapel\u0014\n1483 - Martin Luther born\u0014\n1492 - Columbus' voyage to the New World; Spain conquers Granada, \nending kingdom of Moors\u0014\n1493 - Pope Alexander VI issues a \"bull\" dividing New World between \nSpain and Portugal \u0014\n1494 - Charles VIII invades Italy; Pope Alexander VI takes refuge in \nCastel Sant' Angelo\u0014\n1495-98 - Da Vinci paints Last Supper \u0014\n1498 - Michelangelo completes \"Pieta\" sculpture in St. Peter's, Rome\u0014",

    "title": "ST. PETER'S NEW FOUNDATION",
    "words": "St. Peters' New Foundation\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nThe walls of the old church were veined with cracks. Might it not \ncollapse and kill the worshippers within? Nicholas V thought so. He \nsummoned two famous architects with orders to strengthen the historic \nbuilding. Alberti and Rossellino looked it over and came up with a \nplan for new walls.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's basilica, first constructed by Constantine the Great, was \nto be shored up. It sat on the site where tradition says Peter was \nburied when executed in 67 A. D. As early as 90 A. D. an oratory had \nmemorialize the spot. The work was just begun when Nicholas died. \nSucceeding popes let the project lapse.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot until Julius II became pope was the project revived. Julius threw \nout halfway measures, determined to replace the basilica completely. \nAs architect, he appointed Bramante. Bramante drew up huge plans and \noutraged traditionalists by rudely ripping down the old building. He \nshould at least have disassembled the old columns, they sputtered, to \nbe reused. Bramante went ahead with excavation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this date April 11, 1506, Pope Julius laid the foundation stone. \nThe elderly vicar descended deep into the earth on a wobbly rope \nladder to perform the honor. Lack of funds slowed construction. Leo X \nreplaced Julius in 1513 and after Bramante's death in 1514 made \nRaphael the chief architect.\u0014\n\u0014\nWork progressed slowly, due to lack of funds. Raphael never completed \nthe project. Sangello, Verone, Sangallo and Peruzzi also served as \narchitects at one time or another. Eventually Michelangelo was put in \ncharge. He was then in his seventies, but redrew the plans. By the \ntime he died in 1564, the shell of the dome was complete.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe great cathedral was not finished until 1626, 120 years after \nJulius laid the first stone. Then Carlo Maderna completed the facade. \nMen in those times projected their schemes across centuries. It is \none of the most admirable characteristics of the church which \nconfidently expected the body of Christ to survive all ups and downs. \nNeither Bramante's plans nor Michelangelo's were adhered to. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsequently the finished building was a series of compromises. \nDespite this it came forth with grandeur, its vast interior \ngloriously decorated. It covers four acres. St. Peter, who admired \nHerod's great temple in Jerusalem and preached and healed in it, \nmight have been astonished at this triumph of religious architecture.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was to pay for Raphael's efforts, by the way, that Leo X \nauthorized the indulgence which led to Luther's 95 theses. \nUnfortunately, the edifice which sums up Catholic tradition and its \npatronage of the arts became a cause of the second greatest division \nin Christendom (the first being the East-West split in 1054) when \nLuther insisted indulgences were not necessary for Christians who can \ngo directly to their Savior for forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "What Skeptical Scholars Admit about the Resurrection Appearances of \nJesus \u0014\nThe historical evidence is clear: Those who claimed to see him risen \nmust have seen something.\u0014\nJUSTIN BASS        APRIL 13, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nOn June 26, 2000, ABC aired a documentary called The Search for \nJesus. The networks leading news anchor, Peter Jennings, interviewed \nliberal and conservative scholars of early Christianity about what we \ncan know historically concerning Jesus life, death, and \nresurrection. The series ended with a striking statement by New \nTestament scholar Paula Fredriksen, who is not a Christian herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommenting on the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus, Fredriksen \nsaid,\u0014\nI know in their own terms what they saw was the raised Jesus. Thats \nwhat they say, and then all the historic evidence we have afterwards \nattest to their conviction that thats what they saw. Im not saying \nthat they really did see the raised Jesus. I wasnt there. I dont \nknow what they saw. But I do know that as a historian that they must \nhave seen something.\u0014\nShes admitting, in other words, that the best available historical \nevidence confirms that followers of Jesus like Mary Magdalene, his \nbrother James, Peter and his other disciples, and even an enemy \n(Paul) were absolutely convinced that the crucified man Jesus \nappeared to them alive, raised from the dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nFredriksen is not alone in supposing that these followers must have \nseen something. Virtually every Bible scholar across the Western \nworld, regardless of religious background, agrees that Jesus \nearliest followers believed he appeared to them alive. This is what \nlaunched the worlds largest religion. As a result of these \nappearances, Jewish fishermen began proclaiming to crowds in \nJerusalem that God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all \nwitnesses of it (Acts 2:32). Two thousand years later, the message \nof Jesus death and resurrection is proclaimed by billions of \nChristians in nearly every nation and in almost every language on \nplanet earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did all these witnesses see?\u0014\n\u0014\nA Bedrock Confession\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the earliest source we have on record for Jesus death \nand resurrection, a hidden pearl found within 1 Corinthians 15, Jesus \nappeared to multiple individuals and groups, and at least one enemy. \nThis creedal tradition, according to virtually all scholars, dates to \nwithin five years of Jesus death. Through this source, we can reach \nback to the earliest years of the Christian movement in Jerusalem, to \nthe bedrock confession of the earliest followers of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:38:\u0014\nFor what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that \nChrist died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was \nburied, that he was raised on the third day according to the \nScriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. \nAfter that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and \nsisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some \nhave fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the \napostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one \nabnormally born.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis catalog of Resurrection appearances is unparalleled in the New \nTestament, even in all of ancient literature. We learn from this list \nthat Jesus appeared to three individuals: Cephas (Peter), his chief \ndisciple; James, his brother; and Paul, his former enemy. And we also \nlearn that he appeared to three groups: the Twelve (disciples, minus \nJudas); more than 500 early followers; and all the apostles.\u0014\nThat Jesus appeared to more than 500 men and women at the same time \nis a truly remarkable claim. Paul boldly puts his credibility on the \nline when he mentions that most of them are still alive. After all, \nhe is essentially inviting members of the Corinthian church to travel \nto Jerusalem and speak to these witnesses, investigating for \nthemselves what it was like to see the risen Jesus. We can see, then, \nthat solid eyewitness testimony to the risen Jesus was readily \navailable in the decades following his resurrection. As G. K. \nChesterton observed in The Everlasting Man, This is the sort of \ntruth that is hard to explain because it is a fact; but it is a fact \nto which we can call witnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Magdalene also belongs on the list of key eyewitnesses, as she \ntoo was readily available to be questioned about her experience with \nthe risen Jesus. As the agnostic New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman \nwrites in How Jesus Became God, it is significant that Mary \nMagdalene enjoys such prominence in all the Gospel Resurrection \nnarratives, even though she is virtually absent everywhere else in \nthe Gospels. She is mentioned in only one passage in the entire New \nTestament in connection with Jesus during his public ministry (Luke \n8:13), and yet she is always the first to announce that Jesus has \nbeen raised. Why is this? One plausible explanation is that she too \nhad a vision of Jesus after he died. Mary Magdalene was given the \nhigh honor of being not only the first to see the risen Jesus but the \nfirst person in history to proclaim, I have seen the Lord! (John \n20:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever these eyewitnesses saw, it transformed their lives to the \npoint of being willing to suffer and die for it. In 2 Corinthians \n11:2333, Paul recounts his almost daily suffering for his conviction \nthat Jesus appeared to him. He was beaten, imprisoned, stoned, \nstarved, lost at sea, and daily in danger of all kinds of evil on his \njourneys throughout the Roman Empire.\u0014\nWe also possess strong historical evidence that certain key \neyewitnesses were martyred for their faith. Peter, for instance, was \ncrucified. James was stoned. Paul was beheaded. Whatever they saw, it \nwas worth giving their lives for. They sealed their testimonies with \ntheir blood.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Magic Wand of Mass Hysteria\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to explain away these Resurrection appearances, some \nscholars have speculated that the eyewitnesses were merely \nhallucinating.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his excellent book Resurrecting Jesus, New Testament scholar Dale \nAllison surveys the available scientific studies and literature on \nhallucinations. In documented cases, he concludes, there are four \nthings that do not happen (or rarely happen). First, hallucinations \nare rarely seen by multiple individuals and groups over an extended \nperiod of time. Second, hallucinations are rarely seen by large \ngroups of people, especially groups of more than eight. Third, \nhallucinations have never led to the claim that a dead person has \nbeen resurrected. And fourth, hallucinations do not involve the \npersons enemy. (We could also add the fact that hallucinations \ntypically arent known for launching global movements or world \nreligions.)\u0014\n\u0014\nYet in the case of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, every last \none of these rare or seemingly impossible circumstances has come to \npass.\u0014\n\u0014\nAllison sums up the implications forcefully: These appear to be the \nfacts, and they raise the question of how we should explain them. The \napologists for the faith say that the sightings of Jesus must, given \nthe reports, have been objective. One person can hallucinate, but \ntwelve at the same time? And dozens over an extended period of time? \nThese are legitimate questions, and waving the magical wand of mass \nhysteria will not make them vanish.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/ Skeptics and the Resurrection \nAppearances.docx\u0014",

    "words": "Pat Robertson Suggests Same-Sex Marriage, Abortion Among Reasons For \nCOVID-19\u0014\nGod wont end the coronavirus pandemic until people repent of certain \nsins, the televangelist indicated on The 700 Club.\u0014\n\u0014\nTelevangelist Pat Robertson agreed that abortion and same-sex \nmarriage are partly to blame for the novel coronavirus that has \ncaused massive social and economic upheaval in the U.S. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 90-year-old Christian Broadcasting Network founder suggested that \nGod wont end the coronavirus pandemic until people turn from their \nwicked ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou confess your sins and forsake them. Then he heals the land. Its \nnot before, he said on an episode of his show, The 700 Club, \nearlier this week.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertsons comments came during a segment in which he fields \nquestions from viewers. On Monday, a viewer asked him about how a \npopular Bible verse, 2 Chronicles 7:14, applies to COVID-19, the \nillness caused by the novel coronavirus. The verse reads, If my \npeople, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray \nand seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear \nfrom heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe viewer asked: How can God heal our land and forgive the sins \nwhen abortion and same-sex marriage are laws and many people are \nanti-Israel. Doesnt this prevent his healing and forgiveness? \u0014\n\u0014\nRobertson told the viewer, You are right.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think you put your finger on something very important. You know \nthe Bible says ? they turn from their wicked ways, he said. We are \nnot turning when we have done terrible things.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his response, Robertson explicitly cited abortion and abuse of the \npoor as some of the reasons why God would hold us guilty. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christian traditions would agree that abusing the poor is a \nserious sin. But Christian denominations in the U.S. have adopted a \nwide range of positions on issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion \nand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin American evangelicalism, whether Robertsons views are \nmainstream or fringe is a matter of debate between scholars. What \nisnt up for debate, however, is his networks reach and influence. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 700 Club is the flagship program of CBN, the conservative \nnetwork Robertson founded in 1960. The show has considerable reach ? \nabout 650,000 U.S. households watch Robertsons 700 Club program \nevery day, according to CBN. The network also maintains close ties to \nPresident Donald Trumps administration and regularly features \nhigh-ranking White House officials as guests on its shows.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertsons roots are in the Southern Baptist Convention, Americas \nlargest Protestant denomination. But over the years, he has become \nmore closely identified with charismatic Christianity, which \nemphasizes spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and prophecy. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe televangelist has long drawn criticism for taking inflammatory \npositions on Islam, LGBTQ issues and feminism. Hes received backlash \nfor appearing to blame national tragedies on culture war issues, such \nas LGBTQ rights and abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, Robertson and fellow \ntelevangelist Jerry Falwell, Sr. speculated on the 700 Club that \nGod had allowed the terrorists to succeed because the U.S. had become \na nation of abortion, feminism, homosexuality, and secularism. Faced \nwith withering disapproval from then-President George W. Bush and \nfellow evangelicals, both men later insisted their comments were \ntaken out of context.\u0014\n\u0014\nJason Bivins, a scholar of religion and politics at North Carolina \nState University, argued that Robertsons belief that God withholds \nblessings from nations because of certain sins is very common \nwithin American evangelicalism, particularly among middle-aged and \nolder white evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian Rights belief in Gods covenantal relationship with \nthe U.S., and  in end-times prophecies about Israel, has helped shape \nU.S. foreign policy for decades, Bivins said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only is Robertson not an outlier, but this sensibility is very \nmuch present at the highest levels of the U.S. government, even if \nthe rhetoric doesnt always get wielded as bluntly as it does by \nRobertson, Bivins said.\u0014",

It was 1968. \nIn July of that year, Life magazine published a shocking cover \nshowing a pair of starving children in Biafra.

    "words": "A Message to Our White Friends: Stop Raising Racist Kids!\u0014\nBy Joao Chaves and Malcolm Foley\u0014\n\u0014\nJune 3, 2020  Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last few days have filled our memories with more blood of unarmed \nblack men and women.\u0014\n\u0014\nAhmaud Arberys, Breonna Taylors and George Floyds lives were taken \nin front of us in an outrageous spectacle of monstrosity that reveals \nthe worst tendencies of our white supremacist society.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is impossible to know how many other lives of minoritized people \nwere taken in the last few months, weeks or days.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsian Americans are being increasingly threatened in the streets of \nthe Land of the Free.\u0014\n\u0014\nJewish communities have been recently attacked in their houses of \nworship in instances of racist carnage.\u0014\n\u0014\nDomestic terrorist attacks against brown bodies  Latinxs and Arab \nAmericans among them  are commonplace in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhite supremacy kills, terrorizes, traumatizes, limits, offends, \nhurts, disorients. And yet, far too many white people still continue \nto raise racist children.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be clear, we do not challenge the fact that many white individuals \nare sincerely outraged with the display of racist carnage in the \ntaking of minoritized lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do, however, see that this outrage comes with a paradox: White \npeople continue to be outraged at these monstrous events as if they \nwere unharmonious with American society.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhite friends, this is the society in which minoritized groups have \nalways lived, and your children are destined to continue it.\u0014\nWhite outrage against racist monstrosity distracts whites from the \ninsidious reality of white supremacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacist carnage gives whites a scapegoating mechanism that allows them \nto show how racially conscious they are without committing to \nchanging the normalized, structural elements that sustain their \nprivileges.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont get us wrong. You should be outraged, white friends. Just do \nnot be outraged only at the spectacles of racist violence that went \nviral.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe outraged at a broken educational system that favors your child \nover ours. Be outraged at a legal system that will acquit you when \nyou are guilty but condemn us when we are not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe outraged at an entertainment industry that continues to portray \nyou as the hero and us as the violent villains. Be outraged at the \nfact that in the race of life, you start many miles ahead of us even \nwhen we beat you.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe outraged at the fact that it is harder for us to go to the polls \nto vote. Then let your outrage be heard on Nov. 3; you can speak \nlouder then.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside of this more general, consistent outrage, your racial \nconsciousness is a good start, but not much more.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, outrage on its own does not substantively shift \nsystems that have been built up and maintained for centuries. \nShifting public opinion is good and necessary but not sufficient.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there is anything that American history teaches us, it is that \nwhite supremacy is resilient and insidious.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took generations of being bathed in racist narratives for even \nracialized minorities to feel uneasy around their brothers in hoodies.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are to be anti-racist and consistently so, it is going to \nrequire resolve as we are up against centuries of history and it may \nrequire that long to see its eventual eradication.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike racial chattel slavery, white supremacy will not end with war. \nUnlike lynching, white supremacy will not end with publicity. Unlike \nsegregation, white supremacy will not end with legislation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe want our white brothers and sisters to know that one of the best \nways to end white supremacy is to fight it where it began and where \nit finds its most fertile ground  in your homes and in your own \nhearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIbram X. Kendi is right when he says the heartbeat of anti-racism is \nconfession.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt begins with beating back the voice in our heads that insists to us \nthat were not racist and instead listening to the one that tells \nus we dont even know the extent to which we hold racist ideas and \nrally support for racist policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must not remain in that position, however. That is only the first \nstep in a lifelong journey of confession, self-interrogation and \nactivism as we not only recognize white supremacy but also seek to \nroot it out.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet it is necessary for you to first walk that path and teach your \nchildren and communities to walk that path.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen the cry of What are you doing to make sure youre raising \nchildren that wont kill mine? wont fall on deaf ears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, take it to your homes, take it to the streets and take it to the \npolls because white supremacy kills, and we must be in the business \nof preserving life.\u0014\n \u0014\nJoao Chaves and Malcolm Foley\u0014\nJoao Chaves, Ph.D. is Associate Editor of Perpectivas, the Journal of \nthe Hispanic Theological Initiative.\u0014\nMalcolm Foley, Ph.D. (ABD) is Director of Discipleship at Mosaic Waco.\u0014",

To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street Congregational \nChurch in Boston sang it at a Sunday school celebration. Beginning \nwith the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of \nliberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. One leader commented \nthat since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep in trust in God, \nchildren and philosophers can repeat the hymn together. The tune to \n\"America\" is actually the official or semiofficial melody of about \ntwenty nations. For over a century it had been England's anthem, \"God \nSave the Queen (or King).\" As early as the seventeenth century it was \nfound in Swiss music and had a long history of usage in Germany, \nSweden, and Russia. Nine years after Smith adopted it, Beethoven \nwrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe composed 150 hymns during his life.\u0014",

    "words": "SLAVERY, TOM COTTON, AND UNNECESSARY EVILS\u0014\nJuly 27, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nWendell Griffen, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nThe July 26, 2020 issue of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper \ncontains an article based on an interview of U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, \nthe junior senator from Arkansas.  The article written by that \npapers Washington, DC correspondent, Frank Lockwood, quotes Senator \nCottons assertion during a recent interview that slavery was the \nnecessary evil upon which the union was built  Cotton made that \nassertion to support legislation he is sponsoring that would prohibit \npublic schools in the U.S. from using material from the New York \nTimes 1619 Project that traces U.S. history to 1619 and the \nenslavement of Africans \n(see,ttps://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/jul/26/bill-by-cotton-targets-curriculum-on-slavery/?ne).\u0014\n\u0014\nSenator Cottons view that slavery was the necessary evil upon which \nthe union was built is flawed logic and flawed ethics.  It is flawed \nlogic because morally competent people can choose good rather than \nevil.  A decision to act in evil ways is not logically necessary if \npeople have the power to act in ways that are not evil. \u0014\n\u0014\nCottons flawed logic is also ethically (morally) wrong.  Kidnapping, \ntrafficking, enslaving, selling, purchasing, raping, maiming, and \nstealing the lives and labor of Africans were deliberate evils \ncommitted based on greed, not need.  Slavery was, at bottom, a \ncommercial venture undertaken by Southern planters (of cotton, \ntobacco, and other cash crops) and Northern ship owners whose \ncapitalist self-interest was a driving reason for seeking \nindependence from King George. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfricans were kidnapped, enslaved, transported across oceans, held \nhostage, bought, and sold by white men whose highest principle was \ngreed, not need.  The white Founding Fathers knew this was so.  \nPerhaps that explains why they deleted a 168 word passage from the \ndraft of the Declaration of Independence prepared by Thomas Jefferson \nthat blamed King George for perpetuating the slave trade (see \nhttps://www.history.com/news/declaration-of-independence-deleted-anti-slavery-clause-jefferson\u0014\n\u0014\nTom Cottons flawed logic and flawed sense of history exposes how \nlies about American exceptionalism and virtue have been told, sold, \nand repeated in American public education to prevent students from \nknowing inconvenient truths. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States was not established to ensure the inalienable \nrights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all \npersons but was established by and to benefit wealthy white men. \u0014\n\u0014\nWealthy white men conspired, plotted, schemed, pooled their money, \nand deliberately designed a system of government that would allow \nthem to steal, transport, and hold Africans hostage in this land as \nenslaved persons for generations. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe successors of those wealthy white men created empires, cities, \nstates, and the nation by not paying Africans a cent for 250 years of \nwork, and by defrauding their descendants and discriminating against \nthem in numerous ways since then. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Times 1619 project exposes the fraud and hypocrisy \nbehind Cottons view that the United States is the greatest and \nnoblest country in the history of mankind.  The 1619 Project also \ndoes something else that offends Cotton and people of his ilk.  The \n1619 Project provides historical support for the view held by Nikole \nHannah-Jones, the NYTimes Pulitzer Prize winning investigative \nreporter who recently wrote in the June 28, 2020 issue of the New \nYork Times magazine that If true justice and equality are ever to be \nachieved in the United States, the country must finally take \nseriously what it owes black Americans A truly great country does \nnot ignore or excuse its sins.  It confronts them and works to make \nthem right.  (See, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/24/magazine/reparations-slavery.html).  \nConfronting the sins of slavery and working to make them right \nraises the issue of reparations. \u0014\n\u0014\nTom Cotton cannot handle that truth.   Instead, Cotton prefers that \npublic schools perpetuate slaveholder history, hypocrisy, and lies \nabout this society being a meritocracy than expose students to the \ntruth that wealthy white men deliberately chose to enslave Africans \nto create what became the United States.  Cotton wants the current \nand coming generations of students in public schools to continue \nbelieving the hypocrisy and lies that have always been the foundation \nfor the U.S. brand of white supremacy and religious nationalism that \nis euphemistically termed American exceptionalism. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1619 Project allows teachers to help students learn and know that \nthe United States was created as a slavocracy bottomed on land stolen \nfrom indigenous people and labor stolen from enslaved Africans.  As \nstudents realize this hard truth, they will also be able to trace how \nthe greed, hypocrisy, deceit, and violence surrounding chattel \nslavery evolved to produce other evil results across centuries since \nthe nation was founded thru continued discrimination against black \nAmericans specifically and wage theft against laborers in general. \u0014\n\u0014\nTom Cotton cannot handle that truth because he is intellectually and \nmorally incompetent.  We should not subject current and coming \nstudents to his sorry plight.\u0014\n\u0014\nWendell Griffen, an Arkansas pastor, state court trial judge, author, \nand social justice commentator, lives and works in Little Rock, \nArkansas.\u0014",

    "title": "SLAVEHOLDING EVANGLIST--GEORGE WHITFIELD",
    "words": "Slaveholding Evangelist\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield's troubling mix of views.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Galli, Associate Editor of Christian History.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen George Whitefield first journeyed through Americas southern \ncolonies, he was deeply disturbed\u0014\nby how slaves were brutalized by their masters. In 1740, in an angry, \nopen letter to three southern\u0014\ncolonies, he wrote: Your dogs are caressed and fondled at your \ntables; but your slaves who are\u0014\nfrequently styled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege. They \nare scarce permitted to pick up the\u0014\ncrumbs which fall from their masters tables. Although I pray God \nthe slaves may never be permitted\u0014\nto get the upper hand, yet should such a thing be permitted by \nProvidence, all good men must\u0014\nacknowledge the judgment would be just.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield was genuinely concerned for blacks: Their consciences are \nawake, and consequently\u0014\nprepared in good measure for hearing the gospel. When preaching to \nmixed crowds, he often\u0014\naddressed African-Americans as a group, and he chastised slaveholders \nfor not teaching their slaves\u0014\nabout Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also purchased 5,000 acres in Pennsylvania to build a school for \nthe instruction of these poor\u0014\ncreatures. He intended to do the same in South Carolina. (Neither \nproject succeeded.)\u0014\n\u0014\nMany African-Americans felt Whitefields concern. During a stay in \nCharleston, he reported, Several of\u0014\nthe Negroes did their work in less time than usual, that they might \ncome to hear me.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the most part, though, Whitefields sermons avoided talk about \nmasters duties to slaves, though not\u0014\nthe reverse: Though [God] hath now called you [slaves] into his own \nfamily  he doth not call you\u0014\nthereby from the service of your masters according to the flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, Whitefield took an unfortunate stand. In 1740, he had \nestablished an orphanage, called Bethesda,\u0014\nin Georgia. By 1747, both colony and orphanage were suffering \neconomically. The reason, according to\u0014\nWhitefield?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe constitution of that colony [Georgia] is very bad, and it is \nimpossible for the inhabitants to subsist\u0014\nwithout the use of slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe solution? Whitefield allowed some friends to purchase for him a \nplantation and slaves, which I\u0014\npropose to devote to the support of Bethesda. One Negro has been \ngiven me. Some more I purpose to\u0014\npurchase this week.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the late 1740s, Whitefield advocated legalizing slavery in \nGeorgia. His concern for orphans had won\u0014\nout over his concern for blacks: Had Negroes been allowed, I should \nnow have had a sufficiency to\u0014\nsupport a great many orphans without expending above half the sum \nthat has been laid out.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield was not out of step with the times. By 1776, only one \ndenomination in Americathe Quakers\u0014\nhad declared slaveholding a sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an evangelist, Whitefield was unconventional and remarkable. \nLamentably, his views on slavery were\u0014\nconventional and unremarkable.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1993 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine\u0014",

On \nthe contrary, as he sat by the fire in his English home in the \nmid-nineteenth century, his hands kept busy, whittling out useful \nobjects, such as shoehorns. His mind was active, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalled on to preach from time to time in a rural English church, \nWillam Walford composed sermons in his head to deliver on Sundays. He \nmemorized a huge amount of the Bible which he quoted verbatim in his \nsermons. Some of his folk thought he had memorized the entire \nScripture, cover to cover. William also composed lines of verse. And \nhe prayed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Salmon, a New York native, spent some time in Coleshill, \nWarwickshire, England, where he became acquainted with William. He \ntells this tale of what happened one day, while he was visiting the \nblind pastor:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...He repeated two or three pieces which he had composed, and having \nno friend at home to commit them to paper, he had laid them up in the \nstorehouse within. \"How will this do?\" asked he, as he repeated the \nfollowing lines, with a complacent smile touched with some light \nlines of fear lest he subject himself to criticism. I rapidly copied \nthe lines with my pencil, as he uttered them, and sent them for \ninsertion in the Observer, if you should think them worthy of \npreservation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Observer did consider them worth preserving, and they were \npublished on this day, September 13, 1845, becoming a beloved hymn.\u0014\n\u0014\nSweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\u0014\nThat calls me from a world of care,\u0014\nAnd bids me at my Father's throne\u0014\nMake all my wants and wishes known.\u0014\nIn seasons of distress and grief,\u0014\nMy soul has often found relief\u0014\nAnd oft escaped the tempter's snare\u0014\nBy thy return, sweet hour of prayer!\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the fact that he was blind and the few details recorded by \nThomas Salmon, we know little of William Walford. But his hymn, Sweet \nHour of Prayer has touched hundreds of thousands of lives on both \nsides of the Atlantic, expressing the genuine joy he found in prayer.\u0014",

    "words": "Scripture and Tradition in the Orthodox Church\u0014\nJames Stamoolis\u0014\n\u0014\nORTHODOXY AS THE TRUE CHURCH\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of being the true Christian church is the dominant theme \nof Eastern Christendom. Orthodoxy is the Church of Christ on earth. \nThere is a strong, even overpowering sense of tradition that envelops \nthe whole body of believers.2 This awareness is a mark that affects \neverything about the church. Panagiotis Bratsiotis asserts that the \nfundamental principle of Orthodoxy is the idea that the Orthodox \nChurch adheres to the principles and piety of early, undivided \nCatholic Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox, the early church was steadfastly \ndevoted to holy tradition and therefore this is an essential \ncharacteristic that must be maintained. We derive our knowledge of \nthe teaching of the Christian Religion from Holy Scripture and Sacred \nTradition, which we therefore call the sources of our Religion. It \nis thus a treasure that must be carefully guarded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere have been overtures from Protestant Churches to the Easter \nChurch since the Reformation. None has been successful at bringing \nabout union, any more than the attempts at union in the waning \ncenturies of the Bzyantine Empire when the East sought the military \nmight of the West. All have floundered on the exclusivistic claims of \nthe Orthodox Church. At the heart of these claims is the position \nthat the Orthodox Church and only the Orthodox Church has guarded the \ndeposit of divine truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE TWO SOURCES OF REVELATION\u0014\n\u0014\nThe official position of the Orthodox Church is stated very \ndistinctly in several places. The 1962 Almanac of the Greek \nArchdiocese of North and South America contains the following \nstatement:\u0014\n\u0014\nEternal truths are expressed in the Holy Scriptures and the Sacred \nTradition, both of which are equal and are represented pure and \nunadulterated by the true Church established by Christ to continue \nHis mission: mans salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Greek Orthodox Catechism, Divine Revelation is identified as \nthe source from which Christianity draws all its truths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs, however, those things which God revealed to man were promulgated \neither from mouth to mouth, or by the written word, we say, \ntherefore, that Christianity has two sources: the oral Divine \nRevelation or Holy Tradition, and the written Divine Revelation or \nHoly Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile all revelation comes from God so that one can speak of a single \ndivine source or single Christian tradition, there is still the \nconcept of the two channels in which this revelation reaches the \nchurch. Indeed according to the Orthodox Church, it is imperative to \nthink in terms of these two channels because not everything necessary \nfor salvation can be found in Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nArchbishop Michael clearly expresses this point of view when he \nwrites,  there exist in Tradition elements which, although not \nmentioned in the New Testament as they are in the Church today, are \nindispensable to the salvation of our souls. An example is how \ntradition supplies the words of invocation at the Eucharist. Without \nthese words,  It is impossible to have the sacred mystery of the \nEucharist; but without the mystery  there is no salvation for the \nsoul.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrthodox theologians are in agreement that there is no conflict \nexisting between the two sources. Instead, the two sources are viewed \nas complementary. The whole content of Christian tradition provides \nthe dogmatic base for the church. The Bible is part of this \noverarching tradition. The several components of the tradition are \nalso expressions of the source of ultimate authority, the Triune God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe content of the tradition is found in the decisions of the Seven \nEcumenical Councils, certain local or regional councils, the \nstatements of individual bishops, the Fathers, the Liturgy, canon law \nand icons. Of the above, the Ecumenical Councils have irrevocable \nauthority. However the process of acceptance of a council as \necumenical was by no means automatic. The Council of Nicaea (325) was \nnot recognized for more than fifty years, but it later became the \nsymbol of what an ecumenical council was to be. The Council of \nEphesus (449), which was declared to be ecumenical, was later \nrepudiated. How does one determine which councils are ecumenical? The \nfinal judge of a council is the Holy Spirit. This is because any \ncouncil which truly represents the church and is gathered together in \nthe name of Christ will certainly be inspired by the Holy, Spirit \nand will therefore be infallible. The Spirit expresses himself \nthrough the church. Thus we can speak of the church recognizing this \nor that council to be ecumenical. The period of the Ecumenical \nCouncils has great significance for Orthodoxy. It is regarded as a \nnormative period because not only were the great dogmatical forms \ndetermined, but also the basis of the canon law was laid down.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE ROLE OF TRADITION AS THE INTERPRETER OF HOLY SCRIPTURE\u0014\n\u0014\nEastern Orthodoxy considers the Bible to be the possession of the \nchurch. Therefore it follows that the church, not the Bible, has \nfinal authority. The Bible is only one aspect of the deposit of \ndivine revelation given to the church. As the guardian of this divine \nrevelation, the church has the sole right and obligation to interpret \nand convey the message of the Bible. The Church alone can interpret \nHoly Scripture with authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has always been admitted that there are portions of the Scriptures \nthat are unclear. Within the Bible itself, a warning is given against \nthose who would use the sacred text for their own ends. However, it \nappears that the churchs right of interpretation covers not only \nwhat might be considered obscure passages, but covers the whole text. \nOrthodox, when they read the Scripture, accept the guidance of the \nChurch.14 Ware cites as his authority the Confession of Dositheus. \nThis seventeenth century document arose out of the conflict between \ntraditional Orthodoxy and the Calvinistic party of Cyril Lucar. It \nis admitted by Orthodox theologians that the reaction to Calvinism \nborrowed from Roman Catholic sources. And while Dositheus is regarded \nas being Orthodox in spirit, he did employ Latin terminology in his \nConfession. Ware refers to Article II in the Confession of Dositheus \nwhich is in essential agreement with the Tridentine degree. Phillip \nSchaff gives the following summary of the article:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Holy Scriptures must be interpreted, not by private judgment but \nin accordance with the tradition of the Catholic Church, which can \nnot err, or deceive, or be deceived, and is of equal authority with \nthe Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be remembered that this confession was a point by point \nrefutation of the confession of faith circulated under the name of \nCyril Lucar. Article II of Lucars confession maintained that the \nauthority of the Scriptures is superior to that of the church. In his \nsecond edition, the perpicuity of Scriptures in matters of faith is \ndeclared.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo things should be clear. The first is that the Orthodox Church \nclearly rejected the Reformation position of the authority of the \nScriptures. The overwhelming sentiment against such views is \nindicated by the three-fold anathema pronounced by the Synod of \nJerusalem (1762) against the heretical Calvinistic doctrines.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second point to note is that the Confession of Dositheus holds to \na two source theory. Both Scripture and tradition are necessary for a \ncorrect understanding of the Orthodox faith. The problem is what is \nthe relationship between them. How does tradition serve as an \ninterpreter of the Scripture? To answer this question, we must look \nat the hermeneutical principles used by the Orthodox Church. It is an \nexceedingly difficult area to investigate but there are some \nimportant distinctions made by Orthodox scholars. Writing in The \nGreek Orthodox Theological Review, Nikos Nissiotis attempts to offer \naid in the area of the prolegoma to hermeneutics. He outlines several \nkey principles that the Orthodox believer must take into account \nbefore entering the complexities of the hermeneutical problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nNissiotis deals with the key issue of authority. His conclusion is \nthat the authority belongs to the church, but that this authority \nrelies on the believing community, both clergy and laity. What \nsignificance does this have for exegisis? This presents an entirely \ndifferent question from the question faced by the West, in both the \nRoman Catholic and the Protestant churches. The discussion about \nauthority or the guarantee of right biblical exegesis is foreign to \nthe Orthodox Church. The conception of exegesis is totally different. \nNissiotis attempts to express the Orthodox hermeneutical principles \nregarding authority in the following way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Orthodox regard exegeses as an offering of the whole community, \nas the voice of the Church in a given situation, a reinterpretation \nwhich helps the believers struggling in this world and for this world \nto readapt the message of the Gospel to a new situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is really the key to the Orthodox Churchs concept of the unity \nof tradition and Scripture. Everything revolves around the concept of \nthe church as a whole being the guardian of truth. Therefore the \nother principles that must be believed before the problem of \nhermeneutics is discussed all revolve around the church. For example, \nNissiotis does not want hermeneutics left as the exclusive domain of \nNew Testament scholars and exegetes. He feels that the specialist is \nmore concerned with the methodological problem and does not pay \nattention to the other uses of the Bible, if only for their \ndevotional or liturgical life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus everything is arranged around the ecclesiological presupposition \nwhich views the church as the ultimate authority on earth. \nFurthermore, the church is the central focus of all Christian work. \nAll the gifts of the Spirit were given to enable her to be \nstrengthened. However, the prophetic charisma was not exercised by \nPaul on the question of receiving Gentiles into the Church until he \nhad received the unanimous support of the Church in Jerusalem (Ac. \n15:22). Nissiotis sees this approach to be a key principle in \nhermenutics. This phrase Then it seemed good to the apostles and \nelders, with the whole church, must be the basis for all efforts to \nbuild up the Christian community and interpret the Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe needs of the witnessing communtiy are met by the application and \ninterpretation of Scripture. The task is undertaken for the purpose \nof meeting these needs and the church as a whole is responsible for \nthis task.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuidelines can be drawn according to this ecclesiological principle \nwhen there are apparent contradictions between the biblical authors. \nThe problem of interpreting the whole of revelation is for the \nOrthodox not a problem of systematizing the various scriptural \npassages. In fact nothing could be farther from the spirit of \nOrthodoxy. The Bible is not regarded as giving a blueprint for \norganization or a systematic exposition of moral teaching or dogmatic \ntheology. The Bible is the book of life of the Ecclesia, it does not \ndictate to it rules of behaviour and canon laws. Rather the Bible is \nthe revelation of God in history, dealing more with the acts of God \nand the Christian community. This should not be construed to mean \nthat the Orthodox are not concerned with the revelation of \nprepositional truth, for they most certainly are. It only means that \nwith reference to the Bible, there is no systematic presentation of \nthis truth.22\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lack of a systematic framework in the Bible is balanced by the \nunity that is established with tradition. Since the Spirit that \ninspired the Bible also inspires the church in its tradition, any \nlogical contradictions or apparent deficiencies are eliminated. This \nview follows logically from the Othodox Churchs position on the \nBible. Therefore, tradition and Scripture are a team, both working \ntogether for the salvation of humankind, both vital parts of the \nChristian community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe appeal to tradition as an interpreter of Scripture apparently \narose out of the needs of the early church. In the controversies with \nvarious heretics, those who were orthodox, i.e. those who held the \ntraditional view, needed some source to reinforce their \ninterpretation of the Scripture. An appeal to the Bible seemed to be \ninsufficient because the heretics cited scriptural passages to \nsupport their positions. For example, the Arians claimed their view \nwas biblical. But one can go back even earlier for the problem did \nnot arise for the first time in the fourth century. In the second \ncentury Gnostics, Sabellians and Montonists also appealed to the \nBible. Who was to decide the issue? What were the principles of \ninterpretation?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in this historical situation that the authority of Tradition \nwas first invoked. Scripture belonged to the Church, and it was only \nin the Church, within the community of right faith, that Scripture \ncould be adequately understood and correctly interpreted. Heretics, \nthat is those outside of the Church, had no key to the mind of the \nScripture. It was not enough just to read and to quote scriptural \nwordsthe true meaning or intent, of scripture, taken as an \nintegrated whole, had to be elicited.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the church which has the true meaning of Scripture alone could \ninterpret the Scripture. This meaning was contained in the apostolic \ntradition which the church preserved. Florovsky points out that for \nthe Fathers, Scripture and tradition were always connected. Without \nthe correct rule of interpretation, the Bible was merely words; \ntradition supplies the key to interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith tradition playing such a vital role in the understanding of the \nfaith, it is obvious that the bearer of tradition is charged with an \nexceedingly important role. The church is therefore central in the \ntask of exegesis. However, the early Fathers, for example, \nTertullian, did not claim authority for the church. As Florovsky \nexpresses it:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church was not an external authority, which had to judge over the \nScripture, but rather the keeper and guardian of that Divine Truth \nwhich was stored and deposited in Holy Writ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt can be seen that quite early in the history of the church the \nquestion of tradition came up. The appeal to the continuity with the \napostolic faith is understandable. It is always the appeal of those \nwishing to underscore their link with the past. There is little \nproblem in applying this principle when one of the opposing parties \nclaims a new revelation. The problem becomes more difficult when both \nsides appeal to the ancient tradition and both claim to be the lineal \ndescendants of the earlier custodians of the faith. For this reason, \nboth Protestants and the Roman Catholics attempted to discover in the \nEastern Orthodox Church elements that would support their respective \npositions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe replies of Jeremiah II to the Lutheran Reformers (157381) have \ntaken on a confession or dogmatic significance in the Orthodox \nChurch. Jeremiah II was the first official Orthodox response to the \nReformation. Jeremiah II calls on the Lutherans to return to the true \nfaith as found in the Orthodox Church. He broke off the \ncorrespondence when the Lutherans persisted in seeking his \nrecognition of the validity of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Reformers, from the Othodox point of view, were correct in \nappealing to the Orthodox Church. From the Orthodox point of view \nthey, unlike the Western Church, preserved the true tradition. The \nchurch would have ceased to have been the church if she had departed \nfrom the holy tradition. It is the very historical continuity with \nthe early church that marks Orthodoxy as the true faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result of the Orthodox Churchs stand is to weld the Scripture to \nthe tradition preserved in the church. One can speak of tradition \nstanding over the Scripture, because the meaning of Scripture can be \nunlocked only by the key of tradition. Therefore, the hermeneutical \nbond between the two sources of faith, Scripture and tradition, in \neffect produces the single source that modern Orthodox theologians \nare so fond of speaking of as Christian tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nTRADITION: THE TESTS OF AUTHENTICITY\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat constitutes authentic tradition? There are some criteria which \nthe church used in determining the dogmatic symbols. For the most \npart, the criteria reflect the general acceptance of the symbol by a \nsignificant section of the church or its production by a recognized \nheirarch. But it must always be remembered that these doctrinal \nstatements while new are held by the Orthodox to be only \nexplications of what had already been held.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore there are not what might be called new doctrines \nexpressed in the church. The central tenets, for example, those \ndefined by Ecumenical Councils must be adhered to by all Orthodox. \nThis is not because Ecumenical Councils are the supreme authority, \nbut because the decrees of Ecumenical Councils have been recognized \nand witnessed by the whole church. It is precisely this universal \nrecognition that makes a council ecumenical. As Bratsiotis expresses \nit:  the decisive criterion of an Ecumenical Council is the \nrecognition of its decrees by the whole Church, which is therefore in \nfact the sole authority in Orthodoxy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the only authority, the church does have the role of deciding what \nis authentic tradition. Two facts must be noted at this point. The \nfirst is that there can be legitimate local tradition that does not \nhave universal authority. In other words, national churches have the \nright to maintain certain practices that differ from other Orthodox \nChurches. The unity of the Orthodox Christians is not a unity of \nlanguage, liturgical rite or baptismal creed. Rather the unity is a \nunity of faith which the national churches express in their own \nlanguages and rites. This is a freedom that the East rejoices in and \nis considered to be a fundamental characteristic of Orthodoxy.\u0014\n\u0014\nStrict conformity in matters of liturgical practices has never been \nconsidered to be a real obstacle to the reunion of the East and West. \nMeyendorff cites several important thinkers such as Photius, \nPatriarch of Constantinople (858886), and Peter, Patriarch of \nAntioch (105256), who considered local practices, even those defined \nby local conciliar decrees, as matters of indifference. These \npractices in no way affected the unity of the faith. The main problem \ndividing East and West was seen in the doctrinal question of the \nprocession of the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the central faith there remains room for the local practice to \nshine through, creating what might be considered a unique and \nexpressive worship experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second point to note is that there seem to be two tests to \ndetermine authentic tradition. The two are 1) apostolicity: the \ndoctrine comes from the apostles who in turn received it directly \nfrom the Lord, and 2) the concept of the universal acceptance on the \npart of the church, that is, decisions considered to be ecumenical \nbecause of recognition by the whole church. It is incorrect to view \nthese doctrines as opposed to each other because no Orthodox \ntheologian does so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn illustration of the concept of apostolicity is found in an article \nby Archbishop Michael in which he refers to the tradition received \nfrom the apostles orally. This same tradition was handed on from \ngeneration to generation until it was embodied and codified in the \nworks of the major Fathers of the Church and in the resolutions of \nthe seven Ecumenical Councils and the ten local Synods of the \nChurch. There is no thought here of enlarging or changing the \ndeposit of tradition. The Archbishop speaks against those who ignore \nor repudiate tradition (i.e. Protestants) and those who enlarge and \nadd to tradition (i.e. Roman Catholics). Orthodoxy is seen to hold a \nmiddle-of-the-road-policy by neither adding to or subtracting from \nthe apostolic tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sentiment expressed by Archbishop Michael is common in the \nOrthodox Church which is by self definition the church of tradition. \nHowever, there is another test of the authenticity of tradition that \ncan be employed but has not been used in recent history. This is the \ntest of universal acceptance by the church. As has been shown above, \nthis does not mean conformity in practice or liturgical rite, but in \nmatters of faith.33 The concept of universal recognition and \nacceptance by the church determines which councils are recognized by \nthe Orthodox as ecumenical.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the concept of universal acceptance as a test of tradition, it \nseems cleat that the interpretation of the Faith of the church rests \nwith the church as a whole. Indeed, this is the Orthodox position. \nThe whole church is the guardian of orthodoxy, not just the \nhierarchy. However, it has been the normal practice for the laity to \ndelegate this authority, knowingly or unknowingly, to the hierarchy. \nThe bishop is the representative of Christ in the Eucharistic \ngathering and is the symbol of the authority of the church. There is \nboth a blessing and a problem in the delegation of the authority of \nthe believers to the ecclesiastical leadership. The blessing is the \nhistorical continuity of the traditions and customs. The problem is \nthat the life of the Holy Spirit who indwells all believers is not \nfree to express the full dimensions of the Christian life. Form \nrather than personal experience inside the form comes to dominate the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps this is the central problem of tradition. It both preserves \nthe past experiences and understandings of the people of God and does \nhamper the ongoing work of the Spirit in the believing community. The \nwork of the Spirit in both preservation and freedom of expression \nmust be kept in creative tension so that the voice of God in todays \nsituation can be heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the interpretation of the faith can and must move beyond the \nelements that have been handed down, because the church herself is a \nliving body. The Orthodox Church has suffered a decline in attendance \n(but not necessarily membership) in a country like Greece because the \nchurch is not perceived to be relevant to the secularized society. \nThe church is respected as a preserver of culture and for the witness \nof the church to the oppressors in the past, but is not thought to be \nrelevant to today. It will be interesting to see if the same \nphenomena occurs in the former Soviet Union. The challenge is for the \nchurch to keep the Faith once delivered and make it speak to todays \nworld. Some Orthodox maintain that the Byzantine liturgies are \ntimeless and neither can nor should be changed. Other Orthodox speak \nof the need for liturgical reform to make the services more \nacceptable in terms of length.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some interest among the Orthodox in sorting out true \ntradition from what might be called human traditions. A hierarchy of \ntradition exists in the Orthodox Church. It is recognized that not \neverything from the past is of equal value. The elements that have \nunique authority are the Bible, the Creed, and the doctrinal \ndefinitions of the Ecumenical Councils. The decrees of the Synod of \nJassy (which ratified the Confession of Peter Moghila) and of the \nSynod of Jerusalem (which ratified the Confession of Dositheus) are \nnot considered to be on the same level with the earlier statements. \nThis is not because they are later and thus past the age of the \nFathers, but because at the time they were composed Orthodoxy was in \nan uneven struggle with the West. Some theologians blame the problem \non Moslem conquest and interference. It was not Orthodoxy at her best \nwhich met the challenges of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. \nThis frank admission of foreign elements in the seventeenth century \ndoctrinal statements may provide an opportunity for dialogue with \nEvangelicals. However, it should be realized that while the \nformulations of the seventeenth century are not in the fullest spirit \nof the Eastern Church, the Orthodox nevertheless attribute to them \nconfessional status.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer role as the true church and guardian of tradition lays upon \nEastern Orthodoxy the duty to examine what has been handed down. \nAntiquity is not to be confused with truth. Not everything received \nfrom the past is to be accepted. One of the bishops at the Council of \nCarthage (257) reminded his fellows that The Lord said, I am truth. \nHe did not say, I am custom. Human opinions or mere custom must be \nseparated from the authentic deposit of tradition. To do this means \nthat the past must be critically reexamined. There is a growing \nawareness of the need for historical studies by Orthodox theologians.\u0014\n\u0014\nCAN THE DEPOSIT OF TRUTH CHANGE?\u0014\n\u0014\nCan tradition ever be modified? The answer is yes and no. Dealing \nwith the no first, it is the position of the Orthodox Church that \nthey have preserved the faith handed down. They believe that they \nhave not tampered with the sacred deposit, having neither added \nanything, nor subtracted anything. Therefore, it is obvious that \nhaving preserved the true faith for nearly 2000 years, they will \nhardly consider tampering with it now.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see MyDocuments/Scripture and Tradition in the \nOrothodox Church\u0014",

    "title": "SYNOD DEPOSTED POPE JOHN XII",
    "words": "Synod Deposed Pope John XII\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThings did not look good for Pope John XII in the winter of 963. The \ncorrupt young man had become pope through the influence of his \nfather, Alberic, ruler of Rome. Before his death, Alberic made civic \nleaders swear at St. Peter's altar that they would make his son \nOctavius pope at the first vacancy. The leaders loved the dying \nfather and kept their word to him better than the son would keep his \nword to anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nElected pope at the age of eighteen, Octavius changed his name to \nJohn, becoming the first pope to change his name on taking office. \nWith his election to the highest office of the western church, John \nwas ruler over spiritual and civil matters in Rome. A man more unfit \nfor the task of leading Christendom could hardly be imagined. He \npreferred battles to Bible study, hunting to holiness and was a \nnotorious adulterer and liar. The prestige of the papacy plummeted.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnemies defeated him in battle and occupied lands that belonged to \nthe popes. John made a deal with Otto I, king of the Germans. He \npledged allegeiance to Otto and crowned him emperor of the Holy Roman \nEmpire. In return, Otto promised to recognize only John as pope. The \ntwo agreed that from then on popes would pledge themselves to the \nemperor. Nonetheless, Otto pleaded with John to reform his wicked \nways.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo sooner had Otto left Rome in February 962 than John was sorry he \nhad given up some of the pope's authority to Otto. He began a \ntreacherous correspondence with the emperor's enemies and tried to \nincite them to war against Otto. The emperor intercepted the letters. \nAstonished at John's treachery, he subdued the rebel provinces and \nmarched back to Rome. John fled.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto gathered the leaders of the church into a synod (local church \ncouncil) which met on November 6. Its fifty Italian and German \nbishops summoned John to defend himself against charges of adultery, \nincest, murder, perjury, sacrilege, and simony (selling church \noffices). John refused to appear. Instead, he wrote in his poor \ngrammar, saying, \"To all the bishops--We hear that you wish to make \nanother pope. If you do I excommunicate you by almighty God and you \nhave no power to ordain no one or celebrate mass.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnmoved, the synod proceeded with its hearings. The emperor himself \ntestified against John. With the emperor's consent, the synod removed \nJohn from office on this day, December 4, 963. In his place, they \nchose a layman named Leo. But Leo VIII's election was improper by \nexisting standards. Nonetheless, Leo ruled until the following year. \nWith Otto gone, John recaptured Rome and cut off the hands, ears and \nnoses of several foes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut John's hourglass was about out of sand.

    "title": "SPEAK FREELY, WITHOUT FEAR",
    "words": "John Leland, James Madison and the Bill of Rights\u0014\nReed Ricardi\u0014\n\u0014\nIn early America dissenting Baptists played a key role in the fight \nfor religious liberty and the disestablishment of state churches. But \nwhile many Baptists fought for liberty for themselves, only a few \nfought for religious liberty for everyone. John Leland was one of \nthose few. Leland was not only the most prominent Baptist but also \nthe most prominent religious figure of the founding era to champion \nuniversal religious freedom. He was an energetic and popular \npreacher, witty writer, friend to presidents, and chauffer of a \nMammoth Cheese, who radically advocated for freedom for \nProtestants, Catholics, Jews, Pagans, Muslims, Atheists, and slaves. \nThe legacy of John Leland includes his influence on James Madison and \nthe Bill of Rights, his delivery of a letter and a 1,235-pound wheel \nof cheese to Thomas Jefferson (and Jeffersons famous reply to the \nDanbury Baptists), and finally his fight against Sabbath legislation \nin early-nineteenth-century America.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn and raised in Grafton Massachusetts, John Leland was baptized in \n1774 at the age of 20 after experiencing a religious awakening. Just \na few weeks later Leland attended Sunday services at a church where \nthere was no preacher and reluctantly stood up to preach. The sermon \nbegan shakily, but he improved as it went on. Afterward the \ncongregation encouraged the trembling young preacher, and that \nafternoon Leland surrendered himself to the work of the ministry, \nwithout any condition, evasion, or mental reservation. Leland \nimmediately began preaching in nearby towns and worked tirelessly for \nthe rest of his life to save souls and preach the gospel. Over the \ncourse of the next 67 years Leland would (according to his own \nrecords) preach more than 8,000 sermons, baptize 1,524 people, and \ntravel enough in his labors to circumnavigate the globe three times.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter spreading the Baptist message in Virginia as an itinerant \npreacher, Leland settled down in 1778 with his new wife, Sally \nDevine, in Orange County, Virginia.For the next 13 years they would \nreside only 10 miles from James Madisons Montpelier and 30 miles \nfrom Thomas Jeffersons Monticello. Leland was very active in \nVirginia, often preaching 12 or 14 times a week, founding several \nchurches and serving at a half dozen others in surrounding counties. \nThe respected early Baptist historian Robert Semple wrote that Mr. \nLeland, as a preacher, was probably the most popular of any who ever \nresided in [Virginia].\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the years leading up to the Revolution, to the dismay of the \nestablished Anglican Church, the Baptist revivalists met with \ntremendous success in Virginia.But that success came at a price. \nBaptist preachers were beaten, harassed by mobs, and arrested, not \nonly as disturbers of the peace but also because they refused to \napply to authorities for licenses to preach (the Baptist preachers, \nincluding Leland, thought it idolatry to apply to a civil power for \nthe right to preach Gods Word). The evangelical dissenters turned to \npolitical measures to protect their freedoms and found champions in \nsuch secular intellectuals as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. By \nthe time Leland began his ministry in Virginia there was already \nprecedence of political activism among the increasingly influential \nBaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaking advantage of his popularity as a preacher, Leland used writing \nto advocate for religious freedom.He wrote about religion and \nreligious liberty with a forceful style and sharp wit. Two passages \nfrom Lelands writing while in Virginia will serve as representative \nof the whole. In The Virginia Chronicle, published in 1790, Leland \nwrote that the notion of a Christian commonwealth should be exploded \nforever. . . . Government should protect every man in thinking and \nspeaking freely, and see that one does not abuse another. The liberty \nI contend for is more than toleration. The very idea of toleration is \ndespicable; it supposes that some have a preeminence above the rest, \nto grant indulgence, whereas all should be equally free, Jews, Turks, \nPagans and Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nLelands treatise The Rights of Conscience Inalienable, published on \nJanuary 1, 1791 (the year he moved back to Massachusetts), was his \nmost famous and influential work. The following is an excerpt.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs conformity of sentiments in matters of religion essential to the \nhappiness of civil government? Not at all. Government has no more to \ndo with the religious opinions of men than it has with the principles \nof mathematics. Let every man speak freely without fearmaintain the \nprinciples that he believesworship according to his own faith, \neither one God, three Gods, no God, or twenty Gods; and let \ngovernment protect him in so doing, i.e., see that he meets with no \npersonal abuse or loss of property for his religious opinions. \nInstead of discouraging him with proscriptions, fines, confiscation \nor death, let him be encouraged, as a free man, to bring forth his \narguments and maintain his points with all boldness; then if his \ndoctrine is false it will be confuted, and if it is true (though ever \nso novel) let others credit it. . . . Truth disdains the aid of law \nfor its defenseit will stand upon its own merits. . . . It is error, \nand error alone, that needs human support.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeland himself played an influential role in the opposition to \nPatrick Henrys general assessment bill in 1784, and in the \ndisestablishment of the state church in Virginia (and later in \nMassachusetts and Connecticut). But perhaps his greatest contribution \nto religious liberty was his role in the ratification of the federal \nConstitution by Virginia and Madisons guarantee of a Bill of Rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe federal Constitution, drafted by James Madison, was voted by the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. But \nwith strong opposition from the Anti-Federalists, the ratification of \nthe Constitution by the states was no sure thing. One of the \nprinciple objections by the Anti-Federalists was that it did not \ninclude a Bill of Rights.Madison himself supported the ideals of a \nBill of Rights but did not believe their inclusion in the \nConstitution was necessary (instead he believed that individual \nrights were implicit in the Constitution, all powers not expressly \ngiven to the federal government being retained by the people). \nVirginia, the largest, most populous, and perhaps most important \nstate politically, was also home to a majority of the most prominent \nand influential Anti-Federalists (George Mason, James Monroe, Richard \nHenry Lee, and Patrick Henry). At the time it was widely believed \nthat ratification in Virginia was absolutely essential for the \nConstitution to succeed.Almost immediately after the convention in \nPhiladelphia, Baptists in Virginia and other states began opposing \nthe Constitution, not because of what it stated, but because of what \nit did not state. On March 7, 1788, the Virginia Baptist General \nCommittee, led by John Leland, met to discuss the proposed \nConstitution. They voted a resolution which in part stated that we \nthe Virginia Baptist General Committee unanimously hold that the new \nfederal constitution, proposed to the States for their ratification, \ndoes not make sufficient provision for the secure enjoyment of \nreligious liberty; and therefore it should be amended to make such a \nprovision.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Madison was in New York attending Congress and writing the \nFederalist Papers when he learned through numerous letters of the \nstrength of the Anti-Federalists in Virginia as well as the Baptist \nopposition to ratification. On February 17, 1788, Madison received a \nletter warning him that several of those who have much weight with \nthe people are opposed to ratification. John Leland was one of three \nindividuals mentioned by name. Madison decided to return to Virginia \nto run as a candidate for the ratification convention. While passing \nthrough Fredericksburg on his return trip, Madison received a letter \nfrom Captain Joseph Spencer that described the Baptist opposition to \nratification and urged Madison to spend a few hours talking with \nJohn Leland on his way home to Montpelier. Enclosed in the letter was \na copy of 10 objections to the Constitution written by John Leland. \nLelands principle objections were that the Constitution contained no \nBill of Rights and did not adequately secure religious freedom but \nleft it in the hands of the president and Congress.\u0014\n\u0014\nUndoubtably Madison took Spencers advice, and went to see Leland. \nThe two reportedly met on March 23, 1788 (the day before the \nelection), at Gum Springs, near Lelands home. In the meeting Madison \nis said to have pledged his support for a Bill of Rights, and in turn \nLeland pledged his support for Madison and the ratification of the \nConstitution. Leland and the Baptists did indeed support Madison, who \nwas elected the next day to the Virginia Ratifying Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Virginia Ratifying Convention in Richmond, Patrick Henry and \nGeorge Mason had the oratorical advantage and used it to strongly \noppose ratification. But Madison, the Constitutions author, argued \ninfluentially for a republican government established by a \nconstitution in which mutually accountable branches of government \nwere grounded in the people without hereditary office. The vote was \ntaken on June 25, 1788, and by a margin of 89 to 79, the Constitution \nwas ratified by Virginia. Included in the vote was a recommendation \nfor the addition of a Bill of Rights. New York soon followed \nVirginias example and voted to ratify. The tide had turned: the \nConstitution and the Federalists had carried the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 4, 1789, just four days after Washingtons inauguration, \nMadison declared his intention to propose amendments to the \nConstitution. On June 9, 1789, in an address to Congress, Madison \nformally proposed the amendments. In the outline of his notes for the \naddress Madison wrote Bill of Rightsusefulnot essential.Though \nMadison did not see the Bill of Rights as essential, he knew that \nothers did.In his address he said: It cannot be a secret to the \ngentlemen in this house that . . . there is a great number of our \nconstituents who are dissatisfied with [the Constitution]. . . . \nThere is a great body of the people falling under this description, \nwho at present feel much inclined to join their support to the cause \nof federalism, if they were satisfied in this one point.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadison clearly had his constituents like John Leland in mind.He went \non to argue that the amendments would prove that the trust in him and \nthe other Federalists was not misplaced, and that the Federalists \nwere indeed friends to liberty. Madison not only proposed the \namendments to Congress but championed them throughout the legislative \nprocess. Leland and his fellow Baptists had their way, when, on \nDecember 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights came into effect as \nconstitutional amendments, and liberty was made more secure. \nHistorian Gordon Wood writes that there is no question that it was \nMadisons personal prestige and his dogged persistence that saw the \namendments through the Congress. There might have been a federal \nConstitution without Madison, but certainly no Bill of Rights. \nWithout Madison there might not have been a Bill of Rights, and \nwithout Leland, Madison may never have been their champion. May we \nnot forget the impact that religious and religious liberty-minded \npeople like John Leland had in shaping our nation during that crucial \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nArticle Author: Reed Richardi\u0014\n Reed Richardi writes from New Market, Virginia.\u0014",

    "words": "Sundar Singh's Vision of Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nFourteen year old Sundar Singh blamed the Christian God for the death \nof his mother. He threw filth on his Christian teachers, mocked their \nScriptures, and interrupted classes. Then he made an ultimate gesture \nof scorn. He built a fire and page by page tore up a Bible and burned \nit. \"Although I believed that I had done a very good deed by burning \nthe Bible, I felt unhappy,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin three days Sundar Singh could bear his misery no longer. Late \nat night, on this day December 19, 1903,* he rose and prayed that God \nreveal himself if he really existed. Otherwise he would throw himself \nin front of the train which passed by his house. For seven hours \nSundar Singh prayed. \"O God, if there is a God, reveal thyself to me \ntonight.\" The next train was due at five o'clock in the morning. The \nhours passed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly the room filled with a glow. A man appeared before him. \nSundar heard a voice say, \"How long will you deny me? I died for you; \nI have given my life for you.\" He saw the man's hands, pierced by \nnails.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn that moment he recognized Christ. The boy who had burned the Bible \nbecame a man who would endure terrible sufferings for Jesus. He made \ntwenty trips into Tibet, where he met severe persecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut first, Sundar had to face his own people. The Sikhs had endured \nserious opposition in their early history. As a consequence they were \nfiercely loyal to their faith. Conversion to Christianity was \nconsidered treachery. Every effort was made to woo or coerce Sundar \nSingh back to his ancestral faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis father pleaded. An uncle opened a cellar full of treasures. A \nprince appealed to the boy's patriotism. His own brother spread lies \nabout him. His former gang hurled muck at him. The mission was \nattacked. Christians were denied service. A boy who followed Sundar \nSingh was poisoned to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally Sundar realized he must break with his people. He cut off the \nhair he had worn long like every Sikh. Then he was told, \"We reject \nyou forever... We shall forget you as if you had never been born. You \nwill leave this house with nothing but the clothes you wear on your \nback. ...\" When painful cramps wrenched his gut, he realized that his \nfamily had poisoned his last meal. He staggered to a mission hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his recovery, he donned the yellow robe of India's holy men. \nUnlike many gurus, he kept himself clean and did not torture his \nbody. Dressed in his thin yellow robe, Sundar took to the road, \npreaching the gospel of Christ. Over the years, many were won to \nfaith through him. Even his own father was converted. But in 1929, a \nsickly Sundar set out for Tibet. He never returned. Nothing was heard \nfrom him again. He disappeared from history.\u0014\n\u0014\n*The most trustworthy biography gives this date. Others place this \nconversion as early as December 6th and as late as 1904.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrews, C. F. Sadhu Sundar Singh; a personal memoir.

    "words": "Inuit\u0014\nThese people generally are offended by the name \"Eskimo\" and prefer \nthe name \"inuit\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuicide, murder, and death among the Inuit\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther information: Suicide in Greenland and Suicide among Canadian \naboriginal people\u0014\nA pervasive European myth about Inuit is that they killed elderly \n(senicide) and \"unproductive people\",[102] but this is not generally \ntrue.[103][104][105] In a culture with an oral history, elders are \nthe keepers of communal knowledge, effectively the community \nlibrary.[106] Because they are of extreme value as the repository of \nknowledge, there are cultural taboos against sacrificing \nelders.[107][108]\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Antoon A. Leenaars' book Suicide in Canada he states that \n\"Rasmussen found that the death of elders by suicide was a \ncommonplace among the Iglulik Inuit\".[109]\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Franz Boas, suicide was \"not of rare occurrence\" and was \ngenerally accomplished through hanging.[110] Writing of the Labrador \nInuit, Hawkes (1916) was considerably more explicit on the subject of \nsuicide and the burden of the elderly:\u0014\n\u0014\nAged people who have outlived their usefulness and whose life is a \nburden both to themselves and their relatives are put to death by \nstabbing or strangulation. This is customarily done at the request of \nthe individual concerned, but not always so. Aged people who are a \nhindrance on the trail are abandoned.\u0014\n\u0014\nAntoon A. Leenaars, Suicide in Canada[111]\u0014\nWhen food is not sufficient, the elderly are the least likely to \nsurvive. In the extreme case of famine, the Inuit fully understood \nthat, if there was to be any hope of obtaining more food, a hunter \nwas necessarily the one to feed on whatever food was left. However, a \ncommon response to desperate conditions and the threat of starvation \nwas infanticide.[112][113] A mother abandoned an infant in hopes that \nsomeone less desperate might find and adopt the child before the cold \nor animals killed it. The belief that the Inuit regularly resorted to \ninfanticide may be due in part to studies done by Asen Balikci,[114] \nMilton Freeman[115] and David Riches[116] among the Netsilik, along \nwith the trial of Kikkik.[117][118] Other recent research has noted \nthat \"While there is little disagreement that there were examples of \ninfanticide in Inuit communities, it is presently not known the depth \nand breadth of these incidents. The research is neither complete nor \nconclusive to allow for a determination of whether infanticide was a \nrare or a widely practiced event.\"[119] There is no agreement about \nthe actual estimates of the frequency of newborn female infanticide \nin the Inuit population. Carmel Schrire mentions diverse studies \nranging from 1550% to 80%.[120]\u0014\n\u0014\nAnthropologists believed that Inuit cultures routinely killed \nchildren born with physical defects because of the demands of the \nextreme climate. These views were changed by late 20th century \ndiscoveries of burials at an archaeological site. Between 1982 and \n1994, a storm with high winds caused ocean waves to erode part of the \nbluffs near Barrow, Alaska, and a body was discovered to have been \nwashed out of the mud. Unfortunately the storm claimed the body, \nwhich was not recovered. But examination of the eroded bank indicated \nthat an ancient house, perhaps with other remains, was likely to be \nclaimed by the next storm. The site, known as the \"Ukkuqsi \narchaeological site\", was excavated. Several frozen bodies (now known \nas the \"frozen family\") were recovered, autopsies were performed, and \nthey were re-interred as the first burials in the then-new Imaiqsaun \nCemetery south of Barrow.[121] Years later another body was washed \nout of the bluff. It was a female child, approximately 9 years old, \nwho had clearly been born with a congenital birth defect.[122] This \nchild had never been able to walk, but must have been cared for by \nfamily throughout her life.[123] She was the best preserved body ever \nrecovered in Alaska, and radiocarbon dating of grave goods and of a \nstrand of her hair all place her back to about 1200 CE.[123]\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article is borrowed from Wikipedia.\u0014",

    "title": "SEMINARY HEADS WIDEN GAP WITH PEOPLE OF COLOR",
    "words": "SBC Seminary Heads Widen Gap with People of Color\u0014\nby Terrell Carter | Jan 4, 2021 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe presidents of the six Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) \nseminaries released a joint statement in late November dismissing \ncritical race theory (CRT) as incompatible with their understanding \nof the gospel and the 2000 Southern Baptist Convention Faith and \nMessage.\u0014\n\u0014\nCRT is an academic framework used to explain how social, legal, \npolitical and economic systems have been used to help certain people \ngroups in America while simultaneously hindering others.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir primary pushback against the theory is that Marxism is part of \nits foundation, thus making it atheistic.\u0014\n\u0014\nAside from the irony of six white seminary presidents dismissing an \nacademic theory that seeks to hold white leaders accountable when \nthey make decisions related to their relationships with people of \ncolor without input from those people of color, the joint statement \nfurther brings into focus the disconnect between white evangelical \nChristians and Christians of color.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the statement says that CRT has become an issue in the \nlarger world only in the past two years (2018-20). Ironically, that \ntimeframe coincides with a greater push for addressing the national \nconcerns of people of color, especially those related to their \nrelationships with law enforcement, lending institutions and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical denominations, like the SBC, fail to recognize their \nthoughts about theology and culture in many ways stand in direct \nopposition to the lived experiences of the people they say they want \nto be in relationship with.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people of color believe the social, legal, political and \neconomic systems in America have been used to keep them at a \ndisadvantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy contrast, many evangelicals believe that a persons life turns out \nthe way it does due to personal decisions made over time. Each person \nis solely responsible for how their lives turn out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following are four additional general characteristics of \n21st-century evangelical culture:\u0014\n\u0014\nIndividualism  Evangelicalism emphasizes a personal relationship \nwith Jesus through intellectual faith. One of the challenges inherent \nin this is the idea that the outcomes a person experiences are the \nresults of personal action.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-intellectualism  The assumption that critical thinking hinders \nthe gospel message of personal salvation, which can result in a \ntendency to simplify any argument down to aspects of a persons \npersonal salvation, rather than engaging in careful reflection to \nunderstand underlying issues more fully, such as historic classism \nand racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-structuralism  Evangelicals often emphasize personal \naccountability at the expense of understanding structural effects. \nThis leads to thinking that whatever may be wrong in a persons life \nis due solely to personal responsibility, and legal, institutional or \npolitical patterns do not have an effect.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblically based economic freedom  Evangelicals typically believe \nthe Bible teaches personal responsibility as it relates to economic \ncircumstances. They believe that individual actions carry the \ngreatest influence on a persons economic status.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the problems with this mode of thinking is the tendency to \nover-spiritualize most life circumstances in such a way that, even \nwhen the Gospels clearly show Jesus challenging his followers to \nunderstand and combat the systems that fostered discrimination, those \npassages become spiritualized or overlooked.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of following Jesus example of pushing back against the \nsystems that separate people into hierarchies based on race and \ngender, some evangelicals condemn efforts, like CRT, that seek to do \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis line of thinking does not enable or encourage people to see the \nbig pictures of structural racism, sexism, classism, other historic \nintentional inequalities and the effects each has on participants \nwithin our society.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could it if you believe that everything a person has experienced \nin life is based on personal action or inaction?\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not saying this type of thinking makes evangelicals or the SBC \nseminary presidents bad per se. But it does hinder them from \nunderstanding the experiences of people whose lives are vastly \ndifferent from their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, understanding others does not seem to be one of the \nprimary concerns of U.S. evangelicals or the SBC.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, it seems like the concerns are for people to affirm a system \nthat does not want to be challenged to think more critically about \nitself or those it says it wants to be in relationship with.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrell Carter, DMin, is a pastor and administrator in higher \neducation residing in St. Louis, Missouri.\u0014",

You go about lecturing, do you not?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, honey, that's what I do. The Lord has made me a sign unto this \nnation, an' I go round a'testifyin' an' showin' on 'em their sins \nagin my people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFascinated by Truth's stories and demeanor, Stowe called down several \nof the more well-known ministers at the party. When asked if she \npreached from the Bible, Truth said no, because she couldn't read.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I preaches,\" she said, \"I has just one text to preach from, an' \nI always preaches from this one. My text is, 'When I found Jesus.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, you couldn't have found a better one,\" said one of the \nministers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, Truth preached on more themes than thatabolition and \nwomen's rights to name twoand became one of the most celebrated and \ncontroversial itinerants of her era.\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn a slave named Isabella Baumfree in southeastern New York, the \nfuture abolitionist had several owners during her childhoodmany of \nthem cruelbefore ending up the property of John Dumont at age 13. \nFor 17 years, she worked for him and then escaped. She made her way \nto the home of Issac and Maria Van Wagenerwhose home she said God \nshowed her in a vision. The Quaker couple bought her from Dumont and \nthen freed her.\u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of years later, she had an experience that solidified her \nemerging faith. According to her dictated autobiography, one day \"God \nrevealed himself to her, with all the suddenness of a flash of \nlightning, showing her, 'in the twinkling of an eye, that he was all \nover,' that he pervaded the universe, 'and that there was no place \nwhere God was not.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I jes' walked round an' round in a dream,\" the former slave later \ntold Stowe. \"Jesus loved me! I knowed it, I felt it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch Finance\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring her early years, though, her faith was confused, and at one \npoint she joined a cult whose leader eventually murdered one of the \nmembers; for another period, she followed the Millerites, who \npredicted Christ would return in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nWanting to make a fresh start, Isabella asked God for a new name. \nAgain she had a visionGod renamed her Sojourner \"because I was to \ntravel up an' down the land, showin' the people their sins, an' bein' \na sign unto them.\" She soon asked God for a second name, \"'cause \neverybody else had two names; and the Lord gave me Truth, because I \nwas to declare the truth to the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this new mission, she left New York and traveled throughout New \nEngland, attending local prayer meetings and others she called on her \nown. In 1850 she published her autobiography, written with Olive \nGilbert. It brought her fame, and with that fame came harassment. \nWhen she was once told the building she was to speak in would be \nburned if she preached, she replied, \"Then I will speak to the \nashes.\" Her quick wit and determination were only successful to a \npoint. After being physically assaulted by one particularly vicious \nmob, she was forced to walk with a cane for the rest of her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was against slavery that the former slave made her most virulent \nattacks. But she was also a woman, and once she met other female \nabolitionists, she became an avid supporter of women's rights as \nwell. For many northerners, this was even more controversial than her \nabolitionist preaching. Some tried to stop her from speaking at a \nWomen's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851they feared it \nwould weaken the abolitionist movement. But Truth spoke anyway, \ndelivering her most famous speech:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages \nand lifted over ditches and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody \nhelps me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my \narm. I have plowed, I have planted, and I have gathered into barns. \nAnd no man could head me. And ain't I a woman? I could work as much \nand eat as much as manwhen I could get itand bear the lash as well! \nAnd ain't I a woman? I have borne children and seen most of them sold \ninto slavery, and when I cried out with a mother's grief, none but \nJesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?\u0014\nBy the end of the Civil War, Truth had met with Abraham Lincoln, had \nher arm dislocated by a racist streetcar conductor, petitioned the \ngovernment to make western lands available to freed blacks, and made \ncountless speeches on behalf of African Americans and women. In 1875, \nshe retired to her home in Battle Creek, Michigan, where she remained \nuntil her death in 1883.\u0014",

    "title": "SLAVES WITHOUT MASTERS-- BY IRA BERLIN",
    "words": "In the Antebellum South, there were blacks and there were whites, and \nthere were slaves and there were citizens. That at least was the \ntheory but as Ira Berlin's masterful book demonstrates, the reality \nwas a whole lot more complex than that in at least three main ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe makes a powerful case that the Free Negro of the book's subtitle \nwas an important middle caste in its own right, whose very presence \nwas a contradiction on many levels - the notion of a free black was \nanathema to advocates of the South's peculiar institution, and yet \nthe crucial fact of their being free created a social division \nsufficient to prevent an overriding racial consciousness developing \nand so helped to sustain slavery, especially as many freemen and \n-women were of mixed-race heritage and the upper end - which would \notherwise naturally provide leadership - were well integrated into \nthe 'white' economy, albeit usually as service providers. Some were \neven slaveholders themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin also makes a strong case that while there was clearly a \n'South' as opposed to the North, there were really many Souths and \nthe position of the freeman varied throughout them, from the \ncontrasts between the Upper and Deep South; to those between the \ncities, the settled countryside and the pioneer lands; or of the \nformer French New Orleans as against the former British colonies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThirdly, he makes clear that the freeman's position was not static \nover time but changed markedly from the pre-revolutionary era, \nthrough the brief flourishing of libertarian fervour in the \nRepublic's early years, to the slow erosion of the freeman's position \nthat followed and accelerated in the decade before the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book is incredibly well researched, with hundreds of primary \nsources quoted - most frequently from newspapers or correspondence - \nand those facts marshalled into compelling, interesting and logical \nchapters. These themselves fall into three sections: how the caste \ncame into being, the life of the freeman, and the effects of the \ncrisis of the 1850s on the free black population. Readers should also \nfind the mass of data presented well supports and illustrates the \npoints being made and is often fascinating in its own right.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlaves Without Masters was first published in 1974, when the subject \nof the free negro was far less studied than it is now (Berlin defends \nhis less than politically correct terminology as historically \naccurate: 'free negro' was how they were generally described and \ndescribed themselves). In the second edition, published in 2007, \nBerlin adds a new preface, covering the developments in the study of \nthe subject in the intervening years. However, judging by the \nfootnotes and references, the main text appears largely unaltered.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a book that is essential reading to anyone interested in the \nsociety of the Antebellum South but its value goes well beyond that. \nIt's clear that the mechanisms that whites used to keep the free \nblacks 'in their place' before the Civil War formed the basis of \nSouthern society for the next hundred years after slavery was \nformally abolished and so the book's just as relevant to \nunderstanding the genesis of the pre-Civil Rights South.\u0014",

    "title": "SWISS ANABAPTISTS' SEVEN-POINT CONFESSION",
    "words": "Swiss Anabaptists' Seven-Point Confession\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Reformation, leaders such as Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin \nentered into political arrangements which gave them legitimacy and a \nmeasure of protection. However, the Anabaptists (who called \nthemselves Brethren), taught that church and state should be \nseparate. Membership in church, and the baptism that went with it, \nmust be preceded by a confession of faith and a changed life. The New \nTestament should be the primary guide to life and should interpret \nthe Old, not the other way around. Shortly after Luther's stand led \nto the Reformation, there had arisen a bizarre cult, often also \ncalled Anabaptist, which took the Old Testament as their rule, \nengaged in revolution and seizing the German city of Munster. This \naction brought fury on the pacifist Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Church and Protestants alike killed and harassed the \nharmless Brethren. So severely did the established churches persecute \nthe Anabaptists that their leadership had to be constantly replaced \nas one after another was martyred. In 1527, the Swiss Brethren met \nunder the leadership of Michael Sattler. He drafted them a confession \nof faith now known as the Schleitheim Confession (At the time, it was \ncalled the Brotherly Agreement of Some Children of God). The Brethren \naccepted it without a dissenting vote on this day, February 24, 1527. \nA few months later, Sattler, too, was martyred.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe confession fell under seven points. The first declared that \nBaptism should be given only to those who had learned repentance and \namendment of life, and truly believed that their sins were taken away \nby Christ. The second point instituted the \"ban.\" If a member \npersisted in sin after two private warnings, the congregation would \nexclude and shun that person. The third point said communion would be \nin memory of Christ not as a sacrament. The fourth separated the \nchurch from state. The fifth gave congregations the selection of \ntheir own pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sixth and seventh points were derived from Christ's teaching and \nexample. These were a prohibition on taking up arms and a repudiation \nof oaths. \"...The weapons of their conflict and war are carnal and \nagainst the flesh only, but the Christian's weapons are spiritual, \nagainst the fortification of the devil. The worldlings are armed with \nsteel and iron, but the Christians are armed with the armor of God, \nwith truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation and the Word of \nGod.\" And \"Christ, who teaches the perfection of the Law, prohibits \nall swearing to His (followers), whether true or false -- neither by \nheaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by our head.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, traditional churches viewed these teachings as \nthreatening. Zwingli and Calvin both denounced them. Today, however, \none point or another is accepted by almost every Protestant church or \ndenomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Anabaptists.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

    "title": "SCRIPTURE AND TRADITION IN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH",
    "words": "Scripture and Tradition in the Orthodox Church\u0014\nJames Stamoolis\u0014\n\u0014\nORTHODOXY AS THE TRUE CHURCH\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of being the true Christian church is the dominant theme \nof Eastern Christendom. Orthodoxy is the Church of Christ on earth. \nThere is a strong, even overpowering sense of tradition that envelops \nthe whole body of believers.2 This awareness is a mark that affects \neverything about the church. Panagiotis Bratsiotis asserts that the \nfundamental principle of Orthodoxy is the idea that the Orthodox \nChurch adheres to the principles and piety of early, undivided \nCatholic Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox, the early church was steadfastly \ndevoted to holy tradition and therefore this is an essential \ncharacteristic that must be maintained. We derive our knowledge of \nthe teaching of the Christian Religion from Holy Scripture and Sacred \nTradition, which we therefore call the sources of our Religion. It \nis thus a treasure that must be carefully guarded.\u0014\nThere have been overtures from Protestant Churches to the Easter \nChurch since the Reformation. None has been successful at bringing \nabout union, any more than the attempts at union in the waning \ncenturies of the Bzyantine Empire when the East sought the military \nmight of the West. All have floundered on the exclusivistic claims of \nthe Orthodox Church. At the heart of these claims is the position \nthat the Orthodox Church and only the Orthodox Church has guarded the \ndeposit of divine truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE TWO SOURCES OF REVELATION\u0014\n\u0014\nThe official position of the Orthodox Church is stated very \ndistinctly in several places. The 1962 Almanac of the Greek \nArchdiocese of North and South America contains the following \nstatement:\u0014\n\u0014\nEternal truths are expressed in the Holy Scriptures and the Sacred \nTradition, both of which are equal and are represented pure and \nunadulterated by the true Church established by Christ to continue \nHis mission: mans salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Greek Orthodox Catechism, Divine Revelation is identified as \nthe source from which Christianity draws all its truths.\u0014\nAs, however, those things which God revealed to man were promulgated \neither from mouth to mouth, or by the written word, we say, \ntherefore, that Christianity has two sources: the oral Divine \nRevelation or Holy Tradition, and the written Divine Revelation or \nHoly Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile all revelation comes from God so that one can speak of a single \ndivine source or single Christian tradition, there is still the \nconcept of the two channels in which this revelation reaches the \nchurch. Indeed according to the Orthodox Church, it is imperative to \nthink in terms of these two channels because not everything necessary \nfor salvation can be found in Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nArchbishop Michael clearly expresses this point of view when he \nwrites,  there exist in Tradition elements which, although not \nmentioned in the New Testament as they are in the Church today, are \nindispensable to the salvation of our souls. An example is how \ntradition supplies the words of invocation at the Eucharist. Without \nthese words,  It is impossible to have the sacred mystery of the \nEucharist; but without the mystery  there is no salvation for the \nsoul.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrthodox theologians are in agreement that there is no conflict \nexisting between the two sources. Instead, the two sources are viewed \nas complementary. The whole content of Christian tradition provides \nthe dogmatic base for the church. The Bible is part of this \noverarching tradition. The several components of the tradition are \nalso expressions of the source of ultimate authority, the Triune God.\u0014\nThe content of the tradition is found in the decisions of the Seven \nEcumenical Councils, certain local or regional councils, the \nstatements of individual bishops, the Fathers, the Liturgy, canon law \nand icons. Of the above, the Ecumenical Councils have irrevocable \nauthority. However the process of acceptance of a council as \necumenical was by no means automatic. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Nicaea (325) was not recognized for more than fifty \nyears, but it later became the symbol of what an ecumenical council \nwas to be. The Council of Ephesus (449), which was declared to be \necumenical, was later repudiated. How does one determine which \ncouncils are ecumenical? The final judge of a council is the Holy \nSpirit. This is because any council which truly represents the church \nand is gathered together in the name of Christ will certainly be \ninspired by the Holy, Spirit and will therefore be infallible. The \nSpirit expresses himself through the church. Thus we can speak of the \nchurch recognizing this or that council to be ecumenical. The period \nof the Ecumenical Councils has great significance for Orthodoxy. It \nis regarded as a normative period because not only were the great \ndogmatical forms determined, but also the basis of the canon law was \nlaid down.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE ROLE OF TRADITION AS THE INTERPRETER OF HOLY SCRIPTURE\u0014\n\u0014\nEastern Orthodoxy considers the Bible to be the possession of the \nchurch. Therefore it follows that the church, not the Bible, has \nfinal authority. The Bible is only one aspect of the deposit of \ndivine revelation given to the church. As the guardian of this divine \nrevelation, the church has the sole right and obligation to interpret \nand convey the message of the Bible. The Church alone can interpret \nHoly Scripture with authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has always been admitted that there are portions of the Scriptures \nthat are unclear. Within the Bible itself, a warning is given against \nthose who would use the sacred text for their own ends. However, it \nappears that the churchs right of interpretation covers not only \nwhat might be considered obscure passages, but covers the whole text. \nOrthodox, when they read the Scripture, accept the guidance of the \nChurch.14 Ware cites as his authority the Confession of Dositheus. \nThis seventeenth century document arose out of the conflict between \ntraditional Orthodoxy and the Calvinistic party of Cyril Lucar. It \nis admitted by Orthodox theologians that the reaction to Calvinism \nborrowed from Roman Catholic sources. And while Dositheus is regarded \nas being Orthodox in spirit, he did employ Latin terminology in his \nConfession. Ware refers to Article II in the Confession of Dositheus \nwhich is in essential agreement with the Tridentine degree. Phillip \nSchaff gives the following summary of the article:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Holy Scriptures must be interpreted, not by private judgment but \nin accordance with the tradition of the Catholic Church, which can \nnot err, or deceive, or be deceived, and is of equal authority with \nthe Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be remembered that this confession was a point by point \nrefutation of the confession of faith circulated under the name of \nCyril Lucar. Article II of Lucars confession maintained that the \nauthority of the Scriptures is superior to that of the church. In his \nsecond edition, the perpicuity of Scriptures in matters of faith is \ndeclared.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo things should be clear. The first is that the Orthodox Church \nclearly rejected the Reformation position of the authority of the \nScriptures. The overwhelming sentiment against such views is \nindicated by the three-fold anathema pronounced by the Synod of \nJerusalem (1762) against the heretical Calvinistic doctrines.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second point to note is that the Confession of Dositheus holds to \na two source theory. Both Scripture and tradition are necessary for a \ncorrect understanding of the Orthodox faith. The problem is what is \nthe relationship between them. How does tradition serve as an \ninterpreter of the Scripture? To answer this question, we must look \nat the hermeneutical principles used by the Orthodox Church. It is an \nexceedingly difficult area to investigate but there are some \nimportant distinctions made by Orthodox scholars. Writing in The \nGreek Orthodox Theological Review, Nikos Nissiotis attempts to offer \naid in the area of the prolegoma to hermeneutics. He outlines several \nkey principles that the Orthodox believer must take into account \nbefore entering the complexities of the hermeneutical problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nNissiotis deals with the key issue of authority. His conclusion is \nthat the authority belongs to the church, but that this authority \nrelies on the believing community, both clergy and laity. What \nsignificance does this have for exegisis? This presents an entirely \ndifferent question from the question faced by the West, in both the \nRoman Catholic and the Protestant churches. The discussion about \nauthority or the guarantee of right biblical exegesis is foreign to \nthe Orthodox Church. The conception of exegesis is totally different. \nNissiotis attempts to express the Orthodox hermeneutical principles \nregarding authority in the following way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Orthodox regard exegeses as an offering of the whole community, \nas the voice of the Church in a given situation, a reinterpretation \nwhich helps the believers struggling in this world and for this world \nto readapt the message of the Gospel to a new situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is really the key to the Orthodox Churchs concept of the unity \nof tradition and Scripture. Everything revolves around the concept of \nthe church as a whole being the guardian of truth. Therefore the \nother principles that must be believed before the problem of \nhermeneutics is discussed all revolve around the church. For example, \nNissiotis does not want hermeneutics left as the exclusive domain of \nNew Testament scholars and exegetes. He feels that the specialist is \nmore concerned with the methodological problem and does not pay \nattention to the other uses of the Bible, if only for their \ndevotional or liturgical life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus everything is arranged around the ecclesiological presupposition \nwhich views the church as the ultimate authority on earth. \nFurthermore, the church is the central focus of all Christian work. \nAll the gifts of the Spirit were given to enable her to be \nstrengthened. However, the prophetic charisma was not exercised by \nPaul on the question of receiving Gentiles into the Church until he \nhad received the unanimous support of the Church in Jerusalem (Ac. \n15:22). Nissiotis sees this approach to be a key principle in \nhermenutics. This phrase Then it seemed good to the apostles and \nelders, with the whole church, must be the basis for all efforts to \nbuild up the Christian community and interpret the Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe needs of the witnessing communtiy are met by the application and \ninterpretation of Scripture. The task is undertaken for the purpose \nof meeting these needs and the church as a whole is responsible for \nthis task.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuidelines can be drawn according to this ecclesiological principle \nwhen there are apparent contradictions between the biblical authors. \nThe problem of interpreting the whole of revelation is for the \nOrthodox not a problem of systematizing the various scriptural \npassages. In fact nothing could be farther from the spirit of \nOrthodoxy. The Bible is not regarded as giving a blueprint for \norganization or a systematic exposition of moral teaching or dogmatic \ntheology. The Bible is the book of life of the Ecclesia, it does not \ndictate to it rules of behaviour and canon laws. Rather the Bible is \nthe revelation of God in history, dealing more with the acts of God \nand the Christian community. This should not be construed to mean \nthat the Orthodox are not concerned with the revelation of \nprepositional truth, for they most certainly are. It only means that \nwith reference to the Bible, there is no systematic presentation of \nthis truth.22\u0014\nThe lack of a systematic framework in the Bible is balanced by the \nunity that is established with tradition. Since the Spirit that \ninspired the Bible also inspires the church in its tradition, any \nlogical contradictions or apparent deficiencies are eliminated. This \nview follows logically from the Othodox Churchs position on the \nBible. Therefore, tradition and Scripture are a team, both working \ntogether for the salvation of humankind, both vital parts of the \nChristian community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe appeal to tradition as an interpreter of Scripture apparently \narose out of the needs of the early church. In the controversies with \nvarious heretics, those who were orthodox, i.e. those who held the \ntraditional view, needed some source to reinforce their \ninterpretation of the Scripture. An appeal to the Bible seemed to be \ninsufficient because the heretics cited scriptural passages to \nsupport their positions. For example, the Arians claimed their view \nwas biblical. But one can go back even earlier for the problem did \nnot arise for the first time in the fourth century. In the second \ncentury Gnostics, Sabellians and Montonists also appealed to the \nBible. Who was to decide the issue? What were the principles of \ninterpretation?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in this historical situation that the authority of Tradition \nwas first invoked. Scripture belonged to the Church, and it was only \nin the Church, within the community of right faith, that Scripture \ncould be adequately understood and correctly interpreted. Heretics, \nthat is those outside of the Church, had no key to the mind of the \nScripture. It was not enough just to read and to quote scriptural \nwordsthe true meaning or intent, of scripture, taken as an \nintegrated whole, had to be elicited.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the church which has the true meaning of Scripture alone could \ninterpret the Scripture. This meaning was contained in the apostolic \ntradition which the church preserved. Florovsky points out that for \nthe Fathers, Scripture and tradition were always connected. Without \nthe correct rule of interpretation, the Bible was merely words; \ntradition supplies the key to interpretation.\u0014\nWith tradition playing such a vital role in the understanding of the \nfaith, it is obvious that the bearer of tradition is charged with an \nexceedingly important role. The church is therefore central in the \ntask of exegesis. However, the early Fathers, for example, \nTertullian, did not claim authority for the church. As Florovsky \nexpresses it:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Church was not an external authority, which had to judge over the \nScripture, but rather the keeper and guardian of that Divine Truth \nwhich was stored and deposited in Holy Writ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt can be seen that quite early in the history of the church the \nquestion of tradition came up. The appeal to the continuity with the \napostolic faith is understandable. It is always the appeal of those \nwishing to underscore their link with the past. There is little \nproblem in applying this principle when one of the opposing parties \nclaims a new revelation. The problem becomes more difficult when both \nsides appeal to the ancient tradition and both claim to be the lineal \ndescendants of the earlier custodians of the faith. For this reason, \nboth Protestants and the Roman Catholics attempted to discover in the \nEastern Orthodox Church elements that would support their respective \npositions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe replies of Jeremiah II to the Lutheran Reformers (157381) have \ntaken on a confession or dogmatic significance in the Orthodox \nChurch. Jeremiah II was the first official Orthodox response to the \nReformation. Jeremiah II calls on the Lutherans to return to the true \nfaith as found in the Orthodox Church. He broke off the \ncorrespondence when the Lutherans persisted in seeking his \nrecognition of the validity of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Reformers, from the Othodox point of view, were correct in \nappealing to the Orthodox Church. From the Orthodox point of view \nthey, unlike the Western Church, preserved the true tradition. The \nchurch would have ceased to have been the church if she had departed \nfrom the holy tradition. It is the very historical continuity with \nthe early church that marks Orthodoxy as the true faith.\u0014\nThe result of the Orthodox Churchs stand is to weld the Scripture to \nthe tradition preserved in the church. One can speak of tradition \nstanding over the Scripture, because the meaning of Scripture can be \nunlocked only by the key of tradition. Therefore, the hermeneutical \nbond between the two sources of faith, Scripture and tradition, in \neffect produces the single source that modern Orthodox theologians \nare so fond of speaking of as Christian tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nTRADITION: THE TESTS OF AUTHENTICITY\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat constitutes authentic tradition? There are some criteria which \nthe church used in determining the dogmatic symbols. For the most \npart, the criteria reflect the general acceptance of the symbol by a \nsignificant section of the church or its production by a recognized \nheirarch. But it must always be remembered that these doctrinal \nstatements while new are held by the Orthodox to be only \nexplications of what had already been held.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore there are not what might be called new doctrines \nexpressed in the church. The central tenets, for example, those \ndefined by Ecumenical Councils must be adhered to by all Orthodox. \nThis is not because Ecumenical Councils are the supreme authority, \nbut because the decrees of Ecumenical Councils have been recognized \nand witnessed by the whole church. It is precisely this universal \nrecognition that makes a council ecumenical. As Bratsiotis expresses \nit:  the decisive criterion of an Ecumenical Council is the \nrecognition of its decrees by the whole Church, which is therefore in \nfact the sole authority in Orthodoxy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the only authority, the church does have the role of deciding what \nis authentic tradition. Two facts must be noted at this point. The \nfirst is that there can be legitimate local tradition that does not \nhave universal authority. In other words, national churches have the \nright to maintain certain practices that differ from other Orthodox \nChurches. The unity of the Orthodox Christians is not a unity of \nlanguage, liturgical rite or baptismal creed. Rather the unity is a \nunity of faith which the national churches express in their own \nlanguages and rites. This is a freedom that the East rejoices in and \nis considered to be a fundamental characteristic of Orthodoxy.\u0014\nStrict conformity in matters of liturgical practices has never been \nconsidered to be a real obstacle to the reunion of the East and West. \nMeyendorff cites several important thinkers such as Photius, \nPatriarch of Constantinople (858886), and Peter, Patriarch of \nAntioch (105256), who considered local practices, even those defined \nby local conciliar decrees, as matters of indifference. These \npractices in no way affected the unity of the faith. The main problem \ndividing East and West was seen in the doctrinal question of the \nprocession of the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the central faith there remains room for the local practice to \nshine through, creating what might be considered a unique and \nexpressive worship experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second point to note is that there seem to be two tests to \ndetermine authentic tradition. The two are 1) apostolicity: the \ndoctrine comes from the apostles who in turn received it directly \nfrom the Lord, and 2) the concept of the universal acceptance on the \npart of the church, that is, decisions considered to be ecumenical \nbecause of recognition by the whole church. It is incorrect to view \nthese doctrines as opposed to each other because no Orthodox \ntheologian does so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn illustration of the concept of apostolicity is found in an article \nby Archbishop Michael in which he refers to the tradition received \nfrom the apostles orally. This same tradition was handed on from \ngeneration to generation until it was embodied and codified in the \nworks of the major Fathers of the Church and in the resolutions of \nthe seven Ecumenical Councils and the ten local Synods of the \nChurch. There is no thought here of enlarging or changing the \ndeposit of tradition. The Archbishop speaks against those who ignore \nor repudiate tradition (i.e. Protestants) and those who enlarge and \nadd to tradition (i.e. Roman Catholics). Orthodoxy is seen to hold a \nmiddle-of-the-road-policy by neither adding to or subtracting from \nthe apostolic tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sentiment expressed by Archbishop Michael is common in the \nOrthodox Church which is by self definition the church of tradition. \nHowever, there is another test of the authenticity of tradition that \ncan be employed but has not been used in recent history. This is the \ntest of universal acceptance by the church. As has been shown above, \nthis does not mean conformity in practice or liturgical rite, but in \nmatters of faith.33 The concept of universal recognition and \nacceptance by the church determines which councils are recognized by \nthe Orthodox as ecumenical.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the concept of universal acceptance as a test of tradition, it \nseems cleat that the interpretation of the Faith of the church rests \nwith the church as a whole. Indeed, this is the Orthodox position. \nThe whole church is the guardian of orthodoxy, not just the \nhierarchy. However, it has been the normal practice for the laity to \ndelegate this authority, knowingly or unknowingly, to the hierarchy. \nThe bishop is the representative of Christ in the Eucharistic \ngathering and is the symbol of the authority of the church. There is \nboth a blessing and a problem in the delegation of the authority of \nthe believers to the ecclesiastical leadership. The blessing is the \nhistorical continuity of the traditions and customs. The problem is \nthat the life of the Holy Spirit who indwells all believers is not \nfree to express the full dimensions of the Christian life. Form \nrather than personal experience inside the form comes to dominate the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps this is the central problem of tradition. It both preserves \nthe past experiences and understandings of the people of God and does \nhamper the ongoing work of the Spirit in the believing community. The \nwork of the Spirit in both preservation and freedom of expression \nmust be kept in creative tension so that the voice of God in todays \nsituation can be heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the interpretation of the faith can and must move beyond the \nelements that have been handed down, because the church herself is a \nliving body. The Orthodox Church has suffered a decline in attendance \n(but not necessarily membership) in a country like Greece because the \nchurch is not perceived to be relevant to the secularized society. \nThe church is respected as a preserver of culture and for the witness \nof the church to the oppressors in the past, but is not thought to be \nrelevant to today. It will be interesting to see if the same \nphenomena occurs in the former Soviet Union. The challenge is for the \nchurch to keep the Faith once delivered and make it speak to todays \nworld. Some Orthodox maintain that the Byzantine liturgies are \ntimeless and neither can nor should be changed. Other Orthodox speak \nof the need for liturgical reform to make the services more \nacceptable in terms of length.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some interest among the Orthodox in sorting out true \ntradition from what might be called human traditions. A hierarchy of \ntradition exists in the Orthodox Church. It is recognized that not \neverything from the past is of equal value. The elements that have \nunique authority are the Bible, the Creed, and the doctrinal \ndefinitions of the Ecumenical Councils. The decrees of the Synod of \nJassy (which ratified the Confession of Peter Moghila) and of the \nSynod of Jerusalem (which ratified the Confession of Dositheus) are \nnot considered to be on the same level with the earlier statements. \nThis is not because they are later and thus past the age of the \nFathers, but because at the time they were composed Orthodoxy was in \nan uneven struggle with the West. Some theologians blame the problem \non Moslem conquest and interference. It was not Orthodoxy at her best \nwhich met the challenges of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. \nThis frank admission of foreign elements in the seventeenth century \ndoctrinal statements may provide an opportunity for dialogue with \nEvangelicals. However, it should be realized that while the \nformulations of the seventeenth century are not in the fullest spirit \nof the Eastern Church, the Orthodox nevertheless attribute to them \nconfessional status.38\u0014\n\u0014\nHer role as the true church and guardian of tradition lays upon \nEastern Orthodoxy the duty to examine what has been handed down. \nAntiquity is not to be confused with truth. Not everything received \nfrom the past is to be accepted. One of the bishops at the Council of \nCarthage (257) reminded his fellows that The Lord said, I am truth. \nHe did not say, I am custom. Human opinions or mere custom must be \nseparated from the authentic deposit of tradition. To do this means \nthat the past must be critically reexamined. There is a growing \nawareness of the need for historical studies by Orthodox \ntheologians.40\u0014\n\u0014\nCAN THE DEPOSIT OF TRUTH CHANGE?\u0014\n\u0014\nCan tradition ever be modified? The answer is yes and no. Dealing \nwith the no first, it is the position of the Orthodox Church that \nthey have preserved the faith handed down. They believe that they \nhave not tampered with the sacred deposit, having neither added \nanything, nor subtracted anything. Therefore, it is obvious that \nhaving preserved the true faith for nearly 2000 years, they will \nhardly consider tampering with it now.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet while there is, to say the least, a definite ring of finality in \nthe above statements, it is also possible to answer the question in \nthe affirmative. Petrified mummy is a term of opprobrium that has \nbeen hurled at the Eastern Orthodox Church by Western theologians. \nHowever, the Orthodox do not regard their position to be static and \nunmoving in any way. To consider the Eastern Churches as lifeless and \ndead is to miss the wonder of Orthodoxy. There is a remarkable blend \nof unchanging authority and present experience. As Bratsiotis \nexpresses it:\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if Holy Tradition is accepted as a source of faith, its \nimmutability must be recognized as immutable. Moreover, in the \nOrthodox Church tradition is not regarded as a static factoras many \nnon-Orthodox people thinkbut as a dynamic one. Loyalty to tradition \ndoes not simply mean slavish attachment to the past and to external \nauthority, but a living connection with the entire past experience of \nthe Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Bratsiotis, the reasons for the Orthodox Church \nappearing to be static are purely historical, not organic. In light \nof the three centuries of Frankish and Venetian rule and four \ncenturies of Moslem domination, not to mention the more recent \nBolshevik tyranny, the fact that the church still exists is somewhat \nmiraculous. It is these historical reasons that account for a lack of \ntheological advance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut turning away from the problem of the past, can we discover \nanything within tradition that will unlock the door and give meaning \nto the expression, a living connection with the past? Precisely how \nis this past experience relevant to our present situation? What is \nthe link that joins the Orthodox Church of this day and age to the \nchurch of the Ecumenical Councils? The gap is bridged because the \nchurch, Christs church, remains indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The \npresence of the Spirit thus signifies the true bond that unites the \nchurch to her past.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is here more than just an unbroken historic continuity, which \nis indeed quite obvious. There is above all an ultimate spiritual and \nontological identity, the same faith, the same spirit, the same \nethos. And this constitutes the distinctive mark of Orthodox.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is on this basis that one must understand tradition and indeed, \nthe role of tradition in the church. Tradition is not something \nexternal that one investigates from the outside. Rather Tradition is \nfar more than a set of abstract propositions; it is a life, a \npersonal encounter with Christ in the Holy Spirit. Considering the \ncharacteristics of a personal encounter, one would expect a dynamic \nexperience, an interaction between two living persons. In terms of \nthis encounter tradition can thus be thought of as a living, growing \nrelationship. Therefore, while the main body of truth does not \nchange, the outward forms can change to conform to the new situations \nin which the church finds herself. It is incorrect to speak of \ndoctrinal stagnation in the Orthodox Church. Such a concept is not in \nkeeping with the nature of the Georges Florovsky and Vladimir Lossky, \nconsiders new doctrinal formulation a distinct possibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nTradition, while inwardly changeless (for God does not change), is \nconstantly assuming new forms, which supplement the old without \nsuperseding them. Orthodox often speak as if the period of doctrinal \nformulation were wholly at an end, yet this is not the case. Perhaps \nin our own day new Ecumenical Councils will meet, and tradition will \nbe enriched by new statements of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere we return to the concept of the consensus of the church as the \ndeterminer of tradition. In Wares statement we see the two answers, \nthe noTradition does not changeand the yesthe church is able to \nenrich the deposit of Faith. This promise of openness can form the \nbasis of inquiry into an exchange between the East and the West. The \ndoor is not closed for discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nTradition plays a central role in the Orthodox East. But the very \ntradition that separates East and West may be found to be the bridge \nwhich will unite those who are called Christians. Perhaps there is a \nnew role for tradition in this generation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. James Stamoolis is Dean of Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illino\u0014",

    "words": "Spanish Armada Sailed to its Doom\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, May 28, 1588, Medina Sidonia's flagship, the San Martin \nled the greatest fleet ever assembled up to that time, out of the \nLisbon River to sea. They were bound for England. Philip, King of \nSpain, had had enough of the pesky English, who pretended to be at \npeace with him while waging war. Above all, the Spanish loathed Sir \nFrancis Drake, who harried and harassed them at sea and along their \ncoasts in Europe and Latin America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were religious reasons for the attempted invasion, too. Spain \nwas Catholic, England Protestant. Nothing would please the Spanish \nempire more than to return the island nation to the Roman fold. Its \npolicy had been aimed at this for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nAboard the 130 newly-outfitted ships of the Armada were 19,000 \nsoldiers, ready to invade and conquer England. But from the start, \nthe Spanish fleet experienced difficulties. Its ships met bad \nweather. Getting so many ships with unequal abilities into formation \nproved difficult. Furthermore, Drake's bold attack on Cadiz in 1587 \nhad delayed the invasion a year. More importantly, Drake had burned \nvast quantities of wood and hoops intended to make barrels. As a \nresult of this and of having eaten its freshest supplies over winter, \nthe Armada found itself with spoiled rations. Plague began. The ships \nhad to regroup at Finnisterre and deal with these problems. It cost \nthem a month's delay.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrake wanted to attack the Spanish in their own waters. Elizabeth \nsaid no. She did not want to commit her nation to war. Drake brought \nthe fleet into Portsmouth harbor. The wind turning, it was almost \ntrapped there. But the English captains quickly \"warped\" out (hauled \ntheir ships around on anchors). Sailing under Philip's inflexible \norders, the Spanish missed a golden opportunity to seriously maul the \nEnglish fleet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English strategy proved flawed when they harassed the Spanish \nfrom a distance: shells from the long range guns to which they had \ncommitted their fleet could not penetrate the Spanish hulls. The \nSpanish formation, briefly impaired by storms, remained substantially \nintact and arrived in the straits of Dover, on August 6th, more than \ntwo months after setting sail.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English launched fireboats against the Spanish, who panicked and \nbroke formation trying to get free. The Armada, harassed by the \nEnglish and Dutch, put up a fight, but when its shot ran out, the \nEnglish sailed in close and began pounding the big ships to pieces. \nAttempting to stick together, the Armada sailed in the only direction \nit could go: north. The sailors attempted to take their ships around \nScotland and back down the Atlantic past Ireland home. At least 51 \nships perished and thousands of men.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defeat of the Armada helped preserve the Reformation. Philip, \nwhen he heard of the magnitude of the disaster wrote, \"I hope that \nGod has not permitted so much evil for everything has been done in \nhis service.\" But Protestants issued gloating letters, pamphlets and \nmedals. \"God breathed and they were scattered,\" said one of \nElizabeth's medals.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Armada.\" Encyclopedia Britannica.

    "words": "Whenever the church gets in bed with politics, the church gets \npregnant. And our offspring does not look like our Father in Heaven. \n J.D. Greear, Southern Baptist Convention President, June 15, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nOutgoing president of the Southern Baptist Convention J. D. Greear \nincluded this quip in his final presidential address yesterday at the \nconventions Annual Meeting in Nashville, TN.\u0014\n\u0014\nJILL HICKS-KEETON  JUNE 16, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, notice that God, portrayed as male, has sexual access to \nwomens bodies for his own purposes whether grandly benevolent (Luke \n2; John 3:16) or just plain vindictive (Revelation 2). The church, \nfurther, is cast as a woman who owes her bodily fidelity to this \ndemanding male deity whose patrilineality must be protected from her \nwaywardness. Her womb is his property. Her purity is his domain. Her \nbody is his to discipline. The perceived threat is not to the womans \nravished body but to the patriarchal order.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ. D.Greears particular formulation of the trope is tied to \nevangelical purity culture. Note that his turn of phrase is deeply \nuneven in its gendered assignation of blame and enculturation of \nfear. The language of so-and-so gets pregnant is a linguistic \nconstruction that can only have the impregnated woman, the assumed \noffender, as the subject. It obscures the involvement of any \ninseminating sexual partner. She is the one who is caught. She is the \none who should be afraid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe chances that Greear intended to scare women are next to none. \nRather, the metaphor of church as promiscuous woman was likely meant \nas a good faith effort to shock listeners to consider the larger \npoint about evangelism versus politics. It was done for rhetorical \neffect. Yetand this is extremely importantthe only people in the \naudience for whom this metaphor could be rhetorically effective \nwithout also engendering fear are men. Weems writes in an analogous \nway of the assumed audience of the Bibles prophets: \u0014\n\u0014\nOnly an audience that had never been raped or had never perceived \nrape or sexual abuse as a real threat could be expected to hear the \nkinds of ribald descriptions of abused women, sexual humiliation, \nassault, gang rape, violation, and torture that the prophets \ndescribed and not recoil in fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same is true for the Southern Baptist preacher in 2021.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreears rhetoric, incidental though it may have been, disciplines \nwomen to see themselves as belonging to men, to internalize male \nauthority in destructive ways. The metaphor encourages men to align \nwith the deity who has the power to control and punish. It is not, I \nsubmit, an effective way to confront sexual abuse in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is biblical, though. And herein lies an important point. In the \nsame address, Greear affirmed his commitment to the Bible: I am \ncommitted to letting the Scripture, and the Scripture alone, be our \nrule for faith and practice. Anything else is unnecessarily \ndivisive. In a recent review piece for RD, I wondered aloud whether \nevangelical Christianity might be irredeemably patriarchal precisely \nbecause of its biblicism. Patriarchy and the Bible, it seems, are \nnatural bedfellows.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the attention on newly elected SBC president Litton as a \nmoderate, his leadership is unlikely to change the SBCs linking of \nsexism and biblicism. In a statement given to the fundamentalist \nCouncil on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood leading up to the high \nprofile election, Litton wrote: \u0014\n\u0014\nTo us as Southern Baptists, our convictions about the Bible are tied \nto our understanding of gender and the roles of men and women in the \nchurch. So, in the conservative resurgence we addressed the doctrine \nof inerrancy, and because the Bible is Gods Word, it is perfect and \nauthoritative. That means we should take the passages on gender to \nmean what they say, and His Word should always occupy our attention.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAn observation of retiring president, J.D.Gree,SBC June, 2021\u0014",

Occom had \nbeen a notable evangelist among American Indians, a hymnwriter, and \nthe principal fundraiser for the college which became Dartmouth \nUniversity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in a wigwam on Mohegan land, Samson Occom (1723-1792) was one of \nthe first ordained Christian Indian ministers. Occom's popularity as \nan eloquent teacher and spiritual leader grew with Indians over a \nlarge part of New England.

    "title": "SHOULD MANUSCRIPT DIFFERENCES SCARE CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "Should the Differences in Biblical Manuscripts Scare Christians? \u0014\n22 Jul 2021   \u0014\nBy Randy Leedy, PhD\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians are troubled by textual variants, or the differences \nin biblical manuscripts. The Bible has scribal errors in it? Then how \ncan I be sure what Im reading is Gods word?\u0014\n\u0014\nI have taught New Testament Introduction to beginning seminary \nstudents for many years, and Ive come to realize that theres a \nsimple path to clarity and comfort regarding this issuesimpler than \ndiving into excessively complicated details about ancient manuscripts \nwritten in languages few Christians have the training or experience \nto assess reliably.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are three reasons Christians should not be troubled by \ndifferences in biblical manuscripts.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. No theologies or denominations claim a particular text\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, there are differences between Bible manuscripts, and from a \ncertain perspective, they can look alarmingly serious. For example, \nthose manuscripts (and resultant Bible translations) which omit 1 \nJohn 5:7 seem to some readers to undermine the doctrine of the \nTrinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut theres a simple way to demonstrate how trivial the differences \nbetween ancient manuscripts really are in terms of their effect on \nthe body of truth that the Bible reveals. We have lots of doctrinal \ndifferences within Christianity, right? But there are no Calvinist \nmanuscripts/versions, Arminian manuscripts/versions, Pentecostal, \nReformed, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Congregationalist, Egalitarian, \nComplementarian, Integrationist, Cessationist, or Continuationist \nmanuscripts/versions.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake any systematic theology textbook you want, and the set of proof \ntexts offered for particular points is for all practical purposes \nversion-independentthe authors dont care which translation you use, \nso they just give references. The difference in doctrinal character \namong the various manuscripts and translations is very close to zero. \nThe omission of 1 John 5:7 (in the judgment of almost all textual \nscholars, those words were actually added very late in the manuscript \ntradition, not appearing in Erasmus Greek New Testament until its \nthird edition) has not caused a single Christian denomination to \ndescend into Unitarianismbecause the New Testament elsewhere still \nclearly teaches the doctrine of the Trinity. In fact, none of the \nGreek writings of the early church ever mentions this passageeven in \ntheir discussions of the Trinity! If the church fathers recognized \nand formulated that vital doctrine without referring to this verse, \nthen its presence in the New Testament of their day is highly \nunlikely, and certainly its absence from a Bible text or translation \ntoday constitutes no defect in doctrinal character.\u0014\n \u0014\nIf the differences between Greek texts were doctrinally significant, \nyou would expect theologies and tribal groups to grow out of \ndistinctive readings of those textsyou would expect certain sects to \nadopt Greek texts as theological banners. But compare the positions \nof Majority text advocates, Textus Receptus devotees, and eclectic \ntext users on the core doctrines of the historic creeds and youd be \nhard pressed to find a doctrinal difference for which they claim \nsupport in their favored New Testament text as opposed to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nDifferent Christian tribes bring somewhat different lenses to the \nBible, but its the lenses that differ, not the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Even if we had absolutely perfect copies, the work of \ninterpretation would still have to go on\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we had the originals themselvesthe very pieces of papyrus Paul \nused to compose Romans and Ephesians, for exampleor if no copies \ncontained any textual variants at all, unlocking the Bibles power \nwould still require us to do exactly what we do now: search for \nScriptures wisdom as for hidden treasure, interpreting carefully, \ncomparing Scripture with Scripture, and making relevant personal \napplication. Nothing would change except that we would be able to \ndismiss from our minds the possibility that the text were working \nwith may not preserve Gods exact inspired words with complete \nperfection. But my own weaknesses as a reader expose me to far more \nsignificant misunderstanding than the differences in biblical \nmanuscripts do, so by far the greatest problems that God must \novercome in order to talk to me are within me, not within the \ntransmission process.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Pristine perfection is a property of the next world, not \n(generally) of this one\u0014\n\u0014\nIts true that the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts we have cant all \npreserve the exact wording of the originals (and by definition, a \ntranslation cannot do so). The fact that no two manuscripts are \nidentical down to the jots and tittles means that at most only one \nmanuscript of any given Bible book can be perfect. All manuscripts \nof any size (some are less than a page) contain some obvious scribal \nslips, so it seems clear that God hasnt given us access to the one \nperfect manuscript of any book of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe very strong pattern God has ordained is that pristine perfection \nis a property of the next world, not this one, so I just need to \nconform my expectations to that reality. The textual imperfections \nthat generate so much angst and controversy are well within an easily \ntolerable range, and, while of course we must make the wisest choices \nwe can, we can be completely at ease that, with the exception of \nextreme paraphrases or Bibles translated by cult groups, any Bible we \nmay use is fully trustworthy as Gods Word. We need not fear that \nsome of these Bibles are the devils. Where does Scripture warn us to \nferret out and avoid the devils Bibles? It seems that, in his \nsovereignty, God has arranged that the very few Bibles possibly \nworthy of that categorization are obviously so, not subtly so.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo should we be concerned about the differences in biblical \nmanuscripts?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the manuscripts were hopelessly confused across their whole bodies \nof text about whether Pauls gospel was justification by faith plus \nworks of the law or justification by faith without works of the law; \nor if some manuscripts said that the baptism of the Spirit includes \nspeaking with tongues and some said the opposite; or if some promised \nthat Jesus would rapture his church before the Tribulation while \nothers took what we now call a postmillennial viewthen identifying \nthe correct text would obviously be a matter of theological \nimportance. Jesus called some matters of the law weightier than \nothers (Matt 23:23)if serious differences in biblical manuscripts \nexisted among those, wed have a serious difficulty.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the variations we have among manuscripts raise far different \nquestions: does the inspired text say we have redemption through \nChrists blood twice or only once? Does it testify to Jesus atoning \nblood 44 times or only 43? Does John say his anointing or the same \nanointing (one letter different in Greek) in 1 John 2:27.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the two major passages that are textually questionableMark \n16:9-20 and John 7:538:11do not affect the doctrinal character of \nthe New Testament. The former largely duplicates material found in \nthe other gospels; the latter illustrates truths we know well from \nother passages: the scribes and Pharisees are self-righteous and \nJesus is forgiving and yet demanding. If such differences in biblical \nmanuscripts represent Satans best attempt to corrupt the doctrinal \ncharacter of Scripture, then God is clearly keeping him on a very \nshort leash, indeed. Oh, for a life full to the brim of such problems \nas these!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bottom line is that God has arranged things so that I can take \nany good English Bible translation, based on any textual or \ntranslation philosophy, treat it as if its every English word were \nstraight from him, and get everything I need from that Bible to know, \nlove, and live for him in a way that will bring Christs Well done! \nwhen I stand before him. And what more is there to life?\u0014\nWherever a problem in transmission or in my own reading may tend to \nlead me astray, theres a corrective somewhere else in Scripture \nthat, when I interpret the parts in light of the whole, will keep me \nwithin bounds.\u0014",

This post references it a good deal, and anyone interested in \nspiritual warfare should check it out, too.\u0014\n \u0014\n1. Satan means adversary.\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan is a transliteration of a Hebrew word, which means \nadversary, or opponent. The word satan is used multiple times in \nthe Old Testament, often referring to anyone who is blocking or \nchallenging someone else. For example:\u0014\n\tThe angel of the Lord opposes Balaam (Numbers 21:2232).\u0014\n\tTwo of Davids bloodthirsty warriors, Joab and Abishai, make life \ndifficult for the king (2 Samuel 19:22).\u0014\n\tSolomon faces political opponents after he turns from God (1 Kings \n11:1425).\u0014\nIn each of these episodes, the Hebrew Bible calls these figures \nsatan, because they are acting as adversaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how did the devil get the name Satan?\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries between Malachi and Jesus, Jewish writers began to \nuse this label as a name for the biggest adversary of them all: a \ndivine being who rebelled against God in the Garden of Eden by \ntempting Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn The Unseen Realm, Dr. Michael S. Heiser says, The dark figure of \nGenesis 3 was eventually thought of as the mother of all \nadversaries, and so the label satan got stuck to him. He deserves \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Pride fueled the devils origin story.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the last place youd look to find information about Satan is \nin a list of pastoral qualities. And yet, as the apostle Paul lays \nout the qualities he expects of church leaders, he makes specific \nmention of the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle warns Timothy that any elder must not be a recent \nconvert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment \nas the devil (1 Timothy 3:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible doesnt give us a great deal of specifics when it comes to \nSatans rebellion against God. But in the passages that do seem to \ntouch on the devils fall from grace, pride is a predominant theme.\u0014\n\u0014\nClue: Ezekiels oracle against the prince of Tyre\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Old Testament, the prophet Ezekiel takes up an oracle against \nthe human ruler of Tyre, an arrogant person smug enough to claim to \nbe a god himself (28:2). God plans to bring this prince down a notch.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut while Ezekiel preaches against this ruler, he seems to make \nseveral allusions to a similar story on a cosmic scale. In fact, the \nprophet says a few things that point all the way back to the Garden \nof Eden:\u0014\n\u0014\nYou were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in \nbeauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God [] you were anointed as \na guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount \nof God; you walked among the fiery stones (28:1214).\u0014\n\u0014\nLater in the oracle, Ezekiel tells us that this being had a pride \nproblem similar to the prince of Tyres: Your heart became proud on \naccount of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your \nsplendor (28:17).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis being is punished: hes expelled from Eden to a new domain: \nearth and the underworld.\u0014\nClue: Isaiahs parable against the king of Babylon\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophet Isaiah compares the arrogant king of Babylon to a \nparticularly ambitious divine being who has fallen from heaven \n(Isaiah 14:12).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis character at one point said to himself: I will ascend to the \nheavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit \nenthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount \nZaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make \nmyself like the Most High (14:1314).\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser notes that this passage reads like an attempted coup in the \ndivine council. [] He wanted to be like the Most High (elyon). But \nthere can be only one of those.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Satans domain is earth and Sheol.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the third chapter of Genesis, the serpent persuades Adam and Eve \nto eat the forbidden fruit, expelling them from Eden and sealing \ntheir doom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut although Adam and Eve are punished, Satan gets the fiercest curse \nfrom the God he rebelled against.\u0014\nThe Lord says to him: Cursed are you above all livestock and all \nwild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all \nthe days of your life (Genesis 3:14).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does this curse mean for Satan?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe serpent was cursed to crawl on its belly. This is strikingly \nsimilar to the fate of our villain in Ezekiel 28 and Isaiah 14, who \nis cast down to the ground (Ezekiel 28:8, 17; Isaiah 14:1112, 15).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut its worse than just getting knocked to the ground. The prophets \nsay this rebel was cast to ?erets, a Hebrew term Heiser says can \nrefer literally to the dirt and metaphorically to the underworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser goes on to explain the serpents fate: The curse also had him \neating dirt, clearly a metaphorical reference, since snakes dont \nreally eat dirt as food for nutrition. It isnt part of the natural \nsnake diet. The point being made by the curse is that the nachash \n[Hebrew word translated serpent in our Bible], who wanted to be \nmost high, will be most low insteadcast away from God and the \ncouncil to earth, and even under the earth. In the underworld, the \nnachash is even lower than the beasts of the field. He is hidden from \nview and from life in Gods world. His domain is death.\u0014\n \u0014\n4. Satan rules the nations of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author of 1 John states that the whole world is under the \ncontrol of the evil one (5:19), and other passages of the New \nTestament specifically point to the devils control over the nations \nof the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, pay attention to Satans final offer as he tempts Jesus \nin the wilderness:\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all \nthe kingdoms of the world and their splendor. All this I will give \nyou, he said  (Matthew 4:89).\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no indication that Satan was bluffing here. In fact, in \nJohns gospel, Jesus calls him the prince of this world (John \n12:31; 14:30; 16:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did Satan get so much power?\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser suggests that Satan accumulated this power over the time \nbetween the Tower of Babel incident and the Jesus ministry:\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the original rebel, the nachash [the Hebrew word for serpent] \nof Genesis 3 (cf. Rev. 12:9) had, by New Testament times, achieved \nthe status of the lead opposition to Yahweh. This was part of the \nlogic of attributing the term satan to him as a proper personal name. \nRecall as well that the nachash has been cast down to the ?erets, a \nterm that referred not only to earth but also the realm of the \ndead, Sheol.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe original rebel, whose domain became earth/Sheol, nachash/Satan \nwas perceived by Second Temple and New Testament theology as primary \nauthority over all other rebels and their domains.\u0014\n \u0014\n5. Satan commands his own host of demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of Jesus ministry, Satan had not only attained power \nover all the nations of the earth, but he had also amassed a \nfollowing of demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews of Jesus time believed that Satan was the ruler of the \ndemons. In fact, some even claimed that it was only by Satans power \nthat Jesus could cast out demons the way he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jesus says this isnt the case: How can Satan drive out Satan? \nIf a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If \na house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if \nSatan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand (Mark 3:2326).\u0014\n\u0014\nFreeing people from the influence of these demons was a major part of \nChrists earthly ministrywhich makes sense, as Jesus came into the \nworld to destroy the devils work (1 John 3:8).\u0014\n\u0014\n6. The Bible doesnt say he rules ALL the demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nScripture doesnt give us a cut-and-dry picture of the divine \nhierarchy, good or evil. So while we can assume Satan is the most \nprominent of Gods adversaries, we shouldnt necessarily assume that \nall Gods divine opponents are under Satans control.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeres how Heiser puts it: It is clear that Satan is leader of at \nleast some of the powers of darkness. As the original rebel, he \nlikely ranked first (or worst) in terms of example in the minds of \nancient readers. The fact that he is the one who confronted Jesus in \nthe desert [] and offered Jesus the kingdoms of the world suggests \nas much. The lack of a clearly delineated hierarchy leaves the \npossibility that there are competing agendas in the unseen world, \neven where there exists the common goal of opposition to Yahweh and \nhis people.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. The devil tried to make at least one deal.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaking deals with the devil is a common storytelling motif. And \nalthough the Bible doesnt say anything about fiddles made of gold, \nScripture does tell us of at least one attempted bargain Satan tried \nto make.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe looked at Satans attempts to tempt Jesus earlier in this list. \nSatan offered all the kingdoms of the world to Jesus.\u0014\nBut there was a catch: Jesus would have to bow down and worship the \ndevil.\u0014\n\u0014\nLucky for us, the Son of God will not be bartered with in this way. \nJesus tells the tempter, Away from me, Satan! For it is written: \nWorship the Lord your God, and serve him only (Matthew 4:10).\u0014\n \u0014\nWhy is Jesus refusal to bargain important?\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser explains that Satans offer was a clever attempt to get Jesus \nto pay for something Satan stole. Had Jesus given in, it would have \nbeen an acknowledgment that Satans permission was needed to possess \nthe nations. It wasnt. Satan presumed power and ownership of \nsomething that, ultimately, was not his but Gods. The messaging \nbehind Jesus answer is clear: Yahweh will take the nations back by \nhis own means in his own time. He doesnt need them to be given away \nin a bargain. Jesus was loyal to his Father. Since reclaiming the \nnations was connected with salvation and redemption from the effects \nof the fall in Eden, accepting Satans offer would have undermined \nthe necessity of the atonement of the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Satan is on the defensive\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the Garden of Eden until the time of Jesus, Satan continued to \naccumulate power. Like we saw earlier, he had grown powerful enough \nto demand that Jesus worship him in exchange for the nations Jesus \nhad come to redeem.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut after Jesus resisted his temptations, the game changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn all three synoptic gospels, Jesus does three things after his \ntrial in the wilderness:\u0014\n1.\tHe proclaims that the kingdom of God is at hand.\u0014\n2.\tHe begins choosing his disciples.\u0014\n3.\tHe begins casting out demons.\u0014\nYou can already start to see Satans power coming undone. But it gets \neven better.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, Peter famously confesses that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of \nGod (Matthew 16:16). Jesus responds, I tell you that you are Peter, \nand on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will \nnot overcome it (16:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a dramatic statement of Jesus (and our) impending victory \nover the devil. This should inform our outlook on Satan and spiritual \nwarfare in general. Were not holed up in a bunker, waiting for some \nheavenly air raid to rescue us from an all-too-powerful foe. Were \nalready winning.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser puts it this way: Gates are defensive structures, not \noffensive weapons. The kingdom of God is the aggressor. [] It is the \ngates of hell that are under assaultand they will not hold up \nagainst the Church. Hell will one day be Satans tomb.\u0014\nThe apostle Paul is even more direct: The God of peace will soon \ncrush Satan under your feet (Romans 16:20).\u0014\n \u0014\n9. Satan is a liar by nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus tells us that lying is second nature to the devil. He doesnt \nsugarcoat it, either:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for \nthere is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native \nlanguage, for he is a liar and the father of lies (John 8:44).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostles tell us that our enemy is a great deceiver, too. When \nearly church member Ananias makes a shady donation, Peter asks, how \nis it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the \nHoly Spirit [] ? (Acts 5:3). And Paul later tells the Corinthian \nchurch that the serpent deceived Eve through cunning lies (2 \nCorinthians 11:3), and goes on to say that Satan himself masquerades \nas an angel of light (11:14).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Satans deceitfulness doesnt stop with Satan. And his followers \narent limited to the unseen realm, either.\u0014\nUnfortunately, there are others under Satans influence.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Satan has spiritual children, just like God does.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament often refers to God as our Father, and to believers \nas children of God. This is obviously a spiritual statement, not a \nbiological one. Were part of Gods spiritual family. We live under \nGods roof, abide by his rules, and enjoy the benefits of being his.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, God isnt the only spiritual father the Bible speaks of. \nSatan has children, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis comes up multiple times in the New Testament:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn the same passage where Jesus calls Satan the father of lies, he \ntells the Jews who want to kill him: You belong to your father, the \ndevil, and you want to carry out your fathers desires (John 8:44).\u0014\n\tWhen the disciples ask Jesus to explain his parable of the wheat and \ntares, Jesus tells them that the good seed represents the sons of his \nkingdom, while the tares represent the sons of the evil one (Matthew \n13:3640).\u0014\n\tThe newly converted apostle Paul tells a sorcerer: You are a child \nof the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full \nof all kinds of deceit and trickery (Acts 13:10).\u0014\n\tAnd in his first epistle, John says the children of the devil are \nevident based on their sinful behavior and their lack of love for \ntheir brothers and sisters (1 John 3:10).\u0014\n\u0014\nLike most things involving Satan, this concept goes right back to \nGenesis.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen God cursed the serpent, he put enmity not only between the devil \nand the woman, but between both of their descendants.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a way, this prophecy is partially fulfilled in the very next \nchapter of Genesis, in the story of Cain and Abel. One brother was \nrighteous, and the other was a murderer. John even uses them as a \ncase study for the differences between the children of God and the \nchildren of the devilhe goes so far as to say that Cain was of the \nevil one (1 John 3:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nHeiser notes that the rest of the biblical story doesnt consist of \nhumans battling snake people. Thats no surprise, since the enemy of \nhumanity wasnt a mere snake. The Bible does, however, describe an \nongoing conflict between followers of Yahweh and human and divine \nbeings who follow the spiritual path of the nachash.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. Satan influenced Judas Iscariot.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn tells us that the devil had been prompting Judas Iscariot to \nbetray Jesus before the night of the Last Supper (John 13:2). Both \nJohn and Luke say that the devil entered Judas on the night he \nbetrayed his Lord (John 13:27; Luke 22:3).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible doesnt give us the mechanics of what happened here. But it \nis important to note that on this occasion, Satan found it necessary \nto be personally involved in making sure Jesus died.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, if Satan could do it all over, he probably wouldnt have \ntaken this course of action. Jesus death was not the victory Satan \nthought it was.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. Satans power of death is broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt turns out that Jesus death broke at least some of Satans deathly \npower. The author of Hebrews explains it this way:\u0014\n\u0014\nSince the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their \nhumanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who \nholds the power of deaththat is, the devil15 and free those who all \ntheir lives were held in slavery by their fear of death (Heb. \n2:1415).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe power of death is waning. Paul claims that death will be \nswallowed up in victory (1 Corinthians 15:54). And in the book of \nRevelation, Christ proclaims, I was dead, and now look, I am alive \nfor ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades \n(Revelation 1:18).\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Discord gives Satan an advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Satans power is broken, hes not powerless yet. In fact, some \nNew Testament passages tell us that there are certain ways for the \ndevil to gain a tactical advantage against us.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle Paul indicates that anger, unforgiveness, and resentment \nbetween Christians give Satan a particular edge.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have several examples in Scripture of this:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tPaul encourages the church at Corinth to forgive and reassure any \nrepentant believer who may have caused the rest of the church grief. \nThe apostle urges the church to make such a person feel welcome and \nloved. Why? Because Paul particularly does not want Satan to outwit \nthem (2 Corinthians 2:11).\u0014\n\tPaul tells married couples not to deprive one another sexually, \notherwise Satan will capitalize on the deprived spouses lack of \nself-control (1 Corinthians 7:5).\u0014\n\tPaul tells the Ephesians not to let the sun go down on their anger, \nso as not to give the devil a foothold (Ephesians 4:2627).\u0014\n         Satan can (and must) be resisted, and we need to be vigilant \nagainst giving him any opportunities to get the better of us (James \n4:7; 1 Peter 5:89).\u0014\n\u0014\n14. Satans defeat is certain, and imminent.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though our adversary may gain a tactical advantage here and \nthere, his fate is sealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn the Revelator sees the ultimate end of Satan, the devil, the \nserpent of old:\u0014\nAnd the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of \nburning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been \nthrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever (Rev. \n20:10).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible doesnt tell us exactly when this will happen. But we can \ntrust that the war will be won. Satan will be defeated, and God will \nultimately run the universe in partnership with his human \nimage-bearers.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nSatan in the Bible is Gods chief enemy, and therefore our chief \nenemy. Through Christs death and resurrection, his power is broken \nand his fate is sealedbut we still need to be vigilant so as not to \ngive him an advantage in leading us astray.\u0014",

    "title": "SUBSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT",
    "words": "Substitutionary atonement, articulated by Anselm of Canterbury in \n1098, became the theological justification for the mass. His friend \nPope Urban II launched the first crusade in 1095, promising that \nthose who fought, killed, and died for Christ would earn debt relief \nfor their survivors, avoid purgatory, and gain immediate entrance \ninto heaven. Anselm insisted that the only reason for the existence \nof Jesus Christ was to pay the debt humanity owed to God, who was \nsupremely offended by human sinfulness and who required a perfect \nsacrifice to restore his honor. And he advised stirring up fear of \nhell as a daily devotional practice to keep the faithful in line.\u0014\n\u0014\nAtonement theology was preached throughout Europe to recruit \ncrusaders. Killing or being killed for Christ became a form of pious \ndevotion to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnselms critic Peter Abelard opposed the first crusade and \nchallenged substitutionary theory on ethical grounds: Who will \nforgive God for killing his own son? Abelards alternative version \nof the atonement makes Jesus a moral exemplar who accepts undeserved \nsuffering on humanitys behalf. His theory roots redemption not in \nfear of hell but in trauma bonds, selfless love, and the \nsanctification of brokenhearted sorrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth theories of atonement, however, require killing as the necessary \ntransaction that restores sinners to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 16th century, European colonizers sailed on ships to the \nAmericas, driven by atonement-based theologies, messianic \nexpectations of the end of the world, and a quest for wealth from the \nenvirons of paradise lost. In the cargo holds they carried the \nnightmares of moral injuries caused by half a millennium of warfare \nin Europe and by the massive travails of the 14th century, when \nEurope was stricken by recurring cycles of plague, climate change, \nand famineand by religious upheavals that stirred up apocalyptic \nfevers and undermined church authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nHumanistic ideas of the Renaissance challenged the imperial papal \nchurch, and warring sects aligned with emerging new empires, which \nsent colonizers out to the world to enhance their fortunes. After the \nindigenous people they enslaved in the Americas began to die of \ndisease and violence in large numbers, the colonizers cargo holds \ncarried enslaved Africans, whom they believed could be redeemed by \nsuffering and captivity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Protestants who landed on the northern Atlantic coast at the \nstart of the 17th century had rejected the authority of the official \nchurch and isolated themselves in a purified Christianity pared \ndown to a segregated elect, defined by the atonement in theology, \npiety, and worship. In re-creating their nostalgic ideal of a New \nTestament church in the New World, the New England Puritans sought to \nhasten the destruction of evil and the arrival of a new heaven and \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey interpreted suffering, especially the horrors of the 1675 King \nPhilips War against the Wampanoag, as a sign of divine love. They \nbelieved God used the war to pull them back into greater piety, \npointing an arrow at their hearts (a phrase from Jonathan Edwardss \nfamous sermon, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God). And in 1637, \nwhen the Puritans burned a Pequot village to the ground, Puritan \nleader William Bradford called the rising smoke a sweet sacrifice to \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFull article:  My Docucments/ An epidemic of moral injury\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have an opportunity to transform a faith that has fueled \ngenocide, slavery, war, and kleptocracy.\u0014\nby Rita Nakashima Brock\u0014\nSeptember 1, 2021   Christian Century\u0014",

Growth of this Reform church \nwas rapid in Gallic lands. Within a hundred years it had won a \nmillion and a half converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome French leaders saw in the emergence of this sect a chance to \ncatapult themselves to power. Unfortunately, this led to a succession \nof wars in which the Huguenots, fighting against overwhelming odds, \nwon enough victories to force concessions from Catholic France, but \nnever took the throne. One of these concessions was the Edict of \nNantes. Gradually it was gnawed away by government officials and \noverzealous prelates. Consequently many Huguenots began to migrate \noverseas, hoping to improve their lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the Christian sects which emerged from the Reformation, the \nAnabaptists and Huguenots suffered the most. The atrocities committed \nagainst both have filled books. One of the bloodiest and most \nsenseless acts of butchery against the Huguenots occurred in Florida \non this day September 20, 1565.\u0014\n\u0014\nColonies of Huguenots had struggled to establish themselves in \nFlorida for several years. The Huguenots at St. Johns expected \ntrouble when Spanish captain Pedro Menndez sailed into the area. \nSpain, after all, claimed the New World and had no use for the French \nand especially French Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne leader of the Huguenots, Laudonnire, wanted to throw up a fort. \nHe was overruled by Ribault, commander of the whole expedition. \nRibault had determined on a naval battle (he had seven ships). \nUnfortunately Ribault's ships were wrecked in a storm and the unhappy \nHuguenot refugees on shore were left to fend for themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nMenndez landed with 2,600 men. He butchered all the men he could lay \nhands on but spared women and children. Laudonnire fled with a few \nmen in a small remaining boat and eventually reached France. Ribault \nand those who had escaped the shipwreck, about 350 in all, asked for \nterms of surrender. Menendez said they must trust themselves to his \nmercy. It appears he swore an oath to spare them. Two hundred who \ndistrusted him fled into the wilderness. The rest surrendered.\u0014\n\u0014\nRibault reminded Menndez that Spain and France were at peace. That \nmattered little to the cruel Spaniard. Menndez wrote the king: \"I \nhad their hands tied behind their backs and themselves put to the \nsword. It appeared to me that by thus chastising them, God our Lord \nand your Majesty were served. Whereby this evil sect will in future \nleave us more free to plant the gospel in these parts.\" When the \nmatter became known in Europe there was a tremendous outcry from all \ndecent men, Catholic and Protestant alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remaining 200 Huguenots put up such fierce resistance that they \nwere finally promised their lives if they surrendered. They were \nconsigned to the Spanish galleys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAvery, Elroy McKendree.

    "words": "About substitutionary atonement.  Biblically it began with substitute \nsacrifice when Moses declared that all Israelite firstborn belonged \nto God because they had been spared in the Passover when all Egyptian \nfirstborn died. A lamb could be sacrificed instead of a son because \nGod had prohibited human sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham. A more \nvaluable animal (an ass) could be kept instead of having its neck \nbroken by the substitute sacrifice of a lamb.  As the Mosaic tenets \nabout Kiper (covering, expiating sin - atonement is a KJV \nintroduction into biblical language) developed, the practice of \nanimal sacrifice as a substitute penalty for human guilt became \ncentral to Jewish faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n Paul established \"substitutionary atonement\" as a Christian \nunderstanding of the meaning of the crucifixion of Jesus.  He did not \nget this from the teachings of Jesus, for he does not cite any of his \nteachings as coming from Jesus.  I believe his faith came from \nindoctrination in post-Exilic Judaism (which included the Eden story \nbut which was not a part of Israelite tradition until after the \nExile) in the rabbinical school of Gamaliel where he affirms he grew \nup.  \u0014\n\u0014\nIt became the early and traditional Cross-centered tenet through his \nearly influential missionary work and letters, which became the first \nwidely used writings in the early churches, a full generation before \nthe Gospels were written from the developed traditions of Jesus' life \nand teachings.  It does indeed seem that \"atonement theology\" has put \na distinctive \"stamp\" on the character of God, in contrast to \naffirmations that \"God is love,\" which have been used by some streams \nof the church is very \"unChristian\" ways.  \u0014\n\u0014\nSherrill Stevens\u0014",

    "title": "SOUTHWESTERN SEMINARY LEGACY: J. FRANK NORRIS",
    "words": "SWBTS Legacy: J. Frank Norris\u0014\nO.S. HAWKINS | JUL 18, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory has forgotten the primary and pivotal role John Franklyn \nNorris (1877-1952) played in the establishing of the Southwestern \nBaptist Theological Seminary in its home on a hill in south Fort \nWorth in 1910. Norris, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Fort \nWorth (1909-1952), was a legendary leader in his day, and his church \nbecame the largest church in America. At the dedication of First \nBaptists new auditorium 10 years into his pastorate in 1919, The \nFort Worth Record reported, Total attendance for the day was more \nthan twelve thousand, with at least two thousand turned away, and 200 \nconverts were added to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorris legacy is a strange mixture of both fact and fiction. His \nperplexing personality seemed to live a life of perpetual paradox. If \never a man lived up to his nickname, The Texas Tornado, it was \nNorris. He was one of the most colorful and controversial figures in \nTexas history. From both his pen and his pulpit, he would often swoop \ndown out of a dark cloud, strike with dastardly force, and leave in \nhis wake the ruins of lives and even legacies. While most \n20th-century Baptist historians have revered the likes of L.R. \nScarborough and George W. Truett, they have likewise reviled the \nlegacy of J. Frank Norris. But there is the rest of the story that \nbegs to be recorded for posterity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the beginning, Norris was the consummate denominational loyalist. \nTutored by the legendary B.H. Carroll at Baylor University, he was an \nhonors graduate at the university and valedictorian of the Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminarys class of 1905. Upon graduation from \nseminary, he moved to Dallas, where he eventually became \nowner/publisher/editor of The Baptist Standard while still in his \n20s. This position afforded young Norris a visible platform to \npromote the work of Baptists throughout the state of Texas and \ncatapulted him into denominational prominence.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, down in Waco at Baylor, Carroll had dreams of expanding \nthe universitys Bible department into a full-fledged seminary and \nmoving it to the rapidly growing Dallas-Fort Worth area. Although \nTruett would later serve for years as a Southwestern Seminary trustee \nand board chair and would be memorialized by having the campus \nauditorium named in his honor, he originally tried to form a \ncoalition, consisting of A.J. Barton, J.B. Gambrell, and S.P. Brooks, \namong others, to oppose and prevent Carrolls dream from coming to \nfruition.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to historian H. Leon McBeth, Carroll encountered massive \nopposition from this Truett-led coalition of respected Texas \nBaptists. Even though he opposed the move, by the sheer power of his \npersonality, Truett had been appointed chair of the committee to find \na new site for the fledging institution. In hopes of dampening the \nspirit of the move, he recommended two small lots in the Oak Cliff \nsection of Dallas, which infuriated Carroll.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter dated March 30, 1909, Carroll let Truett know in no \nuncertain terms that he considered this recommendation an insult, and \nhe did not intend the new seminary to be A TWO BY FOUR INSTITUTION.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorris seized the moment. He loved Carroll and had revered him since \nhis days at Baylor. Norris began a series of weekly articles on the \nfront page of The Baptist Standard promoting Carroll and the move of \nthe seminary to a site made available by the city fathers of Fort \nWorth on a hill south of town.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose opposing the seminary move became irate with Norris for his \nadvocacy and what they considered to be an unbalanced approach in the \nweekly tabloid. Truett convened a gathering of the directors of the \nStandard to remove Norris as editor. Norris was not only editor, \nhowever, but the majority stockholder, so he, at the same time, \nconvened a meeting of the stockholders and subsequently dismissed all \nthe directors. Many point to this incident as the beginning of an \nopen hostility between Truett and Norris that would ensue for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorris campaign caught on and won the hearts and minds of Texas \nBaptists. Thus, at the annual state convention meeting at Truetts \nown First Baptist Church of Dallas in 1909, it was young Norrisnot \nTruettstanding beside the tall and stately Carroll on the platform \nmaking the appeal for the move of the seminary to Fort Worth. As \nhistorian Robert A. Baker would later recount, Norris invoked in \nunbroken eloquence, Not since Peter preached at Pentecost and \nbaptized three thousand converts has there been anything more \nglorious than the founding, endowing and locating of Southwestern \nBaptist Theological Seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, what was destined one day to become the largest seminary in all \nthe world found its new home on a hill in Fort Worth, and in no small \npart because of the efforts and influence of a young J. Frank Norris.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few months later, upon the recommendation of Carroll, Norris was \ncalled to be the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth. \nOnce there in his new church, Norris set out to raise the money to \nundergird the seminary and to build its first building.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Norris was in Fort Worth \nto meet members of the church and to confer with the committee which \nis soliciting subscriptions for the Baptist Theological Seminary. \nTwo days later, the same paper reported, At the First Baptist Church \nDr. J. Frank Norris . . . preached a strong sermon, presenting to his \ncongregation the great benefit that the proposed big seminary would \nconfer, not only on the church, but on the city and humanity and \nChristianity in general. He presented a strong case for the seminary \nand its location here, and his words fell on willing ears.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorris helped raise the $100,000 needed to bring the seminary from \nWaco to Fort Worth. And, in fact, Norris pledged to raise half that \namount from the church, and he did. He did not stop there. He was \nthe driving force behind raising the $200,000 needed to build the \nfledging seminarys first building, named Fort Worth Hall in honor of \nits new hometown, and led the congregants of First Baptist Church to \ngive half of that amount as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorris served faithfully and loyally as a founding trustee of \nSouthwestern Seminary until after the death of Carroll. Ironically, \nafter Carrolls death, the seminary and her new leader, L.R. \nScarborough, would find themselves in the middle of the bullseye of \nsome of Norris most vocal and vitriolic attacks, beginning with the \nencroachment of the theory of evolution within Christian institutions \nof higher learning in the 1920s.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn early 1921, J.A. Rice, a professor at Southern Methodist \nUniversity, began promoting a pro-Darwinian approach to creation. \nThis led Norris on a war path. He was joined by Scarborough, and, \ntogether, their challenges and campaign led to Rices resignation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon thereafter, Baylor professor Grove Samuel Dow published a book \nentitled Introduction to Sociology. Within its pages, he blatantly \nargued in favor of the naturalistic evolutionary process. Norris \nlaunched an assault on this heretical teaching at the bastion of \nBaptist education, resulting in the firing of Dow and eight other \nprofessors. Norris wrongly assumed that Scarborough would join him in \nthis fight, as he did with the one at SMU over the same issue. To his \nutter amazement, Scarborough and Truett remained silent and \nresponded, We dont want to have any stir up about this. . . . You \nwill ruin the 75 Million Campaign.[1] This perceived hypocrisy in \nvaluing denominational loyalty over doctrinal fidelity added to the \ngrowing divide between Norris and the leaders of the Southern Baptist \nConvention in Norris mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome observers think that a deeper part of Norris growing conflict \nwith Scarborough and Southwestern Seminary was that Norris had hoped, \neven expected, to be the handpicked successor to his mentor, Carroll. \nHe saw himself as the true recipient of the charge Carroll gave to \nScarborough to keep the seminary lashed to the cross. He sharply \ndisapproved of many of the changes Scarborough made after the death \nof Carroll, particularly in moving away from the English Bible course \nthat Carroll had implemented and to which he was intensely committed. \nInterestingly, when Norris later founded his own seminary, the Bible \nBaptist Seminary, he reduplicated almost exactly the English Bible \ncourse of B.H. Carroll.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the later decades of his life unfolded, Norris mean-spirited \nnature began to increasingly reveal itself. He would often send \ntelegrams to Truett in the midnight- and early-morning hours on \nSunday to awaken him from his sleep before he was to preach the \nmorning message. He resorted to sending the professors at \nSouthwestern Seminary beautifully wrapped Christmas presents that \nwere placed on their front porches, only for them to find that the \nboxes were filled with all types of rotten fruits.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs one conflict and controversy led to another, Norris drew his own \ncircle smaller and smaller until he had shut out much of what could \nhave been his wider influence and lasting legacy. In the end, \nhowever, he sought to make amends to those with whom he did battle. \nThe Scarborough Archives at Southwestern Seminary contain loving \nletters Norris sent Scarborough as the former seminary president lay \ndying in his daughters home in West Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaymond Barber, a student at Norris seminary during the late 1940s \nand early 1950s, tells the story of taking Norris on a trip one \nparticular morning. As it was, Barber had one of the only automobiles \namong the seminary students in those days. On a given morning and at \nan appointed time, Norris asked the young seminarian to pick him up \nat his office and take him on a brief journey. Barber, accompanied by \nhis brother, Bob, picked the pastor up, and they noted as he stepped \ninto the back seat that he had a beautiful bouquet of flowers in his \nhand. Rather abruptly, he then said, Drive me out west of town.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey drove west of the city until they came to a cemetery. Norris \ninstructed the boys to stay in the car. He walked out across the \nendless tombstones until he went over a small hill and could not be \nseen. After a half-hour, he returned to the car, instructing Barber \nto take him back to his office and for the two of them to hurry back \nto seminary classes. Barber revealed that upon dropping the pastor at \nthe church office, they headed straight back to the cemetery. They \njourneyed across the hundreds of tombstones until they spotted the \nbouquet of flowers Norris had brought. They found them on the grave \nof Lee Rutland Scarborough.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthwestern Seminary grew from its birth to become the largest \nseminary in the world, sending multiplied thousands of her graduates \nto the international mission fields, as well as pulpits of churches \nand teaching lecterns in colleges and seminaries too numerous to \nmention. Among J. Frank Norris many accomplishments, none have had \nmore lasting Kingdom value and impact than his tireless, bold, and \nstrategic efforts in the establishing of the Southwestern Baptist \nTheological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n[1] The 75 Million Campaign was a national effort by Southern \nBaptists to raise $75 million over a five-year period for missions \nand ministry. Both Truett and Scarborough were national campaign \nleaders.\u0014",

    "title": "SOUND DOCTRINE NOT DEFINED IN SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "DOCTRINE\u0014\n\u0014\nApostolic Doctrines: The earliest teaching of the apostles consisted \nessentially of three propositions: (a) that Jesus was the Christ \n(Acts 3:18); (b) that He was risen from the dead (Acts 1:22; \n2:24,32); and (c) that salvation was by faith in His name (Acts 2:38; \n3:16). While proclaiming these truths, it was necessary to coordinate \nthem with Hebrew faith, as based upon Old Testament revelation. The \nmethod of the earliest reconstruction may be gathered from the \nspeeches of Peter and Stephen (Acts 2:14-36; 5:29-32; 7:2-53). A more \nthorough reconstruction of the coordination of the Christian facts, \nnot only with Hebrew history, but with universal history, and with a \nview of the world as a whole, was undertaken by Paul. Both types of \ndoctrine are found in his speeches in Acts, the former type in that \ndelivered at Antioch (13:16-41), and the latter in the speeches \ndelivered at Lystra (14:15-17) and at Athens (17:22-31). The ideas \ngiven in outline in these speeches are more fully developed into a \ndoctrinal system, with its center removed from the resurrection to \nthe death of Christ, in the epistles, especially in Galatians, \nRomans, Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians. But as yet it is \ntheological system of one teacher, and there is no sign of any \nattempt to impose it by authority on the church as a whole. As a \nmatter of fact the Pauline system never was generally accepted by the \nchurch. Compare James and the Apostolic Fathers..\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginnings of Dogma: In the Pastoral and General Epistles a new state \nof things appears. The repeated emphasis on \"sound\" or \"healthy \ndoctrine\" (1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1), \"good \ndoctrine\" (1 Tim 4:6) implies that a body of teaching had now emerged \nwhich was generally accepted, and which should serve as a standard of \northodoxy. The faith has become a body of truth \"once for all \ndelivered unto the saints\" (Jude verse 3). The content of this \"sound \ndoctrine\" is nowhere formally given, but it is a probable inference \nthat it corresponded very nearly to the Roman formula that became \nknown as the Apostles' Creed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(from International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, Electronic Database \nCopyright  1996, 2003, 2006 by Biblesoft, Inc.\u0014",

    "title": "SCRIPTURE TWISTING",
    "words": "A Brief Definition of Twenty Reading Errors\u0014\n\u0014\nhe following list is designed to be a handy reference to the reading \nerrors which have been defined and illustrated in detail in the \nforegoing pages. The page references following each of the \ndefinitions refer to the longer sections devoted to each reading \nerror.\u0014\n1. Inaccurate Quotation: A biblical text is referred to but is either \nnot quoted in the way the text appears in any standard translation or \nis wrongly attributed. Example: the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says, \nChrist said, Be still and know that I am God. This text is found \nonly in the psalms. (pp. 32-34)\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Twisted Translation: The biblical text is retranslated, not in \naccordance with sound Greek scholarship, to fit the pre conceived \nteachings of a cult. Example: the Jehovahs Wit nesses translate John \n1:1 as In [the] beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, \nand the Word was a god. (pp. 34-38)\u0014\n\u0014\n3. The Biblical Hook: A text of Scripture is quoted primarily as a \ndevice to grasp the attention of readers or listeners and then \nfollowed by teaching which is so nonbiblical that it would appear far \nmore dubious to most people had it not been preceded by a reference \nto Scripture. Example: Mormon missionaries quote James 1:5 which \npromises Gods wisdom to those who ask him and follow this by \nexplaining that when Joseph Smith did this he was given a revelation \nfrom which he concluded that God the Father has a body. (pp. 41-50)\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Ignoring the Immediate Context: A text of Scripture is quoted but \nremoved from the surrounding verses which form the immediate \nframework for its meaning. Example: Alan Watts quotes the first half \nof John 5:39 (You search the Scriptures, because you think that in \nthem you have eternal life), claiming that Jesus was challenging his \nlisteners overemphasis of the Old Testament, but the remainder of \nthe immediate context reads, and it is they that bear witness to me; \nyet you refuse to come to me that you may have life (vv. 3 9-40), \nwhich shows that Jesus was upholding the value of the Old Testament \nas a testimony to himself. (pp. 52-58)\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Collapsing Contexts: Two or more verses which have little or \nnothing to do with each other are put together as if one were a \ncommentary on the other(s).. Example: the Mormons associate Jeremiah \n1:5 with John 1:2, 14 and thus imply that both verses talk about the \npremortal existence of all human beings; Jeremiah 1:5, however, \nspeaks of Gods foreknowledge of Jeremiah (not his premortal \nexistence) and John 1:2 refers to the pre of God the Son and not to \nhuman beings in general. (pp. 58-62)\u0014\n6. Overspecification: A more detailed or specific conclusion than is \nlegitimate is drawn from a biblical text. Example: the Mormon \nmissionary manual quotes the parable of the virgins (Mt. 25:1-13) to \ndocument the concept that mortality is a probationary period during \nwhich we prepare to meet God. But the parable of the virgins \ncouldand most probably doesmean something far less specific, for \nexample, that human being should be prepared at any time to meet God \nor to witness the Second Coming of Christ. (pp.\u0014\n62-64)\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Word Play: A word or phrase from a biblical translation is \nexamined and interpreted as if the revelation had been given in that \nlanguage. Example: Mary Baker Eddy says the name, Adam consists of \ntwo syllables, A dam, which means an obstruction, in which case Adam \nsignifies the obstacle which the serpent, sin, would impose between \nman and his Creator. (pp. 64-66)\u0014\n8. The Figurative Fallacy: Either (1) mistaking literal language for \nfigurative language or (2) mistaking figurative language for literal \nlanguage. Example of(1): Mary Baker Eddy interprets evening as \nmistiness of moral thought; weariness of mortal mind; obscured \nviews; peace and rest. Example of (2): the Mormon theologian James \nTalmage interprets the prophecy that thou shalt be brought down and \nspeak out of the ground to mean that Gods Word would come to people \nfrom the Book of Mormon which was taken out of the ground at the hill \nof Cumorah. (pp.66-\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Speculative Readings of Predictive Prophecy: A predictive prophecy \nis too readily explained by the occurrence of specific events, \ndespite the fact that equally committed biblical scholars consider \nthe interpretation highly dubious. Example: the stick of Judah and \nthe stick of Joseph in Ezekiel 37:15-23 are interpreted by the \nMormons to mean the Bible and the Book of Mormon. (pp. 70-74)\u0014\n10. Saying but Not Citing: A writer says that the Bible says such and \nsuch but does not cite the specific text (which often indicates that \nthere may be no such text at all). Example: someone says, The Bible \nsays, God helps those who help themselves. Or Erich von Dniken \nsays, Without actually consulting Exodus, I seem to remember that \nthe Ark was often surrounded by flashing sparks. (pp. 76-80)\u0014\n\u0014\n11. Selective Citing: To substantiate a given argument, only a \nlimited number of texts is quoted: the total teaching of Scripture on \nthat subject would lead to a conclusion different from that of the \nwriter. Example: the Jehovahs Wit nesses critique the traditional \nChristian notion of the Trinity without considering the full set of \ntexts which scholars use to substantiate the concept. (pp. 80-82)\u0014\n12. Inadequate Evidence: A hasty generalization is. drawn from too \nlittle evidence. Example: the Jehovahs Witnesses teach that blood \ntransfusion is nonbiblical, but the biblical data which they cite \nfails either to speak directly to the issue or to adequately \nsubstantiate their teaching. (pp. 82-88)\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Confused Definition: A biblical term is misunderstood in such a \nway that an essential biblical doctrine is distorted or rejected. \nExample: one of Edgar Cayces followers confuses the Eastern doctrine \nof reincarnation with the biblical doc trifle of being born again. \n(pp. 90-96)\u0014\n\u0014\n14. Ignoring Alternative Explanations: A specific interpretation is \ngiven to a biblical text or set of texts which could well be, and \noften have been, interpreted in quite a different fashion, but these \nalternatives are not considered. Example: Erich von Dniken asks why \nin Genesis 1:26 God speaks in the plural ( suggesting that this is \nan oblique reference to Gods being one of many astronauts and \nfailing to consider alternative explanations that either God was \nspeaking as heavens king accompanied by His heavenly hosts or that \nthe plural prefigures the doctrine of the Trinity expressed more \nexplicitly in the New Testament. (pp. 96-99)\u0014\n\u0014\n15. The Obvious Fallacy: Words like obviously, undoubtedly; \ncertainly, all reasonable people hold that and so forth are \nsubstituted for logical reasons. Example: Erich von Dniken says, \nUndoubtedly the Ark [ the Covenant] was electrically charged! (pp. \n99-100)\u0014\n16. Virtue by Association: Either (1) a cult writer associates his or \nher teaching with those of figures accepted as authoritative by \ntraditional Christians; (2) cult writings are likened to the Bible; \nor (3) cult literature imitates the form of Bible writing such that \nit sounds like the Bible. Example of (1): Rick Chapman lists \ntwenty-one gurus, including Jesus, St. Francis and St. Theresa, that \nyou cant go wrong with. Example of (2): Juan Mascaro in his \nintroduction to the Upanishads cites the New Testament, the Gospels, \nEcclesiastes and the Psalms, from which he quotes passages supposedly \nparalleling the Upanishads. Example of (3): the Mormon Doctrine and \nCovenants 93 interweaves phrases from the Gospel of John and \nmaintains a superficial similarity to the Gospel such that it seems \nto be like the Bible. (pp. 101-04)\u0014\n\u0014\n17. Esoteric Interpretation: Under the assumption that the Bible \ncontains a hidden, esoteric, meaning which is open only to those who \nare initiated into its secrets, the interpreter declares the \nsignificance of biblical passages without giving much if any \nexplanation for his or her interpretation. Example: Mary Baker Eddy \ngives the meaning of the first phrase in the Lords Prayer, Our \nFather which art in heaven, as Our Father-Mother God, all \nharmonious. (pp. 107-15)\u0014\n18. Supplementing Biblical Authority: New revelation from \npostbiblical prophets either replaces or is added to the Bible as \nauthority. Example: the Mormons supplement the Bible with the Book of \nMormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. (pp. \n115-18)\u0014\n19. Rejecting Biblical Authority: Either the Bible as a whole or \ntexts from the Bible are examined and rejected because they do not \nsquare with other authoritiessuch as reason and other \nrevelation-which do not appear to agree with them. Example: Archie \nMatson holds that the Bible contains contradictions and that Jesus \nhimself rejected the authority of the Old Testament when he \ncontrasted his own views with it in the Sermon on the Mount. (pp. \n118-24)\u0014\n\u0014\n20. World-View Confusion: Scriptural statements, stories, commands or \nsymbols which have a particular meaning or set of meanings when taken \nwithin the intellectual and broadly cultural framework of the Bible \nitself are lifted out of that context, placed within the frame of \nreference of another system and thus given a meaning that markedly \ndiffers from their intended meaning. Example: the Maharishi Mahesh \nYogi interprets Be still, and know that I am God as meaning that \neach person should meditate and come to the realization that he is \nessentially Godhood itself. (pp. 23-30 and 127-44)\u0014",

    "words": "Swiss Anabaptists' Seven-Point Confession\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Reformation, leaders such as Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin \nentered into political arrangements which gave them legitimacy and a \nmeasure of protection. However, the Anabaptists (who called \nthemselves Brethren), taught that church and state should be \nseparate. Membership in church, and the baptism that went with it, \nmust be preceded by a confession of faith and a changed life. The New \nTestament should be the primary guide to life and should interpret \nthe Old, not the other way around. Shortly after Luther's stand led \nto the Reformation, there had arisen a bizarre cult, often also \ncalled Anabaptist, which took the Old Testament as their rule, \nengaged in revolution and seizing the German city of Munster. This \naction brought fury on the pacifist Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Church and Protestants alike killed and harassed the \nharmless Brethren. So severely did the established churches persecute \nthe Anabaptists that their leadership had to be constantly replaced \nas one after another was martyred. In 1527, the Swiss Brethren met \nunder the leadership of Michael Sattler. He drafted them a confession \nof faith now known as the Schleitheim Confession (At the time, it was \ncalled the Brotherly Agreement of Some Children of God). The Brethren \naccepted it without a dissenting vote on this day, February 24, 1527. \nA few months later, Sattler, too, was martyred.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe confession fell under seven points. The first declared that \nBaptism should be given only to those who had learned repentance and \namendment of life, and truly believed that their sins were taken away \nby Christ. The second point instituted the \"ban.\" If a member \npersisted in sin after two private warnings, the congregation would \nexclude and shun that person. The third point said communion would be \nin memory of Christ not as a sacrament. The fourth separated the \nchurch from state. The fifth gave congregations the selection of \ntheir own pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sixth and seventh points were derived from Christ's teaching and \nexample. These were a prohibition on taking up arms and a repudiation \nof oaths. \"...The weapons of their conflict and war are carnal and \nagainst the flesh only, but the Christian's weapons are spiritual, \nagainst the fortification of the devil. The worldlings are armed with \nsteel and iron, but the Christians are armed with the armor of God, \nwith truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation and the Word of \nGod.\" And \"Christ, who teaches the perfection of the Law, prohibits \nall swearing to His (followers), whether true or false -- neither by \nheaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by our head.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, traditional churches viewed these teachings as \nthreatening. Zwingli and Calvin both denounced them.

    "title": "SCOTTISH REFORMER GEORGE WISHART MARTYRED IN FLAME",
    "words": "SCOTTISH REFORMER GEORGE WISHART WAS MARTYRED IN FLAME\u0014\n \u0014\nGeorge Wishart preached reformation in Scotland between 1543 and \n1546. Cardinal David Beaton reacted violently against him and met \nviolence himself. That, in a nutshell, is the story of the two men.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrained at the University of Aberdeen, Wishart became a teacher of \nGreek. Accused of heresy by the Bishop of Brechlin, apparently with \nsome justification, he fled to England, where he entered Cambridge \nUniversity. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1543 he returned to Scotland where he preached first at Montrose, \nthen at Dundee. While at Dundee he preached on the book of Romans, a \nfavorite of the reformers, but was driven out by the influence of \nCardinal David Beaton.\u0014\n\u0014\nWishart went to Ayr. Beaton ordered the Archbishop of Glasgow to \narrest him, but the Earl of Glencairn protected Wishart. Barred from \nspeaking in church, Wishart preached in the market and in open \nfields. Learning that many in Dundee were dying of plague, he \nreturned there and risked his life caring for the sick, especially \nthe poor. He resumed preaching and large audiences turned out to hear \nhim. \u0014\n\u0014\nCardinal Beaton hired a priest to assassinate the reformer. Wishart, \nsizing up the situation with a glance, seized the priests armto \nprevent him reaching for the knife he was carrying under his \ncloakand disarmed him. The priest fell down and confessed his evil \nintention. The assembled crowd would have killed him had not Wishart \nshielded the man with his own body.\u0014\n\u0014\nWishart set out for Edinburgh to attend a conference of bishops; his \nfriends sought to dissuade him and offered him protection. John Knox \nattempted to accompany him as a bodyguard, but Wishart, certain he \nhimself was about to die, would not permit Knox to sacrifice his life \nalso. At Ormiston, the Earl of Bothwells troops surrounded the place \nwhere Wishart was spending the night. Bothwell took him captive, \nsaying, I promise also in the presence of these gentlemen, that \nneither the governor nor the cardinal shall have their will over you, \nbut I shall retain you in my own hands, and in my own place, till \nthat either I shall make you free, or else restore you in the same \nplace where I receive you.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it turned out, the Earl handed him over to the Cardinal, who \nplaced him on trial for heresy on this day, 1 March 1546. An accuser \nread a list of charges and curses: What answerest thou to these \nsayings, thou runagate, traitor, thief, which we have duly proved, by \nsufficient witnesses against thee? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Wishart tried to respond, he was silenced. If we give him \nlicense to preach, he is so crafty, and in the Holy Scriptures so \nexercised, that he will persuade the people to his opinion, and raise \nthem against us, said the prelates. Consequently, as the accusations \nwere read, he was allowed little chance to answer. Meanwhile the \nbishops openly mocked him. He was condemned and taken out that same \nday to be burned. Two friars called on him to pray to our Lady, that \nshe may be a mediatrix for you to her Son. He refused. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon he was bound at the stake. The cardinal pointed artillery at the \nplace of execution to prevent any attempt at rescue. \u0014\nAmong Wisharts last words was an appeal to the crowd: I beseech \nyou, Christian brethren and sisters, that ye be not offended at the \nWord of God, for the affliction and torments which you see already \nprepared for me. But I exhort you that you love the Word of God, your \nsalvation, and suffer patiently, and with a comfortable heart, for \nthe Word's sake, which is your undoubted salvation and everlasting \ncomfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the executioners plea, Wishart forgave him. When the fire began \nto lick Wisharts body, the executioner pulled tight a cord around \nthe martyrs neck, cutting short his suffering. Today, a plaque near \nthe site of the execution commemorates it, and the letters GW on a \npavement mark the spot where he died at the stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks after Wisharts death, a band of high-born youth entered \nBeatons castle in the guise of workmen, waited for Beatons mistress \nto leave for the day, and stabbed the cardinal to death. They \nsummoned John Knox to become their chaplain. Beaton was the last \nScottish Cardinal before the Reformation; Knox went on to become more \nfamous than Wishart as a Scottish reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Grieving Ornate Churches With So Many Unhoused\u0014\nby Starlette Thomas | Mar 21, 2022 |\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring a recent trip to St. Louis to make a presentation on The \nRaceless Gospel Initiative at Kirkwood Baptist Church, I, along with \nMitch and Missy Randall, visited the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wasnt sure of what to expect, but walking on the marble floors \nmade me want to take a step back. I immediately felt uncomfortable \nand out of place. The lavish display of wealth housed in a sacred \nspace was somewhat overwhelming.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a bare minimum wage that leaves most Americans surviving but not \nthriving, unable to put away savings or consider plans for retiring, \nthe investment in a building just doesnt make sense  not in 1905 \nwhen the basilica was constructed or now.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does God need such a big house? Why does God always need a new \nhouse?\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this what God asked for? We couldnt find a cheaper place for God \nto dwell among us? I know that in the Hebrew Bible God is very \nspecific, but what about now? Jesus has lived here, and he couldnt \nfind anything within his price range.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn between the grand columns, there was a collection box for the \npoor. It was the only thing out of place. The ragged- and \nrugged-looking structure just didnt fit in with all the shiny and \npolished furnishings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a loss for words, I looked up at the ceiling. I couldnt help but \nwonder, How is it that God has so many houses of worship and yet we \ncannot afford to build any for those experiencing poverty and \nhomelessness?\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Americans are just one paycheck away from a cardboard box or a \nshelter if there is space. They cant afford to pay rent, and this is \nhow money given out of love for God is spent?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fair and to be sure, I am asking this question of every church \nin North America. With one on every corner, the extras could be used \nto house and support those experiencing homelessness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause I thought Christians were supposed to share all things in \ncommon so that no one would need a thing (Acts 4:32-35). Maybe that \nwas just for the early church and for church members only?\u0014\n\u0014\nExcept Jesus had other plans if you consider the section on the least \nof these in Matthew 25. Also, Jesus had no place to rest his head \nafter a long day of preaching and teaching (Matthew 8:20).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an aside, can we talk about how little we pay and support \nteachers? Ill stop meddling and go back to writing, only to ask, \nWhat were Jesus priorities?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died with nothing in his pockets. And who knows what Judas was \ndoing with the money? It was the least of Jesus concerns, and it was \nsolely Judas business.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is it then that when we identify with Christ, too often we \nidentify him as a rich, successful businessmen with a security \ndetail? Is it because we have Americanized him and upgraded his \ngospel to first class? Is this the only way that we can justify \nfollowing him?\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause we are not following him to the poor house. No, we follow \nthe money. So, we reimagine Jesus as an enterprising elitist. \nDiscipleship is but another deal we make along the way to our gated \ncommunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre we really following him around or going in capitalistic circles \nto ensure that the money is not circulated? God forbid.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay we, Christians, confess how we have participated in keeping our \nneighbors down and out. If not, then what is this Lenten season all \nabout?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile we acknowledge the suffering body of Christ, we must also get \nin touch with the ways his members have perpetuated it, crucifying \nhim all over again for the sake of plush and shiny stuff that makes \nus feel good.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nStarlette Thomas     Baptist News Global\u0014",

    "words": "St. Peters' New Foundation\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nThe walls of the old church were veined with cracks. Might it not \ncollapse and kill the worshippers within? Nicholas V thought so. He \nsummoned two famous architects with orders to strengthen the historic \nbuilding. Alberti and Rossellino looked it over and came up with a \nplan for new walls.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's basilica, first constructed by Constantine the Great, was \nto be shored up. It sat on the site where tradition says Peter was \nburied when executed in 67 A. D. As early as 90 A. D. an oratory had \nmemorialize the spot. The work was just begun when Nicholas died. \nSucceeding popes let the project lapse.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot until Julius II became pope was the project revived. Julius threw \nout halfway measures, determined to replace the basilica completely. \nAs architect, he appointed Bramante. Bramante drew up huge plans and \noutraged traditionalists by rudely ripping down the old building. He \nshould at least have disassembled the old columns, they sputtered, to \nbe reused. Bramante went ahead with excavation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this date April 11, 1506, Pope Julius laid the foundation stone. \nThe elderly vicar descended deep into the earth on a wobbly rope \nladder to perform the honor. Lack of funds slowed construction. Leo X \nreplaced Julius in 1513 and after Bramante's death in 1514 made \nRaphael the chief architect.\u0014\n\u0014\nWork progressed slowly, due to lack of funds. Raphael never completed \nthe project. Sangello, Verone, Sangallo and Peruzzi also served as \narchitects at one time or another. Eventually Michelangelo was put in \ncharge. He was then in his seventies, but redrew the plans. By the \ntime he died in 1564, the shell of the dome was complete.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe great cathedral was not finished until 1626, 120 years after \nJulius laid the first stone. Then Carlo Maderna completed the facade. \nMen in those times projected their schemes across centuries. It is \none of the most admirable characteristics of the church which \nconfidently expected the body of Christ to survive all ups and downs. \nNeither Bramante's plans nor Michelangelo's were adhered to. \nConsequently the finished building was a series of compromises. \nDespite this it came forth with grandeur, its vast interior \ngloriously decorated. It covers four acres. St. Peter, who admired \nHerod's great temple in Jerusalem and preached and healed in it, \nmight have been astonished at this triumph of religious architecture.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was to pay for Raphael's efforts, by the way, that Leo X \nauthorized the indulgence which led to Luther's 95 theses. \nUnfortunately, the edifice which sums up Catholic tradition and its \npatronage of the arts became a cause of the second greatest division \nin Christendom (the first being the East-West split in 1054) when \nLuther insisted indulgences were not necessary for Christians who can \ngo directly to their Savior for forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "DEATH OF SOR JUANA INS DE LA CRUZ, THE NUN OF MEXICO\u0014\n \u0014\nJuana Ramrez de Asbaje was born with a strike against her: she was \nillegitimate, euphemistically called a daughter of the church. Her \nfather was a Spanish captain who ignored her existence, but thanks to \nher maternal grandfather she grew up in easy circumstances and \nexposed to books. The year of her birth is uncertain, usually pegged \nas 1651 (when she was baptized) but perhaps as early as 1648. She was \nreading and writing Latin by the age of three and would go on to \nlearn Greek and Nahuatl (an Aztec language). At eight, she wrote her \nfirst poem. Poetry would be the category of composition in which she \nwould be most facile. Three years earlier, she is supposed to have \nlearned to keep accounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nJuana earnestly desired learning. As a teen she pleaded to be allowed \nto dress as a boy so she could take university classes but her family \nsaid no. Meanwhile she taught herself every subject that scholars \ncommonly learned, taught other girls Latin, and made an impression on \nher contemporaries. At sixteen she became the companion of the \nViceroys wife and at seventeen she impressed a delegation of forty \nscholars with sound answers to a wide range of questions. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuitors sought her hand because she was attractive, but she preferred \na path that would enable her to pursue learning. At first she entered \nthe Monastery of San Jose (St. Joseph) but soon left it for Santa \nPaula, a Hieronymite monastery, named for the female sponsor of the \ngreat biblical scholar Jerome who held much converse with intelligent \nwomen. There she became a nun, Sor [Sister] Juana Ins de la Cruz. \nHer apartment served as a salon where she received men and women for \nintellectual discussion. She acquired a large personal library and \nstudied hermeneutics (scriptural interpretation), history, logic, \nmathematics, music, natural philosophy, poetry, rhetoric, and \ntheology. Most of her output was poeticshe said she did violence to \nherself not to write in verse. Stephanie Merrim calls her the last \ngreat writer of the Hispanic Baroque and the first great exemplar of \ncolonial Mexican culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough she addressed many lines to Mary, other poems exalted \nChrist. For instance, here is the first stanza of Hymn for the Feast \nof the Incarnation:\u0014\n\u0014\n            Divine Love this day\u0014\n            became incarnate,\u0014\n            a gift so precious as to give\u0014\n            all other gifts their worth.\u0014\n\u0014\nMale contemporaries attacked her. She broke with her Jesuit confessor \nbecause he maligned her. Without her permission, Bishop Manuel \nFernndez de Santa Cruz published a letter she wrote criticizing a \nsermon by Antnio Vieira, a well-known Jesuit preacher of the \nprevious generation. This drew establishment wrath upon her. In \nresponse, she wrote a famed defense of female scholarship. In the end \nshe was forced to give up literary pursuits and sold her library and \nscientific instruments to help the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring a severe epidemic shortly afterward, Juana contracted the \ndisease while nursing sick nuns. Juana Ins de la Cruz died on this \nday, 17 April 1695, about forty-five years old. Nicknames for her \nincluded Mexican Phoenix, The Tenth Muse, and The Nun of \nMexico. Her portrait was painted by contemporaries and by posthumous \nadmirers, including Miguel Cabrera. Mexico has honored her on its \n200-peso bill.\u0014",

Heres what they said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Anna Brand  NBC News\u0014\nMay 7, 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of thousands of women opt to get an abortion in this country \nevery year. And thats just whats been recorded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are 600,000 abortions each year, on average, in the U.S, \naccording to the CDC. The Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights \ngroup, puts that number even higher, at almost 900,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Roe v. Wade is overturned, nearly two dozen states are likely to \nban abortions or severely restrict access to the procedure. Thirteen \nhave \"trigger laws\" that would ban abortion almost immediately, \naccording to an NBC News analysis of data from the Center for \nReproductive Rights. Whether abortion remains legal would be left up \nto individual states, forcing some people to travel out of state to \nlegally end a pregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe asked our readers: How has getting an abortion  or deciding not \nto  changed your life? How has having access to an abortion clinic \naffected your decision? Heres what they wrote to us. Some of the \nsubmissions have been edited for space and clarity.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy mother told me in my late 60s that she wished I hadn't been born. \nThankfully my fraternal grandparents raised me. Thankfully abortion \nwasn't an option at that time. I wouldn't be here nor my two kids and \ntwo grandsons.\u0014\n Lyn Roetzel / Sioux Falls, S.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy wife and I have three beautiful children. However, that would not \nbe without access to abortion. [With] an ectopic pregnancy, it was \ndevastating that we had to choose one life over another. But we did  \nand to our surprise the doctor recommended continuing to try. After \nthe elective abortion, we had two more healthy babies.\u0014\n Jamie Doherty / Torrington, Conn.\u0014\n\u0014\nI grew up pro-choice. When I found out I was pregnant at 20, I was \nscared, frustrated and defensive. I chose to keep my child and I \nfound a way to work through my shortcomings. But if I had been \ntrapped, forced to step into parenthood, it would have been a very \ndifferent world for everyone around me. I want my great- grandkids to \nexperience the process and consequence of choice. Empowered to make \nthose high-stakes decisions. Because that's just the first one they \nwill make about their family.\u0014\n Julie Davies / Salem, Ore.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was scared to have an abortion because of the stigma. I purchased \npills online, took them at home and almost bled to death. I then \nsought out legal abortion services. Abortive services allowed me to \nget out of a bad situation without being beaten for being pregnant. I \nbecame a nurse and wanted to give back to the community that helped \nme. This decision is not an easy one to make, but it is sometimes \nnecessary.\u0014\n Kristi Wilson / Bakersfield, Calif.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe abortion I had was significant because it wasnt. It didnt \ndisrupt my life. It didnt financially devastate me. I was surrounded \nby support. I had the right to choose and the accessibility afforded \nby a liberal state.\u0014\n Margaret Gilkerson / New Haven, Conn.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would have never met my wife if her mother decided to have an \nabortion instead of putting her up for adoption. Our three amazing \nchildren would not exist today if the abortion path was chosen. And \nthen their children would never happen. The ripple goes on forever.\u0014\n Carl Klaudt / Sioux Falls, S.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2019 I had an abortion. It was at the time the hardest thing I had \never gone through in my life, but it was also one of the best and \nmost selfless decisions Ive ever made. I do not regret it. After my \nabortion I was then able to apply to the medical program of my dreams \nI had been working so hard to qualify for.\u0014\n Hannah Rayburn / Houston\u0014\n\u0014\nI have never needed an abortion but had friends who almost died from \nbotched abortions. I never worried that my daughter would have to \nrisk her life if she needed an abortion. Nor did I worry that my son \nmight be indirectly responsible for a womans death. Now I am \nconcerned for both of them.\u0014\n Marigene Arnold / Kalamazoo, Mich.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I found out I was pregnant with my oldest, I was up to my head \nin college work and enjoying the single life. I set an appointment \nwith Planned Parenthood. When I arrived I was counseled by a \nwonderful woman beforehand who was very patient, nonjudgmental and \neducational. During my appointment I had changed my mind. My son is 8 \nand thriving. While I did not choose to have an abortion, it was \nincredible to have the resource available to me if I needed it.\u0014\n Ashlee Buckalew-Martindill / San Jacinto, Calif.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have never personally had an abortion but I have paid for my son's \ngirlfriend to have one. I was born in 1962  I remember when Roe was \nruled on. We cannot go back to back-alley abortions.\u0014\n Kelly Stefl / Cleveland, Ohio\u0014\n\u0014\nMy abortion in the early 1980s enabled me to begin my career as a \nregistered nurse, be self-supporting and time my childbearing for \nwhen I was married. I have never regretted it.\u0014\n Judith Gnau / Hollins, Va.\u0014\n\u0014\nI got pregnant when I was 15 in 1977. I was not prepared to be a \nmother. Fortunately my mother, who was not totally in favor of \nabortion, but knew I was not mature enough to be a mother, took me to \nMinneapolis for a safe abortion. I would not have the life I now have \nif I would have been forced to have a baby at that age.\u0014\n Connie Knuth / Janesville, Wisc.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven being in my 60s, my abortion remains the single greatest regret \nof my life, which has caused me immeasurable grief. Some years have \nbeen more difficult than others to weather the storm of emotions. For \nthe most part Ive found peace, however grief and regret lurk always \njust beneath the surface. Young and unable to recognize the enormity \nof my decision, I made a cavalier, impulsive choice. How I wish  oh, \nhow I wish  I had been unable to make that choice!\u0014\n Diane Marie / Naples, Fla.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn high school I had to counsel a fellow student who was pregnant. \nShe didnt want to tell her parents because of their religion. I \ndont think she knew her options at all. She ended up getting an \nabortion without her parents permission because this was legal and \nstill is in California.\u0014\n Eric Shepard / Carlsbad, Calif.\u0014\n\u0014\nA partner I was with decided to get an abortion after we found out \nabout an unplanned pregnancy. We were both young and both knew we \nwouldn't be staying together for long. I wanted to keep the baby; she \ndid not. I was devastated, but I supported her decision. I shielded \nher past protesters and waited until it was over, mourning what could \nhave been. But that experience only reaffirmed my belief that women \nshould have sole control over their health and bodies. People need to \nunderstand that just because I'm pro-choice, that doesn't make it any \nless painful.\u0014\n Ed C / Addison, Texas\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I am currently an LGBT college student, it is my hope one day \nto have a family. In the event that I adopt girls, I am incredibly \nscared for their safety, well-being and access to certain health care \nprocedures. I am very anxious about the government going after them \nif they had accidentally gotten pregnant and did not have the ability \nto keep or care for them.\u0014\n Jordan Turner / Columbus, Ohio\u0014\n\u0014\nI had an abortion in my early 30s. My birth control failed and I was \nin school and knew that I was in no position to raise a child. I have \nno regrets and was able to pursue a career that made me a productive \ncitizen. I had to travel three hours and stay overnight as the only \nmedical facility at the time was a Catholic hospital that didn't do \nabortions. While it was inconvenient to travel, I can't imagine not \nhaving that choice available to me.\u0014\n Jennifer Stenkamp / Redmond, Ore.\u0014\n\u0014\nI haven't had an abortion, but my mom did when she was young. It's \nodd to qualify life, but I know our family would not be here without \nthe right to abortion. There would be another broken kid from a \nbroken home, and another broken family in America.\u0014\n Cody Hickman / Arlington, Va.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis decision may well determine whether or not my fianc and I even \ntry to conceive. I am a 42-year-old woman with no children, about to \nbe married. Being as I'm \"old\" for pregnancy, there are a lot more \nrisks associated with a pregnancy, both for me and the baby. We both \nagree that we would not want to continue with a pregnancy that would \nresult in harm to me, or one that would end with a baby with severe \ndisabilities. Our reasons for this are both very personal as well as \nfinancial, but they are our decision, no one else's.\u0014\n Sarah Weston / Virginia Beach, Va.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot getting an abortion has been the best decision of my life. My \ndaughter is the most wonderful person I could have ever imagined. If \nwe had gone through with an abortion when we were young and scared I \nwould never have known the joy and gift of having this person in my \nlife.\u0014\n Douglas Coakley / Metropolis, Ill.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was married and in love with my husband. I was in a foreign \ncountry. I wasnt ready to be a mother. As a mom now, the decision to \nabort is one I have learned to live with. Its been difficult at \ntimes because its taboo to discuss openly. People judge and shun. \nEven friends turn away from you. Its lonely.\u0014\n J.B. / San Marcos, Calif.\u0014",

Some had proposed a day \nfor mothers; others had actually implemented local observances. \nHowever, the person whose tireless advocacy, fundraising, and letter \nwriting resulted in Wilsons national proclamation was Anna M. Jarvis.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnnas mother, Ann Reese Jarvis, died in 1905. For years she had \norganized womens groups as well as teaching Sunday school at St. \nAndrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia. \nGraftons Sunday school superintendent asked Anna to help him honor \nher mothers memory. The Grafton service was held on the second \nSunday of May, 1907, the anniversary of Ann Jarviss death. Although \nAnna could not attend, she sent a telegram that was read at the \nservice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seemed to Anna that children often failed to show their \nappreciation for their moms while the mothers were still alive. Why \nnot change that? Why not create a day of reflection and quiet prayer, \na day for thanking God for mothers and all that they do for us? Anna \npersuaded her own church in Philadelphia to hold a Mothers Day \nservice on this day, 10 May 1908. She supplied the church with white \ncarnations, her moms favorite flower. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter that, Anna wrote thousands of letters and gave countless \ninterviews to promote a national Mothers Day. She trademarked the \nname Mothers Day (with an apostrophe before the s to show that \neach individual mom was meant). Friends joined her effort. An \nevangelist, J. Wilbur Chapman, even used his revival meetings to \npromote the cause.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years later, Anna had her wish. Soon, however, the holiday was \ncommercialized. Anna hated this. She sued people for using Mothers \nDay in their advertising. Once she was arrested for protesting a \nwomens group that sold white carnations! She even tried to get the \ngovernment to ban the holiday she had worked so hard to create. She \nwent to her death embittered at what Mothers Day had become. Today, \nMothers Day is the day of the year that has the highest volume of \nphone calls and generates millions in the sale of cards and gifts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically ANNA HERSELF NEVER BECAME A MOTHER.  She had been tied up \ncaring for her blind sister, Elsinore. St. Andrews Methodist \nEpiscopal Church incorporated as a Mothers Day shrine in 1962.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to \nAustralia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this \nman's family was a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining \nthe circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding \nhis time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, \nworked at the local shipyards which bordered on the worse section of \ntown. Now I have a story to tell you that sounds like a fairy tale, \nbut its not. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWalking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by \nfive thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his \nmoney, the young fellow fought back. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey smashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body \nbrutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened \nto find him lying in the road they assumed he was dead and called for \nthe mortuary. On the way to the morgue, a policeman heard him gasp \nfor air, and they immediately took him to the emergency room at the \nlocal hospital. When he was placed on a gurney, a nurse remarked to \nher horror that this young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket \nwas smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally \nhanging from his face, all his teeth were gone, and his jaw was \nalmost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared, \nhe spent over a year in the hospital, as they desperately tried to \nsave him. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen he finally left, his body may have healed, but his face was \ndisgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that \neveryone admired. When the young man started to look for work again \nhe was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. \nOne potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show \nat the circus as The Man Who Had No Face. And he did this for a \nwhile. He was still rejected by everyone, and no one wanted to be \nseen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for \nfive years. One day he passed a church and sought some comfort there. \nEntering the church he encountered a priest who had seen him sobbing \nwhile kneeling in a pew.\u0014\n\u0014\n \tThe priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they \ntalked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree \nthat he said that he would do everything possible that could be done \nfor him to restore his dignity and his life. The young man promised \nhe would be the best believer he could be, and trust in God's mercy \nto free him from his torturous life. He became a part of that \nfellowship of faith, and after thanking God for saving his life, \nasked God to give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man \nhe could be. The priest, through his personal contacts was able to \nsecure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. There \nwould be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's \nbest friend. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe doctor too was deeply impressed by the young man. The surgery \nwas a remarkable success. The best dental work was done for him. And \nthe young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was \nblessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and \nsuccess in an industry that would have been the furthest thing from \nhis mind, if not for the goodness of God and the supporting love of \nGods people who supported him and cared for him when no one else \ndid. This he acknowledges publicly to this day. Oh, I forgot to tell \nyou his name. The young man was Mel Gibson. I guess youve heard of \nhim. His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie \nThe Man Without A Face. Mel Gibson illustrates what staying close \nto the fellowship of believers can mean to a persons faith and his \nlife. Stay close to Gods people.\u0014",

    "title": "SAM SHARPE, EXECUTED FOR SLAVE REVOLT",
    "words": "SAM SHARPE EXECUTED FOR MASTER-MINDING A SLAVE REVOLT\u0014\n \u0014\nWhat began as a peaceful demonstration became the biggest slave \nrevolt in Jamaicas history. The uprising is known as The Baptist War \nor Sam Sharpes Rebellion. Sam Sharpe was a Baptist deacon and slave \nwho fostered a hunger for freedom while preaching in Baptist churches \nand speaking at non-church gatherings.\u0014\n\u0014\nJamaicas enslaved Baptists interpreted biblical promises of \nspiritual freedom to include the promise of physical liberty. They \ntook Pauls declaration that in Christ there is neither slave nor \nfree, to mean that in Christ all are equal. They read Jesuss \nassertion that no man can serve two masters as meaning one could \nnot serve both Christ and an earthly massa. They understood If the \nson of man makes you free, you shall be free indeed, to mean that a \nfollower of Christ was intended to be a free person.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, across the ocean a handful of British lawmakers wrestled \nto abolish slavery. Rumors reached Jamaica that Parliament had \nalready done so. Blacks believed their local masters were holding \nthem in slavery against the law. They became even more restive.\u0014\n\u0014\nSharpe, who was well-read, masterminded a plan for passive resistance \nto follow the Christmas holiday in 1831. At that season, because cane \nharvesters were most urgently needed, he thought that a general \nstrike would force plantation owners to negotiate better conditions \nfor their workers. However civil disobedience went up in smoke when \nhotheads set fire to the Kensington Estate in St. James Parish. \nWithin hours, looting and burning spread to neighboring estates. \u0014\n\u0014\nJamaicas militias did not fare well in the skirmishes that followed. \nThe rebels killed a few Whites and drove back others. The rebels \nbelieved British troops would side with them. They soon recognized \ntheir miscalculation when the soldiers marched against them with \ncannons. Within two weeks, the rebellion was crushed. \u0014\n\u0014\nReprisals were only beginning, however. Triumphant slaveholders \nwhipped and slaughtered captured rebels. They tried and hanged many \nmore. Five hundred or more rebels paid with their lives, most of them \nafter the cessation of the fighting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities blamed Baptists and Moravians for the uprising and \narrested several missionaries. To save their lives, Sam Sharpe gave \nhimself up and took blame for the insurrection. Nevertheless, he \ninsisted that he had only called for civil disobedience, not \nviolence, and had believed the rumors that King William had liberated \nthe slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll this was reckoned no defense. On 19 April 1832 he received the \nanticipated sentence: \u0014\n\u0014\nThat the said Negro Man Slave named Samuel Sharpe be taken from hence \nto the place from whence he came and from thence to the place of \nExecution at such time and place as shall be appointed by His \nExcellency the Governor and there to be hanged by the neck until he \nbe dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nSentence was carried out on this day, 23 May 1832, in Montego Bay. \nSpeaking to a large crowd at the scaffold, Sharpe said, I would \nrather die upon yonder gallows than live in slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities released the missionaries. In 1833, Parliament finally \nvoted to free all those held in slavery in British territories. Sam \nSharpes Rebellion helped force the issue. It highlighted the truth \nof the abolitionists arguments that slavery was cruel and costly. \nParliament granted liberation to Jamaicans in the form of \napprenticeships in 1834. Not until 1938, however, was emancipation \ncomplete. \u0014\n\u0014\nSharpes noble pursuit of liberty gained admiration as years passed. \nAnd in the last quarter of the twentieth century, Jamaica enrolled \nhim among its heroes.\u0014",

    "title": "STEPMOTHER -- REVIEW BY BOB CORNWALL",
    "words": "STEPMOTHER: Redeeming a Disdained Vocation. By Dorothy C. Bass. \nMinneapolis: Broadleaf Books, 2022. \u0014\nReview by Robert D. Cornwall\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a stepparent is not easy. Ive been a stepchild, but that is \nnot the same thing, especially since I was already a junior in high \nschool when my mother remarried after my parents divorce. So, I \ncant really speak to this from personal experience, other than \nobserving how others have experienced life as a stepparent. I can \nimagine that stepmothers, could have it harder than stepfathers. \nPerhaps thats because mothers have traditionally been the family \ncaregivers. So how does a stepmother fit in? It doesnt help the \nsituation that traditionally stepmothers are seen as being evil \nbeings. Think about the stepmothers in Cinderella or Snow White. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the traditional depiction of stepmothers, family dynamics \nhave been changing for some time and stepparenting is also on the \nincrease. The reasons behind these change dynamics are complicated. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas once upon a time couples stayed together for worse as well as \nbetter. Now, couples no longer consider staying together when life \ntogether is unworkable at best. So, divorces happen along with \nremarriage. Of course, its not just divorce that leads to second \nmarriages. The death of a spouse can also contribute to reconfigured \nfamilies (consider President and Dr. Biden, who married after Joes \nwife died in a car accident, making Jill stepmother to his surviving \nchildren).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to the vocation of being a stepmother, Dorothy C. Bass, \noffers a response to the traditional picture of the evil stepmother. \nShe seeks to redeem this disdained vocation by offering her own \nlife experience as a word of grace and encouragement to those who \nfind themselves serving as stepmothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author of Stepmother, Dorothy Bass, is a well-known writer, \nchurch historian, and teacher of practical theology. She was ordained \nin the United Church of Christ and served for twenty-five years as \ndirector of the Valparaiso Project on the Education and Formation of \nPeople in Faith. For the purposes of this review, Dorothy Bass is a \nstepparent. That means she knows something about the topic at hand. \nWhile she acknowledges that every story is different, she also notes \nthat those who find themselves in this form of family life yearn for \nreliable companions, when experiencing the challenges of forming \nfamily relationships in this context.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we walk with Bass through this story, we discover that Bass knows \nboth the joys and the heartaches that come with the territory. For \nher part, she became a stepparent while in her 30s, having \nexperienced an earlier divorce. She would marry a divorced man who \nhad a young daughter from his first marriage. Eventually, the couple \nwould have children of their own, but this book isnt about them \n(though they do figure into the story). This is primarily a book \nabout Basss relationship with her stepdaughter and her \nstepdaughters mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a very personal book because Bass speaks of her own desires \nand feelings. She shares how others perceived her relationship with \nher stepdaughter, including the question of identity. While she \nquickly came to love her stepdaughter Kristen (she has chosen not to \nuse her stepdaughters real name in this account and the same is true \nfor Kristens mother, who is known here as Bekka), she also \ndiscovered that there were questions about the nature of her role. \nWhat does it mean to be a stepmother, especially because the word \nstepmother is often the ugly word? The term suggests a secondary \nstatus in a relationship. No matter how close stepmother and \nstepchild might be there is still this sense of ultimately being an \noutsider to the relationship. After all, shes not Kristens mother, \neven though when the two are together she performs parental duties. \nThere is the question of where home is? Is Kristens home with her \nfather and stepmother or with her mother and stepfather? In this \ncase, the families chose to embrace Kristens house as home. These \nare important issues because the adults in the relationship need to \nmake sure they dont confuse the child. When it comes to these \nquestions, it needs to be recognized that children will be called \nupon to make adjustments in their lives, even as the parents must as \nwell. Nevertheless, there are times when feelings get hurt and when \njealousy makes an appearance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBass walks us through her life with Kristen and Kristens mother (as \nwell as with her husband). The penultimate chapter is an important \none because it speaks of Mercy. The fact that one becomes a \nstepparent means that there is some form of brokenness in the \nsituation. It might be the death of a spouse leading to remarriage or \nit might be divorce. Whatever is the case, it is good when mercy \nenters the picture. So, Bass writes that when we listen carefully, \nits just possible that well detect small notes of love breaking \nthrough the ambient noise of our messy relationships. These notes are \nworth noticing (p. 169). So, when this happens, then theres the \npossibility of finding healing, hope, and friendship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe final chapter is titled Vocation. Questions of vocation/calling \nare rooted in identity. While some might question Basss use of the \nterm vocation, it does seem to be fitting. One would assume that no \none grows up expecting to be a stepparent. Its not at the top of the \nlist of life callings, and yet many are finding themselves in this \nrole. So, is it not a vocation? For Dorothy Bass, she sees her role \nas stepmother being a vocation, a calling. She writes that being a \nstepmother is not a role into which I was cast after turning out for \nauditions. It is a vocation into which I was called. It is a place of \nresponsibility, located within a family and the larger society, where \nI am positioned to contribute to the well-being of others (p. 185). \nUltimately, it is a vocation of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nI read Dorothy Basss Stepmother as an outsider to the situation. As \nI noted above, Im not a stepparent, though Ive experienced being a \nstepchild. That is, of course, a different story than this one. \nHopefully, those who find themselves in this vocation, will find a \nword of encouragement and even healing. As a result, I hope that with \nthis book a disdained vocation can be redeemed. No longer will \nstepmother be considered an ugly word. While Bass writes first of \nall to and for stepmothers, I hope others, like me who are clergy \nwill read and consider the message. By gaining a deeper understanding \nof the complexity of these kinds of relationships, we who find \nourselves in relationships with stepmothers (and stepfathers, though \nthat might be a different book), can gain an understanding of family \ndynamics that will allow us to be of greater support. Whatever ones \nfamily situation, this book offers a valuable and very personal word.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert D. Cornwall is an ordained minister in the Christian Church \n(Disciples of Christ).\u0014",

    "words": "SEVEN BOLD BISHOPS SAID \"NO\" TO THEIR KING'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTION\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1687, King James II of England issued a Declaration of Indulgence. \nThis removed restrictions against the free exercise of religion for \nCatholics and nonconformists (e.g. Baptists and Puritans). A Roman \nCatholic, James had promised to uphold the Church of England and \nnever to attempt to reinstitute Catholicism. But he began violating \nhis oath within days of ascending the throne. He was notorious for \nattempts to install Catholics as heads of universities and to stack \nParliament with his supporters by changing local electorates.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the surface of it, the declaration was a good thing and much \nneeded. Among the acts noble sentiments were words such as:\u0014\n\"conscience ought not to be constrained nor people forced in matters \nof mere religion. . . . For after all the frequent and pressing \nendeavours that were used in each of [the last four reigns] to reduce \nthis kingdom to an exact conformity in religion, it is visible the \nsuccess has not answered the design, and that the difficulty is \ninvincible. . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nWe therefore . . . have thought fit by virtue of our royal \nprerogative to issue forth this our declaration of indulgence, making \nno doubt of the concurrence of our two Houses of Parliament when we \nshall think it convenient for them to meet.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJamess declaration scarcely made a splash, so he reissued it in 1688 \nand ordered Church of England bishops to have their clergy read it in \nall churches on two consecutive Sundays. This was a serious matter. \nTo agree would undermine the English constitution by violating laws \nestablished by Parliament on the say-so of the king. The Archbishop \nof Canterbury conferred with neighboring bishops. They delivered a \nrespectful petition to the king, asking to be exempted from his order.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames was furious. He accused them of rebellion. In vain the bishops \nprotested that oaths they had taken before God must outweigh their \npersonal loyalty to him. They could not sway James. After most of \nEnglands clergy refused to read the declaration to their \nparishioners (only 200 of about 10,000 did), James decided to break \nthe bishops by legal action. He charged them with seditious libel \nbecause their petition was distributed throughout England (although \nwithout their permission).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe kings council summoned the bishops to appear before them on this \nday, 8 June 1688. William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, William \nLloyd of St. Asaph, Francis Turner of Ely, John Lake of Chichester, \nThomas Ken of Bath and Wells, Thomas White of Peterborough, and \nJonathan Trelawny of Bristol refused to put up recognisance (a \nbail-like deposit) because they were exempt by law. The king ordered \nthem taken to the Tower of London. By now the nation realized the \nissues at stake and rooted for the bishops. When a boat transferred \nthe seven to the tower, spectators lined the shore of the Thames \nRiver and the water was thick with the crafts of well-wishers. Even \nnonconformists, who would have benefited from the declaration (having \nsuffered much from the Church of England), aligned themselves with \nthe bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trial took place on 29 June. The outcome was by no means certain \nbecause the jury pool was selected from Londoners thought to be \nsafe for the king. After debating all night, the jury found the \nseven bishops not guilty. The verdict was a blow to James. His \nexecutive tyranny was checked. The nation went wild with joy. \nBonfires illuminated London and surrounding cities all night. \u0014\n\u0014\nJamess opponents saw his unpopularity as their opportunity to \nsupplant him. Fearing more high-handed actions, and afraid that \nJamess newly-born son and royal heir James Francis Edward Stuart \nwould rule as a Catholic, several nobles secretly invited James IIs \ndaughter Mary and her Dutch husband William to the throne. Then the \nbishops showed their true character. Despite what they had suffered \nat Jamess hand, after he fled and William and Mary came over, five \nrefused to perjure themselves by swearing allegiance to the new king. \nThey forfeited their church positions as a consequence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Supreme Rule for Christian Nationalism\u0014\n\u0014\nBrian Kaylor and Beau Underwood  Jun 23, 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe this notion of the separation of church and state was the \nfigment of some infidels imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith that declaration, the pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, \nTexas, defended his partisan campaigning for Ronald Reagan in 1984. \nIn his sermon on the eve of the Republican National Convention in \nDallas, W.A. Criswell, who was also a former president of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention, implicitly endorsed Reagans reelection. \nFrom the pulpit, Criswell praised Reagan as the best president we \never had. Then a few days later Criswell offered the benediction at \nthe Republican gathering on the night Reagan gave his acceptance \naddress for his renomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nCBS Evening News asked Criswell how he justified his politicking from \nthe pulpit of First Baptist and the podium of the RNC in light of the \nseparation of church and state. Thats when he blamed an unnamed \ninfidel for the concept. Were not sure which one. Perhaps he meant \nThomas Jefferson (who did cut up his New Testament), but the author \nof the Declaration of Independence borrowed that concept of \nchurch-state separation from Baptists like Roger Williams, John \nLeland, and Thomas Helwys. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as Criswell played a significant role in the movement that was \nat that moment pushing the nations largest Protestant denomination \nrightward and into more active partisan politics, he needed to \nexcommunicate those historic Baptist figures. After all, the \nconstitutional principle that most stands in the way of the agenda of \nChristian Nationalism is the idea of church-state separation, \nespecially as articulated in the First Amendment clause barring \ngovernment establishment of religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the phrase separation of church and state isnt in the \nConstitution, someone might interject. And by someone we mean lots of \ncritics of the idea today. Its a true comment but not a clever one. \nThat exact phrase cannot be found in the Constitution, but that \ndoesnt mean its not a constitutional principle. You also wont find \nthe phrase religious liberty in the document either, but its \nclearly a constitutional precept. Similarly, you wont find the word \ntrinity in the Bible, but that doesnt mean its not a biblical \ndoctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the impact of church-state separation on our society, \ntheres been a significant political effort to chip away at the wall \nbetween the two. The perspective of Criswell appears to be gaining \ntraction not only within his denomination, but also with Christians \nmore broadly and even with justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Tuesday (June 21), the latest shot came as six justices ruled in \nCarson v. Makin to push state funding of private religious schools. \nAs we consider the problematic ruling and how it shifts First \nAmendment jurisprudence, we should also revisit the case that seems \nto most energize the effort to undo church-state separation. After \nall, the 60th anniversary of the Courts landmark decision on \ngovernment prayers in public school will be this Saturday (June 25). \nSix decades later, the high court has moved substantially toward the \nperspective of Christian Nationalism (with one justice even \ndismissing the so-called separation of church and state).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this issue of A Public Witness, we travel back to 1962 to consider \nthe Courts case on prayer in public schools (including how Word&Way \nand other Christians praised the ruling at the time). Then we return \nto the present to analyze the arguments in Carson v. Makin before \npeering into the future to consider where this dangerous trip might \nbe taking us as a nation.\u0014",

Mr. Naylor survived \nthe war but died while Lelia was still a young girl. She learned at \nan early age to work hard and practiced piano at a neighbors home. \nEven then she sang often during the day. Soon the songs she sang were \nsongs of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was ten years old I was led to give my heart to God, she \nsaid. I knew then that I needed a Savior. Three different years I \nwent forward to the altar and prayed and prayed, until a man came and \nlaid his hand on my head and said Why, little girl, God is here and \nready to forgive your sins. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the age of twelve she was playing organ for Wednesday prayer \nmeetings at the Methodist Protestant Church. Times were often hard \nafter the death of her father, and so she became a helper in her \nmothers hat shop by sewing and tailoring. She was nineteen when she \nmarried Charles Morris, the son of a wealthy family, and became a \nmemberand the organistof the Methodist Episcopal Church that he \nattended. They would have four children, two girls and two boys. \nTheir home became a hub for the children of McConnelsville, who used \nits well-stocked library while preparing their homework. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1892, when Lelia was thirty, her Christian life took a deeper \nturn. At a camp meeting, she heard of a second work of grace, \navailable to any Christian, that cleanses the heart and fills the \nchild of God with the Holy Spirit so that he or she has new power: \u0014\n\u0014\nI read in books about the Holy Spirit and how that we might have the \nHoly Spirit come into our lives. I had read this over and over again, \nbut thought it was for bishops and preachers and those doing great \nwork for God. I did not suppose it was for me. Only did I find out in \nthe preaching that it was for the young, such as I. I was so glad \nwhen I found that I might have the Holy Spirit in my life. So I \nopened my heart and let the Holy Spirit come in.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost immediately afterward, she composed the first of many hymns. \nHer choir director and others encouraged her to have a few published. \nHenry Gilmour, who wrote and published hymns himself, was impressed \nand saw to it that hers got printed. She would write over a thousand, \nincluding both words and musicall published under the name C.H. \nMorris. Some remain well-known, among them Sweeter as the Years Go \nby and Let Jesus Come into Your Heart. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer holiness songs were favorites in camp meetings. When the topic \nwas the Second Coming of Christ, the song evangelist might turn to \nWhat if it Were Today?\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus is coming to earth again; what if it were today?\u0014\nComing in power and love to reign; what if it were today?\u0014\nComing to claim His chosen Bride, all the redeemed and purified,\u0014\nOver this whole earth scattered wide; what if it were today?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her old age she became blind but continued to write songs. Often \nshe had to hold both words and tunes in her memory until her daughter \nFanny visited and could write them down. She complained so little \nabout her blindness that friends forgot she could not see. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of her hymn-writing, she was often invited to sit on church \nplatforms.

    "title": "SAVONAROLA RAGED AGAINST CORRUPTION & LOST HIS LIFE",
    "words": "Savonarola Raged Against Corruption at the Cost of His Life\u0014\n \u0014\nWHEN Girolamo Savonarola was born in Ferrera, the moral landscape of \nItaly was as deplorable as it had been since the triumph of \nChristianity under Constantine. A series of degenerate popes set the \ntone by indulging in wastefulness, greed, murder, blasphemy, \nastrology, and sexual immorality. Princes and common folk followed \nsuit. \u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola would become one of the greatest men of his age because he \npushed back against those prevailing vices. As a boy, he was serious \nbut reclusive, eager to learn, sharp and skilled in debate but known \nfor gentleness in his dealings with others. His parents designated \nhim to become a doctor, and he entered his studies with enthusiasm, \nalthough he was more eager to master the philosophies of Plato and \nAristotle than medicine. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, the morose disposition for which he became known \ngrew more pronounced. Horrified by the decadence around him, at \ntwenty he wrote a poem titled The Ruin of the World. His \nunhappiness deepened when a girl he admired rejected him. When he was \ntwenty-two, Savonarola heard a sermon that caused him to burn \neverything he had written on Plato. The tinsel of the rich and the \nenslavement of the poor caused him to quote lines from a play many \ntimes a day: Ah! flee from this cruel land, flee from this covetous \nshore! He prayed continually that Christ would deliver him from \nthese prevailing sins and that God would lead him into the work he \nwas to do. \u0014\n\u0014\nDedicating himself completely to Christ, he resolved to become a \nmonk. In order that his departure would not be detected, for he loved \nhis parents and feared they would talk him out of his resolution, he \nleft home during the citys gaudy festival in honor of St. George, \nheld on April 24th that year. In his hand, he carried the family \nBible. This day 25 April, 1475 found him in Bologna, where he asked \nfor admittance to the Dominican order. \u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola became a monk, studied in Bologna, and then transferred to \nSt. Marks in Florence. At first he preached messages that only the \nscholarly could understand, but gradually he developed a style that \nappealed to the masses. He uttered dark prophecies against Italy and \nearned the implacable hatred of Pope Alexander VI when he denounced \nhis corruption and called upon Europes leaders to dethrone him. Huge \naudiences surged into his chapel. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn time Savonarola helped establish a republic in Florence. \nSurrounded by Dominicans who bullied the citizens, Savonarola and his \nfollowers burned the vanities of the cityart works and books. \nSavonarola had once remarked, It would be good for religion if many \nbooks that seem useful were destroyed. When there were not so many \nbooks and not so many arguments and disputes, religion grew more \nquickly than it has since. His followers would not even allow people \nto keep portraits of the deceased whom they had loved. \u0014\nPoor policies led to shortages in Florence and the city ran out of \nmoney. Pope Alexander VI threatened an interdict. Some of \nSavonarolas predictions failed. A Franciscan challenged Savonarola \nto an ordeal by fire and Domenico da Pescia accepted in Savonarolas \nbehalf. \u0014\n\u0014\nCrowds gathered, but the Franciscan backed out. Cheated of their \nspectacle, the people blamed Savonarola. The next day he was \narrested. For two months he was interrogated and tortured. Finally on \n23 May, 1498, he was hanged and burned. \u0014\nA curious event occurred at his execution. Scoffers had taunted him \nto work a miracle if he could. After he was dead, his hand flew up, \ntwo fingers extended, as if blessing the crowd.

    "words": "ACCORDING TO ONE of Daniel Marshalls friends, historian Morgan \nEdwards, Marshall was a weak man, a stammerer, and no scholar...a \nman of no bright parts, nor eloquence nor learning. Piety, \nearnestness and honesty are all he can boast of. Marshalls \nbrother-in-law Shubal Stearns was a short man with little education. \nNonetheless, their zeal was so great that a thousand Baptists \nchurches in the southern United States look back to them as founding \nfathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth men were from New EnglandMarshall from Connecticut and Stearns \nfrom Massachusettsand both had been profoundly influenced by the \nministry of George Whitefield. Although neither knew the other to \nbegin with, their zeal to convert others drew their paths together. \nFinding the established Congregational churches lifeless, they became \nSeparates and eventually Baptists. Both were evangelists and \npastors when they met in Virginia. They attempted to found a church \nat Cacapon Creek, Virginia, without much success. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1755 the two headed southward with their families. They settled \nnear Greensboro, North Carolina. On this day 22 November 1755 Shubal \nStearns, Daniel Marshall, and fourteen others founded the Sandy Creek \nBaptist Church in North Carolina. Although they were ridiculed \nbecause of the trembling and screams of those who heard them preach, \nthe church soon had six hundred members. From the very start, even \nwhile their own numbers were small, they spread the gospel into the \nsurrounding region, and several other Baptist churches sprang up. \nWithin three years, they formed those churches into an association. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarshall moved to South Carolina, where he planted more Separate \nBaptist churches and then moved on to Georgia where he continued to \nplant churches even when he was old and infirm. Baptists of the day \nwere persecuted and Marshall certainly received the brunt of it. \nArrested in Georgia and told never to preach again, he simply replied \nthat he must obey God, not man. Three of those involved in his arrest \nbecame converts. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarshalls last words were, My breath is almost gone. I have been \npraying that I may go home to-night. I had great happiness in our \nworship this morning; particularly in singing, which will make a part \nof my exercises in a blessed eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nStearns remained at Sandy Creek. In 1771, its congregation plunged to \njust fifteen people. Many of the democratically-inclined Separates \nhad joined a rebellion (the War of Regulation). When it was crushed, \nthey fled west. They founded new churches wherever they settled, so \nthat by Stearnss death that year, there were forty-two Separate \nBaptist churches. Sandy Creek had sent out one hundred and \ntwenty-five ministers. Many Separate churches were eventually \nassimilated by other Baptist denominations.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\n       It is gratitude that prompted an old man to visit an old \nbroken pier on the eastern seacoast of Florida.\u0014\n       Every Friday night, until his death in 1973, he would return, \nwalking slowly and slightly stooped with a\u0014\n       large bucket of shrimp. The sea gulls would flock to this old \nman, and he would feed them from his\u0014\n       bucket. Many years before, in October, 1942, Captain Eddie \nRickenbacker was on a mission in a B-17\u0014\n       to deliver an important message to General Douglas MacArthur \nin New Guinea.But there was an\u0014\n       unexpected detour which would hurl Captain Eddie into the most \nharrowing adventure of his life.\u0014\n       Somewhere over the South Pacific the Flying Fortress became \nlost beyond the reach of radio. Fuel             ran dangerously low, \nso the men ditched their plane in the ocean...\u0014\n\u0014\n       For nearly a month Captain Eddie and his companions would \nfight the water, and the weather, and the\u0014\n       scorching sun. They spent many sleepless nights recoiling as \ngiant sharks rammed their rafts. The              largest raft was \nnine by five. The biggest shark...ten feet long. \u0014\n\u0014\n       But of all their enemies at sea, one proved most formidable: \nstarvation. Eight days out, their rations             were\u0014\n       long gone or destroyed by the salt water. It would take a \nmiracle to sustain them. And a miracle\u0014\n       occurred. In Captain Eddie's own words, \"Cherry,\" that was the \nB-17 pilot, Captain William Cherry,\u0014\n       \"read the service that afternoon, and we finished with a \nprayer for deliverance and a hymn of praise.\u0014\n       There was some talk, but it tapered off in the oppressive \nheat. With my hat pulled down over my eyes         to keep out some \nof the glare, I dozed off.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       Now this is still Captain Rickenbacker talking...\"Something \nlanded on my head. I knew that it was a              sea\u0014\n       gull. I don't know how I knew, I just knew. Everyone else knew \ntoo. No one said a word, but peering\u0014\n       out from under my hat brim without moving my head, I could see \nthe expression on their faces. They\u0014\n       were staring at that gull. The gull meant food...if I could \ncatch it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       And the rest, as they say, is history. Captain Eddie caught \nthe gull. Its flesh was eaten. Its intestines            were\u0014\n       used for bait to catch fish. The survivors were sustained and \ntheir hopes renewed because a lone sea        gull,\u0014\n       uncharacteristically hundreds of miles from land, offered \nitself as a sacrifice. You know that Captain\u0014\n       Eddie made it.And now you also know...that he never forgot. \nBecause every Friday evening, about\u0014\n       sunset...on a lonely stretch along the eastern Florida \nseacoast...you could see an old man\u0014\n       walking...white-haired, bushy-eyebrowed, slightly bent. His \nbucket filled with shrimp was to feed the\u0014\n       gulls...to remember that one which, on a day long past, gave \nitself without a struggle...like manna in            the wilderness.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Paul Harvey, The Rest of the Story, 1977.\u0014",

    "title": "SOCIETY OF JESUS (JESUITS) SERVED POPES",
    "words": "DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) spread \nthroughout Europe. Founded in 1540, the order vowed to do the bidding \nof popes. It became famous for its far-flung missions and its \ninnovative educational methods. On the good side, Jesuits founded \nhundreds of schools and protected the rights of indigenous people in \nLatin America. But many Jesuits also subverted governments and \nincited persecution of Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome universities, cities, and states resisted the society. They \ncomplained about it to parliaments, kings, and popes. In 1565, an \nAustrian assembly demanded its banishment from Germany and Hungary. \nAntwerp expelled the society in 1578 because it refused to abide by a \ntreaty. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Jesuits plotted to assassinate her, Elizabeth I of England \nissued an order against them in 1591. In 1597, Henry IV of France \nrestricted them because they tried to take his life and to undermine \npeace with Protestants. Elizabeths successor, James I, laid out a \ndetailed case against the society in 1604. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1603, the Parliament of Paris noted that Jesuits were \ntroublemakers. When the King of Spain usurped the government of \nPortugal, all the Religious Orders adhered firmly to their King, the \nJesuits excepted, who deserted him, and were the cause of two \nthousand deaths, for which they obtained a special Bull of \nAbsolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe uneasy relationship between Jesuits and Catholic nations \ncontinued into the following century. Portugal expelled the Jesuits \nin 1759 and France in 1764. On this day, 2 April 1767, authorities \nthroughout Spain opened sealed copies of a letter from their \nsovereign, Charles III. The next morning, they arrested six thousand \nJesuits, loaded them on ships, and sent them to Italy. Charles had \ngrown alarmed at Jesuit wealth and power. He may have believed they \nwere preparing to overthrow his government. He also expelled the \nsociety from his South American territories and from Naples.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Jesuits had always returned after banishment, European \nleaders demanded a permanent solution. Pope Clement XIV abolished the \nsociety in 1773. Jesuits went undercover or took refuge in Prussia \nand in Russia. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Pius VII restored the society in 1814. He needed help against \nNapoleon who had humiliated and imprisoned him. The restored Jesuits \nlobbied for the 1870 decree of papal infallibility. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the twentieth century, many Jesuits incorporated secular humanism \nor Marxism into their theologies.  They ignored or defied popes who \nresisted the trend. They butted heads with John Paul II who opposed \ncommunism. Yet in 2013 an Argentine Jesuit, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, \nbecame Pope Francis I. The society had come a long way since its \nsuppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

If you like, you can say the \nlaws are the work of God, but that is more a definition of God than a \nproof of his existence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering the possibility of God existing, he went on to write: \"We \nare each free to believe what we want and its my view that the \nsimplest explanation is there is no God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads \nme to a profound realization, theres probably no Heaven and no \nafterlife, either.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe \nand for that I am extremely grateful.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking in 2014, four years before his death, Hawking had a stark \nwarning to humanity before his death about the capabilities and \nthreat of artificial intelligence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a BBC interview, Hawking warned: The development of full \nartificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the technology was only just beginning to emerge, Hawking had \nthe foresight to theorise how it might develop and impact our lives, \nespecially if it exceeds human intelligence.\u0014",

His was so full of \nparadoxes [but]... we cannot fail to be awed by the vastness of his \naspirations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man they loved to hate\u0014\nRaleigh had good looks, a charming personality, and enough money to \ncut a dashing, even opulent figure, at the court of Elizabeth I. He \nalso possessed the type of personality that provoked strong reactions \nfrom the people around him. The Earl of Essex never missed a chance \nto blacken Raleighs name and challenged him to a duel with him. \nQueen Elizabeth loved him, hated him, then loved him again. King \nJames I thought Raleigh such a scoundrel he locked him away in the \nTower of London. James wife, Queen Anne, on the other hand, was so \ncharmed by Raleigh she visited him often in prison and lobbied her \nhusband (unsuccessfully) to release him. When James had Raleigh \nbeheaded, the King of Spain sat down and wrote James a thank-you note \nfor executing the man who had sacked so many Spanish ports and \ncaptured so many Spanish treasure ships.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaleigh in the shark pool\u0014\nTrevelyan describes Elizabethan politics as a shark pool in which \nRaleigh was just one of many men and women who were jockeying for \nposition, privileges, power, and money. Perhaps the greatness of \nRaleighs ambition was the reason he attracted so much animosity. It \nwas, after all, Raleigh who came up with the idea of establishing an \nEnglish colony in the New World. And it was Raleigh who set out in \nsearch of the gold of El Dorado. True, that quest strikes us as \nalmost silly, but given the river of gold and silver Cortes found in \nMexico and Pizarro found in Peru, Raleighs expedition was a \nreasonable gamble.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything interested Sir Walter Raleigh. He was a stellar poet, an \nintrepid explorer, a ship designer, a military and naval strategist, \na chemist, he even took in an interest in the uses of new-found \nplants: it was Raleigh who introduced the potato to Ireland.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrevelyan doesnt gloss over his ancestors failings: Raleigh could \nbe bloody, arrogant, even cowardly. Still, it is impossible not be \nawed by a man who strived so hard for greatness. 640 PAGES & 6\" x 9\" \n& 2 8-page B&W inserts\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: Raleigh Trevelyan, a direct descendant of Sir \nWalter Raleigh, is the author of 12 books, including Grand Dukes and \nDiamonds and The Shadow of Vesuvius.\u0014",

    "words": "March 2, 2004\u0014\n \u0014\nIn a recent report from George Barna we learn that less than half of \nBaby Buster (ages 20-38) pastors (46%) currently have a seminary \ndegree, compared to two-thirds of Boomer pastors (62%). \u0014\n\u0014\nBarna says that, \"Part of this gap stems from the fact that some \npastors obtain their seminary degree later in life.\" Yet it also is \nthe case that, \"many young pastors are avoiding seminary due to their \ngrowing skepticism about its necessity and relevance to their \nministry. Past studies have also shown that a growing number of large \nchurches are training congregants for full-time ministry from within, \nrather than sending people off-campus for more traditional academic \ntraining for ministry. Many of those church-trained leaders \napprentice within the mother church, then are sent off-campus to \nplant a church. By staying within the nurturing framework and support \nsystem of the mother church, the nascent leader has no compelling \nreason to attend a seminary.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTherein lies good news and bad news. The good news is that pastors \ntrained within a local church setting should receive a wealth of \npractical insights about leadership and ministry. The bad news: \nthey'll have lots of practical skills without the depth of knowledge \nthat comes from the study of theology, church history, biblical \nlanguages and so on. The result could be churches that are a \ngeneration away from being disconnected from their biblical and \ntheological heritage, and susceptible to all sorts of aberrant or \neven heretical teachings.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow more than ever it is important for seminaries and local churches \nto find ways to partner in the preparation of future ministers. The \njob is too important for either one to do alone.\u0014\nMichael Duduit\u0014",

    "title": "SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE",
    "words": "\"Religious liberty is the nursinig  mother ot all liberty. Without it \nall other forms oI liberty must soon wither and die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge W. Truett, then pastor of First Baptist Church, Dallas, and \npresident of the Baptist World Alliance, preached these words in \nAtlanta, Georgia, at the 1939 BWA meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery person should memorize and treasure these words, along with the \nwords to the First Amendment. They concisely explain \"What makes \nAmerica, America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Why is America the most Christian nation in the world?\u0014\n    Why is America the freest nation in the world?\u0014\n    Why is America the most prosperous nation in history?\u0014\n    Why is America the most open society in the world?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's because of the First Amendment that begins: \"Congress shall make \nno law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNo nation had ever given such freedom to its citizens. Every previous \nnation had in some way combined the power of the church with the rule \nof the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did our American founders come to such a radical idea? They based \ntheir decision on the lessons of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jefferson wrote in 1813, \"History, I believe, furnishes no \nexample of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil  \ngovernment. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their \ncivil as well as religious leaders will always avail theniselves for \ntheir own purposes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1814 Jefferson wrote: \"In every country and in every age, the \npriest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the \ndespot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson, James Madison, and other founding fathers knew well the \nabuses that always occurred when civil and religious power were \njoined together. History was a clear record, including horrible \nabuses such as the Crusades and the Inquisition.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the Reformation failed to embrace religious liberty. The city \ncoucil of Zurich, Switzerland, free from Catholic control and \nembracing the Swiss reformation, voted in 1527 that \"believer's \nbaptism was punishable by death.\" Thus, they executed many more \nradical reformers, called Anabaptists, who insisted that the \ngovernment should have no power over the church and vice versa and \nthat baptism was for adult believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of religious freedom would surface again in England in 1612, \nwhen an early Baptist, Thomas Helwys, wrote, \"The King is a mortal \nman and not God and therefore has no power over the immortal souls of \nhis subjects men's religion to God is betwixt God arid themselves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHeIwys was iniprisoned for such writings and died in prison in 1616.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's true that many who came to America came to avoid persecution in \nEngland. What is often not acknowledged is that these same persons, \nonce in America, persecuted those vvho disagreed with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Williams was run out of Massachusetts for his views championing \ntotal religious freedom for all. He formed the colony of Rhode \nIsland, the only colony that granted religious freedom for all. Later \nRhode Island College (now Brown University) was formed arid was the \nonly college in America that anyone could attend, regardless of \nreligion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first president of Harvard College, Henry Dunster, was fired for \nbelieving Baptist views on baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. John Clarke, a Baptist niinister and physician, was one of \nseveral Baptist riiinisters sentenced to be whipped at the State \nHouse in Boston for holding a worship service without permission.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Colonial Virginia, many Baptist ministers were imprisonedl for \npreaching without a license.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese circumstances led a group oI Baptist ministers to meet with \nJames Madison in Virginia prior to the constitutional convention that \nled to the Bill of Rights ard insist on the language, which became \nthe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis experiment with religious freedom was not without opposition. \nMany states were slow to follow. Baptists in Connecticut were \npersecuted\tbecause the Congregational Church controlled the state. \nThey wrote to President Jefferson in 1801, stating \"that religion  is \nat all times and places a matter between God and individuals (sic).\" \nThey asked his help in making it clear that all persons should have \nreligious freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson replied in a letter dated, January 1, 1 802, \"Believing \nwith you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and \nhis God: that he owes account to none other for his faith or his \nworship: that the legislative powers of the government reach actions \nonly, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that \nact of the whole American people which declared that their \nlegislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a \nwall of separation between church and state.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSlowly, over time, all states also embraced religious freedom for \nall. Today, many still attack this \"wall of separation.\" In The \nSouthern Baptist Texan, published by the fundamentalist Southern \nBaptists of Texas Convention, Mark Coppenger writes, \"this wall is \nnot found in the Constitution. Other SBC leaders agree.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Madison wrote in 1819, \"The number, the industry, and the \nmorality of the priesthood, and the devotion of the people have been \nmanifestly increased by the total separation of the Church from the \nState.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity Today published an article quoting Alexis de Jocqueville \nduring his famous tour of America in 1831. Tocqueville wrote that he \nfound a vibrant, flourishing crop of denominations and churches and \nthat all agreed that \"the main reason for the quiet sway of religion \nover their country was the complete separation of church arid state.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe added that throughout his stay in America he met \"nobody, lay or \ncleric, who did not agree about that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHas the experiment worked? I think it has. No other country has such \nlively and public debates over religion. Many other countries \nroutinely fight wars over religious beliefs but none have occurred in \nAmerican history.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica, by not officially being a Christian nation, has become a \nvery Christian nation with as much as 70 to 80 percent of the \npopulation claiming to be Christian, without official governmental \npressure to convert to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreedom of religion naturally encourages people to think for \nthemselves, and provides the backbone for democratic government. \nPeople come to America for religious freedom and naturally embrace \neconomic freedom. By championing public schools early in our history, \na direct result of religious freedom, we are a highly educated \nsociety, which leads to a more prosperous society.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat makes America, America? It's primarily because of religious \nfreedom, which guarantees all our freedoms. Those who would change \nwhat is the backbone of our democracy and our freedom are headed in a \ndangerous direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Currie\u0014\nMainstream Baptist Network Journal, Jan-Feb 2004\u0014",

    "title": "SOURCES OF SADISM",
    "words": "Was it conditions at Abu Ghraib or perverse human nature that led to \nthese atrocities?\u0014\nBY MARIANNE SZEGEDY-MASZAK\u0014\n\u0014\nThose hoping to see a flicker of anger or remorse or conscience on \nthe faces of the American soldiers photographed tormenting Iraqi \nprisoners in Abu Ghraib are likely to be disappointed. Evidence of \nhow these young recruits apparently became gleeful sadists can be \nfound in neither their faces nor their biographies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many theories have been advanced about the forces that \ntragically came together at Abu Ghraibinadequate training, \noverzealous intelligence gathering, failure of leadershipnone can \nadequately account for the hardening of heart necessary for such \nsadism. So the question is: Are there particular conditions in Iraq \ntoday that might shed light on why these soldiers committed these \nunconscionable acts?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe usual points of reference in psychology are two classic studies \nthat attempted to explore the capacity for evil residing in normal \npeople. In 1971, Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo created a \nsimulated prison and randomly assigned students to be either guards \nor prisoners. With astonishing speed, the guards indulged in forms \nof torture and humiliation not unlike those horrifying us today. This \nfollowed on earlier experiments by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram \non obedience to authority. Milgram recruited volunteers to \nparticipate in what he described as a study on learning. An actor sat \nin a chair that students believed was wired with electricity. Each \ntime this actor would give an incorrect answer, the students would be \ndirected by Milgram to deliver a larger shock. As the subject in the \nelectric chair seemed to suffer more and more, 2 out of 3 of the \nunwitting students administered shocks that would have been lethal in \nreal life.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery soldier? These experiments demonstrate that Everyman is a \npotential torturer. But what relevance does that have to Baghdad \ntoday? Robert 0km, a professor of psychiatry at the University of \nCaliforniaSan Francisco who has worked with victims of torture, says \nthat while there are lessons to be learned from these studies, the \nparticulars of the soldiers' life in Abu Ghraib also need to be taken \ninto account. In Iraq, 0km says, the abuse became an inexcusable way \nof working off their rage, anxiety about their own safety, and their \nsense of helplessness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe anxiety and helplessness are exacerbated by difficult living \nconditions and constant dangerincluding the unfavorable odds of 450 \nmilitary guards overseeing 7,000 often hostile prisoners. Then there \nis the issue of sex: One of the least discussed aspects of the \noccupation in Iraq has been the lack of a reliable local brothel \nwhere male soldiers are able to unwind. Experts have long appreciated \nthe fact that sexual activity can often be a way of relieving the \nanxiety of war.\u0014\nAbu Ghraib also has three traits that psychologist Herbert Kelman has \ndescribed as necessary for torture: authorization, routinization, and \ndehumanization. To translate the jargon, authorization means that \nsomeone with power needs to say that extreme measures are acceptable. \n(Pfc. Lynndie England said in an interview last week that her \nsuperiors said, Hey, you're doing great; keep it up.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorization leads to routinization, a kind of division of labor. In \nNazi Germany, for example, one person had responsibility for writing \nthe orders to deport the Jews, someone else for shaving their heads, \nand so on. The guards at Abu Ghraib were told they were merely \nsoftening up the prisoners for interrogation. Such parceling out of \nresponsibility, says Boston psychiatrist Jonathan Shay, seems to \ntantalize someone's moral compass, making it possible to do things \nthat might be personally distasteful.\u0014\n\u0014\nDehumanization follows. In Vietnam the enemy became slopes, and in \nIraq they're towel heads. Covering prisoners' faces with hoods, 0km \nadds, makes it possible for the soldiers to sever any empathic human \nconnection with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe protected walls of Abu Ghraib made it an island where \nconventional morality no longer applied. When these soldiers testify \nat court-martial, perhaps their testimony will contribute to the \npsychological theories on blind obedience to authority. However, 0km \nsays, The ethical questions just don't go away; horror doesn't go \naway by being able to explain it. And indeed, as the explanations \nalways fall short, the horror continues to loom large..\u0014\n\u0014\n30 U.S.NEw5 & WORLD REPORT, MAY 24, 2004\u0014\nDehumanization, typically, requires authorization.\u0014",

    "words": "'Stonewalled\u0014\nSaddled with expectations, 'Smarty' succumbs to long shot's stretch \nrun\u0014\n\u0014\nBY JOHN MARKON\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER\u0014\n\t\u0014\nJun 6, 2004\u0014\n\u0014\nELMONT, N.Y. - Smarty Jones was the name on everyone's lips at \nyesterday's Belmont Stakes, but, at the finish line, the Bird was the \nword.\u0014\n\u0014\nLightly regarded Birdstone, dismissed at 36 to 1 by a record Belmont \nPark crowd of 120,139, was the most determined and most successful of \nSmarty Jones' Belmont challengers, ultimately surging past the \nfavorite in the stretch and winning by a length.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the first loss of Smarty Jones' career after eight victories \nand insured that Thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown would remain \nunclaimed since 1978, when Affirmed was the 11th and most recent \n3-year-old to sweep the series.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmarty Jones, bet down to 3 to 10, became the ninth consecutive \nTriple Crown candidate to finish in a position other than first in \nthe Belmont Stakes.\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It hurts, really hurts, to say this,\" said John Servis, trainer of \nSmarty Jones, \"but what you saw out there is what makes our game so \ngreat. You can never be sure of the winners of these races until \nthey're over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 136th Belmont was over for Smarty Jones with a full furlong \nremaining as he slowed noticeably when only a moderate amount of \nspeed would have been necessary to hold off Birdstone.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe top two finishers were eight lengths clear of third-place Royal \nAssault, but both crawled through the stretch run. Birdstone's \nwinning time for 1 miles was 2:27 2/5, but time for the last furlong \nwas a very slow 27 seconds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Smarty Jones gave me everything he had, which he always does,\" said \njockey Stewart Elliott, \"but he didn't have anything left for \n[Birdstone]. I saw that horse running at me, but I couldn't hold him \noff.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder other circumstances, it would have been a popular victory for \nNew York-born trainer Nick Zito, who had saddled second-place \nfinishers in five previous Belmont Stakes but had yet to win.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaratoga socialite Marylou Whitney, the breeder and part-owner of \nBirdstone, is the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt \"Sonny\" Whitney and a \nmember of one of New York's most prominent, old-money racing \nfamilies. She was also winning her first Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I almost feel like I should say I'm sorry,\" Whitney said, \"because, \nreally, I am. I think almost everyone in racing was rooting for \nSmarty Jones. He's been so good for our sport, and it would have been \nwonderful to see him win a Triple Crown.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAttempting to analyze the loss, Servis focused on his horse's \ninability to \"settle\" or easily run behind the early pace set by \nPurge and Rock Hard Ten.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter about a half-mile of running third, Smarty Jones went to the \nlead entering the backstretch without any visible prompting from \nElliott.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was just dragging me along with him,\" Elliott said. \"I still felt \ngood, though. I thought he'd be OK.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he would have been, if not for Birdstone, whose backers were \nrewarded with a $74 payoff on a $2 win ticket. The 4-9 exacta paid \n$139.00.\u0014\n\u0014\nBig numbers at the mutual windows are an old story to winning rider \nEdgar Prado, who notched his first Belmont triumph in 2002 when \nSerava ($142.50) was one of seven horses to finish in front of that \nyear's Triple Crown hopeful, War Emblem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter both rides, Prado and his horse were booed as they entered the \nwinner's circle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My chance was to stay back and hope for a run at the end,\" Prado \nsaid. \"I know the people wanted Smarty Jones to win and want to see a \nTriple Crown, but this is my job . . . this is why they pay me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the week, Zito had said he'd have been happy with a \nsecond-place Belmont finish for Birdstone, a winner of the Grade I \nChampagne Stakes at age 2 but a resounding flop as a 3-year-old. \nBirdstone came into yesterday's race off a fifth-place finish in the \nBlue Grass Stakes and an eighth-place run in the Kentucky Derby, \nwhere he was 15 lengths behind Smarty Jones.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Birdstone's really small, not much more than 1,050 pounds,\" said \nZito, \"but he showed me today he has a big heart. If he didn't, we'd \nall be over at Smarty Jones' barn celebrating a Triple Crown.\"\u0014",

(THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\u0014\nJOHN MARKON COLUMN: The great horses can't run too long\u0014\n\u0014\nELMONT, N.Y. Deteriorating weather forecasts for today's Belmont \nStakes only seem to be enhancing the probability that odds-on \nfavorite Smarty Jones will emerge from the race as Thoroughbred \nracing's first Triple Crown winner since 1978.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmarty Jones, as they say on the backstretch, \"drinks mud.\" He's \nundefeated (8-0) on all tracks wet and dry, but his past three races \nhave come on damp or drying tracks and each has been more impressive \nthan the one before it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dark chestnut had a peak performance in the May 15 Preakness, \nwhen stewards rated the track \"fast\" even though it was considerably \nless than quick after absorbing a large quantity of overnight rain.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Smarty Jones' winning time of 1:55 2/5 was two seconds off the \nPreakness record, he won by an unprecedented 11 lengths and turned \nin a standout effort in the context of the slow times for the day's \nother winners. The Daily Racing Form credited Smarty Jones with a \nBeyer speed figure of 118, one of the highest Beyers awarded to a \nhorse of any age in years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the world of Beyer numbers, which attempt to REIGN quantify a \nhorse's performance in a given race, higher is better and anything \nover 110 is Hall of Fame territory.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My horse is a good horse that'll run on anything,\" said John Servis, \ntrainer of Smarty Jones. \"I'm still hoping for a dry, fast track . . \n. what you'd normally want to see in a big race like this one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSmarty Jones, a daunting 2-to-5 in the morning line, will face eight \nrivals over the 136th Belmont's 1 miles. They include the second- \nand third-place finishers in the Preakness, Rock Hard Ten and \nEddington. The second choice in the early line at 5-to-1 is Purge, \ntwice a loser to Smarty Jones during Oaklawn Park's spring series of \nKentucky Derby preps.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a victory today, Smarty Jones would become not only the 12th \nTriple Crown winner but the wealthiest Thoroughbred of all time. He'd \nadd the $900,000 winner's share of the Belmont purse and a $5 million \nsponsor's bonus for a Crown sweep to his lifetime earnings of $7.3 \nmillion, which already places him fifth on the all-time list.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmarty Jones could walk back to his barn with a bankroll of more than \n$13 million, easily moving past Cigar ($9.9 million) into the No. 1 \nspot.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're not going start counting any money unless we win,\" said \nServis. \"If we do . . . and after we've put Smarty away for the night \nin his stall, I think we'd do some celebrating.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York Racing Association officials are still hoping to celebrate \nrecord crowds and betting handles, but they had the same hopes last \nyear before daylong rains cut into the live gate as Funny Cide, a New \nYork-bred gelding, made a bid for a Triple Crown.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter planning for as many as 120,000 spectators given good weather \ntoday, NYRA officials still feel they might exceed their Belmont Day \nrecord of 103,000, set in 2002 when War Emblem was the star \nattraction.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday's forecasts call for showers beginning before dawn and \npotentially lasting through the 6:38 p.m. Belmont Stakes post time. \nTemperatures may not escape the low 60s.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the same sort of day last June when Funny Cide appeared to \nstruggle on a sloppy surface and finished third behind Empire Maker, \na horse that had established proven ability in the mud.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not all wet tracks are the same,\" said Barclay Tagg, Funny Cide's \ntrainer. \"Funny Cide doesn't have a problem with damp or heavy \ntracks, but we learned on Belmont Day that he doesn't like real slop \n. . . puddles and standing water.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSmarty Jones is the ninth horse to come to a Belmont with a Triple \nCrown in his sights since Affirmed last swept the series 26 years \nago. Of the previous eight, only Funny Cide was beaten on a wet \nsurface.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We'll be there, rain or shine,\" said Servis. \"I don't think that a \nwet track is necessarily an advantage, but I won't use it as an \nexcuse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe horses running against Smarty Jones usually need the excuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nContact John Markon at (804) 649-6891 or jmarkon@timesdispatch.com\u0014",

    "title": "SHOULD WE FIGHT FOR \"UNDER GOD\"",
    "words": "Should We Fight for \"Under God\"?\u0014\nThe right approach to these two little words may not be obvious.\u0014\nBy Collin Hansen\u0014\n\u0014\nIf  the U.S. Supreme Court decides later this month to strike the \nphrase \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance, America could be in \nfor a rhetorical facelift. Not only will millions of schoolchildren \ncease reciting the Pledge known by their parents and grandparents, \nbut other American symbols would also appear to be on the way out. \n\"In God We Trust\" no longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the Supreme Court may choose to side with the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans, who want the Supreme Court to preserve the \nPledge with \"under God.\" When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nstruck the phrase in 2002, their decision sparked widespread public \noutrage. Politicians voiced their indignation, while religious \nleaders decried the ongoing secularization of America.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs usual, some historical perspective can help us think about this \nissue.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudging by the public reaction, one would think George Washington or \nAbraham Lincoln penned the Pledge. Actually \"under God\" first \nappeared in the Pledge as a Cold War-era addition. But the history of \nthis phrase extends back to the nation's birth. And during the Civil \nWar, these two words comforted a nation unsure whether their \nexperiment with democracy would succeed. Nevertheless, is it possible \nthat a seeming Supreme Court victory could actually be a defeat in \ndisguise?\u0014\n\u0014\nColumbus Day Composition\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pledge of Allegiance made its debut in 1892 when Massachusetts \neducator and Baptist minister Francis Bellamy authored the oath for \nColumbus Day festivities. Celebrating the 400th anniversary of the \nexplorer's landing in America, schoolchildren around the nation \nrecited the Pledge: \"I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the \nRepublic for which it stands, one nation indivisible, with liberty \nand justice for all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis first version of the Pledge reflects the lingering effects of \nthe Civil War, from which the nation was still recovering. Bellamy's \noath stresses the inseparable Union and ideal of fair treatment of \nall citizens regardless of race. Near the end of the 19th century \nthese concerns persisted as immigrants streamed into America from \naround the world. The Pledge underwent a small revision in 1924 to \nclarify that Americans pledged their allegiance to \"the flag of the \nUnited States of America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pledge did not change again until 1954, when Congress approved \nthe addition of \"under God.\" This was the era of America's Cold War \nstand-off against the aggressively atheistic Soviet Union. Americans \nwholeheartedly supported the change in the same spirit that led them, \ntwo years later, to approve \"In God We Trust\" as the national motto.\u0014\n\u0014\nPartly spurred by Cold War uncertainties, Americans flocked to church \nduring the 1950s, fueling a boom for Protestant and Catholic churches \nalike. After more than two decades of uncommon upheaval at home and \nabroad, many sought God's comfort. As he approved the Pledge \nalteration, President Eisenhower echoed these concerns. \"In this way \nwe are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's \nheritage and future,\" he said. \"In this way we shall constantly \nstrengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our \ncountry's most powerful resource in peace and war.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAppealing to God for Independence, Preservation\u0014\n\u0014\nCongress reached into American history for \"under God.\" In the throes \nof the Revolution, George Washington had spurred his troops to \nvictory by invoking God's provision. As the Continental Congress \nprepared to ratify the Declaration of Independence in the summer of \n1776, with British troops gathering on their doorstep, Washington \nmade the stakes clear to his army. \"The time is now near at hand \nwhich must probably determine whether Americans are to be freemen or \nslaves,\" he told the troops. \"The fate of unborn millions will now \ndepend, under God, on the courage and conduct of the army.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the phrase gained universal notoriety during a later, equally \nprecarious period of American history. Following the deadliest battle \nof the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln delivered our nation's most \nmemorable speechthe Gettysburg Address. \"Under God\" did not appear \nin Lincoln's early drafts of the speech, but it surfaced in the \nspoken version:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining \nbefore usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to \nthe cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that \nwe here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; \nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and \nthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall \nnot perish from the earth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln never clarified the precise meaning of \"under God,\" but \npresumably he meant to convey America's dependence on God and \nsubmission to God's expectations for justice. Especially late in his \nlife, Lincoln did shy away from discerning God's earthly purposes. In \nhis second inaugural address, Lincoln pointed to the sin of slavery \nand said God gave \"to both North and South this terrible war as the \nwoe due to those by whom the offense came.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Lincoln had additional motivations for invoking the Almighty. \nDeeply saddened by the war's devastation, he worked to ensure that \nAmerica would never again think of separation. Lincoln believed that \nif he could foster a civil religion, Americans would consider their \nnation to be sacred and thus indissoluble.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond the Pledge\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln's vision for civic religion should give Christians pause. \nEven if the Supreme Court retains \"under God,\" the justices will do \nso only if they determine the phrase bears no genuine religious \nmeaning. In other words, either \"under God\" serves to perpetuate \nAmerican civil religion, or the phrase will be removed.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have no interest promoting civil religion. America-worship \nis but a shadow of citizenship in heaven. When government co-opts \nreligion in this way, genuine religious belief is cheapened. But if \ncivil religion demeans Christianity, does God have a place in \ndemocracy?\u0014\n\u0014\nMore important than defending a phrase, Christians can revive the \ntrue meaning of \"under God.\" They can elect public officials who \nacknowledge and submit to God's standards of justice in their \ndecision-making. And they can help renew America's commitment to \n\"liberty for all,\" because only \"under God\" are all men created \nequal. In secular and religious ideologies that reward human effort, \nmen are anything but equal. Human equality is only possible when God \nlays low human divisions and renders null our uneven attempts to earn \nour way to heaven on earth or above.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today\u0014",

Without \nthinking about himself he instinctively jumped in to help his friend.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rescue happened Monday as Karah, Donnie, and his 4-year-old \nbrother explored the apartment complex where their families live. \nKarah, who was visiting her grandmother at the complex, knew the \nlocation of an empty swimming pool on the grounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She wanted to show the pool,\" said Karah's aunt, Bernadette Choate. \n\"She didn't expect the gate to be unlocked.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA maintenance worker had been sent out to the pool that day to do \nsome work, Baldermann said. Faced with a locked gate and no key, the \nworker cut the lock to get in.

    "words": "Sending Old Men To War \u0014\n\u0014\nIf I could, I'd enlist today and help my country track down those \nresponsible for killing thousands of innocent people in New York City \nand Washington, DC But, I'm over 50 now and the Armed Forces say I'm \ntoo old to track down terrorists. You can't be older than 35 to join \nthe military. They've got the whole thing backwards. Instead of \nsending 18-year-olds off to fight, they ought to take us old guys. \u0014\nYou shouldn't be able to join until you're at least 35. For starters: \u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers say 18-year-olds think about sex every 10 seconds. Old \nguys only think about sex a couple of times a day, leaving us more \nthat 28,000 additional seconds per day to concentrate on the enemy. \nYoung guys haven't lived long enough to be cranky, and a cranky \nsoldier is a dangerous soldier. If we can't kill the enemy we'll \ncomplain them into submission. \"My back hurts!\" \"I'm hungry!\" \n\"Where's the remote control?\" An 18-year-old hasn't had a legal beer \nyet and you shouldn't go to war until you're at least old enough to \nlegally drink. An average old guy, on the other hand, has consumed \n126,000 gallons of beer by the time he's 35 and a jaunt through the \ndesert heat with a backpack and M-60 would do wonders for the old \nbeer belly. An 18-year-old doesn't like to get up before 10 a.m. Old \nguys get up early every morning to pee. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf old guys are captured we couldn't spill the beans because we'd \nprobably forget where we put them. In fact, name, rank, and serial \nnumber would be a real brainteaser. Boot camp would actually be \neasier for old guys. We're used to getting screamed and yelled at \n(most of us are married) and we actually like soft food. We've also \ndeveloped a deep appreciation for guns and rifles. We like them \nalmost better than naps. They could lighten up on the obstacle \ncourse, however. I've been in combat and didn't see a single 20-foot \nwall with rope hanging over the side, nor did I ever do any pushups \nafter completing basic training. I can hear the Drill Sergeant now, \n\"Get down and give me...er...one.\" And the running part is kind of a \nwaste of energy. I've never seen anyone outrun a bullet. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn 18-year-old has the whole world ahead of him. He's still learning \nto shave, to actually carry on a conversation, and to wear pants \nwithout the top of his butt crack showing and his boxer shorts \nsticking out. He's still hasn't figured out that a pierced tongue \ncatches food particles, and that a 400-watt speaker in the back seat \nof a Honda Accord can rupture an eardrum. All great reasons to keep \nour sons at home to learn a little more about life before sending \nthem off to possible death. Let us old guys track down those dirty \nrotten cowards who attacked our hearts on September 11. The last \nthing the enemy would want to see right now is a couple of million \nold farts with attitudes.\u0014",

    "title": "SEX WITH KINGS - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "If prostitution is the worlds oldest profession, then being a \nmistressan art that is infinitely more subtle, requiring not only a \nmastery of sexual skills, but an aptitude for intrigue or even \ntreacheryis probably the second oldest. Given these qualifications, \nit follows that a kings mistress is the finest example of her breed, \nand throughout history, this select group of women has been the \nsubject of intense interest, prurient fantasy, and endless \nspeculation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEleanor Herman takes us on a revealing journey into this rarified \nrealm, introducing Europes most powerful monarchs and the mistresses \nunder them. Sex with Kings tells the stories of some of the most \nfascinating women in history, among them Alice Perrers, courtesan of \nEdward III (1312-1377); Madame du Barry, the stupid yet lively \nmistress of Louis XV; Wallis Simpson, who dreamed of being Edward \nVIIIs queen but was forced to content herself with the disappointing \nreality of life as the Duchess of Windsor after Edward abdicated; \nCamilla Parker-Bowles, whose passionate nature contributed to the \ndemise of the marriage of Diana Spencer and Charles, the present day \nPrince of Wales.\u0014\n\u0014\nStealing from the kings deathbed\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise of the royal mistress began in the late medieval period when \nthe weakening of the Churchs demands for discretion and the first \nflowerings of literacy allowed the names and exploits of notable \nkingly concubines to be recorded for posterity. The aforementioned \nAlice Perrers was one of the first subjects of these early writings. \nNotable for her avarice, Alice used her position to become one of the \nlargest landowners in England, took advantage of the aged Edward \nIIIs senility and convinced him to buy her the same jewels over and \nover. Finally, sitting by his deathbed, she pried his rings off his \nstiffening fingers and ran off with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nLetter writing became popular among courtiers, and diaries became \nfashionable. Examples that have survived give us eyewitness accounts \nof royal sexual intrigues. One of the best-known diarists was Samuel \nPepys, who worked in a high-level position in the English Naval \nOffice in the 1660s, and had a lascivious fascination for the \nmistresses of Charles II.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrading sex for titles\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the 16th to 18th centuries, the position of royal mistress was \nalmost as official as that of prime minister, and the mistress was \nexpected to perform certain dutiessexual and otherwisein return for \ntitles, pensions, honors, and an influential place at court. The \nFrench Revolution ended the power of royal mistresses across Europe, \nbut the sexual needs of the king did not. While 20th-century \nmistresses such as Simpson and Parker-Bowles led far less gilded \nlives, their stories are no less absorbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerman has the ability to blend meticulous research with an enjoyable \nwriting style that makes the book impossible to put down. Sex with \nKings may well become the definitive work on this subject. 288 PAGES \n 6 1/8\" x 9\"\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Eleanor Herman worked for German-based Monch \nPublishing as Associate Publisher of NATOs Nations and Partners for \nPeace from 1989 through 2002.

If this author wants to \nrepresent all women, then do research! I am a woman and I'm working \non towards my PhD in history. I found this book insulting to my \nintelligence. The author tries to pretend that the Popes were \noutraged by the affairs that the Kings were having, but a little \ndigging would have informed her that the Popes were also keeping \nmistresses. It is silly that she attempts to put her 21st century \ninsight into the Middle Ages. This book lacks direction and \norganization. Don't waste your time or money on this book.\u0014",

    "title": "ST. PATRICK OF IRELAND -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "It comes as a surprise to most people that Patriciusthe man we call \nSt. Patrickfirst came to Ireland as a slave when he was 15 years \nold. Even more surprising is the reason why: once the Roman navy \nsailed away from the Irish Sea, and the Roman legions retreated to \nthe Continent, there was nothing to stop Irish raiders from preying \non the isolated towns and villas of western Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn St. Patrick: A Biography, Philip Freeman, an expert in both Celtic \nand classical studies, sets Patricks life within the context of the \ndeclining Roman world, when Roman culture was fading away in outposts \nlike Britain, barbarians were raising hell along the frontiers, and \nChristianity was one religion among many.\u0014\n\u0014\nLousy at Latin\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost everything we know about Patrick comes from two documents \nwritten by the saint. One is his Confession, a longish, partially \nautobiographical letter composed when he was an old man. The other is \nLetter to the Soldiers of Coroticus, a denunciation of a bandit king \nwho had captured a large number of newly baptized Irish Christians \nand sold them into slavery. These documents are not Irelands answer \nto Samuel Pepys diary, but they do give us a tantalizing glimpse of \nPatricks world: petty kings, pagan gods, quarrelling bishops, \nbrutal slavery, beautiful virgins, and ever-threatening violence. \nThey also are a window into Patricks personality, and even his level \nof formal educationclassicists tell us that Patricks Latin was \nrough at best.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatricks life and times make for lively reading. For example, in his \nConfession he says that when he was 15 he committed a sin so serious \nhe had never been able to forgive himself. It must have been serious \nindeed since decades later his fellow bishops found out about it and \nwanted to drum Patrick out of the ranks. After studying Patricks \ntext and which sins the early Church considered especially grave, \nFreeman concludes that Patrick must have killed someone.\u0014\n\u0014\nWild Irish\u0014\n\u0014\nConverting the Irish could not have been easy. Freeman describes \ncustoms that could never be reconciled with Christianity. As part of \nthe installation of a new king, for example, the royal candidate was \nrequired to have sex in front of all his subjects with a white mare. \nTo predict the future, Druids stabbed a sacrificial victim in the \nbelly and watched which way the blood spurted.\u0014\n\u0014\nA people that went in for blood spurts and bestiality may seem like a \ntough crowd for a missionary, but Patrick never doubted that he could \nwin them over to the Christian faith. And he was right. The impact \nthat conversion had on the Irish, and on every corner of the globe \nthe Irish call home, is incalculable. This new biography tells us how \nit all began. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: Philip Freeman is the author of Ireland and the \nClassical World. He is Professor of Classics at Washington University.\u0014",

The Toyota Prius is \nsellig so well dealers can't keep it in stock. Meanwhile the Honda \nCivic Hybrid is starting to look as unpopular as the last kid on the \nplayground picked to play kickball.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat explains the difference? Not the motor. Both vehicles boast fuel \nefficiency. Rather, the Prius looks more like a hybrid, and feels \nmore like a hybrid. As marketing researcher Art Spinella explained, \n\"The Prius is a fashion statement.... Other people know the driver is \ndriving a hybrid vehicle. It clearly makes a bigger statement about \nthe person than does the Civic, which basically looks like a Civic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA lawyer with the EPA agrees: \"With the all-electric mode (of the \nPrius], there's just the coolness factor.

If ostentatious wealth once suggested moral superiority \nin a more Calvinistic time, ostentatious displays of environmental \npiety might be meant to suggest moral superiority in a more secular \none.

Iraq, which had been on the list under Saddam \nHussein's regime, was removed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Defending the sacred ground of human conscience is a natural \ncommandment to all mankind and America will always heed this call,\" \nSecretary of State Colin Powell said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDesignation on the CPC list does not carry immediate sanctions, and \nreturning countries faced little more than diplomatic pressure. \nStill, human rights advocates say being listed among \"the worst of \nthe worst\" is a significant signal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an \nindependent watchdog group chartered by Congress in 1998, had urged \nPowell to also add Pakistan and Turkmenistan to the CPC list in its \nMay report. The panel was divided on whether India should also be \nlisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nPressure had been mounting on Powell to add the Saudis to the CPC \nlist, despite their key role in the war on terrorism. Critics accuse \nthe kingdom of exporting a militant form of extremist Islam known as \nWahhabism and suppressing all non-Muslim religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Hanford, the U.S. ambassador at large for religious freedom, \nnoted some \"sincere improvements\" among the Saudis to reign in \nextremists, open dialogues with Shi'a Muslims and revising textbooks \nwith \"inflammatory statements\" against non-Muslims.\u0014\nStill, Hanford said such steps were not enough. \"We just feel the \nimprovements aren't adequate at this point to put them in a position \nwhere they do not deserve designation,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report was more blunt than Hanford's public comments, noting that \n\"freedom of religion does not exist\" in Saudi Arabia, a distinction \nonly shared with North Korea.\u0014\n\u0014\nFactors cited in the other \"countries of particular concern\" included:\u0014\n\u0014\n    * China: \"intimidation, harassment and detention\" of members of \nunderground religious groups, especially Falun Gong, and a \"poor\" \nrespect for religious freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Burma: government monitoring and infiltration of private \nreligious groups and restrictions on Buddhists and Muslims to worship \nfreely.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * North Korea: \"arrest and harsh penalties\" for proselytizers of \nunauthorized religious groups and deaths of underground church \nmembers. \"Genuine religious freedom does not exist,\" the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Vietnam: persecution and detention of minority Protestants and \nfaiths that are not officially recognized by the government.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Eritrea: persecution of Pentecostal, evangelical, Orthodox and \nJehovah's Witnesses. \"Prisoners of conscience are often subjected to \ninhumane treatment that includes poor living conditions and abuse,\" \nthe report said.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Iran: imprisonment, harassment, intimidation and discrimination \ndirected against Sunni Muslims, Baha'is, Jews and Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Sudan: second-class status for non-Muslims and \"ethnic \ncleansing\" against ethnic black Africans in the western Darfur region \nthat has killed at least 30,000 and displaced millions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Too many people continue to suffer for the belief or practice of \ntheir faith and too many governments refuse to recognize or protect \nthis universal right,\" Hanford said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report cited five countriesAfghanistan, Georgia, India, Turkey, \nand Turkmenistanfor \"significant improvements\" in religious freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe State Department report went beyond the eight CPCs to single out \nproblems in other nations. Many of the CPCs were included on other \nlists, but the report included a wide scope of nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nCuba and Laos were included on a list of countries cited for \n\"totalitarian or authoritarian actions to control religious belief or \npractice,\" along with Burma, China, North Korea, and Vietnam.\u0014\n\u0014\nA list of nations cited for \"state hostility toward minority or \nnon-approved religions\" included Pakistan, Turkmenistan and \nUzbekistan, along with Eritrea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose cited for \"state neglect\" for persecution of minority religions \nincluded Bangladesh, Egypt, Georgia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, \nNigeria, and Sri Lanka.\u0014\n\u0014\nDiscriminatory or prejudicial policies were found in Azerbaijan, \nBelarus, Brunei, Israel/Palestinian territories, Malaysia, Moldova, \nRussia, and Turkey.

This towering new biography offers the first full-scale \nportrait of a figure whose excesses are the stuff of legendbut whose \npersonal life has largely escaped close scrutiny.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most intimate portrait of Stalin so far, if you dare to \nlook.New York Times Book Review\u0014\n\u0014\nDrawing on a wealth of previously secret documents, Montefiore \nreveals Stalin as doting father and grieving widower; convivial host \nwith a natural ability to charm; voracious reader of history and \nliterature; megalomaniacal murderer of 20 million. With the intimacy \nof a family scrapbook, Stalin shows us not only the dictator himself, \nbut also details the shocking culture of sexual sadism, paranoia and \ndebauchery that ruled the lives his inner court.\u0014\nFor once, the well-worn historical details of Stalins reign take a \nback seat to three-dimensionality in an unflinching portrait of a \nnormal man who embodies the notion that absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely.\u0014\n\u0014\nBY SIMON MONTEFIORE\u0014\n\u0014\n========================\u0014\nUNKNOWN STALIN - A BOOK REVIEW\u0014\n\u0014\n A startling new biography shedding brilliant light on Joseph Stalin \nand those closest to him, based on recently revealed evidence and \nwritten by two distinguished historians. Giving the best and most \ninformative explanation to date of the mystery of Stalin's death, \nrenowned historians Roy and Zhores Medvedev have written a gripping \nnew biography of Joseph Stalin, based on findings from research into \narchives only recently made available, as well as the Medvedev \nbrothers' own experiences during and after Stalin's brutal regime. \nConventional beliefs and cliches are contradicted and disproved, \ninaccuracies and misconceptions are corrected, and the facts about \nStalin's intellect, ancestry, and the fortunes of his personal \neffects after his death are fully examined. Perhaps most remarkable \nof all are the Medvedevs' revelations and contentions concerning \nStalin's death: There has been much suspicion over whether he was \nassassinated or died of natural causes, and the authors go a long way \ntoward resolving this question. The Unknown Stalin resonates with \nparticular intensity due to the personal detail and recollections of \nthe two authors--each of whom has his own history as a Russian \ndissident and commentator. This startling new work represents one of \nthe most significant contributions to the study of Russian history in \ndecades, a book of vital interest to scholars and general readers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBY Medvedev, Roy and Dahrendorf, Ellen and Medvedev, Zhores\u0014\n\t\t\u0014",

It didnt \nprove that way in Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nScalia said There is something wrong with the principle of \nneutrality toward religion as applied by courts today. Neutrality \nenvisioned by the founders is not neutrality between religiousness \nand nonreligiousness; it is between denominations of religion, he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nScalia said official examples of faith expression go back to \nAmericas establishment, such as the word God on currency, \nchaplains in the military, tax exemption for churches and the phrase \nunder God in the Pledge of Allegiance.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nNone of this is compatible with what we say when we express the \nso-called principle of neutrality, Scalia said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nI suggest that our jurisprudence should comport with our actions.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nScalia last year removed himself from the Supreme Courts review of \nwhether under God should be removed from the Pledge of Allegiance \nbecause of statements he made about references to God in public life.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nYou will not hear the word God cross the lips of a French premier \nor an Italian head of state, he said. But that has never been the \nAmerican way.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nAdvocates for church-state separation condemned Scalias comments.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nJustice Scalia has repeatedly expressed wrong-headed views on the \nseparation of church and state, but his latest remarks are truly \noutrageous, said Joe Conn of Americans United for the Separation of \nChurch and State. To even suggest that church-state separation \nplayed a part in bringing about the Holocaust shows an appalling \nignorance of history and a complete lack of judicial temperament.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Dreams columnist Thom Hartmann said that rather than \nseparating church and state, Hitler used the German state church to \naid his rise to power. Hartmann linked to a National Holocaust Museum \nsite showing photos of religious leaders giving a collective Nazi \nsalute.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBruce Prescott of Mainstream Oklahoma Baptists said Scalia, like \nmost theocrats, persists in revising history to fit his ideology. \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is, one of the biggest reasons why Europe is so much more \nsecular than America today is because the church failed so dismally \nin facing the Nazi menace, Prescott, who is also president of the \nOklahoma chapter of American United for Separation of Church and \nState, said in his weblog. \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nIts not hard to project the same result for this nation once people \nperceive the tragic effects of the unholy alliance between the \nevangelical theocrats and the neo-conservative empire builders who \nare forming our current foreign policy.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

The Trokosi, taken to appease the presumed anger \nof the gods, range in age from 5 to more than 60 years. In 1991, \nworkers with the International Needs Network (IN Network), an \nevangelical ministry based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, began visiting \nvillages with shrines and talking with leaders, shrine elders, and \npriests. Ghana Baptist Convention ministers did the same.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We started with education, making people aware that it's not right \nto keep the girls in the shrines for offenses committed by other \npeople,\" said Walter Pimpong, executive director of IN Network Ghana. \nStaffers argue that ending slavery is in the best interest of the \nvillage, said Rody Rodeheaver, IN Network's U.S. president: \"Slavery \nkeeps villages in bondage and keeps the economy poor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGhana Baptists, the IN Network, and others joined the United Nations \nto successfully lobby Ghana's government to ban the practice in 1998. \n\"But because it's a religion, the government is a bit careful to \ndialogue and get people to stop,\" said Kojo Amo, general secretary of \nthe Ghana Baptist Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one case, according to Ghanaian fetish priests, the gods were \nangered when Mercy Senahe's great aunt stole a visitor's earrings. \nThe visitor pronounced a death curse on Mercy's family. Soon after, \nfamily members started dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo atone for the crime, the family surrendered Mercy's young cousin \nAdzo to perpetual slavery at a Trokosi shrine some three hours from \nher village; the shrine was built by followers of the traditional \nAfrican religion, which has strong ties to voodoo. As a Trokosi \nslave, Adzo received scant food or clothing, no education, and \nregular beatings. Her duties included hard farm labor, cleaning the \nshrine's grounds, and carrying water. After puberty, her duties \nincluded sex with the shrine's fetish priests.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when Adzo died in the shrine, priests said the gods demanded \nanother little girl. The family sent Mercy. She was about 8 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nTypically, it takes five to seven years of negotiation and dialogue \nbefore the elders and priests free the slaves, including shrine \nchildren born into slavery. A liberation ceremony rescinds the \ncurses, thus prompting some families to accept them. More than 3,300 \nTrokosis have been freed, but some 5,000 remain enslaved in Ghana \nalone. Trokosi slavery is practiced in Africa's Volta region, which \nincludes parts of Ghana, Togo, and Benin.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Trokosis are unskilled illiterates. Families often reject the \ngirls. Without intervention, girls fall into drugs, crime, and \nprostitution. Both the IN Network and Ghana Baptists offer schooling \nand job training for freed Trokosi, where they also hear the gospel. \nGhana Baptists plan to build a vocational training complex for freed \nTrokosis and others. Almost all receive Christ, Amo and Rodeheaver \nsay.\u0014\n\u0014\nIN Network missionaries shared the gospel with slaves in Mercy's \nshrine. One woman missionary began praying for Mercy's release. Soon \nthe shrine freed the new Christian. IN's vocational institute \naccepted Mercy, now 27, and her four children, supplied their \nphysical needs and school fees, and trained her in bread baking, \nwhich she does for a living. She dropped the name the fetish priests \ngave her and adopted the name Mercy because her freedom came from the \nmercy of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today. \u0014\nFebruary 2005, Vol. 49, No. 2, Page 22\u0014",

    "words": "Liar, Lunatic, or Saintly Warrior?\u0014\n\u0014\nFaith & Values Media revisits history's mysterious Joan of Arc.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Steven Gertz | posted 03/17/2005\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Joan of Arc? Loony schizophrenic? Demon-possessed adventurer? \nOr was she the saint that the Roman Catholic Church in 1920 made her \nout to be?\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan of Arc lived during a chaotic time in France's historyEngland \noccupied Paris and much of the country during the Hundred Years' War \n(1337-1453). A peasant from the French village of Domremy, Joan \nreportedly began receiving visions from God in 1425 at the age of 13. \nShe was to go to the French Prince Charles (Dauphin), or so the \n\"visions\" said, and offer her services in the fight to relieve the \ncity of Orleans besieged by the offending English.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan gets a word from God\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan's leadership in the defense of Orleans is legendary, and the \nsubsequent coronation of Charles was likewise the crown of her \nsuccess. But Charles' refusal to support her attack on Paris (the \nfilm speculates Charles was jealous of Joan's fame) was but the first \nturn of misfortune that led to Joan's capture and trial by the \nEnglish. The English sympathizer Bishop Cauchon charged her with 70 \ncounts of heresy, and on May 30, 1431, Joan was burned at the stake \nat the age of 19.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tale is fraught with conundrums. What (or who) convinced this \npeasant girl to take up the sword and lead the French army to war at \na time women were expected to stay within the domestic confines of \nthe home? Did God really instruct Joan to fight the Englishthat it \nwas the \"will of God\" that the French defeat their enemies? How can \nwe be sure the \"voices\" Joan heard and obeyed really came from God?\u0014\n\u0014\nFaith & Values Media shows admirable restraint in telling Joan's \nstory. Wagner does not sensationalize the drama (tempting though that \nmight be) but puzzles through the twists and turns of an ordinary \ngirl's path to greatness. One must at least give Joan credit for her \nextraordinary courage, leading men (with a history of defeats) into \nbattle with little training. Wagner aims to take Joan on her own \nterms, following her road to military success while avoiding the \ntemptation to showcase Joan as a tragic victim of male political \nintrigue.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan of Arc offers a few glimpses of real insight. Francoise Meltzer \nof the University of Chicago, for example, astutely observes that \nthose who dismiss Joan's voices as a case of schizophrenia are \nignoring the force of will and logic that Joan would later \ndemonstrate (something most schizophrenics are unable to do). If \nanything, the films makes a convincing case that Joan descended into \nmental stress only at the point that her heresy trial interrogators \npushed her to say her voices came from St. Michael, Margaret and \nCatherine, not God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's not to say the documentary's commentary is always spot on. \nMolina's concluding commentJoan's story remains an inspiration to \nanyone who believes in following your voices even if it consumes \nyouis throwaway. That smacks of postmodern relativity foreign to the \nsensibilities of Joan's age.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut don't let that deter you. Joan of Arc is worth your hour, if only \nto hear Joan tell her own story in her own words (her testimony was \nsaved in the trial's proceedings). As for how to evaluate Joan's \nspiritual standing, her answer to Bishop Cauchon may have to do for \nnow: \"If I am not [saved], may God put me there. If I am, may God \nkeep me there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Gertz is assistant editor of Christian History & Biography \nmagazine and ChristianityToday.com.\u0014",

    "title": "SCHIAVO CASE ABOUT DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE",
    "words": "Paper Says Schiavo Case About Defense of \nMarriage\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n04-11-05\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Terri Schiavo case proves that conservative Christians pushing \nfor Federal Marriage Amendment are actually anti-marriage, according \nto an investigative report on a pro-polygamy Web site.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Henkel, founder of TruthBearer.org, a non-Mormon organization \nthat believes the Bible doesnt prohibit having more than one wife, \nwrote a 10,000-word essay arguing that the Schiavo case should never \nhave been portrayed as a pro-life struggle, but rather as a defense \nof marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article portrays Michael Schiavo as a loving husband who remained \nfaithful to his wifes care, despite meddling in-laws who tried to \nget courts to interfere in their marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n It notes that many conservative judges hearing the case saw it \ndifferently from conservatives in general. The reason, it concludes, \nis that the courts knew all the facts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article, which includes URL links to several news reports and \nlegal documents cited as references, also contends:\u0014\n\u0014\n--It took three years after Terri Schiavos 1990 cardiac arrest for \nher husband to come to terms with the reality she would not recover \nand accept the idea of letting her die naturally.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, originally agreed with her \ndiagnosis as a persistent vegetative state and urged him to begin \ndating.\u0014\n\u0014\n--That amicable relationship changed on Valentines Day in 1993, when \nMichael Schiavo says the Schindlers asked him about getting their \nportion of a $300,000 loss of consortium award to him as part of a \n$1 million medical malpractice claim.\u0014\n\u0014\n--The Schindlers tell a different story, but Pinellas County Circuit \nJudge George Greer ruled in February 2000 that while it is unclear \nwhether any promises had been made, it was Michaels refusal to \nequally divide the award with the Schindlers that created the breach.\u0014\n\u0014\n--After that, the Schindlers filed a court petition asking that \nMichael Schiavo be removed as Terris legal guardian and began \ncirculating new stories. They included allegations that Michael had \nstrangled Terri that night in 1990, that he abused her throughout \ntheir marriage and that he \"tried to kill\" her in 1994, when in \nconsultation with a doctor he elected not to treat a urinary-tract \ninfection and to impose a do-not-resuscitate order if she went into \ncardiac arrest.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Reports that he had two children with another woman were unclear \nthat the first childs birth came 12 years after Terris tragedy, \nnine years after the Schindlers urged him to start dating again, four \nyears after he filed his first petition to have her feeding tube \nremoved and two years after the first court order authorizing its \nremoval.\u0014\n\u0014\n--While Michael Schiavor said his wife told him she did not want to \nbe kept alive artificially, the Schindlers said in court they would \nhave fought removal of the feeding tube even if Terri had specified \nit in a living will.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Conservative media ran with the Schindlers story. Instead of \nbelieving the husband, they chose to report from the perspective of \nthe in-laws, embracing the classic anti-man radical feminist agenda \nto never believe the husband.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Conservative media sites like WorldNetDaily.com and NewsMax.com \ncommitted danratherismsa reference to the retired CBS anchorman \ndisgraced when documents challenging President Bushs military record \nproved to be falseby repeating unverified allegations by Terri \nSchiavos parents without double-checking the facts.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Sincere pro-life protestors, meanwhile, confused the issues, by \nasserting Terri was being cruelly deprived of food and water. In \nfact she had not eaten or drunk anything since 1990. She received \nnutrition and hydration artificially through a modern-technology \nfeeding tube, and if one of the protestors trying to bring her water \nduring her final days had succeeded, she would have been unable to \nswallow it and might have drowned.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Many argued that a feeding tube is different from other life \nsupport, but both Florida law and guidelines by the American College \nof Cardinals define feeding tubes as artificial life support. A \ndecision to remove a feeding tube is no different than removing a \nrespirator from someone whose lungs have failed or a dialysis machine \nfrom someone with kidney failure, other than the length of time it \ntakes for natural death to follow.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Liberal activist judges who allowed her to die were the same \ncourt system that awarded the disputed 2000 presidential election to \nGeorge W. Bush.\u0014\n\u0014\n--The Schiavo case went several times to the U.S. Supreme Court, and \nnot once did the courts most conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, \nClarence Thomas or William Renhquist, offer any dissent.\u0014\n\u0014\n--The Schindlers were incorrectly referred to as Terris family, \nbut they technically were not. According to the Bible, therefore \nshall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his \nwife: and they shall be one flesh, Terris family is her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Numerous reports described Michael Schiavo as Terris estranged \nhusband, which was never the case. Instead of defending the intimacy \nof conversations between a husband and wife, they undermined the \nvalidity of marriage by dismissing Michaels testimony about Terris \nwishes as hearsay.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost surprising, the article says, was widespread acceptance of the \nSchindlers suggestion that Michael Schiavo ought to just divorce \nTerri so they could care for her.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo marriage-committed wife would ever want to die as being divorced \nfrom her husband, and no husband would want that either, Henkel \nwrote. No wonder Michael Schiavo rightly rejected such an offensive \noffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue marriage proponents would never even begin to contemplate the \nanti-marriage idea of a divorce of a couple who clearly love each \nother, he continued. Indeed, that very suggestion is downright \noffensive to anyone who is genuinely committed to the institution of \nmarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article singles out Richard Land of the Ethics & Religious \nLiberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, who appeared \nMarch 27 on NBCs Meet the Press with Tim Russert.\u0014\n\u0014\nLand, who supports an amendment to the Constitution defining marriage \nas between a man and woman, said he was shocked that parents have so \nfew rights and called for laws allowing any related person to have \nveto power over a spouse if there is a dispute over end-of-life \ndecisions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf somebody doesnt have a living will and the next of kin disagree \non whether the person should be kept alive or that whether food and \nwater should be taken away and her life ended  really the benefit of \nthe doubt ought to be given to life, Land said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat anti-marriage suggestion, the article says, would empower any \ndysfunctional in-law to fraudulently exploit that kind of pro-life \nposition to explicitly undermine, filibuster and overturn the \nintimate relationship and discussions between a husband and wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article also blasts Lands big-government belief that the law \nexists to express our values.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch ideology, of course, is not conservative or Christian in any \nway whatsoever. After all, any government that is liberally \nauthorized to be used for social engineering to express conservative \nvalues can just as easily be later exploited to express liberal \nvalues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe articles foreward describes the author as an established \nChristian polygamy advocate who is a truly constitutional \nconservative and an adamantly pro-life, Bible-believing Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is described as a must read for both conservatives and liberals, \nbecause as Christian polygamists think for themselves and study the \nBible more diligently than others, the same method of seeking out \nonly the true facts is equally applied to the Schiavo case.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this case, supposed-to-be conservatives who claim to want to \nprotect marriage had the opportunity to do just that, the article \nconcludes. But instead of protecting marriage in the Schiavo case, \nthey decidedly turned against it.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "SURPRISED BY ORTHODOXY",
    "words": "Surprised by Orthodoxy\u0014\nBy Thomas C. Oden\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nClassic Christianity lives out of a history of consensual ecumenical \nworship. It depends not upon any particular individual's view but \nupon how the classic consensus molds a particular person's daily \nlife. My story is living evidence of how a life can be radically \nreversed by meeting the saints of classic Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Ph.D. studies at Yale, I taught in two seminaries. Although it \nwas assumed that I was teaching theology, my heart was focused on \nradical visions of social change and on the blatant politicizing of \nthe mission of the church. I was uncritically accommodating to the \nvery modernity that pretended to be prophetic, yet I did not \nrecognize modernity's captivity to secular humanistic assumptions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reversal occurred when Will Herbert, my irascible, endearing \nJewish mentor told me that I would remain theologically uneducated \nuntil I had studied carefully Athanasius, Ambrose, Basil, and Cyril \nof Alexandria.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his usual gruff voice, he said, \"Tom, you have not yet met the \ngreat minds of your own tradition. Just as I, after my Communist \ndays, found it decisive to read the Talmud and the Midrashim \ncarefully to discover who I was as a Jew, you will have to sit at the \nfeet of the ancient Christian writers to discover who you are as a \npossible person of faith. Without solid textual grounding, you will \nbecome lost in supposed relevance. If you are going to deepen to \nbecome a working theologian instead of a know-it-all contemporary \npundit, you had best get at it.\" I was stunned. He had nailed me.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I worked my way through the beautiful texts of classic \nChristianity, I reemerged out of the secularizing maze to delight in \nthe holy mysteries of the faith and in the recurrent puzzles of human \nexistence. Rather than interpreting texts, I found the texts \ninterpreting me. They freed me to ask a broader range of questions: \nHow can God have become truly human without ceasing to be God? How \ncan human freedom, when so distorted by the history of sin, have been \nradically atoned in the cross? If God is almighty and all good, how \ncan God allow sin to have such a persistent hold on human social \nprocesses?\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery question I thought was new I found had been already much \ninvestigated. I was on the threshold of the intergenerational wisdom \nof the ancient community of faith, which I found was still persisting \nas a living, caring community. I now stand within the blessed \npresence of the communion of saints of all generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat changed the course of my life? Attentiveness to the text of \nScripture, especially as viewed by its early consensual interpreters: \nAthanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Chrysostom in the East; \nAmbrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory the Great in the West.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1972, I read through the 14th volume of the Nicene and Post-Nicene \nFathers in a few days of engrossed concentration. It is an unadorned \nreport of the definitive canons (including pastoral judgments, not \nmerely the dogmatic decrees) of the ecumenical councils and \nsignificant regional councils that fed into the great general \ncouncils of the first millennium. I have not been the same since. \nThat reading affected everything I would touch as a teacher, writer, \nand editor for the rest of my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have been searched out and found by ancient wisdoms.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas C.

    "words": "Anna Quindlen-The Last Word\u0014\nSeparate, Not Equal at All\u0014\n\u0014\nMost orthodoxies have found a way to make women both apart and less, \nby turning them into near occasions of sin or angels in the house.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Anna Quindlen\u0014\nContributing Editor, Newsweek\u0014\n\u0014\nMay 2 issue - Here is where we begin: with Easter, the holiest day of \nthe Christian calendar, with the visit by Mary Magdalene to the tomb \nin which Jesus is laid after the crucifixion. The body is gone, and \nshe runs to find the apostles Peter and John to tell them so. They \nlook, run off, and she remains, distraught. A man approaches; she \nmistakes him for the gardener.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe says, \"Woman, why are you crying?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe very first word Jesus says after his resurrection is our name. \nAnd perhaps that explains why Roman Catholic women who have been so \npoorly served by our church refuse to leave. The members of the \nhierarchy do not engage us in conversation, but their founder did.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou need only look at photographs of the pope and his cardinals to \nsee the essential problem. A phalanx of identicals, the closest they \ncome to daily contact with women is with the nuns who keep house for \nthem. Half the world is out of bounds. The Catholic Church is not \nalone in this. Many religions have found some way to make women both \napart and less, either by turning them into near occasions of sin or \nangels in the house. When a female Islamic scholar bucked tradition \nby leading a group of Muslim men and women in prayer at a ceremony \nlast month in New York, some protesters insisted that restrictions on \nwomen's roles were a sign of respect, while a man who disrupted the \nevent recommended stoning for those involved.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's a sense that the world is out of control and chaotic, and \nthat if we can control our women then the world will be a safer \nplace,\" says Randall Balmer, a professor at Barnard who is an expert \non evangelical Christianity. \"That's a real perception on the part of \na lot of religious conservativesMuslims, Catholics, Protestant \nfundamentalists.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the years that he was running the Congregation for the Doctrine of \nthe Faith, the new pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, demanded a \nchurch press destroy copies of a book promoting the ordination of \nwomen, summoned American bishops to Rome to see that their pastoral \nletter on the role of women toed the church line, and was behind a \nmove to get rid of altar girls. In a 2004 letter to the bishops, he \nexplained that while feminists had seen fit \"to give rise to \nantagonism,\" what his fellows should remember was the \"genius of \nwomen,\" a genius that boiled down to all the old stereotypes: \nemotional, nurturing, warm. (In life, humans are blessed with \nindividuality; in orthodoxy it is wiped away.) Proving that Scripture \ncan always be made to say what you want, he quoted St. Paul\"in \nChrist there is neither male nor female\"as a reaffirmation of the \ndifferences between the sexes, when it appears to be exactly the \nopposite.\u0014\n\u0014\nCardinal Ratzinger once famously suggested that all religions, too, \nwere second-class, except for his own, so perhaps he does not care \nabout other communities of faith. The Anglicans manage to worship God \nwith both female priests and married clergy; the Archbishop of \nCanterbury once brought his wife, the mother of his four children, to \nmeet John Paul II. Judaism now prospers under the leadership of \nfemale rabbis in what one scholar called \"the greatest change in \nJewish life since the destruction of the temple in the first \ncentury.\" Can it be that the leaders of both groups are so \nwrongheaded, that only rigidly conservative thinkers have gotten it \nright?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe argument in orthodoxy is usually that women are separate but \nequal, an argument that made racial segregationand flagrant \ninequalitypossible for many years in the United States. Power is not \nrelinquished easily; fear of the other is an enduring human handicap. \n\"What orthodoxy is partly about is fear,\" says Rabbi Joy Levitt. \"The \nworld is moving very fast, and not all of it is positive.\" But \nultimately many faiths came to the conclusion that strictures on \nwomen were the product of outdated norms and entrenched prejudice, \nnot sacred texts. Their leaders embraced the possibility that modern \nequality could abet spiritual growth. Rabbi Levitt recalls the words \nof the founder of the Reconstructionist movement, Mordecai Kaplan: \n\"Tradition ought to have a vote, not a veto.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCatholic women are not naive. They do not expect a new pope to wake \none morning, wave a magic staff and make ordination possible and \nsexual responsibility individual. But it would be nice to have a \npontiff consider the role of women in the modern church out of some \ncommunication with women themselves. The very fact that anyone would \nbe able to write such a sentence illustrates how deep the chasm is \nbetween the church of the people and the church of the hierarchy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all those who ask why we stay, I say: because it is our church. \nLiteralists like to harp on the gender of Jesus himself. What they \noverlook is the fact that in clear violation of the norms of his own \ntime, the founder of the faith surrounded himself with women. In \nseeking the counsel, opinions and advice of female Catholics, church \nleaders would not be conforming to modernity, but modeling Christ. \nThey argue that they cannot tailor church bedrock to suit social \nfashion. The truth is that they have tailored its bedrock to suit \ntheir blind spots. \"Woman,\" the new pope might ask, \"why are you \ncrying?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n 2005 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

The Dutch pastor and his family \nhad \u0014\nbeen hiding Jewish people in their home to keep them safe from \nHitlers \u0014\nforces. They were eventually found out. And one night in the \ndarkness, \u0014\nthey heard the sound of heavy boots and the loud impatient knocking \non the \u0014\ndoor. They were arrested and loaded into a cattle car to be taken to \none \u0014\nof the notorious death camps. All night long the Dutch pastor and his \u0014\nfamily rode along in heart-breaking anguish, jostling against one \nanother \u0014\nand against the other prisoners who were jammed into the train cattle \ncar. \u0014\nThey were stripped of any form of dignity and absolutely terrified. \nThey \u0014\nknew they were being taken to one of Hitlers extermination centers. \nBut \u0014\nwhich one? Would it be Auschwitz, Buchenwald, or Dachau? \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the long night ended and the train stopped. The doors of the \u0014\ncattle car were opened and light streamed into that tragic scene. \nThey \u0014\nwere marched out and were lined up beside the railroad tracks, \nresigned to \u0014\nunspeakable pain, as they knew they would be separated from each \nother and \u0014\nultimately killed. But in the midst of their gloom, they discovered \nsome \u0014\namazing good news good news beyond belief.

And \nthose \u0014\nnow who came to them were not their captors at all, but rather their \u0014\nliberators. Instead of being marched to death, they were welcomed to \nnew \u0014\nlife. In the midst of his joy and relief, the Dutch pastor said, \nWhat do \u0014\nyou do with such a gift?\u0014",

    "words": "LIBERAL BIBLE THUMPING\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\nPublished: May 15, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nEven aside from his arguments that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were \nmarried and that St. Paul was a self-hating gay, the new book by a \nformer Episcopal bishop of Newark is explosive.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Shelby Spong, the former bishop, tosses a hand grenade into the \ncultural wars with \"The Sins of Scripture,\" which examines why the \nBible - for all its message of love and charity - has often been used \nthrough history to oppose democracy and women's rights, to justify \nslavery and even mass murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a provocative question, and Bishop Spong approaches it with \ngusto. His mission, he says, is \"to force the Christian Church to \nface its own terrifying history that so often has been justified by \nquotations from 'the Scriptures.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book is long overdue, because one of the biggest mistakes \nliberals have made has been to forfeit battles in which faith plays a \ncrucial role. Religion has always been a central current of American \nlife, and it is becoming more important in politics because of the \nnew Great Awakening unfolding across the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet liberals have tended to stay apart from the fray rather than \nengaging in it. In fact, when conservatives quote from the Bible to \nmake moral points, they tend to quote very selectively. After all, \nwhile Leviticus bans gay sex, it also forbids touching anything made \nof pigskin (is playing football banned?) - and some biblical passages \nseem not so much morally uplifting as genocidal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Can we really worship the God found in the Bible who sent the angel \nof death across the land of Egypt to murder the firstborn males in \nevery Egyptian household?\" Bishop Spong asks. Or what about 1 Samuel \n15, in which God is quoted as issuing orders to wipe out all the \nAmalekites: \"Kill both man and woman, child and infant.\" Hmmm. Tough \nlove, or war crimes? As for the New Testament, Revelation 19:17 has \nan angel handing out invitations to a divine dinner of \"the flesh of \nall people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Spong, who has also taught at Harvard Divinity School, argues \nthat while Christianity historically tried to block advances by \nwomen, Jesus himself treated women with unusual dignity and was \nprobably married to Mary Magdalene.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity may have become unfriendly to women's rights partly \nbecause, in its early years, it absorbed an antipathy for sexuality \nfrom the Neoplatonists. That led to an emphasis on the perpetual \nvirginity of Mary, with some early Christian thinkers even trying to \npreserve the Virgin Mary's honor by raising the possibility that \nJesus had been born through her ear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe squeamishness about sexuality led the church into such \nabsurdities as a debate about \"prelapsarian sex\": the question of \nwhether Adam and Eve might have slept together in the Garden of Eden, \nat least if they had stayed longer. St. Augustine's dour answer was: \nMaybe, but they wouldn't have enjoyed it. In modern times, this same \ndiscomfort with sex has led some conservative Christians to a hatred \nof gays and a hostility toward condoms, even to fight AIDS.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Spong particularly denounces preachers who selectively quote \nScripture against homosexuality. He also cites various textual \nreasons for concluding (not very persuasively) that St. Paul was \"a \nfrightened gay man condemning other gay people so that he can keep \nhis own homosexuality inside the rigid discipline of his faith.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop also tries to cast doubt on the idea that Judas betrayed \nJesus. He notes that the earliest New Testament writings, of Paul and \nthe source known as Q, don't mention a betrayal by Judas. Bishop \nSpong contends that after the destruction of Jewish Jerusalem in A.D. \n70, early Christians curried favor with Roman gentiles by blaming the \nCrucifixion on Jewish authorities - nurturing two millennia of \nanti-Semitism that bigots insisted was biblically sanctioned.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the bishop's ideas strike me as more provocative than \npersuasive, but at least he's engaged in the debate. When liberals \ntake on conservative Christians, it tends to be with insults - by \nderiding them as jihadists and fleeing the field. That's a mistake. \nIt's entirely possible to honor Christian conservatives for their \nfirst-rate humanitarian work treating the sick in Africa or fighting \nsex trafficking in Asia, and still do battle with them over issues \nlike gay rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiberals can and should confront Bible-thumping preachers on their \nown terms, for the scriptural emphasis on justice and compassion \ngives the left plenty of ammunition. After all, the Bible depicts \nJesus as healing lepers, not slashing Medicaid\u0014",

We were \ncaptivated by the small, scrappy, blue-collar horse who overcame \nhumble beginnings, personal tragedy, life-threatening injury, and \nimpossible odds to come within inches of achieving horse racings \nultimate accomplishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo million-dollar Kentucky blueblood, Smarty Jones was just a \nmodestly bred colt from unfashionable Philadelphia Park. It is a \nmiracle that he ever raced at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Smarty was still a foal, his breeder was murdered, and Smarty \nwas nearly sold. Then he fractured his skull in a freak accident and \nalmost died. But when Smarty finally ran, he showed something \nspecial: he had courage, power, and devastating speed, the fastest \never recorded for a 3-year-old horse. Winning the Kentucky Derby, and \nthen the Preakness by the largest margin in history, he was \nundefeated until the final strides of his final race. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe cheered for Smartys talented trainer, John Servis, an ordinary, \nhardworking guy taking on racings elite.

You go about lecturing, do you not?\"\u0014\n\"Yes, honey, that's what I do. The Lord has made me a sign unto this \nnation, an' I go round a'testifyin' an' showin' on 'em their sins \nagin my people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFascinated by Truth's stories and demeanor, Stowe called down several \nof the more well-known ministers at the party. When asked if she \npreached from the Bible, Truth said no, because she couldn't read.\u0014\n\"When I preaches,\" she said, \"I has just one text to preach from, an' \nI always preaches from this one. My text is, 'When I found Jesus.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, you couldn't have found a better one,\" said one of the \nministers.\u0014\nIn fact, Truth preached on more themes than thatabolition and \nwomen's rights to name twoand became one of the most celebrated and \ncontroversial itinerants of her era.\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of slavery\u0014\nBorn a slave named Isabella Baumfree in southeastern New York, the \nfuture abolitionist had several owners during her childhoodmany of \nthem cruelbefore ending up the property of John Dumont at age 13. \nFor 17 years, she worked for him and then escaped. She made her way \nto the home of Issac and Maria Van Wagenerwhose home she said God \nshowed her in a vision. The Quaker couple bought her from Dumont and \nthen freed her.\u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of years later, she had an experience that solidified her \nemerging faith. According to her dictated autobiography, one day \"God \nrevealed himself to her, with all the suddenness of a flash of \nlightning, showing her, 'in the twinkling of an eye, that he was all \nover,' that he pervaded the universe, 'and that there was no place \nwhere God was not.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I jes' walked round an' round in a dream,\" the former slave later \ntold Stowe. \"Jesus loved me! I knowed it, I felt it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring her early years, though, her faith was confused, and at one \npoint she joined a cult whose leader eventually murdered one of the \nmembers; for another period, she followed the Millerites, who \npredicted Christ would return in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nWanting to make a fresh start, Isabella asked God for a new name. \nAgain she had a visionGod renamed her Sojourner \"because I was to \ntravel up an' down the land, showin' the people their sins, an' bein' \na sign unto them.\" She soon asked God for a second name, \"'cause \neverybody else had two names; and the Lord gave me Truth, because I \nwas to declare the truth to the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this new mission, she left New York and traveled throughout New \nEngland, attending local prayer meetings and others she called on her \nown. In 1850 she published her autobiography, written with Olive \nGilbert. It brought her fame, and with that fame came harassment. \nWhen she was once told the building she was to speak in would be \nburned if she preached, she replied, \"Then I will speak to the \nashes.\" Her quick wit and determination were only successful to a \npoint. After being physically assaulted by one particularly vicious \nmob, she was forced to walk with a cane for the rest of her life.\u0014\nIt was against slavery that the former slave made her most virulent \nattacks. But she was also a woman, and once she met other female \nabolitionists, she became an avid supporter of women's rights as \nwell. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor many northerners, this was even more controversial than her \nabolitionist preaching. Some tried to stop her from speaking at a \nWomen's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851they feared it \nwould weaken the abolitionist movement. But Truth spoke anyway, \ndelivering her most famous speech:\u0014\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages \nand lifted over ditches and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody \nhelps me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look at me! \u0014\n\u0014\nLook at my arm. I have plowed, I have planted, and I have gathered \ninto barns. And no man could head me. And ain't I a woman? I could \nwork as much and eat as much as manwhen I could get itand bear the \nlash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne children and seen \nmost of them sold into slavery, and when I cried out with a mother's \ngrief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?\u0014\nBy the end of the Civil War, Truth had met with Abraham Lincoln, had \nher arm dislocated by a racist streetcar conductor, petitioned the \ngovernment to make western lands available to freed blacks, and made \ncountless speeches on behalf of African Americans and women. In 1875, \nshe retired to her home in Battle Creek, Michigan, where she remained \nuntil her death.\u0014",

Like \"family\" values, as if \nthat were a settled compilation \u0014\n         waiting to be implemented; or \"states' rights, a onetime \ncover for perpetuating racial      \u0014\n         segregation in the name of freedom.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         The First Amendment cuts two ways.\u0014\n         First, it prevents the state from establishing\u0014\n         any religion as official. Second, it prevents\u0014\n         the state from denying people the right to\u0014\n         exercise their religion, whatever it may be.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Leading off the amendments guaranteeing\u0014\n         American freedoms, the prohibitions sought\u0014\n         to avoid the bloody religious wars that many\u0014\n         colonists came to America to escape, as well\u0014\n         as remembered excesses of intolerance in the\u0014\n         early colonies.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            Free exercise of religion seems well estab-\u0014\n         lished. although efforts continue against\u0014\n         nonmainstream religiotts practices as if\u0014\n         minoritv rights could be compromised with\u0014\n         out endangering the najority rights, a\u0014\n         delusion whose outcome we witnessed in\u0014\n         Germany in the I 930s.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            The \"establishment of religion\" question\u0014\n         seems more lively, although not in the same\u0014\n         form as in the 18th Century. I doubt that\u0014\n         compelling attendance at certain chttrches\u0014\n         has much appeal, except perhaps among the\u0014\n         proprietors of those churches. What some\u0014\n         want is to eetablish their particular beliefs in\u0014\n         the iaw of the land  specifically in laws\u0014\n         pertaining to sexuality, families, scientific ori-\u0014\n         gins and medical practices as opposed to\u0014\n         the topics Jesus actually addressed, namely,\u0014\n         wealth, power, mercy and justice.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Some insist that the United States is, or\u0014\n         was intended to be, a \"Christian nation, and\u0014\n         therefore \"Christian values (as they define\u0014\n         them, of course) must guide our laws.\u0014\n         Southern Baptist leader WA. Criswell\u0014\n         sounded the charge in a television interview\u0014\n         in 1984: I believe this notion (of the separa-\u0014\n         tion of church and state was the figment of\u0014\n         some infidels imagination.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            What do I think about separation of religion and state? \n(The amendment is\u0014\n         broader than church, a Christian term.)\u0014\n         \u0014\n            First, the impact of the First Amendment is not only to \nprotect\u0014\n         religion from incursions by the state, but also\u0014\n         to protect the state from the heavy hand of\u0014\n         religion. The amendment avoids what we saw\u0014\n         in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where religion and state \nbecame one, and the result was\u0014\n         total italian oppression, especially of women and religions \nminorities.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            Second, the issue at hand is the effort by conservative \nChristians to legislate their\u0014\n         moral views into local and federal law. It is precisely such \na heavy theocratic hand that\u0014\n         the Constitutional principle seeks to avoid. The issue isn't \ntheir moralality vs. no morality,\u0014\n         as if their slant on moral codes were absolute truth and \nanything less than that is a moral\u0014\n         vacuum. The issue is whether their narrow religious agenda \nbecomes the law for all citi-\u0014\n         zens.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            Third, the First Amendment doesnt prevent the religious \nfrom engaging in politics oi\u0014\n         from bringing their faith to that engagement. Indeed, both \nliberal and conservative\u0014\n         Christians believe their faith compels them be active \npolitically, although they come out\u0014\n         on different sides of most issues, despite quoting the same \nBible.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            Fiinally, we must learn from history. Religion tends to \nbecome both corrupt and\u0014\n          cruel when given the reins of state. We religious folks are \npoor rulers. Because we talk\u0014\n         about our faith in absolutes, we dont know how to \nconlpromise in the political arena, to\u0014\n         negotiate, to consider other peoples rights and views as \nlegitimate. We tend to be rigid,               \u0014\n         doctrinaire, ideological, resistant to change, far too \ncertain of our correctness, and at odds            \u0014\n         with any  data that disputes our writings or creeds.\u0014\n     \u0014\n         It seems far better for religious institutions to be \nserving, healing and teaching than\u0014\n         holding seats of power.

Family Life Radio, a first-class broadcaster, \nhas adopted a new program split of 88 percent music \"to appeal to the \n35- to 50-year-old demographic.\" A respected broadcaster recently \ndropped Focus on the Family on the grounds that it had become too \ninvolved in \"moral issues.\" Does anyone really believe the Bible is \nindifferent to moral questionsor that modern Christians should be?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne station cancelled my four-minute BreakPoint commentary saying \nthat four minutes is the equivalent of one song. Horrors! Besides, \nthe station manager allowed, BreakPoint is too serious and not \ncontemporary enough. When another major station, this one in \nCincinnati, replaced BreakPoint with music, I called the station \nmanager, arguing that believers need to think Christianly about major \nworldview issues. The young woman on the other end of the phone \nadmonished me: \"But we don't want to do anything that will upset our \nlisteners.\" Younger women, she said, want \"something to help them \ncope with life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis view was confirmed by a Christian homemaker interviewed for a tv \nspecial on evangelicalism. She is so busy, she explained, taking care \nof the kids, family activities, Bible study, cooking, etc., that she \ndoesn't even read the newspaper or care what is happening in the \nworld around her. Church for her is getting her spirits lifted.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, modern life does create enormous stress. But can't the \nchurch offer comfort and help people confront the culture?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe decision by influential Christian broadcasters and music \ncompanies to avoid moral controversies could result in the church \nwithdrawing from the culture as it tragically did a century ago. What \nis the job of Christian radio, after all? To give people what they \nwant, oras with any ministryto give them what they need? Music is \nimportant in the life of the church and can inspire us to focus on \nChrist. But it cannot take the place of solid teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe great strength of radio, as with books, has been to present \nin-depth teaching and moral discussion that engages Christians \ncognitively. This is something Americans find increasingly difficult. \nAccording to a recent study, the average college graduate's \nproficient literacy in English has declined from 40 percent in 1992 \nto 31 percent today. The study defines proficient literacy as the \nability to read lengthy, complex texts and draw complicated \ninferences. Think about it: One out of three college graduates cannot \nread a book or absorb a serious sermon.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the gospel above all else is revealed propositional truthtruth \nthat speaks to all of life. Yes, the gospel is simple enough for a \nchild to understand. Yet if you want to study doctrine and worldview, \nyou need the capacity to think. You need the capacity to engage ideas \ncognitively.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoctrine and biblical teaching are notas some \"emerging church\" \nadvocates believedry, dusty, abstract notions. This truth has to be \ncarried into the heart and applied. But there is no escaping that it \nis truth that must be learned.\u0014\n\u0014\nSure, skits and catchy music are good tools for drawing people in, \nand good Christian music on the radio can inspire us. But these \nthings aren't an end in and of themselves; they should engage us in \nlearning and applying truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Postman published his book two decades ago, he feared television \nwould impair our capacity to think. He was right. Can we learn from \nthisor are we destined to follow suit, the church blissfully amusing \nitself into irrelevance?\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Christianity Today.

    "title": "SBC BAPTISMS DECLINE",
    "words": "SBC Baptisms Decline\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen, Ethics Daily\u0014\n04-20-06 \u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist Convention President Bobby Welch's plan to \"rev up a \nrundown romance with reaching people\" may be in need of a jumpstart, \nwith statistics released Wednesday showing a decline in baptisms for \nthe fifth time in the last six years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to LifeWay Christian Resources, Southern Baptist churches \nreported 371,850 baptisms in 2005. That is 16,097 fewer than in 2004 \nand the lowest figure since 1993. LifeWay President Thom Rainer said \nSouthern Baptists should view the statistic as a \"wakeup call,\" \naccording to Baptist Press.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year baptisms were up after four straight years of decline. That \nprompted Jimmy Draper, Rainer's predecessor who has since retired, to \nbe cautiously optimistic that \"the denomination may be heading in the \nright direction.\" Draper pointed out that current SBC emphasis on \nbaptizing a million people in a year wasn't initiated until the 2004 \nSBC annual meeting in Indianapolis, allowing churches accepting the \nchallenge only a short time before the end of the reporting year. \nDraper said he would be \"surprised if we didn't see a considerable \njump\" in baptisms in information gathered for 2005.\u0014\n\u0014\nWelch's \"Kingdom Challenge\" goal of 1 million baptisms is officially \nfor 2005-2006 and results won't be tabulated until next year. At the \nmidpoint of the emphasis Welch said he believed it was picking up \nmomentum, but only a small percentage of churches had made the effort \nto report progress toward reaching the goal on a special \"Everyone \nCan\" Web site. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut publicity for the baptism challenge began far in advance of the \nofficial launch at the SBC annual meeting last June. In 2004 Welch, \npastor of First Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, Fla., embarked on a \n25-day bus tour to all 50 states promoting baptisms and sent a DVD to \n70,000 pastors and denominational leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast summer, leading up an evangelistic blitz held each year in \npreparation of the SBC annual meeting, Welch boldly predicted that \n\"Crossover Nashville\" could become \"the epicenter for the next Great \nAwakening.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking to the SBC Executive Committee in February, Welch warned \nagainst \"unfulfilled potential\" and \"squandered opportunity,\" \noffering ideas for how to \"rev up a rundown romance with reaching \npeople.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe with all my heart and soul that the Southern Baptist \nConvention is God's gift to the evangelical church world today,\" \nWelch said. \"There is absolutely nothing like it, nothing at all like \nit. And we must make the most of it in our time. The worst thing that \ncould happen to us is for all of us to stand collectively before God \none day and have to give an answer for squandered opportunity and the \ntragedy of unfulfilled potential.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2004 Draper lamented four straight years of declining baptisms as \nreflecting \"a denomination that has lost its focus.\" Draper said the \nfigures might reveal that increasing numbers of churches believe a \nprofession of faith is enough and don't pressure new believers to \nfollow through with baptism.\u0014\nDraper said the baptism figures might reveal that more churches \nbelieve a profession of faith is enough and dont pressure new \nbelievers to follow through with baptism, or that \"Perhaps our \ndenomination is simply failing to reach people for Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years Southern Baptist leaders though the denomination was immune \nfrom numerical decline. That is in part because of a popular but \ncontroversial 1972 book by Dean Kelley called Why Conservative \nChurches are Growing that linked decline in mainline denominations to \nsecularization and liberal clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany conservatives assumed that the \"conservative resurgence\" of the \n1980s and early 1990s would stop Southern Baptists from following the \nsame path.\u0014\n\u0014\nFreddie Gage, a Texas evangelist, told the audience at the 2002 SBC \nannual meeting in St. Louis that he remembered being in an all-night \nprayer meeting at the launch of the conservative movement in 1979 in \nHouston. \"I felt we were going to experience a revival, a revival of \nsouls,\" Gage said. \"It has not happened.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore coming to LifeWay, Rainer wrote while teaching at Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary that the SBC's baptism statistics had \nnot improved since 1979 and were essentially unchanged since the \n1950s.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"An honest evaluation of the data leads us to but one conclusion,\" \nRainer wrote in the Spring 2005 issue of The Southern Baptist Journal \nof Theology. \"The conservative resurgence has not resulted in a more \nevangelistic denomination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe SBC's high-water mark for baptisms was in 1972, when they \nnumbered 445,725. And that was with a much smaller church base. In \n1950 Southern Baptists recorded one baptism for every 19 church \nmembers. Today the ratio of baptisms to total membership is 1:44.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore recently Rainer wondered in an article in Baptist Press is the \nchurch is America \"is headed down the path of many European \ncongregations: decline and death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaige Patterson, a former SBC president and a co-founder of the \nconservative resurgence, said he believes the figures would be worse \nif there had not been a conservative movement. Be he added the \nnumbers are likely even more anemic than they appear, because there \nis no way of knowing how many are rebaptisms of people who already \nare in church and that many churches are baptizing children at \nyounger and younger ages to the point that \"Many of us are guilty of \nthe infant baptism we used to criticize everybody else for.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not everyone buys the argument that doctrinal fidelity is a magic \nbullet for evangelism. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe convention has not reached the 400,000-baptism plateau since \n2000, the year it revised the Baptist Faith & Message to narrow \ntheological parameters in place since the statement's last revision \nin 1963.\u0014\nOne of a laundry list of criticisms leveled at Bob Reccord, who \nresigned earlier this week as president of the SBC North American \nMission Board, was failure to articulate a \"consistent evangelism \nstrategy\" for the SBC.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Wuthnow, a professor of sociology of religion at Princeton \nUniversity, says it may be that demographics are catching up with the \nSBC and the denomination could be facing a long-term decline in \nmembership and loss of public influence similar to other moderate and \nliberal Protestant churches.\u0014\nSouthern Baptists' membership core--white and middle class--is aging, \nhe says, and migration patterns are pulling two directions, taking \nchurchgoers out of the Bible belt while people from less religiously \ninclined regions move into the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his remarks to the SBC Executive Committee, Welch surmised that \ndisasters like Hurricane Katrina and church fires in Alabama and \ncontroversy among convention leaders might be distractions to \nreaching the 1 million baptism goal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We must somehow become proficient enough in the spiritual \nwar-fighting that we are not overwhelmed by struggles,\" Welch said. \n\"Can you not fight with a scratch on your nose? Can you not lose a \npiece of your ear and keep going? Can you not take a flesh wound and \nstand up straight? Must you always lay down and whine when the least \ndifficulty comes along?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 2005 SBC statistics show miniscule growth in total church \nmembership of 0.02 percent, to 16,270,315. The number of churches \ngrew by 234 (0.5 percent) to 43,699.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother traditional strong indicator of church health, Sunday school \nenrollment, declined by 137,660, to a total of 8,068,780.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist churches took in more than $9.9 billion in total \ntithes, offerings and special gifts, and spent about $1.2 billion of \nit on missions. The total value of property owned by congregations \nexceeds $42 billion. About 6 million Southern Baptists, 37 percent of \nthe total membership, attended church on the average Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

I \nconcur with that statement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n Page titled his September 1980 doctoral dissertation at Southwestern \nBaptist Theological Seminary Toward a Biblical Ethic of Women in \nMinistry.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There are solid biblical bases for a full recognition of the freedom \nand responsibility of woman in ministry and the freedom of God's \nspirit to bestow the gifts for ministry upon men and women alike,\" he \nwrote. \"The time has come to declare that since the public activity \nof a woman is in most areas no longer considered as a breach of the \nmarriage vow and since the law of the land no longer denies to them \nthe right to act independently in mixed gatherings, qualified women \nare eligible candidates for any office in the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n In 190 pages, Page surveyed arguments both for and against women's \nordination from the Bible. He concluded by citing E. Glenn Hinson, at \nthe time a professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, who \nsuggested that ordination should be handled either by disposing of it \naltogether or applied to women or men without partiality.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the church makes any claim in its ordination that it is merely \nrecognizing the gifts of the Spirit, then it can hardly deny \nordination to women,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[O]ne must approach the biblical evidence regarding women with a \nhermeneutic methodologically adequate to maintain at least three \ndistinctions,\" Page wrote in the opening pages.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"First, one must take seriously the similarities and differences \nbetween the ancient world and the contemporary situation. Historical \ntexts have to be understood or evaluated in their historical setting, \nlanguage and form. Since the biblical texts have their origin in a \npatriarchal culture, they reflect the androcentric situations, \nconditions and values of the patriarchal culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Second, one must distinguish between the empirical description of a \ngiven historical situation and a theological affirmation of the \ndivine intention for that situation. In other words, one must note \nthe difference between that which the Bible records or describes and \nthat which it prescribes. For example, Jesus readily acknowledged the \nMosaic legislation regarding divorce in Deuteronomy 24, but in Mark \n10, He quickly attributed it to men's hardness of heart rather than \nto God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Third, one must define the unity of the Bible in such fashion as to \ngive coherence to the variety of its standards regarding women. If \nGod is one and His word is one, a conviction which is symbolized by a \nsingle Canon of Scripture, then His will for women is consistent \nrather than contradictory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Given the social role of women in the first century world, Christian \nwomen were extraordinarily active,\" Page wrote later. \"The Christian \nchurch included women from the very first. The women enjoyed complete \nrecognition as members of the church, or better, of the Family.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"While male leaders may have been more prominent and numerous in the \nearly church and while women's activities may have been somewhat \nlimited, many roles which ultimately were associated with the \nministry were evidently never restricted to men,\" he observed later. \n\"These limitations were probably due to that which was culturally \npermissible and also due to the limited education of most women of \nthe day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One must search the Scripture and then perhaps, one may be more able \nto determine whether or not the limitations placed upon women are the \nwill of God,\" he added still later. \"As a Christian, searching for a \nbiblical ethic, one must remember that the 'oughtness' of the issue \nmust be based on the revelation of God in the Bible and on the will \nof God as revealed in the life and teachings of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPage called Christ \"the great emancipator of women, and they were \namong his most devoted followers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile acknowledging \"the biblical storm center for the woman's issue \nis the Apostle Paul,\" Page opined that most of the Pauline \nprohibitions on women in roles of church leadership were cultural \nconcessions rather than eternal truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In a civilization in which woman was subordinate to her husband; \nwhere her place was in the home; where her freedom was restricted by \nsociety; Paul could not afford to proclaim a wholesale emancipation \nof Christian women from all the chains of custom. This was something \nwhich only time could bring about as a result of freedom found in \nChristianity,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The early church of which Paul was a part soon realized that if the \ntiny organism were to survive, it had to adjust itself to its \nenvironment. One may call it compromise or reversion to a \npre-Christian legalism, but one must see it as part of the age-long \neffort to live by Christianity in a world not yet ready for the \nfullness of Christ. If they were to survive, they had to be prepared \nto grow slowly, adapting means to ends, and developing the \norganization best suited to the practical business of evangelization. \nSuch tasks made enormous demands on their patience and wisdom. They \nhad to choose between the lesser and the greater good, to balance \nultimate principles against immediate needs, to work out their \nsalvation in a world as yet uninfluenced by their Master.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Therefore, one must remember the fact that one must not and cannot \nabsolutize the culture in which the Bible was written. If one \nmistakes the temporary arrangements to which the early church gave \nsanction for the eternal principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, \nthen one shall misconceive the character of Christianity and shall \nmake of it a mechanism, not a way of life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To absolutize the biblical culture would mean to assume that all the \nstandards of ancient Israel or first century rabbinic Judaism \nrepresent God's ultimate will for the human race. Instead of making \nsuch an assumption, one must make careful distinctions between what \nis 'for an age' and what is 'for all time.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPage said \"There is strong reason to believe that women served as \ndeacons in the Pauline churches,\" and noted that one disputed \ntranslation of Romans 16 refers to presumably a woman named Junia as \nan \"apostle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The very nature of the church and the nature of its ministry \nconstitute the essential reason why barriers should not be interposed \nto the entrance of qualified women into ministry,\" he wrote. \"To \nimpose barriers to women in ministry would be disloyal to God's gift \nof grace. This also amounts to autocratically placing obstacles \nagainst the working of the Holy Spirit in the church. This, in \nessence, would mean pulling the Holy Spirit down to the level of \nlimited human knowledge and understanding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Looking at the various viewpoints regarding women in ministry and \nhaving dealt with the related biblical passages, this writer agrees \nwith the  reasons for the participation of women in ministry, under \nthe leadership of the Holy Spirit,\" he wrote. \"This writer, at least \nin part, agrees  that social distinctions are meant to be \ntranscended, not perpetuated, within the body of Christ. They have \nbeen unfortunately perpetuated with a vengeance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com\u0014",

According to her dictated autobiography, one day \"God \nrevealed himself to her, with all the suddenness of a flash of \nlightning, showing her, 'in the twinkling of an eye, that he was all \nover,' that he pervaded the universe, 'and that there was no place \nwhere God was not.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I jes' walked round an' round in a dream,\" the former slave later \ntold Stowe. \"Jesus loved me! I knowed it, I felt it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring her early years, though, her faith was confused, and at one \npoint she joined a cult whose leader eventually murdered one of the \nmembers; for another period, she followed the Millerites, who \npredicted Christ would return in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nWanting to make a fresh start, Isabella asked God for a new name. \nAgain she had a visionGod renamed her Sojourner \"because I was to \ntravel up an' down the land, showin' the people their sins, an' bein' \na sign unto them.\" She soon asked God for a second name, \"'cause \neverybody else had two names; and the Lord gave me Truth, because I \nwas to declare the truth to the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this new mission, she left New York and traveled throughout New \nEngland, attending local prayer meetings and others she called on her \nown. In 1850 she published her autobiography, written with Olive \nGilbert. It brought her fame, and with that fame came harassment. \nWhen she was once told the building she was to speak in would be \nburned if she preached, she replied, \"Then I will speak to the \nashes.\" Her quick wit and determination were only successful to a \npoint. After being physically assaulted by one particularly vicious \nmob, she was forced to walk with a cane for the rest of her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was against slavery that the former slave made her most virulent \nattacks. But she was also a woman, and once she met other female \nabolitionists, she became an avid supporter of women's rights as \nwell. For many northerners, this was even more controversial than her \nabolitionist preaching. Some tried to stop her from speaking at a \nWomen's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851they feared it \nwould weaken the abolitionist movement. But Truth spoke anyway, \ndelivering her most famous speech:\u0014\n\u0014\n    That man over there says that women need to be helped into \ncarriages and lifted over ditches and to have the best place \neverywhere. Nobody helps me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look \nat me! Look at my arm. I have plowed, I have planted, and I have \ngathered into barns. And no man could head me. And ain't I a woman? I \ncould work as much and eat as much as manwhen I could get itand \nbear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne children and \nseen most of them sold into slavery, and when I cried out with a \nmother's grief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of the Civil War, Truth had met with Abraham Lincoln, had \nher arm dislocated by a racist streetcar conductor, petitioned the \ngovernment to make western lands available to freed blacks, and made \ncountless speeches on behalf of African Americans and women. In 1875, \nshe retired to her home in Battle Creek, Michigan, where she remained \nuntil her death\u0014",

It all began in 1926 on radio KAYO in Abilene, Texas, \nwhere he became radio broadcasting's first singing cowboy. In 1929, \nhe won a talent contest in Dallas, Texas and with the $100 cash prize \nin hand, he headed for Camden, New Jersey, to the Victor Talking \nMachine Company to seek his fortune. Recording four songs for the \nforerunner of RCA Victor, Stuart then set out for Hollywood, \nCalifornia, where he auditioned at KFI and went on the air as \"Cowboy \nJoe\". He also became a member of the original \"Beverly Hillbillies\", \nradio's first spectacularly popular western singing group.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1931, and for 21 years thereafter, Stuart stayed on top of the \npopularity charts on the West Coast with his radio programs: \"King \nCowboy and His Woolly West Review\"; \"Stuart Hamblen and His Lucky \nStars\"; and the \"Covered Wagon Jubilee\". During that time, his motion \npicture credits included: \"In Old Monterey\" with Gene Autry; \"The \nArizona Kid\" and \"King of the Cowboys\" with Roy Rogers; \"The \nPlainsman and the Lady\" and \"The Savage Hord\" with Wild Bill Elliott; \n\"Carson City Cyclone\" and \"The Sombrero Kid\" with Don 'Red' Barry; \n\"King of the Forest Rangers\" with Larry Thompson; and \"Flame of the \nBarbary Coast\" with John Wayne. In 1979 he also narrated a gospel \nmovie, \"Mountain Lady\".\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his long span on radio, Stuart composed western songs ... many \nof which are still being recorded today: \"Texas Plains\"; \"My Mary\"; \n\"Golden River\"; \"Walkin' My Fortune\"; and \"Ridin' Old Paint\". Later \nhe wrote some of his greatest song classics: \"It Is No Secret\" (note: \nthe original manuscript of which is buried in the cornerstone of one \nof the Copyright Buildings of the Library of Congress in Washington, \nD.C., and which has been translated into over 50 languages around the \nworld and was the first song to 'cross-over' becoming #1 in \nGospel/Country/and Pop categories and starting the trend for ballad \nstyle gospel songs) - SEE STORY BELOW; \"This Ole House\" (which was \nawarded 1954 Song of the Year, and was number one song hit in seven \ncountries at the same time, and is currently on Brian Setzer's album, \nThe Dirty Boogie, which has been on the Billboard's Top 100 for 36 \nweeks and counting!); \"Remember Me, I'm the One Who Loves You\"; \n\"Teach Me, Lord, To Wait\"; \"Until Then\"; \"Open Up Your Heart (and Let \nthe Sunshine In)\"; \"How Big Is God\"; \"His Hands\"; plus over 225 other \nsongs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1945, Stuart became the first man to fly a horse when he flew his \nrace horse, EL LOBO, from Los Angeles, California, to Bay Meadows on \nthe Flying Tiger Airlines. EL LOBO won the Burlingame Handicap ... \nand they flew home the same day. The history of the race horse was \nforever changed. The Bay Meadows racing form, \"War Horse\" was called \n\"The Flying Horse\" the day after the race.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1949, he attended a prayer meeting in Los Angeles where a young \nman named Billy Graham was preaching. He gave up his radio and film \nwork and publicly announced he was devoting his life to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early '50's, Stuart's radio show, \"The Cowboy Church of the \nAir\" was syndicated nationwide. This was also a time when commercials \nwere done by the radio host. During this time, the syndicate sponsors \nwanted Stuart to do a commercial promoting alchohl, and when Stuart \nrefused, due to the simple fact that his show was called The Cowboy \nChurch of the Air, the sponsors told him they would pull the plug on \nhis show. So, the last several shows, Stuart used them to let his \nnationwide-listening audience know why he would be leaving the air. \nBecause of this, in 1952, the Prohibition Party asked Stuart to run \nfor the President of the United States on their ticket. He did, and \nwhen the first returns came in he was actually ahead! When the final \nvotes were counted, he had set a new record for votes for the \nProhibition ticket, running 4th to Dwight D. Eisenhower.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarried to his wife, Suzy, for over 55 years, Stuart lived with her \non their horse ranch in Canyon Country (Los Angeles), California, \nwhere he produced his weekly nationally syndicated \"Cowboy Church of \nthe Air\" program. They also bred Peruvian Paso Horses, and their \nstallion, *AEV Oro Negro+, was 3 times U.S. National Champion of \nChampions.\u0014\n\u0014\nStuart Hamblen died on March 8, 1989. Besides his wife, Suzy, he \nleaves two daughters, Veeva and Lisa Obee, and 10 grandchildren and \n19 great-grandchildren.\u0014",

Taylor Skardon said after relating each ship's \nstory at the end of the ceremony.\u0014\n\u0014\nA priest gave a Hawaiian blessing and Marines performed a rifle \nsalute.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many it could be their last return to the World War II attack \nsite.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sixty-five years later, there's not too many of us left,\" said Don \nStratton, a seaman 1st class who was aboard the USS Arizona on Dec. \n7, 1941. \"In another five years I'll be 89.

Only the good Lord knows.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStratton and other survivors were boarding a boat to the white \nmemorial straddling the sunken hull of the USS Arizona, where they \nwill lay wreaths and lei in honor of the dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We thank those who lost their lives 65 years ago, and we honor the \nsurvivors and their families who are with us here today,\" said Hawaii \nGov. Linda Lingle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Arizona sank in less than nine minutes after a 1,760 pound \narmor-piercing bomb struck the battleship's deck and hit its \nammunition magazine, igniting flames that engulfed the ship.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore people died on the Arizona than any other ship as 1,177 \nservicemen, or about 80 percent of its crew, perished.\u0014\n\u0014\nAltogether, the surprise attack killed 2,390 Americans and injured \n1,178.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwelve ships sank and nine vessels were heavily damaged. Over 320 \nU.S. aircraft were destroyed or heavily damaged by the time the \ninvading planes were done sweeping over military bases from Wheeler \nField to Kaneohe Naval Air Station.\u0014\n\u0014\nJapanese veterans who participated in the attack as navigators and \npilots will also pay their respects, offering flowers at the Arizona \nmemorial for the American and Japanese who died.\u0014\n\u0014\nJapan lost 185 men, mostly on dive-bombers, fighters and midget \nsubmarines.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Japanese veterans and American survivors have reconciled in the \ndecades since.\u0014\n\u0014\nJapanese dive bomber pilot Zenji Abe has apologized to American \nsurvivors for the sudden attack, ashamed his government failed to \ndeliver a declaration of war in time for the assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Japanese aviators who carried out the attack thought the \ndeclaration had already been made by the time they started bombing, \nAbe has said.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2006 The Associated Press.

But she also saw extravagance and misuse of millions of \ndollars of contributors' money, she says, prompting her to write the \nbook.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I'm not a theologian, and I'm not particularly political,\" she said \nin a press release. \"But I believe I was placed at NAMB 'for such a \ntime as this.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBranson says NAMB's culture plummeted when Reccord, the first \npresident of the agency established in a denominational restructuring \nin 1997, became an author. After his first book, ghost written by a \nmagazine editor and promoted by NAMB staff, she says lines blurred \nbetween personal and NAMB business.\u0014\n\u0014\nReccord resigned in April after a Georgia Baptist newspaper ran an \ninvestigative article describing waste and ineffectiveness at the \nagency, but NAMB's chairman insisted Reccord was not asked to step \ndown. That effort to whitewash his leaving, Branson writes, indicates \nthat NAMB trustees are more concerned with secular criticism than \ngetting God's work done.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bob Reccord wanted to brand himself, and in a sense he has,\" she \nsays. \"His name is now right up there with Bakker and Swaggart, \nsynonymous with extravagance and self-indulgence. Unfortunately, he's \ntaken NAMB down that branding road with him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBranson worked 16 years as editing director at the Home Mission Board \nand director of marketing for NAMB, which formed in a merger of HMB \nand two other agencies. She says she left in 2004 on good terms but \nwith knowledge that mission money given sacrificially by people in \nthe pew was being misspent on perks like ice sculptures and private \njets. Unlike nearly 100 NAMB workers let go during Reccord's nine \nyears as president, she didn't sign a severance agreement promising \nnot to talk or write about her experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Reccord's starting salary was much higher than the last \npresident of the HMB, Branson writes, he branched out into writing \nand speaking for profit. Focus of the agency shifted from telling \nstories of missionaries to promoting Reccord, she says. Money was \nspent on flying Reccord and his wife to London for the premiere of \n\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and expensive vacations guised as \nexecutive retreats. Reccord funneled $3.3 million to business \nfriends, while NAMB staff was downsized. All power was vested in \nmicro-managing vice presidents, paralyzing competent staff. Decisions \nwere based on ego and power struggles instead of solid business.\u0014\n\u0014\nBranson said she doesn't want to harm NAMB. In fact, she says NAMB \nmay be one of the safest large organizations to support, because once \nburned leaders there won't likely allow the same things to happen \ntwice. She encourages church members to give even more to ministry \ncauses, but to pay closer attention to how their tithes and offerings \nare spent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there are some things large agencies, do well, like training \ninternational missionaries, she says, other tasks are handled better \nat the state or local level. She points out that out of a budget of \n$126 million, only 32 North American missionary families were fully \nfunded by NAMB.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Wouldn't it be great if we gradually stopped feeding the mega agency \ndinosaurs, possibly moving 1 percent of our giving each year from \nnational to state/association/church level--until we reduced our \nnational and international agencies to a reasonable size?\" she asks. \n\"I believe Southern Baptists could give much less than the current \n$190 million to national and international cooperative efforts and \nsee no measurable difference in advancing the Kingdom. And if that \nmoney were redirected to effective ministries, we could see a \npositive difference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen scrutinizing those who spend your mission money, she recommends: \n\"If we pay for it, we have a right to know what it cost. Salaries, \nseverance packages, buildings and anything else paid with contributor \ndollars should be public record or at least available on request, \nwith no hoops to jump through to obtain it. If any organization will \nnot tell you how they're spending your contributions, why not give to \nan organization that will?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you're not driving the bus, make sure you know who is,\" she \ncontinues. \"And be sure they're not asleep at the wheel. Check out \nthe involvement of trustees, board of directors or whoever is \nassigned to oversee the operations of paid staff. Make sure they're \nasking the hard questions and not just accepting periodic free trips \nto the agency's main headquarters.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBranson says it is difficult but not impossible to scrutinize large \nagencies. Waste and dishonesty can occur in a smaller organization, \nbut it's more easily discovered.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Statistics vary,\" she concludes. \"Exceptions abound. But the basic \nformula holds true more often than not: The extent of misuse is \ndirectly proportionate to the distance between the giver and the \nspender. And it's up to you and me to reduce the distance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBranson is a professional writer. The book is her 17th. She is also \npresident of a literary service that assists writers in preparing \ntheir books for publication.\u0014",

    "title": "SWEDEN: FAITH WITHOUT THE FIREWORKS",
    "words": "Sweden: Faith Without the Fireworks\u0014\nThe conversion of Sweden is unspectacularand for that reason most \nilluminating.\u0014\nMark Galli\u0014\n\u0014\nSweden, \"the wildest and most remote of the Scandinavian lands,\" was \nthe last Scandinavian region to be converted. The specifics of its \nconversion remain as remote and mysterious to historians as the \nland's medieval reputation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest attempts were seeming failures. Ansgar, the famous \napostle to Denmark, attempted to establish a Christian outpost as \nearly as 830, building a church in the town of Birka. But Swedes \nshowed little interest and, when Ansgar died, so apparently did the \nChristian presence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know of a second Frankish missionary who was soon forced to flee \nthe land, and a century after Ansgar's attempt, the archbishop of \nHamburg undertook a new missionwith as little success as Ansgar.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn western Sweden, things weren't much better. One ruler, Erik the \nVictorious, convertedprobably to marry the daughter of a Polish \nduke, a devout Catholic. But Erik quickly lapsed and died a pagan \naround 995.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen success did come, it came haltingly. Erik's son Olof (995-1022) \npublicly identified himself as a Christian: in one town he struck \ncoins with Christian slogans (such as \"God's Sigtuna\"), and he \nfounded a bishopric at Skara. His son Anund (c. 1022-c.1039) became \nthe first member of the family to take on a Christian name: James. \nContemporary historian Adam of Bremen called him the \"most Christian \nking of the Swedes,\" and claimed that while he reigned, Christianity \nwas \"widely diffused\" in Sweden.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot quiteunless he meant that Christians, still a small minority, \ncould be found in many areas of Sweden. Missionaries from England and \nDenmark were having limited success in towns and country. But when \nthey tried to force the issue, they ran into stiff opposition. When \nan English missionary smashed an image of Thor to demonstrate the \npower of Christ, he was instantly killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Uppsala region, even though it was ruled by King Stenkila \nChristianpaganism stubbornly held its ground. The local capital of \npaganism was the temple in Uppsala, which Adam of Bremen described: \n\"It is situated on level ground, surrounded by mountains. A large \ntree with spreading branches stands near the temple. There is also a \nspring nearby where the heathens make human sacrifices. A golden \nchain completely surrounds the temple, and its roof, too, is covered \nwith gold.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe temple housed three godsThor flanked by Odin and Freyto which \npriests offered sacrifices. Every nine years, a major ceremony was \nheld, with people from all the Swedish provinces bringing sacrifices. \nAccording to Adam, \"the most distressing feature of this festival is \nthat Christians too participate in the sacrifices . Animals and \nhumans alike are sacrificed,and their bodies are hung in the trees of \na sacred grove that is adjacent to the temple.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 1060 King Stenkil made Adalward (\"the younger\") bishop at \nSigtuna. Adalward, an enthusiastic evangelist, traveled about the \ncountryside smashing idols and winning many converts. But when he and \nanother bishop concocted a plan to finish off the opposition by \nburning down the great pagan temple at Uppsala, Stenkil dissuaded \nthem, feeling that the pagan backlash would hurt the Christian cause \n(see \"The Limits of Power Evangelism,\" page 33).\u0014\n\u0014\nStenkil's judgment appears to have been correct. A few years later \n(1080), when his successor King Inge I tried to forcibly end the \npagan cult at Uppsala, he was promptly expelled and replaced by his \nbrother-in-law,Sweyn. Though a Christian, Sweyn agreed to permit \npagan worship (and thus earned the nickname, \"the sacrificer\"). It \nwasn't until Inge gathered an army, defeated Sweyn, and imposed \nChristianity in the region that public pagan rituals at Uppsala ended \n(in about 1110)though they continued privately for generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many decades, if not centuries, such syncretism prevailed. \nPolytheism was not adverse to permitting another god into its \npantheon. Pagan Vikings had sent offerings of thanks to Saint Germain \nnear Paris and to Saint Patrickin Ireland for successful raids. \nBefore one important battle, a Swedish Viking army in Courland cast \nlots and determined that Christ was the god who would help. When they \nwon, they gave thanks by fasting for 47 days in Christ's namewith no \nthought of converting.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many instances, though, the pagan past made possible the Christian \nfuture. One story goes that in Gotland (an island off of eastern \nSweden), Botair of Akubekk built a Christian church. When pagans \nburned it down, he built a second, under a cliff by the shore where \npagans sacrificed to their gods. When pagans threatened to burn it as \nwell, Botair locked himself inside and said, \"If you burn it down, \nyou shall burn me with it.\" His father-in-law joined him, adding, \"Do \nnot burn down the church. It stands on sacred ground.\" The \nfather-in-law's reasoning seems to have won the day: the church \nremained intact.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly church politics played a role in Sweden's conversion (in \n1164 Uppsala was named an archbishopric), as did key martyrdoms (in \n1160, Erik IX was killed by rebelling nobles and his shrine \nflourished). But overall, only through many failures and by much \nperseverance, sustained over many generations, did \"wild and remote\" \nSweden submit to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Galli is editor of Christian History.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1999 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "SCIENCE, FAITH AND POLITICS",
    "words": "Science, Faith and \nPolitics\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Evans\u0014\n02-08-07\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Africa comes a story of an interesting convergence of science, \nfaith and politics. The national museum in Kenya is planning to \ndisplay what is known as Turkana Boy--the skeletal remains of a young \nmale who lived during the Pleistocene age--roughly 1.6 million years \nago. It is hailed by scientists as one of the world's most famous and \nimportant fossil discoveries. Turkana Boy represents the most \ncomplete skeleton of a prehistoric human ever found.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, we must use the word \"human\" advisedly. Turkana Boy is \nregarded by paleontologists as just one step in the evolution of \nhuman beings. Turkana Boy is classified as \"homo erectus,\" because he \nwalked erect, but not \"homo sapiens,\" or modern human. There are \nnoticeable differences in skull shape and size, as well as other \ndifferences. He is clearly not an ape, but he is not human in the way \nwe are either.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the science part, now for the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Boniface Adoyo is the head of Kenya's 35 evangelical \ndenominations. He claims to represent 10 million members.  Like many \nevangelicals, Bishop Adoyo is committed to a literal reading of the \nBible. And if you read the Bible literally, it does not leave room \nfor human evolution. Humans were created by God on the sixth day of \ncreation, all at once and fully grown.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I did not evolve from Turkana Boy,\" Bishop Adoyo has said.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, a literal reading of the Bible leaves a good many \nquestions unanswered. For instance, the two children of Adam and Eve \nare Cain and Abel. The Bible relates that after Cain has murdered his \nbrother, he goes off to the East of Eden and finds a wife. If Cain \nand Abel are the first two children of the first humans, who did Cain \nmarry?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is but a slice of the perennial battle between faith and \nscience. And when it is just a battle of ideas, it can be \ninteresting, and even enlightening. There are many theologians who \nseek to incorporate the findings of science into their theology. And \nthere are some pretty good scientists, like evolutionary biologist \nKen Miller for instance, who bring theology to their science.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere all this breaks down, sadly, is with the influx of politics. \nAnd by politics I mean the use of power.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Adoyo has not called for a nationwide debate on the merits of \nevolutionary theories. Instead he is flexing political muscle. He is \ncalling on evangelicals to boycott the museum and has demanded that \nTurkana Boy be moved to a back room with a big warning sign that \nsays, \"Evolution is not a fact.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\nWhich is pretty much what happens in this country as well. In science \nversus faith battles across the land, the faith community lifts up \nthe Bible, declares they are right and the scientists are wrong, and \nthen you end up with a sticker on a text book that says, \"Evolution \nis just a theory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor over 500 years people of faith have been at war with people of \nscience. In nearly everyone of these contests--from whether the sun \nrevolves around the earth or to whether illness is caused by \ndemons--the faith position has proven to be incorrect.\u0014\n\u0014\nScience helps us understand how God did something; it does not remove \nGod from the process. Science may challenge narrow, literalistic \nreadings of the Bible, but it does not necessarily diminish God in \nany way. That is unless our view of God is too small.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans, a syndicated columnist, also serves as pastor of \nAuburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, Ala.\u0014",

    "words": "Florida Woman Fakes Her Death to Drive Away Church Friends\u0014\n\u0014\nBeneath a stained-glass mural of the resurrection, the choir of St. \nMichael the Archangel Catholic Church gathered Friday to mourn a \nyoung member's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people had braced for Alison Matera's passing since they learned \nof her cancer. They sat in wooden pews before a pedestal of polished \nwhite stone. Among them was a stranger who looked strangely familiar.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said she was Matera's sister. But she looked and sounded exactly \nlike Matera.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the people wondered.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas it all a trick?\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to an incident report from the Pasco County Sheriff's \nOffice, this is what happened:\u0014\n\u0014\nMatera told them about the cancer last February, after two years in \nthe choir. They were some of her closest friends, and she gave them \nfrequent updates on her treatment.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of last year, at the age of 27, she said she was giving \nup and entering hospice care. Choir members started getting calls \nfrom a hospice nurse with updates on Matera's condition. Several of \nthem noticed the same thing: The nurse's voice sounded just like \nMatera's.\u0014\n\u0014\nJan. 18, the same nurse called choir director Timothy Paquin and told \nhim Matera had died at 7:04 p.m. He spread the news and planned the \nmemorial.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after, Paquin got a call from a woman saying she was Matera's \nsister. She said Matera's body would be shipped north to her family. \nShe, too, sounded just like Matera.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaquin called the hospice. He called local funeral homes. No one had \na record of Alison Matera. But the wheels were in motion, and the \nmemorial went on.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen the so-called sister appeared, and the suspicion grew, and by \nthe end of the service the people were convinced it had been a \ncharade.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's unclear whether anyone confronted her, because no one from the \nchoir agreed to be interviewed for this story. Matera also declined \nto comment, as did the stepsister she might have impersonated.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the service, a choir member called the Sheriff's Office and \nasked for help.\u0014\n\u0014\nA deputy visited Matera's apartment in New Port Richey that night. \nShe was there. According to the report, she confessed to faking her \nsickness and death.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatera was not arrested. According to sheriff's spokesman Doug Tobin, \nshe did not commit a crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo why did she do it?\u0014\n\u0014\nShe told the deputy she has attachment problems rooted in childhood \ntrauma. Any time someone gets close, she feels the need to separate.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter she gained several close friends in the choir, she said she had \ncancer to drive them away.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it brought them closer.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said the fake death - the heartbreaking conclusion of an 11-month \nlie - was her best attempt at sparing everyone's feelings.\u0014",

    "words": "Southern Baptist News Service Attacks Gore, Discounts Global Warming\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n03-16-07\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist leaders welcomed a newspaper article quoting \nscientists who believe former Vice President Al Gore overstated the \nimmediate danger of global warming in his Oscar-winning documentary \n\"An Inconvenient Truth,\" saying it would dispel \"some--but not \nall--of the myths of catastrophic global warming.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe quote is from Wednesday's lead story in Baptist Press, the \nSouthern Baptist Convention's official news service. BP described a \nMarch 13 story in the New York Times quoting some scientists who \nregard Gore's claims in the film \"exaggerated and erroneous\" and \naccuse him of \"alarmism\" as the first of more than 60 stories and \neditorials the newspaper has published this year on global warming \nthat raises serious criticism of Gore's views on human-induced \nclimate change.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat pleased Barrett Duke, vice president for public policy and \nresearch with the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty \nCommission. He told Baptist Press few conservatives would have \nthought the New York newspaper \"would help bring out significant and \nbroad-based scientific opposition to some of the points of the \nhuman-induced climate change agenda,\" especially when preached by \n\"one of their favorite people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We've been looking at this issue for several years now out of our \ndesire to practice stewardship of the environment, to care for \ncreation, but we have not been able to find the level of consensus \nGore claims on global warming or consensus about how it will affect \nthe world,\" Duke said. \"The report is potentially very damaging to \nGore's notion of climate change, and also potentially damaging \npersonally, to his credibility.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Times article says Gore has strong support among leading \nscientists, who commend his effort to communicate the science of \nglobal warming in language that lay people can understand. While not \na scientist, the article says, Gore relies heavily on the authority \nof science, and for that reason some scientists are sensitive to the \nfilm's details and claims.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question for most is not over Gore's central claim that man-made \nheat-trapping gases are contributing to global warming, but whether \nhis portrayal of catastrophic effects and imminent danger go beyond \nthe scientific evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nCiting no particular time frame, for example, Gore envisions sea \nlevels rising up to 20 feet and depicts parts of New York, Florida \nand other heavily populated areas sinking below the waves. The \nInternational Panel on Climate Change, which last month went further \nthan ever before in saying that human activity was the main cause of \ncurrent global warming, portrayed it as a slow-motion process, \npredicting seas in this century would rise no more than 23 inches.\u0014\n\u0014\nExperts say even small rises in sea levels could create problems of \nincreased coastal erosion, higher storm-surge flooding, loss of \nproperty and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential \nloss of life, impacts on agriculture and aquaculture and loss of \ntourism, recreation and transportation.\u0014\n\u0014\nGore's supporters in the scientific community concede \"imperfections\" \nand \"technical flaws\" in some of the film's points, but say it is \nfundamentally accurate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"On balance, he did quite well--a credible and entertaining job on a \ndifficult subject,\" Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton geoscientist who \nadvised Gore on his film and book told the New York Times. \"For that, \nhe deserves a lot of credit. If you rake him over the coals, you're \ngoing to find people who disagree. But in terms of the big picture, \nhe got it right.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Baptist Press story also quoted Wayne Grudem, research professor \nof Bible and theology at Phoenix Seminary, who said he is not \nsurprised that Gore's \"wild and unsubstantiated predictions are being \ncalled into question by a large number of scientists.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The method he uses is really a 'cherry-picking' of isolated facts to \nsupport a very dubious theory-a highly destructive dubious theory,\" \nGrudem said. \"It is one that allows the government to take our \nfreedoms and our property, or least the right to use them as we wish.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGrudem is part of the Interfaith Stewardship Alliance, a religious \ngroup that argues on its Web site that science is not settled about \nthe cause or effect of climate change and discourages Christians from \ntaking political stands without first examining what it calls \n\"biblical principles\" about God's creation and preservation of the \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrudem told Baptist Press that Gore's environmental push runs \ncontrary to what the Bible says about man's relationship to creation. \nGenesis 1:28 says he is to rule over it. It also, he said, \ncontradicts what the Bible says about God's wisdom in Proverbs \n3:19-20. \"By his wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations, by his \nunderstanding he set the heavens in place; by his knowledge the \ndepths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I find it highly doubtful that the Lord would set the earth up in \nsuch a way that we would destroy it by obeying His command,\" Grudem \nsaid. \"And yet, that's exactly what the alarmists would have us \nthink.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham of the Baptist Center for Ethics said it is \nfundamentalists who \"cherry-pick\" biblical texts to \"back up their \nanti-scientific worldview.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fundamentalists misuse the Bible when they cherry-pick texts to back \nup their anti-scientific worldview,\" he said. \"That's what Grudem has \ndone when he cites Proverbs 23 as a text that speaks against global \nwarming. Authentic Christianity believes that God created the entire \ncreated order, which Proverbs 23 underscores, and that human \nsinfulness marred and mars creation, which is what man-made global \nwarming does.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christians would do well to think theologically about their moral \nresponsibility to care for the earth and how human sinfulness, \nmanifested by greed, sloth and pride, has distorted the environment.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Genesis 1:28 uses the word 'dominion,' which fundamentalists \ntranslate as domination to justify their disregard for the \nenvironment, their greed-based desire to exploit the earth. The word \n'dominion,' however, means just rule, not endless assault. The \ndominion or rule of a good king results in justice and peace, not \nconquest.   \u0014\n\u0014\n\"From Genesis 2:15 through Exodus 20 to Psalm 24:1 through the \nprophets to Matthew 22:39 to John 3:16 through Romans, the biblical \nwitness attests to our moral obligation to protect the earth and to \nthe value God assigned to creation.  We are to be caretaker not \ncorporate raiders.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuke warned that uncritical acceptance of Gore's arguments could end \nup costing governments billions of dollars on a \"global warming \nabatement industry\" driven by fear of human-induced climate change.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Governments should be spending their money trying to protect their \npeople from the effects of global warming, rather than trying to stop \nwhat is an unavoidable part of the earth's natural cycle,\" Duke said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe BP story also argues that attempts to curb greenhouse gases will \nhurt developing countries denying them cheap and abundant fossil fuel \nthat wealthy nations used to become wealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It will condemn them to added generations of rampant disease and \nearly death,\" said Cal Beisner, co-author of the Interfaith \nStewardship Alliance study, A Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection \nof the Poor: An Evangelical Response to Global Warming. \"And that, \nconsequently, makes those policies morally hideous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeisner's paper represents one side of a rift developing among \nevangelicals over global warming. The other, a group calling itself \nThe Evangelical Climate Initiative, concludes that \"human-induced \nclimate change is real\" and that consequences of global warming will \nmost harm the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Millions of people could die in this century because of climate \nchange, most of them our poorest global neighbors,\"86 signers said in \na statement last year titled Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to \nAction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate has heated up recently, with evangelical leaders including \nJames Dobson and Rick Scarborough calling on the National Association \nof Evangelicals to remove a staff member they blame for dividing \nconservative Christians over global warming.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoral Majority founder Jerry Falwell, who has worked for decades to \ninvolve conservative Christians in politics, said recently the debate \nover global warming is a tool of Satan being used to distract \nchurches from their primary focus of preaching the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nParham suggested opposition to Gore from the Religious Right is \nmotivated by politics and the critics' problem is they read from a \n\"small Bible, which emphasizes a few moral issues while ignoring \nlarger issues like poverty and creation care.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"From Falwell to SBC fundamentalists, there is an unfathomable fear \nand visceral loathing of Al Gore and his work on global warming,\" he \nsaid. \"Like Terri Schiavo, intelligent design and the Iraqi war, \ntheir fear blocks them from seeing the facts and their anger chokes \noff their hearing of the big Bible's message.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "SAM HARRIS: ENTHUSIASTIC ATHEIST",
    "words": "In the tradition of Voltaire, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Bertrand \nRussell, Sam Harris, a graduate in philosophy from Stanford \nUniversity, has been battering at the walls of religious faith, \nespecially Christianity and Islam. His first book, The End of Faith \n(2004), was a New York Times bestseller. Predictably, he received a \ntorrent of argumentative mail from Christians and promptly decided to \nwrite another book, Letter to a Christian Nation (2006). The aim of \nthis second volume, he says, is quite simply \"to demolish the moral \nand intellectual pretensions of Christianity in its most committed \nforms.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis has been tried before, of course. After Voltaire predicted that \nChristianity would be extinct within 100 years of his death, his \nestate became a Bible Society headquarters. It is true that Europe, \non the whole, has marginalized religious faith. But in the United \nStates, nearly 90 percent of the population regularly professes \nbelief in God or a higher power. To Harris's evident irritation, 35 \npercent also believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, 46 percent in a \nliteralist view of the creation in Genesis, and 40 percent in Jesus \nChrist's return to judge the world within the next 50 years. Harris \nbelieves that this mindset constitutes a \"moral and intellectual \nemergency.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther, Harris believes that religious faith of any kind constitutes \ntotal abandonment of the normal rules of evidence. That might not \nmatter much, he says, if the dominant religious view were that of \nJainism, an Indian faith that has traditionally stressed nonviolence. \nBut Harris blames mainstream faiths in the West, such as \nChristianity, for most manmade horrors, from the Inquisition to \nHitler's death camps. (Hitler, he asserts, citing a 1922 speech, was \na Christian, and the Final Solution was inextricably linked with \nChristianity. Many historians, of course, would dispute Harris's \nreading.) In The End of Faith, Harris claims that anti-Semitism \"is \nas integral to church doctrine as the flying buttress is to a Gothic \ncathedral.\" Harris portrays Christianity in both books not just as \nfoolish, but as dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Harris is much rougher on Islam. He cites at great length some of \nthe most bloodthirsty verses from the Qur'an, suggesting that anyone \nwho can read such verses \"and still not see a link between Muslim \nfaith and Muslim violence should probably consult a neurologist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam, Harris says, \"more than any other religion human beings have \ndevised, has all the makings of a thoroughgoing cult of death.\" From \nthis position of flat-out hostility to Islam, Harris goes on to \nexcoriate cultural relativists and long-time icons of the liberal \nintelligentsia such as the late professor Edward Said of Columbia \nUniversity. Harris skewers Saidand fellow leftist Noam Chomsky as \nwellfor completely failing to grasp the core wickedness of Al Qaeda. \nHarris also takes on moral relativism, the New Age, and even pacifism.\u0014\n\u0014\nUndefined Categories\u0014\nBut in bandying about terms such as \"ethical,\" \"moral,\" and even \n\"sacred\" without defining them, Harris seems to contradict himself. \nUse of moral categories implies genuine moral free will. But Harris \nseems unable to use these values-laden terms when referring to the \nunfortunates who inhabit America's death rows. The only reasons these \npeople are there, he says, are \"bad genes, bad parents, bad ideas, or \nbad luck.\" If that's true, why use terms like \"unethical\" or \n\"immoral\" for any human behavior?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile claiming that atheism is an intellectually superior approach to \nlife, Harris denies that it is a philosophy. He glosses over the \nwicked acts of atheistic regimes such as Stalin's Russia and Mao's \nChina. In fact, Harris dismisses Communism as \"little more than a \npolitical religion,\" as if this makes the murders and enslavement of \ntens of millions of victims under the aegis of scientific atheism \nmore palatable.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe End of Faith is, as one British review approvingly noted, a \n\"rallying cry for a more ruthless secularization of society,\" so one \nis thankful that Harris is favorable toward nonviolence. Atheism, \nwhen in power, has displayed a ruthless habit of suppressing \nreligious points of view. One hopes that what Harris has in mind is \nindeed persuasion, not suppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Aikman, a CT columnist, is an author and foreign-policy \nconsultant.\u0014",

Surely he has borne our infirmities and \ncarried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by \nGod, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, \ncrushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us \nwhole, and by his bruises we are healed.\u0014\nIsaiah 53:3-5 (NRSV)\u0014\n\u0014\nTHERE IS GOOD biblical evidence that God not only suffered in Christ, \nbut that God in Christ suffers with his people still.  It is \nwonderful that we may share in Christ's sufferings; it is more \nwonderful still that he shares in ours.\u0014\nJohn R. W. Stott, The Cross of Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nHAS NOT GOD in Jesus Christ become radically open to the life of the \nworld and become vulnerable to human sin and suffering? In the light \nof the gospel story, God is not impassible, but passionate, suffering \nlove. If God is love, then receptivity, vulnerability, and suffering \nare not strange to God's being. God is free to love and thus free to \nexperience the suffering of the world.\u0014\nDaniel L. Migliore, The Power of God\u0014\n\u0014\nUNLESS GOD is on the balance and throws his weight as a \ncounterbalance, we shall sink to the bottom of the scale. If it is \nnot true that God died for us, but only a man died, we are lost. But \nif God's death and God lie dead in the opposite scale, then his side \ngoes down and we go upward like a light or empty pan. But he could \nnot have sat in the pan unless he became a man like us, so that it \ncould be said: God dead, God's passion, God's blood, God's death.\u0014\nMartin Luther, quoted in the Formula of Concord\u0014\n\u0014\nIT IS A GOOD THING to learn early that God and suffering are not \nopposites but rather one and the same thing and necessarily so; for \nme, the idea that God himself suffers is far and away the most \nconvincing piece of Christian doctrine.\u0014\nDietrich Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison\u0014\n\u0014\nGOD not only participates in our suffering, but also makes our \nsuffering into his own and takes death into his life.\u0014\nJurgen Moltmann, in Theology Today\u0014\n\u0014\nA THEOLOGY that embraces the idea that God cannot suffer has to \nanswer the question: Can God love?

    "words": "\"Friends are God's way of taking care of us.\" \u0014\nThis was written by a Metro Denver Hospice Physician:\u0014\n\u0014\nI was driving home from a meeting this evening about 5, stuck in \ntraffic on Colorado Blvd., and the car started to choke and splutter \nand die - I barely managed to coast, cursing, into a gas station, \nglad only that I would not be blocking traffic and would have a \nsomewhat warm spot to wait for the tow truck. It wouldn't even turn \nover. Before I could make the call, I saw a woman walking out of the \n\"quickie mart \" building, and it looked like she slipped on some ice \nand fell into a Gas pump, so I got out to see if she was okay \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I got there, it looked more like she had been overcome by sobs \nthan that she had fallen; she was a young woman who looked really \nhaggard with dark circles under her eyes. She dropped something as I \nhelped her up, and I picked it up to give it to her. It was a nickel. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt that moment, everything came into focus for me: the crying woman, \nthe ancient Suburban crammed full of stuff with 3 kids in the back (1 \nin a car seat), and the gas pump reading $4.95.\u0014\n\u0014\nI asked her if she was okay and if she needed help, and she just kept \nsaying \" don't want my kids to see me crying,\" so we stood on the \nother side of the pump from her car. She said she was driving to \nCalifornia and that things were very hard for her right now. So I \nasked, \"And you were praying?\" That made her back a away ay from me a \nlittle, but I assured her I was not a crazy person and said, \"He \nheard you, and He sent me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI took out my card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump \nso she could fill up her car completely, and while it was fuelling, \nwalked to the next door McDonald's and bought 2 big bags of food, \nsome gift certificates for more, and a big cup of coffee. She gave \nthe food to the kids in the \u0014\ncar, who attacked it like wolves, and we stood by the pump eating \nfries and talking a little. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe told me her name, and that she lived in Kansas City. Her \nboyfriend left 2 months ago and she had not been able to make ends \nmeet. She knew she wouldn't have money to pay rent Jan 1, and finally \nin desperation had finally called her parents, with whom she had not \nspoken in about 5 years. They lived in California and said she could \ncome live with them and try to get on her feet there. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo she packed up everything she owned in the car. She told the kids \nthey were going to California for Christmas, but not that they were \ngoing to live there. \u0014\n\u0014\nI gave her my gloves, a little hug and said a quick prayer with her \nfor safety on the road. As I was walking over to my car, she said, \n\"So, are you like an angel or something?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis definitely made me cry. I said, \"Sweetie, at this time of year \nangels are really busy, so sometimes God uses regular people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was so incredible to be a part of someone else's miracle. And of \ncourse, you guessed it, when I got in my car it started right away \nand got me home with no problem. I'll put it in the shop tomorrow to \ncheck, but I suspect the mechanic won't find anything wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the angels fly close enough to you that you can hear the \nflutter of their wings...\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalms 55:22 \"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain \nthee. He shall never suffer the righ teous to be moved.\"\u0014",

    "title": "STONEWALL JACKSON - BY DONALD DAVIS, A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "This reverential biography of Jackson is the latest in Palgrave's \nGreat Generals series, but it's not as concise as its slim volume \nmight suggest. An obscureinstructor at Virginia Military Institute, \nJackson was approaching middle age when he joined Confederate forces \nat the outbreak of the Civil War. He acquired his nickname, \nStonewall, after an admirable stand at the first Battle of Bull Run. \nTransferred to nearby Shenandoah Valley, he made headlines as far \naway as Europe with a brilliant, fast-moving campaign that befuddled \nfar larger Union forces. He returned to the main body of Lee's \ncommand, where his crushing assault was a crucial victory in the \nsecond Battle of Bull Run, followed by his legendary flank attack \nthat routed Union forces at Chancellorsville. Author Davis (Lightning \nStrike) dutifully relates Jackson's unlegendary generalship on the \nPeninsula and at Fredericksburg, but like many Confederate hero \nbiographers, his unrestrained admiration leads to purple prose (The \nblue eyes of Stonewall Jackson again blazed with excitement). Those \nseeking more insight into Jackson will find Byron Farwell's 1992 \nbiography longer, but more rewarding. (Sept.) \u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved. \u0014\n\u0014\nReview\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Davis' exceptional biography of Stonewall Jackson breathes new life \ninto the Civil War legend and his Foot Cavalry. Davis deftly reveals \nthe relevance today of the man who created a textbook on tactics by \naccomplishing so much, so often, with so little.\"--Jack Coughlin, \nGunnery Sergeant, USMC (Ret.), and New York Times bestselling author \nof SHOOTER: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper \u0014\n\"Davis, whose diverse background includes experience in almost every \nphase of publishing as well as a profound knowledge of military \nhistory, brings to Stonewall a deft touch that makes this compelling \nsubject new, exciting and exceptionally readable. The result is an \nenthralling portrayal of the man many believe may have been the top \nmilitary strategist of his time.\" --Ken Englade, author of The Tony \nHillermans Frontier series. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"A brilliant masterpiece. Former CIA Director Allen Dulles once said, \n'truth has a hard time once legends are established to appease our \nthirst for heroes.' Don Davis has captured the truth about General \nThomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. In this book, readers will find precious \nlessons in strategy, tactics, character and honor -- traits and skill \nsets that never disappear.\"--Fred Burton, Vice-President, STRATFOR \nand former U.S. Counterterrorism agent \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Confederate General Thomas Jackson inspired the best nickname of the \nCivil War. Condensing everything about Stonewall into this brief \nbiography, Davis ensures inclusion of sections of Jackson's career in \ncommand that are not regarded, as his campaign of 1862 in the \nShenandoah Valley universally is, as militarily brilliant. First, \nDavis seeks to combat traits of the general--imperturbability and \nrelentlessness--in the boy growing up. Naturally taciturn and \naccustomed to premature deaths in the family, the hard-studying \nJackson presented a brusque face to the world and made enemies more \neasily than friends. But the moment met the man in July 1861, as the \nslave-owning Jackson saved the day for the South and acquired his \nmoniker at the Battle of Bull Run. In narrating Jackson's succession \nof victories, Davis criticizes his performance at the Seven Days \nbattles of 1862 but not that at 1863's Battle of Chancellorsville, in \nwhich he was killed by accident by his men, beginning undying \nspeculation on how the South might have won had he lived. This rapid \nread ably introduces the famous warrior.\"--Booklist \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Brisk entry in Palgrave's Great Generals series spotlights the \nbattle prowess of Dixie's warrior-saint......a handy introduction to \nthe military genius.\"--Kirkus \u0014\n\u0014\n\"[Davis] offers insightful analyses of Jackson's tendencies and \nbehavior.\"--Matthew J.

    "title": "STILL REELING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS",
    "words": "January 1, 2008, The New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nStill Reeling After All These Years\u0014\nBy BOB HERBERT\u0014\n\u0014\nIt promised to be a very good year. But then anything would be better \nthan 1967, with its angry kids burning the flag, and the war raging, \nand American cities going up in flames one after another.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Page 1 headline in The New York Times said: World Bids Adieu to a \nViolent Year.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems impossible that 1968, the most incredible year of a most \nincredible decade, was 40 years ago. As the new year tiptoed in, \nAmericans wrapped themselves as usual in the comfort of optimism. \nSnow fell on the revelers in Times Square. A threatened New York City \nsubway strike was averted and the 20-cent fare maintained.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one had a clue about what was in store. A friend of mine, looking \nback, said, Sixty-eight was the whirlwind.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a presidential election year, and The Times reported on Jan. 1 \nthat G.O.P. leaders believed that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York \nwas the only Republican who could defeat Lyndon Johnson. Richard \nNixon might give the president a good run, they said, but would \nprobably lose. Ronald Reagan and the governor of Michigan, George \nRomney, would most likely lose decisively.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sound of Music and Thoroughly Modern Millie were hit movies, \nboth starring Julie Andrews. Hello Dolly and Fiddler on the Roof \nwere on Broadway. Ladies nylons at Gimbels were 88 cents a pair, and \nmens dress shirts at Bloomingdales were three for $14.75.\u0014\n\u0014\nRock n roll, drugs and long-haired young people who considered \nthemselves hip were ubiquitous. But it was still a pretty innocent \ntime. That would change.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the astonishing things about 1968 was how quickly each \nshocking, consciousness-altering event succeeded the last, leaving no \ntime for people to reorient themselves. The mind-boggling occurrences \nseemed to come out of nowhere, like the Viet Cong who set off a depth \ncharge beneath the Johnson presidency with the Tet offensive at the \nend of January.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Walter Cronkite learned of the coordinated wave of attacks \nthroughout South Vietnam by the Cong and North Vietnamese regulars he \nis reported to have said: What the hell is going on? I thought we \nwere winning this war.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nation shuddered. The U.S. had never lost a war, but now men \npadding around in black pajamas and flip-flops fashioned from \ndiscarded tires gave every appearance of battling the mightiest \nmilitary on earth to a stalemate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Hampshire primary was March 12. Eugene McCarthy, a quiet, \ncerebral and sometimes flaky senator from Minnesota who was calling \nfor a negotiated settlement of the war, electrified the country and \nexposed the presidents political vulnerability by finishing second \nwith 42 percent of the vote.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin days, Bobby Kennedy, who had only recently said he could see \nno circumstances in which he would challenge Johnson, was challenging \nhim. McCarthy was furious. Johnson was traumatized.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of the month, Johnson had abandoned the race.\u0014\n\u0014\nEuphoria reigned  among young people, and those opposed to the war, \nand those who believed that ordinary people of good will could change \nthe world. For many, it was the peak moment of the 1960s.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt lasted just four days.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 3, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed \nin Memphis. Violence erupted in dozens of cities, and especially in \nWashington, where a number of people were killed and the fires were \nthe worst the city had experienced since the British took the torch \nto it in 1814.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn J. Lindsay of Newsweek magazine said that when Bobby Kennedy was \ntold that King had died, he put his hands to his face and murmured: \nOh, God. When is this violence going to stop?\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy himself was murdered two months later. I remember people not \nknowing what to say. The madness had been unleashed, and there seemed \nno way to rein it in.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was much more to come, more war, the orgy of police violence at \nthe Democratic convention in Chicago, the razor-thin election of \nRichard Nixon and Spiro Agnew over Hubert Humphrey and Edmund Muskie \nin November.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut an awful lot of people tuned out after Kennedy was killed. That \nseemed to be when, for so many, the hope finally died. The nation has \nnever really recovered from the bullet that killed R.F.K.\u0014\n\u0014\nArthur Schlesinger, in his biography of Kennedy, quotes Richard \nHarwood of The Washington Post:\u0014\n\u0014\nWe discovered in 1968 this deep, almost mystical bond that existed \nbetween Robert Kennedy and the Other America. It was a disquieting \nexperience for reporters. ... We were forced to recognize in Watts \nand Gary and Chimney Rock that the real stake in the American \npolitical process involves not the fate of speechwriters and \nfund-raisers, but the lives of millions of people seeking hope out of \ndespair.\u0014",

He has described the war in Iraq as \"the preeminent \nmoral issue of our time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Congressman Lee Hamilton, co-chair of the 9/11 Commission, \ncalled the study a \"very valuable public service.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I hope the lesson that arises, that comes from all this report, is \nthat all of us have to be more skeptical of statements made by our \npublic leaders and scrutinize those statements with very great care,\" \nHamilton said in a YouTube interview with Bill Buzenberg, executive \ndirector of the Center for Public Integrity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHamilton said he thinks public opinion was manipulated in the lead-up \nto war. \"A lot of statements were made by high-level officials which \nwere not accurate,\" he said. \"That could have been intentional, or it \nmight have been unintentional. There's no doubt in my mind the \npresident wanted to go to war, no doubt in my mind that his \nadministration basically wanted to go to war.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think probably many of these public officials believed what they \nwere saying, but the fact of the matter is what they were saying was \nnot true,\" he said. \"And in that sense they certainly manipulated \npublic opinion towards support of the war.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHamilton said the media \"became cheerleaders in support of the war\" \nand Congress was \"timid.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't think the media performed their job well at all, because \ntheir job is to be skeptical,\" he said. \"Their job is to look at the \nstatement any public official makes and tear it apart, find out if \nit's true or not, and they didn't do that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHamilton said Congress also failed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have been critical of the president for leading us into this war, \nbut the criticism goes equally to the Congress,\" he said. \"They had \nthe same information the president had. They didn't ask the tough \nquestions. They didn't think about it, and the resolution that they \npassed was a resolution that said in effect, after citing all of the \nfalse evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, the resolution \nsaid, 'Mr. President, it's your problem.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was a default on the part of the Congress of their responsibility \nas a co-equal, separate, independent branch of government,\" he said. \n\"The Congress just didn't do its job.\"\u0014",

When asked if she \npreached from the Bible, Truth said no, because she couldn't read.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I preaches,\" she said, \"I has just one text to preach from, an' \nI always preaches from this one.

She made her way \nto the home of Issac and Maria Van Wagenerwhose home she said God \nshowed her in a vision. The Quaker couple bought her from Dumont and \nthen freed her.\u0014\n\u0014\nA couple of years later, she had an experience that solidified her \nemerging faith. According to her dictated autobiography, one day \"God \nrevealed himself to her, with all the suddenness of a flash of \nlightning, showing her, 'in the twinkling of an eye, that he was all \nover,' that he pervaded the universe, 'and that there was no place \nwhere God was not.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I jes' walked round an' round in a dream,\" the former slave later \ntold Stowe. \"Jesus loved me! I knowed it, I felt it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring her early years, though, her faith was confused, and at one \npoint she joined a cult whose leader eventually murdered one of the \nmembers; for another period, she followed the Millerites, who \npredicted Christ would return in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nWanting to make a fresh start, Isabella asked God for a new name. \nAgain she had a visionGod renamed her Sojourner \"because I was to \ntravel up an' down the land, showin' the people their sins, an' bein' \na sign unto them.\" She soon asked God for a second name, \"'cause \neverybody else had two names; and the Lord gave me Truth, because I \nwas to declare the truth to the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this new mission, she left New York and traveled throughout New \nEngland, attending local prayer meetings and others she called on her \nown. In 1850 she published her autobiography, written with Olive \nGilbert. It brought her fame, and with that fame came harassment. \nWhen she was once told the building she was to speak in would be \nburned if she preached, she replied, \"Then I will speak to the \nashes.\" Her quick wit and determination were only successful to a \npoint. After being physically assaulted by one particularly vicious \nmob, she was forced to walk with a cane for the rest of her life.\u0014\nIt was against slavery that the former slave made her most virulent \nattacks. But she was also a woman, and once she met other female \nabolitionists, she became an avid supporter of women's rights as \nwell. For many northerners, this was even more controversial than her \nabolitionist preaching. Some tried to stop her from speaking at a \nWomen's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851they feared it \nwould weaken the abolitionist movement. But Truth spoke anyway, \ndelivering her most famous speech:\u0014\n\u0014\n    That man over there says that women need to be helped into \ncarriages and lifted over ditches and to have the best place \neverywhere. Nobody helps me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look \nat me! Look at my arm. I have plowed, I have planted, and I have \ngathered into barns. And no man could head me. And ain't I a woman? I \ncould work as much and eat as much as manwhen I could get itand \nbear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne children and \nseen most of them sold into slavery, and when I cried out with a \nmother's grief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of the Civil War, Truth had met with Abraham Lincoln, had \nher arm dislocated by a racist streetcar conductor, petitioned the \ngovernment to make western lands available to freed blacks, and made \ncountless speeches on behalf of African Americans and women. In 1875, \nshe retired to her home in Battle Creek, Michigan, where she remained \nuntil her death.\u0014",

Seminary President Discusses Sin, Death and \nMosquitoes\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen, 08-08-08 \u0014\n\u0014\nThere may have been mosquitoes in the Garden of Eden, says a Southern \nBaptist seminary president, but they didn't become a pest until after \nAdam and Eve committed Original Sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn \"Ask Anything Wednesday\" of his daily radio program, Albert \nMohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in \nLouisville, Ky., fielded a question Aug. 6 from a young girl sent in \nby her mother: \"Did God make mosquitoes before Adam sinned, and if \nso, what did they eat?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That is a very, very interesting question, and yet it is a question \nI think we can answer,\" Mohler said. \"Did mosquitoes exist? Yes. In \nother words when you start working through the days of creation, it's \nclear that God created all the different orders of the animals and \nall the different orders of nature, and that would include the bugs, \nthe insects and other things that we have to scratch our heads and \nwonder how God's glory is in them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In other words, we know that God's glory is in the mosquito, but \nwhen it's biting on your arm or when it's transmitting a disease it's \nhard to see,\" he continued. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor Mohler, who has a Ph.D. in systematic and historical theology at \nSouthern Seminary, \"the question of the mosquito\" is the \"same as the \nquestion of the tiger, the lion, the bear or any other carnivore or \nanything else that preys on any other being.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"After the fall, we are told that when sin entered, so also entered \ndeath. When death entered, all of a sudden the tiger developed a \ntaste for blood, for flesh, and it became a predator. Its predatory \nbehavior is a sign of the fall, of the effect of sin, of nature \nturning hostile. That's why one of the pictures of the Kingdom of God \nthat is produced by the gospel is of the lion and the lamb together, \nwhere the lion has lost its taste for flesh. It no longer wants the \nblood of the lamb. It's a beautiful picture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And to this little girl I'd just simply want to say, before Adam \nfell, evidently the mosquito had no taste for blood,\" he continued. \n\"But after the fall, as a sign of the curse, of the awful sinfulness \nof sin, the mosquito's diet changed. What did they eat before? That I \ndon't know, but something that did not represent death.\"\u0014",

Jaworski was a Presbyterian elder, and one Sunday he \nfound himself at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, the \nhistoric Washington church where Peter Marshall had been pastor. As \nhe sat in worship, he noted the Lincoln pew, which is set aside in \nthat church for presidents to sit in when they visit there for \nworship, and it's the pew in which Lincoln sat during the Civil War \nyears when he came to church. Suddenly there was a hush in the \ncongregation, and down the aisle walked Mr. Nixon with an usher who \nseated him in the Lincoln pew. Leon Jaworski, sitting several pews \nbehind that pew, recollected in his mind all that he knew from having \nlistened to the Nixon tapes. He knew that the president could be \nindicted for criminal activity beyond any shadow of doubt. There he \nsat in worship. He wondered in his own mind what would happen if the \npresident suddenly stood up and said to the pastor of the church, who \nwas Dr. George M. Docherty at the time, Dr. Docherty, I would like a \nmoment of special privilege, and then would turn to the congregation \nand say:\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to say today that, as president of the United States, I have \nsinned before God and I have lied to you. I have asked his \nforgiveness and I now ask yours. I have come to this church today to \nmake full disclosure of who and what I am and what I have become. I \npromise you from this day forward I'm going to do better.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeon Jaworski said if he had done that as he had turned it in his \nmind, we would have probably gathered the president up and put him on \nour shoulders and carried him back to the White House.

In fact, some theologians fear the concept of personal sin is \nalmost lost.\u0014\nWhen Pope Benedict XVI said at Easter that in the contemporary world, \n\"the notion of sin\" is jeopardized, he got some amens from Protestant \npastors as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresbyterian Tim Keller still preaches about sin, but with lots of \nexplanation \"because the word is essentially obsolete,\" Keller says. \nHis three New York City congregations are mostly young and single. \n\"They do get the idea of branding, of taking a word or term and \nfilling it with your own content, so I have to rebrand the word sin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne starting place is what qualifies as sin these days. A survey by \nEllison Research shows that 87 percent of U.S. adults still \nacknowledge the concept of sin, but what is \"almost always wrong\" is \nchanging:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tCheating on your spouse? Wrong. (81% call it a sin.) \u0014\n\tSex before marriage? Not so wrong (45%) \u0014\n\tRacism? Wrong. (74%) \u0014\n\tGambling? Hardly wrong at all. (30%) \u0014\n\u0014\nOf his Manhattan setting Keller says, \"Around here [sin] means \nself-centeredness, the acorn from which it all grows. Individually, \nthat means 'I live for myself, for my own glory and happiness, \ntearing the net of interwovenness, the fabric of humanity.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo sin, as a list of acts offensive to God first and foremost, is \ndifficult to sell.

If you would read Stephens\u0014\nwhole sermon with care, however, you would realize that it was not the\u0014\nlength of the sermon but rather its content that so enraged the \ncouncil of\u0014\nthe religious leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nStephen put his life and his ministry on the line in this sermon, and\u0014\nthe prophetic word he announces to those who obviously receive it \nbadly.\u0014\nIt takes great courage to speak out in the fashion that Stephen did.\u0014\n\u0014\nStephens courage reminds me of a story I once heard about Nikita\u0014\nKhrushchev, former premier of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev\u0014\ndenounced many of Joseph Stalins policies and atrocities. Once, as he\u0014\ncensured Stalin in a public meeting, Khrushchev was interrupted by a\u0014\nshout from a heckler in the audience. You were one of Stalins \ncolleagues.\u0014\nWhy didnt you stop him?\u0014\n\u0014\nWho said that? roared Khrushchev. An agonizing silence followed as\u0014\nnobody in the room dared move a muscle. Then Khrushchev replied \nquietly,\u0014\nNow you know why (http://www.actsweb.org/encwknd3403.htm).\u0014\n\u0014\nTo do what was necessary took a great deal of nerve on Stephens part.\u0014\nAnd yet, when we consider the changes necessary in our world, it seems\u0014\nthat leaders both lead with courage and are willing to pay the \nultimate\u0014\npriceor they do not lead at all.\u0014",

    "words": "Skimming is the way many of us cope with multiple demands, constant \npressure, and overloaded schedules. We cover a lot of ground \nsuperficially without being fully engaged. Like skimming a book, this \ncan produce the impression that everything is covered, but in \nreality, you aren't completely there. How do you know you're \nskimming? \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you go from meeting to meeting without awareness of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you say yes to new commitments and expansions without \nproperly following through on what you are already doing. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen it is Friday and you realize you have not had enough time to \nallow the truth of what you are preaching to transform your own walk \nwith Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you avoid difficult decisions and truths because someone will \nbe upset. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you muddle your way through a meeting because you have not \nclearly determined your goals and agenda. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you make a pastoral phone call or visit  resentfully. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you cannot stop thinking about the unfinished work at church \nwhen you are with your family. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you are too busy to reflect on your own heart or cultivate \nyour own personal relationship with Jesus Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you are not investing in your own personal growth and \nmarriage. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you measure your success based on what other people say rather \nthan your own internal values before God.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany times skimming is a \"defensive mechanism\" of denial that blocks \nus from growing up spiritually and emotionally. It's a way of \navoiding aspects of ministry that stir up anxiety or pain. It can \nwork for a while, but eventually it catches up with us, and there's a \nprice to pay.\u0014\n\u0014\nPete Scazzero, pastor\u0014",

    "words": "When did the cross supplant the ichthus \n(fish) as a symbol of the Christian faith? \u0014\n                                                            by \nEverett Ferguson | posted 2/26/2009 \u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Christians used a wide variety of symbols to express their \nfaith. The second-century Christian teacher Clement of Alexandria \nidentified a dove, a fish, a ship, a lyre, and an anchor as suitable \nimages to be engraved on Christians' signet-rings (or seals). \nArchaeologists have discovered a gold finger-ring from the third or \nfourth century that depicts an anchor, cross, lamb, shepherd, dove, \nand the abbreviation for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the best known early Christian symbols, because of its modern \nrevival, is the fish. Some early Christians made the Greek word for \nfish, ichthus, into an acronym for \"Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior.\" \n(See \"The Original Christian Bumper Sticker\" by Collin Hansen.) \nTertullian, a theologian writing at beginning of the third century, \ninterpreted this practice as a symbol of baptism: \"But we small \nfishes, named after our great ICHTHUS, Jesus Christ, are born in \nwater and only by remaining in water can we live.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe symbol of the anchor, with its crossbar, resembles a cross. An \nanchor and two fish (probably from the third century) occur together \non a grave slab in the catacomb of Domitilla in Rome. (Read more \nabout the anchor as a Christian symbol here.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWritings from the early church show how central the cross was to \nChristian preaching and confession. Moreover, Justin Martyr, a \nChristian apologist writing in the 150s160s, argued that God had \nprovidentially put the shape of the cross in everyday objects, such \nas the masts of ships, tools like the plough and the axe, and the \nstandards of Roman legions. Christians would often pray standing up \nwith their arms stretched out in the form of a cross. As early as the \n200s, Christians were making the sign of the cross with their hands. \nThe cross was so important that pagans charged Christians with \nworshipping the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Christians took two abbreviations that occurred in \nnon-Christian writings and gave them special meaning. The Greek \nletter tau (which looks like a plus sign or a T-shaped cross), with \nthe vertical bar curled at the top to represent the letter rho (which \nlooks like a P), was an abbreviation for words beginning tr. The \ntau-rho occurs in Christian writings dated 175 to 225 in the spelling \nof the Greek words for \"cross\" (stauros) and \"crucify\" (stauroo). \nSince Christians saw the tau as symbolizing a cross, the superimposed \nrho may have suggested the head of Christ, making the tau-rho the \nfirst visual representation of the crucifixion by Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second abbreviation Christians used was the chi-rho monogram, \ncomposed of the Greek letter chi (which has the shape of an X) \nintersected by the letter rho. It appears in Christian writings as an \nabbreviation for Christ (Christos). In 312, according to the early \nChristian writer Lactantius, Emperor Constantine had the chi-rho \nmarked on his soldiers' shields as they marched on Rome; according to \nEusebius, he had the emblem put on a military standard.  After \nConstantine's victory, the chi-rho cross, often combined with the \nletters alpha and omega, became the ubiquitous symbol of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians did not make explicit pictures of the crucifixion for \nabout 400 years after Christ's death. There are various possible \nexplanations for this. A theological reason may be that the early \nChristians emphasized the resurrection as well as the crucifixion. \n(The Romans crucified many people, but only one was resurrected. \nAllusions to the resurrection in early Christian art were also \nrelatively rare but earlier than depictions of the crucifixion.) A \nmore practical reason may be that Constantine's influence so \nestablished the chi-rho that no alternative symbol was necessary. It \nfunctioned very much like a bare cross does today as an identifying \nmarker of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverett Ferguson is professor of church history emeritus at Abilene \nChristian University and a member of the Christian History advisory \nboard.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2009 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.\u0014",

Its purpose is not to convey \nscientific information but to transform hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, \nbelieve that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of \nmodern science may comfortably co-exist. We believe that the theory \nof evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood \nup to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and \nachievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as 'one theory \namong others' is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and \ntransmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's \ngood gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the \nfailure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our \ncreator. To argue that God's loving plans of salvation for humanity \npreclude the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to \nattempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members \nto preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the \nteaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human \nknowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion \nremain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of \ntruth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the sort of balanced reason which this debate needs. No scare \ntactics, no political arm-twisting, simply a straightforward \naffirmation of what nearly every credible scientist knows to be the \ntruth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans is pastor of Auburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, \nAla.\u0014",

    "title": "SEVEN THINGS YOUR PASTOR WISHES YOU KNEW",
    "words": "After 33 years in the local church pastoral ministry, sitting on the \nreceiving side of the pulpit is a very different way to spend a \nSunday morning. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe transition is proving to be a provocative, illuminating and \nsobering experience. Some parts are extremely gratifying, others \ncompletely frustrating. Beyond the change in Sunday routine, I've \nbeen thinking a great deal these days about the interchange between \nclergy and laity and how to help encourage healthy conversation in \nthose relationships. \u0014\n\u0014\nI recently led a workshop called \"Seven Things Your Pastor Wishes You \nKnew But Is Afraid to Tell You.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's my list: \u0014\n\u0014\n                  It's not their fault, but your minister didn't \nlearn everything they needed in seminary to be a pastor. Like doctors \nleaving medical school, clergy need a time to do their \"residency\" \nand learn to practice in the field what they've learned in the \nclassroom. Actually, that theological education never stops. So give \nyour minister permission not to be perfect and always to be learning. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Every pastor must learn to \"choose their guilt.\" \nThere is always more to do than there is time to do it. Every \nminister must come to terms with an inherent guilt around what he or \nshe did not do today. Too often that means their own family gets the \nleftovers. By the way, this is a dilemma for all of us regardless of \nour vocation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Be kind if you have a criticism. Healthy clergy \nwelcome constructive criticism. Everyone abhors petty nitpicking. \nMake sure you engage in the former and not the latter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Have some realistic expectations for the pastor's \nfamily. How many ways can we say this? Please give your minister's \nfamily an extra measure of grace. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Err on the side of generosity. I'm not just talking \nabout money, though I am talking about money. I also mean be generous \nwith your attention, questions, interest, ability to remember family \nnames, laughter, food, jokes, invitations to ball games and your \nlife. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Your pastor loves you, but he or she may or may not \nlike you. As in your family, there are days when your spouse, child \nor parent loves you, but is frustrated by you or wondering what they \ndid to deserve you. That ambivalence is part of being human. Own it \nand expect it. \u0014\n\u0014\n               Your comfort is not your pastor's primary concern. \nHope you know this. If not, read the Bible and remind yourself why \nyour church exists in the first place. Trying to be priest \n(comforting the afflicted) and prophet (afflicting the comfortable) \nto the same people is confusing, messy and an invitation to \nmisunderstandings. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur workshop group engaged in fine conversation around each point. I \nsensed a genuine interest in doing some additional thinking along \nthese lines. I did request that the laity present tell me \"what you \nwish your pastor knew but are afraid to tell him or her.\" We'll look \nat that tomorrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

    "title": "SEVEN COMMON TRAITS OF LEADERS",
    "words": "Seven common traits of \nleaders:\u0014\n\u0014\nSince my research is more subjective than not, I don't want to \nsuggest that this list of personality characteristics is exhaustive. \nNor do I want to suggest that the order is one of a particular \npriority. But enough disclaimershere's my list:\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders are loyal. They are loyal to God, their families, \nand the places where they serve. They are loyal to friends. And their \nloyalties are intense and obvious to everyone who knows them.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders are joyous and fun. One of the main reasons that \nleaders are effective is because they have eager followers. People \nlike to follow leaders who are fun and demonstrate obvious joy in \ntheir lives. Who wants to follow a grumpy, joyless leader?\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders have a strong work ethic. In fact, one of the \ngreatest challenges of these leaders is maintaining balance. They are \nprone to be on the task 24/7.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders are self-aware. They are able to see their \nstrengths and weaknesses with a great deal of objectivity. They seek \nout critical evaluations from people they trust to tell them the \ntruth. Because they are self-aware, they are constantly seeking to \nimprove.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders take initiative. These leaders do not need to be \nprodded to complete a task. To the contrary, they go well beyond \nothers' expectations. Good managers complete an assigned task. But \ngood leaders are regularly envisioning a better way and better \nstrategy.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders love people. Some effective leaders are extroverts; \nthey are energized when they are around people. Other effective \nleaders are introverts. Put them in a crowd sharing small talk, and \nthey will be drained by the end of the day. But both types of leaders \nhave a love for people. They truly care about others. They embody \nservanthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffective leaders are tenacious. You rarely hear about them giving \nup. While others may view a setback as failure, effective leaders see \nit as an opportunity to move in another direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                           -----Tom Rainer, Lifeway\u0014",

    "title": "SPIRITUAL GIFTS -- FROM THE LIGHT SIDE",
    "words": "Spiritual Gifts\u0014\n\u0014\nFour passages in the New Testament deal with the subject of spiritual \ngifts (Eph. 4:716; 1Pet. 4:1011; Rom. 12:38, and 1 Cor. 1214). \nEach of these passages makes its own contribution to our \nunderstanding of the subject, although they have certain elements in \ncommon.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause spiritual gifts are to be used for the common good rather \nthan as a private treasure of the recipient, they might be seen as \ntools, as opposed to trophies. The difference between a tool and a \ntrophy may be seen in two kinds of car. A trophy car is one that is \nin perfect condition. Its paint is flawless, with no scratches, \npeeling, or fading. There are no stains or worn spots in the \nupholstery, and every mechanical system is in perfect working order. \nOf course, to sustain this pristine condition, the car is never \ndriven. It is parked in a clean garage and is only brought out to be \nhauled by trailer for display at trophy car shows.\u0014\n\u0014\nA work car, on the other hand, is a tool. This one may be owned by a \npainting contractor, for example. It has dents and scratchesthe \nresult of equipment sliding in and out or bumping against it. It has \nhouse paint spatters on the fenders from the times that its owner \nforgot to seal a paint can. The seats are soiled from the painter's \nclothing, dirty after a long day of labor in the sun. These two cars \nare very different in their appearance but also very different in \ntheir impact. While the trophy car may be admired for its beauty, it \nis arguably a failure, given the normal purposes for a car. The work \ncar, on the other hand, is nothing to admire in its appearance. But \nit has been put to useful service for transporting crew and equipment \nto work. God has given spiritual gifts to be used as tools, not \ntrophies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe interdependent function of the parts of the body and the \nnecessity of all to enable others to thrive might be seen in analogy \nwith a beautiful, graceful woman. Her beauty is striking, as it is \nvisible in her facial features, skin tone and complexion, thick hair, \nand the like. These features may define her beauty, but a host of \ninvisible organs are essential to the appearance one sees and \nadmires. No one is going to be attracted by her liver; no one will \ncompliment her kidneys; her thyroid will not win any beauty contests.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet apart from the good health and normal function of these organs, \nher appearance will not be beautiful. The visible parts could never \nproclaim their independence of the less honored, less glorious parts. \nAll must be in their rightful place, serving their God-intended \npurposes.Robert Vogel\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see WORD\\My Documents\\Spiritual Gifts\u0014",

    "title": "SATAN AND DEMONS",
    "words": "Isaiah 14:12. Originally created as one of God's highest angels, \npossessing all angelic attributes, Satan (Adversary) led angels in \na rebellion. He is described as the originator and chief practitioner \nof sin (1 John 3:8), that wicked one (1 John 5:18), a thief and \ndestroyer (John 10:10), a deceiver (Rev. 12:9), murderer and liar \n(John 8:44), and the accuser of the brethren (Rev. 12:10). \nIllustration: Satan's subtle nature is reflected in the first \ntemptation (Gen. 3:1), and in his titles angel of light (2 Cor. \n11:14) and him that deceiveth the whole world (Rev. 12:9). His \npresent-day activities include opposing the will and work of God, \ncounterfeiting the work of God, and destroying all that is good. \u0014\n\u0014\nApplication: A Christian can overcome Satan when he remembers four \nbasic principles: First, though Jesus is greater than the Devil (1 \nJohn 4:4), a Christian must still have a healthy respect for the \nEnemy; even the archangel Michael did not confront Satan except in \nthe name of the Lord (Jude 9). Second, a wise Christian will evaluate \nhis life and avoid those situations where he is most likely to be \ntempted (1 Thess. 5:22). Third, he should resist the Devil by \nsubmitting to God (James 4:710). Finally, the Christian should \nalways be prepared by wearing the whole armor of God (Eph. 6:1317). \n(First Reference, Is. 14:1217; Primary Reference, Is. 14:1217; cf. \n1 Tim. 4:1.)\u0014",

One of them was \nPat Buchanan, \u0014\n         who replied to my column in one of his own.\u0014\n\u0014\n           He began with a jab at the presumption of columnists who \nknow the mind\u0014\n         of God. Then he wrote: In defense of President Bush, if \nthat was his first\u0014\n         reaction to Arafat's death, it bespeaks a Christian heart. \nAs a boy in World War\u0014\n         II, I was taught by Catholic nuns that while permissible to \npray for the death\u0014\n         of Hitler or Tojo, it was impermissible to pray for their \ndamnation. That was\u0014\n         hatred, and hatred is a sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Of course, if hatred  even hatred of a Hitler or an \nArafat is a sin, then love                     \u0014\n         even love of such a monster must be a moral duty. And that \nis indeed what \u0014\n         many Christians believe. I say to you, Love your enemies \nand pray for those who \u0014\n         persecute you, Jesus is quoted in Matthew, so that you may \nbe children of your \u0014\n         Father in heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Catholics who pray the rosary implore God to lead all \nsouls to heaven, espe-\u0014\n        cially those most in need of thy mercy--especially, in other \nwords, the most\u0014\n        wicked.

To do less would be contrary to Bush's faith.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            I HAVE GREAT RESPECT for that faith and a deep \nappreciation for\u0014\n        the good that Christians and Christianity have accomplished \nin the world. But my \u0014\n        faith, Judaism, teaches a fundamentally different lesson \nabout evil and how to \u0014\n        respond to it.\u0014\n\n                                                                                                                                             \u0014\n           Jewish tradition holds, with Ecclesiastes, that there is a \ntime to love and a time to \u0014\n         hate. The Hebrew Bible enjoins us to love our neighbor \n(Leviticus 19:18)\u0014\n         and to love the stranger (Deuteronomy 10:19). but that love \nhas its limits. We are \u0014\n         not expected to love savage thugs or to ask God's mercy on \nthem. On the\u0014\n         contrary, we loathe the unrepentantly cruel because we \nbelieve that loathes them\u0014\n         too.\u0014\n\u0014\n          It defies reason and upends morality to claim that God \nloves both Saddam\u0014\n       Hussein and the innocent Kurds he gassed to death  that He \nbestows His\u0014\n       love on Osama bin Laden no less than the 3,000 souls he \nbutchered on 9/11.\u0014\n       Of course we should pray that an evildoer will realize the \nawfulness of his ways \u0014\n       and atone for his crimes. But to love him even if he doesn't? \nTo bless him when \u0014\n       he dies?God forbid! To bless the Hitlers and the Arafats of is \nworld is to betray \u0014\n       their victims. That we must never do.\u0014\n\u0014\n          That is what Elie Wiesel meant, when he visited Auschwitz \non the 50th anniversary\u0014\n       of its liberation and entreated, God of forgiveness, do not \nforgive\u0014\n       those who created this place. That is what the rabbis meant \nwhen they taught,\u0014\n       many centuries ago, that he who is merciful to the cruel will \nend up being\u0014\n       cruel to the merciful. Hate the sin but love the sinner is a \nbeautiful rule to\u0014\n       follow in most of our dealings with others. But when it comes \nto those who\u0014\n       torture and murder without qualm, who are pitiless in the pain \nthey inflict on\u0014\n       others---when it comes to such people, hatred is no sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n       This theme has been explored in the journal First Things, in a \nbrilliant essay\u0014\n      by Meir Y. Soleveichik titled The Virtue of Hate. \nSoleveichik, scion of a\u0014\n      rabbinic family, writes that in his weekly get-togethers with a \nfriend who is an\u0014\n      Episcopal priest, there was one issue on which we could never \nagree: Is an\u0014\n      utterly evil man Hitler, Stalin, Osama bin Laden  deserving of \na theist's\u0014\n      love? I could never stomach such a notion, while Fr. Jim would \nargue pas-\u0014\n      sionately in favor of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Hatred is dangerous even when justified, Soleveichik cautions, \nand must\u0014\n      be directed only at the truly vicious and depraved. We who \nhate must be wary,\u0014\n      he writes, lest we ... become like those we are taught to \ndespise.\u0014\n\u0014\n       BUT WHEN HATRED is called for, he notes, it serves a vital \nfunction.\u0014\n     Hate allows us to keep our guard up, to protect us. When we are \nfacing those\u0014\n     who seek nothing but our destruction, our hate reminds us who we \nare dealing\u0014\n     with. When hate is appropriate, then it is not only virtuous, \nbut essential.\u0014",

Doctors describe her as saintly. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe excommunication of Sister Margaret McBride in Phoenix underscores \nall that to me feels morally obtuse about the church hierarchy. I \nhope that a public outcry can rectify this travesty. \u0014\n\u0014\nSister Margaret was a senior administrator of St. Josephs Hospital \nin Phoenix. A 27-year-old mother of four arrived late last year, in \nher third month of pregnancy. According to local news reports and \naccounts from the hospital and some of its staff members, the mother \nsuffered from a serious complication called pulmonary hypertension. \nThat created a high probability that the strain of continuing \npregnancy would kill her. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this tragic case, the treatment necessary to save the mothers \nlife required the termination of an 11-week pregnancy, the hospital \nsaid in a statement. This decision was made after consultation with \nthe patient, her family, her physicians, and in consultation with the \nEthics Committee. \u0014\n\u0014\nSister Margaret was a member of that committee. She declined to \ndiscuss the episode with me, but the bishop of Phoenix, Thomas \nOlmstead, ruled that Sister Margaret was automatically \nexcommunicated because she assented to an abortion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe mothers life cannot be preferred over the childs, the \nbishops communication office elaborated in a statement. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet us just note that the Roman Catholic hierarchy suspended priests \nwho abused children and in some cases defrocked them but did not \nnormally excommunicate them, so they remained able to take the \nsacrament. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince the excommunication, Sister Margaret has left her post as vice \npresident and is no longer listed as one of the hospital executives \non its Web site. The hospital told me that she had resigned at the \nbishops request but is still working elsewhere at the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nI heard about Sister Margaret from an acquaintance who is a doctor at \nthe hospital. After what happened to Sister Margaret, he doesnt dare \nbe named, but he sent an e-mail to his friends lamenting the \nexcommunication of a saintly nun: \u0014\n\u0014\nShe is a kind, soft-spoken, humble, caring, spiritual woman whose \nspot in Heaven was reserved years ago, he said in the e-mail \nmessage. The idea that she could be ex-communicated after decades of \nservice to the Church and humanity literally makes me nauseated. \u0014\n\u0014\nTrue Christians, like Sister Margaret, understand that real life is \nfull of difficult moral decisions and pray that they make the right \ndecision in the context of Christs teachings. Only a group of \ndetached, pampered men in gilded robes on a balcony high above the \nrest of us could deny these dilemmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nA statement from the bishops office did not dispute that the \nmothers life was in danger  although it did note that no doctors \nprediction is 100 percent certain. The implication is that the church \nwould have preferred for the hospital to let nature take its course. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Catholic hierarchy is entitled to its views. But the \nepisode reinforces perceptions of church leaders as rigid, dogmatic, \nout of touch  and very suspicious of independent-minded American \nnuns. \u0014\n\u0014\nSister Margaret made a difficult judgment in an emergency, saved a \nlife and then was punished and humiliated by a lightning bolt from a \nbishop who spent 16 years living in Rome and who has devoted far less \ntime to serving the downtrodden than Sister Margaret. Compare their \ntwo biographies, and Sister Margarets looks much more like Jesuss \nthan the bishops does. \u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone I know considers Sister Margaret to be the moral conscience \nof the hospital, Dr. John Garvie, chief of gastroenterology at St. \nJosephs Hospital, wrote in a letter to the editor to The Arizona \nRepublic. She works tirelessly and selflessly as the living example \nand champion of compassionate, appropriate care for the sick and \ndying.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a hierarchy of mostly aging men pounce on and excommunicate a \nrevered nun who was merely trying to save a mothers life, the church \nseems to me almost as out of touch as it was in the cruel and \ndebauched days of the Borgias in the Renaissance.\u0014",

So enraged and bitter was Leonardo \nthat he determined to paint the face of his enemy, the other artist, \ninto the face of Judas, and thus take his revenge and vent his spleen \nby handling the man down in infamy and scorn to succeeding \ngenerations. The face of Judas was therefore one of the first that he \nfinished, and everyone could easily recognize it as the face of the \npainter with whom he had quarreled. \u0014\n\u0014\n But when he came to paint the face of Christ, he could make no \nprogress. Something seemed to be baffling him, holding him back, \nfrustrating his best efforts. At length he came to the conclusion \nthat the thing which was checking and frustrating him was the fact \nthat he had painted his enemy into the face of Judas. He therefore \npainted out the face of Judas and commenced anew on the face of \nJesus, and this time with the success which the ages have acclaimed. \u0014\n\u0014\n You cannot at one and the same time be painting the features of \nChrist into your own life and painting another face with the colors \nof enmity and hatred. \u0014\n\u0014\nC.

    "words": "During the Revolutionary War there lived in Pennsylvania a pastor by \nthe name of Peter Miller. Although Miller was greatly loved by \neveryone in the community, there was one man who lived near the \nchurch who hated him and had earned an unenviable reputation for his \nabuse of the minister. This man was not only a hater of the church, \nbut it also turned out that he was a traitor to his country, and was \nconvicted of treason and sentenced to death. \u0014\n\u0014\n The trial was conducted in Philadelphia, and no sooner did Miller \nhear of it than he set out on foot to visit General Washington and \ninterceded for the man's life. But Washington told him, \"I'm sorry \nthat I cannot grant your request for your friend.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Friend!\" Miller cried. \"Why, that man is the worst enemy I have in \nthe world!\"\u0014\n \"What?\" the general exclaimed in surprise. \"Have you walked sixty \nmiles to save the life of an enemy? That, in my judgment, puts the \nmatter in a different light. I will grant him a pardon for your sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The pardon was made out and signed by General Washington, and Miller \nproceeded at once on foot to a place fifteen miles distant where the \nexecution was scheduled to take place that afternoon. He arrived just \nas the man was being carried to the scaffold, and when he saw Miller \nhurrying toward the place, remarked, \"There is old Peter Miller. He \nhas walked all the way from Ephrata to have his revenge gratified \ntoday by seeing me hung.\" But scarcely had he spoken the words when \nMiller pushed his way through to the condemned man and handed him the \npardon that saved his life.\u0014",

The hot spots are Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai  thanks to \nSlumdog Millionaire, the film that started a thousand tours  and \nmy home, Kibera, a Nairobi slum that is perhaps the largest in \nAfrica. \u0014\n\u0014\nSlum tourism has its advocates, who say it promotes social awareness. \nAnd its good money, which helps the local economy. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut its not worth it. Slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment, \nsomething that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from. \nPeople think theyve really seen something  and then go back to \ntheir lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we \nwere before. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was 16 when I first saw a slum tour. I was outside my \n100-square-foot house washing dishes, looking at the utensils with \nlonging because I hadnt eaten in two days. Suddenly a white woman \nwas taking my picture. I felt like a tiger in a cage. Before I could \nsay anything, she had moved on. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was 18, I founded an organization that provides education, \nhealth and economic services for Kibera residents. A documentary \nfilmmaker from Greece was interviewing me about my work. As we made \nour way through the streets, we passed an old man defecating in \npublic. The woman took out her video camera and said to her \nassistant, Oh, look at that. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor a moment I saw my home through her eyes: feces, rats, starvation, \nhouses so close together that no one can breathe. I realized I didnt \nwant her to see it, didnt want to give her the opportunity to judge \nmy community for its poverty  a condition that few tourists, no \nmatter how well intentioned, could ever understand. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther Kibera residents have taken a different path. A former \nschoolmate of mine started a tourism business. I once saw him take a \ngroup into the home of a young woman giving birth. They stood and \nwatched as she screamed. Eventually the group continued on its tour, \ncameras loaded with images of a woman in pain. What did they learn? \nAnd did the woman gain anything from the experience? \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fair, many foreigners come to the slums wanting to understand \npoverty, and they leave with what they believe is a better grasp of \nour desperately poor conditions. The expectation, among the visitors \nand the tour organizers, is that the experience may lead the tourists \nto action once they get home. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut its just as likely that a tour will come to nothing. After all, \nlooking at conditions like those in Kibera is overwhelming, and I \nimagine many visitors think that merely bearing witness to such \npoverty is enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nNor do the visitors really interact with us. Aside from the \noccasional comment, there is no dialogue established, no conversation \nbegun. Slum tourism is a one-way street: They get photos; we lose a \npiece of our dignity. \u0014\n\u0014\nSlums will not go away because a few dozen Americans or Europeans \nspent a morning walking around them. There are solutions to our \nproblems  but they wont come about through tours. \u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy Odede, the executive director of Shining Hope for \nCommunities, a social services organization, is a junior at Wesleyan \nUniversity.\u0014",

Was there some fault in \nhim that God would send the rest of the church leaders to death but \nspare him?\u0014\n\u0014\nSixtus II, Bishop of Rome (pope) in the year 258, comforted Lawrence. \nGod was keeping him back to undergo an even greater ordeal, said the \nbishop. \"Be comforted, you will follow me in three days,\" he is \nsupposed to have predicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman emperor, Valerian, had ordered the death of all Rome's \nbishops, priests and deacons. The prefect (Roman magistrate) who \ncarried out the order, however, knew that, as deacon, Lawrence had \ncharge of the church's money. \"I'll let you go free,\" he promised, \n\"if you will turn the money over to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the oldest traditions we have, Lawrence agreed to bring \nthe church's treasures to the prefect. \"But it will take me a few \ndays,\" he said. \"The church is very rich.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReleased to carry out his promise, Lawrence distributed the church's \ngoods among the poor. He then gathered the city's lame, its blind, \nand its beggars. On the third day he appeared before the prefect. \n\"Come out and see the wondrous riches of God,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" raged the prefect.\u0014\n\u0014\nLawrence explained that these poor people would some day have new \nbodies and live forever in Heaven. The treasure of the Holy Spirit \nwas hidden in them as if in jars of clay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThwarted from getting his gold and believing that he would be the \nlaughing stock of Rome, the prefect ordered a slow death for \nLawrence. On this day, August 10, 258, Lawrence was tortured by \nhaving his arms dislocated and then was laid upon a grill and slowly \nroasted to death. During his ordeal, he is said to have suggested his \nkillers turn him over, remarking that he was \"done\" on the one side. \nHe was so calm that the pagans who looked on were greatly impressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is how the legends tell the story, but the facts are not easy to \nestablish. What is certain is that Lawrence was martyred on this day. \nA hundred years later his story was so well known that the famous \nBishop Ambrose of Milan wrote about him and so did others. By then, \nemperor Constantine had long since built a chapel in his memory. \nLater popes built other memorials and these became Rome's Church of \nSan Lorenzo.\u0014",

    "title": "SAMSON: NATIONAL HERO OR TERRORIST?",
    "words": "Samson: National Hero or Terrorist?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Nathan Napier\u0014\nJuly 11, 2010 \u0014\nAs much national attention is given to terrorism, and along with it \nthe demonization of the Islamic faith, it is surprising that so few \ncommentators have inspected our own Judeo-Christian tradition for \ntraces of violence associated with creed or theological belief. \u0014\n\u0014\nAre Christians simply missing the entire Deuteronomic history and all \nthe violence done in the name of God? Has anyone read the Book of \nJoshua lately? Do cities such as Hazor and Jericho mean anything to \nthose of us who claim to know Scripture and live by it?\u0014\n\u0014\nActs of violence in the name of creed, or deeply held theological \npositions, are not monopolized by the Islamic faith. The \nJudeo-Christian tradition also has its share of violence in the name \nof God  even violence in the form of suicidal acts of punishment. \nSamson is one such story.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamson, the man with a birth narrative eerily similar to those of \nJohn the Baptist and Jesus in the New Testament, makes the most of \nhis sanctified status as a Nazarite by killing himself and thousands \nof Philistines.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot much of his life is remembered by people who know his story. The \nbrief stories that begin in Judges 13 and end in Judges 16 are \nshrouded by the ending of his life wherein he says a final prayer for \nstrength before taking his life and those of his adversaries. Thus, \nthe narrative of Samson begs the reader: national hero or terrorist?\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians read the Samson story as one of heroic redemption. \nSamson, a man sanctified at birth, tragically succumbs to life's \ntemptations. He spends much of his time in relationships with foreign \nwomen and flirting with his enemies. His strength is a source of his \nown hubris rather than something he uses for the glory of God. He \ndoes not adhere to the commands to \"neither look to the left or \nright.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the contrary, he seems to invite trouble with his silly riddles \nand the frequent trappings placed upon him by Delilah. Samson fails \nto see who he is, and the Philistines help him by capturing him and \nremoving his eyes toward the end of the narrative. Yet, in the end he \nis redeemed. \u0014\n\u0014\nImprisoned and standing as a spectacle in the Temple of Dagon, Samson \nfinds the religion he never really had in the narrative and prays \nthat God would avenge him from his enemies. He places his hands among \nthe pillars of the temple and becomes a martyr for the true God \nYahweh. Samson is enshrined as a national hero.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is one way of reading the Samson narrative.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other way is to acknowledge that his actions are frighteningly \nfamiliar to those of modern-day terrorist activities. Samson performs \nan act of violence. It is commenced with a prayer to his God. He is \nwilling to kill himself in the process of killing his enemies. It is \na battle between deities, as Samson beseeches his God in the temple \nof the other god, Dagon. This is not just a national disagreement; \nSamson is invoking a competition of divinities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this not what Islamic militants do today? Could the same not be \nsaid of the 9/11 hijackers or any recent terroristic attempt?\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrorism, according to the FBI, has three characteristics. First, it \nencompasses an illegal activity and the use of force associated \ntherewith. Second, it is an action that is intended to intimidate or \ncoerce. Lastly, the act is done in support of political or social \nobjectives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Samson narrative fits this characterization quite nicely. Samson \ndoes use force  force that comes from his God. His act most \ncertainly would have been an intimidation to surrounding enemies of \nIsrael and definitely would have had an impact on the Philistine \ncommunity. The death of Samson as suicidal martyr, empowered by \nIsrael's God, would have been strongly intimidating and created an \nenvironment wherein Israel could coercively enforce its will.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the recognition of this act as Divine origin would have \ncreated a political environment wherein Israel could thrive. Who \nwould want to oppose such a people? This act would also have lent \nimmediate credibility to Israel's religion and its God. Israel's \nreligion, as a strictly social phenomenon, would have automatically \nenjoyed respect after such an event.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo often we condone violence or terror, when it is done in the name \nof a creed or belief we personally hold. We give Samson a collective \npass on his actions because he does this in the name of our God, the \npresumed Father of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, if we just consider the merits of the narrative, what is the \nfundamental difference in the action of Samson or contemporary \nmilitant terrorists? Do they both not accomplish the same goals with \nthe same means? Are not both narratives, present-day terrorism and \nthe ancient story of Samson, fueled by violence with theological \npresuppositions in an effort to change the behavior of others? Is God \nnot centrally invoked in both instances? Are unbelievers, or those \nthat believe in a false God, not targets? Is the result not terror \nand intimidation, whether it is directed at present-day Americans or \nancient people known as Philistines?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs American Christians continue to engage in the question of \nterrorism, we should perhaps look at our own ancient backgrounds \nbefore we begin accusing others. Judaism has come a long way since \nthe days of the Judges, and Christianity has left the Crusades in the \nDark Ages, but the stories of terror are still part of our story \ntoday. In the end, stories such as Samson's will not excuse the \ncontemporary violence of other people, but it might help us better \nunderstand it.\u0014\n\u0014\nNathan Napier is a minister in the Church of the Nazarene\u0014",

It was there that a kindly Spanish monk \nransomed him and then taught him the Christian faith. After remaining \nwith the monk for two years, the young man sought employment with \nSlaney.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlaney was a wealthy merchant and treasurer of the Newfoundland \nCompany. He was a Christian and he showed kindness to the young man. \nHe employed the young man to clean out his horse stalls and Slaney \nbegan teaching him English. The young man expressed his strong desire \nto return to his home in North America. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter being in Slaney's employment for three years, the young man got \nhis wish. In 1619, Slaney arranged for a fishing boat to return the \nyoung man to home. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man was Squanto, who Pilgrim Governor William Bradford \nwould describe in 1621 as \"a special instrument sent of God\". Squanto \nhelped the Pilgrims establish their colony in Massachusetts. But \nSquanto's special gifts would not have been realized had it not been \nfor the kindness of a Spanish monk and Sir John Slaney.\u0014",

    "words": "Seeds of Doubt: When Facts Outlive Their Usefulness\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Cliff Vauhgn\u0014\nAugust 31, 2010, Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You're entitled to your own opinions,\" the saying begins. \"But \nyou're not entitled to your own facts.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe not. But we're at least entitled to ignore or deny as many \nfacts as necessary to reach a conclusion more suited to our palate.\u0014\n\u0014\nTime magazine media critic James Poniewozik thoughtfully examines \nthis state of affairs in his recent column, \"The Myth of Fact.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Journalists, and those who critique them, like to believe that facts \nconquer all. If the press reports quickly, fully and responsibly, \nmyths will be dispelled, scales will fall from eyes, and society will \nbe guided along the path of reason,\" writes Poniewozik. \"It's time to \nwonder whether that belief is itself a myth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's past time. Poniewozik's examples of the controversies \nsurrounding Barack Obama's birthplace and faith, the establishment of \n\"death panels\" in health care reform, the real mother of Trig Palin  \nthese cultural talking points surely suggest that facts may have \noutlived their usefulness, at least for folks who find factual \nevidence inconvenient.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat's noteworthy, though, is that people typically interested in \ndefending Absolute Truth seem to be the first ones to ignore mounting \nevidence and its logical conclusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, folks who see the Bible as an evidentiary endpoint \nare oddly skeptical of mountains of evidence, even when the proof on \nany given topic doesn't contradict anything Scripture has to say. \nAgain, witness the Obama birth controversy and its popularity among \nChristians. Ditto for climate change skepticism.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow this is not about holding a minority opinion. This is about \nholding an opinion in defiance of the tools of logic, in defiance of \nhaving verifiable evidence to support a claim, in defiance of the \nbest work of our best experts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's no wonder that our most popular media outlets are increasingly \nincapable of showing us real debate on issues. We thought it was \nbecause screaming heads are more entertaining. That's true. But maybe \nit's also true that \"debate\" is pointless if \"facts\" are meaningless \n(or if they have to be put in quotes). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen there are two (or three or more) legitimate sides to an issue, \nwe need to consider those other points of view. But media programs \nneed to exercise better judgment; half-baked claims don't equal \nwell-reasoned positions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and \nplanted in his field,\" said Jesus. \"Though it is the smallest of all \nseeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and \nbecomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTurns out the mustard seed doesn't illustrate only the kingdom of \nheaven; it also represents what passes in the public square in 2010. \nNow a seed of doubt planted in a partisan field grows into a tree big \nenough to dominate the landscape.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a land increasingly hostile to truth claims, even logical \nconclusions. \u0014\n\u0014\nCliff Vaughn is managing editor and media producer for \nEthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "words": "In a Dallas newspaper, Blackie Sherrod once told the following story \nabout Barry Switzer, a former coach of the Dallas Cowboys\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked how he handled the pressure of being a football coach, \nparticularly the constant threat of being fired if he had several \nlosing seasons, he said, Pressure is something some people have to \ndeal with daily, but there are many people who have no idea what \npressure is. To illustrate this, he told about his upbringing. \nSwitzer was born in a shotgun farmhouse outside a dusty mill town in \nsouthern Arkansas. The biggest event of his young years came during \nthe summer before the ninth grade, when the REA (Rural \nElectrification Association) reached down the gravel road where he \nlived.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was a big day for us. It meant we could have running water, \nindoor plumbing, and even one of those fans to keep us cool on hot \nnights and keep the mosquitoes away. No more coal or oil lamps and \nlistening to the Grand Ole Opry on a battery radio. Our home wasn't \nmuch different from anyone else's. Those were the times, and the \ntimes were tough.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwitzer's dad was the county bootlegger. We were raided many times, \nand he often spent nights in the county jail. But finally they got \nserious, and he was sent to the state pen. You can imagine this \nwasn't kept secret in a small Southern Baptist town. I was beginning \nto experience what I consider real pressure. Most town folk didn't \nwant their daughters dating the county bootlegger's son.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwitzer's dad got out of prison and returned to bootlegging, and \nthings were almost normal until one night before Barry's senior year \nat the University of Arkansas when he was awakened by a gunshot. His \nmother had killed herself. In a few years, his father, a bootlegger \nwho served prison time, was killed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Feet of Clay by Paul Powell\u0014",

The people \nwere known as Samaritans, after Israels former capital, Samaria.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Jews of the southern kingdom returned from their exile in \nBabylon, they locked horns with the Samaritans.

The Samaritans \nand Jews were now two separate peoples, with similarbut \ndifferentreligious practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament depicts the hostility between Jews and Samaritans. \nThe Romans had created the province of Samaria between Galilee and \nJudea, and the Jewish inhabitants of those two regions disliked \ntraveling through Samaria, bypassing it when they could. Samaritan \nwas a slur word on Jewish lips, and Jesus enemies accused Him of \nbeing one (John 8:48). John 4 records a remarkable dialogue between \nJesus and a woman in Samaria, a dialogue that makes it clear that \nChrist had compassion for Samaritans.

She has had the photograph copied so her four children each \nhave one. Jenica doesn't want them to forget what took place between \nthe person in the picture and Jenica's great-great-grandmother, Lydia.\u0014\n\u0014\nLydia, born in 1845, was a servant in Mrs. Hale's home. She was \ndedicated to the Hale family and never spoke a harsh word against \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\nLydia was very soft-spoken and she was one of very few slaves who \ncould read. Mrs. Hale had given her a Bible when she learned how well \nLydia could read. Mrs. Hale had a live-in nanny for her seven \nchildren and Lydia and the nanny were secret friends. The nanny was \nwhite and Lydia knew she could never acknowledge her friend out in \nthe open. Jenica wishes she knew the nanny's name.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jenica knows Mrs. Hale's name. Mrs. Hale was apparently very good \nto her servants and was sympathetic to the marches calling for the \nabolition of slavery, much to her husband's chagrin. Her husband was \na horse trader and had three stables full of beautiful Arabians. He \nneeded his slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Hale needed her slaves too, but she was much softer of \ncharacter. She suspected Lydia and the nanny were good friends and \ngave them many opportunities to have time together. Lydia was in \ncharge of the nursery and children's wing of the home.\u0014\n\u0014\nLydia had been Mrs. Hale's slave for thirteen years when the Civil \nWar broke out in 1861. Lydia was 21. It took four more years until \nslavery was abolished and Lydia was told she was free to leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Lydia didn't want to go. She loved Mrs. Hale, the nanny, and her \nlife on the horse ranch. Lydia was allowed to stay although she was \npaid for her service. Jenica doesn't know much more after that, but \nher great-great-grandmother was allowed to raise a family on the \ngrounds. Her days were long serving Mrs. Hale, and her evenings were \nspent caring for her husband and five children. \u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Hale once gave Lydia a photograph of herself. It is the \nphotograph that has been handed down for generations to Jenica. The \nfaith and love of Lydia and Mrs. Hale has been repeated carefully. \nLydia wanted her children and grandchildren to know the story. \u0014\n\u0014\nLydia was 43 when Mrs. Hale contracted a fever. The fever was \nterrible: it had already taken the lives of two of Lydia's children \nand Lydia was afraid her beloved mistress was going to die.\u0014\n\u0014\nLydia came to care for Mrs. Hale against doctor's orders: Mrs. Hale's \nfever was contagious. Still, Lydia wanted to care for her in her last \ndays. Mrs. Hale gave Lydia a ring: a ring that was given to Mrs. Hale \nby her mother on her fifteenth birthday. It was a large blue sapphire \nwith three diamonds on each side, set in gold. It is said that Lydia \nlooked at it every night but never wore it. It was just too precious \nto her. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a beautiful ring and Jenica treasures it very much. Lydia's \nmistress did die, but not before she blessed Lydia. She gave her \nthanks to Lydia for her unequivocal devotion. Lydia had truly been a \nblessing to Mrs. Hale. ...\u0014",

    "title": "SECRETARIAT, THE MOVIE",
    "words": "Hanging onto a horse's tale: \nSecretariat still astounds us\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Maria Puente, USA TODAY \u0014\nWhere have you gone, Secretariat? A nation turns its lonely eyes to \nyou. \u0014\nApologies to songwriter Paul Simon, who wrote this line in the song \nMrs. Robinson more than 40 years ago, with baseball great Joe \nDiMaggio as the lost savior. But Secretariat was another hero whose \nlike we may not see again.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe may have been the greatest equine athlete ever, the only non-human \nwith a place on ESPN's list of top 100 athletes of the 20th century, \nthe only non-human to appear on the covers of Time, Newsweek and \nSports Illustrated in the same week. Horse racing and breeding being \nwhat they are these days, chances are Secretariat will stand alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo we'll have to settle for the movie version: Thirty-seven years \nafter he raced into hearts and history, Secretariat thunders back \ninto the national spotlight Friday in Disney's Secretariat, a movie \nabout hope and glory, human and equine courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecretariat is the first big-screen recap of the triumph of the big \nred horse in the white-and-blue checkers. For a few weeks in the \nsummer of 1973, as the Vietnam War was winding down and the Watergate \nscandal was winding up, he turned a divided nation into one, \nawestruck by his astonishing feat in conquering horse racing's \npinnacle, the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. (Only 11 horses \nhave won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont \nStakes.) And he did it without steroids.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Secretariat was incorruptible  what he represented was purity of \nheart, purity of passion and a lack of compromise,\" says director \nRandall Wallace (Braveheart, Pearl Harbor). \"He ran his heart out, \nand the world is hungry for that sort of integrity and courage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe movie is also the story of Secretariat's owner, Penny Chenery \n(Diane Lane), the housewife-turned-horsewoman who took over her dying \nfather's struggling Meadow Farm in Virginia to pursue his dream of \nwinning the Triple Crown.\u0014\n\u0014\nChenery was no women's-libber, as they used to say disparagingly, but \nshe took on the male-dominated horse-racing world and left them \nchoking in the dust as Secretariat ran off with records still \nunmatched and with millions in a syndication deal that was one of the \nfirst of its kind.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just had the better horse,\" Chenery, 88, used to say back then, \nand still says in interviews from her Colorado home. \"I worked hard \nto keep his moment alive, and it was such a wonderful moment for me, \nI didn't want it to be over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLane, a New York native who was raised on quarter horses, remembers \ncelebrating the Thoroughbred's historic win. \"I remember being 8 and \nloving horses, so it made perfect sense to me that one should \nsuddenly be on the cover of Time or Newsweek,\" she says. \"He was a \nconfluence of miracles. There are probably 25 ingredients you need to \nbe a successful racehorse. Secretariat had all of that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides Chenery, Team Secretariat included Lucien Laurin (John \nMalkovich), his colorful trainer; his jockey Ron Turcotte (Otto \nThorwarth, a real jockey with 1,300 wins); groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan \nEllis), his closest human companion; and Miss Elizabeth Ham (Margo \nMartindale), Chenery's assistant and confidante, who picked the name \nSecretariat for the chestnut-red horse with three white socks and a \nwhite star with a narrow blaze.\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, and five horses play Secretariat  four Thoroughbreds and a \nquarter horse, including Trolley Boy, who won the 2008 Secretariat \nLook-Alike contest held at the annual Secretariat Festival in Paris, \nKy. Ever the PR pros, Disney arranged for Trolley Boy to \"walk\" the \nred carpet at the movie premiere in Hollywood last week, alongside \nthe stars and Chenery and her family, who were extras in the race \nscenes.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisney has high hopes for the movie and so does Chenery, who's mostly \nretired, although she still owns two racehorses. \"The movie brings \nback good memories, but will it have legs?\" Chenery says. \"This is \nwhat I'm really hoping for, that it will get people out of \nthemselves\" in this time of widespread woe.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn to run \u0014\n\u0014\nRacehorses can do that. They are so powerful and yet so fragile, as \ndemonstrated by the tragic story of Barbaro, the 2006 Derby winner \nand Triple Crown contender whose leg shattered in the Preakness. For \nmonths, millions anxiously followed futile attempts to save him; it \nwas front-page news when he was finally put down.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Horses are awe-inspiring when they're at the top of their game, and \nwhen one comes along who's better than all the others, it's kind of a \nreligious experience\" for many people, says Laura Hillenbrand, an \nexpert on the uplifting power of winning horses as the author of \nSeabiscuit: An American Legend. Racehorses \"are not out there for the \nmoney, they're out there for the purest of intentions  they love to \nrun, they love to win, and people just respond to that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bond between horses and people is enduring, says Steve Haskin, \nlongtime racing reporter and senior correspondent for Blood-Horse \nmagazine who covered the 1973 Triple Crown campaign. \"Nearly every \nchild grows up touched by horses  Black Stallion and Black Beauty, \nSilver and Trigger, Misty of Chincoteague and Mr. Ed,\" says Haskin. \n\"Those childhood feelings for the equine heroes of our youth, they \ndon't die, they remain quiescent until a Secretariat comes along. And \nthen, whether you're 7 or 70, we're all children again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeabiscuit, who raced in the 1930s and was the subject of a 2003 \nmovie, became a symbol of hope during the depths of the Depression; \nfew are left who saw him. But plenty still remember Secretariat on \nthe afternoon of June 9, 1973. Across the country, people stopped \nwhat they were doing to watch or listen as Secretariat  already the \nrecord-setting winner of the Derby and the Preakness  clinched the \nfinal race of the Triple Crown (the first to do it in a quarter \ncentury) with an incredible 31-length win at New York's Belmont Park. \nIt remains one of the most famous sportscasts in TV history  a \n2.24-minute thrill that lives on in grainy footage on the Internet.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That horse learned how to fly,\" says Bill Nack, 69, another longtime \nhorse-racing reporter and Secretariat's biographer, whose book, \nSecretariat: The Making of a Champion, formed the basis of the film. \n(Kevin Connolly plays him in the film.) Nack tears up talking about \nSecretariat. \"It was the most magical time in my life. The arc of the \nmovie is true, and to see it come alive on the screen is tremendous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA symbol of hope \u0014\n\u0014\nSecretariat was a tonic for the times, says Kate Chenery Tweedy, \nPenny Chenery's oldest daughter and co-author of a new photo-heavy \nmemoir, Secretariat's Meadow: The Land, the Family, the Legend. Back \nthen, she was a teen flirting with the anti-war movement while Mom \ncommuted from Denver to Virginia and to racing venues back East.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People said Secretariat restored their faith in humanity, which was \nodd since he wasn't human, but what they meant was that they really \nneeded something pure and good and triumphant,\" Tweedy says. \"We were \ntaking a licking in Vietnam, and the same thing was happening in our \ngovernment with Watergate. It was a scary and depressing time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides, horse racing has an emotional quality, says veteran \nHollywood horse wrangler Rusty Hendrickson, who gathered the movie's \nequine actors and helped plan the shooting of the races. \"I think \nwhen people see a horse do what Secretariat did, even the most stoic \nof people get a lump in the throat.\"\u0014\nSecretariat's Triple Crown win was followed in 1977 by Seattle Slew's \nand in 1978 by Affirmed's. And since then, nothing, though several \nhorses have come close.\u0014\nBut Secretariat was a genetic anomaly: After he died unexpectedly at \nage 19 in 1989 (in stud retirement for 15 years on Kentucky's \nClaiborne Farm, he was suffering from laminitis, a painful hoof \ndisease, and had to be put down), they opened him up and found his \nheart was nearly three times the size of an average horse heart.\u0014\nStill, racing experts say that another Secretariat is unlikely, in \npart because the current breeding of racehorses emphasizes speed at \nthe expense of endurance, and partly because horse racing emphasizes \nbreeding at the expense of racing, so horses don't race as much or as \nlong and don't have as much time to fully develop. Just as a \ncomparison of then to now: In the late 1960s, the highest price for a \nyearling was $250,000; now it's $13 million, Haskin says.\u0014\n\"The horses aren't as sturdy and tough as horses of old were,\" Haskin \nsays. \"They've bred in unsoundness,\" Chenery adds. What happened to \nBarbaro is the result.\u0014\nHorse racing, like everything else in the struggling economy, is \ngoing through tough times, especially with competition from all the \nnew entertainment options available now compared with 1973. Andy \nSerling, the TV handicapper for the New York Racing Association, \nquibbles about some of the shortcuts the movie takes to tell a story \nin less than two hours, but he thinks Secretariat shows what's \ncompelling about horse racing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Secretariat was an amazing horse, and certainly his was the greatest \nsingle performance of all time, so anything that can expose people to \nwhat's exciting about horse racing, I'm all for it,\" Serling says. \"I \ndon't understand why more people don't love horse racing.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Should Tennessee Firemen Have Let the House Burn?\u0014\nBy Adam Cohen Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was one of the stranger news stories in a long time  and one of \nthe most polarizing. Firefighters in rural Tennessee looked on as a \nhouse burned because the family who lived in it had not paid the $75 \nannual fire-protection fee. Their home was destroyed  along with \nthree puppies that were inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is more striking than the story itself is the debate it has set \noff, which has been raging now for more than a week. While the \nfirefighters have come in for considerable criticism, a surprising \nnumber of commentators have come to their defense  and lashed out at \nthe family that lost their home.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet underlying the Tennessee fire debate is something much more \nserious and fundamental than the the back-and-forth, talking head \nbattles about who was more at fault in this incident. At a time when \nlots of Americans are debating who should have citizenship, the case \nof Gene and Paulette Cranicks' burnt-down house hints at the more \nprofound issue of what that citizenship should mean.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Cranicks live in Obion County, Tennessee, outside of the city \nlimits. That means they do not automatically get fire service  they \nhave to pay a special fee. The family says it has paid the fee in the \npast, but claims they simply forgot about it this year. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Cranicks' home caught on fire, the firefighters showed up  \nbut only to help out a neighbor, whose property was in the fire's \npath, who had paid the fire fee. Gene Cranick says he offered on the \nspot to pay whatever it took to put out the fire, but the \nfirefighters refused. It might seem that firefighters would have a \nlegal duty to put out a fire. But in this case, the firefighters did \nnot work for the Cranicks' county  they worked for a nearby city. \nTheir position was that they had no more obligation to put out the \nfire than New Jersey firemen would have to answer a call from New \nYork. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany observers were quick to find in the Cranicks' burning house a \nparable for the increasingly harsh times in which we live\u0014",

    "words": "Somalia: \nGirl stoned was a child of 13\u0014\n\u0014\nContrary to earlier news reports, the girl stoned to death in Somalia \nthis week was 13, not 23, Amnesty International can reveal. \u0014\n\u0014\nAisha Ibrahim Duhulow was killed on Monday, 27 October, by a group of \n50 men who stoned her to death in a stadium in the southern port of \nKismayu, in front of around 1,000 spectators. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Somali journalists who had reported she was 23 have told \nAmnesty International that this age was based upon a judgement of her \nage from her physical appearance. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was accused of adultery in breach of Islamic law but, her father \nand other sources told Amnesty International that she had in fact \nbeen raped by three men, and had attempted to report this rape to the \nal-Shabab militia who control Kismayo, and it was this act that \nresulted in her being accused of adultery and detained. None of men \nshe accused of rape were arrested. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not justice, nor was it an execution. This child suffered a \nhorrendous death at the behest of the armed opposition groups who \ncurrently control Kismayo, said David Copeman, Amnesty \nInternational's Somalia Campaigner. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis killing is yet another human rights abuse committed by the \ncombatants to the conflict in Somalia, and again demonstrates the \nimportance of international action to investigate and document such \nabuses, through an International Commission of Inquiry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmnesty International has learnt that: \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAisha Ibrahim Duhulow was reported as being 23, based upon a \njudgement on her physical appearance, according to one of the \njournalists who had reported the stoning. Her actual age was \nconfirmed to Amnesty International by other sources, including her \nfather. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHer father said she had only travelled to Kismayo from Hagardeer \nrefugee camp in north eastern Kenya three months earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tShe was detained by militia of the Kismayo authorities, a coalition \nof Al-shabab and clan militias. During this time, she was reportedly \nextremely distressed, with some individuals stating she had become \nmentally unstable. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA truckload of stones was brought into the stadium to be used in \nthe stoning. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAt one point during the stoning, Amnesty International has been \ntold by numerous eyewitnesses that nurses were instructed to check \nwhether Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was still alive when buried in the \nground. They removed her from the ground, declared that she was, and \nshe was replaced in the hole where she had been buried for the \nstoning to continue. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAn individual calling himself Sheik Hayakalah, was quoted on Radio \nShabelle saying:``The evidence came from her side and she officially \nconfirmed her guilt, while she told us that she is happy with the \npunishment under Islamic law.'' In contradiction to this claim, a \nnumber of eye witnesses have told Amnesty International she struggled \nwith her captors and had to be forcibly carried into the stadium. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tInside the stadium, militia members opened fire when some of the \nwitnesses to the killing attempted to save her life, and shot dead a \nboy who was a bystander. An al-Shabab spokeperson was later reported \nto have apologized for the death of the child, and said the milita \nmember would be punished.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Amnesty International.

    "words": "October 24, 1788 \u0014\n\u0014\nSarah Hale Gave Us Thanksgiving Day\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah Beull unrolled her brother's gift to her. Horatio had given her \na homemade diploma. \"Mistress of Arts, Summa Cum Laude, Horatio Gates \nBeull College,\" it read.\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably Sarah laughed. All through Horatio's years at Dartmouth \nCollege, he had brought home his Latin, Mathematics and philosophy \nbooks and shared everything he learned with Sarah, who was doing all \nshe could to gain an education, despite the restrictions that kept \nher from attending college. She was such a devoted scholar that \nHoratio felt she, too, should be honored. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day, October 24, 1788, in Newport, New Hampshire, Sarah \novercame the disadvantage of discrimination against women to become \nan internationally respected author, editor and promoter of good \ncauses. She married.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost every American child is familiar with one bit of Sarah's work. \nShe wrote the kindergarten song, \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah was just thirty-five when her lawyer husband, David Hale, died \nof pneumonia. She had four children under seven years of age and a \nfifth on the way. How was she to support herself? David's colleagues \nequipped her with what she needed to engage in a sewing business. \nThey also paid for the publication of a book of her poems. The poems \nsold well enough that Sarah was able to leave off her sewing long \nenough to write a novel. \u0014\n\u0014\nNorthwood dealt with the issue of slavery and was set against a \nbackdrop of the increasing tension between the northern and southern \nstates. It sold well and established Sarah's name. Her book is \nconsidered the first important American novel by a woman. No doubt it \nhelped blaze the trail for Harriet Beecher Stowe's even more famous \nnovel, Uncle Tom's Cabin.\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah was offered an editor's job in Boston. It meant she had to \nleave her children with other family members, but she accepted the \noffer. To the end of her life, she would edit women's magazines, \nincluding Godey's Lady's Book. She broke new ground by featuring the \nwork of American authors, especially women, rather than European \nauthors. In her magazines, Sarah argued strongly that a woman's \nproper sphere was in the home; however, she championed women's \ncolleges and urged that women be given the chance to teach in them. \nShe supported Elizabeth Blackwell's determination to become a \nphysician and argued that single women should be allowed to become \nmissionaries. Sarah did her part for missions, too, serving as an \nofficer in the Women's Union Missionary Society and the Ladies' \nMedical Missionary Society of Philadelphia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Sarah's greatest achievement was to make Thanksgiving a holiday \nin the United States. She used her popular magazines as a forum to \nadvocate this national day of gratitude to God. Sarah worked \ntirelessly towards this goal for over fifteen years before Lincoln \nissued his Thanksgiving Proclamation in August, 1863. Not a bad track \nrecord for a girl educated at home, largely by her own efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe retired when she was ninety, writing \"I must bid farewell to my \ncountrywomen, with the hope that this work of half a century may be \nblessed to the furtherance of their happiness and usefulness in their \nDivinely-appointed sphere.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nLinton, Adelin.

    "title": "SAYERS' THE MAN BORN TO BE KING",
    "words": "December 21, 1941 \u0014\n\u0014\nSayer's The Man Born to Be King \u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year was 1941. Britain was at war--and not just with Germany. At \nhome, a fire-storm of controversy roared around a Christian writer.\u0014\nThe trouble began when the BBC (British Broadcast Corporation) \nannounced that it would produce a series of twelve radio plays \nretelling the life of Christ. The Man Born to Be King was written by \nthe scholar and popular mystery writer, Dorothy L. Sayers, a member \nof the Church of England. At a press conference, she explained that \nin order to adapt the gospels to radio, she had invented a few \ncharacters and combined Bible personages. To make the radio voices \ndistinct, she had sometimes used American slang or regional accents. \nFor instance, Matthew says, \"The fact is Philip, you've been had for \na sucker. You ought to keep your eyes skinned.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the reaction, one would have thought that she had burned a Bible \nin St. Paul's Cathedral. Before a single play was released, newspaper \nheadlines screamed \"blasphemy!\" Atheists complained that Christians \nwere being given free radio time for propaganda. Language lovers \ngriped, \"Should children listen to such unwholesome, American \nslang...?\" The Lord's Day Observance Society complained, \"A sinful \nman presuming to impersonate the Sinless One! It detracts from the \nhonor due to the Divine Majesty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPrime Minister Churchill was swamped with letters urging a ban on the \nplays. The Archbishop of Canterbury, leading official of the Church \nof England, received a similar flood of requests. A question was \nraised about the plays in the House of Commons. Dorothy continued \nwriting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough she is best known as the creator of detective Lord Peter \nWimsy, Dorothy was well-qualified to write Christian plays. She had \nalready done two for Canterbury Cathedral, both of which were so good \nthey ran for several weeks in London.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo detective had to be called in to learn where she stood on matters \nof faith. Reared in the Church of England, she did not follow the \npath of the majority of intellectuals, who abandoned the church. \nAlthough she had not lived a saintly life, neither had she renounced \nher faith. Just how satisfying Christianity was for her became clear \nin 1938 when she wrote a Sunday editorial for the Times. \"The \nChristian faith is the most exciting drama that ever staggered the \nimagination of man...and the dogma is the drama.\" A typical Sayers' \napproach was to poke fun at Higher Criticism by soberly applying its \ntechniques to Sherlock Holmes mysteries!\u0014\n\u0014\nShe accused religious leaders of being so careful to say nothing that \nwould offend anyone that they said nothing worth saying at all. In \nher radio dramas she presented Christ's story with superb \ncraftsmanship. She even had to invent the form she used. The nearest \nequivalent was the cycle of Arthurian legends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first play from The Man Born to Be King aired on this day, \nDecember 21st, 1941. Most listeners who contacted the BBC said they \nloved it. For many, the play raised morale by reminding them of their \nChristian roots. Dorothy made Christ's life seem so real that people \nwere forced to reconsider its meaning for themselves. The Bishop of \nWinchester said the cycle was the greatest evangelical appeal made in \nthe twentieth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDale, Alzina Stone.

    "words": "Sojourner Truth\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is rarely discussed, but Sojourner Truth fought for the \ndesegregation of public transportation in Washington, DC during the \nCivil War. She refused to face the indignities of Jim Crow \nsegregation on street cars and had the Jim Crow car removed from the \nWashington D. C. system. Sojourner Truth brought a local street to a \nstandstill when a driver refused her passage. With the support of the \ncrowd she forced the driver to carry her. During her legendary life, \nshe challenged injustice wherever she saw it. She was an \nabolitionist, women's rights activist and preacher. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn into slavery (as Isabella Baumfree) in upstate New York, \nSojourner Truth obtained her freedom and moved to New York City. \nThere she began to work with organizations designed to assist women. \nShe later became a traveling preacher and quickly developed a \nreputation as a powerful speaker. A turning point in her life \noccurred when she visited the Northhampton Association in \nMassachusetts. The members of this association included many of the \nleading abolitionists and women's rights activists of her time. Among \nthese people Sojourner Truth discussed issues of the day and as a \nresult of these discussions became one of the first people in the \ncountry to link the oppression of black slaves with the oppression of \nwomen. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a speaker, Sojourner Truth became known for her quick wit and \npowerful presence. She would never be intimidated. Because of her \npowerful speaking ability, independent spirit and her six foot frame, \nshe was often accused of being a man. She ended that in Silver Lake, \nIndiana when she exposed her breasts to the audience that accused \nher. \u0014\n\u0014\nSojourner Truth lived a long and productive life. She spoke before \nCongress and two presidents. Sojourner Truth is best remembered for a \nspeech she gave at a women's rights conference where she noticed that \nno one was addressing the rights of Black women. Her address reads in \npart: \"Dat man ober dar say dat womin needs to be helped over \ncarriages, and lifted ober dicthes and to have the best place \neverywhere. Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober muddpuddles, \nor bigs me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look at me. Looka at \nme arm.

    "words": "Isaiah 49:8-16a\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bleakness of Isaiah's world and the need for God's revealing word \nof hope have an echo in Alexander Solzenitsyn's memories of the Gulag \nArchipelago. Sitting distraught during his days in the Siberian labor \ncamps, he had lost his family and his days stretched out in endless \nbackbreaking efforts. Then the doctors told him he had cancer. There \nwas no cure. He would die soon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next day, he said, he barely got out of his bunk. His heart was \ngone. His mind was numb. He had no energy as he left to join the \nothers in the dawn work patrol. \"What's the use?!\" he asked himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nSolzenitsyn says that when he got to the rock quarries he dropped his \nshovel, sat down, resting his head on his tired, folded arms. He knew \nthe guards would see him soon, but he didn't care. He hoped that they \nwould shoot him. Then, at least, the pain would be over and the \nworries gone.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Just then,\" he writes, \"I felt someone standing near me. I looked \nup, and there was an old man. I'd never seen him before. I don't \nremember ever seeing him again. But he knelt over me, and he took a \nstick, and he drew a cross on the ground in front of me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat little act of a stranger did something for Solzenitsyn. \"That \ncross,\" he said, \"made me see things in a new way! There's a power in \nthis universe that is bigger than any empire or any government! \nThere's a God who experiences our pain and who dies our death and who \ncame back from the tombs. There's a God who gives life meaning, who \nis LIFE itself! That's what really matters here! That's why we exist! \nThat's why Jesus came to earth for us!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSolzenitsyn says that he sat there thinking about it all for a few \nmore minutes. Then he stood up, picked up his shovel, and went back \nto work. Things wouldn't change around him for over a year, but \ninside he was a new person. God lives! God cares! God is working out \nhis purposes!\u0014\n\u0014\nThat put Solzenitsyn's worries in their place. They didn't vanish or \ndisappear suddenly. Instead, they were caught up into a larger \nperspective of concern. How can I share the life of the Master? How \ncan my days be a reflection of his kingdom, his power, and his glory?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe God of Isaiah makes it clear that we mean more to him than \nanything else in this widely scattering universe. With the voice of a \nparent he calls out to us in these \"bleak midwinter\" days, \"Can a \nmother forget her child?\" \"I have engraved you on the palms of my \nhands!\" We are not alone. We are not forgotten. No matter what our \ncircumstances, we are neither beyond the searching eye of divine \nlove, nor the stretch of omnipotent and loving hands.\u0014",

    "words": "WE LEARN \nTHROUGH OUR SENSES\u0014\n\u0014\nInvolving our senses is not only important in worship but also in \npreaching. Studies about how\u0014\npeople learn and studies about how people communicate have both \nconfirmed that there are basically three groups ofpeople, with ranges \nof intensity within each group. The first group learns primarily \nthrough sight. Their communication will often include such words or \nphrases as: show, look, see, picture this, watch, observe, perceive. \nThey want God's vision for their life. About 60% ofthe population is \nvisually oriented in both learning and communication.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second group learns primarily through hearing. . Their \ncommunication will often include such words or phrases as: tell, \nknow, hear, harmony, listen, clear as a bell, sounds good to me, \nrings true. They are concerned about hearing God's call, hearing \nGod's word for their life. About 30% of the population is aurally \noriented in both their learning and communication.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third group learns primarily through feeling, both kinesthetic \nand emotionaL Their communication\u0014\nwill often include such kinesthetic words or phrases as: feel, grasp, \npoint out, sense, and words that express emotions such as: joy, \nanger, fear, annoyance, gladness. They are concerned with sensing \nGod's presence, feeling God's peace in their hearts. About 10% of the \npopulation is kinesthetically and emotionally oriented in both their \nlearning and communication. A reading specialist was able to help a \nhighly kinesthetic child learn to read by having her first learn her \nletters by tracing them in a tray ofsand and later learn words by \ntracing the words in the sand. Learning through the sense oftouch in \nher hands broke open the symbolism and mystery of reading for this \nchild.\u0014\n\u0014\n Representatives ofeach of these groups are present in our \ncongregations. The good preacher will include allusions in each \nsermon to \"seeing,\" to \"hearing,\" and to \"experiencing.\" But what is \nmore, the good preacher will use descriptive adjectives for seeing, \nfor hearing, and for feeling in the imaginative\u0014\nretelling of the scriptural text or in the illustrative material.\u0014",

As things are, to mention that he has no training \nas an academic historian, is recognized and honored by no other \nworkaday historians, and follows few canons of scholarship renders \nthe critic suspect. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe and his followers dismiss those critics with \"You're jealous!\" or \n\" Notice that he cries all the way to the bank\" or \"You're protecting \nyour professional cabal\" or \"Notice that he always quotes documents \nto support his views\" or \"You are prejudiced secularists and \nliberals!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is otherwise: Many of the main criticisms come from historians \ndubbed \"evangelical,\" who protest his ways and works.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice that self-identified \"evangelicals\" are not at the edges but \nin the center of the professional historian elite  among them, \nacross the spectrum of non-secularists, Mark Noll, Joel Carpenter, \nEdith Blumhofer, George Marsden, Grant Wacker, Harry Stout and dozens \nmore who deservedly all but dominate their caste as it covers \nreligious history. \u0014\n\u0014\nFind one who respects what Barton does to their field of work or \nthrough his methods. Ask them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSome other critics use the word \"fraud,\" and more  with good reason \n come up with terms like \"distorter\" or \"ideologue.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBarton's cause: to show from 18th-century documents that the Founding \nFathers determinedly and explicitly established a Christian state, \nwhich leaves all non-Christians as second-class citizens. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe and his \"Wall Builders\" institute cherry-pick lines from the \ndocuments and banner them or engrave them in public expressions. \nBarton & Co. get to pick the history texts for Texas etc., and thus \npush out of contention authors and publishers who, for all their \nflaws, are vocationally committed to fairness and, yes, truth-telling.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan he really believe his distortions? I don't call him a liar \nbecause, beyond his showmanship, he does believe some of this, having \nsaid it so often that it acquires an aura of factuality and the \nappeal of self-evident truth. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat would be the civil result if he'd succeed in gaining political \nsuccess to establish or privilege Christianity in public life? To \ntake faith out of the realm of \"coercion\" into \"persuasion?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJames Madison said that doing so, given the record of such legal \nsupport through centuries in many places, would turn out \"knaves, \nhypocrites and fools.\" Let's converse, not blast  and maybe produce \na wise citizenry. \u0014\n\u0014\nMadison would likely be glad, we'd all profit, and the \nnon-established, unprivileged, other-religious or nonreligious would \nhave the freedom for which those cherished Founders fought.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin E.

    "title": "SECOND COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE",
    "words": "May 5, 553 \u0014\n\u0014\n2nd Council of Constantinople\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nControversy over the God-man nature of Christ disturbed both church \nand empire throughout the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. \nTheological quarrels became party politics and several church-wide or \n\"general\" councils met to resolve the issues. The first of these \ncouncils, the famous Nicea Council, denounced Arianism, a teaching \nthat Christ was a created being. The three councils that followed \ntook up other aspects of the relationship between Christ's divinity \nand humanity. But heresies continued to spring up like weeds, as they \nstill do today. On this day, May 5, 553, Emperor Justinian convoked a \nfifth general council, the second to be held at Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Justinian was a vigorous ruler. Unfortunately, he thought the \nonly way his empire could enjoy unity was to compel religious \nuniformity. Consequently, he closed heathen schools and baptized \npagans by force. He all but wiped out the Montanists in fierce \npersecution. (The Montanists believed in ecstatic spiritual \nexperiences and end-of-the-world prophecies.) Justinian also built \nchurch sanctuaries, including the breathtaking Hagia Sophia (Holy \nWisdom).\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpress Theodora favored the monophysite views taught by Eutyches the \nArchmandrite (an archmandrite was the head of a monastery or several \nmonasteries). Monophysites deny that Christ had both a divine nature \nand human nature. Eutyches' form of monophysitism held that Christ's \ntwo natures, the Divine and the human, united so completely that they \nbecame physically one, with the Divine absorbing the human. Its \ntheological rival was Nestorianism, which was said to overemphasize \nthe distinctions between Christ's two natures. Under Theodora's \ninfluence, Justinian called the council to condemn writings that \nsupported Nestorianism--the Three Chapters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Three Chapters had already been dealt with in the important \nCouncil of Chalcedon. The writings were rebuked but the writers were \nnot condemned. Apparently, the monophysites hoped by re-opening the \nissue to win condemnation of the three writers. In so doing, they \nwould discredit the Council of Chalcedon by making its judgments \nappear incomplete or inadequate, creating an opening for further \nMonophysite advances.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council opened on this day, May 5, 553. In eight sessions, it \nupheld Chalcedon on the two natures of Christ, but condemned \"those \nwho say that there are two Sons and two Christs. For one is he who is \npreached by us and you, as we have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, \nonly begotten as man, according to the saying of the most learned \nPaul.\" They condemned the writings but spared the reputation of two \nof the three writers of the Three Chapters. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Vigilius swayed back and forth on the issues. Although he \nrefused to attend the council, he was at a disadvantage, because \nJustinian would not let him return to Rome unless he subscribed to \nthe council's findings. Vigilius capitulated, putting himself at odds \nwith his own previous writings and possibly even with the council of \nChalcedon. A western synod excommunicated him and he had to change \nhis position again before the western church would accept him back.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nJedin, Hubert.

    "words": "April 28, 1220 \u0014\n\u0014\nSalisbury Cathedral\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity has spawned many works of architecture. One of the most \nbeautiful is this at Old Sarum, England, just ten miles from \nStonehenge. Unlike most Medieval cathedrals, Salisbury was built in a \nsingle campaign. Bishop Poore laid the first five stones on this day, \nApril 28, 1220, one each for himself, Archbishop Stephen Langton, \nPope Honorius III, Earl William and Countess Ela of Salisbury. By \n1237 the choir and east transepts were built and by 1258 the nave and \nmain transepts. The plans and their implementation experienced few \nalterations. Consequently, Salisbury has more unity of design than \nmost English cathedrals of the period.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust who did design Salisbury is not known. Historian Paul Johnson \nsuggests that Elias of Dereham and Nicholas of Ely combined their \ntalents. At any rate, Bishop Poore was the motivating force behind \nthe project. He obtained the papal authority to build the cathedral \nand to locate it on a broad, flat piece of ground rather than on an \nearlier site. Had he built on the old site, the new would have had to \naccommodate itself to old foundations and the structure could not \nhave had the charm of the present building.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalisbury Cathedral is in the Early English Gothic style. Gothic \nemploys pointed arches, slender vertical piers, buttresses and \ndiagonals for an austere effect. Salisbury is shaped as a cross, ever \nthe symbol of Christian faith. Its interior is well-lighted. The \nflying buttresses (outside arches) are later additions. They became \nneedful because of the one major change made to the original \nconception by a later age.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe original plan called for a low tower. 110 years after the first \nstone was laid, the tower was doubled and Richard of Farleigh \ndesigned the octagonal spire which now completes the whole, making it \nthe second tallest in Europe. The addition of the spire added so much \nweight the crossing piers bent. They support almost 6,500 tons. \nConsequently new supports had to be added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cathedrals of Europe are symbols of intense faith. It took faith \nto start building one. Most were not completed in one generation or \neven in two. Their spires, straining toward heaven, are standing \nprayers to God. In their windows we read the gospel story. Not a few \nornaments remind us of the lurking powers of hell. Salisbury is \nlittle encumbered with such detail, and the simplicity of its decor \nhas been described as peculiarly English in its understatement. \nSalisbury Cathedral remains a testimony to an age of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnson, Paul.

    "words": "May 22, 1498 \u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola's Interrogation and Sentence\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man left home secretly at 23, without parental approval, \nflinging aside years of medical and philosophical education, to join \nthe Dominicans. Convinced of the reality of the after-life, with its \ndismal doom or glorious salvation, he became morose. An urgent sense \nof right drove him to denounce the morals of the day. At first his \nmessages were too scholarly for the masses, but in time they gained \npower. Audiences pressed into chapel to hear him utter dark \nprophecies of the future of Italy and Florence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSavonarola became one of the great names of his age. Pietro de Medici \nof Florence was a weak man. Savonarola's allies deposed the \nineffectual tyrant and the priest became the city's effective leader, \nand a gadfly in the side of the corrupt Renaissance Pope, Alexander \nVI. He denounced papal iniquity and took political sides against the \npope. Worst of all, from the Pope's point of view, he called upon \nEurope's leaders to dethrone the pontiff.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexander in turn sought to bring down the puritanical friar who \nspoke with such vehemence against his pleasures and vices. Yet he was \npatient and could bide his time, for he saw that the political tide \nmust soon turn against Savonarola.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a time, Savonarola triumphed. A Florentine republic was formed. \nSavonarola's bullies burned the \"vanities\" of the city-- art works \nand books. No building had sufficient capacity to hold the thousands \nwho came for his sermons. By 1498 all had changed. Poorly conceived \npolicies, by no means all Savonarola's fault, starved the city. Its \ncoffers were empty. Alexander VI threatened interdiction. While many \nof Savonarola's predictions came true, others failed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Florentines turned against the preacher they had lauded. A \nFranciscan challenged Savonarola to an ordeal by fire. Savonarola's \ndisciple Domenico da Pescia accepted as his surrogate. Crowds \ngathered. The Franciscan backed out and used every device to prevent \nthe test. Cheated of their spectacle, the crowds blamed Savonarola. \nThe next day he was arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween April 9th and May 23rd Savonarola was tortured repeatedly and \nforced to recant. Each time, when he recovered from the torments, he \nrenounced his recantations, the last time with such boldness that his \ninterrogators quailed. On this day, May 22, 1498, he was interrogated \none last time. Seeing that he could not be moved, his interrogators \nsent him shackled back to his cell and sentenced him to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sentence was carried out the next day. Savonarola and two friars \nwere hanged and burned. Scoffers shouted, \"If you can work miracles, \nwork one now!\" After he was dead, his hand flew up, two fingers \nextended, as if blessing the crowd.

    "title": "SEMI-ARIANS RIDICULED FOR THEIR \"DATED\" CREED",
    "words": "May 22, 359 \u0014\n\u0014\nSemi-Arians Ridiculed for Their \"Dated\" Creed\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the greatest wars of all times was fought with pens and \nspeeches, councils, ridicule and exile. It was the battle to define \nthe central doctrine of Christianity: who Christ is in relation to \nGod the Father. The battles raged for most of the fourth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nArius claimed that Christ was a created being. \"There is a time when \nChrist was not,\" he said. This view became known as Arianism. The \ncouncil of Nicea rejected it. Christ is of the same substance and \nessence as God the Father; in other words, Christ is God, said the \ndelegates.\u0014\n\u0014\nArius had gained a strong following. Although the Emperor Constantine \nhad supported the creed of Nicea while he lived, some of his \nsuccessors did not. They fell under the spell of Arian advisors. \nArians appointed their own bishops throughout the empire and so \nArianism maintained a strong footing.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there were many voices raised for unity. They felt that the \nempire could tear itself apart over theology. As crazy as it may \nsound, theologians tried to work out formulas which would satisfy \nboth sides. Logically, Christ either is truly God who took on the \nform of a man, or he is a created being. If he is \"almost God\" or \nsome other in-between being, then he is not God, but a created being. \nThe formulas tried to get around this with vague wording.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne attempt at compromise took place on this day, May 22, 359 at \nSirmium in the eastern empire. A council which did not represent the \nentire church, consisting mostly of a number of Bishops who leaned \ntoward Arianism, issued a creed. While on the surface it condemned \nArianism, it objected to the Creed of Nicea for saying that Christ \nwas of the same essence as God the Father. Christ, said this new \ncreed, was begotten of the Father--but how or when we do not know. \nJesus is only like God, it said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the writers of the creed made a tactical mistake. In their \npreface, they stated \"The Catholic [Universal] Faith was published \n... on May 22.\" This opened them to ridicule. The faith had already \nbeen around for three centuries. Those who favored the Nicean creed \nwith its clear statement of Christ's divinity, heaped ridicule on the \ncreed, nicknaming it the \"Dated Creed.\" That is the name it goes by \nto this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nPressures for unity were great, starting with the emperor on down. \nAnd so churches east and west signed on to the new creed, although \nsome made changes in its wording first. On the whole, the Dated Creed \nwasn't much different than the Nicean creed, except in a few lines. \nHowever, the Dated Creed did not stand. Athanasius, Bishop of \nAlexandria, and other pro-Nicean theologians refused to accept any \ncompromise that made the Son less than equal to God the Father.

    "words": "She's 10 and May Be Sold to a Brothel\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\nKOLKATA, India  June 1, 2011, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nM. is an ebullient girl, age 10, who ranks near the top of her \nfourth-grade class and dreams of being a doctor. Yet she, like all of \n\\India, is at a turning point, and it looks as if her family may \ninstead sell her to a brothel. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer mother is a prostitute here in Kolkata, the city better known to \nthe world as Calcutta. Ruchira Gupta, who runs an organization called \nApne Aap that fights human trafficking, estimates that 90 percent of \nthe daughters of Indian prostitutes end up in the sex trade as well. \nAnd M. has the extra burden that she belongs to a subcaste whose \ngirls are often expected to become prostitutes. \u0014\n\u0014\nM. seemed poised to escape this fate with the help of one of my \nheroes, Urmi Basu, a social worker who in 2000 started the New Light \nshelter program for prostitutes and their children. \u0014\n\u0014\nM., with her winning personality and keen mind, began to bloom with \nthe help of New Light. Both her parents are illiterate, but she \nlearned English and earned excellent grades in an English-language \nschool for middle-class children outside the red-light district. I'm \nconcealing her identity to protect her from gibes from schoolmates. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, brains and personality aren't always enough, and India \nis the center of the 21st-century slave trade. This country almost \ncertainly has the largest number of human-trafficking victims in the \nworld today. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf M. is sold to a brothel, she will have no defense against H.I.V. \nand other sexually transmitted diseases. Decisions about using a \ncondom are made by the customer or the brothel owner, not by the \ngirl. In one brothel I slipped into to conduct some interviews, there \nwas not a single condom available. \u0014\nThe police make more effort to help girls like M. than they did a few \nyears ago, and in a column a week ago \\I described a police raid on a \nbrothel and the rescue of girls inside ages 5, 10 and 15. Yet the \npolice force's progress is uneven, with one prostitute explaining why \nbrothels hide young girls from police: Because when the police come \nthrough, they confiscate the very young girls, and then the brothel \nowners have to pay a bribe to get the girls back from the police. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow at age 10, M. is running out of time. Her parents have pulled her \nout of her school in Kolkata and are sending her back to their native \nvillage hundreds of miles to the west. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur family situation is such that we have to take her back, said \nher mother. She is vague about the reasons, except to say that the \ngirl's grandfather insists upon it. M. has a scholarship through New \nLight to study free in Kolkata, so the cost of M.'s education is not \na factor. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis leaves Basu and me with an extremely bad feeling, fearing that \nonce she is back in the village and away from her protectors at the \nNew Light shelter, her grandfather could sell her to a trafficker for \ntransfer to a red-light district anywhere in India. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we ask M. what she thinks, she looks down and says in a small \nvoice that she worries as well. But she says she will never give up: \nI will not stop my studies, she told me firmly. \u0014\nThen again, she is unlikely to be consulted. And traffickers offer \nfamilies hundreds of dollars for a pretty girl. \u0014\n\u0014\nI'm here in Kolkata with America Ferrera, the actress from Ugly \nBetty, to film a television documentary. Ferrera fell in love with \nM., and M. with Ferrera; they spent much of their time giggling \ntogether. \u0014\nWhen I look at her, I see all the 10-year-old girls I've ever \nknown, Ferrera said. She's bubbly, silly, and optimistic. It would \nbe heartbreaking to lose such a beautiful spirit to a life of \nviolence and prostitution. \u0014\nFerrera, Basu and I jammed into M.'s one-room shack to beg her \nparents to let her stay in school in Kolkata. I'm pleading with \nyou, Basu said. Let your daughter have this opportunity! \u0014\n\u0014\nWe got nowhere. Her parents have bought M. a train ticket back to the \nvillage in a week's time. \u0014\nI don't know how this will end up. Ferrera said she will be writing \nletters to M. in hopes that this may make her family nervous about a \nsale. And Basu is counseling M. on what to do if she is sold to a \ntrafficker. We just don't know what else to do. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I do know is that it is surreal that these scenes are unfolding \nin the 21st century. The peak of the trans-Atlantic slave trade was \nthe 1780s, when just under 80,000 slaves a year were transported from \nAfrica to the New World. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese days, Unicef estimates that 1.8 million children a year enter \nthe commercial sex trade. Multiply M. by 1.8 million, and you \nunderstand the need for a new abolitionist movement.\u0014",

    "words": "Cooperative Baptist Fellowship Seeks Path to Future \u0014\nIrcel Harrison\u0014\nJune 21, 2011 \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nThe Cooperative Baptist Fellowship will meet for its 20th annual \nmeeting in Tampa, Fla., this week. \u0014\nMany of us have been part of the CBF initiative from the beginning, \neven though our employers at the time may have frowned upon it, but \nthat is a story for another time.\u0014\n\u0014\nA 14-member task force is now in the process of gathering input on \nthe future of CBF. They are attempting to address these questions:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. What is the best model of community that fosters missional \ncollaboration rather than competition for resources?\u0014\n\u0014\n2. How can we refocus and streamline organizational structures in \norder to provide leadership and resources for churches and other \nministries to respond more effectively to global challenges?\u0014\n\u0014\n3. How do we help Baptist churches and organizations embrace their \nidentity as partners with this community?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not an easy task, especially since some have tried to hold \nonto the \"movement\" language perhaps in an effort to avoid the fact \nthat CBF has become an organization with all of the challenges and \nburdens that involves.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce a structure is established, it takes on a life of its own.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his blog, Seth Godin recently pointed out the differences of an \norganization, a movement and a philosophy.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said that \"an organization uses structure and resources and power \nto make things happen.\"\u0014\nMovements may use an organization, but they are much more tied to \nemotion. He said that \"movements are more likely to cause widespread \nchange, and they require leaders, not managers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA philosophy is harder to pin down. He suggested that \"a philosophy \ncan survive things that might wipe out a movement and that would \ndecimate an organization.\" A philosophy may ebb and flow, go \nunderground for a while, and then emerge with new approaches and \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis key point was this: \"The trouble kicks in when you think you have \none and you actually have the other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo what is CBF?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt certainly started out as a philosophy (perhaps even a theology) \nthat many could buy into at some level.\u0014\n\u0014\n My personal perception is that CBF moved pretty quickly through the \nmovement phase to an organization that attempted to do more than it \nwas capable of doing because it believed that it had stronger \ngrass-roots support than it actually did.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who could at least assent to a philosophy and were enchanted by \na movement were not really ready to do everything that the \norganization attempted to provide. Many of those who attended early \nmeetings did not or could not follow through.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me share a personal example of overreaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 1990s, many within the CBF family said that what we \nreally needed were new churches. A few \"splits\" had successfully \nevolved into self-sustaining congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us in leadership believed those who carried the \"church \nstarting\" banner. The Tennessee Cooperative Baptist Fellowship \nlaunched into an ambitious initiative to plant new churches. We \ninvested a lot of time and money into that effort.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the day, we could point to only one viable congregation \nthat came out of all the work. Each attempt that failed had its own \nstory and its own lessons to learn. At the end of the day, however, \nwe overreached because we believed our support was deeper than it \nactually was.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy concern for the future of CBF is that many will express their \nhopes, dreams and expectations but that few will step up and help to \nmake these become a reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nI hope that many will provide input to the task force but that they \nwill then be ready to provide the support to make these goals come to \nfruition. It is one thing to build castles in the air; it is another \nto turn them into reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nA philosophy will inspire us, a movement will energize us, but an \norganization needs people who will invest themselves on a daily basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates \nand director of the Murfreesboro Center of Central Baptist \nTheological Seminary.

    "words": "June 8, 1978 \u0014\n\u0014\nSolzhenitsyn's Commencement Speech\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fight for our planet, physical and spiritual, a fight of cosmic \nproportions, is not a vague matter of the future; it has already \nstarted. The forces of evil have begun their decisive offensive. You \ncan feel their pressure, yet your screens and publications are full \nof prescribed smiles and raised glasses. What is the joy about?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThese perceptive and challenging words were uttered by one of the \ngreat Christians of the 20th century in the heart of a commencement \naddress at Harvard University. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was in exile in \nAmerica after suffering years in Communist prison camps for \ncriticizing Stalin. He had found faith in the \"Gulag Archipelago,\" \nthe Soviet Union's cruel prison system which devoured alive millions \nof individuals who opposed or circumvented the atheistic regime.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result of his suffering was a masterly documentary, Gulag \nArchipelago, which exposed the brutality of the Soviet regime. At one \npoint in this massive work he showed how utterly different his \nthought had become from the complacent pleasure-seeking of the West. \n\"Bless you, prison, for having been in my life!\" He could say this \nbecause in prison he had recognized his spiritual danger and found \ntime to consider the claims of God and Christ. \"God of the Universe! \nI believe again! Though I renounced You, You were with me!\" he wrote \nin a poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nSolzhenitsyn's Harvard address was given on this day June 8th, 1978. \nIt was an attack on Western complacency. The speaker was equipped \nwith the lens of one culture to see the essential flaw of another. In \nthe West that flaw was foundering courage. He said: \"A decline in \ncourage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer \nnotices in the West today. The Western world has lost its civic \ncourage ... Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable \namong the ruling and intellectual elite, causing an impression of a \nloss of courage by the entire society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe went on to analyze how legalism has eaten up morality. \"The West \nhas finally achieved the rights of man, and even to excess, but man's \nsense of responsibility to God and society has grown dimmer and \ndimmer. Must one point out that from ancient times a decline in \ncourage has been considered the first symptom of the end?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough greeted by much applause during its delivery, Solzhenitsyn's \nspeech generated considerable adverse commentary in the press. To \nhave survived the Gulag, he must have had to compromise a good deal, \ngrumped critics. So who was he to preach at us? Solzhenitsyn \napparently had expected such a reaction. In the first paragraphs of \nhis speech he commented, \" ... truth seldom is sweet; it is almost \ninvariably bitter. A measure of bitter truth is included in my speech \ntoday, but I offer it as a friend, not as an adversary.\" Long before, \nSolomon said something about that, too. \"The kisses of an enemy may \nbe profuse, but faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMuggeridge, Malcolm. \"Alexander Solzhenitsyn\" inChosen Vessels : \nportraits of ten outstanding Christian men;edited by Charles Turner. \nAnn Arbor, Michigan: Vine Books, 1985. \u0014\nNielsen, Niels C., jr.

    "title": "SHE SHOT HER THREE CHILDREN",
    "words": "Elizabeth Diane Frederickson Downs (born August 7, 1955) is an \nAmerican convicted murderer. She shot her three children, killing \none, and then told police a stranger had attempted to carjack her and \nshot the children. After her conviction in 1984, she was sentenced to \nlife in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nDowns briefly escaped in 1987 and was re-captured.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 19, 1983, Downs shot her three children: Stephen Daniel Downs \n(born 1979, age 4), Cheryl Lynn Downs (born 1976, age 7) and Christie \nAnn Downs (born 1974, age 8). Downs drove the children in the blood \nspattered car to the McKenzie-Willamette Hospital. On arrival Cheryl \nwas already dead. Downs herself had been shot in the left forearm. \nDowns claimed she was carjacked on a rural road near Springfield, \nOregon, by a strange man who shot her and her three children. \nInvestigators, however, became suspicious when they noticed her \nmanner was too calm to have experienced such a traumatic event.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir suspicions heightened when Downs went to see Christie, now \nunable to speak since suffering a stroke, for the first time; \nChristie's eyes glazed over with fear and her heart rate jumped. They \nalso discovered that she called a man in Arizona named Robert \nKnickerbocker immediately upon arriving at the hospital, a man with \nwhom she had been having an affair. The forensic evidence did not \nmatch Downs' story; there was no blood on the driver's side of the \ncar, nor was there any gunpowder residue on the driver's panel. Downs \ndid not tell police she owned a .22 caliber handgun, but both Steve \nDowns (her ex-husband) and Knickerbocker (her boyfriend) said she did \nown one.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigators later discovered she had bought the handgun in Arizona, \nand found unfired casings that had been worked through the same gun \nthat shot the children, although they were unable to find the actual \nweapon. Most damaging, witnesses saw Downs' car being driven very \nslowly toward the hospitalDowns had claimed that she drove there at \nhigh speed after the shooting. Based on this and other evidence, \nDowns was arrested nine months after the event, on February 28, 1984, \nand charged with murder, attempted murder and criminal assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors argued that Downs shot her children to be free of them so \nthat she could continue her affair with Knickerbocker, who had let it \nbe known that he did not want children in his life. Much of the case \nagainst Downs rested on the testimony of surviving daughter Christie \nDowns who, once she had recovered her ability to speak, described how \nher mother shot all three children while parked at the side of the \nroad, then shot herself in the arm. Christie was 8 years old at the \ntime of the murder and 9 years old at the time of the trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nDowns was found guilty on all charges on June 17, 1984, and was \nsentenced to life in prison plus 50 years. Psychologists diagnosed \nDowns with narcissistic, histrionic, and antisocial personality \ndisorders. Most of her sentence is to be served consecutively. The \njudge made it clear that he did not wish Downs ever to regain her \nfreedom.\u0014",

According to the latest State Department statistics, as \nmany as 100,000 people in the United States are in bondage and \nperhaps 27 million people worldwide. The numbers are staggering. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese victims of human trafficking are vulnerable men, women or \nchildren coerced into servitude for sex or labor. They might be \ntransported from Russia to Europe, from the Philippines to Dubai, or \nheld in their hometown. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe stories are heartbreaking. The Cambodian girl sold to a brothel \nwho was stabbed in the eye by the brothels owner when she fought \nback. The Middle Eastern woman hired as a domestic in London whose \nemployers seized her passport and locked her away in the house. The \nteenager in Dallas forced into prostitution. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2000, the United States enacted an antitrafficking law and the \nUnited Nations adopted the Palermo Protocol. Both call for countries \nto criminalize trafficking, punish offenders and provide shelter to \nvictims. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn its 2011 trafficking report, the State Department concluded that \nlast year only 32 of 184 countries fully complied with the standards \nset by the American law. The number on the list of the worst \nviolators rose to 23 from 13. Two close United States allies, Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait, joined that list of shame. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been progress. In the last decade, 146 countries signed the \nprotocol and 128 of those passed laws banning human trafficking. That \nreflects a growing and encouraging acceptance of a problem once \ndenied. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is still much to do. All nations should sign the protocol, pass \ntough national laws and work vigorously to ensure their \nimplementation. Abusers, including firms that hire trafficked \nemployees, must be prosecuted and victims protected. No human being \nshould be enslaved.\u0014",

    "title": "SYBLING RIVALRY--ESAU AND JACOB",
    "words": "Jacob and Esau wrestled with each other from the beginning. And from \nthe day he was born, Jacob was a little bit behind, but always \nstruggling to get ahead -- even if it meant usurping someone else to \ndo it. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, we see that the pre-existing condition of their sibling \nrivalry was fomented by the favoritism cultivated in their home. \nRebekah openly favored Jacob, while Isaac clearly preferred Esau. \nThis, of course, is a recipe for trouble. Perhaps Jesus would have \ncautioned these parents that \"a house divided against itself... will \nnot be able to stand\" (Mark 3:25).\u0014\n\u0014\nWe see from the moment of their birth that these twins are not \nidentical. Tellingly, the biblical author describes Esau's appearance \nand Jacob's behavior. And the stark contrast between them is carried \nout into adulthood, where we see Esau as \"a man of the field\" while \nJacob \"was a quiet man, living in tents.\" The idea of \"living in \ntents,\" of course, sounds rather outdoorsy to us, but within their \ncontext the phrase suggests that Jacob was rather domesticated, \nsomething of a homebody.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we were to put their story on a twenty-first-century stage, we can \nenvision how we might cast and outfit each character. Esau would be \nthe big, burly guy with a face full of beard. The boots and hunting \ngear Esau wears all combine to weigh more than Jacob himself does. \nEsau is a man of simple tastes and straightforward talk. There is no \nshrewdness, no cleverness, no guile in him; he's all gusto and \nstrength. He walks heavily, stands firmly, and talks loudly. He's got \na big body, a big voice, and a big appetite.\u0014\n\u0014\nJacob, on the other hand, is made of finer stuff. He is carefully \ngroomed, and he regards neatness and quietness as virtues. He is \nattentive to his clothing, and so he wears an apron to protect it as \nhe works in the kitchen. He is pensive and articulate. He thinks more \nthan he says. He sometimes struggles to be noticed, but he never \nstruggles to be effective.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they didn't live in the same family, Jacob and Esau wouldn't have \nanything to do with one another. There is nothing about them that \nthey should ever be friends. On the contrary, as siblings in a \nsetting of overt favoritism, there is much about them to make them \nenemies. And so, indeed, they were.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs infants, Esau's strength helped him come out ahead. As adults, \nhowever, Jacob's wits prevailed. And so the guy in the apron bested \nthe guy in the blaze-orange hunting gear. But, of course, the former \nhad a home-field advantage in this matchup: for it took place in the \nkitchen; and in the less straightforward world of negotiation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--David Kalas, Emphasis\u0014",

Some, like William Carey and Henry \nMartyn, followed his footsteps onto the mission field.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of seven David began to seek the Lord. His journal shows \nthat he struggled greatly in coming to Christ. To replace \nself-righteous works by faith seemed to him very difficult to do. He \nfound it hard to prefer God's glory over his own salvation. \nExceedingly scrupulous, depressive, and tubercular his physical \nhealth might well have aggravated his spiritual struggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brainerd found peace at last. It began with an utter sense of \nlostness. \"One morning while I was walking in a solitary place (as \nusual) and came near a thick bunch of hazels, I felt at once \nunusually lost and at the greatest stand and felt that all my \ncontrivances and projections respecting my deliverance and salvation \nwere brought to a final issue.\" From Friday morning through Sunday \nevening he was in the greatest agony of spirit, eventually feeling \nthat the Spirit of God had quite left him. Here is his own account of \nhis subsequent conversion on this day July 12, 1739:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"By this time the sun was scarce half an hour high, as I remember, as \nI was walking in a dark thick grove, \"unspeakable glory\" seemed to \nopen to the view and apprehension of my soul. By the glory I saw I \ndon't mean any external brightness, for I saw no such thing, nor do I \nintend any imagination of a body of light or splendor somewhere away \nin the third heaven, or anything of that nature. But it was a new \ninward apprehension or view that I had of God; such as I never had \nbefore, nor anything that I had the least remembrance of it. I stood \nstill and wondered and admired.\" He came to want to exalt God above \nall things (as had Christ) and remained in great joy for about a week.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrainerd proceeded to enroll and study for his ministerial degree at \nYale. However, he was not allowed to receive the degree he earned, \nhaving commented that one teacher had no more grace than a chair. He \nswore he had no recollection of making the remark but, offered, \nnonetheless to apologize. This was refused. Three professors who \nstood behind him resigned and helped found Princeton.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brainerd was, nonetheless, commissioned by the Scotland Society \nfor the Propagation of Christian Knowledge as a missionary to the \nIndians. He labored for about three years among several tribes until \nill-health forced him to leave. Engaged to marry one of Jonathan \nEdward's daughters, he was nursed in the preacher's home and died \nthere October 9, 1747. Edwards preached Brainerd's funeral service \nand edited his journal with comments of his own under the title The \nLife of David Brainerd.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Brainerd, David.\" Dictionary of American Biography.New York: \nScribner, 1958-1964.\u0014\nEdwards, Jonathan.

And his wife's \nWhite House staff has been increased by tenfold. She has tenfold more \npeople working for her than any other first lady in history. And all \nthese czars that he's appointed, the White House administrative \nbudget is higher than it's been under any other president.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He ought to live like a country that's got a debt crisis instead of \nliving like a playboy,\" Land added.\u0014\n\u0014\nLand provided no support for his claims about White House spending, \nbut independent fact-checking organizations had previously debunked \nthe claims that have been circulated via emails and Glenn Beck.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this month, FactCheck.org debunked the chain email claim that \nObama has traveled more than any other president. The group examined \nboth number of missions (round trips from Andrews Air Force Base and \nback) and \"sorties\" (individual flights between landings within each \nmission).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe investigation found that Obama actually flew fewer missions and \nsorties than his immediate predecessor in the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[I]n his first two years, Bush took 148 missions with 416 sorties, \ncompared with 126 missions with 324 sorties for Obama over two \nyears,\" FactCheck.org explained.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These latest chain emails are part of a continuing pattern of \nindignant, anonymous authors spreading false and misleading claims \nabout the travels of the president and the first lady.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitifact.com, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its political \nfact-checking reports, debunked the claim about Michelle Obama's \nstaff after Glenn Beck made the accusation back in February. The \nclaim was rated as \"Pants on Fire,\" the worst rating a claim can \nreceive.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolitifact.com found that Michelle Obama's staff was the same size as \nLaura Bush's staff at the end of George W. Bush's presidency.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The size of Michelle Obama's staff is similar to that of her \nimmediate predecessors,\" Politifact.com concluded. \"In short, Beck's \noutrage is based on numbers that are wildly off the mark. We rate his \nclaim Pants on Fire.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the claims about the so-called \"czars,\" FactCheck.org found \nthat George W. Bush actually appointed more czars during his \npresidency than Barack Obama has appointed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Richard Land is incorrect about President Obama's travel and the \nsize of Mrs. Obama's staff, according to highly reputable \norganizations,\" said Robert Parham, executive director of the Baptist \nCenter for Ethics. \"These are egregious errors. But his assertion \nthat the president lives like a playboy is strikingly shameful and \ncompletely unacceptable for a Christian minister.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Frank Page, the SBC's chief executive officer, and Bryan Wright, the \nSBC's elected president, should insist that Land publicly apologize \nfor his malicious playboy statement and correct the record,\" said \nParham. \"They should issue a letter of apology to the president. \nUnless they distance themselves and the SBC from such statements, \nthen they allow Land to present Southern Baptists as a malicious and \nuntruthful people. If they are silent, then they make a mockery of \nthe 2011 SBC resolution calling for civility in public discourse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLast month, messengers to the SBC annual meeting passed a resolution \n\"On Civil Public Discourse\" that denounced \"speech or activities of \nany individual or group that brings shame upon the name of Christ and \nHis gospel\" and urged Baptists \"to speak biblically and \nauthoritatively with conviction, kindness, and gentleness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLand frequently resorts to name-calling against those he disagrees \nwith politically. In 2008, Land used an obscene Yiddish slur during a \nchapel address at Criswell College to mock U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, \nwho is Jewish.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter receiving criticism for the remark, Land claimed \"ignorance\" of \nthe word's meaning and apologized.\u0014\n\u0014\nLand has also compared Hillary Clinton to a witch and used animal \nnoises to mock Al Gore.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrian Kaylor is a contributing editor for EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

Massive amounts of water spilled over the top of the \ngiant falls and dropped almost a thousand feet; the roar was \ndeafening. The falls are the largest in the world, more than a mile \nwide and three hundred feet high. Mist from the spray that fills the \nair like fog can be seen for fifty miles; the locals call it \"Smoke \nThat Thunders.\" The water from the falls rushes down the gorge in \ntorrents, creating the world's largest rapids. In the United States, \nthe highest-class rapid you are allowed to raft is a Class 5. The \nZambezi's whitewater rapids can top 7 and 8 . \u0014\n\u0014\nAs I sat on the edge of the eight-person raft, all suited up in a \ntight, overstuffed jacket and a thick crash helmet, I felt like an \novercautious tourist about to mount an overpowered moped in Honolulu \nor rent roller-blades on Huntington Beach. The Zambezi can't be that \ndangerous, can it?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then our guide [said], \"When the raft flips \" There was no \"If \nthe raft flips\" or \"Or on the off chance we get flipped.\" But \"When \nthe raft flips.\" He went on, \" stay in the rough water.

    "title": "SALVATION FOR THE JEWS ACCORDING TO PAUL",
    "words": "Romans 11:1-2a, 29-32\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this letter to Gentile believers in Jesus, Paul is intent on \ncorrecting misimpressions of his teaching and gospel. One of those \nmisimpressions is that Paul preaches a gospel that excludes Jews, as \nfollowers of the law, from the salvation offered by God. In chapters \n9-11 Paul is attempting to work out the dynamics of this mystery in \nwhich the Gentiles are grafted into the vine of God without severing \nthe Jewish root.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditional theology has come to the text with a set of assumptions \nnot predicated on this text. That set of assumptions understands that \nJesus is not only God's means of inclusion for the Gentiles, but that \nsomehow God's covenant with the Jews has been superseded and replaced \nby the necessity of a Christ-centered inclusion for the Jews as well. \nTraditional theology has read the ultimate inclusion of the Jews as a \ntime when they would accept Christ and thereby become a part of the \nchurch. It cannot be emphasized enough that Paul says neither of \nthese things, either here or anywhere else in his writings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the beginning of chapter 11 the question is asked, either by Paul \nor by his fictive conversation partner, \"Based on all that was said \nin the previous two chapters, has God rejected his people?\" Paul \nresponds in the strongest possible terms, \"Absolutely not!\" He \nidentifies himself as an Israelite with an unassailable pedigree and \nstates again that God has not rejected his covenant people, the Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere seems to me to be very sound theological grounds upon which we \nwould want to affirm Paul's insistence that God is not a \ncovenant-breaker. If the nature of God is such that he can (and in \nthis instance does) decide to change the rules of covenant, then what \nassurance do we have that God will not change the rules yet again, \nonly this time leaving the worshipers of Christ as the outsiders \nneeding to adjust their covenantal understandings with God's new \nreality? To claim that Jesus is clearly prophesied in the Hebrew \nscripture and therefore that the Jews should have been ready for the \nMessianic advent is to read those scriptures through the lenses of \nChristianity and not as they would have been normatively understood. \nWe must approach this text in a way that honors the trustworthiness \nof the covenant-making God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat seems to be exactly what Paul is doing. Although what God has \ndone and is doing remains a mystery to him, Paul is unwilling to \naffirm anything less than the inviolability of God's covenant with \nGod's people, \"for the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable\" (v. \n29).\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul does not try to explain the \"why\" of God's actions to use first \nthe Jews and then the Gentiles to make the other jealous. Nor is Paul \ncompletely clear on how it will all work out. He is certain, however, \nabout a couple of things. First, he is certain that through Jesus \nGentiles have standing before God and that it is unnecessary, even \nundesirable, for Gentiles to find their way to God through \nTorah-based Judaism. For the Gentiles, Jesus is the sufficient means \nfor acceptance by God (salvation). Second, Paul is certain that the \ncovenant made between God and the Jewish people is still in effect. \nTorah-keeping remains a legitimate means by which the Jews can \nexpress their covenant connection with God. God may favor one for the \nsake of the other or favor the other for the sake of the one, but \nthat is God's business and Paul confesses his ignorance in unraveling \nthat mystery (v. 33). Note that nowhere in this passage does Paul \nindicate explicitly or implicitly that the salvation of the Jews will \nbe dependent upon anything other than their obedience to Torah. To \nread this otherwise is to read it with a certain Christian assumption \nand presumption.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is God's desire to be merciful to all (v. 32) -- we would do well \nto follow God's lead.\u0014\n\u0014\nRomans 11 offers us an equally difficult challenge of reconciliation \n-- that is reconciliation with divine mystery. We only like the types \nof mysteries in which the enigma is resolved by the end of the story. \nMysteries that leave us hanging with unresolved questions and unclear \ncertainties are not only uncomfortable for us, but lead us to \nconstruct our own story endings. If God is unclear about certain \nmatters, then we will make up our own theology and act as though it \nis the word of God. After all, faith is the assurance of things \nknown, the evidence of things visible, right? We want certitude, \nfinality, clarity, if for no other reason than to assure ourselves \nthat we are right and others are less so.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul provides for us an example of one who can reconcile himself to \ndivine mystery and still trust God's action in Christ. The Jews \nworship and believe differently than Paul's community; yet they are \nirrevocably the people of God. Paul's community comes at faith in God \napart from Torah observance, yet they too are the people of God. Paul \navoids the temptation to solve God's dilemma for God and reconciles \nhimself to divine mystery, leaving it to God to work out the details. \nSometimes the most difficult three words for a follower of Christ to \nutter are \"I don't know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSCHUYLER RHODES, Emphasis\u0014",

    "title": "STRESS IN PASTORAL MINISTRY",
    "words": "In his book 5 Ministry Killers, Charles Stone tells the story of a \npastor named Jonathan, who spent 23 years as a pastor in New England. \nHe \"faced everything from power struggles to salary controversies to \nquestions about his leadership. Once, he confronted some boys in the \nchurch after they had taunted several young girls with suggestive \ncomments. His handling of the situation outraged the boys' parents \nand fueled their resistance toward him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Another issue swirled around his visitation policy. He knew his \ngreatest primary gifts were preaching and teaching rather than \ntraditional pastoral ones. So in contrast to what was considered \ncustomary, he chose to make a visit only when an emergency arose. \nHowever, many members began to fault him for 'not loving the people,' \nwhich further increased church dissatisfaction...\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One final matter became the proverbial straw that broke the camel's \nback. The previous pastor had loosely allowed unbelievers to become \nmembers, and Jonathan later became aware that several of those \nmembers had flagrantly sinned. In their small community, these sins \nhad become quite public, and because he believed that only believers \nwho evidenced a changed life should join the church, he began to \nchange the policy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A firestorm erupted, and Jonathan knew that were he to stand firm on \nhis convictions, he could lose his pastorate. However, he stood his \nground, and the inevitable occurred. They fired him; and at age 46, \nhe found himself unemployed. The rejection became so intense that the \nagricultural town forbad him to use common grazing land for his farm \nanimals...\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ten years later, because Jonathan had so graciously responded to his \ncritics and his dismissal, one of his main detractors admitted that \npride, self-sufficiency, ambition and vanity had caused the \ncontention. The pastor's handling of his ministry crisis left such an \nimpression that eventually the church publicly repented of their \nactions, exactly 150 years after they sent him packing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn case you haven't figured it out yet, that pastor who was so \nmaligned and misused was Jonathan Edwards, one of the pivotal figures \nin the First Great Awakening, and likely America's greatest \ntheologian.\u0014",

Gandhi is particularly \ndisliked by Dalits (untouchables), the lowest and poorest of the \ncaste groupsthe very group whose concerns Gandhi carried most \npersistently, if patronizingly, through much of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Aravind Adiga's novel The White Tiger, posters of Gandhi decorate \na corrupt official's wall. The Chinese premier, to whom protagonist \nBalram addresses the book, will be met at the airport with garlands \nand \"small take-home sandalwood statues of Gandhi.\" The thought of \nthat gift prompts Balram to \"say that thing in English,\" a sentiment \nhe claims only English can convey: \"What a f_____ joke.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi's legacy is complicated, and so was the man himself: \nprincipled and yet self-contradicting, dedicated to the poor while \nout of touch with the reality of their lives, willing to die for \ntruth and yet prone to rationalize, humble but insufferably sure of \nhis rightness. Joseph Lelyveld, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist \nand former executive editor of the New York Times, thoroughly \nexplores Gandhi's complex and ambiguous history in a rich and \ntextured biography. He helps you understand why Gandhi was adored as \nfew saints (and fewer politicians) ever have been; and also why he \nwas thoroughly despised.\u0014\n\u0014\nGandhi launched his campaign for independence in 1915 on returning \nfrom South Africa, where he had lived almost all his adult life, and \ncarried it on to his death in 1948. His approach was built on four \npillars: Muslim-Hindu unity, the end of untouchability, nonviolence \nas a way of life, and (improbably) homespun yarn and handwoven \nfabrics as a self-sustaining cottage industry for India's villages. \nNone of these was accomplished. His three decades of leadership left \nhardly a tangible trace on modern India.\u0014",

Pamela had a troubled childhood and ended up turning \nto drugs to numb the pain of her daily struggles. In 1980, Pamela hit \nan all time low when she committed two murders while she was under \nthe influence. Pamela ended up being sentenced to the death penalty \nas punishment for her crimes. Shortly after Pamela was imprisoned, \nshe found the Lord and was saved. She felt remorse for her sins and \nasked for forgiveness. Throughout the years, Pamela would fight to \nchange her death penalty sentence and would also fight to spread the \nword of Jesus Christ. She ended up being successful in both areas and \nshe escaped death row in exchange for a lifetime imprisonment. At the \ntime this book was published, Pamela had been in jail for almost 40 \nyears and she is hoping for parole in 2019.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod can use anyone to bring others to Him. Pamela has defeated the \nodds. She has used a terrible situation for the good of the Lord. She \nhas truly been changed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Reading Pamela's \nstory will help readers to be more open-minded and aware that we all \nhave fallen short. We all have sinned and we are broken. But in the \nend, evil does not win. GOD WINS. Pamela is very brave to share her \nstory and strive to move on from her troubled past and move forward \nto fulfill God's plan for her life. \u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nA childhood of dysfunction and sexual abuse, led to Pamela Perillo \nmaking decisions one of which would lead to her being put on Death \nRow.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of nine her Mother never came home from work, after her \nolder sister left shed be the one Little Joe (her Father) Molested. \nA series of runaways would lead her to Juvenile Hall where she was \nintroduced to drugs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt sixteen she would give birth to a daughter, who would die four \nmonths later when Pamela was seventeen.

His \ncongregation had grown so large they had to erect this special \nbuilding to accommodate the crowds who came to hear him. While it was \nbeing built, he rented a hall in Surrey Gardens. At 22 years old, he \nhad already been preaching five years. An overflow crowd filled the \nSurrey Garden hall. As he prayed aloud, pranksters yelled, \"Fire,\" \nand shouted that the balcony was about to collapse. In a panic, \npeople surged toward the exits. Seven people were trampled to death \nand dozens more taken to hospital badly injured.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurgeon collapsed in horror. He had to be carried from the pulpit \nand fell into such deep depression that he later said he doubted \nanyone had ever passed as close to madness as he and yet escaped with \nsanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Tabernacle opened in March 1861. There Spurgeon preached to 6,000 \nevery Sunday for thirty years. That was no mean feat in the days \nbefore microphones and was possible only because the Lord endowed him \nwith a commanding voice. From the pulpit, Spurgeon expounded the \ntruths of scripture in a clear and distinct, if showy, style. Each \nweek one of his sermons was published. He quoted frequently from the \nworld's great literature. More importantly, he preached Christ Jesus. \nIn one of the first sermons he preached in the Tabernacle, he \ndeclared, \"If I am asked what is my creed, I must reply, It is Jesus \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis showmanship was criticized as irreverent. Spurgeon pointed out \nthat through it souls were won. The Lord had called him to preach to \nthe lower classes, and he must present the gospel in a manner they \ncould understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor his final talk, Spurgeon described what it is to have Christ as \nour captain. He amplified on the story of David at Ziklag. David and \nhis men had returned to find their city burnt and their wives and \nchildren taken captive. His men wanted to stone him. But David \nstrengthened himself in the Lord, and under his leadership, the men \nrecaptured their wives and children. At that time, David stood up for \nsome exhausted men who had stayed behind guarding the baggage. \nChrist, said Spurgeon, is like David. He stands up for the weak.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are all one in Christ Jesus. Surely this ought to comfort those \nof you who, by reason of feebleness, are made to feel as if you were \ninferior members of the body ... \" Spurgeon showed that David \nattributed recovery of their families to the Lord and drew this \nconclusion: \"If it is all of free grace, then, my poor struggling \nbrother, who can hardly feel assured that you are saved, yet if you \nare a believer, you may claim every blessing of the Lord's gracious \ncovenant.\" Christ, the Son of David, is \"the most magnanimous of \ncaptains.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBoreham, F.

    "title": "SECRETARIAT--LIKE A TREMENDOUS MACHINE",
    "words": "Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte reflecting on one of the great \nathletic feats of all time, human or equine, when Secretariat moved \nlike a tremendous machine in 1973.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Ron Turcotte with Tom Pedulla\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew the 1973 Belmont Stakes was going to be a special day for \nSecretariat. The only question was how special.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had won the Kentucky Derby with a phenomenal performance, \ntraveling faster every quarter in tearing through the mile and a \nquarter in a track-record 1:59 2/5 to defeat Sham. I made sure to \ngive him an easy race in the Preakness; he was still 2  lengths \nbetter than Sham. It definitely could have been much more, but my \nthought was to save as much as possible for the Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrainer Lucien Laurin worked Secretariat hard for the last leg of the \nTriple Crown, leaving nothing to chance. I was aboard for those \ndrills and liked everything about them. He was thriving on a heavy \nworkload, eating everything put in front of him and he was loaded \nwith energy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe morning after his final workout, he was so much on the muscle we \ndecided to put the tack on him and walk him around the shedrow to \nsettle him down. Then the morning of the Belmont, when we walked him \nagain for 30 minutes, he was rearing on his hind legs and trying to \nget away from exercise rider Charlie Davis, who was doing his best to \nhold onto him. That was the fittest I had ever seen him and we knew \nhe was eager to run.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know strange things can happen in a race, but I could not have been \nmore confident. After the last work, I told Lucien, If he gets \nbeaten in this race, I'm going to hang up my tack.\u0014\n\u0014\nI always looked at the Belmont as the easiest of the three legs. If \nyour horse stumbles, if he gets shut off, the mile-and-a-half \ndistance gives you time to recover. That being said, I sure hoped for \na clean trip.\u0014\n\u0014\nLucien did not give me any instructions in the paddock before the \nrace. He never did. All he said was, Ronnie, you know the horse. You \nknow what to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy plan was to sit behind Sham in the early going. That changed when \nI felt the power beneath me and Secretariat broke sharply. I let him \nget his feet under him and picked his head up entering the first turn.\u0014\n\u0014\nSham and jockey Laffit Pincay decided to try to stay with us early, \nbut I knew there was no way Sham could stay with Secretariat, whose \ntremendous stride allowed him to cover a great amount of ground. I \nnever felt such strength under me as I did that day. We were flying \nalong. We covered the opening half-mile in 46 1/5 seconds, \nthree-quarters in 1:09 4/5 and the mile in 1:34 4/5.\u0014\n\u0014\nLucien and others in the stands thought I was crazy. But I am the one \non the horse. I knew he was well within himself. He was doing \neverything easily. His stride was beautiful. His breathing was good. \nEverything was going to my liking. My job, as I saw it, was to be a \ngood passenger and stay out of his way. The only encouragement I gave \nhim was to occasionally whisper in his ear. Easy boy, I would tell \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew we were putting Sham and the rest far behind us with \nSecretariat's long, loping strides. I knew he was going to have no \ntrouble getting the mile and a half. I peeked and the other horses \nmust have been 15-20 lengths behind.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, the only race was against the clock. After the Preakness timing \ncontroversy, I wanted Secretariat to set a record that would stand a \nlong time. With 70 yards to go, I chirped to him to make sure he did \nnot lose focus. He responded by finding still another gear.\u0014\n\u0014\nSure that the race was won, that Secretariat would be the first \nTriple Crown winner in 25 years, I was able to soak in everything. \nThe crowd that was going wild. The teletimer. Track announcer Chic \nAnderson's memorable race call.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecretariat is widening now. He is moving like a tremendous machine!\u0014\nWhen I peeked that last time, it was not to see where the other \nhorses were. I was looking for the time. When I finally pulled up \nSecretariat and the outrider came to meet us, he said, Do you know \nhow fast you went?\u0014\n\u0014\nYup, 2:24 flat.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not one to draw attention to myself. But I was so touched by the \nexcitement of the fans after our 31-length romp that I took off my \nhelmet several times and bowed to acknowledge them. Each time, they \nexploded.\u0014\n\u0014\nEddie Sweat, the groom, and Lucien greeted us when we returned to the \nwinner's circle. Incredibly, Secretariat was not blowing hard. He was \nnot perspiring at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did I tell you, Lucien? We did it! I exclaimed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe record, of course, still stands. There was not a horse in the \nworld that could have beaten Secretariat that day.\u0014",

With their own hands they fed \ncrowds of poor people.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the leading lady of Scotland, she set an example of holiness and \npersonal worship for the court. Many of the ladies of the court \nimitated her behavior. At her patient insistence, Sunday became the \nday of rest and worship that it was meant to be. She set an example \nof charity by personally taking in at least nine orphans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore Margaret came to Scotland, ignorance ruled the land. Religious \nobservances had slipped into error. At her insistence, a synod \n(council of church leaders) corrected the abuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gracious queen loved to read, especially the gospels, with their \nglorious tale of God giving up glory that mankind might find it. An \nilluminated gospel that she treasured survives today. She sponsored \nnew churches and improved existing ones so that the people might be \nattracted to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret loved color and soft cloth. She imported skilled workers to \ntrain the Scots to make such cloth. In this way, clan tartans owe \ntheir origin to her.\u0014\n\u0014\nMalcolm and Margaret had six sons and two daughters whom she reared \nin her faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn light of Margaret's remarkable story, we must believe that it was \nno mere chance that sent her to Scotland. Clearly God meant for her \nto perform a missionary work, and she fulfilled her responsibility. \nThat is why a feast is held for her on this day, June 10, each year.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Alban.

    "words": "Separating Families Causes Life-Long Trauma \nfor Kids \u0014\n                             Mitch Randall  Tuesday, June 19, 2018 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese children are innocent victims being held in facilities that are \ndetrimental to their cognitive and emotional futures, Randall writes. \n(Photo: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe indigenous peoples of the U.S. were forced to relocate to Indian \nTerritory after President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal \nAct in 1830.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe removal and relocation policy toward Native peoples led to \nthousands of brown-skinned children and adults perishing on their \nforced march to Indian Territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nNative peoples, my people, called this federally sponsored death \nmarch the Trail of Tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased upon this legislation, U.S policy enhanced its attacks on \nNative peoples. In an attempt to \"Americanize\" Native Americans, the \nU.S government began instituting policies that were harmful to \nindigenous families.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. Training and Industrial School was founded in 1870, becoming \nthe model for other schools across the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept was that if Native children were removed from their \nfamilies, they could be cleansed of their \"savage\" impurities and \ninstilled with \"American\" values.\u0014\n\u0014\nCapt. Richard Pratt founded the first school in Carlisle, \nPennsylvania. He coined the practice \"kill the Indian to save the \nchild.\" He based this evil idea on colonial policies and practices \ntoward African slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the turn of the 20th century, two little girls from the Muscogee \nCreek people were taken from their families and placed at one of \nthese government facilities known as the Chilocco Indian Agricultural \nSchool.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir names were Eloise and Ruby Boutinot. Eloise was my \ngreat-grandmother.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder this \"America First\" philosophy, which really could be \ninterpreted as \"White America First,\" the girls were stripped of \ntheir cultural identities.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir hair was cut, they were forced to speak exclusively English and \nmade to attend church service at least once a week.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf they spoke their native language or skipped church, they were \nwhipped for their \"misdeeds\" by Christian missionaries funded by the \nfederal government. Separated from their families, the girls were \nscared and traumatized.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis brings me to the circumstances unfolding at the U.S. southern \nborder. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently announced a \nzero-tolerance policy toward another brown-skinned people and that \ntheir children would be separated from their families.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the situations regarding Native Americans and immigrants are \ndifferent, there remains a commonalty concerning the long-term \ndamages caused by separating children from their families' causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore we move forward, we need to understand the difference between \nan early situation under another administration and the current one.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the previous children arrived at the border and were housed at \nthe Texas detention center, they arrived alone fleeing from violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe current children arrived at the border with their parents. \nAnother difference is that the current administration is \nstrategically separating families as a deterrent for potential \nundocumented immigrants.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttorney General Sessions went as far as evoking Romans 13 as \njustification for this new policy of separating families. Many \ntheologians and faith leaders have condemned Sessions for his \nmisapplication of the biblical text.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the condemnation was much needed, there is something else at \nplay besides theological malpractice. A modern-day trail of tears is \nunderway.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. government, our government, is traumatizing children in an \nattempt to discourage future immigrants from entering the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet that sink into your soul. The policies and procedures of the U.S. \ngovernment are contributing to the trauma of innocent children.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of what one thinks about the guilt or innocence of their \nparents, these children are innocent victims being held in facilities \nthat are detrimental to their cognitive and emotional futures.\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer First Lady Laura Bush commented, \"I appreciate the need to \nenforce and protect our international boundaries, but this \nzero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my \nheart.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nComparing this situation to the Japanese internment camps during \nWorld War II, Bush argues this type of policy causes life-long damage \nto children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBush's concerns about the negative impact on children must be central \nto reforming our nation's immigration system and ceasing immediately \nthe practice of separating children from parents at the border.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy separating children from their families and holding them in \nprison-like detention centers, we are exposing them to the \npossibility of developing a number of conditions, including anxiety, \ndepression, post-traumatic stress disorder or reactive attachment \ndisorder (RAD).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Mayo Clinic defines RAD as follows, \"Reactive attachment disorder \nis a rare but serious condition in which an infant or young child \ndoesn't establish healthy attachments with parents or caregivers. \nReactive attachment disorder may develop if the child's basic needs \nfor comfort, affection and nurturing aren't met, and loving, caring, \nstable attachments with others are not established.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you catch that last part? \"Reactive attachment disorder may \ndevelop if the child's basic needs for comfort, affection and \nnurturing aren't met, and loving, caring, stable attachments with \nothers are not established.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, this is different from other previous situations because those \nchildren arrived alone without families. These children arrive with \ntheir families and are being taken away by our government.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo we really want to be part of a country that contributes to this \ntype of trauma? Again, this is not about illegal activities of \nadults, but about U.S. policies and procedures that are inflicting \ntrauma on innocent children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere must be a better way.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile immigrants have been crossing the border for two centuries \nwithout documentation, the time has arrived for our government to \nfigure out a better way to care for these children.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, for those children who have parents in custody, separating \nthem should never be the first consequence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, for those children who are alone and without close U.S. \nrelatives to care for them, these children should be placed in a home \nsetting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, people of faith need to step up to offer their homes and \nresources for these children.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, the government needs policies and procedures that place \ndecency and humanity over political grandstanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Jesus-followers seeking to promote and practice the common good, \nwe must always remember the words of Jesus, \"Truly I tell you, just \nas you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my \nfamily, you did it to me\" (Matthew 25:45).\u0014\n\u0014\nImmigrant children are considered part of the Lord's family. \nTherefore, we are responsible for their care.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us learn from our past mistakes and let's do better! These \nchildren deserve love and support, just like our own children.\u0014\n\\\u0002Mitch Randall is executive director of EthicsDaily.com\u0014",

    "title": "STEAL AWAY, A RECOUNT OF THE SLAVES' JOURNEY",
    "words": "Steal Away -  Ed Guthero\u0014\n\u0014\nAfrican slaves trapped in the hell of American slavery embraced \nChristian faith amid the paradoxes, as their captors spoke of a new \nnation with equality and liberty for all men. Unfortunately, the \nliberty wasnt for them. The repercussions echo down to us today . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nMississippi, 1830s\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stifling humidity hangs heavy in the late-night Southern air. \nSlipping in and out of shadows, a small group of plantation slaves \nmove silently through the woods. Much is at stake: it is far past \ncurfew, assembly is strictly prohibited, and retribution would be \nbrutally enforced. They must not be discovered. Yet something more \npowerful than the overseers lash draws them deep into the woods this \nnight.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon, huddled behind quilts and rags roughly hung to resemble a small \ntabernacle, or hush arbor, they will conduct a clandestine church \nservice. The makeshift materials have been painstakingly dampened to \nmuffle the sound of voices from carrying on the night air. Caution is \nparamount.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe encouraging words of a slave preacher, the heartfelt prayers, the \nsoft sounds of song simultaneously praise and plea, transport them \naway from bondage and fill their hearts with hope. They defy the \nrisks for such moments and the dream of freedom. Earlier that \nafternoon, men, women, and children had toiled in the blazing sun \nwhile methodically moving through the planted rows during the \nback-breaking labor of picking cotton.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lone voice, conveying both praise and code, would often rise above \nthe sounds of shuffling feet in the fields and the steely gaze of the \noverseers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus! . . . I aint got long \nto stay here. Other voices joined, defying the drudgery, often in \nthe call and response mode that infused these songs of spirit with a \ncommunal transcendent fullness.\u0014\nThere would be a secret service that night.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlave Eli Johnson stated that when he was threatened with multiple \nlashes for holding prayer meetings, he stood up to his master and \ndeclared, Ill suffer the flesh to be dragged off my bones . . . for \nthe sake of my blessed Redeemer.\u0014\nNot all plantation owners were as unforgivingsome allowed open \nservices. Yet, while a slave service may have been allowed on a \ncertain plantation, on a neighboring one conducting such a gathering \nwould get a participant cruelly whipped or worse. Still, they \ngathered. In the midst of oppression, captive slaves, despite seeing \nthe blatant hypocrisy of their masters actions, had come to seek \nsolace and hope in the Christian religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nShort decades before, as Americas Founders forged a new nation built \non principles of equality and freedom, the practice of slavery \ncoexisted with the words of liberty that echoed through the halls of \nthe Continental Congress. It was an unholy irony then and continued \nto be as the institution persisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the paradoxical world of Colonial America slavery was at the heart \nof a massive economy based on human bondage for profit. As profits \nmounted, blind spots were everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1776 African Americans, victims of the brutal Atlantic slave \ntrade, comprised approximately 20 percent of the entire population of \nthe 13 Colonies. As historian James Norton has said: Slavery wasnt \na side show in American history; it was the main event.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the end of the French and Indian War, Britain had decided \nto maintain the expense of keeping 10,000 troops in the Colonies. A \nseries of heavy taxes were pressed upon the Colonies leading up to \nthe American Revolution: The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Tea Tax of \n1773 stirred strong feelings of unfair taxation without \nrepresentation. The infamous Boston Massacre of 1770, during which \nfive colonists were killed by British soldiers in an angry mob \nconfrontation, fueled the flames of revolt. Talk of freedom, liberty, \nand independence from Britain electrified the Colonies and spread \nlike wildfire.\u0014\nSlaves heard the stirring talk of liberty and dared to hope it \nincluded them, but they were caught in the middle, still considered \nas property. Yet the irony of a fledgling nation seeking its own \nliberty while keeping others in bondage was not lost on them. Many \ncolonists as well were uncomfortable with the dichotomy, and the \nnations Founders, a majority of whom owned slaves, wrestled with the \nincongruence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1774, two years before Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of \nIndependence, an educated former slave from Boston, Prince Hall, \npetitioned the Massachusetts military governor, seeking the abolition \nof slavery. Again in 1777, Hall and seven others elegantly presented \ntheir casea virtual Black Declaration of Independence, stating that \nthey have in common with all other men: a natural and inalienable \nright to that freedom which the Great Parent of the Universe has \nbestowed equally on all mankind, and that every principle from \nwhich America has acted in the course of their unhappy difficulties \nwith Great Britain pleads stronger than a thousand arguments in \nfavour of [the anti-slavery] petitioners, and they therefore humbly \nbeseech that Your Honours give this petition its due weight and \nconsideration and cause an act of the legislature to be passed, \nwhereby they may be restored to the enjoyments of that which is the \nnatural right of all men; and their children, who were born in this \nland of liberty, not be held as slaves. The petitions were denied.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson himself, in the initial draft of the Declaration of \nIndependence, had included wording that attacked Britains king and \nthe slave trade: He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, \nviolating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons \nof a distant people who never offended him, captivating and carrying \nthem into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death \nin their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the \nopprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian king of \nGreat Britain. Determined to keep open a market where men should be \nbought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing \nevery legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable \ncommerce. The passage caused intense debate and was deleted. In \nretrospect Jefferson blamed the deletion on delegates who represented \nmerchants with direct interests in the Atlantic slave trade.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in his political career Jefferson spoke out against slavery; he \neven introduced a Virginia law prohibiting the importation of African \nslaves. After a time his public voice on the matter faded.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson wrote that the institution of slavery was like holding a \nwolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrilliant and visionary, Jefferson remains as the great paradox of \nthe Founders, constantly convicted on the issue of slavery. Even as \nhe wrote the words We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all \nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness Jefferson possessed slaves. He went on to \nown 600 slaves during his lifetime, at any one time approximately 100 \nslaves lived at his Monticello estate . . . skilled craftsmen, \nartisans, domestic personal, and field workers.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington was also a slave owner. Reflecting on the \nincongruence of slavery with the ideals of liberty for which he had \nrisked his life, over time his convictions changed. By 1799 he had \nspecified in his will that the 123 slaves that he personally owned at \nMount Vernon would be freed at his wifes death. He also stipulated \nthat older slaves unable to work would be supported by the funds of \nhis estate.\u0014\nJohn Adams clearly spoke out against slavery, and Benjamin Franklin \nwas later to become one of the countrys leading abolitionists. \nNonetheless, it is a sobering fact to realize that 41 of the 56 \nsigners\u0014\n\u0014\nof the Declaration of Independence were slave owners. This ongoing \ncontradiction in the founding of the new nation would continue to \ngrind away at the very soul of liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the emerging American nation began its epic journey of liberty, \nthe brutal Atlantic slave trade still wreaked havoc on the coasts of \nAfrica, and the oppressive slave ships continued their grisly voyages \nof captive human cargo. Behind the scenes the details of this inhuman \nsubjugation of fellow humans are even more numbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the mid-1400s to the late 1800s, most European powers, notably \nBritain and Portugal, engaged in the trading of African slaves. It \nhas been estimated that up to 15 million Africans were forcibly \nkidnapped, violently put in chains, and shipped to the Western \nHemisphere during that span. Countless more died during the slave \nraiding and wars in Africa or in unbelievable conditions of \nconfinement aboard the horrific\u0014\n\u0014\nMiddle Passage voyages from Africa to the Americas. In profane \nalliances rogue African kings, the warlike Ashanti, and corrupt \nmerchants/tribesmen raided other African societies and villages. They \nthen sold captives and war prisoners to the European slave traders \npositioned along the coasts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is staggering to comprehend the inhumanity of the Atlantic slave \ntrade, but when human beings are reduced to property and morals bow \nto the lure of money, it is beyond nightmarish what can result.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most notorious episode of the Atlantic slave trade involved the \ninfamous slave ship Zong. During a 1781 voyage to Jamaica, with more \nthan 400 slaves aboard as cargo, water ran out as disease spread \namong the slaves. The ships captain, Luke Collingwood, knowing that \ninsurance would not cover the sick or fatalities caused by disease \namong his human cargo, but would cover drownings, decided to throw \noverboard those he deemed too ill to recover. To cut the slave \nowners losses and to claim the insurance, Collingwood callously \nordered the drowning murders of 133 slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disturbing diagram of the Brookes slave ship, first published in \nBritain during 1788 and widely distributed by anti-slavery groups, \nremains immoral and appalling in its graphic detail of 450 captive \nhuman beings chained and jammed into the cargo holds, virtually \nunable to move.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the worlds most dominant power and master of the seas, Britain \nsurged to the forefront of the Atlantic slave trade. British growers \nestablished large sugarcane plantations in the Caribbean islands, \nsuch as Barbados and Jamaica, where plantation owners grew wealthy on \nthe backs of African slave labor. Simply put, the history of Atlantic \ncommerce is inseparable from slavery, whether in the Caribbean, \nBrazil, or the Americas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith perverse justifications, economic profit, and distortions of \nreligion, slavery blended into everyday life. Few citizens stopped to \nthink that the basis of entire economies, their agricultural \nproducts, luxuries, and clothing, relied on slave labor. Meanwhile, \ngenerations of African men, women, and children were subjugated to \nlives of forced labor and cruelty. Of the estimated 12 million \nAfrican slaves transported across the Atlantic, during the \n1600s-1800s era, 2 million perished before reaching the shores of the \nAtlantic coast.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf evil and injustice are ever to be defeated, someone must speak up. \nDuring May of 1787 a dozen devout men met at a London printshop to \nform the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, \namong them several Quakers and Anglicans. Longtime abolitionist \nGranville Sharp and young Thomas Clarkson, whose tireless \naccumulation of evidence would prove vital to the cause, were \npresent. Abolishing the slave trade consumed Clarksons life. He \ntraveled more than 35,000 miles around England in search of \nwitnesses, observing the cruelty of the trade, interviewing, writing \nnotes, and investigating the countrys slave ports, such as \nLiverpool, where he narrowly escaped death at the hands of a gang of \nsailors who had been hired to kill him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/Steal Away\u0014\nFRS: This is an unusually great article.\u0014",

    "words": "James Cone and the liberating spirit of blackness\u0014\n                     In his final memoir, Cones testimony resounds. \u0014\n                       by Henry L. Carrigan Jr. October 18, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there was ever a time we needed James Cone with his powerful \nprophetic voice to call down thunder, that time is now. Like a blues \nmusician, Cone inhabits the souls of those whose voices cry out to be \nheard, and like the soul preacher and spirituals singer he is, he \ntestifies to the liberating spirit of love that grows out of \nembracing blackness. In Said I Wasnt Gonna Tell Nobody, Cone \npreaches more fiercely than in any other of his previous books, \ndeclaring: The blood of black people is crying out to God and to \nwhite people from the ground in the United States of America.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Cones physical voice is now silenthe died earlier this \nyearhis written voice cries out in this memoir, compelling us to \nlisten as he testifies. His testimony includes some already \nwell-known details about his life (which he described in his 1982 \nmemoir My Soul Looks Back) and analysis of how they shaped him. But \nthis new memoir also contains much more: his experiences writing his \nbooks, the challenges he faced from critics, the passion that urged \nhis words onto paper, and the new theological language in which he \nwas writingthe language of the black sermon and song, and in the \nspirit of the great preachers and singers I had heard all over \nArkansas and in Chicago and Detroit.\u0014\nHenry L. Carrigan Jr. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his early engagement with Karl Barths theology to the four \nbooks on black liberation theology he published between 1969 and \n1975, Cone demonstrated that his authority for doing theology comes \nfrom black experience and not from claims to divine revelation. \nLooking back on those years, he explains, I did not want to write \nanything that black people would not understand and read and hear as \ntheir own experience. If I couldnt preach it, I wouldnt write it. \nEngaging with the Black Power movement saved my life as a \ntheologian, he writes, because the stakes were so much higher than \nin European theological debates: It didnt matter whether Barth or \nHarnack was right in their debate about the meaning of revelation. I \nwasnt ready to risk my life for that. Now with Black Power, \neverything was at stakethe affirmation of black humanity in a white \nsupremacist world. I was ready to die for black dignity.\u0014\n\u0014\nCone structures this memoir with the words of the gospel song I Said \nI Wasnt Gonna Tell Nobody. Using individual lines from the hymn as \nchapter titlessuch as you ought to been there for a chapter on his \nwriting of A Black Theology of Liberationhe moves from exclaiming \nthat he couldnt keep his blackness to himself in the first chapter \nto singin and shoutin as he tells about what he learned from \nJames Baldwin in the final chapter. The writing dances across the \npage, echoing the music of Cones soul. Every page resounds with \nstriking chords and notes that fill readers with urgency.\u0014\nHe captures his own experience of writing playfully and soulfully:\u0014\n\u0014\nI was writing out of experience, speaking for the dignity of black \npeople in a white supremacist world. I was on a mission to transform \nself-loathing Negro Christians into black-loving revolutionary \ndisciples of Jesus Christ. I was singing a new theological song, a \nblues song, messing with theology the way B. B. King messed with \nmusic. I used Barths theology the way B. B. used his guitar and Ray \nCharles used the piano.\u0014\n\u0014\nCone explains why black theology is uniquely improvisational: Black \nliberation theology came out of black culture and religion, and it \ncelebrated a new freedom to talk about God and Jesus in a jazz mode, \na blues style, and with the sound of the spirituals. That was where \nits mojo came fromits magic. But the spiritedness of Cones \nlanguage doesnt diminish the seriousness of his message. I wanted \nto wake up black people and let them know that the day of the white \nChrist was over. A new Black Messiah was in town.\u0014\n\u0014\nCone proclaims the centrality of the black Christ to his theology. \nFrom his earliest work, he says, I was deeply Christological in my \norientation. But his focus on Jesus didnt derive from the sources \nhis professors and theological mentors had relied on. He explains,\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack theologys spirit did not come from Europe but from Africa, \nfrom American slavery and its auction blocks, from the spirituals and \nthe blues. The Christocentric power of black theology was defined by \nthe Black Christ who enabled black people to survive slavery, to \novercome Jim Crow segregation, and to defeat the lynching tree. The \nBlack Christ was a black slave and a black body swinging in the \nsouthern breeze.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Cone roots his theology in black experience, he also \nproclaims that Christa dark-skinned Hebrew who died fighting for \nthe freedom for his peopledissolves any purported dichotomy between \nblack experience and revelation. God in Christ did not make an \nabsolute distinction between divine revelation and the black \nexperience but rather took that experience as Gods own reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nReflecting on how these ideas shaped The Cross and the Lynching Tree, \nCone explains whats at stake:\u0014\n\u0014\nLynched black bodies are symbols of Christs body. If we want to \nunderstand what the crucifixion means for Americans today, we must \nview it through the lens of mutilated black bodies whose lives are \ndestroyed in the criminal justice system. Jesus continues to be \nlynched before our eyes. He is crucified wherever people are \ntormented. That is why I say Christ is black.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaid I Wasnt Gonna Tell Nobody testifies to a message that we sorely \nneed. If we fail to listen to Cone and allow his words to live in our \nhearts and our actions, we fall short of our Christian vocation to \nlove our neighbors and to liberate the captives, the marginalized, \nand the oppressed.\u0014",

This harrowing and vivid \naccount proved to be the most compelling evidence against Jeffs, \nshowing the harsh realities of this closed community and the lengths \nto which Jeffs went in order to control the sect's women. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, in this courageous memoir, Elissa Wall tells the incredible and \ninspirational story of how she emerged from the confines of the \nFundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) and helped bring \none of America's most notorious criminals to justice. Offering a \nchild's perspective on life in the FLDS, Wall discusses her \ntumultuous youth, explaining how her family's turbulent past \nintersected with her strong will and identified her as a girl who \nneeded to be controlled through marriage. Detailing how Warren \nJeffs's influence over the church twisted its already rigid beliefs \nin dangerous new directions, Wall portrays the inescapable mind-set \nand unrelenting pressure that forced her to wed despite her repeated \nprotests that she was too young.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce she was married, Wall's childhood shattered as she was obligated \nto follow Jeffs's directives and submit to her husband in \"mind, \nbody, and soul.\" With little money and no knowledge of the outside \nworld, she was trapped and forced to endure the pain and abuse of her \nloveless relationship, which eventually pushed her to spend nights \nsleeping in her truck rather than face the tormentor in her bed.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet even in those bleak times, she retained a sliver of hope that one \nday she would find a way out, and one snowy night that came in the \nform of a rugged stranger named Lamont Barlow. Their chance encounter \nset in motion a friendship and eventual romance that gave her the \nstrength she needed to break free from her past and sever the chains \nof the church.\u0014\nBut though she was out of the FLDS, Wall would still have to face \nJeffsthis time in court. In Stolen Innocence, she delves into the \ndifficult months on the outside that led her to come forward against \nhim, working with prosecutors on one of the biggest criminal cases in \nUtah's history, so that other girls still inside the church might be \nspared her cruel fate.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than a tale of survival and freedom, Stolen Innocence is the \nstory of one heroic woman who stood up for what was right and \nreclaimed her life.\u0014",

    "title": "SOCIAL SCIENCE INSPIRED VIEW OF THE BIBLE",
    "words": "Social science inspired view of the bible\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jesus Before the Gospels\" may not be Bart Ehrman's best book so far, \nbut it is certainly his most original. In his earlier works, he \nexplained contradictions between - and within - 27 books of the New \nTestament by careful analysis of the textual sources from antiquity. \nIn \"Jesus Before the Gospels\" Ehrman steps outside the 200 year old \nacademic discipline of source criticism in which he perfected, and \ninterpret Christianity's based on insights and research from \npsychology, ethnology, social anthropology and cultural history.\u0014\n\u0014\nEhrman explains why the gospels are far from modern biographies which \nshould not be taken as face value:\u0014\n\"the disciples of Jesus did not actually write the Gospels. The \ndisciples were lower-class, illiterate peasants who spoke Aramaic, \nJesuss own language. The Gospels, on the other hand, were written by \nhighly educated Greek-speaking Christians forty to sixty-five years \nlater. The stories had been in circulation for decades, not simply \namong disciples who allegedly memorized Jesuss words and deeds, but \nalso among all sorts of people, most of whom had never laid eyes on \nan eyewitness or even on anyone else who had. And so, just as there \nis no evidence that Jesuss followers memorized his teachings, the \nidea that everyone throughout Christendom telling stories about Jesus \nhad memorized them is beyond belief\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut how can our modern knowledge on how stories change when they are \nretold for decades?\u0014\n\"We know in fact that they were changed, because we can compare \ndifferent accounts of the same words or activities of Jesus and find \ndiscrepancies. Yet other accounts are historically implausible, and \nso appear to have been created in the years of transmission as people \nrecounted what they had heard about the life of their Savior.\" Ehrman \ncites many interesting interdisciplinary examples as well as classic \nstudies from a broad range of fields in support for his view. Ehrman \nalso tries to explain how social groups remember, as opposed to how \nindividuals remember stories:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"From that point on, as more members of a group recount this \ndistorted memory, the other members of the groupeven if they either \ndistinctly think that the memory is wrong or dont remember it  feel \nconsiderable social pressure to agree with everyone else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe early Christians \"... told stories that remembered Jesuss past \nin light of the communitys present. These may have been distorted \nmemories in the sense thatfor the form criticsthey involved words \nand deeds that did not actually go back to the historical Jesus. But \nthey were valuable memories nonetheless, and no less real to the \npeople who held and shared them than recollections that actually were \nrooted in the life of the historical Jesus\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen writing about a subject like New Testamant history, repetitions \nare unavoidable. If you have read Ehrman's earlier works, you will \nrecognize more than half of the repeated from earlier works. (This is \nthe reason I give it 4 not 5 stars). There may be decades between \neach time new and important written source may be discovered. Finding \nsupport from social science for writing about history gives new \nperspectives. Other fields of history has gained significantly from \nmethods from social history, ever since historians of the \n\"annales-school\" started this movement of memory history more than \nfifty years ago.\u0014",

    "title": "STEPS IN IMPEACHMENT",
    "words": "What are the steps in an impeachment?\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Dec. 19, 1998, President Clinton was impeached by the House of \nRepresentatives. However, impeachment is only the first stage in the \ntwo-pronged process to remove a president or another federal official \nfrom office.After the House votes to impeach, the Senate must then \nhold a trial to determine whether an official is guilty and should \nactually be removed from office. To start the impeachment process, an \nindividual member of the House must request that impeachment \nproceedings begin, or the House itself could pass a resolution to \nlaunch the proceedings. The Speaker of the House would then refer the \nprocess to the House Judiciary Committee, which must then determine \nif there is enough grounds for the process to move forward. If the \ncommittee finds enough evidence, it would then draft articles of \nimpeachment and vote on whether to bring the articles to the House \nfloor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case for impeachment would then go before the rest of the House. \nIf a simple majority votes to pass the articles of impeachment, the \nPresident or other official is impeached.\u0014\nAfter that, a two-thirds majority of the Senate must decide whether \nan official is guilty or not guilty of the charges in the articles of \nimpeachment. For most officials, the President pro tempore of the \nSenate would oversee the process  but if the president were the \nofficial being tried, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would \npreside. If a two-thirds majority votes to convict, the official \nwould be removed from public office. Afterward, the Senate could also \nvote to disqualify them from holding a federal office in the future \nand take away the officials pension or other benefits. The convicted \nofficial could even face criminal or civil charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy dont impeachments happen more often?\u0014\n\u0014\nImpeachments require a significant amount of political will, Gerhardt \nsays. An impeachment will take up a lot of a Congresss time and \nenergy, and congress members who support impeachment have a lot to \nlose and potentially little to gain by undertaking an impeachment.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn practice, in order to actually remove a President from office, \nmembers of his or her own party must decide that there is enough \npublic desire to impeach him or her, as Elaine Kamarck of the \nBrookings Institute has explained. In order for an impeachment to \nmove forward, a presidents own party has to get on board with an \nimpeachment vote. For that to happen, it would mean that the \npresidents supporters in the electorate have lost faith in him, she \nwrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Clintons case, Senate Democrats ultimately decided not to \nconvict, but it wasnt always clear that they wouldnt turn on him, \nGerhardt says. A lot of these people found that there was \nmisconduct, he says, but there wasnt enough to impeach him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy was Clinton impeached?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe House voted to pass articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, 1998, on \ntwo charges: perjury and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors alleged \nthat Clinton had perjured himself by testifying to investigators that \nhe had not had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and that he \nhad attempted to encourage White House staff to give false testimony \nby denying the relationship.\u0014\nGerhardt said that, while popular support for impeachment waned as \nthe proceedings went on, a significant undercurrent of public anger \ndrove the proceedings forward.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou dont get an impeachment without a good deal of hate, he says. \nThere were a lot of people who hated Bill Clinton.\u0014\nWhy wasnt Clinton convicted and removed from office?\u0014\nUltimately, there was uncertainty as to whether or not Clintons \nwrongdoing had been serious enough to justify removing him from \noffice  as well as insufficient public support for doing so.\u0014\nBill Clintons approval ratings remained high throughout his second \nterm of office, including during the trial. The impeachment seemed to \ngalvanize the country to support him. His peak job-approval rating  \n73%  was recorded the very week of the impeachment, according to \nGallup. When Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr were named \nPerson of the Year in 1998, TIME columnist Michael Kinsley wrote that \nthe lack of public interest in Clintons alleged misconduct was \nstriking:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most significant political story of the year is that most \ncitizens dont seem to think its significant that the President had \noral sex with a 22-year-old intern. Yes, yes, and he lied about it. \nUnder oath. Blah blah blah. They still dont care. Rarely has such an \nunexpected popular consensus been so clear. And rarely has such a \nclear consensus been so unexpected.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many Senators thought that Clintons behavior was wrong, many \ndid not agree that it was worthy of a conviction.\u0014\nIn voting to acquit the President, I do so with grave misgivings for \nI do not mean in any way to exonerate this man, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine said in announcing her decision.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happened to Bill Clinton after the impeachment?\u0014\nAlthough Clinton was never convicted, he arguably did not get away \nunscathed from the proceedings.\u0014\n\u0014\nClintons law licenses with the U.S. Supreme Court and the Arkansas \nbar were suspended, which prohibited him from practicing law after \nhis time in office. After he was suspended from the Supreme Court Bar \nin 2001, he chose to resign his license rather than be permanently \ndisbarred. Possibly the biggest consequence of Clintons impeachment, \nhowever, was the mark it left on his public record.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Jan. 17, 2001, Gary Langer ABC News characterized how most \nAmericans felt about Bill Clinton at the time: You cant trust him, \nhes got weak morals and ethics  and hes done a heck of a good \njob, Langer wrote.\u0014",

We stand on the shoulders \nof the saints who have gone before, exemplifying how to live and love \nGod faithfully.\u0014\n\u0014\nAthanasius (296373)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Athanasiuss lifelong battle for the deity of Christ against the \nArians, who said that Christ was created, Athanasius said, \nConsidering that this struggle is for our all . . . let us also make \nit our earnest care and aim to guard what we have received. When all \nis at stake, it is worth contending. This is what love does.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine (354430)\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustines song of grace is unlike anything you will read in almost \nany modern book about grace. The omnipotent power of grace, for \nAugustine, is the power of sovereign joy. This alone delivered him \nfrom a lifetime of bondage to sexual appetite and philosophical \npride. Discovering that beneath the vaunted powers of human will is a \ncauldron of desire holding us captive to irrational choices opens the \nway to see grace as the triumph of sovereign joy. Oh, how we need \nthe ancient biblical insight of Augustine to free us from the \npleasant slavery that foils the fulfillment of the Great Commandment \nand the finishing of the Great Commission.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther (14831546)\u0014\n\u0014\nJustification by faith alone, apart from works of the law, was the \ntriumph of grace in the life of Martin Luther. He did, you might say, \nstand on his head for joy, and with him all the world was turned \nupside-down.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Tyndale (14941536)\u0014\n\u0014\nMan is lost, spiritually dead, condemned. God is sovereign; Christ \nis sufficient. Faith is all.

How are we to know that the Bible is \nthe Word of God? Do we lean on the testimony of manthe authority of \nthe church, as in Roman Catholicism? Or are we more immediately \ndependent on the majesty of Gods grace?\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Herbert (15931633)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe central theme of his poetry was the redeeming love of Christ, \nand he labored with all his literary might to see it clearly, feel it \ndeeply, and show it strikingly.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Owen (16161683)\u0014\n\u0014\nOwens personal holiness and public fruitfulness did not just happen \nto him. He pursued them. There were strategies of personal discipline \nand public authenticity that God used to make him what he was. In all \nour life and ministry, as we care for people and contend for the \nfaith, we can learn much from Owens pursuit of holiness in private \nand public.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bunyan (16281688)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was even more explicit that there is divine purpose and design in \nsuffering for the good of Gods children and for the glory of his \nname. The great Pilgrims Progress, as George Whitefield said, \nsmells of the prison. It was born in suffering, and it portrays the \nChristian life as a life of affliction. But Bunyan saw his \nimprisonment as no more than what God had designed for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Whitfield (17141770)\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one level, Whitefields power was the natural power of eloquence, \nand at another it was the spiritual power of God to convert sinners \nand transform communities. There is no reason to doubt that he was \nthe instrument of God in the salvation of thousands.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brainerd (17181747)\u0014\n\u0014\nBrainerds smoldering misery of isolation and disease exploded in \nglobal missions beyond all imagination. Irony and disproportion are \nall Gods way. He keeps us off balance with his unpredictable \nconnections. We think we know how to do something big, and God makes \nit small. We think that all we have is weak and small, and God makes \nit big.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Newton (17251807)\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Newton, his life was the clearest testimony to the \nheart-breaking mercy of God he ever saw. Even at the end of his life \nhe was still marveling that he was saved and called to preach the \ngospel of grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Cowper (17311800)\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the completeness of [Christs] justification that the Holy \nSpirit used to awaken and rescue Cowper from the darkness of \ndamnation that had settled over him. The war for Cowpers soul was \nnot ended, but the decisive battle had been fought and won by the \ngospel of justification by grace through faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Wilberforce (17591833)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made Wilberforce tick was a profound biblical allegiance to \nwhat he called the peculiar doctrines of Christianity. These, he \nsaid, give rise in turn to true affections for spiritual things, \nwhich then break the power of pride and greed and fear and lead to \ntransformed morals, which lead to the political welfare of the \nnation. No true Christian can endure in battling unrighteousness \nunless his heart is aflame with new spiritual affections, or \npassions.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Simeon (17591836)\u0014\n\u0014\nMay Simeons life and ministry help us see persecution, opposition, \nslander, misunderstanding, disappointment, self-recrimination, \nweakness, and danger as the normal portion of faithful Christian \nliving and ministry. I want us to see a beleaguered triumph in the \nlife of a man who was a sinner like us and who, year after year in \nhis trials, grew downward in humility and upward in his adoration \nof Christ and who did not yield to bitterness or to the temptation to \nleave his chargefor fifty-four years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdoniram Judson (17881850)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat sustained this man and his three wives was a rock-solid \nconfidence that God is sovereign and God is good. And all things come \nfrom his hand for the goodsometimes the incredibly painful goodof \nhis children.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Meller (18051898)\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was the chief passion and unifying aim of Mllers ministry: to \nlive a life and lead a ministry in a way that proves God is real, God \nis trustworthy, and God answers prayer. He built orphanages the way \nhe did to help Christians trust God.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn G. Paton (18301911)\u0014\n\u0014\nHis courage, when he was surrounded by armed natives, came through a \nkind of praying that claimed the promises under the overarching \nsubmission to Gods wisdom as to what would work most for Gods glory \nand his good.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor (18321905)\u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor experienced such a powerful revelation of the inexpressible \nreality of union with Christ, as an absolute and glorious fact of \nsecurity and sweetness and power, that it carried in it its own \neffectiveness.

    "words": "Shishak King Of Egypt\u0014\nShishak in the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was only after the tenth century that the name of the Pharaoh was \nincluded in the way Egyptian kings were called. With the new \ncustomary practice, the Bible followed suit as well. Shishak is known \nto be the first Egyptian king that was given a personal name in the \nBible. His rule coincided with King Solomon and also of his son, \nRehoboam, which is where he is found on the Bible Timeline. He is \nmost known for his crusade all throughout Israel and Judah as stated \nin the Hebrew Bible. He was also the Egyptian king who granted \nJeroboam refuge from Solomons wrath.\u0014\n\u0014\nShishaks Role\u0014\n\u0014\nShishak is mentioned in the book of 1 Kings about Solomons idolatry. \nBecause of Solomons sins, God made it known through a prophet named \nAhijah His plans to take away ten tribes from Solomon. The prophet \nalso foretold that the ten tribes were then to be given to one of \nSolomons court officials named Jeroboam. Angered by this prophecy, \nSolomon plotted to kill Jeroboam. It is this time that Jeroboam left \nSolomons court and sought refuge in Egypt. Shishak allowed Jeroboam \nto stay in Egypt while Solomon was still king.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Solomon died, Jeroboam went back to his home. With the kingdom \ndivided into two, Jeroboam became king and ruled over the tribes in \nthe northern part while Rehoboam became the leader of the Southern \ntribes. This was seen by Shishak as an opportune time to launch a \ncampaign to capture the weakened and divided kingdoms. During the \nfifth year that Rehoboam was king, Shishak came with his great army \nof Egyptian troops and took over much of Israel. This event is dated \nto 926 and 917 BC. He was believed to have the support of the \nSukkites, Kushites and the Libyans from Egypt. With thousands of \nchariots and horsemen, he was able to seize the cities of Judah and \neven reached Jerusalem. As stated in the Bible, Shishak was said to \nhave taken away many of the treasures of the holy temple and those \nfrom the royal palace including the gold shields made by Solomon. \nThis was in exchange for sparing Jerusalem from his attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lords plan\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Rehoboam had inherited his Kingdom, he stayed in Jerusalem and \nfortified towns for defense all around Judea. When he gained control \nover the Kingdom, he, along with everyone else in Judah no longer \nobeyed the Lord. As punishment, the Lord allowed Shishak to enter and \nattack the Kingdom. He was able to capture all the cities in Judah \nand was soon heading to Jerusalem. Rehoboam and the other leaders of \nthe city were told by the prophet, Shemaiah that because of their \ndisobedience, the Lord has also abandoned them. They then felt that \nindeed the Lord was right, and they all became repentant for their \nsins. As the leaders of Judah returned to the Lord, Jerusalem was \nspared from Shishaks attacks. Nonetheless, the Lord was still \nangered by their sins that he allowed Shishak to rule over the \npeople. For them to feel how it is to serve a foreign king and not \ntheir God (2 Chronicles). However, as Rehoboam returned to the Lord, \nJudah was not completely destroyed and eventually became prosperous \nonce more.\u0014\n\u0014\nBible References:\u0014\n\t1 Kings 11:40- Shishak was first introduced in the bible when he \ngranted Jeroboam refuge in Israel\u0014\n\t1 Kings 14:25-26- Shishak attacks Rehoboams kingdom in Judea and \ntaking away treasures\u0014\n\t2 Chronicles 12:3-4- Shishaks attack in Jerusalem as the Lords \npunishment\u0014",

    "title": "SOCIAL GOSPEL'S MOST COMPELLING ADVOCATE--RAUSCHENBUSCH",
    "words": "Walter Rauschenbusch: Social Gospels Most Compelling Advocate\u0014\nBy Bill Pitts | February 19, 2019 |  Print \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter Rauschenbusch was consumed with a passion for social justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrained in Rochester seminary as a Baptist minister, he accepted a \ncall in 1886 by the Second German Baptist Church in New York City, \nwhere he served for 11 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was fluent in German as well as English and finished at the top of \nhis class in both university and seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as he began his ministry among immigrants, he was distraught to \nlearn that he had not been prepared to address the most urgent daily \nneeds of his congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York City was filled with poor people whose only asset was their \nlabor. Rauschenbusch wanted to help them with their pressing physical \nas well as spiritual needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe reported that the person who first gave him guidance in \nunderstanding the social and economic structure of the United States \nwas Henry George, whose Progress and Poverty (1879) identified a \ntroubling paradox: How could so much wealth be created and yet so \nmany people be left in poverty?\u0014\n\u0014\nHis proposed remedy assumed the criteria of justice for all: The \nnation must look out for the welfare of all members of society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis proposal fired Rauschenbuschs imagination; he became a social \nactivist for ways to improve New York City as well as a minister who \npreached the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauschenbusch did not view the gospel and social justice as two \nseparate ways of life. Instead, his genius was that he incorporated \nthe goal of social justice into Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn seminary, he learned that recent scholarship was convinced that \nJesus central message focused on the Kingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauschenbusch pondered the meaning of this concept. A kingdom is more \nthan an individual. The model prayer does not declare My Father, \nbut rather Our Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his earliest sermons, Rauschenbusch proclaimed the gospel in terms \nof personal conversion experience, the familiar tradition of American \nrevivalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, in a sermon 18 months after his arrival in New York City, he \nproposed a larger two-fold understanding of the Kingdom of God: The \nindividual is sinful and needs redemption; likewise, the structures \nof society promote injustices and are destructive to individuals; \ntherefore, society also needs salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe social gospel is the name given to this interpretation of \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashington Gladden, Richard Ely and others had already articulated \nthe concept of a social gospel. Rauschenbusch, however, would become \nits most compelling advocate.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial salvation was not an optional addition to personal salvation; \nit was inherent in the gospel of Jesus. The churchs task is to \naddress the need for salvation of society as well as the individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenceforth, Rauschenbuschs sermons and articles repeatedly addressed \nsocial issues.\u0014\nIn Beneath the Glitter, he pointed out that the vast wealth of the \n1 percent was created from the deep suffering of the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another sermon, he condemned the ostentatious luxury and waste of \npeople listed in the Social Register, the citys 400 most prominent \ncitizens.\u0014\n\u0014\nA parishioner sent a blistering letter saying that Rauschenbusch was \nwrong to meddle in the lives of the wealthy. But he persisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1897, Rauschenbusch was called to Rochester Seminary to teach. Ten \nyears later, he published Christianity and the Social Crisis, where \nhe argued that the prophets denounced injustice in Israels society \nand called on the people to be fair in their treatment of each other. \nThis, they said, is what God requires.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauschenbusch observed that this dimension of the biblical message \nhad been obscured throughout most of church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Industrial Revolution had exposed vast inequities and injustices. \nRauschenbusch identified injustices perpetrated toward Native \nAmericans, African-Americans and women.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the burning issue for him was the poverty of workers, which \nwas caused by greed. The church must not abandon the workers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book resonated with many ministers, and the book made him \nfamous. The permanence of Rauschenbuschs influence was assured when \nthe newly formed Federal Council of Churches adopted a social creed \nin 1908, clearly supporting Rauschenbuschs goals for church and \nsociety.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his 1912 publication, Christianizing the Social Order, \nRauschenbusch devoted a chapter to Justice where he writes, The \nsimplest and most fundamental question needed in the moral relations \nof men is justice. We can gauge the ethical importance of justice by \nthe sense of outrage with which we instinctively react against \ninjustice. He calls justice the foundation of the social order.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauschenbusch articulates the problem of injustice in terms of social \nclass and economic inequity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe explains that theoretically we have no special privileges in \nAmerica. Our country was dedicated to the proposition that all men \nare created free and equal. But in reality, America has created a \nclass of privilege based not on titles (as in Europe) but on wealth  \nlarger fortunes generated in a single generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew ministers were willing to criticize the American capitalist \nsystem as a major source of suffering and misery.\u0014\nThe wealthy paid meager wages, creating an unjust system of \ndistribution of wealth. This is why Rauschenbusch supported a minimum \nwage, a 40-hour week and safer working conditions as well as city \nownership of utilities and transportation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Rauschenbuschs view, distributive justice was the major criteria \nfor measuring the Christianizing of society.\u0014\nRauschenbusch thought America had made great economic strides forward \nbut was still far behind in its moral responsibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nStructures of economic injustice persist in America today. The \nimbalance of the economy is constantly in the news: poverty, debt, \nproposals for minimum wage, living wage and universal wage, health \ncosts, the 1 percent and the rest of the population, failure to \ncontrol payday lending and much more.\u0014\n\u0014\nRauschenbusch would sadly affirm that we are still a very \nun-Christian and unjust nation in our economic structures but would \ncounsel us to work for the humane ideal of justice.\u0014",

In the cell phone videos captured by the students, \nDemsey invites the teens to spit in his face, promising no \nrepercussions. According to the Washington Post, the footage records \na student saying, Can I do it again? as he returns to the back of \nthe line, while another student declares, Thats enough. \u0014\nThe exercise continues with Demsey upping the ante.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf theres anyone here that would like to slap me, you can do so \nwithout any repercussions, he said.\u0014\nAlthough some students backed away in apparent disbelief, several \nstudents took advantage of the offer, with one student slapping him \nsharply with an open hand.

    "words": "\u0014\nSamson Occom, American Indian, Ordained\u0014\n\u0014\n There was a great stir of religion in these parts of the world both \namongst the Indians as well as the English, and about this time I \nbegan to think about the Christian religion, and was under great \ntrouble of mind for some time.\" That is how Samson Occom, direct \ndescendant of the great Mohegan chief Uncas, described the effect of \nthe Great Awakening on himself when he was sixteen years old. As a \nconsequence, he put his faith in Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1743, when he was twenty, he went to study with Rev. Eleazar \nWheelock who ran a school. Since his conversion, Samson had shared \nthe gospel with other Indians. Now he hoped to learn to read so that \nhe could study the Bible for himself. In this, he was successful. \nDespite poor eyesight, he became one of the first American Indians to \npublish works in the English language. These included sermons, hymns \nand a short autobiography.\u0014\n\u0014\nWord of Samson's work among the Indians impressed American religious \nleaders. Wheelock himself recognized that if more Indians could be \ntrained like Occom, they could carry the gospel to their own people. \nHe threw open his school to Indians.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Presbyterian leaders in Long Island took notice of \nSamson's work. He had not been able to go to college and get his \ntheological training because of his poor eyesight; nonetheless, they \nordained him on this day, August 30, 1759, to go as a missionary \namong his own people. To its shame, the church never paid Samson what \nit paid its white preachers. But despite his deep poverty and \ncontinual bad health, he worked tirelessly to convert Indians and to \npass on to them the things he had learned in school.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Wheelock found that few Indians attended his school. He realized \nthis was because it was far from centers frequented by the Native \nAmericans. Looking about for a new location, he settled on the \nConnecticut Valley of New Hampshire. An Indian trail led across this \narea. He solicited funds to build an Indian school there, but among \nsettlers who had had their fill of Indian wars, the scheme met a cool \nreception. Wheelock realized he'd have to raise the money overseas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is how it came about that Samson Occom sailed to England in \n1765. Preaching from church to church with his traveling companion \nRev. Daniel Whitaker, he was a sensation, drawing large crowds. He \nraised the enormous sum of twelve thousand pounds. The money was \nbanked and its interest drawn to build the new school. Unfortunately, \nRev. Wheelock did not abide by his original intent. Instead of using \nthe money primarily for Indian education, he diverted it to the \neducation of \"English\" youth. All the same, it is largely owing to \nSamson Occom that the institution we know as Dartmouth University was \ncreated.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamson felt betrayed. He realized he had been used. It seemed to him \nthat Wheelock saw him not as a brother equal in Christ, but as an \nexhibit or a performing monkey. In spite of his pain, or because of \nit, he clung even more tightly to Christ. To the end of his life, he \npreached among the Indian tribes and also pleaded for their rights \nand privileges.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis wife found him dead on July 14, 1792. He had just completed \nwriting an article and collapsed while walking back to the house. \nHundreds of Indians attended his funeral.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBowden, Henry Warner.

    "title": "SUICIDES OF TWO MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES IN ONE WEEK",
    "words": "Suicides of two mental health advocates in a week serve as a grim \nreminder\u0014\nThis week, the deaths of pastor Jarrid Wilson and Gregory Eells, head \nof mental health services at UPenn, highlighted an alarming reality \nfor those in mental health.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Chuck, NBC News\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nobody is immune from suicide,\" including mental health \nprofessionals, said Freedenthal, who is now an associate professor at \nthe University of Denver graduate school of social work and the \ncreator of SpeakingofSuicide.com, a suicide prevention website.\u0014\n\"The message can be good and true and inspirational, but that doesn't \nmean the messenger is immune to the same challenges as everybody \nelse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis week, two suicides highlighted that grim reality: The suicides \nof Gregory Eells, the head of counseling and psychological services \nat the University of Pennsylvania, and Jarrid Wilson, a California \nmegachurch pastor who was an outspoken mental health advocate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two worked in different circles and did not appear to have any \nconnection to each other, but their deaths left many asking the same \nquestion: How could individuals who did so much for the mental health \ncommunity not have gotten the help they needed themselves?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The thing about depression and anxiety, and other mental illnesses \nor psychiatric conditions, is it typically involves our brains lying \nto ourselves,\" said Julie Cerel, a professor at the University of \nKentucky College of Social Work and a past president of the American \nAssociation of Suicidology.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When depression is telling you you're not worthy, even if we're \ntrained to combat those false beliefs in others, it's really hard to \nbe able to stop and do that for yourself  especially if you've been \ndoing that for other people all day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the United States, suicide is on the rise. Experts say multiple \nfactors lead to someone taking their own life and say suicide can \nhappen to anyone  even the famous and successful, like the \ncelebrities Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut many say a stigma still exists against seeking help for suicidal \nthoughts in a place where one would least expect it: in the mental \nhealth professional community itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There may be for some people the sense of, 'I'm a counselor, I know \nwhat to do, I help other people all day long, I know how to help \nmyself,'\" said Lynn Linde, chief knowledge and learning officer for \nthe American Counseling Association, a not-for-profit dedicated to \nthe counseling profession. \"Counselors are so busy giving to others \nthat they don't always take care of themselves. They may minimize \ntheir own issues.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere can be fear of professional repercussions too, Freedenthal \nsaid. Mental health professionals may be seeing a therapist who knows \npeople in the same professional circles as they do, and \"even though \nthere's rules of confidentiality, there's still fear of that being \nviolated.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They also may feel that they're expected to be stronger,\" \nFreedenthal said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Eells and Wilson were not working as mental health counselors, \nit was not clear whether they had sought professional help in the \nweeks before their deaths or what led to their suicides.\u0014\n\u0014\nEells had been at the University of Pennsylvania for six months and \nhad found the job more difficult than he expected, his mother told \nThe Philadelphia Inquirer after his death. The job kept him hundreds \nof miles away from his wife and family, who were still living in \nIthaca, New York, where he had previously worked at Cornell \nUniversity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson, a pastor at Harvest Christian Fellowship Church who had \nfounded a Christian organization to help those with mental health and \nsubstance abuse, had been open about a longstanding battle with \ndepression. Shortly before his death, Wilson tweeted: Loving Jesus \ndoesnt always cure suicidal thoughts. Loving Jesus doesn't always \ncure depression. ... But that doesn't mean Jesus doesn't offer us \ncompanionship and comfort.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJared Pingleton, director of mental health care and ministry for the \nAmerican Association of Christian Counselors, said many pastors carry \nthe burdens of those in their churches and ignore their own need for \nself-care.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think many times, pastors feel guilty to take care of their own \nneeds,\" he said. \"It's an occupational hazard.

And woe to the rival who steps on his \nenemy's turf! In the twelfth century, the gang fight was between \nChristian Crusaders and Muslim Saracens. Chatillon, a cruel Crusader, \nmassacred several dozen Muslim pilgrims in cold blood just because \nthey stepped onto his turf. This so maddened Sultan Saladin of the \nSaracens that he vowed revenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin had become Sultan of Egypt in 1174 through a coup. After \nconquering Syria and Damascus, he led the Saracens in victory over \nthe Crusaders on the plain of Tiberias in 1187. With his own \nscimitar, he kept his promise and slew Chatillon. The rival gangs \nnext \"rumbled\" over Jerusalem. On this day, October 2, 1187, the \nMuslim general captured the holy city. Muslims immediately clambered \nup and removed the cross that the Crusaders had mounted on the cupola \nof the Dome of the Rock. According to an eyewitness, the combined \nroar of the Muslims shouting \"Allah is greatest!\" and the groans of \nthe defeated Crusaders, watching the fall of their sacred symbol, was \nso loud it shook the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                     Saladin's Reign of Jerusalem\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin shamed the ruthless Crusaders by treating the city with \nkindness and keeping every promise he made to its people. Islam \ncontrolled Jerusalem from that day until the 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin hoped to hold all of Palestine. However, Crusaders Richard \nLionheart and Philip Augustus of France soon recaptured Acre. Richard \nLionheart defeated the Saladin again, dashing Saracen hopes of total \ncontrol. The Lionheart perpetrated atrocities to equal the other \nCrusaders. Yet his personal strength and valor made him legendary. He \nis said to have struck down four hundred men by himself in one battle \nalone. Faced with such a foe, Saladin finally agreed to a treaty that \npermitted Europeans to hold ports on the Palestine coast. Christians \nwere allowed to make pilgrimages to sacred shrines in Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaladin's courage, justice and moderation were rare in that age and \nhave won him lasting respect in the West. Christians thought they \nwere justified in launching the crusades. They argued that their \nactions were defensive-- preemptive strikes to keep Islam from \nrenewing its attacks on Europe--and that they were just taking back \nturf the Saracens had snatched earlier. Whether their arguments are \nvalid or not, one thing is certain: They did not live up to Christ's \nteachings about love after they had conquered the Middle East.

    "title": "SOMETIMES RUNNING IS AS BRAVE AS FIGHTING",
    "words": "The True Story of Harriet Tubman Shows That Sometimes Running Is as \nBrave as Fighting\u0014\n\u0014\nFor African Americans, there is a long history of leaving family and \nfriends behind, going elsewhere in search of safety. At the turn of \nthe 20th century, decades before Wrights testimony, African \nAmericans fled from the violence of the South for opportunity in \nnorthern and western cities in a movement that became known as the \nGreat Migration. But perhaps the most symbolic example of African \nAmericans fleeing state-sanctioned violence features the Underground \nRailroad. A loosely connected system of safe havens, the Underground \nis given credit for shuttling tens of thousands of enslaved fugitives \nout of the South to non-slave holding states and Canada. Sitting at \nthe center of this history is abolitionist and womens rights \nactivist Harriet Tubman Davis.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a negative connotation linked to flight. To run away is \noften seen as a cowardly thing to do. Fight and flight are \nopposites and those who flee are often seen as taking the easy way \nout; those who stay for the battle are brave. But hundreds of years \nof African American history belie that simplistic notion. Running can \nbe just as brave as going to battleand, in fact, they can be the \nsame thing. If anyone knew the power behind fighting and flight, it \nwas Tubman.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the release this Friday of the biopic Harrietwritten, directed \nand produced by a heavy-hitting team of black women \nfilmmakersaudiences across the world will be introduced to an \nupdated and multi-dimensional exploration of the woman who rescued \nenslaved men, women and children from certain terror and suffering. \nFor almost a decade, Tubman put her own safety aside each time she \nferried fugitives to safety. She was an indomitable leader who had \nher God and her gun as her only weapons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat gun features prominently in advertisements for the movie. Across \nthe several varieties of posters and trailers, there are a few common \nthreads: theres Cynthia Erivo as Tubman, theres her unyielding \nstare and theres her gun. Tubmans own narrativewritten by Sarah \nBradford, based on interviews, and published in 1869explained the \nobvious need to carry a pistol. Not only was she in danger of being \ncaptured or murdered during her time as a conductor on the \nUnderground Railroad, but she also needed her weapon to convince \nweary and frightened fugitives not to give up and turn around. Tubman \nwasnt the only one carrying a gun during her missionssome of the \nmen and women in her care would have stolen firearms from \nunsuspecting enslavers. They too understood that their flight was a \nfight.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Tubman was still unique. The facts surrounding her life are so \nincredible they seem almost impossible to believe. Born Araminta Ross \nsome time around 1822 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Tubman lived \nthrough and witnessed the violence of slaverythe selling of her \nsisters, the brutal beatings of enslaved people, and the death and \ndestruction that clung to slaverys cloak. Her marriage to a free \nman, John Tubman, and her close relationship with her family were \nthreatened in 1849 when she learned that she would be sold. After an \naborted runaway attempt with her two brothers, Tubman escaped to the \nPennsylvania border in the fall of 1849.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving made it to freedom, for the close to ten years that followed, \nshe repeatedly traveled back to Maryland to rescue her friends and \nfamily. She traveled by train and by foot through the marshy Eastern \nShore to save her loved ones from torture. Her first return trip to \nMaryland was to orchestrate the rescue of her niece from a slave \nauctionthe beginning of a sterling record of leading the enslaved \nout of bondage. Each time she went South, she did so with great \nurgency, often to protect a loved one from arrest or sale.\u0014\nTubman was unflinching in her commitment to liberation and would use \nthe power of her pistol if necessary. Later in life, Tubman stated, \nI had reasoned this out in my mind; there was one of two things I \nhad a right to, liberty, or death; if I could not have one, I would \nhave the other[.]\u0014\n\u0014\nShe knew that the law was not on her side, evidenced by the federal \ngovernments support of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which gave \nenslavers had the right to travel to any state in search of their \nhuman property, leaving no American city or town a safe haven for \nfugitives. Tubman knew that the only way to save her loved ones was \nto make them disappear.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would take a war to destroy the system of slavery. Until that day \narrived, Tubman helped her people steal away, one or a few at a time. \nShe made 12 or 13 trips to Maryland and rescued nearly 70 people, \ndefying federal law with each mission. In speaking engagements across \nnorthern cities she condemned the law of the land, taking aim at the \nsystem of slavery and the lawmakers who continued to condone it. \nAfter each speech she would disappear into a world of shadows \ninhabited only by fugitives and their allies.\u0014\n\u0014\nTubman knew then, as we know now, that in the absence of justice, \nrunning away is sometimes the only way to save a life.\u0014\n\u0014\nTIME  11/2/19\u0014",

    "title": "SUNDAR SINGH'S STORY",
    "words": "FOR MONTHS, Sundar Singh was like a person deranged. Though a Sikh (a \nmember of one of Indias major religious groups), he was attending a \nChristian school when his mother died. Consequently, he blamed the \nChristian God. Whereas before he was a quiet student, now he jeered \nin class and gathered a gang together to pelt Christian students with \ndirt and stones. Finally, he convinced his father to enroll him in a \ndifferent school, several miles away. There he contracted malaria and \nbecame seriously ill. When he recovered, he returned to the Christian \nschool. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow the fourteen-year-old boy asked serious questions and seemed more \nsubdued. However, his schoolwork was suffering. One day, he asked for \na Bible. His teachers praised God. It seemed their prayers had been \nheard. Sundar, however, had a different idea. At home, he built a \nfire and page by page tore up the Bible and burned it. His father saw \nwhat he was up to and commanded him to stop. Instead the boy thrust \nthe rest of the book into the flames. Although I believed that I had \ndone a very good deed by burning the Bible, I felt unhappy, he said \nlater. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe became so miserable that he could no longer bear life. Late on \nthis day, 19 December 1903,* he began to pray that God would reveal \nhimself if he really existed. If not, Sundar planned to throw himself \nin front of the morning train. For seven hours he prayed. O God, if \nthere is a God, reveal yourself to me tonight. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Sundar, his room filled with a glow. A man appeared \nbefore him with nail-pierced hands, saying, How long will you deny \nme? I died for you; I have given my life for you. He knew it was \nChrist. When the vision vanished, he ran, woke his father, and told \nhim he had become a Christian. Now his father thought he really was \nmad! \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sundar persisted in his faith, his family pressured him with \nevery inducement they could think of: money, sex, responsibility to \nhis family, patriotism, lies, threats, and attacks on the Christian \nschool. Finally Sundar felt there was only one course he could take \nto make clear his allegiance to Christ: He cut his long hair, which \nwas the symbol of a Sikh. Then his father cast him out, We reject \nyou forever... We shall forget you as if you had never been born. As \nhe rode the train away from home, painful cramps wrenched his gut. \nHis family had poisoned his last meal! He staggered off the train and \ncrawled to a mission station\u0014\n. \u0014\nSundar, however, miraculously recovered. As soon as he came of age, \nhe was baptized. He donned the yellow robe of a holy man, preaching \nthroughout India and later around the world, funded by his father who \nhad then converted to Christianity. Sundar also made twenty trips \ninto Tibet, where he was severely persecuted. He counted these \nsufferings as a small price to pay to demonstrate love for Christ. \nWhen we have left this world, we will not have another chance to \nbear the cross for Christ, he said. In 1929, a sickly Sundar set out \nfor Tibet one last time and was not heard from again.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "SHAMELESS - A REVIEW",
    "words": "Sex-ed for those who love God but reject traditional church teachings \non sex\u0014\nReviewed i11/15/20 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn her third and most recent book Shameless: A Sexual Reformation, \nunorthodox Lutheran Minister Nadia Bolz-Weber examines many of the \nmore troubling and controversial messages of traditional Christian \nchurches on the subject of sex and sexuality. As part of a call for \nchurches and their parishioners to undergo an examination and an \nexploration of what their churches have taught on about sexual \nmatters, she makes the case that the time has come (or more \naccurately, that it is long overdue) to reconsider and for the most \npart reject many church teachings on controversial subjects such as \npre-marital abstinence, homosexuality, birth control, abortion, \ntransgenderism, and pornography, among others. Her message is that \nrather than aspire to attain some impossible as well as impractical \nstandard, and hate ourselves for our inability to attain that \nstandard, we should instead accept and embrace our true selves, \nwhether or not we measure up to the sexual standards set by \ntraditional religion, so long as we aspire to follow the central New \nTestament commandment to \"love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author is not your traditional old-style preacher. Heavily \ntattooed and purple-haired, the former stand-up comedian is a \nrecovering alcoholic with over 20 years sobriety, a divorced mother \nof two college-aged children, whose language is frequently peppered \nwith f-bombs and other swear-jar contributing language. She is the \nPastor of Denver's House for All Sinners and Saints, where she \nministers to many of those who present as outcasts to many \ntraditional congregations. Her parishioners include members of the \nLGBTQ community, sex trade workers, and generally those who reject \nmany of traditional Christian churches' teachings on such matters as \npre-marital sex, abortion, creationism, the literal acceptance of \nbible verses and other antiquated dogma that are rejected by many \nbecause they simply don't make sense, or because they don't accord \nwith contemporary notions of kindness and love for other human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author's parishioners feature at the center of many of the \nchapters in the book's 200 pages (with their names changed to protect \nthe innocent.) The book's salient points are personified by the \nstories of church members who are recovering alcoholics and addicts, \ncutters, those who tried to live up to their churches' teachings on \nabstinence or heterosexuality, falsely believing that their strong \ncontrary instincts were some form of an abomination in the eyes of a \nsupposedly loving god. Bolz-Weber herself is revealing of her own \nstory in an extremely vulnerable way, describing her personal \nexperiences of a teen-age pregnancy and a child given up for \nadoption, a subsequent abortion, and her own struggle to attempt to \nreconcile old testament condemnations with the realities of the lives \nof her church members and a call to love rather than to condemn.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoogle online reviews of this book and you will discover many \nconservative critics castigating Bolz-Weber as heretical for \ndistorting what they say is the true word of God. Much of what is \ncontained in the book will be offensive to orthodox Christians, \nincluding the author's defense of abortion and her support for the \nLGBTQ community. In the former case, she refers to scriptural \npassages that are authority for the proposition that life begins with \nbreath and recounts the history of how this was once the generally \nadopted position of most Christian churches. She refers to the work \nof religious scholars who make the case that abortion became a part \nof the evangelical political agenda at a time when racist \ninstitutions such as Bob Jones University risked losing their \ntax-exempt status, using abortion as a means of holding the coalition \ntogether by grasping on to it as a new unifying issue. In response to \nthose who cite various old testament verses in support of sexual \nchastity and against same-sex unions, the author notes how neither of \nthese messages are contained in Christ's gospels, the central tenets \nof which are love for one's neighbor, the recognition that everyone \nis our neighbor, and that rash judgement of others is hypocritical \nwhen such judgement is passed by those who are themselves not \n\"without sin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShameless will be an anathema to those who adhere to fundamentalist \nChristian beliefs. Conversely, for those who felt unwelcome in the \ntraditional church because the church's teachings were innately at \nodds with their true moral compass, or because they felt like square \npegs being forced into round holes, Nadia Bolz-Weber's understanding \nof God's love for such people offers a more welcoming message, a more \nsensible vision that is better reconciled with Christ's teachings of \nlove for one another, and refusal to hate or condemn those who are \ndifferent in ways that do not tangibly harm others. The author offers \nhope for those who feel hopeless, love for those who feel that they \nare unlovable, and worth for those who have been made to feel that \nthey are worthless, merely for being who their Creator made them to \nbe.\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\nReviewed on March 31, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nFor over 30 years of faith-- a faith that never dealt seriously with \nmy sexuality or had the courage to directly broach the topic I've \nsearched for ministers and teachers in the faith to stand out in \nhonesty and faith. Rev. booze we her dared to speak out candidly and \nwith humility about the subject we all live with and deal on a day to \nday basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe curses, she is fragile, but this is her strength in speaking \ntruth to power of how we are both sexual and spiritual beings in this \nlife. She encompasses Scripture with fact and on the ground lives and \nliving to make clear that our sexuality is not our enemy, but it is a \npart of our human make up and is not God shuns or is surprised by. In \nfact, she is one of the few voices in the faith to frankly say that \nour spirituality and sexuality can communion together honestly and \nwith life while still upholding the hallmarks of the Gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe is by far one of the best Christian voices I've had the pleasure \nto enjoy reading. This book should be in the hands of anyone who \nwants a realistic and candid approach to the subject of sex and the \nChristian faith.\u0014",

Didn't \nyou do your part before God did His?\"  The new Christian jumped to \nhis feet and said, \"Oh, yes, I did.  For more than 30 years I ran \naway from God as fast as my sins could carry me.  That was my part.  \nBut God took out after me and ran me down.  That was His part.\"  \nCommenting on this testimony, Ironside wrote, \"It was well put and \ntells a story that every redeemed sinner understands.\"\u0014",

    "words": "The immortal hymn \"God Moves In A Mysterious Way\" has been a source \nof great comfort and blessing to God's people.  Yet few know of the \ntrying circumstances which led to its composition. The writer, \nWilliam Cowper, had sunk to the depths of despair as the result of \ngrief and disappointment. Finally one foggy night, in a state of \ndepression he called for a horse-drawn \"taxi\" and asked to be taken \nto London Bridge on the Thames River, intending to commit suicide.  \nAfter driving around in the mist for 2 hours, the cabby reluctantly \ntold his passenger he was lost.  Disgusted by the delay, Cowper left \nthe cab and determined to find his way on foot.  Walking only a short \ndistance, he discovered he was back at his own doorstep! They'd been \ngoing in circles. Immediately he recognized the restraining hand of \nthe Lord in this providential turn of events.  Convicted by the \nSpirit, he realized that the way out of his troubles was to look to \nGod for help, not to jump into the river.  As he cast his burden on \nthe Savior, his heart was comforted.  With tears of gratitude he sat \ndown and penned these words which have strengthened thousands on the \nbrink of despair:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"God moves in a mysterious way\u0014\n      His wonders to perform;\u0014\n    He plants his footsteps in the sea,\u0014\n      And rides upon the storm.\u0014\n    Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;\u0014\n      The clouds ye so much dread\u0014\n    Are big with mercy, and shall break\u0014\n      In blessings on your head.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Gary Inrig writes about a terrible airline accident that occurred in \nthe Canary Islands in April of 1977.  At the small airport at \nTenerife two 747s collided killing hundreds:  \"The airport was \ncrowded because the main airport at Las Palmas had been closed due to \na bombing.  As a result, the 747s had to taxi on the runway rather \nthan on the taxiway. It was a foggy day, and the two pilots could not \nsee one another, but, for some inexplicable reason, the Dutch pilot \nbegan his takeoff without clearance from the control tower. \nObviously, he thought he was doing the right thing, but he was not.  \nThe other plane was in the way, and he was unable to avoid it.  As a \nresult, 575 people died.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Every pilot is taught one very basic lesson at the beginning of \nhis training.  In an air traffic control zone, you do not do what \nseems best in your eyes; you do what the control tower tells you to \ndo.  That is always true, but it is especially true when the \nvisibility is bad.  The reason is, of course, very simple.  The \ncontroller knows things that you do not know.  He has better \ninformation and a better perspective to guide a pilot safely to his \ndestination.  To act on your own causes disasters.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"That is an obvious principle of aviation, but it is also an \nimportant principle of life.  We live at a time when a thick moral \nfog has settled upon our society.  The old moral landmarks have been \nobliterated, and no one seems to know the difference between right \nand wrong.  Ethically and morally, the visibility is nil.  It is very \ntempting, at such a time, to fly by the seat of your pants, living by \nyour own standards, doing whatever is right in your own eyes.  \nScripture gives us a vivid picture of what happens when we follow \nthat method.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Hearts of Iron, Feet of Clay by Gary Inrig.

During his imprisonment, the manuscript of the \nNew Testament commentary that had been his life's work was seized and \ndestroyed.  When he was finally released from prison, the authorities \ndeclared him a `nonperson,' which meant it was impossible for him to \nfind a job.  He was effectively stripped of everything and lived in \npoverty.  His testimony, as well as his life, seemed insignificant.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Then the same church where Professor Hill had previously served \nand been betrayed reluctantly invited him to come back on staff \nbecause he was the only one the church could find who knew Greek, \nHebrew, Latin, and English as well as his native language.  The \nprofessor agreed, and when I had the privilege of meeting him 15 \nyears later, he was still serving in that church alongside the same \nstaff member who had turned him in to the authorities 40 years \nearlier!\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"I looked at Professor Hill and knew I was seeing someone who had \nbeen afflicted, who was poor, who had been slandered by the religious \ncommunity--yet he was rich!

    "words": "Jeremiah Meneely was an Irish farmer (1832-1917) that God used \nmightily during the 1859-60 revival in Northern Ireland.  The \nawakening began with Jeremiah and three other young men meeting every \nnight in an old schoolhouse to pray for revival. They prayed for \nthree solid months without any visible results.  Then on New Year's \nDay, they saw one conversion.  After that there were conversions \nevery night.  By the end of the year, there were 50 young men taking \npart in the prayer meetings.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When crowds of unconverted people began to come, they decided that \nJeremiah Meneely should preach to them.  He agreed only on the \ncondition that the others would pray for him.  Meneely wrote later, \n\"I yelled, they prayed, and God worked.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   God brought the whole community under conviction and many people \nwere coming to Christ. Not long after that, Meneely was asked to go \nand preach in a town about five miles away.  When he arrived there, \nthe building was jammed with people.  He made his way to the front \nand preached.  When he told the crowd they were dismissed, no one \nleft.  So he preached another sermon and again dismissed the people.  \nThey still did not want to leave.  The same thing happened again.  \nAfter preaching four times, he stepped outside, took off his shirt, \nand wrung the perspiration out of it.  He put his shirt back on, went \ninside and preached one more sermon before walking the five miles \nhome.  By then it was after midnight.\u0014\n\u0014\n   He had only been home a few minutes when he heard a knock on the \ndoor.  There stood a man asking how to be saved.  Meneely took him to \nhis neighbor's house and knocked on the door loud enough to wake his \nneighbor, shouting, \"What, lying in bed and souls seeking Christ!\"\u0014\n   [Uplook, Jun 1996.

    "words": "When J. L. Harris died, several people at the funeral shared stories \nabout his life, including this one:  During the Depression years \nHarris lived in rural Tennessee.  One day he was driving down a back \nroad and saw a farmer out plowing his field.  He pulled over and sat \nthere watching. After a while, he got out and walked over to where \nthe farmer was working.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"I'm not sure why, but I just feel impressed to give you this \nmoney,\" Harris said, as he handed him $18.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The farmer was quite taken aback by this.  He finally said, \"You \nknow, when I got up this morning, I knew I didn't have enough money \nto buy seed for planting.  This money will buy enough seed to plant \nmy whole field.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The remarkable thing about this story is not so much Harris' \ngenerosity or that he would give money away just on impulse.  The \namazing thing is the faith and vision of that farmer.  He was out \nthere plowing even though he didn't have any seed to put in the \nground, but he believed God was telling him to plow anyway.  He \nbelieved in spite of the circumstances, and God honored that by \nchanging the circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Physician, Jul/Aug 1998.  Page 9.]\u0014",
